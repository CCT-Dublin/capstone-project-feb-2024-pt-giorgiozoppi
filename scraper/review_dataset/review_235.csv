235,Aussies in Ireland,This was a excellent hotel in close proximity to the airport. The shuttle service is perfect for those early morning flights. There is a restaurant with very reasonable prices and the rooms were very pleasant. we would definitely stay there again.,5,2024,10,18
235,1 night stay before flight home,"The rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable and cannot complain at all regarding the room at all! 
On check in the lady at the desk beginning with an R was very friendly and helpful and funny and made good feeling for me! 
I booked my shuttle to airport and checked out as per usual routine i thought. 
So whilst waiting the man at the recepetion. Jake (manager of bar) but also reception He approached and gave a better understanding of shuttle service and said i more than welcome to wait and have a coffee and went made me a coffee which above and beyond i thought! 
So if you wanting to stay for a brief stay for the airport or longer i would definitely recommend this hotel personally!",5,2024,10,11
235,"Very comfortable, everything is clean and works.","After a beautiful three week vacation in Ireland four of us spent our last night in this apartment.  We found it clean, in new condition, a well maintained kitchen and warm.  Every other place in our three weeks turned the heat off at 19:00 and back on at 07:00.  We were forced to get well tucked into our comforters.  This apartment was comfortable and warm.  This is not a place to beat to death on your last night in Ireland!  Take good care of it, I want to use it again.",5,2024,10,09
235,Beware of the bartender!,"We were looking for a comfortable room for our last night before going to the airport. We checked in and just wanted to relax in the bar and have a drink. Upon entering the bar we were pounced on by the bartender asking us if we had a reservation. We said we just wanted to get a drink but he proceeded with grilling us if we were eating. We really were not sure at that point and it seemed silly that he would be pressing this because there were plenty of open bar stools. Needless to say we left due to his aggressive attitude. After all.. who wants to be served by a grumpy bartender! Unfortunately there is nothing really close within walking distance to this hotel.
The rooms were basic yet comfortable.",3,2024,09,23
235,Such a wonderful Hotel,"Arrived at this hotel on Saturday 31st August for 1 night. On the way to the Hotel my husband became unwell. The staff at the Hotel went over and above in assisting us making sure my husband was comfortable. Sorting out our luggage and assisting with parking. Thank you to all involved the Reception Staff Bar/Restaurant Staff Jake and Amanda, Federica the Duty Manager and also the Bus Driver who parked my car. Can't thank them enough for the care we received. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Everything was up to a very high standard. Rooms spotlessly clean food excellent and exceptional friendly and caring staff.",5,2024,09,16
235,Great airport hotel,"We stayed at the metro hotel recently before an early flight from Dublin Airport. The room was very clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and the complimentary shuttle service from 4am much appreciated. We will definitely stay again!",5,2024,08,20
235,"No AC, no air, no sleep, not worth it. Caregul with the neighbourhood","We chose this hotel because we wanted to be close tp the airport due to early flight and be guaranteed a proper and good night sleep after nearly three weeks travelling in Ireland.  Room is spacious, but air condition did not work and  it was on. It was installed obvious just for show. I got no sleep. I don't mind the traffic, or the thin walls, but no decent AC and not able to open windows fully, made the night unbearable.",1,2024,08,14
235,Nice hotel,"In a handy spot close to where we needed to go. This is our second time to stay here but sadly I can’t see us returning unless we were guaranteed a room away from the road. The traffic didn’t stop all night and I hardly slept, I managed to get about an hour in the morning due to sheer exhaustion. We had a little apartment which is ideal for myself my husband and two children. Strange though how the tea making facilities are in the room with the bunk beds which is very obviously for the kids, luckily our two are older and sensible enough not to play with the kettle. There was only one bin in the rooms so we had to share. Plenty nice clean towels and soap etc. The staff on the reception are very nice and helpful especially Yusuf who checked us in and helped us to retrieve our disabled parking spot when an able bodied man had parked in it after we’d returned from dinner in another establishment. I would love to return but as everyone knows sleep is the most important part of a hotel stay and as this was my biggest issue I can’t see us returning, which I’m really sad about because it’s in such a great spot.",3,2024,08,08
235,"Room ok, food and drink terrible","What an utter disappointment. Came to the bar to have dinner with kids. Got a terrible pint of Guinness , head was massive, Luke warm and obviously lacking in gas.  Then the food, hot wings with blue cheese and celery sticks came as bbq wings with thick blue cheese sauce! We ate them, but they weren’t what we ordered. Server was extremely loud and intense, asked him if I could have plain pasta with kids nuggets. He said probably not but he’d ask the ‘chef’! Returned to say chef was doing him a favour and we could have the pasta… hooray! Pasta arrived with tomato sauce and when I said we asked for plain he said No, the chef already did me a favour. So wasted pasta (probably costing about 10c) but charging a lot more. Then the nuggets, they obviously ran out of one cheap type and then supplemented with a different type. All as bad as each other. Dont order the curry, my husband paid extra for prawns and there was about 4 or 5 max.. curry is Indian, thick and dry… overall, the worst meal I have eaten in years… which isn’t good when they are charging so much. Hotel overall very average. Friendly front of house staff, that’s about it. As they say ‘Never again!!’",1,2024,08,07
235,Does what it says on the tin,"Located very close to Dublin Airport, it is an ideal stop for travelers. Getting into town is, of course , a longer trip. Check in was easy and our apartment on the 13th floor was quite nice with an amazing terrace and views. Only 2 issues we had were the inferno in the corridor from the lift to the apartment (bad design by the architect) and the heavy fire doors in each room with a strong spring, which kept banging the doors behind us every time we entered or left a room. Otherwise it was great",4,2024,07,31
235,Nice and modern - good restaurant ,"It was a surprisingly nice hotel. Outside doesn't look too flash but the bar and rooms were nice and modern. We also got the free shuttle bus from the airport that runs about every 30 mins. 

Overall it was a nice 1 night stay before heading off into Ireland. 

We did have an issue with the shower controls being stiff and unusable and the staff were difficult to get a hold of. 

Other than that it was a nice stay",4,2024,07,08
235,Not great,"Before arriving at the hotel we rang up to discuss an early check-in, to which the member of staff was very abrupt and informed us that a room could probably be available before 2 but to 100% guarantee it it would be a 20€ charge. This was fine however he kept insisting us to not do this as a room should be ready. Upon check-in, we paid 5€ for on-sight parking. The underground car park was in shambles and there was cars just dumped in them and so were forced to park just outside the main entrance. The room itself was very basic with a broken sink stopper and toilet paper holder. We asked for help with this and was told we didn’t need a sink full of water to shave, which is why I wanted it. The staff weren’t accommodating and provided no information regarding the amenities, check out time, breakfast or anything.",2,2024,07,07
235,Metro stay,"We stayed in the two bedroom apartment in the 15 floor. 1501.   Nice view.   Very heavy fire doors for every room that slammed loudly when closest.   Nice to have 2 full bathrooms and 2 bedrooms, one  king and 2 twins.  It was warm so we opened all windows and used the fans positive: All above plus for longer stays there is a washer, full refrig, microwave, kitchen supplies and stove top, balcony and full living area. Negative: furniture could use updating, hot water use the booster, only one elevator. We booked one night so we were close to the airport and there was a free shuttle.    We took a bus into Dublin City for the evening. Chose  to eat breakfast around the corner at a lovely cafe called The Grain instead of Metro.",4,2024,07,07
235,Average hotel,It’s a very basic hotel with all the amenities needed. Breakfast was pretty bad with very few options for how much it cost. Would recommend just walking down the street to go one of the several cafes in the area. Beds were clean and they had A/C and as an American that was very welcome.,3,2024,06,29
235,Absolutely perfect in all aspects.,"Travelled to Dublin for a concert and stayed for 2 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment. 

Some bullet points.

Location = Perfect

Staff = All super friendly and very helpful, especially Bar staff and Shuttle drivers !

Bar/Restaurant= Food was as good, if not better, than any restaurant I've eaten in. The prices were very reasonable compared to the crazy prices in town and the quality was 10/10. Servers were all very good with great manners and knowledge.

Accommodation: Large, spotless, great views and a super comfortable bed.

Would i stay here again, absolutely. Would i eat here again, 100% !

Overall superb.",5,2024,06,24
235,Get her booked,"Great hotel, all the staff are excellent from you arrive. Smiling and helpful, food is excellent, especially the squid. 
In the bar mostly after work. The two bar men deserve a special mention, the two J,s 
They are great craic, nothings a problem, very attentive and helpful and BOTH great cocktail makers
Professional to a T

Gerry Hegarty",5,2024,06,17
235,Very good close to airport option,"For 2 couples traveling together the apartment room on the 13th floor was a good choice. Reasonably priced for four, the 2 bedrooms, 2 baths and kitchen/living area were all spotless, and comfortable. A coffee/tea maker was ready to go, and the kitchen had all the necessities to cook whatever your bring. The bar was comfy and the restaurant good for the price. And that is good, because the drawback is that there is really nothing to do withing walking distance of this place. But for a place to stay to get ready to catch that morning flight out, this place is a very good choice, especially with its complimentary airport shuttle!",4,2024,06,04
235,Stayed here due to late flight  no late shuttle overcharged as well,No late shuttle to hotel duplicate charge put on my card cant get this resolved staff food in the bar ok not any better than the airport overall poor wont use this hotel again overpriced for what you get very disappointed hotel room was ok and good shower,1,2024,05,27
235,My wife and I had a great time at the Metro,"Flew in from the US and stayed with my wife. Had a great experience with everything. The location is perfect, just 10 minutes from the airport. They had a free shuttle. Rooms were clean, we liked the design. Restaurant had great dinner and breakfast. And the people were super nice!!",5,2024,05,23
235,Best hotel near Dublin Airport,"We had a fantastic one week stay at the 2-Bedroom Apartments at the Metro Hotel. The apartments have everything you need for an extended stay, more than anything we loved the balcony with the lovely views over Dublin. The hotel is close to Dublin Airport and a short 20-minute bus ride from the city centre, so the location was perfect for us.  We had breakfast in the restaurant on most mornings and dinner on some evenings, the food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,05,23
235,Ok hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights . The hotel is 10 min away from the airport and it has a shuttle every 30 min . The staff were very friendly.
The room (I got an apartment) was in need of some TLC . One day I needed to talk to the reception and it was not possible , the line was always engaged . Then another day I got a call in my room at 4am !?.

There is a public bus stop just by the hotel , which is very convenient, however, the area where the hotel is located , is not the greatest. So be mindful if you are walking at night.

The breakfast , was ok. No, too much options if you don’t want a hot breakfast .",3,2024,05,18
235,Our Dublin holiday,"I would like to commend Frederica on reception for sorting our issues out. She went above and beyond her duty to ensure we had a very comfortable stay at the Metro hotel. The bedrooms are furnished to a high standard and thankfully, fully air conditioned.",4,2024,05,15
235,Avoid for park and transfer to airport unless you want to be told to get a taxi when you land at airport!,"Avoid park and transfer to the airport. It's fine on the way to the airport but bus is a no show on the way back ) happened twice, second time was giving them another chance that won't happen again!)
7 calls to reception and other staff because no one could reach reception after initial calls to find out where the bus was and my number was left with no return call. Bus eventually showed up and reception had no customers - no idea why no return call and no other staff could reach them - to be told by freqerique ""I understand"" repeatedly and I should have gotten a taxi. Taxis don't have car seats, if I'd wanted a taxi I wouldn't have used them at all. Shocking experience will never book again!!!!!",1,2024,05,15
235,Don’t book park stay and fly with this hotel,Don’t book park fly and stay at this hotel. I phoned hotel after collecting baggage following return flight. Told bus would be at airport in three minutes. Bus did not arrive. Phoned again after 15 minutes and was told they didn’t know where bus was but would find out and phone me back. (I am still waiting for this phone call). Phoned again after 45 minutes and was told the buses serve airport every 30 minutes at 15 minutes and 45 minutes after the hour. I informed them that I had been at the waiting point at these times and no bus had arrived. They were unable to confirm where the bus or when it would arrive at airport. After one hour waiting I got a taxi to the hotel at a cost of €30. When I told the person in reception that bus had not called to airport he  firstly said that the driver was on his break and when I pushed further he said it was currently at the airport as he could see it on the “tracker system”. This was the first time that a tracker system was mentioned. When he discovered that I hadn’t got a receipt from the taxi driver he immediately offered to refund fare if I could produce receipt. As this happened on bank holiday Monday I firmly believe that the bus was never at the airport and I was pawned off with made up excuses that changed when challenged.,1,2024,05,06
235,"Lovely place, great staff, fairly priced, just dry food!!","Lots of positives for this place. I booked my suite for the wrong date (23/04 instead of 24/04) and only realised the day before the wrong booking. I called the hotel and they kindly changed my booking at no extra charge. 

We got to Dublin airport and there is a complementary shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel - what a lovely chap driving this bus. Very friendly, helpful and kind. 

The staff at the hotel, again fabulous. 

Our suite was very comfortable, very spacious, clean and nicely decorated. 

We decided that as we had to be back at the airport the following day (and after a long day in Dublin City) we would have dinner in the restaurant in the hotel. I had a starter of Dublin Smoked Salmon with crème fresh with a small dressed salad. this was lovely. My partner had the fish cake with a small side salad, he said it tasted good. Both dishes presented beautifully. For our mains I ordered the stuffed chicken wrapped in bacon and instead of chips, rice or mashed potatoes I had a salad with it. My partner ordered Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was great, sadly my stuffed chicken was so dry it just failed - I ate it as I was hungry.

The next morning we had breakfast. Everything well presented and the breakfast choice was fabulous. However, dried food again. Where the hot food sits under the heat lamps it just dried out the scrambled eggs, bacon and the cardboard tasting black and white puddings. The sausages were fine. Such a shame this place can’t quite get the food offerings up to the same standard as everything else in this place. 

Price wise - very reasonable. Our suite was €160 with breakfast for the night. The restaurant was very reasonably priced and a pint of Guinness was only €6 a pint. 
I will definitely stay here again, but may chose differently for my dinner.",4,2024,04,25
235,Fantastic,Had an overnight stay there after a hospital appointment in St James. We must say this is an excellent place to stay. Lovely room and the cleanliness was A1. The staff were all so friendly and helpful and the food was amazing. We ate every bite from dinner to breakfast which  had a large selection of choices to offer. Would recommend to everyone. So thank you to all staff in metro 😊,5,2024,04,13
235,Terrible airport shuttle service,"Used this hotel for parking. The bus wouldnt wait for 3 minutes for us and we had to pay €17 for a taxi to the airport. The driver was extremely abrupt! On the way home i rang the hotel & was told the bus wouldnt pick us up for 50 minutes (after an 8 hour flight)
Will never be using this hotel again!!!!",1,2024,04,06
235,Perfect overnight stop,We had a quick over night stay at the Metro. It was clean and comfortable. The bar area had a good selection of food. The waiting staff were very helpful. We took the shuttle bus to the airport while leaving our car parked for 4 more days. I accidently left my phone charger behind and the hotel staff kept it behind the desk for me to pick up on my return. I was most grateful for this and send my thanks to the staff. ,5,2024,04,02
235,Absolutely the best Dublin Airport Hotel,"This is by far the best hotel near Dublin airport.  I fly from Dublin frequently and will  stay nowhere else. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable.  The restaurant is excellent, with fine food and service from Jake and Amanda, who could not have treated us better. ",4,2024,02,12
235,GREAT STAY AND DINING EXPERIENCE!,"Fantastic Apartment and Great Restaurant!!!
This is my second time coming to stay at the metro hotel prior to flying out of Dublin Airport. Friends and I share a two bedroom apartment which has one bedroom, en suite, and one bedroom with its own bathroom across the hall. Lovely appointed rooms with everything you need and a fantastic Kitchen/living room area as well with a big flatscreen TV. 

One of the great perks is the fantastic restaurant downstairs. We have eaten here both times, and I have to say the food is top-notch! Tonight I had chicken wings to start and steak and it couldn’t get any better!  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious!!

An extra bonus is the fantastic staff for funny and enjoyable, and very attentive! Tonight we were served by Amanda and Jake, and just a wonderful dining experience from beginning to end. Highly recommended.!  I know where I’m staying next time I have to fly out of Dublin Airport.!",4,2024,02,12
235,Always a pleasant experience here at the Metro Hotel.,"Fantastic meal at the restaurant. Hats off to the the chef and our servers, Jake and Amanda. We have been here before and the food and service is consistently top-notch. The Thai fish cake starter was wonderful and the steak was perfect. We will be back!",5,2024,02,12
235,Comfortable hotel in Dublin suburbs with airport shittle,"It’s very convenient having a shuttle bus to and from the airport, though it wasn’t so obvious where to find the pickup place in the parking area behind the church across the way from the airport terminal. The bus drivers both to and from the airport were very friendly and tried to be helpful. We’re mother tongue English and could understand 70% of what the first driver was saying – but the following day that was only about 30% as he had such a strong Irish accent. This was amusing rather than a problem! The hotel room was spacious and comfortable. There was a supporting pillar in the middle of the room, which was unusual. I’d been hoping for a view but there wasn’t much to see from our window (although it’s a multi-storey building the hotel occupies only the lower few floors. We were told how to take the bus from a nearby bus stop into central Dublin and so we were able to sample the lively evening scene down there.",5,2024,01,18
235,Thank you,"Thank you to Kati and all at Metro Hotel for a lovely stay recently. My daughter was having surgery in Santry and I didn't fancy getting up at 4am for a long drive to Dublin. We were able to stay, got an affordable rate and we slept like logs. Santry Sports Clinic was just a couple of minutes drive away so it was perfect!",5,2024,01,08
235,Rude staff ,"Did not have a great experience with this hotel. My boyfriend and I had just flown back to Ireland from Edinburgh. We made our way straight to the hotel by taxi. When we arrived we were informed that we must be over 23 to check in. While it was not highlighted clearly when we booked, only visible when you click into the hotels policies, this information was available to us. The two staff at the desk found this quite amusing. We certainly did not as we live 3 hours from Dublin and we were certainly displeased at the two members of staff who smirked and giggled at us as they told us we couldn’t stay. They issued a refund which would not come into my account for 5+ working days. We were left with no where to stay and all of our luggage from the flight to haul around with us. This was completely unreasonable. It would be understandable if we were under the age of 18 but I am 20 years of age. This is the first I have ever heard of a hotel not allowing people under the age of 23 to check in. I find this ridiculous and will definitely not be staying here and will not be recommending this establishment to anyone. The reason I am writing this is because of the treatment from the two staff members at the desk. To laugh in our faces when we told them what age we are. With no apology from either of them. Do better.",1,2023,12,03
235,Comfortable stay 15 minutes from the airport,A comfortable and recently updated room and a friendly and helpful staff made for a great stay prior to our flight home. Although it is near the airport it only took about half an hour on a single bus to get to the city centre. The airport shuttle service was prompt and courteous.,5,2023,10,17
235,I’m Leaving on A Jet Plane! I’ll Defo be Back Again ;) ,"Title Says it All Folks!

Returned to The Metro Hotel almost a year to the day again, though this time for Leisure, Not Business. Arrived late afternoon and was checked into Apartment 1001. The Apartment, while not as high up as last year, it was just as spacious, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and massive kitchen and living room space with balcony overlooking Dublin, which later in the evening was even better as some of the locals gave us a fantastic fireworks display. 

Myself and my partner dined in the hotel later that evening, ordering the soup and the wings, as well as two tasty deserts. A fabulous dinner served by wonderful attentive staff! 

Upon returning to the apartment we headed off to sleep, beds very comfy which was good as we were up early the next morning. The hotel does have a fitness room which is currently under construction, however there is another gym 2 minutes down the road which allow for walk ins at a cheap rate which as fine. 

Breakfast was good, full buffet and continental options. We were served by the wonderful Federica who really brightens up your morning no matter how early it is, even seeing us off the premises as we left for the airport. 

Guys, you know I love it here! I’ll be back again before too long!
",5,2023,10,14
235,Well worth it,"Highly recommend. It's easy to get to from the airport + they offer a $free shuttle service. The bus stop and Spar (mini supermarket) are within a 5 minute walk. The service is good, the bed comfortable, and the shower hot. Will be using them again, for sure",5,2023,10,05
235,A budget hotel,"You're not paying for a spacious room or nice décor or a highly trained staff or prompt shuttle service.  The room was clean, the shower worked, and it was quiet at night.  Don't plan on getting dinner there:  the restaurant staff--who appeared stretched (and stressed) well beyond their limit--said that it was a half-hour wait for service at 8:00 on a Sunday night.",3,2023,10,03
235,Do NOT book this hotel,"I emailed the hotel reception back in December 2022 requesting a quote for a park and fly for 16 nights for this September. I received an email from reception quoting a price for the 16 nights and I replied confirming agreement to the price.

Imagine my surprise when, just like the previous reviewer, I was told on arrival at the Metro that the price previously quoted was incorrect. If I wanted the full 16 nights - which I did - I would have to pay an additional amount, otherwise my car would be clamped. After 'discussing' this with the guy on reception, the additional price quoted was halved and then halved again. But I still had to pay it. The receptionist concerned was quite snotty too ""if you don't want to pay, go someplace else"". I even told him I had an email confirming the agreed price and he wanted to see it. So I showed him the email and the reply I got was "" well, I don't care. That price quoted was incorrect and you'll have to pay extra if I still want 16 nights"". Arriving the night before a 2 week holiday, where else could we go? And the hotel had already debited my credit card with the previously agreed amount. That was Strike 1. 

Strike 2 was we had requested a wake up call for 3:15am to get on the 4am bus. Guess what. No wake up call. Luckily we'd set our own alarm so we were up. I went downstairs to find the guy on reception doing nothing. It was 3:50am at the time and he had nothing to do. So much 'nothing', he hadn't rang any of the rooms with a wake up call. We boarded the 4am bus to hear him ring a room, apologise for no wake up call and explain that he could get this couple on the 4:30 or 5am bus if it wasn't overbooked. A great comfort for those who booked and wanted the 4am bus. 

The room itself was fabulous. Very comfortable and spacious. Such a shame the hotel is let down by staff that don't care and want to extort more money from guests no matter what was agreed previously. 

NEVER trust an email from the hotel quoting a price. It won't be the final price. Just don't stay here. Simple as.",1,2023,10,01
235,Poor ,"Booked through booking and got a message in the app from the hotel to verify my payment and enter my card information. It was a scam and hotel blamed booking and booking blamed hotel.
I had to cancel my card 3 days before I left for my holiday.
1 day before we arrived they said card on file wasn’t passing pre authorisation. I rang the hotel and they didn’t seem to want to let me pay when we arrived. 
I paid with a different card over the phone.
We arrived late 3.30am as our flight was delayed due to storm. 
At 4.30 we had staff knocking on our door about a noise complaint. We had both been fast asleep and rudely awoken.
Then at 9am the cleaner comes in even though check out is it 12!
Safe to say we didn’t get a great nights sleep. 
Will not be staying here again and we left this feedback at reception.  ",1,2023,09,28
235,Good hotel reasonably close to airport.,"The Metro Hotel Dublin Airport is about five kilometres from Dublin Airport. It does have a shuttle bus to and from the airport, the problem is that you have to contact the hotel to come and get you, unlike other hotel shuttles that are on a timetabled loop. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, my room had wifi, tea and coffee facilities, fridge and tv.",4,2023,09,28
235,"Loved it - very cool, renovated room and easy airport access","We stayed here the night before flying out of Dublin airport and absolutely loved it. We stayed in a renovated (air conditioned) room at the pinnacle of the hotel, so our room was triangular. Rooms were super clean and very modern. The bed was very comfy. 

If you get the airport shuttle, you’ll see a bunch of very visible shuttles and one that’s got a paper taped in the window.  You do have to look for it at the shuttle spot.",5,2023,09,23
235,Expectations vs reality,"I visited the hotel upon arrival in Dublin. I had booked a suite and mistakenly thought it had two beds for my adult son, and I. When I was shown the room, it had one king bed, so I asked to rebook to a twin room. That went fine. However, when I checked out I found that even though the price for the twin room was approximately $50 cheaper than the price for the suite which was $200 I was not going to be reimbursed. Also, when we arrived at the shuttle place at the airport, we waited 30 minutes, called the hotel and told that they would not be sending a Chateau but they did offer to pay for an Uber which they did.",1,2023,09,23
235,BEWARE OF THEFT !! Cleaners stole my things,"I enjoyed my stay, lovely room and after a busy weekend conference I stayed for an overnight flight stay, upon checking out I left a £200 new sweatshirt hanging on the back of my bathroom door, realised this and wasn’t too concerned about having it returned to me as a reputable hotel 
I was wrong!!!
Many calls, and to be told….. ,it’s not here, simple
SHOCKING 
No apology 
No response from management 
I WOULD AVOID AS THIS IS SHOCKING 
",2,2023,09,18
235,"Clean and comfortable rooms, well located for early flight.","The hotel is fine.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night for a couple of minutes which was a rude way to wake up.  Not sure why. 

We had drinks and dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was good.  Server was good as well though perhaps they were understaffed as it seemed he was serving the entire restaurant which is fairly big.",4,2023,08,30
235,Awful Experience ,"Only stay here if there is absolutely nowhere else to stay! In fairness the apartment was lovely and roomy, if  seriously overheated. The staff, on the other hand, were dreadful. The receptionist Alicia, needs to learn to listen as it took her four times of telling and seriously explaining to, for her to understand that we had been charged twice. Once she did understand, the reasoning we were given for the error was frankly unbelievable and it took forever to put right. During our stay(one night, thank goodness!) the lift broke down, not anyone's fault obviously but we were on 11rh floor with two toddlers. The staff offered no help, in spite of our circumstances and we bumped our luggage down 22 flights of stairs in order to leave. The breakfast staff were equally dreadful, unhelpful, rude and somewhat forgetful.....we asked 3 times for coffee. Overall I would never stay here again if it were the last hotel in Dublin. The one star is for Aslan who at least kept us informed of the lift problems and let us know when it was fixed. Awful experience never to be repeated.",1,2023,08,24
235,Receptionist needs Customer service training,"The hotel is really lovely. Rooms Very nice too. I worked in hospitality for 15 years as a manager and the young receptionist that was there on the morning of 8.08 needs some proper Customer service training. Asked her if I can extend my stay  because my wife is undergoing a surgery at Beaumont Hospital and I need to stay longer and ahe said there were only twin rooms left. Fair play it was fine with me. Asked if she could give me a similar price as previous nights ,she said Its €170. Showed no interest in selling that room to me. So, I went to my room and booked it online for €150. When checking out she did not even ask how was my stay, nothing. I think she needs Good Customer service training! Other than that everyone else, Restaurant, Bar and Housekeepers were lovely and the hotel is really good and in great location. ",2,2023,08,08
235,Beautiful hotel - Pity about the busy intersection right beside it .,"Lovely hotel, we stayed in an apartment on the 13th floor , lovely clean apartment, But the noise from the extremely busy road beside it is awful , we were on the 13th floor and I felt like I had a motorway running through my bedroom , such a pity as we spent the evening in the restaurant/bar area having dinner and watching a local Gaa match , food was lovely , staff were excellent, ambience around the restaurant was very relaxing , The noise from the road - we didn’t sleep at all, maybe the hotel rooms are quieter but an apartment for £300 with the noise outside is definitely not worth the stay .",3,2023,07,17
235,Mixed thoughts on this one.,"A case of mixed thoughts on this one. 
Staff extremely friendly *****
Rooms warm and cozy *****

Here's why I dropped a few stars. I was charged for parking the first stay... and not the second.. both the same package so that confused me despite my colleagues saying they never paid for parking.

On both occasions I stayed when I went for dinner ( which was included) it seemed to cause massive confusion and embarrassment for me.

Food is good but the Lamb stew is served in a bowl other hotels would give you your veg in. It was greasy too and not worth €17. It literally had half a spud.. half a carrot and a bit of lamb. Extremely disappointing. Don't like negatively reviewing places but those last few points definitely put a damper on my stay.",3,2023,07,15
235,A GOOD NIGHT BEFORE A FLIGHT!,"We had an excellent nights stay with 14 days parking at the Metro Hotel before flying out of Dublin. The family room is excellent with a separate room for kids. We had a nice meal in the bar, with reasonable prices and excellent Guinness. The shuttle to and from the airport is quick and the departure and pick up times were on time. We will certainly use again if we are on an early flight. ",5,2023,07,14
235,"Everything looked great, but lacking some key things","The apartment was modern and beautifully decorated. The restaurant was delicious and convenient, and the shuttle timely. Even after maintenance came up, we never had hot water. The doors between rooms were very heavy and loud. ",3,2023,07,13
235,Don’t plan on a hot shower but the shuttle service was reliable ,"No hot water. The hot water is on a timer which is adjustable, we attempted to change it but it wouldn’t respond. We called the front desk because it wasn’t working and they sent someone up. He didn’t know how to work it either.  And that was the end of it.  He just left and shrugged his shoulders.  I called the front desk again but they offered no further solutions. I’ve never stayed at a hotel that was so dismissive about a problem. The shuttle service to the airport was reliable.  ",2,2023,07,04
235,"Alicia delivered ""Exceptional"" customer service!!","Alicia checked us in quickly and in a very efficient manner. When I mentioned I needed to buy an important medical device, she gladly offered to drive us downtown after her shift.  She spent alot of her free time, with a smile, driving to a couple of stores until we found the much need item, thanks to her generous help.
She is a great example of Irish hospitality .",5,2023,07,01
235,"I recommend this hotel - clean, convenient and hassle free. Just what we needed","Stayed one night before flying out. Everything was clean and perfect for what we wanted. The rooms were clean and spacious. We could open the windows to let the air from outside in, the mattress was comfortable. Highly recommended ",5,2023,06,27
235,The early bird,"Conviently located close to the airport with a shuttle starting at 4 am, and a lovely restaurant/bar, the metro hotel is ideal should you need a room for an eartly flight.
Reception staff and waiters pleasant and helpful.
Clean and nice room!",5,2023,06,20
235,Subpar experience. Dirty sheets. Sketchy neighborhood. Rude manager. ,"The sheets were clearly dirty and slept in. The shower was also dirty. This is what is known in real estate as “a lipstick on a pig” hotel. Baseboards were beat up, bathroom door was water damaged.  Not what you would expect for 350 Euro per night. The local driver who dropped me off warned me about the neighborhood. Food was mediocre; after spending 10 days in Ireland, the food at every bed and breakfast and cafe was better than here which is certainly not what I expected based on photos and price. The wait staff was friendly and were the best part of my stay. Luiz on the other hand was very rude upon checkout when I asked for a receipt, which is very standard and guests are usually asked if they would like one. I wasn’t asked and was given attitude with him stating I should’ve asked sooner. We’re 30 seconds into checkout and it’s my responsibility to ask for that immediately? If he treats guests like that, I hate to see how he treats staff. ",1,2023,06,18
235,overnight stay near dublin airport,"stayed overnight on the 3rd of june 2023
close to dublin airport
excellent room
quiet location
difficult to find parking
pleasant staff
jak in the kitchen was helpful
although kitchen was shut by the time i checked in ( 10pm ) he directed me to a nearby chipper for a pizza & chips ( 2 min away )
overall very good hotel",4,2023,06,09
235,Great girly night with my daughter,Great hotel food fab staff very helpful kind and caring and a great help only thing is shower door bit tight for large women as myself but clean room and we both loved it as was nice time together  before her dance comp ,5,2023,06,04
235,"Great hotel, great customer service","Had a great stay at Metro Hotel before an early morning flight. The price & value was excellent compared to other Dublin hotels at the moment, especially if you factor in the free airport shuttle. Alisha at the front desk was extremely friendly, helpful & professional. From when I rang to enquire about early check in, to when I showed up at the hotel & again when I left the next morning every interaction I had with Alisha was top class customer service! ",5,2023,06,02
235,Metro Dublin - a place of luxury and connivence. ,"This hotel is amazing, and I would recommend staying here, especially if you are going to Dublin City. The staff are very accommodating, the interior is modern, and the restaurant serves great food. While accommodation prices in Dublin are a bit high at the moment, the Metro presents value for money. Rooms are clean and tidy, there are secure parking facilities for guests (€5 a night) and the bus routes to the city are right on your door step. The hotel provides a shuttle bus to Dublin Airport (€5 return tip per passenger), which is very cheap. Enjoy a luxury stay at the door steps of the city.",5,2023,05,25
235,Metro Dublin Hotel is a Great Place to Stay,"Excellent Room, clean and very quiet. The front desk agent (Leisha I think was her name) was friendly and help us get an early check in.  Location is awesome, close to the airport (Free Shuttle Included) and to the buses.  Will stay again next time.",5,2023,05,24
235,Excellent,Absolutely excellent place to stay even though it was only for one night prior to flying out to Spain. Booking was simple and regular emails prior to arrival. The room was first class and bar food was exceptional. Courtesy bus to airport. An altogether excellent stay,5,2023,05,23
235,Ugly location sorrunded by yonkis and scumbags.,"Located in Ballymun,one of the worst areas of North Dublin. Ugly location sorrounded by yonkis and scumbags. Not even the car park is safe. Avoid this place. Plenty of nicer hotels in better areas closer to the city or with beautiful sorroundings ( any area is better , believe me). Do not waste your money, stay away from this hotel and this location . ",1,2023,05,09
235,Amazing service by Danijel.,Amazing service . We were well looked by the Manager Danijel . He suggested a few things that we should try and everything that he suggested was very tasty . He is really amazing. Very attentive to details and made us feel very comfortable and made our evening special.,5,2023,05,05
235,Don't be put off by what people tell you,"I booked 2 rooms at the metro for my self and my son as we were going for just one night to Northside for a funeral. When I told the family they said we should cancel as it was not a place we should stay. But we kept our booking and I am glad we did.
The room was great comfy bed ,all amenities and very clean and free shuttle to the airport,also pleasant helpful staff what more do you want?
Now the area may not be where you would wander round at night but if you are looking a value for money stay near the airport then it's ideal. Restaurant looked nice but we did not try try it. Would use again",5,2023,05,04
235,Brilliant hotel on Dublin business trip,"Zipped into Dublin for a business meeting and overnighted at this really great hotel. The unit I stayed in was really comfortable, spacey and the bedroom was excellent and comfortable. The breakfast was great and waitron Simona so very positive, engaging and helpful. The front desk staff were so welcoming and a special mention for Alisha, who was wonderfully customer centric and most helpful. I shall certainly stay here again!",5,2023,05,04
235,Comfortable Stay and close to the Airport,"We enjoyed our stay at the Metro hotel. The only issues we experienced were with our keys not working properly, we had to go back to reception a few times to get our keys reset as they would not work in the lift or at the door. We also at dinner in the restaurant twice and the first night our waiter seemed to forget about us and after seating us didn't come back to take our order for over 40 mins. but over all we were very happy with our stay. We stayed in the apartments ( 2 bedroom on the 12th floor) and were very happy with the accommodations, we had a great view of Dublin.  Even with the mishap with our first night in the restaurant, the quality of the food received in the restaurant was wonderful. We would recommend to others  and a stay here again.",4,2023,03,29
235,Exceeded our expectations too ! ,"Very pleasant stay here. Shuttle easy to find I advertised on website and easy to find at airport. Friendly driver who took us to hotel. Check in easy. No frills hotel in lobby area. 
Room was great. There was two of us and got a a two room, room. King size bedroom and bunk beds in other room which we didn’t need but used to put luggage in etc. lovely and clean and modern. Couldn’t fault it. 
Bathroom great. Lovely looking. Shower really powerful. Had rainfall part in shower. This didn’t work as broken but overall bathroom great. Nice a warm room. Too warm. Had to turn heater off in room but not a problem. Lovely sleep. Bed comfy. 
Overall great. Wish we stayed here the second night rather than where we ended up !!! 
",4,2023,03,25
235,Very happy,"I thought this was a super hotel for a stay before travelling to Dublin airport. 
The car parking felt very easy and secure and we were happy to leave it for the duration of our holiday.
At check in although we arrived at 3pm which is check in time, the room wasn't ready however, they offered another room that was ready so we didn't have to wait. The room was great, a little noisy for us being next to a main road and dirt bike track but we live in the countryside so not used to it. 
We ate in the bar in the evening and had a super meal. 
We used the airport shuttle to the airport and it arrived as booked and the friendly driver delivered us to the airport within a few minutes. When we arrived back the shuttle was on a break so after a phone call, other arrangements where easily made which was great, 
Overall we were very happy with the hotel, service and price and would stay again for sure.
",5,2023,03,07
235,Love this place ,"I love this hotel! The parking facilities are safe and secure, the staff are absolutely lovely, the bar food and pints are delicious, the room was beautifully decorated and large, the place was spotless, a massive bathroom with loads of hot water, the bed was massive and comfy and they have MUGS for coffee!! Will 100% stay here again ",5,2023,02,28
235,Located next to crack house,"This hotel is located no where near the airport and is in fact next to a crack house, people in their jarmas roaming around at all times of day. Staff leave room service food in the landing for days at a time. They offer a free shuttle bus however will not inform you of this, would rather allow you to pay for your own airport taxi. I’m currently dealing with “Kati” the rather unhelpful and rude manager as days after my stay she’s decided to hold an unauthorised payment of nearly £300 and is unwilling to explain why. Avoid at al costs.",1,2023,02,15
235,Average stay,"Close to the airport and staff/shuttle bus drivers very pleasant. Bed was not comfortable and room was cold. I tried many times throughout the night to put the temperature up but it kept resetting back to what it was, resulting in a terrible nights sleep. We had time to waste in the afternoon before our shuttle bus to the airport so decided to have some lunch in the restaurant which was definitely below average! Not worth the money for what you get. Overall it’s a handy place if you have a flight and need somewhere to stay.",3,2023,01,25
235,It Far Exceeded our Expectations!,"This hotel far exceeded my expectations. We were in Dublin for a swim meet at the NAC - only a 12 min drive from the hotel. 
The corridors were gloomy grey and the doors and woodwork was an uninviting chipped black - I assumed the rooms would have a similar feel. 
I’m happy to say this theme did not continue into the rooms. Our room on the first floor was great, fresh and spotless. The bed linen was clean and of a good quality. The beds were comfortable. The modern bathroom had a walk-in shower. There was a desk with a coffee station and a separate table area. The room was the perfect temperature and it was quiet which meant we had a good sleep on both nights. Parking was also provided by the hotel

Mark Williams, the hotel manager, must be excellent at what he does because his team was just fabulous. All the staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and professional, but three people stood out from the rest. 
*David, the night time security man, was so kind and polite. He helped us find parking space s and helped me get the lift moving after losing my room 
card. 
*Celia and Cynthia in the breakfast room. Cynthia is the Chef (a fantastic one!) - she made the most delicious fresh breakfasts and Celia was our friendly, bubbly and accommodating Waitron. 
David, Celia and Cynthia are wonderful ambassadors for your hotel!
I’d also like to extend a thank you to the house keeping team - our room was a very welcome site after long, hot days at the NAC. 
Thank you for a great stay.",5,2023,01,22
235,Great hotel,"Wonderfully located hotel only a short drive from Dublin Airport. We stayed here two nights recently before a day trip to Lapland. Check in was smooth, the receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful. The family room was fantastic, two separate bedrooms, one with bunks plus a large bedroom with a comfortable king sized bed. The room had city views but was a bit noisy when the traffic started up in the morning. 

We availed of the free shuttle to the airport at 4.30am but we missed the last shuttle (1045pm) as our return flight was delayed. 

The food in the restaurant was excellent, reasonably priced and extremely tasty. Portions weren’t huge but we all enjoyed. 

The location is perfect for travelling out of Dublin airport and covered parking is offered. We will definitely return here again if flying from Dublin. 

Many thanks!",5,2022,12,23
235,Very pleasant stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at Metro Hotel Dublin. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Everything was made comfortable for us from the very beginning - hotel shuttle bus (with a very helpful driver Luigi) picked us up from the airport. 

We stayed in the apartment on the 14th floor and the view from there was amazing. Rooms were clean and modern. 

Breakfasts were tasty and staff there was very polite. I would especially like to thank Simona, who was very nice and fulfilled all our wishes with a smile on her face. 
Evening coctails at the bar and dinner at the restaurant were also really good! 

For me, the whole stay was pleasant and I can only say good things about the hotel itself and its staff!",5,2022,12,07
235,Best in Dublin,"The best stay in my life! 

Comfortable and on time shuttle bus to and from the airport. Great drivers, especially Luigi! 

Close to everything we needed. Reception staff was lovely, so friendly.  We stayed in the apartement, the view was absolutely gorgeous. Rooms were comfy and beds...i didnt even want to get up. Everything you needed was there or was delivered to you in no time. 

Breakfast was good, special thanks to Simona who made sure that we had everything. Shes a happy hardworking girl! Bar staff in the evening was nice and frieldy, very accommodating. Therefore special thanks to always smiley Daniel! 

We will be back! ",5,2022,12,06
235,Ideal for a short stopover,"Stayed here for business early November 2022. Located about 15 minutes drive from the airport, this is an ideal stopver before a flight. The receptionist was very welcoming, the bar and waiting staff were pleasant and the food in the bar was very good, (Pub grub). There was a complimentary shuttle to the airport which was dead handy at 5am!!",5,2022,11,14
235,Book through the Metro Hotel directly!,"We stayed here for 6 nights and we loved it. The staff was very knowledgeable, helpful and extremely friendly. The shuttle bus provided to and from the Dublin Airport was extremely helpful. We enjoyed the hotel restaurant and the staff there as well. The food was good. ",5,2022,11,12
235,Reaching For The Stars!,"Back Again! 

Returned to this hotel again almost to the Date from last year as part of the Organising team for The All Ireland University Hockey Championships which took place in Trinity Sports Grounds, 100 metres from the Hotel. Arrived early and to my surprise my room was ready upon arrival, so I planned to dump some of my bags in the room before heading off. 

Now Folks I booked an Apartment based on some incredible reviews off many sites and let me tell you when the receptionist said your on the 15th Floor I almost fell over. I asked almost in disbelief, ""Is that the Top Floor"", to which she said it was!]

Folks you truly do have to appreciate the views when you get up there, the minute I stepped off the elevator and was hit by a glare of sunlight I was very excited by what was in prospect! The Room was huge, 2 bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen and living area along with a huge balcony with quite a jaw DROPPING view of Dublin city! Honestly if you were looking at going anywhere for New Years Eve I would put in your request early for Room 1501 because the firework display you'd get wouldn't be beaten! 

Breakfast was good, with a huge selection of buffet, off the menu items, and continental choices. One comment as a fellow hotel worker though was I did think it was quite expensive for what you get but extremely tasty none the less and fills you up for the day. 

But for all the positives I'm giving the hotel room and food the real heros of this place are the Staff, particularly the Front Of House Staff. There was one issue with my room throughout the weekend, they tried numerous times to fix it, however I was compensated for it and I felt the way it was handled was excellent. I'd like to thank the Night Manager lady for the help with printing in the early hours of the morning, Federica for her professionalism throughout, and one lady I really want to highlight is Aine, from day 1 when I booked the rooms a Month prior she was the one I really found myself asking for the whole time to get things done. 

Guys the only reason its not 5 star is that one issue. This is my third time to stay in the Hotel and it won't be my last! A true team of Professionals! Thanks Again Guys!",4,2022,11,02
235,An not-too-expensive Dublin gem,"I was here for a night in the city. The location is optimal. Granted, it's not in the city centre but there are close bus stops that would take you there in half an hour. The entrance is very low key. The bar and restaurant are very well looked-after and the rooms are super nice and clean. The staff was accommodating and polite. They also run a shuttle service to and from the airport every 15 mins. Would reccomend and come back.",5,2022,10,27
235,Excellent stay,"Arrived in Dublin for an overnight layover. I found this hotel through a Google search, but when I visited the hotel's website directly, I discovered some really good deals if you book through them and not a third-party service. I ended up with a comfortable room on the first floor (that's the second floor to my fellow Americans) that was very clean and well appointed. Staff was very courteous and helpful and the continental breakfast was very good with lots of fresh choices. The airport shuttle was not running due to maintenance issues, but the hotel paid for a cab in the morning. I only had to notify them when I checked in that I needed a ride.

This hotel is between the hotel and Dublin proper and made for a quick journey to and from the airport when I was tired at night and trying to keep on schedule the next morning. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,10,22
235,Great service,Stayed here for a night as we had an early flight the next morning. Staff couldn’t be more helpful as I had booked a day later than was needed only realising this upon check in. This was no issue as they had rooms available and brought the booking forward at no cost. The transfer to and from the airport was great and reliable unlike other hotels,5,2022,10,16
235,Nice airport hotel,"So we stayed somewhere else in Dublin at the beginning of our trip, then traveled around and stayed here on our last night before our flight home. The hotel was very close to the airport, and the free shuttle was great! The room was nice- almost too modern as I had trouble with all the light switches and actually had to have someone tell me how to turn on the blow dryer (it was plugged in through a drawer and the button to turn it on was red and on the wall so it did not look like the right button to push). Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was small but good enough.
We ate dinner there - and were hungry after a day of travel. The man seating us seemed to want to seat us in the bar area at a very small coffee table and I objected due to its height and how we would eat. From then on we were kind of treated not so great. It was odd. The food was good but we were never checked on and I had to ask for the check twice. It was like we didn't have a true dedicated wait person, just staff members. I asked if I could put it on my room but he said it was too late. 
Lastly, we were awakened very early that morning to hotel construction going on literally right outside our door. Loud banging, hammering, not cool. I mentioned it upon checkout and was told it was last minute, but was it really? How last min could it have been when they had drywall/sheetrock - why not just put us on another floor at checkin?
I would recommend staying here anyway - nice place, even with the bumps. My review sounds harsh and I sound picky but there were just several odd things in a row.",4,2022,10,10
235,Good rooms but would avoid the restaurant.,"Had a 1 day stopover in this hotel. The rooms are nice but the restaurant was terrible. The admin of the restaurant was barking at us same as to the staff while giving them orders, which made the atmosphere so tense. I would avoid the restaurant.",2,2022,10,10
235,Very disappointed about the restaurant,"The room was nice and clean for staying one night, but the restaurant was horrible. The foods were disgusting. The breakfast was cold and didn’t taste good either. It took about 15mins to be served tea and coffee. The fish & chips and vegetables stir fry were really disappointed .",2,2022,10,08
235,"Excellent, considerate service from kind-hearted staff","I had a late stopover in between flights into and out of Dublin airport. I found the Metro Hotel staff, particularly Mary and David, extremely helpful and considerate despite the high volume of guests entering the hotel at the same time I arrived. It made this part of a demanding journey home far easier than it would otherwise have been.",5,2022,09,25
235,Staging for next day flight,"We can’t say enough about our stay at this hotel. Our room was ready when we arrived. When asking for suggestions on what to do in the area, in the way of food, great suggestions were provided along with a map as we were walking. I wish I could recall the woman’s name who worked at the front desk, but she was a catalyst with the information along with a pleasant smile and a great laugh!
We will definitely use the Metro Jotel for our future stays.",5,2022,09,24
235,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for one night last weekend to attend the Garth Brooks concert. We wanted something close to public transport and not too far from the hotel which this was. The hotel was lovely, so nicely decorated and very clean. The rooms were very comfortable and cosy and we had a great view. The staff were very helpful, polite and friendly. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was really nice and you could tell it was freshly made too!
They also offer a shuttle bus to and from the airport.
I’d really recommend staying here if you’re in Dublin. It’s probably about ten minutes away from the centre by bus and public transport is really good.",5,2022,09,13
235,Over night stay,"Stay away...such a bad hotel...really rude service, facilities so bad, to be fair the rooms  are ok, but the staff sate so under  experienced, no hospitality  at all this hotel is possibly the worst one we have ever stayed in....feels like a stop over with no services..",1,2022,09,11
235,Nice Rooms,"Stayed here for one night. We arrived in Dublin airport and got the courtesy bus which took about 10-15 mins, There is nothing around the hotel in the way of entertainment or shops. The bar was not a great experience. The staff were all over the place, it was very Faulty Towers like. Check in was easy and the room was lovely, clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was very good with a decent shower in it. We slept well and the fact the hotel is on a busy junction , we didn't hear a thing throughout the night.
Overall we were happy with our stay, I would describe the hotel as functional and a little over priced.",4,2022,09,11
235,Simply Fabulous,"A very warm and friendly welcome. An unexpected upgrade. The room was fabulous.
The public areas are really lovely, well maintained with a modern feel.
The restaurant was very good, kind staff. The breakfast was great.
I’ll certainly make this hotel my go to when next in Dublin.",5,2022,08,24
235,Beautiful Hotel,Fabulously comfy hotel and lovely staff. Maybe not so much the suit who ran the bar that addressed us like the staff he was barking orders to. We found it an uncomfortable atmosphere in the bar because of his attitude to us and his staff,4,2022,08,23
235,Does the job 👍,"Stayed for a night to be close to the airport for a early morning flight. It’s very convenient distance to the airport and I believe it has a free shuttle bus ( we drove so I didn’t use it ). My partner booked a suite room with a kitchen unit. The room itself look lovely and modern at first glance. I really liked the lay out but when I went in there were marks everywhere on the walls, a stain on the coach and splashes of something on one of the walls. It definitely could have been cleaner. However the bed itself was spotless and the bathroom was clean too. I would have expected cleaner for the price payed. 

The receptionist was polite and friendly when we checked in and out. The door has a buzzer so reception have to let you in. I thought this was good for safety. The hotels car park is underground  and was only accessible with a key. 

All in all, it was a pretty good stay with small  things.",3,2022,08,21
235,Airport hotel with free shuttle,Nice hotel for being close to the airport. Free shuttle was a major selling point. They provided a child cot but it wasn’t set up when we arrived as promised. Service was very quick and the food was good if a bit pricey (there are no other nearby restaurants). This was a comfortable airport hotel.,4,2022,08,20
235,Airport hotel stay,We stayed there August 7 before a flight . Got free shuttle to and from airport from hotel . Driver very friendly. Lovely welcome by staff at reception . Staff member carried our luggage to room . Got bar food that nite . All good and again bar staff lovely . Paid extra for breakfast . Value for money . Cost 148 euro for 2 and this was ok considering g the exorbitant prices of Dublin hotels this summer . Hotel decor lovely . Will be back . Naomi Galway,5,2022,08,17
235,One night with car park,"In these days of ridiculous hotel prices it was a pleasant surprise to pay 180 euro for a one night stay including 2 nights carparking and free shuttle bus to and from the airport.
The other pleasant surprise was that the bar food was very nice,  the room was of an excellent standard and the staff were friendly,  professional  and helpful.
If I'm forced to fly from Dublin again,  the existence of the excellent Metro Hotel will at least take some of the sting out of it!

235,"The start was great, but not so good as it went on.","On arrival it was great.  But unfortunately we were unable to get into the lounge for dinner. The option given was room service or a two course meal to eat in the restaurant.  Not practical with 3 young children. The lounge manager was extremely rude. 
We had no choice to order room service.  So we ended up waiting over one hour for the food, and it was freezing. The children’s nuggets were burnt and couldn’t be eaten. Very disappointed, as we had sent a review to the hotel and still nothing back from them. 
After returning from our holiday. There was no courtesy bus and I had to contact reception to be told to get a taxi and it would be refunded. Our car seats were in the hotel, so they needed collected. It was a nightmare. We got one family away and the rest had to walk back to the other terminal. We also had a young girl in a wheelchair. The total of 2 hours to be leaving with our car.  Not acceptable.  I called several times and tbh no one knew what was happening.  
I emailed the next day and still waiting on a response…
The rooms are spotless and hotel is lovely. Reception staff are lovely. 
So disappointed with management.",3,2022,08,12
235,"I felt it to be an exercise in ""how much can we charge while giving our guest not much at all?""","I occupied a ""double room for single occupancy"". It was a very good thing there was only me in it because with the chair provided jammed between the bed and the window there would have been no space at all to get out of the bed on the window side and there was no space to move the chair to had there been a need to.

I have an ensuite at home that is almost as big as this room.

I was charged €277 for it for one night and no breakfast. I was somewhat annoyed to see it advertised on Booking.com for €160 the night I stayed there. Good old Rip-Off Ireland again. So much for being cheaper to book direct with the hotel too.

The bed sheet had two holes in it. The towels were thin and frayed and the extractor vent in the bathroom was filthy with accumulated dust that would have been very easy to remove with the vacuum cleaner had the maid just bothered to look up. ( I have uploaded the photos )

The toilet roll holder was broken. It was hanging off the wall and unusable. Therefore had to put the toilet roll on the basin unit. That made reaching it bordering on painful due to the contortion required to reach it.

The service in the restaurant was good and the Irish female server very pleasant. She was perhaps the nicest thing I could say about the hotel personally. The food was fine. Not what you'd call ""memorable"" but perfectly adequate. I thought €9.50 for a glass of NZ Sauvignon Blanc was extremely cheeky. Can buy the whole bottle for less than that in many supermarkets as we know. €6-7 fair enough, but €9.50? Come off it! This was not Cloudy Bay.  

I wont be going back to this hotel. I am fortunate enough that I can afford to pay €9.50 for a glass of wine if I choose to but no one likes to feel ripped off. Value counts at every level. Doesn't matter if you are spending €10, €1k or €10k you still want to feel like you received value for your money and in this case I didn't feel that at all. Just felt like I was being milked.

I also requested a quiet room and there was a busy road right outside the window.
 
I have another trip to make to Dublin soon and already booked a better quality hotel with more facilities and more space for €146.  

Last point and this is not for the hotel so much as for Americans who might be reading this. At 5 am a door close by went BANG. A moment later BANG again. Then two American voices from a couple walking down the hall, talking very loudly while they were standing waiting for the lift, which was also very near my room. 
Why must Americans speak so loudly and allow doors to slam? At 5am would it really be too much to ask for a little commonsense and for consideration of fellow guests trying to stay asleep??!!?? Maybe the hotel could put signs up asking people arriving late or leaving early to be a bit considerate and quiet. Would that be such a big ask?",2,2022,07,21
235,"Nice Hotel, Terrible parking","the property itself is fine and the rooms are nice with decent bathrooms and beds

Disliked  · the main issue is the mess which is the parking. when you arrive you need to:  check in get a key go back to your car 
drive round to the car park 
get out to scan the key 
get back in to drive into the car park (you can’t park here as it’s for the surrounding apartments. 
then you need to go to underground car parks which again require you to scan in.
the car parks are tiny with very little room.  once in and Parked you need to then  scan out the underground  (no clear pedestrian exit).
walk through the upper car park scan out of that gate
 go back to the hotel and head to your room.  

this becomes a real issue if you’re able to get into the apartment car parking without a pass and become stuck as we did.  

meaning we had to wait for someone to come in to let us out to go through the process again which after a flight and approaching midnight, no one wants to do

Would have been 4 stars but really the parking was a Massive pain",3,2022,07,20
235,Great food at the restaurant:  Thanks Chef Sam!,"We were forced into an overnight by a cancelled flight and booked online, so we had no idea what we were getting.     The shuttle was right on time and the driver (Luigi)  was great.  IIt is only a few miles away but a 15 minute drive due to traffic and the winding path.  We were a little nervous when we pulled up as the neighborhood does not seem to be the best but we actually went for a really  lovely walk in a park (Santry Park?) just down the road.   The room was clean and the shower was great.   The restaurant downstairs was VERY good (Thanks Chef Sam) and the service (Patricjk and company) were very attentive and friendly.   We really enjoyed the lamb stew, fish and chips, and seafood chowder.    These dishes were REALLY good and we were just so surprised that a motel restaurant had such nice food.   We also like the varied seating arrangements, lots of choices.",4,2022,07,12
235,Metro Hotel Dublin Airport Apartment stay,"We stayed in one of the Metro Apartments for several days.  A beautiful view, and the hotel service was professional. We had no hot water in our apartment for the first day & a half, although they did try to fix it.  The problem was finally resolved and they kindly compensated us for the inconvenience. We enjoyed delicious dinners  with friendly wait staff.  Amanda and Dan were great!",4,2022,07,09
235,"Great Location for Airport, with Parking","Booked this hotel as we were able to park our car for 5 days whilst we travelled to NY. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. Only stayed 1 night, ate at the restaurant which was very good. Free shuttle to airport and back again on our return. Will definitely stay again if flying from Dublin. Really convenient, with no stress before our flight.",5,2022,07,08
235,Rude driver shuttle bus service. ,The shuttle bus service is a joke! The driver is aggressive and rude.  Late service. Lie about us missing the bus when we waited over an hour and 20 minutes. No cead mile failte in Dublin. Fly from Shannon ir Cork where people are more considerate,1,2022,07,02
235,First Nights in Dublin,"I choice this place for the proximity to the airport. Before my check in, I made sure my partner would be able to check in before me because I was still en route to Ireland. Tara made sure everything was ready for him to get into my room without any issues due to me not being present and him not having my credit card. Once I did get to the hotel, it was a pleasant stay. The restaurant was great as well and our server, Smit, was excellent. Our only complaint was breakfast was not brought to our room. We left the breakfast card with our preferred choices on our door around 1am (the card states to put it outside by 6am) and we never got anything delivered at the designated time.  This wasn't a huge deal but we were looking forward to their breakfast. Tara giving us a late check out made up for this small oversight and we'll be staying again. ",4,2022,06,21
235,"Good, quiet hotel close to airport","We stayed 2 nights after moving from all the noise and activity of city centre Dublin. The accommodations were very nice. The room was small and we were well pleased with all the electrical outlets. The bathroom was clean and well supplied.  The front desk clerks were pleasant and professional explaining the cleaning routine. Tomasz, the porter, was wonderful helping us to our room. We ate dinner both nights of our stay at the hotel because of convenience  also because the food was decent. Smit was our waiter both nights. Again, couldn't ask for a more attentive person. We actually enjoyed the fact that the bar and dining area are for guests only. After several days and nights in Dublin City Centre it was nice to have quiet dining! Only had breakfast one morning. It was delicious with plenty of variety and wonderful staff. We signed up and used the airport shuttle our last morning. Worked flawlessly! Only issue was I asked and was told I could pay for the second night of our stay the morning we checked out with cash. When I went to use the euros I had left over from our trip I was informed the room had already been billed to my credit card and it wasn't going to be changed.",5,2022,06,19
235,Ideal for airport stays,"Stayed for one night, arrived around 9pm into Dublin airport and got shuttle to hotel.  Shuttle service is ideal.  Had a few drinks at the bar after checking in.  Only residents are allowed into the bar.  Room was good, very clean and had everything we needed.  We got a great sleep, didn’t hear a thing during the night.  Breakfast in the morning was lovely, the menu is very varied & good selection.  Tea & coffee service was very slow though even though there weren’t many people there but the food was nice. A good experience and we would stay again.",4,2022,06,11
235,Traumatic experience,"On the 1st of May, I stayed in this hotel, on my own, prior to travelling on my own to Canada the following morning. I was horrendously woken up to an aggressive man forcing himself into my room. If it wasn’t for my extra key lock on, he would have entered my room with a room key that reception gave him. I understand mistakes happen, but for this horrible experience to happen to a 24 year old woman is just not on. This man was aggressive and kept opening my door and not taking no for an answer. The receptionist did not make a big deal about this when I rang, and at check out told me to ‘please don’t leave a bad review’… I really don’t think anyone realises how traumatic my stay here at the metro was, and word of advice for everyone, always put on the extra security lock on your door.",1,2022,05,11
235,Just don't stay here,"My family and I booked the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport for the end of our stay in Ireland. We stayed at a variety of places all over the country from lodges to motels to bed and breakfasts, and this experience was by far the worst of them. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk (Amanda) refused to split our rooms between our credit cards as we requested. When we went up to our room, one of the doors was  unlocked and open, meaning that anyone could have entered the room at any time. Later, we asked if we would be able to put more space between the twin beds in one of the rooms. Mary at the front desk offered to help us, but Amanda stepped in and refused, and was very unkind about it. Amanda was either having an off day, or has no business working in customer service. Mary was fantastic throughout our stay, and is very suited to this job. Additionally, the hotel is in a VERY BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. They have to lock the sliding doors leading to the entrance, and our taxi driver told us in no uncertain terms to never leave the hotel on foot. We had one dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was TERRIBLE. The pizza was horrible, and the service was not much better. The server seemed to have no experience whatsoever, and forgot several dishes of the diners around us and still tried to charge them for those items. Another issue was the fire doors, which are prone to slamming, and one of which was right outside our door and disrupted our sleep a lot. One good thing about the hotel was the convenient airport shuttle, and the wine selection was nice at the bar.",1,2022,05,05
235,Excellent hotel!,"It was last minute and I was able to get a room. Rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant had delicious food both for dinner and breakfast. My only regret was not knowing to ask for a room off the main road. It was a bit noisy with traffic. Otherwise a fantastic stay! Highly recommend.",4,2022,05,03
235,Dublin weekend was amazing,"Very friendly staff excellent customer service nothing was too much trouble for them 
Room was spacious and clean 
Good food breakfast was very good good selection and chef was happy to cook most things you wanted 
Thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone going for a weekend break",5,2022,04,26
235,Worth it for the airport and parking ,"Stayed here for 2 nights while away on holidays. I originally booked due to being able to park my car there for the duration. Rate was good.

We arrived late afternoon and left early morning. Reception booked a taxi for us to get to the airport as we were too late for the shuttle bus. Our car was safe in the underground car park.

The hotel requires your key card to access the lift, which is a good idea. 

Room was fine. 

Stayed again the night we returned.

Unfortunately we again arrived back too late for the shuttle bus so had to taxi again. It's a pity the shuttle does not run 24 hours, as we saw 2 other taxis also dropping people off. It's all extra money people could avoid having to pay if the bus had been available.

I would still recommend if you are flying from Dublin airport.",4,2022,04,22
235,Would highly recommend,"We stayed in this hotel for one night before traveling from Dublin airport. I found the staff to be very friendly and the room was fantastic for families with kids. Our family had two bedrooms, and the kids had their own bunk beds in their room. I was under pressure at 6 am the next morning to get all the kids bags and car seats etc down to the lobby to catch the shuttle to airport. Both a staff member and bus driver helped load all bags in and then helped me unload them all at the airport. It was a big help when under time pressure to catch a flight. I would definitely stay here again, considering parking at Dublin airport would have cost well over 100 and this was 200 for the room and parking also along with free shuttle.",5,2022,04,16
235,Ideal for Santry  sports clinic,"We have stayed at number of hotels close to Dublin Airport this was our first time here. My husband was  being admitted for surgery in Santry sports clinic on the Saturday morning and this hotel is perfect walking distance to hospital. As I was there alone on the Saturday night I was really happy with the level of security room key to access lift and resident only bar and restaurant you need to be buzzed in to reception.We had dinner in the bar it was good the little girl that serves us was lovely over all the staff are very friendly.the only issue is that the rooms are not serviced apparently still due to Covid that being the case they should leave adequate supplies of milk paper cups toilet rolls and towels as I had to ask receptionist for them.
The servicing of rooms seems to be dependent on the hotel chain as others to service the room. Overall I would recommend this hotel and we plan to stay here again prior to a flight. The rooms are spacious and had walk in shower which we really appreciated.
There is a shopping precinct close by Lidl spar Homebase you can pick up what you need a fridge would have been ideal for my stay the bar staff were super helpful when I asked for ice.",4,2022,03,30
235,Nice experience,Very welcoming staff at reception. The room was clean and tidy. I ordered room services and the food was really very nice. I booked park and fly and the area were I could park my car is very safe. The shuttle bus was on time and the driver was also very nice.,5,2022,03,04
235,Avoid at all cost,"Terrible service, waiting for 1h 31m to be checked in, after waiting for that long, been given a room that wasn't even ready, cleaner was still in the room cleaning and been told the room will not be ready for at least another 30 min. Rooms been mixed up multiple times, door cards weren't working twice!!!!!  bathrooms dirty, dust all over the place. After getting into the room, door lock was broken!!! The breakfast is so bland, food barely warm. An african cook behind the counter refused to serve english breakfast because no mask was on, even though he's been told that i can't use mask because I'm exempt. The manager had to be involved, where she served the breakfast for us. Overall the hotel is nice and modern, but the staff is so unprofessional, rude and most of them have no clue what they're at. The only staff that was professional was Elena(bar staff) she's full of passion towards work, warm and welcoming. Need more staff like her as the rest of the staff just putting the whole hotel down. Thank god i only stayed for 1 night. If you are looking for a hotel to stay, then please choose somewhere else, as in this hotel, you will be disappointed, trust me.

235,Lovely staff but cold shower,"good location, easy to get here from the M50. Secure parking. Room was standard city centre sized and nicely furnished. Big screen TV. I thought the room was cool and it only barely warmed up during my stay. My only complaint was the the shower was very very cold... maybe there was some switch i should have turned on but i certainly couldnt find it!
I had my dinner in the bar, limited menu but the food was lovely. Staff there were very friendly. Also had breakfast there the following morning.",4,2022,01,11
235,Clean/ Comfortable and friendly helpful staff.,"A clean and comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful  staff , big thank you to the night porter who  came with us to help us find underground parking that night. Easy check in and check out. Price was very reasonable. Hotel within easy driving distance to Dublin port and airport.",5,2021,12,29
235,Over night stay before our flight from the airport,"From start to finish everyone was amazing to deal with. The family suite was amazing, so amazing teddy decided to stay on. The food and staff were fantastic in the bar. They chatted away to my 2 year old, got him a coffee biscuit before dinner and some colours to calm him. The breakfast staff were lovely too. The prices shocked me, they were so reasonable. And the hotel is only around the corner from the airport. Would highly recommend and will return.",5,2021,12,26
235,"Stay,Park and Fly","My husband and I stayed in the Metro Hotel near Dublin Airport as we were flying out to Lanzarote on an early flight and had to travel from Cork. The staff were very friendly, polite and very helpful with our check-in and parking of our car. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. We had food in the bar which was very nice. Would recommend staying here.",5,2021,12,08
235,Highly recommended,"Really impressed with the staff at this hotel. The receptionists and porters were so welcoming. A special mention to Tomasz, the porter, he was so helpful and amazing. Was so professional and knowledgeable about the area.
The room was spotless and comfortable. Would definitely recommend a stay here.",4,2021,11,25
235,Fabulous hotel,We stayed in this hotel on November 11th last before a trip to Spain we had trouble with our passenger locator form the girls in reception Samantha and Barbra went above and beyond to help us get the forms sorted. A big thank you to both girls. The bar and restaurant staff were very friendly and food was great. Rooms are are fabulous and very clean. They also provide a shuttle bus to and from the airport. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2021,11,15
235,Halloween Night,"The general opinion is good, but on Halloween night a group of people (with clear symptoms of having excess alcohol) were screaming, rioting and knocking on the doors of the rooms, all night. After calling reception several times, they did nothing to fix this problem. We couldn't sleep all night. That is intolerable in a hotel of its category.",3,2021,11,12
235,Major Let Down,"Stayed here on 31st October 2021 with a room also booked  for the 5th of November.  I had previously stayed here on two separate occasions with no problems.
However, my experience on the 31st was absolutely appalling.  
I was staying with my husband, both of retired.
Upon check-in we were asked for a €200 deposit  ""in case we thrashed"" the room.  When we queried this we were told that it was a new policy of the hotel.  We hesitantly offered to pay by Visa Debit but the receptionist said that they woukd only acept cash or a Credit Card.
Our room was clean, we ate in the restaurant and had some drinks in the bar.  From here on in the problems started in earnest.  There was a very large group of young people running riot around the hotel.  None of them wore masks or even shoes and contrary to current Government guidelines, they were served at the bar counter.
We spoke to a manager and discovered that this group had an entire two floors booked out for the purpose of Halloween parties.  We were informed that this is a regular occurrence.  When I asked if we were safe on one of these floors I was told that they had plenty of security on duty.  Shortly after, the manager approached us and said that they would strongly advise that we move floors and did provide another room.  However, the new room was filthy.  The bed and bathroom were fine but every surface was filthy.  I have photographs to back up my comments.
I brought my concerns to the receptionist on the following morning and cancelled my stay for the 5th.  She apologised and said that she would bring it to the attention of the manager.  To date we have had no reply from him.",1,2021,11,09
235,Best choice for full service,"Coach service from Dublin Airport to and from, welcoming staff and completely quiet location. 15mins. door to door. Reasonable but high end restaurant with proficient staff. Rooms are comfortable with full amenities provided for a longer stay. Will be using it again.",5,2021,11,07
235,Almost Perfect,"Stayed here last weekend as part of the Organisational panel of the All Ireland Intervarsity Hockey Championships held in Trinity Sports Grounds. I actually stayed here in 2016 so had high expectations. I arrived around lunch time and was given a warm check in by the Accommodation Manager of all people. When I got to my room, a Kings Suite, I was in in luxury. Massive King bed, small seating area, and kitchen, quite a small bathroom though. 

One small issue in the room, a lot of scuff marks all over the walls of the room. If it was just the skirting boards guys I probably wouldn't be overly critical but when its the walls and can be cleaned it shows a lack of care for the rooms. Overall the room coulda done with a bit more TLC. 

Dined in the restaurant on Friday night, having the Chicken burger which was very tasty, staff were very friendly and well trained. Breakfast was good, you can order a standard Irish Fry Up or from the menu. I tried both and again super tasty, especially the eggs benedict!

Guys Overall similiar to 2016 I can't the service of the Metro Hotel. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because the room needs a bit of TLC. Rest assured I'll be back again someday! 

Thanks Again Guys!",4,2021,10,27
235,Would definitely stay again,"We stayed the night before we travelled and parked the car here and I'd definitely use the hotel again.  Rooms were perfectly clean, bed comfortable, bar food and service really good and airport shuttle service excellent. The cost was also very reasonable.",5,2021,10,25
235,Rude Check Out,"We had an overnight stay for an early morning flight. Everything about the hotel, including the room and the bar, was top quality. Super friendly staff as well throughout the hotel except the night duty guy on reception. 

As we approached the desk to check out this morning a man in a funky 3 piece suit sitting at the desk just looked at us as if to say 'What?' No words were said. When I said ""Room 309 checking out"" he held his hand out and again said nothing. I handed him the card and again he just took it and put his head down and carried on doing whatever he was doing. Not one word did he speak. 

Remember when Ireland was known for its friendliness? Those were the days. I used to work in the hotel industry and if I was management at the Metro Hotel I'd be having a serious word with this guy. ",4,2021,10,23
235,9-10,"Have to say the hotel and the staff are 100% . Samantha at the desk was so lovely to work with and very clear with her communication. The restaurant staff that worked the evening shift where honestly so nice and fast with orders , drinks and food service I didn’t get the man & lady’s name that serviced us but they seemed to be very on the ball and good workers who made the dining experience a lot chiller ☺️ The room was very clean which is always great to see. 

The only issue we had was the breakfast, the man serving didn’t seem to be the nicest to the people staying this may have been due to stress as it seemed to be just him and a fella training who seemed very nervous but did a good job 👍🏽 but the man overlooking him kept us waiting 20 minutes to pay a bill while having a Q Of people at the door who he could of been friendlier to even if he was under pressure :( 

Over all id stay again due to how lovely the evening staff are and how nice the food is 🙏🏼",5,2021,08,22
235,Autism Friendly & Friendly Understanding Staff,"Our first trip overnight in a hotel for tayto park experience.  We were anxious as our 8 year old son has autism and a moderate intellectual disability non verbal.  He does his own thing which mens can be destructive and break things alot. On arrival the security guard made us so comfortable and shared his daughter was autistic.  Had trouble with elevator and he could see Jack was distressed but was so calm and talked to him to try help us.

Room for family with bunk beds was ideal! 

We were feeling brave and thought let's try eat in the bar and luckily it was very quiet. The staff couldn't do enough for us. Kind, understanding and no judgement.  We left the hotel feeling so proud of Jack for coping and thankful for the wonderful experience we encountered with the staff whose our stay so easy!

We will definitely be back.

235,Just perfect for my 3 weeks trip in Dublin,"I went 3 weeks in Dublin and slept there during all my trip. I strongly recommend this place !

- The staff is the best point of this hotel. Everybody was kind and nice especially Miss Samantha at the reception who was a big help for me during all the trip !

- The second best point for me was the Irish breakfast ! A traditional Irish breakfast with sausage, beans and all you need to start the day !

- The location was good. It’s very convenient to go to the city center ( bus 155 or 4 ) to go to the airport ( if you want take a flight or take a bus to the western coast for exemple ). You can also find lots place to buy what’s you need ( Lidl, Suoer Values etc,). Have also a park close the hotel. The Santry Park and a very nice coffee at 5 minutes by walk (Run Cafe)

- The room was good and very comfortable and clean.",5,2021,08,21
235,Poor hotel service,"Having arranged to stay at this hotel in June was quiet easy to book as I had an issue in Feb 2020 which due to Covid I couldn’t book until June of this year. 
Kati was quick and responsive throughout her emails with me. 
However, after arranging to stay here I received an email the day before to say that our room was not available and would be changed to another room because there was damage done to the room we were due to be in.
No bowls in our suite for breakfast(pointless) not spoons, having a suite was a waste.
As loyal customers we felt like nothing. 
Car park key wasn’t working and had to have security open it for me. Again, letting us down. 
Service is poor even from Kati the manager..
After deciding that we would book here again for our trip, the receptionist Samantha was so contradicting in giving me a price for the night. First €139 and then after I asked could a taxi be arranged she tried. Called me and advised it can’t be done the best she could do was give us 10% off which brought it to €143 and refused to go lower. 
I asked how is this when she had quoted me €139.
Was expecting a call from Gail this morning only to find out Kati was emailing me. Again poor customer service. 
Explained all this to Kati and she had zero interest in listening or shows no empathy to loyal customers. 
Since my last email, I’ve not had a response from Kati. 

Terrible way to treat loyal customers who’ve stuck with them. 
It’s a shame the staff changed since the fire. 

Very dissatisfied to say the least.

Hi Kati,

Thanks for your reply.

I don’t find this to be true. 

Firstly, Samantha agreed to give me the reduced rate of €139 and went to check if she could get the taxi sorted. 

Upon ringing me back she stated she could give me 10% of the price was €which I assumed was €139 and she originally quoted the this and then she confirmed it’s €143 and can’t reduce the price Any lower until I made her aware she quoted me €139 originally. 

I find it best or forget me staying at the property as I’ve been let down so many times and as a loyal customer it pains me to say that.

I don’t take pride in having to constantly have these conversations. 

It’s unfortunate you don’t take pride in the value of your customers.",1,2021,08,19
235,So so,Stayed here recently on route to airport.  It was a mixed experience!  One receptionist told us how to access the hotel parking which was part of our deal but she didn't seem to be very knowledgeable on the layout of the hotel.  We had dinner and waitress was lovely and food was good.  We had a shuttle service as part of our deal but it transpires that it's not 24 hours so we had to get a taxi.,3,2021,08,06
235,No food at the inn,"First impression was when we arrived in the car park , 2 locals, were at the front door smocking hash and 3 staff members watching at the door. Check in was fine, rooms looked fine, they looked clean but had an ''old mop'' smell in the bathroom. Myself and the wife noticed a room service menu on the wall in the bedroom and decided we'd go out and get some food later in the hotel. We arrived back at 10.30 and had 2 drinks in the bar, we were told the bar was closed at 11pm due to Covid restrictions, despite these restrictions saying 11.30 was time to close. So we left the bar and on the way to our room we asked a staff member if we could get room service to the room. We were told the kitchen was closed at 11pm due to covid. When asked about the menu's in the rooms he informed us that they need to be taken down. All the while he was telling us about the dangers of room service and covid his face mask was secured firmly below his chin exposing his mouth and nose. There was no talking to the staff and the manager tried to justify the ''no room service after 11 because of covid'' argument, but none of it made sense. We got up to the room and the lock on the door wouldn't work. The bed was rock hard and uncomfortable, and that ''old mop'' smell got worse as the night went on. Following morning at checkout we weren't asked if we enjoyed our stay or if everything was okay. In summery, if you get in on a late flight and expect to be fed and get a drink after 11pm, stay somewhere else!",1,2021,08,01
235,Avoid like the plague.,"Dear Mr Williams
I am having to write this to you as general manager so you are aware of the horrific ordeal we went through at your hotel.
We booked a 2 bed apartment in your hotel and checked in on the 21st. We were given room 1503.
The 15th floor was boiling hot like we had stepped into an oven. The apartment windown opened an inch at best and the balcony being closed just led to the apartment being a giant greenhouse.
We complained about the heat being unbearable that same evening and were told nothing they can do about it. No offer of a fan. We were offered a room in the hotel but I need to work in peace away from my kids hence booking a spacious apartment.
That night I had locked the door as a) I have valuables in the suitcases and b) I have young kids.
In the morning I could not open the lock. The intense heat we had notified your staff of the day before had ruined the door lock and the metal had expanded into the door and wouldn't unlock.
Now the windows open an inch only and no balcony. It was a death trap in the heat we were in.
I am claustrophobic and so is my daughter. Now imagine claustrophobia in a greenhouse type heat. My wife had to call your reception 4 times before someone came to check on the door and screamed at them. She also started to panic due to the lack of responsiveness of your staff. Finally one of your maintainance staff came to check on the door. Whoever he was decided not to bring his tool box and just told us he would be back. At this point my daughter fainted from panic attacks and we had to move her to the sofa and make sure she hadn't hit her head anywhere. She was revived by throwing water on her from our drinking bottles that were in the fridge. At this point it had been 20 minutes in a baking oven of an apartment and I called the fire services to come and rescue us and an ambulance. Both told me the hotel manager needed to call them....I called down to ask them to do this and they did not bother to do this. No one even checked if my daughter was OK after they were told she had fainted
 No doctor was called even after the door was opened.
After the door was opened your hotel manager and workman disappeared and no apology no nothing.
I came downstairs to check out and was issued with what I thought was a refund
That refund has yet to hit my account so will see after the 5 days they advised where it is. The negligence shown by the hotel and its failure to exercise its duty of care for its guests is a serious matter for which we can take legal action",1,2021,07,24
235,Beautiful hotel.,"Beautiful hotel, the separate kids bedroom suited us perfectly. The hotel and rooms were very clean. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Great location for tayto park (20 minutes). Comfortable beds, looks every bit as nice in person as on the website 😀",5,2021,07,18
235,Perfect in every way!,"What a delightful hotel this is!  The staff are so professional, friendly and helpful..they couldn’t do enough for my friend and myself. 
I had been using this hotel as I was attending the Sports Surgery Clinic in Santry and it was so convenient to it.  Stayed here on three separate occasions and never had a fault on any of the visits. It became a home from home!  Spotlessly clean and very comfortable beds. Looking forward to returning when I have to return for my post op review in six weeks time!
Thanks for making what was a stressful time into a lovely experience!",5,2021,05,13
235,Brilliant Hotel ,"What a wonderful hotel. Clean, tidy, warm and welcoming staff. It was a pleasure to stay here. The convenient location to the airport is so handy. Recently refurbished and looks great. Rooms were immaculately clean. And Excellent Value for Money. 
",5,2021,01,19
235,Stunning!!,"Stayed at the Metro Hotel and found the hotel great value for money and the staff  friendly. The hotel has gone through a refurb and it shows, the room was bright and clean.

Would’ve been better if the bar & restaurant were open, they’re completely closed due to covid. Receptionist was very helpful arranging a takeaway so it wasn’t a big deal.

Super service!!!",5,2021,01,18
235,AVOID,"Four stars...How? Freezing cold filthy rooms, both of them! The only clean smell was from the bleached towels! Spoke with Ian on checkout he didn’t seem surprised by the photos I showed him so I assume it’s a regular complaint and was told I’d be contacted by the manager.. I’m still waiting!! NEVER AGAIN! 
See attached photos-dust and dirt EVERYWHERE. ",1,2021,01,14
235,Great,Love this hotel.plenty of parking.the staff are always friendly.it always smells so fresh when you get there lol.it is always so clean and tidy.the rooms are really nice and really quiet.could not ask for any more for the price they charge.always use this hotel when im in dublin,5,2020,10,07
235,Poor all round,"Poor. Had one request; wasn’t fulfilled despite hotel being practically empty. Asked lady on reception for room upgrade which after some to and fro she agreed. Reason for upgrade request was to fulfill request I had made upon reservation and get a smart tv. Got room upgrade, bed was like a rock, the room was smelly, and despite specifically asking for a smart tv in room it didn’t have one- so reverted back to original room given the bed was like sleeping on a rock. Asked again in reception about smart tv/ chrome cast and receptionist said hotel had just been renovated and rooms no longer had these facilities. It’s 2020, why would you renovate and deliberately not get smart TVs for rooms? Next morning breakfast was late arriving, eventually reception rang and asked were we really in room X? (Obviously i was it I answered the phone). Breakfast eventually arrived late and waiter informed me he had been waiting outside 319- not 207 where I was. How hard is it to get the room number right? In addition, maintenance came to the door at 8:50am and walked past my partner to fix a leak in the bathroom next door - we had no leak therefore should not have been disturbed . Completely inappropriate to come to someone’s room unannounced at that time of the morning and not have reception warn you in advance. Breakfast was mediocre, would probably have been a bit nicer if it wasn’t cold. Lady on reception was rather abrupt and argumentative regarding maintenance coming to the room so early and questioned why I didn’t go ahead with room change. I explained that I actually came back to reception and handed back the key card to the other receptionist- clearly there is poor communication there if that simple message couldn’t be passed from one staff member to another. Extremely expensive at €110. Would not recommend.",1,2020,08,27
235,lovely hotel great stay,"We stayed for a few nights, the hotel was very clean, the staff were lovely and so friendly  and helpful, everybody kept their social distance. the rooms were so clean, stickers were put on every item in the room to say it had just been cleaned. we were nervous about going because of Covid 19 but we neednt have been, they did everything  possible to protect us. Location is great, car park perfect and cheap compare to city center prices. would  100% stay again .",5,2020,07,30
235,Safe and secure.,"We last stayed before flying out for a funeral a few weeks before the fire. We found then this hotel to be excellent with a shuttle bus to and from the airport and friendly helpful staff. This visit was to avoid a very early drive from Cork for an appointment in Dublin. The Hotel has understandably had a complete renovation since the terrible fire.
 
On arriving, we parked outside and you check in before using your room card to gain access through security gates and driving downstairs into a locked underground carpark. You can then gain access to the Hotel from the carpark. (There are no signs back from the hotel through the corridors to the carpark, so that would be helpful for future guests.)

We booked a standard double room. Its compact (and the shower room even more compact) but that's to be expected from a City Hotel. It has a contemporary decor and everything you needed for a short stay. The bed was large and good quality bedding and pillows are used. One thing absent that isn't listed in the updated Hotel information, is the tea and coffee facilities. There is a kettle and two paper cups. I did ask reception regarding this and they said it was due to Coronavirus. They did provide me with another paper cup with tea/coffee/sugar sachets (no UHT milk) and that the bar would provide milk on request. Obviously they couldnt do that out of hours. 

Our stay was comfortable. Some staff were very pleasant and welcoming, others we found  less so. The Hotel is good value, clean, secure and comfortable and we would definitely recommend.",4,2020,07,21
235,Family catch up,I recently stayed in the Metro Hotel with my 15 year old 11 year old and 8 year old. We choose the family suite and it consisted of 2 separate bedrooms one with bunk beds and one with a king size bed. Both rooms were spotless and sufficient for our needs and both had a large tv with lots of channels. The bathroom had a big shower but no bath which I thought was strange for a family suite however the shower was lovely lots of hot water and power in it. We would definitely choose to stay here again.,4,2020,07,05
235,Excellent Getaway Break,"I needed a quick break, it was my first time leaving my hometown in 4 months and my experience here was exactly what I needed. 
The staff were extremely professional, friendly and obliging. The room was decorated very tastefully, with the bed being very comfortable to sleep in too. The hotel complied with current restrictions (social distance, hand sanitiser stations, cleaning staff with ppe, etc). 
The cost of my stay was great value for money too. 
Definitely recommended if you want a nice night away.",5,2020,07,04
235,"Great location, great hotel and great staff.","Myself and 2 colleagues having to work in the Dublin airport area recently chose the Metro Hotel purely on it's location. It proved to be a great decision. We  checked  in tired and hungry on a Monday evening and were soon sorted with our rooms and parking permits for our vehicles by the helpful Elena. Our rooms were spotlessly clean and well stocked with clean towels and everything else you expect in a modern hotel room. Some people might think the rooms a bit compact but all three of us thought they were fine. Downstairs there is a very modern bar/restaurant. We were half board which meant a beautiful 3 course meal every evening and the manager Michael was kind enough to allow us to chose from both the bar and restaurant menu. The range and quality of food on offer was excellent. Breakfast had everything to satisfy all requirements. We opted for the full Irish breakfast every morning we were there This was freshly cooked to order each morning and set us up for day ahead. A hotel can be a wonderful building with great food but it needs the right staff to make it work and the Metro certainly has the staff. Sanjay and Flavio started our day off with a smile, the desk staff sorted any queries we had with efficiency and Michael ran the bar/restaurant keeping everybody happy. If I had to single any staff member out it would have to be Vera who served us every evening we stayed there. Her welcoming smile, her obvious enjoyment in her job and her ""nothing is too much trouble"" attitude makes her an asset to an hotel. Thanks Vera for making our stay so enjoyable and relaxing. If you find yourself needing a hotel in the area of Dublin Airport either for flights or work look no further than the Metro. It's also very good value for money and worth talking directly to the hotel regarding rates as we found out.",5,2020,03,14
235,Beautiful Hotel!,"Thank you for a wonderful stay at the Metro Hotel. First of all, the photos from TripAdvisor don't do it justice as the hotel has since been fully renovated and looks beautiful! The interior design is stunning even down to the public area carpets and black doors. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are of a very high standard! I love the grey tiles and the backlit mirror.
Theres a bar off reception but I didn't use it.
Parking is outside the hotel either outside the front door or in a secure gated area across from the building. It is €4 per day. Go to reception and register your car and they will give you a permit to put on your dash.
The staff are wonderful and friendly. Thanks to Elena and Ian for making me feel so welcome.
They also have a shuttle bus to the airport at a small fee but I didn't use this either. The journey to the airport by car is just over ten minutes.
Thank you so much for a great stay. I will stay here next time I'm in the area.",5,2020,03,01
235,Perfect for Adults and kids,"Beautifully decorated, stylist and very roomy, separate child’s room with TV, bunk beds , tea and coffee, little biscuits and great hair dryer. 
Comfortable beds, very clean, nice lamps and occasional chairs . Excellent value for £90 . 

Highly recommend.",5,2020,02,22
235,"Incredible service from your team, a special shout out to Micheal","We have just created a Tripadvisor account just to leave this review.

Super impressed with the Metro Hotel very good value for money.
More importantly, the bar staff and service was unreal... It absolutely made the stay.

In particular, Micheal - You don't' come across personalities like this very often full of energy, super positive, very friendly and active with all the customers. We are doing business in Ireland and I will certainly be back.

The only bad thing about the stay was the fact Liverpool's unbeaten run came to an end, BUT I guess this was out of Metro Hotel's control. :)

Thanks again for a fantastic Trip and this really was a great example of your business is only as good as you people.

Mastercharge",5,2020,02,20
235,Amazing hospitality ,"I checked into the hotel tonight after a cancellation of our flight and was pleasantly surprised that we could book a room! After arriving to the hotel we were greeted by the nicest receptionist Elaine ( I hope im spelling it right 😂) she checked us super quick as we were tired from waiting for our flight! I couldn’t of asked for better service, if there is anything I can say about this place is Elaine needs a raise.",5,2020,02,12
235,Great hospitality,"Took a chance booking for the week of reopening, no need to worry, from the moment we walked in we were met with friendly professional staff who made every effort to make us comfortable. Had a very enjoyable dinner in the restaurant, The Metro is definitely open for business and we will be back!",5,2020,02,07
235,Great service.,"After a full refurbishment this hotel happened to reopen on the day of my arrival. There were a few minor operational issues going on but the staff made sure these had no impact on my stay. 
The room was spotless, the shower had excellent water pressure and the warm salmon salad I had in the restaurant was delicious. 
The hotel is around a 10 minute drive from Dublin airport (by shuttle bus or taxi) and its rates on this occasion were certainly lower than those of the properties within the airport itself, so the Metro Hotel offered great value for money. 
Most importantly, the staff at the hotel were very kind hearted and welcoming, and the Front Desk manager in particular was very professional and efficient.
For a clean and comfortable stay at a reasonable rate this hotel certainly ticks the right boxes.",4,2020,02,07
235,Renovations ,"We actually stayed here during the renovations. Even though the hotel was being refurbished, it didn’t affect us at all. Our room was AMAZING! We had one of the suites, the room was almost a triangular shape, it was something unique. The room was clean, we did have an extra guest, a lovely spider who was actually fairly big... but we trapped him and set him free outside. Some things can’t be helped, he must have heard how fab the rooms were! The food at the bar actually wasn’t good... I got the Bolognese & it tasted more like a lamb stew, there was so much veg in it & nothing actually like a bolognese besides the fact there was meat and spaghetti. Anyway, putting that aside, reception accidentally charged me twice, then said it was my fault! But, the issue was resolved very quickly & turned out not to be my fault, when charging for parking she took out the full amount for the room and the parking fee.... no big deal! Parking is great here you know your car is safe. 
Shame about the fire there recently, especially after the whole hotel was being refurbished, we hope to see ye open soon & return again sometime! ",5,2019,02,11
235,Enjoyed our stay,Checked into this hotel for sleep and a shower after our flight to Dublin from the US. Only stayed for the afternoon but would have been happy to have stayed even longer. The check in process was smooth and the room comfortable.,5,2018,09,03
235,Very happy stay,"Booked one night stay + park car for 21 nights on holidays.comfortable stay,receptionists quick and professional,facilities and supplies good,airport shuttle very helpful and in time.will stay again.Triple room big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids.",5,2018,05,13
235,Be Careful - They Cost Us Hundreds of $$,"We booked a couple months in advance, and a week before our stay, the hotel canceled our reservation with no explanation at all.

As expected, at that time, there were very few properties available, and all cost much more. Obviously, they're not doing this to a majority of their bookings, but just know that you're taking a big risk if you book here.",1,2018,05,07
235,Pleasant stay,"This property is located about ten minutes drive from Dublin airport and they have a shuttle service every 30  minutes. The staff are very pleasant and check in was quick. With regards to the rooms, they are a bit small when compared to hotels in other parts of the world but they are nice, cozy and most of all clean.
There was a problem with the shower regulator but it was sorted out by the hotel in a short while. There is easy access to the bus services into Dublin which takes a max of 15 minutes and the staff are always out to please.
The hotel has a pleasant bar cum dinner lounge. Breakfast is served under two plans, one is a cold breakfast and the other is a hot breakfast. However, I believe that this should change and they should include the full menu under one price and not two separate prices.
But all in all, if you want to stay in a hotel which is close to the airport and not too far from town without actually having to stay in town then I will definitely suggest this property. A special note of thanks to the two drivers of the shuttle who are always very pleasant to talk to.",3,2018,05,06
235,10 min from de airport,"Good option to the night of arrival to dublin or the night before flying back. Use the hotels shuttle because its much less expensive than the cab. Confortable bed, nice staff, but away from city center (unless you have a car).",4,2018,04,30
235,Abandoned and ignored,"We spent a long time looking at hotels in Dublin trying to find one that seemed nice but not overly expensive. After looking at pictures and reading reviews we opted for the Metro Hotel. We managed to find the hotel reasonably easy (we opted for the bus option as we had leap cards), it was a 2 bus journey. On arrival we got checked in, only 1 twin room was available at the time which was right next to the lift on the 2nd floor (noisy) and the room looked a bit shabby. We went back downstairs and asked to swap rooms once another was ready. We were then allocated a room on the 3rd floor and told we could leave our bags and return later which we did. We spent one night in this hotel before disaster struck and we came back on the 2nd day to find the apartments above the hotel on fire and everyone evacuating. 
This is when everything started to go wrong. It was about 8.30pm when we returned to the hotel. We stood outside in the freezing cold watching it burn for about an hour and a half before anyone from the hotel came and spoke to us. We were then sent to a garage as a meeting point and told we would be bussed to another hotel. After getting to the garage and writing down our names, room number and contact details we were put on a bus to another hotel near the airport, however no member of staff from the hotel came with us. We were then left in this hotel's bar for another hour or so with no news of what was happening. We were then called upstairs to a function room where pillows and blankets were laid out on the floor and told there were no rooms available but we could sleep on the floor if we liked. My mum (who I was travelling with) is 63 and this was not an option. We were then told that there was no availability at any other hotels in Dublin for the numbers of us that would require rooms, so if we didn't want to stay at this hotel we could ring round Dublin hotels ourselves and see if they had availability for us or we could go to a hotel in Trim. We had no idea where Trim was but we were informed it was a good 40 minute journey on a coach. Desperate for a bed and at least some sleep we opted for this. We were told a coach would take us out to Trim and then bring us back into Dublin the following day. We arrived at the Knightsbrook Hotel in Trim at about 1am, exhausted and upset. The staff there were brilliant and got us all set up with rooms and told us to come down for breakfast the following morning (which was a bonus as no breakfast was included at the Metro Hotel). The rooms were lovely and we managed to get some sleep. The next morning we managed to get showered (although we had to put the same clothes back on), have a nice breakfast and the lady behind reception gave us toothbrushes and toothpaste. We got ready and went downstairs to wait for the bus that would pick us up. After waiting for a while in the lobby my mum went and spoke to the receptionist who said that her manager had been trying to contact the manager from the Metro Hotel all morning but had heard nothing back from him. We waited for hours and no word came from the Metro Hotel. Other people from the Metro Hotel started booking taxis and making their own way back into Dublin. We were told that the manager of the Knightsbrook still hadn't heard from the Metro's manager and therefore couldn't authorise free taxis back into Dublin and it would cost 60-70 euros to get back to Dublin, with limited funds and some of our euros left in the hotel safe we opted for the bus. This was about 2pm so we'd wasted a whole day waiting for the promised pick up from the Metro Hotel. The receptionist at the Knightsbrook was amazing and sorted out our return flights with ryanair (our passports were also in the hotel safe but they let us fly back on our drivers licences) and she found us a hotel near Dublin for our final night. 
It took about an hour to get back into Dublin. We then went out to the hotel on bus (another 30 mins) to find no-one there and no information left with anyone for hotel guests. A couple of friendly workmen helped us contact someone in the hotel who said that no-one was there and they had no idea when we'd be able to get back into our rooms. We then got a bus back into Dublin, went to Penney's and bought some essentials and then went out to our travelodge hotel (again about 30 mins on a bus). By this point we were exhausted. The travelodge was cold, the windows not sealed properly so we could hear all of the traffic from the noisy road and our noisy neighbours. The next day was our last and we decided to go into Dublin and try and catch up on some of the things we still wanted to do before returning home, instead of wasting time ringing the hotel (by this point both of our phones were nearly dead anyway) or traipsing out to the hotel again.
We flew home that night. 
On returning home my mum emailed the hotel and informed them of some of the things we had left behind in the hotel - most especially our passports, money and house and car keys which we had left in the safe. We were assured that our belongings would be returned to us by courier. 2 weeks after the fire we got our suitcase and bag back (a long time to wait for your personal belongings to be returned to you). We dived in and searched through every item and every pocket only to be left asking where our passports, money etc were. My mum contacted the hotel again asking where our valuables were, worried they had been lost along the way. She got no response. She then emailed again saying how upset and stressed the situation had made her and please could they tell us what had happened to our valuables. The hotel then replied saying that they hadn't checked the safe and it was an oversight. Safe to say it's NOT an oversight when you have been personally informed by a guest that valuable items had been left in the safe and surely all areas of all rooms should have been checked anyway! We then had to wait for another 2 or 3 days for our valuables to arrive. 
Throughout this entire time the hotel were unresponsive, difficult or impossible to get hold of and showed a total lack of care for what happened to those staying at the hotel at this time and going through what was already a stressful and even traumatic situation. The fire, we know, was not their fault but everything that happened after the fire showed poor communication, a disregard for their customers and left us both exhausted, upset and wishing we had never gone.
If you want a hotel that cares for it's customers, with great communication  and a calm head in crisis DON'T book the Metro Hotel.
We have received a couple of apologies in response to our emails but no offer of compensation of any kind and no explanation for why we were abandoned and ignored after the fire.",2,2018,04,09
235,Ideal place to stay with shuttle bus to airport,"We booked this hotel primarily as we were flying from Dublin Airport. Staying the night before our flight, we were able to leave the car in their secure underground carpark and a free shuttle bus took us the 10 minutes to the airport. These leave every half hour from 4.30am so was ideal.
The hotel room was clean, comfy and very quiet. Darkened curtains give you a restful nights sleep. Staff were welcoming and all staff greeted you, even the housekeepers. On returning to the airport you make your way to the assigned pick up point (was no need to call the hotel as the bus was there anyway) and after 10 minutes we were back at the hotel. Staff were waiting to show you into the hotel and the main hotel doors are opened  electronically inside. The reason for this is because people seemed to appear when hotel guests arrived 'asking for change.' 
On departure day we decided to eat breakfast in the hotel. This was a disappointing part of the stay. The service was excellent but it was let down by the food. There was a poor selection of food on offer with cheap bread, wrinkled fruit and limited cereal. It was also very expensive, especially considering the little variety available. Next time we'd make the short trip across the road to IKEA. 
The other downside is the confusion on parking when we arrived. The hotel was easy to find and seeing a carparking gate open, we drove in to find this was a residents car park for the apartments above the Metro Hotel. We followed the sign to the underground car park only to realise you needed a swipe card to access it, so had to reverse back up a sweeping ramp. Better carpark instructions should be given when making the reservation please. 
Would we stay here again? Most definitely and have since our stay recommended it to friends that have also made bookings.",4,2018,04,08
235,Staff members go that little bit extra for you.,"Myself and my father stay overnight here in Feb this year as i had an early flight the next morning. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and checked in without a fuss or delay by a lovely lady named Kristel (i hope i got her name correct).
We fancied a dinner and went down to the dining area...Kristel had already let us know during the check in about the menu and deals that was on offer.We enjoyed a wonderful meal and was about to go to the shop to buy some water for myself when Kristel seen me looking about and asked did i need any help. I told her and she informed me to go to the bar and ask for a jug of water,ice and lemon instead of going to shop and i could bring it up to my room. I got my 5am wake up call and both my father and i went to the reception to await our shuttle bus to take us to the airport. While waiting a member of staff who was working at the reception started talking to us.He was from Poland and was such a lovely guy. I never got his name but he was very nice to us. Our shuttle bus came at the correct time and we were left at the correct terminal without a hitch. Fantastic staff and a well run hotel. Rooms clean and tidy.Bed was perfect to sleep on. 100% satisfied.I have already recommended this hotel to my family.",5,2018,04,01
235,Good Hotel,"Stayed in Hotel last Sunday, early morning appointment in SSC for 6.45am, had early call from reception and was dropped to the door of SSC.  Very impressed with service provided and helpfulness of staff.  Good location for visiting the city, I will return.",5,2018,03,15
235,Stay at the hotel regularly and 100% recommend!!!,"Have been staying at the Metro Hotel for the last 9 months or so, and so have my work colleagues and can honestly say, we have no complaints at all. The rooms are spacious, clean and for a short 2 night stay week on week it suits us perfectly. The staff are friendly, and are always very welcoming. The food menu/s are more than adequate and have never really felt the need to venture out anywhere to eat.

Had an extended stay last week due to Storm Emma, and as much as it was far from an ideal situation, staying at the Hotel made much more bearable!

Thanks to all the staff at the hotel and look forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2018,03,13
235,Great solo stay,"Stayed on my own for one night as I had to go for an operation in the Santry Sports Clinic next morning at 8am. Checking in the receptionist noticed I had a crutch. She upgraded me to a suite with a disabled friendly bathroom. 
The rooms were very modern and clean. TVs with satellite and the suite had sittingroom , small kitchen etc
Staff were very friendly and genuinely helpful. Had an evening  meal in the restaurant. It was lovely and waitresses were easy to talk to. 
Bonus was the hotel bus dropped me at the Clinic in the morning. True the area around has few entertainment options and you wouldn't wander around it late at night.
Ideal hotel if going to the Airport, IKEA,DCU or SSC, . Good value too. Definitely will go back.",4,2018,03,11
235,Nice hotel,Stayed for one night only so cannot say a lot. The room was very lovely decorated and the bed was comfortable. Reception staff were kind and pleasant to deal with. I would stay here if I was going to or coming from the airport.,4,2018,03,03
235,Overpriced and overrated,"Overpriced and overrated. The cab driver told us not to walk around the neighborhood as it was seedy The beds were literally only a few inches apart - 4 inches. The fee for the airport transfer was 5 euro per person ONE WAY !!!!!! That is also the round trip price ad I was given some song and dance about being free one way. It was right on the road and you could hear traffic noise and there were plenty of door slammers on our floor. Th only positive was close proximity to the airport. Stay away from this one, you can do better with your hard earned money.",2,2018,02,28
235,Good place - Excellent service,"Stayed there for a night. 
Very convenient lift from the airport complimentary from the hotel. 
Ian in reception was very helpful, professional and competent. Thanks again! 
Rooms are okay and beds very comfortable. 
Would recommend it! ",5,2018,02,28
235,EXCELLENT,"Very nice airport Hotel with shuttle to and from airport for €5 each way. Taxi into town approx 15€ each way. Hotel is very nice , lovely rooms , spacious and clean with comfortable beds. The restaurant food was good and staff extremely nice , with a special mention for the young girls and guys at bar/restaurant.",5,2018,02,27
235,"Cold room, noisy street","I stayed here with my daughter the night before an early morning flight to avoid having to drive up the motorway during the night. Check in was fine, we availed of the park and fly option and the entry to the underground car park was a little difficult having to wait for reception to buzz us through one of the gates, the car park itself is dreary and it also seems to be used as a dumping site for hotel items. We were upgraded to a family room, but it was nothing special, bathroom was terrible, very cold, dated and reminded me of an old hospital bathroom. Our bedroom was small and very narrow overlooking an IKEA store. The room was freezing and took a while to heat up, can’t understand why the heating wasn’t on when they were given a check in time. The food in the bar was lovely as were the staff. My problem was the noise out on the street by traffic and people passing. We were woken several times by it resulting to us being exhausted in the morning so the stay defeated the purpose. The shuttle bus was good, on time and easy pickup on our arrival. 
If getting an early morning flight again, I’d book a better hotel with sound proof windows.",2,2018,02,24
235,It just gets Better,"I have already made my views known about the value , friendliness, and excellent experiences we have had in the past,and on our most recent visit  we were met by Sean who very kindly organised a space in the underground car park . he is a wonderful ambassador for the Metro and his patience and ability to handle pressure without compromising quality of service is deserving of mention.
Mario in the Bistro 9 is also worthy of a mention for his superb manner in handling of two very rude and noisy children who were playing Hide and Seek whilst we and several other customers were trying to enjoy our evening meal. Their parents were not in the least bit interested in controlling their offspring and without Mario's intervention I myself would have gone over to the parents . Excellent work Mario. 
All of the Metro Staff seem to have the ethos of looking after the Customer and we always feel that we are not room 210  but Mr & Mrs Clark guests of the hotel , and couple this with the excellent value the hotel offers , hen you have the best deal for an airport hotel. 
Thank you again Sean for making us feel at home and for the room with a ""wet room "" which enabled my wife to have a shower without any effort.
See you all again in November",5,2018,02,23
235,"Great for an overnight stopover for the airport, Santry Sports Clinic or IKEA!","Myself and my husband had a brief overnight stay at the Metro Hotel recently. We arrived late and the service we received from both Barbara at reception and the night porter was outstanding. I’m obviously pregnant and the night porter asked the shuttle bus driver to move his own car so we could have a space near the door! Hotel is very convenient for Dublin Airport, the nearby Santry sports clinic and IKEA is across the road! Would definitely stay again. Very reasonable rates!",5,2018,02,17
235,1 night break,"Clean warm hotel with friendly staff and delicious food. Would definitely stay here again, we stayed in a suite with floor to ceiling windows but it was so warm and cosy in the room and the bed was very comfortable.",5,2018,02,17
235,"Warm, friendly and well connected + cracking value","I needed a twin room for a 2 night stay in Dublin for the horse racing at Leopardstown (plus sightseeing and an evening in the city) and decided that the city centre would prove to be overpriced and would lack that intimate warmth that an out-of-town hotel would offer. 
Metro Hotel Dublin proved that my instincts were correct. Firstly, the cost - it was one of those cases where you get more than you pay for....would have happily paid a fair bit more for the level of comfort and staff friendliness in all honesty.

I'd recommend pre-arranging the shuttle-bus to and from the airport (5Euro). I had read about it but decided that I would use my Leap Visitor Card to get from the airport.....dont make that mistake. After much strolling up and down the bus stops I gave up and got a taxi (cost about 13Euro). However we did make use of the shuttle on the way back with the minubus dropping you right outside of the required terminal. Just have a word with the reception staff and the transport will be waiting outside to collect your bags.

The stay itself was perfectly fine. The twin room was as you would expect and absolutely fine for our needs. The bathroom was of a decent size as was the shower (although the shower was a tad cold....turning the heat up meant that the water flow was so diminished that it became a compromise between heat and water).
The bar area is just lovely and the staff are always on hand for a chin wag or will happily leave you to enjoy the surroundings. 
The only meal I had while there was breakfast on the final morning and this was a treat. Decided to go for the full breakfast option with hot + continental options and took full advantage with fruit + yoghurt, toast, full hot breakfast then some pastries all washed down with nice strong black coffee.

Getting around proved pretty straightforward. Just a 1 minute walk took you to the main road where 2 buses would run you into the city centre. I did find to my cost that they didn't return to the hotel much after 11.30pm so ended up getting and different bus followed by a 20 minute walk.....so check the timetables if you intend to stay out late.

Overall - my stay exceeded my expectations and would happily stay again.",4,2018,02,07
235,Good for business,"Friendly, welcoming and comfortable. Also open at most hours of day and night.
The front desk team were great and I had a good night'r rest.
The WIfi was also working a treat :)

I can't comment on food as I was not there long enough to eat.

My trip was short but they provided just what I needed when I needed it -",4,2018,02,07
235,Reviews don't lie,"Very friendly, comfortable place. Dinner both evenings excellent and very well presented and breakfast you could want for none.  Mario and staff always attentive, cheerful and look after your every need. My mother will now only stay here. Rooms clean and tidy, tv ironing board and coffee facilities an added bonus.
Parking not very well sign posted but once you're in... ",4,2018,02,02
235,"Great Value, good location ","Booked at short notice to attend an event close by. So much cheaper than our options closer to the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and at the usual standard of a chain hotel. There was free secure parking. No frills convenience at a great price.",5,2018,01,30
235,Great value with a few quirks,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 night over the Christmas period with my wife and 3 kids for a quick break in Dublin. Firstly, this place is really cheap and has a few quirks, that you would expect and some benefits that you wouldn't for the money. 

Firstly, the weaker elements... 1). The pull out sofa beds have the worst quality mattresses ever made, and I mean ever, they were atrocious and we considered leaving after the first night, as the kids were sore in the morning from them. 2). Entering the lift you may fear that you will never come out of it, as it's very odd shaped and weirdly slow. 3). The interior core  of the hotel, (which I'd say was built as an apartment block...) is just one big rectangular ""ish"" void, leaving the bedrooms scattered all around it, which is very strange looking. 4). The breakfast set up is also weird, in that you have to bring everything to the table yourself, including, spoons, milk, etc. and as soon as you are finished there's a guy there to take your plate....very annoying. 5) The area seems dodgy, so much so that you have to wait outside and buzz in... Oh, and there is no swimming pool, maybe just as well...

The good stuff...1) Staff are nice in general. 2) Rooms are very clean and warm, with nice furnishings. 3) TVs in rooms and tea/coffee are perfect. 4) The main beds are very comfortable. 5) If you have a car and don't want to get fleeced, it's a good place to stay with connection to the city, while being 20 mins away by car. 6) Parking is free.

In conclusion, this hotel has issues, but you get exactly what you pay for here, no nonsense. It's a good place, just note the obvious issues before booking.",3,2018,01,30
235,Convenient Location,"The hotel was conveniently located near Dublin airport.

The hotel offered a shuttle bus service to the airport.  The location was very useful for an early morning departure.  The public bus provided easy access to the city.",4,2018,01,28
235,Nice enough hotel for the price but noisy room,"I got a tiny room on the fourth floor but it was grand because I was staying on my own. However, the windows could do with some soundproofing or something because I could hear cars driving past all night and the wind was even pretty loud. Additionally, there was a loud buzzing noise coming from the electrics box in my room that only stopped when I took the key card out of the slot, shutting off all the power. I needed to charge my phone so I tried to sleep through the noise. 
Parking is not intuitive at all. The carpark outside reception is tiny and pretty fully so I had to abandon my car to go in to check in to find out where I was supposed to park for the night. Turns out that was the right thing to do, but it would have been good if that was mentioned in the reservation email.",3,2018,01,23
235,Nice hotel but too warm,"Stayed here in November for a night before a flight. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, same couldn't be said for the barman who was too busy texting on his phone while myself and another customer stood waiting to be served. It was a quiet evening in the bar so we were obviously an inconvenience to him having to serve us every so often. The bar food was nice but the heat in the bar was unreal, there was a small group of us and every one of us were complaining about how hot it was in there.

Heat in rooms made it very uncomfortable too, didn't get a great sleep as a result. Other than that, rooms were clean and well maintained. Parking at hotel is cheap and handy for airport too, small fee for the bus transfer but worth it.",3,2018,01,16
235,Second great stay,"We stayed last summer before early flight and were very happy with our stay and car parking facilities. Stayed again for one night the week before Christmas before flying to states and once again it was a lovely relaxing stay before long journey. The staff are truly the nicest people ever. I hope I have remembered their names properly, ian who greeted us very warmly on arrival to reception and Mario the chef in the very comfortable bar and restaurant. Had a very nice dinner and atmosphere very good and decorations very tasteful. There was a really nice he gentleman on the door who guided us to good parking space and the bus driver the next day was very pleasant and helpful. Room was clean and spacious and bed comfortable. I would not stay anywhere else now when flying out on morning flight. I honestly think they are brilliant with customer service and seem like genuine lovely people who enjoy their job. I hope the management are very proud of their staff team.",5,2018,01,15
235,Stopover in Dublin,We stay at the Metro. On our way down South from Belfast. It was very easy to find. Just of the motorway. Our room was very clean and spacious. A little tired but clean. The bathroom looks as if they have been redone recently. Had our evening meal in the restaurant which was yumm. Good service from reception to restaurant staff. We will definitely be staying here again.,4,2018,01,10
235,Excellent,"The rooms are very clean, the beds are very comfortable and the shower is awesome. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is not too far from both the airport (they provide a shuttle bus) and the city center.",5,2018,01,08
235,Wondeful,Absolute first class service from start to finish especially from Krystal on reception. Check in was great with lots of info about buses and Dublin. Such friendly staff throughout. Room was lovely and surrounding area was quiet. Had a nice drink in the bar and the got bus into town. When we got back the reception even helped us order a pizza and gave us a call when it arrived. In morning with a hangover asked for late check out and was to be €15 euro but when we left Krystal waived the fee which was a lovely gesture. Defo would recommend staying here great links to Oconnell St. Shuttle bus service was brilliant and well worth it. Great craic with driver on way back to airport also.,5,2018,01,03
235,Lovely helpful staff and great decor.,"I needed a place to stay for one night before flying out from Dublin airport. I arrived pretty late from work, grabbed dinner in the very cosy bar and slept well in the well decorated, small but perfectly organised room. Checkout was really simple and the shuttle bus went on time.
I will stay here again.",5,2018,01,02
235,"Mixed feelings- great staff, poor facility","Stayed one night and booked the car parking while away. 
Found the staff brilliant very helpful. The bedroom was very poor. 5 of us had a sort of 2 room place and the main bed was comfortable but the fold out couches were really very hard and poor. We decided as we were flying early next morning to let the kids have the bed and we just sat up all night, not great! A shower then to get going for our days traveling, wet room...I thought great but no the shower area was really dirty. One of us had a wash and felt even more dirty after it so the rest of us didn’t bother. The food in the bar was very nice and again the service excellent. The bus transfer to and from the airport was brilliant maybe 10 mins and the driver was very pleasant and had us in stitches laughing. The car park was not great at all. The first car park was full so I had to park in number 2 which is a few minutes walk from the hotel through an adjoining apartment complexes car park. I didn’t feel at all safe to be honest.  
I don’t think we will be back. The service was great but really what we wanted was secure parking (ok the car was fine after the week) but the area just felt dodgy and somewhere to sleep before we went and while the kids did we didn’t and it knocked into our holiday then being tired. ",3,2018,01,02
235,Great stay!!!,"Stayed in the hotel mid September with family visiting DCU. Great location as it was within walking distance. Airport was very close too. Great staff, thanks to Sean at reception, he was very friendly and the rest of the team for looking after us!!!",5,2017,12,29
235,Ms,"Great hotel, special thanks to Seán at this reception, lovely man. Nice clean rooms, comfy beds and easy to get to places from the location. Nice food in restaurant, pleasant staff. Bus routes nearby that take you directly to the city center, very handy.",5,2017,12,26
235,Second Chances!,"So my last stay at the metro in August of 2017 was not “the best”..  we chose this hotel to stay at as we were arriving back from a holiday at 9pm & it was close by. 
The staff were shockingly rude, but I can be just as rude, there seemed to be an issue with my card... i was told that my room would be cancelled and they could help me find a hotel close-by. I knew this was not an error on my behalf & I phoned my banks emergency line & they explained that the hotel had already taken their preauthorized funds and were attempting to recharge me which is why it declined, once the receptionist understood my frustration she acknowledged the fault was hers and became VERY friendly. She was actually a very lovely lady & turned out to be very helpful, she was more than happy to extend our check out time as an apology & our parking was free of charge. We stayed in the suite which was on the refurbished part of the hotel. The room was beautiful & extremely clean. I feel that most reviews don’t take the accommodation teams into account, the area I stayed in was spotless & my kitchenette, toilet, bedroom & so on was impeccably clean. 
I am returning to give the place a second chance on the 28th & hope to have my iffy attitude toward the hotel changed. ",3,2017,12,23
235,Trip over night,"What a wonderful place to stay
On arrival we were treated by very helpful
Staff .
We had a meal an drinks what value for money. We could not fault it.
A must for anyone coming to Dublin.
So close to the airport with a shuttle service to sute your needs.",4,2017,12,21
235,Park & Ride,I had another very positive park & ride experience with Metro. Got space in Park 1 which is great. Staff very friendly. Shuttle driver was excellent. Not sure of his name but he is the Italian guy :-) . Thanks again.,5,2017,12,18
235,Works,"Stayed here while attending a Christmas do in town. Handy to get to both by car and later by taxi. 

No frills but a good standard and for that price I didn’t expect more. Parking a bit tricky but not a game changer. 

Nice pint too. ",4,2017,12,17
235,Metro hotel ,"At the hotel for 10 days, I must say that all the team is very nice, especially Mario, Petrolina, a french guy and the bus drivers.

The food is good, the bedroom is clean and very confortable. Maybe a little bit noisy with the morning traffic.

Overall a very good experience with this hotel.",5,2017,12,16
235,Super restaurant ,"I am staying at the hotel till next Thursday, by the way it is the first time that I'm leaving a message on trip advisor because I must mention that Mario and her colleague Petrolina (at the restaurant) were very professional , the service was excellent.

They were very kind and helpful for me, a French guy dropped in Dublin city!!!

I had to notify it!!
",5,2017,12,16
235,Very helpful staff,Such a heartwarming and efficiently run hotel - stayed here for a week during some flight training. Bartenders Mario and Marius were extremely friendly and helpful with some tips for the city. Will recommend do whoever I can!,5,2017,12,13
235,Close to Dublin airport,"This is a good hotel if, like me, you are looking for a hotel close to the airport. Rooms are spacious, breakfast is good and check in/out is prompt. Hotel offers shuttle service to/from Airport. About a 18 euro taxi ride into Dublin. Not many eateries that I could find near to the hotel arriving in the evening, but there is a takeaway (fish and chips, etc) about 50m away).",4,2017,12,13
235,Great airport hotel,"Arrived hotel at 8am and receptionist worked hard to get us into our room, after a delicious breakfast we were given keys to our room, great work.
Brad the hotel security officer the. Helped us to our room as usual we had far to many suitcases.",5,2017,12,12
235,Disappointing but probably due to unfortunate set of events.,"First time to stay here and location specific for late arrival an dearly departure. Room compact and generally very clean, bathroom being the exception. Pre-booked parking unnecessarily complicated. Maintenance and house-keeping staff appear not to communicate in this case. Possibly an unfortunate co-incidence of circumstances so we will give it another chance in the future but lots of remedials to be going on with in the meantime. Specifics raised with hotel management via feedback channel.",3,2017,12,10
235,Fantastic,"The staff really make this hotel they are so helpful, friendly and welcoming.  My ears popped landing in Dublin, the shuttle bus driver went out of his way to get me sweets to suck to try and ‘unpop’ my ears....5 star service!!!  Would not stay anywhere else at Dublin airport!!!",5,2017,12,06
235,Great stay,"Had a lovely stay in your hotel Saturday night with my boyfriend, great service as always and the renovations in the restaurant are a breath of fresh air. Thanks to the shuttle driver who brought us from the airport and Sean at reception  who helped us with our boarding passes!! ",5,2017,12,05
235,Quick trip to Dublin,"Metro Hotel resides close to city centre (7 min) with restaurants and shops nearby. The restaurant is cozy, food is great and staff is very friendly! Special thanks to Mario for the quick service! Will definately come again!",5,2017,12,04
235,Great stay! ,"Very nice rooms, clean and excellent service by the whole stuff - especially Mario.
Also food in the restaurant is delicious and at reasonable prices.
The shuttle service was always in time and driver courteous. ",5,2017,12,04
235,Quite surprised,"I was booked into this hotel by the planning team at work and upon first impressions I wasnt impressed. Parking seemed to be pay and display and the area looked grim. On entering the hotel it was clean and bright and a free pass was provided for parking. 
The room was clean and comfortable with everything expected in a hotel room. 
I ate in the restaurant and was shocked. The quality of the food was really good. 
I slept well thanks to blackout curtains and breakfast was adequate to set me up for a long day of work. ",4,2017,12,04
235,Relaxing,Had a lovely night sleep and good food and enjoy the night staylovely staff and very friendly we had a good breakfast in the morning before heading home by train.would recommend it for a good stay to our family and friends.,5,2017,12,03
235,Great Hotel - Friendly Staff and Recommended.,"I have been staying here 2 nights a week since May - I have to say it is great. The recent renovations have made the Restaurant much better and have generally smartened the reception area up. The rooms are of a decent size, the internet signal is strong, there are sufficient power outlets in all rooms and the showers are powerful and clean. I find the team very friendly, they greet me by first name, they make me feel welcome on every visit and I find the team that provide the shuttle bus service to and from the airport friendly and efficient. A big shout out to Micheal, Ian and the entire team at The Metro. Highly recommended.",5,2017,12,03
235,Hidden Gem,"Had a great one night stay, lovely modern hotel with underground parking, nice simple room with huge shower and comfy bed. Would highly recommend to anyone and it’s very near the airport too with a very convenient shuttle bus service.",5,2017,12,02
235,Great spot,From the courtesy bus driver at the airport to the helpfull young man at the bar. This spot is convenient spotless and value for money. Staff excellent. especially bar /restaurant and reception.  Well done ,5,2017,12,02
235,Nuce,"We stayed here 1 night 
As we were flying out the following am. Check in was efficient. The room was cosy and tea coffee facilities provided. We ate in the restaurant the food and service was good. Shuttle to the Airort the following morning and Take away coffees 
We will be back ",4,2017,12,01
235,Expectations plus one for value price,"We stayed for a week with our 3 children in family suite. The good location and family friendly hotel. The reception staff were extremely helpful. Very professional, polite, friendly and quick service with smile. The highlight of our visit in the Metro Hotel was the help and friendliness of the receptionist Kristel. She made my family stay very welcoming one.
The room was clean and everyday cleaning was well done.
The shuttle bus service was good, the bus driver Marcin was flexible and nice.
Would definitely come back again and recommend to others.",5,2017,11,30
235,"Despite some good points, the place is SCAMMY","1) it is NOT an airport hotel. It's abut 2 km away
2) They CHARGE for their shuttle bus and it leaves the airport every half hour later in the day (IT'S COLD SITTING OUT THERE!) and leaves the hotel once per hour in the morning, on THEIR schedule not yours. Not worth it- take  taxi- the price of your hotel experience just went up about $25 bucks.
3) you can't get ANYTHING to eat unless you buy a 11 euro package meal (for breakfast- later meals more expensive and not a la cart). so no brewed coffee or tea with milk. In-room coffee maker not acceptable. 2 tea bags, 2 instant coffee packets (YUCK) and two little tiny fake creamers provided.
4) Cold not adjust hot water in shower, despite studying the non-user friendly instructions. had to take splash bath in sink.
5) Not enough electrical outlets in the room to charge your devices; some adaptors available from front desk but lots of trouble to get them .
6) Poor internet signal
6) Dude behind the desk was so fakey-friendly. You could tell he couldn't not possibly care less about you.

Place was very clean; bed comfy.",1,2017,11,30
235,Great Find.,"My first time staying in this hotel and I was amazed at the facilities. The receptionist was first class and on arrival I was given a choice of a welcome pack. I chose one that included bedroom slippers and many useful items. 
My room and shower room were spotless. Tea/coffee making facilities, hair dryer, free wi-fi, television etc.
The on-site restaurant had a good choice of menu and the food I ordered was excellent. Beautiful dining room and the service was faultless. 
There is a shuttle bus to the airport for a mere cost of €10, this can be ordered the night before at reception.
Good location.",4,2017,11,29
235,Just right,"Excellent stay at the Metro Hotel, Dublin. Comfortable, quiet rooms, friendly staff and excellent food. Convenient for the city centre as just a few footsteps from the nearest bus stop. If you’re feeling energetic, it’s a brisk 1:15 walk right into the heart of the city. 

A big thank you to Mario, Marius and Lorenzo for making our bar visits, of which there were plenty, so welcoming. You’re a real credit to the hotel ;)
",5,2017,11,24
235,"Friendly staff, clean, comfortable","The accommodation is clean, modern and comfortable. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful (especially Marius and Mario). I very much enjoyed my three-week stay here on business during November 2017.",4,2017,11,23
235,Nice Quiet Hotel Near Dublin Airport,"The Metro Hotel is very clean and comfortable and I found the reception staff very helpful on arrival,also @ check-out time the following morning.
For anyone looking for somewhere close to Dublin International Airport you may find it useful to know that the Metro Hotel is 3 and a half miles away,however the hotel provides an excellent bus service.There is a fee of 5 Euro for your journey to Dublin International which takes about 10 minutes. I certainly had no problems getting there.",5,2017,11,21
235,Nice hotel with a great restaurant,"We stayed for two nights at this hotel to venture out into Dublin and also be close to the airport for our early flight home. We had a car, and they do have paid parking on the premise, I believe it was 4 euros a day. We actually took city transit into Dublin for the day, and the bus comes often and takes about 40 mins to get into the city. 

Our room was nice and modern, including the bathroom. It looked like everything was upgraded. The room was small for us as we were travelling with our infant child, which meant A LOT OF STUFF haha, and once the pack and play was in the room there was not much room left to walk around. The hotel was pretty full that night and they were unable to move us. You can hear the traffic in the hallway - people closing their doors, walking and talking in the hallway. Normally this wouldn't have bothered us, but because we had an infant, the hall way noise kept waking him up :( this was the reason why it was 4 and not a 5 for us. I would stay here again and still recommend it to others. 

The restaurant in the hotel though, that is where it is at. The meals were so good! Because we had an infant we had to be close to our room to put him to sleep early instead of eating in the city. Luckily the meals did not disappoint! They also had a great deal where they had an early bird special that was a steal! The meals were delicious and the staff in the restaurant were so attentive and friendly.",4,2017,11,20
235,Great Stay!,"I stayed here with my mum before an early flight. Everything was perfect. Secure parking which is great and shuttle to the airport. Special mention to Ian on Reception, what an absolute pleasure he was! The hotel is lucky to have someone like Ian with fantastic customer service! Another mention to the security guard (I think!) who guided us to the underground parking and walked with us back to the hotel. Such a pleasant person! Generally, overall the staff were so pleasant and attentive. Will definitely return.",5,2017,11,18
235,Still Our Favourite Airport Hotel,"I wold like to think that at 71 years of age that I had gained some experiences of the good the bad and the terrible hotels that I had visited both here and abroad.
many people write reviews because they are unhappy or because they feel they had a good experience in a particular hotel.
I can only give my opinion on the Metro and it is no coincidence that I have had wonderful nights there, I read several of the no so good reviews and can not agree with their content.
Yes when we first went to the Metro years ago it was a little tired but Mark Williams and his team have transformed the hotel , the rooms we stayed in were all first class. the front of house staff most friendly , the Bistro 9 staff and food excellent, and I appreciate that perhaps the area may not be user friendly at night , so are many of the areas down at the Dockland where there are may other hotels , so fot me it is not an issue, Be careful where ever you are.
I have mentioned before this hotel is not The Shelbourne  or The Raddisson but it is the best value in town for an Airport Hotel or  as an overnight if we visit The Sports Surgey Clinic just around the corner.
This is an excellent hotel doing what it says : providing , good food, service with a smile, and  comfy beds in well appointed bedrooms.  We will be booking again for our February 2018 trip 
As a special note :   this time  we arrived back  at car park 16  at 16,43 and Noel the shuttle driver arrived at exactly 16.45 and advised us that there was exceptional  heavy traffic on the M50 so he was taking an alternative route (old airport road up Northwood Ave) and had us back at the Metro at 17.00  
We were on the road West at 17.05 and missed the very heavy traffic  and got onto the M6 without too much trouble , Thank you Noel",5,2017,11,17
235,Very clean and cosy hotel,"The hotel is close to the airport and has his own airport shuttle service. If you arrive at the airport and want to go to the hotel the shuttle is for free. If you want to go to the airport from the hotel it costs 5€\ person. I think that is ok.
The hotel rooms are very cosy and clean. I feel comfortable here. If you have a room to the street it is sometimes loud. But sleeping is no problem at all.
A Busstation is 5 minutes away. No problem at all. So all together I must say: perfect hotel for a trip to Dublin!",5,2017,11,17
235,Ideal Location for DCU,"We recently stayed for a graduation in DCU.  The staff we meet were very friendly, courteous and helpful.  I had booked a family suite which was very spacious and comfortably slept 4 of us. There was a separate bedroom which was a good size.  Adjoining was another room with 2 pull out double sofa beds.  In this room there was also a kitchenette, with a fridge , microwave, & kettle.There was a flat screen TV in both roooms.Wi Fi was free and of a good standard. I would have to say this was one of the best family rooms I have stayed in.While a bit dated, the room & bathroom were spotlessly clean, warm & comfortable.
I would definitely stay again & would recommend the family suite.",4,2017,11,16
235,Needs improvement,"I had a hard time deciding between 2 and 3 stars for this hotel. I went with 2 because there are a couple of things that could have easily made this worth of 3 + stars. First, although this location is close to the airport, it is not a ""safe"" area, according to locals. So please don't wander around. It is also quite a ride away from the downtown area. You can make the trip inexpensively by bus, or for about 45 Euros by Uber Black. *Uber Black is the only Uber option in Ireland* We did not have a lot of time during our overnight, so we spent more time than usual in our hotel. 

The room: Our room was on the end of the building facing the airport, and it was very noisy and small. There is no air conditioner, so if your room is stuffy, you are forced to open the windows to let air in. The problem with the windows is that they do not stay open when a stiff breeze blows through. Perhaps the locking mechanism was broken on ours? We also took issue with the noise. The hotel was modestly noisy, but adding in the traffic with the open windows made it very hard to sleep.
Most of our outlets did not work - no big deal, there was only 2 of us. But it was frustrating walking outlet to outlet just to find a place to charge your phone or plug in a hair dryer. 

The bathroom: I am reviewing this separately from the room because, aside from no air con, this was the biggest issue for me. The toilet is built into a wood cabinet that seems to nearly fall apart anytime you are sat down. I could hear creaking and see the crack between the wall and the porcelain, so I chose to hover (TMI?) in our bathroom. I am a small lady, and my husband is no more than 170 LBS, so I cannot imagine a larger guest sitting down without a catastrophe. As for the shower, the water temperature would not come off of the ""scalding hot"" setting. In fact, it should be illegal for water to get this warm in a hotel bathroom. I had blisters on my forearm after trying to manipulate the handle to the cold position. My husband also could not get the water to work properly, so we settled for a shower at the airport lounge. The edges of the wall, as well as the corners and tiles were also quite dirty in the bathroom. We found hair in the bathtub AND inside the non-slip mat. It was not a pleasant experience at all.

Hotel bar: So this was the best part of the hotel. The bar manager (we think?) was so pleasant and helpful. It looks as though they are re-doing many things in the hotel, and the bar area is lovely. It is warm and inviting, and the food was wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed a quiet, rainy evening in here at the lounge. Our portions were perfectly sized, and they had a great selection of beverages. There are also very nice bathrooms in the lobby/lounge, in case your room's is atrocious. Overall, we would stay here again simply because of the experience here.

The staff: While most of our staff interaction was check in and at the bar, I have to say that the first half was not great. We felt that we were more of an inconvenience to the desk staff than anything.We also did not get the ""welcome gift"" we chose upon booking. Although once we stopped by later in the evening, the staff had changed out and they were quite pleasant. 

Overall: If you have an early flight out, this is a decent choice. Please know that even though you can practically see the airport from this hotel, it is still a 20 minute ride to get there. The hotel is in need of some makeovers. The walls aren't painted evenly (who cares, really?), the rooms are small, the bathrooms are dreadful (except for the ones in the lounge), and the outlets are hit or miss. However, the staff and location really seemed to make up for a lot of these issues. It is definitely a one-nighter hotel. 

TL;DR - 
Small rooms
Noisy
Lovely staff
No air con
Dirty bathrooms
Convenient to airport
Great lounge area",2,2017,11,13
235,1st night in Dublin,The hotel was easy to find from the car rental place.Easy to catch a bus to city center and back. Room was small but we got by it was clear the bed was good  one draw back was on a busy street but if you kept your window closed it was fine. Loved the towel warmers we did find out  most place you stay in Ireland do not have wash clothes you use your hands. The front desk help went out of their way to make our visit wonderful thank you all especially Christie.,4,2017,11,13
235,Depends on what you're looking for,"This is a good hotel with excellent staff. If you want an airport hotel for an overnighter it really would be hard to beat. It's not really suitable for a tourist visit to Dublin. You are quite far out and the surrounding area is unappealing. Some small niggles breakfast at 11 Euro is worth it. Chef very cheerful and made pancakes to order. However dirty teapots left out and the pastries weren't replenished during my sitting
 My big problem with the hotel was when coming from my parked car at around midnight I was subjected to aggressive and threatening begging from 2 persons obviously on something in the darkened car park. Scary for me a mature male 6'1"" this shouldn't be happening 20 feet from the hotel door!",3,2017,11,12
235,Solo Visit,"I was travelling back from a business trip from UK, I was picked up by the shuttle bus at the airport and brought to hotel.   after checking in which was about 22.45 I went into the bar where there were only 2 other customers.   I order a pint and following that I ordered a second pint.  After a couple of minutes the bar lady asked me to take my drink out to room in the hallway as she was closing - it was just after 23.30.    When I finished my drink I went to leave the empty glass into the bar but the Security told me the bar was closed and he took the glass off me.   I thought they would have mentioned that being a resident I could have another drink - but I was not pushed.   After checking the book in the room about bar it did say bar was closed at 23.30 but residents could get a drink after 23.30 at the discretion of the management.",3,2017,11,10
235,A better choice of Airport Hotel!,"My family and I were in Dublin for 2 nights going to concerts in the 3 arena and were looking for a hotel 
and our son and girlfriend were flying to Paris for a few days after that so we saw the Metro hotel Dublin Airport good prices and
 located near to the Dublin tunnel for our gigs 
and shuttle to Airport and
 My much needed trip to Ikea across the road !!
We got a family suite with a kitchenette in it (which would be great for a family with small children with Micro and fridge kettle and toaster )
We just made coffee but it was very comfortable lovely and bright no flight noise at all 
Staff were so helpful and friendly 
Bar food good and good prices 
Free parking and shuttle bus to airport 
Great Value and we all decided it was going to be our new Airport Hotel 
We’ve. Trip coming up end of Nov and have booked our room and Parking already !!",4,2017,11,06
235,Recommended!,"The room was very comfortable and clean. I heard no noise at all.
Staff ere helpful, kind and friendly.
Very close to the airport; the hotel provides guests with a shuttle bus service.
I would come back but it could be cheaper though!",5,2017,10,23
235,Week Long Stay,"We stayed in October for a week with our 3 children.  We were very happy with our stay.

Prior to our stay, we would email with questions, and receive prompt responses that were helpful and friendly. This was the only hotel we could find that would accommodate a 5 person family with a kitchenette, in the area we needed.

The location of the hotel worked well for our needs. We had to be near the airport for an event, and we wanted to spend a lot of time in the city centre. This spot was kind of between both, so we were happy with it. Between 10-15 mins driving to either.

The room was spacious, clean and worked very well for the 5 of us. The sofa beds were not comfortable, but that’s usually the case with sofa beds so we made due.

The staff were extremely friendly, and always quick to call us a taxi when needed, give us bus route info, and help us out. 

The food at the restaurant was okay... but I’m a fairly picky eater so I’m not the best judge. Get the brownie for dessert... you will NOT be disappointed! The restaurant and bar staff were fantastic and treated us well!

There are some renos going on currently, but the only disruption was during one of the meals, and it was minimal.

There is a grocery store within walking distance (go to Supervalue, not Aldi) and a variety of take out places which was very handy considering we had 3 kids under 12 with us. 

Use the bus system for city centre from the hotel. Much cheaper than taxi and quick and easy.

If I returned to Dublin in a similar situation, I would definitely stay here again!
",4,2017,10,17
235,Great stay for next day early flight,"This is a good hotel for several reasons - 1) good customer service. The staff went out of its way to help us find our way into Dublin, right bus, correct change, etc. Also pointed out local stores for late night snacks. 2) fast and easy to get to the airport for early flight - good shuttle at 5 euros RT 3) comfortable room. We never heard other people or TVs or doors slamming. The hotel is getting a bit of a face lift however, everything works, is clean and it is very comfortable. And Free Internet",4,2017,10,13
235,Very nice hotel!,"The hotel is undergoing a renovation in the bar and restaurant but it was still very nice food and staff in restaurant were very friendly and professional.  In particular, one waiter in restaurant called Lorenzo was exceptional, he took care of of every need and was chatty, professional and the service was excellent.",4,2017,10,10
235,Over night stay,Would recommend this hotel for an overnight stop before going to Dublin airport shuttle bus cheap and car parking secure approx 7 minutes to Dublin airport and on return a quick phone call and the shuttle will pick you up again,5,2017,10,10
235,Hh,Excellent hotel.Close to airport with shuttle service.All staff friendly .efficient. and courteous. Would definitely stay there again.Great value for money.got room snd dinner package with wine by booking direct with hotel.,4,2017,10,10
235,Ideal park stay & fly,"My stay at the metro hotel was extremely pleasant. Everything from secure parking, bedroom cleanliness & standards, dining in the hotel, shuttle to & from airport was 1st class. I stayed the night before I flew off on holidays & availed of the free 1st nights parking as well as sampling from the early bird menu in the hotels restaurant. I found all staff; reception, waiting, bar & shuttle bus drivers to be extremely friendly & helpful. I will definitely be booking again when travelling from Dublin & have recommended the hotel to friends. Fantastic value for money.",5,2017,10,10
235,Close to airport,We stayed here our last night in Ireland because it was close to the airport and had parking (for a fee). They also have shuttles to and from airport if you did not rent a car. The room was clean and bed was comfy. The bathroom clean. The food in restaurant is not that great.,3,2017,10,08
235,A Pleasent Surprise,"Stayed at this hotel myself and my husband the night before our ongoing journey and again the night we got back,
Even though it was having renovation work done it was welcoming and lovely,
We had dinner on our first night ,breakfast two mornings all cooked to perfection
Rooms were comfortable and clean i must mention the snug where we spent a
lovely time after our evening meal (lovely Atmosphere)
Will certainly be staying there again and look forward to seeing the finishing touches
to the makeover.",5,2017,10,07
235,Sue Mc,"Very good hotel, their shuttle picked us up from the airport after the bus from Belfast, flew out early next morning. The staff were very helpful with shuttle timing and the Irish Stew in the restaurant was fantastic, very comfortable and clean. Would stay here again but stay longer and spend more time looking around Dublin.",5,2017,10,04
235,Not at the airport despite the name,"To begin with, the hotel is a good 15 minute taxi ride from the airport (about a 15 euro ride). The hotel does have a shuttle that runs every half hour but they charge 5 euros per person. To be sure you make your flight, make your shuttle reservation with time to spare, because if one of your fellow guests is late, the shuttle will be too.

The hotel is being remodeled and our room was spotlessly clean and appeared brand new. A glitch or two exist in the new design, however. The toilet is so close to the heated towel rack on the wall that long legged people cannot sit straight, but rather must sit at an awkward angle.

There is no air conditioning in the rooms so opening the window on the noisy street is a summertime must. Even that breath of cool air is compromised by rain showers. They will loan you a small electric fan which provided some relief.

The restaurant fare was pretty tasty, but despite the fact that the public areas do have air conditioning, it was not working because of the construction.

Americans should consider bringing your own wash cloth, because like many European hotels, they do not provide them. As bath soap, they provide only Euro-style liquid hair and body wash. I assume it is because of the conditioner contained in the liquid washing concoction, but, unlike the liquid hand soap at the sink, this stuff is almost impossible to rinse off.

The surrounding neighborhood appears blighted, with boarded-up retail space for sale across the street and elsewhere in the area.

This place is not outstanding in any way.",3,2017,10,02
235,Okay for one night,"Stayed one night before early morning flight. Check in didn't give good vibes as clerk acted like we were a bother, rooms have no air conditioning and very noisy with window open.  Was surprised their hotel shuttle charged to take you to the airport.  Would not stay again.",3,2017,09,27
235,OK for one night-- just barely,"Stayed here for one night because we had an early flight the next morning and it's not too far from the airport. The hotel shuttle was the best thing about this place. Other than its proximity to DUB, there's nothing much to recommend it. Room was adequate, but nothing special. Front desk staff was adequate, but nothing special. Restaurant was absolutely dreadful-- mediocre (at best), overpriced, microwaved food served by an incompetent wait staff. The neighborhood is not one in which you wish to wander. But, if you have to catch an early flight, it's OK for one night... I guess.",2,2017,09,24
235,airport hotel,"good nights sleep it has all you need for a airport hotel as you say you get what you pay for so no surprises but pleaseent 
we did not stay so long as we are on the red eye buy its comfrotable but if we ever return to dubklin and the airport we will certainly check you guys out",3,2017,09,23
235,Great for an airport one-night stop over,"Having been on business in the City all day I just needed a hotel close to Dublin airport for my early departure the following day.  

I have to be honest, I chose this hotel on price as my usual DUB hotels were for some reason double what I would normally pay.

I took the number 4 bus from the city and it was a fairly easy (35min-rush hour) journey out to this location.

Warm welcome from the staff at check-in and again a smiling greeting from the front desk and (I assume) the GM as I left the following morning at 6.30am for the airport.

Room was very clean and had all the amenities that I wanted for my overnight stay.

Walls a little thin as my sleep was disturbed by next door who must have arrived at 2.15am and thought nothing of chatting loudly and banging around. Not the hotel's fault but I am amazed at my fellow travellers behaviour at times. 

I can’t comment on the bar/restaurant as ate in the City before arrival and left before breakfast started at 7.00am.

Shuttle to the airport (five euro o/w) was well organised, or time and the driver friendly. 

Nothing much around the hotel and the area did seem rather run down. Even the convenience store over the road had closed and was boarded up. 

For a one night stay I would certainly look at returning.  For anything longer I think I would look elsewhere as the surrounding location wasn’t for me.",5,2017,09,17
235,Excellent short stay hotel,Spent one night here on arrival from North America before commencing Irish road trip. Clean with comfy king bed and modern bathroom. Good breakfast with choice of continantal or full cooked. Friendly and helpful staff. Extra accomodating for early checkin after a long night of travel. Shuttle from and back to airport. A real deal. Convenient city bus to centre just outside the door. 10 out of 10!,5,2017,09,15
235,Very convenient park and fly hotel.,"This is probably the most convenient hotel for sleeping and parking the car close to Dublin airport. The car park costs 4€ per day and it is cheaper to book it together with the room on the hotel's website. The shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport costs 2€ per person and the return journey to the hotel is free. Obviously you can also book the car park only without the room but you cannot do it on the website, you need to call the hotel. I really recommend the restaurant of the hotel: really delicious! I have become an usual guest of Metro hotel for some years now.",5,2017,09,11
235,"Good location, but was under renovation","We stayed here one night, just prior to flying out of Dublin. Overall, location is excellent, very close drive to the airport. However I will say, that the hotel felt to be in not the best part of town, and we were a little worried leaving our car in an uncovered spot out front. They did assure us that there is security present which helped. The front desk staff was EXTREMELY kind, and we are so grateful. I wish I knew the name of the girl who helped us so I could thank her directly, but she was very pleasant and helpful. The room was small but very nice and clean overall. same with the bathroom, I had no complaints about that. My only complaint is the the overall impression of the hotel wasn't too impressive, but i think it is because they're in the process of renovating it, so it didn't really appear too  impressive. The restaurant was also quite bare, and didn't have a wall painted, but the service was excellent and the food was actually pretty good. Overall, I think for the price it is an excellent choice close to the airport.",4,2017,09,05
235,"Clean, friendly staff, convenient to airport","Would definitely stay in this hotel again if traveling to/from Dublin Airport. Our room was a suite, with separate kitchenette, dining and seating area. The bathroom and bedroom were large and comfortable. Plenty of space for large amounts of luggage if needed. Everywhere was spotless. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was very quiet and it was only a 5 minute drive to the airport terminal. ",5,2017,09,04
235,Never,"Had book thos hotel because of its location .... week before i was to travel i tried to reserve parkibg for the 5 nights i was going to be away . On the website it told me it was unavaulable for these dates . 
I emailed the hotel explaining my situation to them ..with me being a customer rhat was actually staying in thw hotel would there be any form of an arrangement that could be made for us . 
Not one care was givibg by tge owrsin who emaiked me back . Basically the car park is full tough !!!! 
Customer service was no where to be found 

Will never stay here ",1,2017,09,03
235,One night stay but exceptionally well looked after by Sean,"The hotel was used because  of its location to airport .
From the moment we arrived At reception Sean went above and beyond to meet our every request and answer every question. Sean gave us lots of tips about the Area which made our very brief stay even more enjoyable
The hotel room was very nice and very clean with an excellent king size bed and a lovely bathroom and shower, 
The negative was that the bedroom was SO hot and stuffy it made sleeping difficult there was little ability to open the windows wide enough to get in fresh air, ( it really needed some  aircon)
The star of this stay was Sean and I hope the Metro Hotel recognises what a gem they have.",4,2017,08,28
235,Park fly stay,Rooms lovely and clean. Had evening snack and drink in bar it was fab and my waiter top class. I booked park fly and stay and has a bit of confusion on pick up time but was told take a taxi and they paid for it. Excellent service would definitely stay again.,5,2017,08,27
235,NICE CHEAP HOTEL,"This is our second stay at the Metro, as we had a flight out to Canada the following morning.The hotel is lovely and clean, although it was undergoing renovations at the time. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the staff were very accommodating.",5,2017,08,25
235,Return from foreign holiday,Checked into here aug 17 parked car in underground car park as arranged was told that the bus would be available when I came back to Dublin airport aug 23 explained my flight back was due to land 2245 was told just to ring hotel as bus ran all the time.landed back 23 aug after being delayed rang hotel to be told tough luck get a cab.had to wait for can 4 delayed flights all landed around same time got to hotel and night desk clerk actually said good morning as it was after 1 checked in and checked out later at 9 was very disappointed with noise of drills and nail guns.shower head wouldn't stay up high.explained wasn't happy about bus but was more or less told sorry shouldn't have been told that figuring out hotel is definitely a work in progress so while they are doing it up with might also invest in Windows to block out street noise,3,2017,08,24
235,Average,"The metro hotel is 10 minutes drive from Dublin airport. The rooms are tiny but clean. The bathroom is old, the shower has not curtain and the sink is very small and low. It is impossible to use it! The light in one of the elevators was not working. ",3,2017,08,22
235,"Excellent, clean hotel very convenient to airport","We were pleased to stay at the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport on the night before leaving on a morning flight. It was clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. We would certainly elect to stay there again,",5,2017,08,22
235,LITTLE OR NO SECURITY!,"While Dublin Airport is quickly and easily accessed from the hotel, I definitely won’t be staying at the Metro Hotel again anytime soon.

My husband and I stayed here for its 'convenience' the night before flying to Toronto, Canada en route to Barbados for our honeymoon. I briefly left my husband at the hotel’s bar while I went outside to make a phone call. As noisy youths were immediately outside the reception/lobby area, I moved around the corner – all the while remaining with my back, more or less, to one of the hotel’s outside walls. While here, presumably, one of the noisy youths rapidly ran up to me and snatched my iPhone 6S from the hand which was holding it to my ear.

I reported the mugging to the hotel receptionist who was having a conversation with someone who appeared to be the hotel's security guard. Indeed, if this is so, he presumably should have been standing vigilantly outside the door and not casually chatting to the receptionist indoors. However, once I explained where I was standing at the time of the incident, the receptionist and/or 'security guard' assured me that it would have been captured on CCTV. The receptionist then proceeded to ring the local Police Station. Eventually (following two or three calls from the hotel), two police officers met me back at the bar and took my details.

Surely, considering that the hotel is situated in what is undoubtedly one of Ireland’s most notorious crime-ridden-locations, the management should be in no doubt that having security personnel patrolling the hotel at all times is of paramount importance.

On a positive not, the hotel is very well maintained. Also, it would be remiss of me not to mention the bartender on duty on the evening in question – he was fantastic. Indeed, he is an incredible asset to the hotel.",2,2017,08,21
235,Very poor hotel in a grotty part of town,"We stayed for three nights and are used to staying in a variety of hotels but this place fails on so many counts.

We arrived to find extensive renovations underway. We had no pre-warning this was going to happen during our stay and feel a little duped in this respect. The bar/restaurant/reception were all affected and it felt like we were staying on a  building site. We would not have booked had we known the extent of works.

We paid for breakfast on the first day but it was ruined by the building work going on so we didn't bother again.

The location is fine for airport accessibility but anyone looking for more than that will be really disappointed. It is on the outskirts of the City which was a good 45 min drive away and is surrounded by poor quality housing and closed down shops. There were youths loitering about outside the hotel late into the night leaving us a bit worried about the security if the hire car. There were no pubs or anything else to hold your attention within walking distance and we really felt we missed out on any sense of staying in Dublin. 

As this is an airport hotel, there was excessive noise all night as people were arriving and departing for the airport, so don't stay here if you are looking for a peaceful night's sleep.

Rooms were fairly standard fare but are looking tired with paint flaking off the doors and dirty grout between shower tiles. Our shower tray filled up within a couple of minutes as it failed to drain away meaning we had to keep turning the shower off to avoid flooding the bathroom.

Wifi was good but TV was shockingly limited.Bed was large and comfortable.

Final insult for us was that on one night the boiler broke down leaving us with no hot water for a shower. This should never happen in a  modern hotel and smacks of poor maintenance and/or planning. Reception staff were unhelpful and no apology was offered at any stage.

Took these issues up with the manager on departure and again, we received no apology or even any sense of contrition. He just offered a 10% discount on one night's stay and suggested we write in to complain where we might get an additional response. This is missing the point entirely. We weren't after a discount or some other pay off - just a reasonably decent hotel for a fair price.We won't be writing a complaint but just hope this review serves as a warning to would-be customers.",1,2017,08,21
235,Never again....worst hotel I have ever stayed in,"The hotel is not as the pictures depict....firstly the hotel is under renovations which I wasn't advised of during the booking....the reception area has wires and cables hanging everywhere...the bar area just has hard chairs and tables and would not entice you to stay for a drink or food.

The room was fine...bed not that comfy at all...the breakfast time was absolutely disgraceful...on arrival to the bar for breakfast it was the most unprofessional setup that we have ever seen ....and we travel a lot...we had to wait 15 mins for any type of hot food and when I asked the breakfast manager what the problem was he was extremely rude and obnoxious and spoke to me as if I was a piece of dirt.   I did complain at the front desk and at check out we were refunded the price of the breakfast (22 euro) .

I had paid 181 euro for the hotel for the night as a trip for my husbands birthday..it wasn't even worth €50 per night.  

I do understand that hotels need upgrading but they need to make the guests aware of it and managers should NOT speak to guests the way I was spoken to.

The only nice people we met in the hotel where the lady and gentleman on reception.

I will never ever stay at this hotel again and I would definitely not recommend that any of our friends, family or colleagues stay here",2,2017,08,15
235,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at hotel the night before we flew out to Paris.  Left Car at hotel and collected it on way back from Holidays.
Staff were very helpful, friendly, both in evening and in the morning.
Room were lovely and big but the sofa beds were not great to sleep on.
Have dinner in restaurant when we returned. Very Good Food Was Lovely.",5,2017,08,14
235,Unpleasant & Frustrating,"My experience with this hotel was at the very least unpleasant and frustrating. I would be cautious of booking with this hotel if I was a business traveler or a family as they may not honor your reservation (something essential for a hotel located next to a major travel hub). The hotel was not as depicted in images on their website with stray cables hanging down at reception and finishes not completed. Staff were rude and unprepared to deal with enforcing the policies set in place by the hotel management.

When you make a reservation at this establishment beware of the information in your confirmation regarding the fact they may authorize your credit card before your stay and if they have any issues they can and will cancel your reservation. On the day of my reservation at 12:17pm an email was sent to me saying they had an issue with my credit card by 6:40pm they had canceled my reservation. The only issue was during that whole time period I was traveling with no access to my cell phone or Internet. If they had attempted the charge 24-48 hours before I would have had the opportunity to update my information and ensure that my credit card was working correctly (after review of what caused the issue post visit once I got access to my cell/internet it was a flagged charge as it was a large international purchase, something that could happen to anyone). This left my family with 2 small kids ages 2 and 5 at 9:30pm with no place to stay at the end of our journey. Staff were rude and condescending and completely insensitive to our situation. They did eventually assist us with finding a room at another hotel but that was after we put a lot of pressure on them. The room was not the same type of accommodation and was a high rate for what it was as it was booked the same day. We ended a long day of travel at a very late time tired and uncomfortable. Not a situation i would wish on anyone else.

I understand why the hotel would want to confirm a credit card before hand, however, the way this policy was administered in our case was very unfortunate for us as a guest and left us with little to no options to remedy the issue. 6 hours on the day of a reservation is not enough time to give the guest to make sure all is in order before canceling a room (especially as an airport hotel where people are traveling internationally). Perhaps giving guests a 48 hour window or encouraging guests to leave 2 credit cards on file to alleviate this issue with policy? The assistant manager indicated that this happens all the time so it would seem to be a problem that others have experienced.

I understand hotels have the right to administer their own policies, however they wish. I just wouldn't want others to stay at a hotel with such unsympathetic staff and policies that aren't customer friendly and experience what I did. This is not an inexpensive hotel and from what I saw of the building and my interactions with staff there are much nicer places to stay at the same cost level.",1,2017,08,14
235,Beautiful & accomodating,"Loved my short stay at the Metro Hotel. Only there for one night upon arriving and one night a week later before leaving but very much enjoyed it. Food was good, people were very charming and accomodating, even helpful with the best places to visit in Dublin during my stay. The room was very beautiful and clean (both times), and I love the energy-saving techno they have going with the lights in the rooms and the hallways. Absolutely no complaints.
NB had difficulty with wifi but being aware that wifi is pretty bad generally everywhere in Ireland, I was not at all disappointed. It is to be expected in most places. And it is not a necessity.",5,2017,08,08
235,Good Value!,"So, after my week in the fabulous city of Amsterdam I had the metro booked just for a night as we were back late and live 4 hours from the airport... on arrival at 9.30pm there was a few issues with my card... which shocked me. Initially the lady behind the desk came across irritated that my card was being declined & I had quite a bit of money in my account so couldn't understand the issue, I chose to call my bank and the issue was sorted very quickly. When I explained to the lady behind reception she discovered it was actually a fault on the behalf of herself and could not apologise enough, she was so so apologetic and sorted everything quickly. She gave us complimentary parking. We had requested a late check out initially, just 30 minutes & were willing to pay but the lady kindly allowed us stay until 2pm free of charge. I felt that she rectified the issue and accepted it was her fault in such a polite manner. 
We stayed in 222 which was a suite. The room, what can I say, gorgeous! It had a real homely feel to it & there was not a speck of dirt anywhere. The cleaning staff deserve serious recognition as for a three star this hotel is better than some five stars I've stayed in! I could have eaten off the floor it was that clean. 
One issue we discovered was that the sink was blocked but it didn't affect our stay much, the water just took a bit of time to go down the sink, not worth complaining over! 
The bar food was okay... I'm a big pasta lover and ordered penne with chicken, sauce & veg. I ate most of it but the actual dish tasted of vegetable soup, for me anyway, less veg more pasta would have been great, but hey, everyone has their own likes. 
Unfortunately for us we stayed while the hotel is being ""done up"" so some bits were a bit of a mess, so we'd like to return to see it when it's been fully made over! 
Also, the bed, totally comfortable, didn't want to leave it! 
Something else I found interesting which I haven't seen in many hotels was low hangars and extra railings for the shower. It appeared that these were for people maybe in wheelchairs or something and we just felt that it was really nice to see a hotel being inclusive of everyone. 
It's great value for money also! 
Would recommend ",3,2017,08,07
235,Very nice Hotel,"A lovely hotel the cost is very good. Inside is a bar and restaurant with good food. A spacious room, free WiFi. A good place to stay if you want to be close to city centre near Dublin. And close to the airport 
",5,2017,08,07
235,convenient to airport,"Hotel is under renovation, but didn't interfere with stay. Rooms are clean but on small side. No A/C but they did provide a fan as it was warm. There is a shuttle from the airport but they charge 5 Euros for a round trip, which was fine but it wasn't advertised that there was a charge. Was first hard to find where shuttle picks you up and it is a short walk from the airport. Staff are friendly and very helpful and accommodating. Restaurant in the hotel is good; the breakfast is an additional charge from the room. There are no other restaurants or stores near the hotel as it is more of a residential area. Overall, stay was comfortable and convenient for our purposes.",4,2017,08,04
235,Great Hotel,I've been staying here since June and have to say it's brilliant. Kate and the team work hard to ensure that we are happy. Food is good value and well cooked. Taylor in the Restaurant is super enthusiastic and always working hard. Shuttle bus to airport is handy. Have used other hotels around here this is the best by miles. 5 stars. Well done guys!,5,2017,08,03
235,Great place to stay close to the airport!,"The room was very clean, comfortable and spacious. The main reason I stayed there was because of its location. The hotel has a service that brings you to and from the airport at no charge. They are very punctual.",4,2017,08,01
235,Always Helpful and Understanding,Once again we had the pleasure of staying at the Metro and once again the staff was excellent. Our luggage did not arrive for three days and the front desk did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable. They constantly helped us contact the luggage department and even brought us to the airport three times so we could check on our luggage. The shuttle bus driver was fabulous and even let us borrow some of his sports equipment so we could enjoy a game of golf near the hotel. Our room was perfect and every effort was made to make sure we were content and comfortable. Back there again next year for sure!!!,5,2017,07,25
235,Great deal,"Stayed here for an early flight . Lovely and modern and perfect for early flight. Left car here for 5 nights also and it's cost approx  80 euros including the night !, we had to stay abroad for an extra night due to unforeseen circumstances and I emailed hotel about car and extra night. They were fantastic and responded straight away with no extra charge for the night,will stay again. Book directly through their website for a better deal.",5,2017,07,23
235,Good choice for outbound travelers,"newly refurbished rooms.  A bit noisy, but proximity to Dublin airport makes up for it.
Full service restaurant. Wide choices on menu.  Full breakfast or Continental breakfast available at reasonable prices.",5,2017,07,20
235,Decent place near the airport,"Located only 10 min from the airport, and a shuttle available to get you there and back. On arrival the check in was easy and fast, we let them know we needed a shuttle back in the morning, so they wrote our names on a list. 
The room was a little bit on the tiny side, the dresser drawer opened and hit the bed before it could be opened all the way. Its a little inconvenient when the blow dryer was attached to inside of that drawer. Just a weird set up, we had to put the room key in a slot in order for the lights in the room/bathroom would come on. Just a small room overall, had to jump over the bed to get back and fourth with 2 people in it along with 2 large suite cases.
Dining area is large and it was very busy that night, the service was still very good. It was already late so we didn't try any food, only dessert. We ended up bringing our second drinks to our room.",4,2017,07,18
235,Decent place near airport,"This hotel is very near to airport and I guess that's like their main advantage. Hotel staff was courteous and friendly. They upgraded/changed the room when requested. Breakfast was good and had decent spread. Rooms were spacious, clean and almost newly furnished. One drawback was that they don't have mini bar in their rooms. This hotel is far from city centre and it takes good 40 min to reach there. This hotel is good for the people who wish to stay near airport.",3,2017,07,17
235,Metro,Very nice hotel. Very clean and room was spacious. Breakfast in the morning was basic however was nice. Overall good experience. Buses into town 2 minute walk. Shuttle bus on request to and from Dublin airport which proved very handy. ,4,2017,07,17
235,Try the bistro,Had an overnight stay. Room was a bit small but very clean and had everything you need. Dinner in the bistro was excellent. All staff very friendly and helpful. Car park facilities very handy and courtesy bus to the airport.,4,2017,07,17
235,Great staff and sevice,"Stayed here last week before early flight the next day. Really enjoyed it as staff so pleasant and helpful, from reception to bar staff and the bus driver who brings you to and from hotel to the airport. Had a lovely dinner in the bistro with a very relaxing atmosphere. Best hotel food we have ever had so compliments to the chef! Room was very comfortable with great bed and spotless bathroom. Tv has best reception ever and WiFi is fast. Got a great deal for stay and parking for the week. Will be back next time we are flying and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,16
235,Krystel was wonderful!!!,"Krystel found us a great room, helped us arrange a shuttle, directions to airport, really appreciate that she understands family. She was patient, kind, and helpful. I have already recommended to friends flying into and out of Dublin.
Thank you for a great stay!!! We will definitely be back!
",5,2017,07,14
235,The service on the lounge/restaurant is awesome!,"I had an overnight at the Metro Hotel to catch an early morning flight. I needed dinner, and the service there in the restaurant and lounge is fantastic! Waiter Mario and bartender Taylor were professional, efficient and friendly.

 I had time to sit at the bar after dining and had some nice conversation. It gave me a good impression of the hotel, and that the management was hiring good employees. If I ever need to overnight again near the Dublin airport, Metro will definitely be my choice!",5,2017,07,12
235,anne,"very helpful staff, security gentleman was informative and was willing to answer any queries i had, could not fault hotel, parking was easy and I felt my car was safe outside hotel. Room was clean and comfortable",5,2017,07,11
235,Night before flying out.,Stayed here before flying out to Bulgaria for a family holiday. Rooms were really comfortable and spacious.  Was so comfortable and staff were so friendly. Breakfast was really good and an excellent price. Would definitely recommend it.,5,2017,07,11
235,Excellent Service,Used parking space for airport & shuttle bus to Dublin airport. Driver of mini bus excellent!  He is always so helpful with bags and children.  Always so friendly and recognises us from previous trips.  He is a credit to the hotel and he is the reason we return time after time. ,5,2017,07,11
235,Over night stay,"Enjoyed my over night stay from start to finish after my holiday
On entering the hotel was greeted by most efficient friendly staff,got to the room and discovered the bed situation was not for me ,it was late at night and the reception staff changed the room immediately 
Greeted in the dining room next morning ,beautiful freshly cooked breakfast 
Overall appearance of the hotel was lovely and very comfortable,very happy with my stay",5,2017,07,11
235,Excellent staff,"Amazing to get such excellent service and this was from ALL the staff: reception staff, secruity men at the entrance door, airport taxi man, restaurant and bar staff. Spacious rooms, great showers, coffee provided at 4am before going to the airport, lovely cooked breakfast, nice pub food/restaurant menu and we spent a relaxing time in the lounge watching some TV in the afternoon. For such a high quality hotel they've managed to make you feel at home. Will definitely be our hotel of choice next time. We got a free parking space right outside the door;-)",5,2017,07,10
235,Superb staff.,"Could not complain about the helpfulness of staff, all very friendly and willing to do everything in their power to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Shuttle bus to the airport was also a very nice service which was ontime.",5,2017,06,27
235,Nice hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night as a layover in Dublin. It was clean, the beds comfortable. Staff were very friendly. It is about a 10 min bus ride (stop is right outside of hotel) to downtown. The hotel also offers an airport transfer shuttle at a cost of 4 euro. 
There is a restaurant in the hotel that looked quite nice, but we never did eat in it.
I would recommend this hotel.",4,2017,06,25
235,Airport Hotel,"We decided to stay in a hotel as our flight from Frankfurt was in late and we did not feel up to traveling to Cork. As the Metro was the cheapest we could find and our usual hotel did not have a bed for us we booked the Metro.
We were very pleased from reception to room to breakfast. Staff were friendly and efficient. They offer a good choice of menu at a reasonable price.",5,2017,06,18
235,Okay for one night,"A hotel that is located in not a great area of the city. Ten minutes from the airport and that's why we chose it and it was less expensive than others. The person (I think it was Samantha) at the reception desk was matter of fact and not very friendly, no smile, no engagement, but was just doing her job and nothing more. Kind of made you feel like she was doing you a favor. We booked a deluxe twin room which turned out to be a regular very small room with a shower only.  They wanted another 20€ for an upgrade and it was said ""with an attitude.""  Clean enough but not very big. Okay place for one night- in and out. Would not stay longer. We tried to cancel our reservation 24 hours ahead and they would not allow it. One thing that was good was that the restaurant, Bistro 9, had very good food and Patrenella did not disappoint. Very friendly and nice and even has us traveling to Romania in September. We had the calamari, stuffed chicken, baked cod in a wonderful dill sauce and a brownie with ice cream and we polished off a bottle of wine. So that's all good. Shuttle to the airport is prepaid at 5€ p.p.  I would not stay here again but I would definitely have lunch or dinner here. Had no issues with Wifi. ",3,2017,06,17
235,Great bed,"Was only a short stop as in Dublin for one day. The shuttle bus from airport was easy to find and on time. Booked early check in. Room wasn't quite ready but after 10 mins it was. 
First impression of bedroom was 'WOW' what a big bed !  
The room was clean and tea coffee available. We used Uber into the centre of city but as we found out it's a lot cheaper to use a taxi. 
 The short time we spent in the room was very comfortable and would use again. Staff were pleasant and helpful too. ",5,2017,06,15
235,Restaurant Bistro 9,"Excellent service. Petronela was really nice, professional and helpful. Fast service and friendly. Especially for hungry and tired people like us. And the food was tasty and good.
Thank you. Great experience.",5,2017,06,13
235,Didn't feel welcomed at all,"The initial reception was unwelcoming. The front desk staff wasn't friendly. But, a quick check-in. FYI. Keep your receipt if you paid for a taxi for they reimburse you. 
The room was really small, but overall okay. The pot to heat water for coffee wasn't that clean. 
Dylan, the host in the restaurant was AWESOME! Very friendly and lovely. He's even made a great impression on my 8 year old son. Said. ""That guy is so nice!"" So, kudos!! 
I would stay again if it was my last option. Just didn't feel welcome w/ the front desk attitude.",3,2017,06,12
235,"Wonderful staff, economical hotel","This is not a 4 star hotel, that being said, the rooms are small, the beds were comfortable, parking was 4 Euros for the whole day, the hotel will hold your bags for free, the breakfast buffet was very good and the staff was very, very kind.
Tomek, the reception staff, shuttle driver ( who took me to departure area), could not have been more helpful.  The quirks of having to insert your key for electricity, the crazy shower,odd room sizes all add to the European flavor.
It is not an American hotel.
And the Guinness and Jameson were the best!",3,2017,06,10
235,Out of the crazy city centre.,"If you don't need to be in Dublin city centre, but need a place to sleep 10 minutes from the airport, this is your place. 
Clean, good size rooms, friendly staff and a great restaurant/bar.
Special mention to Joseph our waiter who was fantastic. He made our meal a great experience. 
Most hotels near airports are soulless and the staff robotic. Not the case here.
Well done guys!",4,2017,06,09
235,Not professionals,"I can only start with the good points.
1. Chatty shuttle bus driver. Irish are definitely ice breakers. Very welcoming.
2. Big bed.
3. Decent food (but not great)

And ... that's it.

The rest is downhills...

I left the room for my meetings posting the ""pls clean my room"" label. Came back 8 hours later and guess... nothing. When I complained to the reception they came up with a lame excuse.

Unorganized... the night before check out I had asked to settle the remaining of my account so that I would not have to do it early in the morning. I got myself doing this twice (once in that evening and the morning after). And it was not because I added something to the bill in between.

The area is not ideal. Ballymun is not the place to walk alone in the evening.
",2,2017,06,09
235,Parking only ,"Best parking in Dublin airport area so far!! We are traveling from Dublin quite often during years and always traveling from Northern Ireland by car. This was best value for money so we decided to book online- 6days cost us 23€+ 2€/person for shuttle bus. As we arrived we have been told that we just missed the shuttle bus, but Hotel organized taxi - we still payed 2€ pp!! I know that taxi fare was nearly 20€ but we had to pay 4€ as per bus fare only! unfortunately 1st time in 10 years flying we missed the flight!! I have contacted hotel immediately to make them aware of the situation and ask them if it's okay for car to stay in underground parking and also what would be the additional cost. They replied within 2 hours and told us not to worry and there's no additional cost for parking! what a great company!! When we arrived bus came within 10mins and there was no bus fee when returning. We would recommend this parking to all friends and we will definitely keep the hotel in mind. Thank you for great service Metro Hotel",5,2017,06,05
235,Unexpectedly Wonderful!,"From the shuttle driver who picked us up at the airport at 11:45 pm and kept us entertained all the way to the hotel, to the man at the desk who upgraded our room, to the spacious, comfortable, lovely room with every possible convenience,  to the shuttle driver who took us back to the airport, this was an incredible experience!  This WILL be the only place we stay when we are in Dublin and we will be back again soon.  THANK YOU!!!  Wish there were more stars to give.",5,2017,06,05
235,Excellent airport hotel,"Stayed here night before a family trip away. Got complimentary bus from airport with friendly driver :) 
Found all staff accommodating and v friendly.
Room smallish but spotless and modern. Bathroom amazing!
Will definitely be back ",5,2017,06,05
235,A Good Place to Sleep,"Nothing special about this place.  FYI: early check in is not free, and they do have a shuttle bus. They tell you you catch the bus, but be prepared to walk a 1/2 mile.  Taxis charge 4£ just to pick you up.  Estimate 20£ for a taxi into Downtown Dublin.  ",3,2017,06,03
235,Enjoyable meal,"The room was clean and nicely decorated, the bathroom was also clean with a large shower, if you are looking for the hairdryer check out the drawer below the dressing table. There is a kettle coffee and tea in the room.
The check in/ out staff were very pleasant, as were the restaurant staff. I don't know if they have it on all the time but we had a lovely 2 course meal for 15:95 Euro each. The menu is very good and even if there is no special the prices are good. We were only there 1 night to pick up a friend from the airport early the next morning.  The room did get a little warm through the night, but all together a very good hotel. Rooms also have ports for your own computer.",5,2017,06,01
235,No air conditioning?!,"What a surprise when we got into our hot west facing room (with curtains wide open and the window closed) at about 5 pm to discover THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING! So beware if you are booking into this hotel in the summer. The staff were super responsive in changing us to a cooler east facing room, though. The rooms are clean and well designed. The bar & restaurant were excellent. And you can beat the proximity to the airport and a shuttle that runs every half hour starting at 4am.",3,2017,05,31
235,Ideal for early flight,"Basic hotel
But near airport and just off m50. Nice rooms and good value. Parking outside is limited enough but is free with room. You can get a shuttle service to the airport also. Staff were friendly ",4,2017,05,24
235,Terrific,Our trip to Dublin was terrific and the stay at the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport made it  complete. The room are clean but the service at Bistro 9 made our stay absolutely perfect. The lady named Petronella in the restaurant is top notch!!!! She is very friendly and always smiling. I would recommend her for a member of a team at any facility!!!!,5,2017,05,24
235,Great service! ,From the moment we walked in the door the friendliness of the front desk staff to the cleanliness of the room; we were extremely pleased. And the service in Bistro 9 restaurant was excellent- Petronela is AWESOME!!!! The food was most tasty as well !  ,4,2017,05,24
235,Excellent night sleep ,Friendly hotel with shuttle bus to airport (€5 return). I had a 4th floor room and a great night sleep (worth diamonds to me!). Staff (from the bus driver to reception and bistro staff were friendly and helpful. Will be using this hotel again,4,2017,05,24
235,"Fine, but misleading information... no free shuttle bus on going to airport","In Booking.com it says the hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, but that's not true. Is not free if you are going TO the airport, it's 5€/person. It is free only FROM the airport. And the other thing it doesn't say is that the service stops at midnight. When we arrived (before midnight) the shuttle was not working forother reasons, and they told us on the phone to take a taxi and that it would be refunded, which they did. When we checked-in they asked if we needed the shuttle TO the airport the next morning and then they charged 10€ (2 persons) for it in our credit card but without mentioning it, so we kept thinking the shuttle was free. A bit of our fault for not checking the bill.
On the return from our trip we stayed there again. We arrived after midnight so we had to get a taxi and paid 16€ for the 2 mile ride. I had called before to ask about the shuttle time tables, and the receptionist told me that there was no bus at that time, but to take a taxi and ask for a receipt and “maybe the manager can try to do something about it” (her own words). The didn't reimburse us. We talked to the manager, he was very nice about it, told us that they try their best to keep the bus running as long as possible, but that the policy of the hotel was not to refund anything unless it was during the normal shuttle hours, and that the receptionist should not have said that to me. So, surprise surprise, we had to pay another 10€ for the return to the airport. So, in total, 36€ shuttle cost.
Apart from that, the hotel was very nice, the room was clean and modern. We stayed for one night each time. Everything was fine except the shuttle. The food was good, best chicken wings in a long time. Personnel was friendly and helpful. Location is near the airport, that's why we used it. It was a bit expensive but for the location it was ok.",3,2017,05,22
235,Fantastic ,"We stayed here night before our holiday I found it to be excellent value as it also included our parking for two weeks .., the food was top class and the staff are excellent . When we arrived we got upgraded to a suite which was very much appreciated as we had a baby so the extra space made our stay very comfortable.  Also what I think was good our stay included our dinner and we could choose 3 courses from al a carte menu and not like other hotels where the meal would be limited to a set menu.  I travel a lot and I will definitely be returning here in the future before my holidays thank you for making our stay very enjoyable ",5,2017,05,22
235,THE GUINNESS,"The shuttle bus was handy and on time, the room was lovely, the restaurant and bar area were lovely, the meal we had was top notch. I looked forward to a pint of ARTHUR in Dublin bur it was awful in this establishment.",4,2017,05,21
235,It was a very enjoyable visit the hotel,"Stay here on fri 12th may for one night and the car for 4 days, the hotel was a excellent location from the airport, the food was very good and so was the vegetarian dishes the room was very spacious with comfortable bed, we were transferred to the airport in the morning on time and pick on the way back 4 days later by min bus, the staff were very good and helpful and specially the security that took you to the underground car park for your car, i would  recommend to friends.",5,2017,05,19
235,afternoon in the metro hotel,It was a very enjoyable visit the hotel is very central  very clean staff very courtious and very helpfull food excellant  nothing was too much trouble for them  a very enjoyable visit  I would recomend it to all my friends  plenty to do locally shopping easy acess to town plently of busses passing the door,5,2017,05,18
235,Would recommend ,"The staff are second to none, they went above and beyond to make our stay an enjoyable one. The rooms where a good size and spotless, the breakfast was lovely and well worth the money. Such a great atmosphere. would definitely return ",5,2017,05,10
235,Good choice for us,"We stayed here because we were looking for separate rooms and something nicer than dorms that you get in Dublin city. Service was good and friendly, buses take you into town and back until around 11 pm and there's also a bus stop just outside to go to the dart and then to the coast. Rooms good, just the shower could have been better. Breakfast was OK,not awesome though. It wasn't the cheapest we could have got but Dublin is expensive and in town there were only dorms available for a reasonable price... ",4,2017,05,08
235,Recent stay with Metro Hotel Dublin Airport,"We had an excellent overnight stay when we travelled out for the country, last week.
The accommodation & cleanliness was of a high standard. The food in the resturant could be better. The staff were very professional and friendly.",5,2017,05,08
235,Homeward Bound,"Pleasant staff/drivers, updated bathrooms, nice rooms.  Could hear guests in next door room but, fortunately, they were quiet. Nice to have the aurport bus available so frequently. Would visit again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2017,05,07
235,Huge disappointment ,"I am so disappointed with my experience here. The hotel, itself, is absolutely fine however the service really wasn't something I appreciated after travelling all day. I booked a room for 3people online however when I arrived I was told the booking was only made for two and so I would have to pay extra for the third person. Alongside this, we had to pay extra for the shuttle bus...I've never had to pay extra for a shuttle provided by an ""airport hotel"".  I apologise to my brother and his girlfriend for dragging them here! As a frequent flyer, I would be more than happy to pay the extra €20 to stay at the Clayton in future. ",1,2017,05,07
235,Comfortable hotel close to Dublin airport.,"We really enjoyed our stay at Metro hotel where we booked a triple room and 7 days car park for euros 133 including the shuttle service to the airport in the morning. We could not find a better price for a hotel close to the airport. We really recommend the restaurant of the hotel which is very good, especially the chicken supreme and the chicken wings. ",5,2017,04,26
235,Very cheap for the quality of everything,Fantastic spot! Staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful! The room was clean and modern. The restaurant surpassed all my expectations and then some. Driving is necessary when staying here but I knew that when booking as the location is a bit out. Stayed for a concert in the 3arena and was perfect.,5,2017,04,26
235,Metro Hotel review,I booked a double room. Compared to other hotels it is the smallest double room I have ever seen. Two people cannot walk past each othet in it. The bed takes up tue whole room nearly and there in only a little room to manouver. I opted to pay with two debit cards and the receptionist was very annoyed due to this. After the transaction went through he gave me the room card and that was it. He did not explain anything else and did not offer breakfast or dinner. I was prepared to buy breakfast and dinner in the hotel but that was money spent elswhere. Also when my girlfriend and I first arrived there was no parking space available. The carpark is tiny and I had to park it in a private spot from which I had to move it before 1pm the next day. While I was in the car trying to find a parking space my girlfriend went into the hotel to check us in. There were four men there in the reception area all crowded around her. There were two receptionists the security guard and one other random man. They stood all arpund her which made her very uncomfortable and seem like she was dodgy. Only after she told tje receptionist that I was outside they dispersed and gave her some space. She was very upset due to this. Oh and the parking is 4 euro per day for such a tiny car park. The only good thing was the view from the fourth floor.,1,2017,04,25
235,Montanan's Perspective,"Easy ride from Dublin Airport to the hotel via free shuttle bus.  $10 for two back to the airport.  Hotel a bit dated - but very clean rooms, bath, etc.  Hotel desk staff outstanding with assistance. Bar and restaurant okay.  Return visit - same type room not available so upgraded to a suite!  I certainly would recommend if you want to stay near Dublin Airport.",4,2017,04,25
235,Average room no heating,"The hotel is about 10 mins by taxi from the airport costing about €12. On arrival you notice the area isn't great and the hotels door are always locked meaning you have to ring a bell to gain access, that's a good clue to the area where a woman asked me for a euro when I walked to the near by store. 

The hotel is a small step up from a Travelodge. The bathroom is clean and modern but with a badly designed shower which ensures the flood gets covered in water. The toiletries are bottles attached to the wall both of which were old and clearly had been refilled so many times the pumps didn't work well. 

The TV was ok but a lot of channels didn't seem to work and could easily be fixed by updating and re-tuning the TV's, The bed was comfy and the the little wardrobe area with a kettle was well designed. The room had no heating controls at all so the little radiator was part of a central system and no AC existed, for a hotel in this price range these should be basics but Ireland has a lot of poor value hotels and this fairly new one didn't break with the tradition of doing things on the cheap. The room also lacked any sockets! None beside the bed, none on the desk that did have things plugged in and only one by the door of the room near the floor! This is a modern hotel and they even went cheap on plug sockets! It's not the 1950's people have things to charge at the very minimum the desk should have a couple of spare sockets and for it's age I would expect bedside ones. 

Breakfast was ok but the place was lifeless and had no ambiance. The food was average like everything else but the member of staff seemed friendly which was the only thing going for the place.   

I was due to stay 2 nights but canceled the second night and moved elsewhere.",3,2017,04,25
235,Loved our stay @ the Metro Hotel❤️,"My boyfriend & I stayed at the Metro Hotel last weekend and we loved every second of it! The food was fab on both mornings and evenings and the staff were very friendly, especially supervisor Petronela who served our table both evenings. She was fantastic, very efficient and always checking to make sure everything was okay for us. We don't often tip waitresses but we tipped her both nights because she really was brilliant! She always had a smile on her face☺Our room was upgraded to a suite when we arrived which was a nice surprise and the room was fab☺it was very spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable! The hotel is near Dublin Airport with a shuttle bus provided by the hotel and we were only 20 mins from the city centre by taxi. We will definitely be back here again soon! Loved it❤️",5,2017,04,25
235,No faff just as required,"The reception staff where lovely, restaurant food filled a hole on two occasions and the burger was spot on.

The room upgrade to suite was kind yet i consider a suite to be of royal standard which it is not but this does not distract from the most comfortable bed and pillows. The night watchman is a kindly and most helpful gentleman and all that was asked of staff was delivered.

Airport is 5 minutes so nice and close.

I am back in October so will definitely stay here again. The shower on full heat was divine something so simple yet so enjoyable.

Plain and simple yet most enjoyed.",5,2017,04,24
235,Miss,"Very near Dublin airport, room wasn't ready when we arrived but we got an upgrade and the suite was lovely. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food in the bistro was fabulous and very cheap, would definitely stay there again ",4,2017,04,23
235,Comfiest bed I have ever stayed in at a hotel ,"We are in Dublin this weekend for two nights staying at metro hotel airport. We got off our flight and went to zone 16 where we got picked up by the mini bus. They come every half an hour and take you to the hotel. It seems quite out the way from the centre and it is on a busy road but that didn't keep me awake. You get the number 4 bus from the bus stop that is 2 min walk, into Dublin centre get off at o'Connal street which takes around 25 mins. Buses run until about 23.30. Bus always seems to be late though! The hotel room is really nice we got upgraded to a corner room as it's my husbands 30th. It seems like a super king bed (we have one at home and seems the same size) it is really comfy! I would say the comfiest bed I have ever stayed in when not at home. It has a mini kitchen with a kettle, microwave, sink and fridge. Bathroom seems very clean. Did not hear and hotel noise just a bit of road traffic. On our way home we will be using the hotel mini bus back to the airport which costs €5 each on the way back to airport. All in all a great hotel. ",4,2017,04,23
235,Absolutely solid. ,"Had a very functional overnight. Online booking needed amending, in phono no issue, very slick. Arrrival v genuinely pleasant  and efficient . Room and jax bang on. Comfy bed. Great shower. The bar was serving food but Munster had lost and all I wanted was beer and needed was wifi. Both came easy. Petronella was a delight . Humming as she cleaned.I'd return for that!
Lovely to see a member of staff so excited about their forthcoming renovation project.
I needed a favour that was off the books and because the staff knew it was legit they delivered, Seamlessly. I will definitely return. 
Well done to Larry and all those staff that are younger, keep up the great job. ",5,2017,04,22
235,Quick stay ,"Stayed here in a suite for one night as we had an early morning flight and it was more then we expected, the room was lovely massive king bed, the room decor is very modern a tasteful, the shower room/toilet is massive. There was a separate sitting area and table with a kettle toaster and microwave. They give you proper mugs which I loved for a cuppa in the morning. The only thing I'd say is that they could do with the TV being in this sitting area instead of the bed room,But that could just be me each to their own. The other down side was the room was far too hot even with the heating off and all windows open it was too warm. 
The shuttle was €5 each to the airport as we weren't returning to get the discounted rate! But that didn't bother us. 
We had a few drinks in the bar it was nice and the service was good, the food looked nice but we had already ate. 

I would definitely return :) ",4,2017,04,22
235,Perfectly fine airport hotel,"We spent one night at the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport and thought it was a good value for the money.  It seems to be a little further from the airport than some of the airport hotels (took us 15 minutes to get there in the shuttle), but the employees were cordial, and the food in the restaurant was surprisingly good.  The bed was comfortable and it was quiet enough to sleep.  We would stay there again.",5,2017,04,19
235,Over night stay,"Stayed here overnight on the 29th march 2017,to catch connecting flight at Dublin airport the following day,I read reviews on this hotel and I was so impressed,rooms as discribed,shuttle bus to/from airport every 15 min for a small fee,the staff here are amazing nothing to much trouble and always polite and friendly wouldn't hesitate to stay here again",5,2017,04,10
235,Excellent hotel close to city center,"Cosy rooms, helpful staff, stylish bar and tasty food in the hotel restaurant. 
Bus stops are only a few meters from the hotel front door. It is very easy and cheep to take the bus to the city center. The hotel shuttle bus from and to the airport is a plus. ",5,2017,04,07
235,Helpful staff,"We recently had an unexpected stay at this hotel. On our family vacation to Spain, our daughter became ill on the plane. We needed to spend the next day in Dublin to make certain she was ok to continue on. We quickly made a reservation at this hotel which was relatively close to the airport.

 On check in, I spoke with Daniel, who was working at the front desk and asked for his help in getting my daughter to a doctor. (We needed the a note for the airline to let us continue our trip). Daniel  was extremely helpful- called several local GP offices and found someone close by who had an opening. Thankfully, my daughter probably over had a mild case of food poisoning. However, getting to see a physician in an office setting likely saved me a lot of time and money... I would have otherwise taken her to the Emergency Room. 

Our room was nice... Clean and very comfortable. There was rather a lot of road noise. Also, note there are not really any restaurants close by. It's more of a residential location with a lot of apartment complexes. That wasn't really an issue for us... We walked down the road and picked up some sandwiches at the grocery store for our dinner. Bus stop to downtown Dublin is close at hand. ",4,2017,04,05
235,Hotel excellent - Breakfast poor,"Arrived after midnight. The receptionist was a bit useless and didn't give us any information on breakfast times, or prices, or check out times.

The room however was great. The room was massive and was very clean and tidy.

Breakfast was a bit disappointing. It was not worth the money. There wasn't many pastries, the orange juice was warm, the bread was stale. It was one of the worst hotel breakfast's I have had.

Our stay here was great but the breakfast really let it down.

The bus into the city centre was easy and it isn't too far from the airport either.",4,2017,04,04
235,Misinformation galore,Promise of free glass of wine only works if you also order an overpriced meal of very average quality. Tried to get pickup from the airport but no one answered the phone so took taxi only to find out that it's quite some distance away. Last complaint is that a half empty water bottle was sitting next to the bed... obviously forgotten by the cleaners. I won't be staying again I'm afraid! ,1,2017,04,04
235,Great stay brilliant staff,"Had a two night stay and couldn't praise this hotel enough. The staff were excellent from the greeting by the receptionist on arrival to the bar and waiting staff, even the shuttle bus driver was great. Ate in the bistro both nights, the food was very good and very reasonably priced. The bar staff couldn't do enough to help you and were very pleasant.
I would definitely stay here again",4,2017,04,03
235,Park & Fly,Used this hotel for the parking service while flying out of Dublin. Shuttle service is reasonable but priced per person so wouldn't be good if we had to take our 5 kids.  Only problem was the gates to the car park were a pain and involved me running back to the hotel to get a new key card.,4,2017,03,29
235,first class,"cant say enough about this hotel only like its home away from home. we had a fab dinner pure delish.. staff outstanding, dont no what to say only stay here.. we are staying one night but would stay here longer no questions, keep up the good work. from ladies traveling to switzerland xx",5,2017,03,28
235,Great Stafff!!,"Very nice hotel. Good room with all the needed ameneties for this range of hotel. Good location to access the city center and especially the airport. Great staff, very friendly and always ready to help in case you need any help.",5,2017,03,27
235,Best team of staff I've ever come across ,"Stayed at the Metro for the first time, just on overnight stay and I have to say I was so impressed, the room was incredible (we were upgraded) the cleanliness of the rooms and comfort of the beds was amazing, we ate in the bistro and the food was delicious, but I have to say the most impressive thing about the hotel was the staff, I've honestly never ever come across such a friendly and helpful bunch of people,  we'll definitely be returning in the future.",5,2017,03,26
235,Great hotel and fabulous team throughout.,Hotel bus from airport very useful.  Went for the 6 Nations Rugby and with a tip from a member of the restaurant used the local bus instead of taxi to go to game.  Saved a fortune thank you.  Would use again,5,2017,03,26
235,Good Value Hotel,"Stayed overnight in the Metro. Bedroom was lovely and shower was the best ever. Had great sleep
No noise. We had the early bird menu in restaurant . Definitely stay there again . Staff very helpful.

Was ",4,2017,03,26
235,Second time around,Second time staying in this hotel and I still gave the same dilemma between a very strong 3 and a kinda hesitant 4  rating... the hotel is good but it is kinda tiered. Four a few nights it is perfect. Great location  near the airport and with easy bus access to the down town. Really great service and wonderful helpful and friendly staff.. very good job to all the guys.  But still dine minor problems.. like getting the key to the wrong room and trying to break in with another guest there... probably need to apologise to the guy. My only serious complaint is that the second room we Were given had only one very tiny window.  Over all this hotel is good and i think with done minor renovation it would be easily a 4 star hotel,3,2017,03,25
235,"Second Stay, Best Prices Near Airport ","This was our second stay at the metro. Prices can't be beaten and there's a shuttle bus to and from the airport. The rooms were redecorated since our last stay and they were lovely, very comfortable. I must say though, the hotel did not feel as safe as our last visit, there were a few shady characters at the hotel - maybe this was us being paranoid! This is through no fault of the staff, the hotel did have 24 hour  security on the front door which was a welcome move, but we couldn't help feeling the atmosphere was a little different to our previous stay. Nevertheless, I will return again. ",4,2017,03,25
235,Over night stay,Stayed at the Metro as it was convenient to airport.  Very enjoyable stay bed very comfortable had a great nights sleep.  Ate in the Bisto food was lovely.  Got the shuttle bus in the morning to the Airport.  Would definately stay here again.,5,2017,03,25
235,Horrible Experience!,"Stayed here because it was close to the airport, and I had a 6am flight. Upon initial arrival into my room, it wasn't horrible, but it would do. Later I went downstairs to have dinner with a friend in the Bistro, and when I returned my entire floor absolutely reeked of marijuana even though the halls clearly marked my floor as a nonsmoking floor and the rooms stated a €500 fee would be assessed for smoking. I tried to get some sleep, the bed was decent, but woke up at 2am with the worse projectile vomiting and diarrhea in the existence of illness.... after contacting my friend who had eaten with me at the hotel restaurant, she had come down with the same symptoms several hours after I had. I continued to vomit, have diarrhea, and run a fever for 3 days after my stay here! I was so sick I missed my 6am flight, so really, what was even the point in staying so close to the airport? Horrible experience. I would never stay here or recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2017,03,20
235,One night relaxing  stay with boyfriend ,"I and my boyfriend stayed at Metro Dublin  airport  for one night. I was expecting for the hotel not to be great, but it turned out to be just amazing. Good value for money.

The hotel is about 7-10 minutes  away from Dublin airport  terminal 1 and 2. We got the shuttle bus from zone 16 to the airport.  The bus took a while to come, because  we didn't  book for it to come. When it did arrive, it was free to the hotel, but when going  back to the airport  we were charged €5 each (so €10 for two people).

The hotel itself was very clean and the rooms were spotless too with huge bathrooms and rooms. The receptionists were very friendly and made sure we were comfortable with everything. 
We were given some bread with nuttela for free which was such a lovely gesture from the hotel, because  we didn't  want full breakfast.

I and my boyfriend  enjoyed our stay here and we are planning  on going back soon. 

",5,2017,03,17
235,Perfect for a quick visit,It was very easy to find.  Very friendly staff at check-in.  We parked on the street outside and got the €4 parking ticket from the hotel for the overnight stay.  Room was clean and perfectly adequate for our quick visit.  We left at 3am; friendly night-porter checked us out.  Would definitely stay again for an early flight.,4,2017,03,14
235,Great Stay,"Small rooms but really nicely decorated, very comfy and staff very helpful! was a great stay and 40% less than nearby hotels. The only thing to point out that I felt a bit sick after eating the chocolates left in the room, When checked they had expired by 3 months! ",5,2017,03,13
235,Not recommended,Staid at this location for approximately a week. Hotel room was small with no amenities except towels and instant coffee. Restaurant food is a good price as long as you catch the early bird special. Service is a little slow and takes some time to get waited on and to get food served esp if there is more than 2 groups of people in the restaurant. The breakfast is semi decent. It takes a while to have pancakes made but they are a good recommendation over the rest of the food. Possibly would stay again here only if unable to find another hotel. ,2,2017,03,12
235,lovely room,"Stayed here for 1 night, great value for park fly and stay. Rooms are spacious and the bed was new and huge. The shower was big and spotless and just what I needed after a long day travelling. I would stay here again.",5,2017,03,11
235,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for a few nights while sightseeing in Dublin. It is a reasonably short bus ride to the city center. 
The hotel is finished very nicely, with comfortable beds and nice big windows. We also got a suite with a kitchenette, which gave us a comfortable place to sit and relax and also keep some food on hand.",5,2017,03,11
235,Lovely overnight stay,"Checked into the Metro Hotel for a one night stay to be told at reception that we had very kindly been upgraded to a suite! The room was extremely spacious and had a kitchenette with fridge and microwave. 

We parked on the on-site carpark and had to pay €4 to park overnight, which was a downside. Didn't have a chance to try the food or breakfast.",5,2017,03,11
235,"Location, cost and service were all excellent","Midway between the airport and city with a regular hotel minibus able to collect and return you to the airport. There are 2 regular bus services to the city which cost 2.70 each way. You must pay with coins on the bus and there is no change. 
The rooms are large and better than i expected for the price with such comfortable and large beds and no road noise. Breakfast could be bought each morning for about 7euro and was fresh and ample. 
The reception staff couldn't have been more helpful.

Highly recommended to anyone not wanting to stay in the middle of the rather busy and often gridlocked city.",5,2017,03,11
235,Lovely Hotel,We stayed there on feb 22nd the night before we went to Portugal..It is a lovely hotel rooms were lovely beds so comfy could not ask for better a staff member toild us it was a 3 star hotel ..but to be honest it was a 4 star in our opinion food was delicious in their restaurant..and we had the shuttle bus take us to the airport . We also stayed there on March 2nd on our return from Portugal..same great service.. The staff were very helpful and a special mention to the Chef he cooks some great food. Will definitely stay there again and have allready recommended it to our friends. Thank you so much to the staff and Manager for running such a lovely hotel.,4,2017,03,09
235,Overnight Stay,"Knowing that i would have a very late flight back from holidays I book a night in the Metro for when we returned,after arriving after midnight we got a taxi to hotel,we were met a a very pleasant  young man who informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite.We had a great nights sleep in a king sized bed.Breakfast was between 7 and 10am,which was very good.Its a few years since we last stayed there but it wont be as long the next time.",5,2017,03,06
235,Just what is needed! ,We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the metro hotel! All staff are friendly. The room was spotless with a very comfy bed!! Breakfast was €11 and was enjoyable! Plenty of food on a buffet style system. The shuttle bus was very good however to be advertised as an airport hotel it did seem a bit further out! There is a public bus which runs approx every 15 mins into the centre of Dublin. It takes about 20 mins and do have change as they don't take notes. We would definitely recommend this hotel. Clean friendly and a good shuttle bus from the airport.  ,4,2017,03,05
235,Excellent Staff,"A thoroughly fantastic weekend, well looked after by great staff. The shuttle bus service is very good, and it`s a very quiet hotel. Breakfast was plentiful and of excellent quality. Would recommend to anyone staying in Dublin",5,2017,03,04
235,Amazing service,"We stayed at the metro for 3 nights and the service we received was amazing, the staff went over and above with us in that we caused some inconvenience with deposits and such before we even got there and they handled it amazingly. All of their staff make you feel relaxed and comfortable and just at home! I also feel the chef deserves a special mention as the brownies are to die for!! Thanks for an amazing stay!",5,2017,03,04
235,"Great service, early check in and free upgrade. ",Allowed us to check in at 9am and upgraded us without us asking. The service was great and the room and bed was perfect for one night away. Very reasonable price too with good access to the airport and city. ,5,2017,03,03
235,Overnight stay ,Stayed overnight.room very nice and very clean.staff very welcoming and friendly.food lovely and restaurant staff very pleasant and professional. Would definitely return with friends. Great location as it is near the airport and also shuttle service available to the airport.,4,2017,03,02
235,Weekend first trip to a Dublin! ,"We stayed at the metro for 3 nights over weekend of Ireland Vs France rugby match, the Shuttle bus driver was friendly and helpful! Staff at hotel all very welcoming and helpful also. The breakfast was good, bedrooms were basic but very clean and modern. We were next to a store cuboard so the maid woke us both mornings at 7:30am bashing about...it didn't take away from the nice hotel though. Bus stop was close by number 4 takes straight into town. I would. Stay here again! Just not next to the maids cupboards! ",4,2017,03,01
235,convenient for airport,"Hotel is practical. No frills. Rooms are clean and bright. Check in efficient and friendly. Food in restaurant nothing special, ok. Service good. Hotel offers shuttle to/ from airport, but not free. One of the few to start at 04am to the airport. Very good for early departures.",4,2017,02,28
235,An Other Excellent Visit .,"Once again we chose the Metro as our departure Hotel from Dublin.

Every visit exceeds all expectations and so it was with this one.

Warm welcome from happy staff , excellent meal in Bistro 9.

Brand New  171 shuttle bus and courteous driver .

Superb room , spotless bed linen and not a speck of dust anywhere.

Of course there are ""other airport hotels"" but there is only One Metro and with a staff who really enjoy their job and make you feel that your custom is truly valued and you are more than just a room number this is indeed the best around. 

It is ideally suited also if you need  an hotel whilst visiting the Sports Surgery Clinic just around the corner.

We will be back again and have no hesitation in saying that The Metro does everything it says on the tin  , and more besides",5,2017,02,25
235,Cosy and clean,"We stayed up in this hotel after spending the night in Dublin....no major issues with it. Cosy and clean, bathroom and shower nice. Bit of an issue with sorting out parking but nothing major. Id stay again.",4,2017,02,22
235,Thoroughly relaxing stay,"Great experience in this hotel. Room was clean, spacious and warm. The meals were great and the service was very friendly. The restaurant waitress Petronela was very friendly and kind. We ate in the restaurant in the evenings several times, including on Valentine's evening and she was most kind and informative. My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed the overall experience and we hope to return again!",5,2017,02,20
235,"Affordable, Basic",Just needed a place to stay before heading to the airport. It's conveniently located near the airport with a shuttle to and from. Basic room with no extra frills. Big comfortable bed and free wifi. Staff was courteous and helpful. ,3,2017,02,18
235,Expectations exceeded!,"Lovely room, comfy bed, nice clean and big bathroom with shower.  Great wifi and free!  Friendly and helpful staff.  Was very pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to stay again at the Metro Airport Hotel in Dublin.",4,2017,02,17
235,Great hotel with great service.,"From the staff of  hotel´s Bistro 9 headed by it´s manager Mr Rakesh Arandkar,they gave us an extra super service for my daughter´s pre birthday celebration that we won´t  ever forget.The waiter named Marius was so friendly and he accomodated as if we´ve met for long long.He assisted us politely and he´s really dedicated on his job.As a customer and guest of hotel,we wanted of couse that we feel really at home and that definitely we had.2 thumbs up!",4,2017,02,16
235,Valentine's Day ,"Lovelly surprise from my boyfriend to take me to this hotel for Valentine's Day! Didn't expected to be so nice,clean,good athmosphere with nice music ,tasty food(I had seafood platter for starter,main course rib eye steak with mash potatoes and pepper sauce which was lovelly ,and as well a delicious brownie with vanilla ice cream !) I must say I was really impressed about Petronela,the supervisor ,who served us irreproachable,making sure all the time that is everything perfect! Definitely I will go back again! ",5,2017,02,15
235,Visiting with 4 young children,"Great hotel that can accommodate 2 adults and 4 children, believe me that is a big ask anywhere!  Suite contained a fridge, microwave, kettle and small sink, the kids shared 2 double sofa beds, was perfect.  Our bed was lovely, really comfy plenty of space in the room . You get a free gift with each stay so we took the free parking.  Really lovely stay overall.",5,2017,02,14
235,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"We had suite. Lovely, spacious room in beautiful colors. Everything was clean, not destroyed. Nice kitchenette where everything works correctly. Big window give You really nice view. You can imagine that You can do one step and You fall on the ground. Also room was warm, heaters works properly. Staff was polite. Cleaning staff is like invisible. We also recommend their bus to the airport. For us that was one of best places where we were. Next time when I will have to choose a hotel. I want this.

Only one thing. Hotel is placed on the big cross road. Heavy traffic can be really noisy at day. I have light sleep. But I slept all night, every day.",5,2017,02,14
235,Excellent ....as always ,Love this hotel....not  just because  it means we are leaving the country lol but because of the staff. They are wonderful. Everyone you deal with are so friendly and  welcoming. The shuttle bus drivers are fantastic.  When we arrived the bus was departing and the driver saw us running and very kindly stopped to let us on .he was so helpful.  Check in girl was very efficient.  Room was clean and comfortable. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was fantastic. Again top marks to the metro...Can't wait before to return!,5,2017,02,14
235,What was needed but not more,"We picked this hotel for two reasons - close proximity to the airport AND availability of a 10am check in time.  Our room was small, slightly dated, but clean and had all of the amenities one could ask for at the price.  The staff was very helpful and very friendly.  (One member of the staff, who answered my question about some punt coins I had from a previous trip, didn't laugh at me, which I appreciated, since the Irish haven't used punt coins since 2002.)  Since we were only here for one evening AND were wicked tired, we opted to stay in on the cold, windy and wet that greeted us, and the room was perfect place to put our feet up, watch movies (on free WIFI) and relax.  I do recommend this place, but do know that this is outside of Dublin and only serviced by two bus lines.  Cheers!",4,2017,02,13
235,Excellent!,"Lovely Hotel, very clean. Staff are very friendly - especially the Security Man! The Bus service to/from Airport is very good, less than 10 minutes away and a lovely friendly driver too!
Beds are very comfortable and the food is good too in Restaurant. Definitely would recommend and return to this Hotel again. ",5,2017,02,10
235,Unsafe hotel,Stayed here on 18 Jan 17 for one night for an early flight next morning and was sorry felt really unsafe In this hotel eveytime I went outside I was asked for a cigarette or change for food from the many drug dealers and users that hang around outside even heard one woman offer her services to the men out there was delfinalty on earth hotel I couldn't wait to check out of and will certainly not ever return pay the extra money and stay closer to airport for a peaceful night lrooms are nice for the price but I like to feel safe on my nights away,2,2017,02,06
235,Handy to get to Dublin airport by this hotels shuttle bus,You are made welcome from the moment you arrive. Great and helpful staff . Great food. Room rates the best near Dublin Airport.You can leave your car while you go away on business or vacation. A small charge applies but cheaper than Dublin airport and remember you can then take the shuttle bus from literally outside the hotel.  ,5,2017,01,31
235,Quietly Surprised,I am from Dublin and I was a little hesitant about booking this hotel due to the local area. I have to say I was really surprised at how nice it was. The bathroom was adequate and spotless clean. The beds were comfy. We had fish and chips in the restaurant/bar area. The food was lovely. We didn't get a chance to sample breakfast as we were away to the airport. There was a transfer available at €5 per head. It was reasonable considering the only other way to get there is by taxi and would be more expensive. Plus it's by minibus and if you have luggage or children with you it's far easier taking this option.,5,2017,01,27
235,Lovely!,"The hotel was very clean, modern, friendly. I had a great experience at the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport! My room was very comfortable with great facilities and also everything was very clean! I surely recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,01,25
235,Pleasant Stay,"The Front Desk staff was very helpful and  there was not problem with the check-in process.The bar and restaurant staff were very friendly.The buffet breakfast had choices that would please everyone.
The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel has a good location.",5,2017,01,24
235,"Calm, quiet and relaxing.","Recently stayed in the Metro hotel for a last minute trip to Dublin. I took advantage of their January sale and got myself a double room inclusive. I must say the entire stay from start to finish was just what I needed; calm, quiet and relaxing. The room was spotless, modern and well presented, with all the basic amenities I needed. From the shuttle bus driver who picked me up from the airport to the cleaners in the corridor all the staff had a smile on their face and were kind. The all you can eat breakfast was fresh with a good range of hot and cold choices in a quiet hassle free environment of the bistro bar.
The hotel is only a 15 minute bus ride from the centre of Dublin and the shuttle bus is no more that 10 minutes (traffic dependant). If I ever head to Dublin again I would be sure to consider the Metro Hotel if the prices are acceptable outside of the sale prices I picked up. I would highly recommend. Thanks guys!",5,2017,01,23
235,Outstanding Hotel Top Class!,"Well chose this Hotel through recommendation and also reading that close to airport, on the plus side there is a bus stop more or less outside the hotel, catch the 4 taking you straight to the city centre, and vice versa. In the hotel, the staff are fantastic, very friendly and helpful, accommodating, housekeeping staff did a good job within our room, and the bar staff to as well as the reception are amazing i cannot rate these people more. This is a must to stay, and will without a doubt stay here again. Slept like a baby beds are amazing.",5,2017,01,23
235,A Cosmopolitan hotel close to Dublin airport,"Try Dublin's Salmon at their lovely,Quiet Restaurant which is reasonably priced.  The Staff extremely helpful and Professional.  A thoughtful Welcome Pack in a Room of your choice with a Lily O' Brien's Chocolate for treat-time.  Good Internet and Computer access here which is ideal for a Business trip to Dublin City.  The room was well heated for a cold Irish Winter's Evening and a beautifull ;picture of the Samuel Beckett Bridge created an Artistic ambience.  Next time when looking up Hotels in the Dublin Area, you will enjoy this lovely Hotel.",5,2017,01,17
235,Would Recommend,"Stayed in the Metro on Jan 2nd 2017 with my boyfriend. Would definitely recommend it if you need a hotel in close proximity to Dublin airport. They provide a shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins and only cost €5 for the two of us! Very handy! Hotel only cost €68 for the night! Very good when on a budget, particularly after Xmas! Staff were also very friendly.

Found the room to be very clean and spacious. I slept very well, bed was very comfortable! Had some food in their restaurant which is fairly priced and served until 10pm most nights. They even provide and computer and printer for use which we availed of! It's not free, but cheap to use! Very handy! It's in the bar area. 

I only have minor complaints to do with my stay. The drain in the shower, in our room, did not drain very well. While using the shower, I had to turn the water off twice because I was afraid it would flood? This just may be with our particular room as from viewing other peoples photos, our shower was different? Also, there was a ceiling light that, although was off and had never been turned on while we were there, had a green ominous glow from it. Had I not taken a sleeping pill and had an eye mask, this would have definitely disturbed my sleep. It was bright enough when the room was in complete darkness. 

All in all, I found the faults to be minor and was happy with my stay and service received. I will/would stay here again in the future. ",4,2017,01,07
235,Good for a few night/near airport.,"Stayed on Business overnight in Dec 16. 

Room was clean, comfortable with all the usual amenities. Bed was clean and comfortable. Tv with Freeview (IRE and U.K. Channels). Tea/coffee and some biscuits. Wifi was good in the room. Digital safe, iron etc

Bathroom had Shower and the ""on the wall type"" soaps and show gel and white towels.

Hotel seems generally quiet and is a few minutes from airport. There is a small shopping centre just up the road, seems to be quiet area. It's right beside M50 on north side of Dublin.

Parking is free if you book on their web site. 

Locked door/ security on hotel entrance door at night.

Restaurant was clean and food was good. Quiet.

Breakfast was the normal fried or continental help yourself. No complains.

Would/will use this hotel again.",4,2017,01,06
235,Great for airport,"Stayed in a triple room on Wed 28th Jan with my mam and son as he had an early flight from the airport the following morning. Was quiet surprised by this hotel, picked it due to its convient location to the airport (could see the terminal from our room), its off the Ballymun exit from the Motorway and less than 2 minutes away from the exit (also very close to ikea..only a minutes drive) and for the price, €79 for the room on this particular night..room only rates (Double room was €59). Having arrived in the evening we headed straight for food, food served till 10pm and it was delicious, not one fault with dinner. The following morning my son got his shuttle bus at 5am (€5 single journey). We didnt have breakfast as we requested late checkout so we were heading to Avoca on way home. Hot breakfast in hotel is €11, continental is €7. Overnight parking €4, late checkout €12..but if you book directly with hotel they have a special offer of a choice of free parking, or late checkout or free wine or desert with dinner or welcome room pack so worth booking directly to get whichever suits for free. Room was big and spacious, lovely bathroom, very clean and nicely decorated. Overall very impressed with the hotel itself, food, and lovely friendly helpful staff. Will definitely be staying here again and i have already recommended it to people. Docked one pount just because of a little traffic noise as its on the road out to the motorway but it does quieten during the night. ",4,2017,01,04
235,Perfect for airport ,"Had a great experience, booked because had an early flight but also needed to be in city for a gig the night before so this hotel was ideal. Got an early check in and a free upgrade! Beds were comfy, room clean and it was quiet. Only downside was the doors to the car park weren't working properly and this led to a little stress when having to catch bus to airport early in the morning. It was great value though and great value to stay, park and fly ",5,2017,01,04
235,Slept like a log...,"Too be quite honest had the most relaxing stay ever so pleasant overly helpful food was great I actually never expected it too be such good quality....highly recommend this hotel just excellent roomy smart apartment. 

Many thanks 

Ny",5,2017,01,02
235,Ideal ,Ideal place to stay the night before an early flight. Good shuttle service and very friendly staff. Restaurant serves lovely food and bar has a relaxed atmosphere. Rooms are clean and well-kept. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2017,01,01
235,Great base for Dublin,"Located about a 5 minute drive from the airport and about 15 minutes from Dublin centre, this hotel was a great place to stay. We stayed in a suite and for £84 (99euro) it was worth every penny.  Bed was huge and comfortable, there was a kitchen area, sofa, TV, and clean bathroom. Even though it was New Year's Eve, we didn't hear any noise throughout the night. The shuttle bus from the airport was 5euro each return from the airport to the hotel and we scheduled the return time with the front desk. We were surprised we had to pay for the shuttle as thought it was complimentary like most other hotels. For 11euros breakfast was good, not much choice for the hot breakfast and some of it was a bit hard with it being left on counter. Also the toaster takes a long time to make the toast, a conveyer toaster would be more suitable for a hotel. The bus to the city centre takes approx 40 mins and bus stop is outside hotel. Taxi from city centre was about 15euros. Would definitely stay here again! ",4,2017,01,01
235,Nice hotel,"The hotel rooms are great, a good size and clean.  Hotel is also very quiet.  Staff are friendly and it's good value.  Downside is the 2nd car park, there isn't much room outside the hotel and if you have to use the other car park it is further away and you need a card to get access in and out - meaning you need to check in and then take your car around and come back again....  Not a great walk in the dark on your own if you have to park here!",4,2016,12,27
235,A good night's sleep and an airport shuttle,"The hotel is very close to the airport, so I stayed here the last night of my Ireland trip. It was a little difficult to get here from Dublin since I didn't have a car, so I took the bus to a stop nearby and was fortunate that another passenger knew the way to the hotel from there. Once I arrived, the hotel room was small but comfortable, and I got a good night's sleep here before an early departure the next morning. The hotel provides shuttle service to the airport, which you can book the night before. This service was much appreciated! There's not much else around in terms of shops and restaurants, but there is a restaurant in the hotel.",4,2016,12,27
235,Overnight stay,"Very good hotel, easy access to Dublin airport . Would recommend it to anyone that would be travelling early from Dublin airport.very good restaurant and  very helpful staff. It was great value for money. Very safe parking but there is also a shuttle service that runs to the airport every 30 mins. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room.i will stay there again and recommend it to all my family and friends.",5,2016,12,21
235,"Excellent near Airport Hotel, Great Value","10 minutes shuttle bus distance away form Dublin Airport. The hotel is modern, clean, good bedrooms, and comfortable bar/restaurant. Friendly staff, and very swift checkin.

Ideal place to stop over if on an early flight to the airport. Book your shuttle bus seat when you check in, 5 euros, the bus goes every 30 minutes.

At 59 euros for single occupance in a double room, the value for money is fantastic.",5,2016,12,21
235,Parking at the Metro,"Good service for Park and Ride. Traveled back on 10/12/2016. Was picked up by Michael. Remembered him from the last time I used the service. Great bloke, very friendly. reception  staff were very nice as well. Only small downside is that car park 2 is a bit away from the actual hotel.",4,2016,12,20
235,A Very Pleasant Stay!,"Returned from the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport last night having enjoyed  a very pleasant one night stay there, and we would recommend it.
We got the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel,  and rang the hotel on our mobile on our arrival to order it.  We had to wait 25 minutes standing around  in the cold, so depending how many of you are in your group, might be cheaper and quicker getting a taxi from the rank.   The shuttle is free to the hotel but you pay going back to the airport.
The hotel was modern, well maintained and clean, just as it appears on the hotel website.  It is located on a busy main road and the traffic noise during the night was continuous, but that is our only negative. 
The rooms were spotlessly clean, the beds large and comfortable, the ensuite bathroom had a walk in shower,  with limitless hot water,  and good quality big fluffy towels.  Tea and coffee making facilities in the room were adequate and when we ran out of milk it was no problem when we asked for more from the hotel bar.  There was a powerful hairdryer in the room, ironing board and iron.   The room was hot on arrival so we turned down the radiator, it actually worked and the temperature cooled down! ( I stay in so many hotels where you cannot control the room temperature, so it was a bonus being able to)!
The restaurant Bistro 9 was open plan and all 4 of us enjoyed the different meals we had ordered, although despite the restaurant being very quiet, we had to wait 45 minutes for our meals.  The desserts were a bit tasteless although presented beautifully.  
We must express our thanks to the young guy on reception during most of our stay.  We needed to book 4 taxis journeys to and from the hotel during our stay and he was so helpful and arranged them for us.  All the staff, including the bar staff and in the restaurant, were very friendly, cheerful and genuinely helpful and this enhanced our stay.
I did email the hotel at various times before our arrival asking for clarification about certain aspects of our booking, and they were very slow to respond, if at all.  That is a shame as it creates doubts in your mind about the hotel in general.  In fact, in our experience during our short stay, the hotel and staff are to be praised and we will return.
",4,2016,12,19
235,Great value for money friendly staff ,"What can I say about this hotel I booked as had flight out from Dublin early next morning. I was unsure about this hotel with hotel as the location of it. But I was pleasantly surprised to be honest. The hotel is great location for airport and 15 mins from city centre. The rooms are small but clean with tv and kettle for a cup of tea. Secure under ground car parking with shuttle that runs to airport every 30 mins. 
My say the staff are more than helpful I stay there on 13 th December the 2 ladies I meet were just a delight to deal with so friendly and full of information about the area for me. Can't say enough about these to ladies.  Friendly excellent ladies. 
Was able to go to ikea across the road which was great. 
There is a bar that sells food down stairs I didn't eat there but I did have a drink there nice place big and airy. 
Would stay here again got great deal great location for airport  and very friendly services from staff. ",5,2016,12,15
235,Recommend,"I have stayed here a few times now,I would definitely stay here again, from the welcome at Reception to the comfy bed , good shower, great restaurant, great staff  great location and efficient friendly shuttle 
Service to the airport .",4,2016,12,12
235,Exceptional ,"Stayed here recently and the service was absolutely impeccable, I have stayed in some nice hotels across Ireland in closing the Sheraton athlone and by far the customer service in this hotel surpassed them all. In particular I would like to mention ""petronela"" the restaurant supervisor who couldn't do more for you. Making sure you were looked after without being pushy. Would give 6 stars if I could lol ",5,2016,12,10
235,Kinda expensive. But ok,"Breakfast is either 7€50 or 11€. Laundry services are ridiculously expensive. Room was tidy and comfortable for a single person. Be aware that you are half an hour away from the city center by bus. Mi biggest complaint is the staff, they do their job ok, but all the kind words and smiles and the ""dear beloved customer"" attitude is thrown out the window. (exception made for one lovely young concierge)",3,2016,12,10
235,"Fantastic, can't wait to return!","We stayed here for one night recently before an early morning flight. The shuttle bus drivers were really nice, the guy I can't remember his name but he lived locally was especially very friendly and funny, even gave us tips on the country we were travelling to! Reception staff were friendly, very prompt check in. Our room was beautiful, spotless and a great size. Had a separate kitchen area which we were not expecting so this was fab! I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel. Free bottles of water on our bedside lockers were a nice touch. We travel to Dublin a lot so I am definitely going to stay here again and I've recommended it to everyone! The one bad thing was we didn't get to stay long enough! Really loved it and the price was great! Very close to the airport and the shuttle service is brill!",5,2016,12,09
235,Metro hotel,"Hotel is okay nice rooms an food was nice  but we wouldnt stay here again though we were up on fourth floor so noisy from all the traffic,The window wouldn't close properly so didnt have hardly any sleep .",1,2016,12,08
235,Nice Budget airport hotel,"For overnight stay a very good budget hotel in Dublin airport, Very good restaurant/ good breakfast options/ lunch and dinner menu are not exhaustive but good food.Friendly reception staff / very helpful when we asked about the train and bus time table the reception staff was so kind to give us a print out that was amazing/ really helpful/ They have a airport shuttle service, on time 10 minutes to terminal 2
we stayed for 4 nights,  Well connected to the city center rout number 4  take you to the city center in 20 minutes.
There is nothing around the hotel 10 minutes there is a very big shopping mall
Value for money and good staff keep it up",4,2016,12,08
235,Good ,"I stayed there for a night before a flight. It was very easy fins he shuttle to hotel. The drivers of the shuttle bus were very friendly. It only took about 10 mins to get to the hotel. All the staff were very polite. The room was clean and spacious, free wifi. They serve food til quite late at a reasonable price. Pleasant stay, nothing negative to say, would recommend. ",4,2016,12,07
235,Perfect for an airport hotel,"Just stayed here for one night when my friend and I arrived in Dublin in the evening and were hiring a car from the airport the next morning. The staff were friendly and helpful about arranging transport for us the next morning. The shuttle to the airport was every half hour, which ended up being tricky timing for us so the concierge was happy to call for a taxi for us. The rooms were really lovely and the breakfast was really great with a wide variety!",5,2016,12,06
235,Twice in Three weeks!!,"Very quick one here because I've saved all the nice praise for the hotel in a direct email.

Outstanding service, from check in to end. I have dealt with Kati in reservations and Daniel in reception. Everything has been so seamless and really eases parts of organising this business trip. 

Best of luck to you, fantastic work.",5,2016,12,05
235,Decent airport hotel ,"I stayed there because I had an early morning flight. The shuttle service from the airport worked well, rooms were good and clean, and the restaurant served decent food, too. Overall a solid hotel where I would stay again ",4,2016,12,01
235,"Efficient helpful staff went the extra mile ,a rare thing now a days","We used the park and fly facility we found the staff very pleasant and helpful 
My husband is disabled and we were give extra help for check in and transportation to our room
The room was beautiful it had a small kitchenette and a wet room wished we'd been staying longer.
The shuttle to the airport was efficient and on time and we agin were give a lot of help
We did eat in the bistro and the food was good.
We arrived back this morning at around 5am the shuttle vis driver gave us a lot of help 
We had a lot of baggage !!!! When we got back to the hotel our car wouldn't start 
Every one from the security guy to the desk manager John helped even jump starting us !!
Then the shuttle driver and the security guy helped us pack our car .
Everyone was courteous and helpful it's so daunting travelling when you are disabled 
So it was great to have everyone pitch in to help us , couldn't say enough good things about all the staff we encountered !!! Well done !! A great asset to the hotel",5,2016,11,29
235,5 minutes from airport; parking lot and ramp; great views.,"Stayed 4 nights in October 2016 on holiday/vacation from Minneapolis, MN, USA. Two adults, 2-room suite with kitchenette, 2 twin beds. The suite was very spacious: Large main bedroom with 2 twin beds, nightstands, desk, chairs, TV, large closet and a window wall. Bathroom was modern and very clean. The other room had a pull-out sleeper coach, eating table, chairs, refrigerator and the kitchenette area.It would be great for a family. We parked our rental car either in the surface lot outside the lobby or in the underground parking ramp. Very convenient. Bus to Dublin City stops within a block and took about 30 minutes. Shuttle bus from the airport is free, but there is a $5.00 charge to go to the airport. There are many hotels in the city, but for a hotel south of the airport on the bus route to the city, with parking, this one is great. The restaurant/bar is large. There is also a computer and printer, where, for a fee, one can print a boarding pass. It worked fine for a couple of euros. If you are looking for a hotel south of the airport and on the direct bus route to the city, this one is great.",3,2016,11,29
235,All that we needed,"We had spent 2 weeks driving around Ireland and this was a quick overnight stay before flying out to Italy. We picked up the shuttle from the airport after dropping off the hire car without any problems. Check in was smooth and friendly and the room was clean, comfortable and all we needed. 

We went down to the bar and had a few cocktails and a very tasty meal for a very reasonable price. The next morning we had an early flight so caught the shuttle back to the airport., took less than 10 minutes .... only €5 each! 

Would definitely recommend for an overnight stay close to the airport.",5,2016,11,28
235,Hotel good. Shame about the pick up from airport,Stayed here for 1 night with parking for a few days for holiday. Room lovely and food in bar equally lovely. Got dropped off at airport in morning and came back approx 10pm mon night. Email instructions state to use courtesy phone at arrivals in terminal 1 and dial #120 only to find out no phone to ring hotel. Wasted 15 mins waiting at bay 16 then rang hotel to be told it would be 30mins before pick up. Not a good impression if you're trying to get business. TIP correct information is always helpful and appreciated. So easy to inform customer to ring hotel when at baggage pick up and tell customer how soon pick up will be. No-one likes waiting long on a cold night especially when they have a 3hr drive ahead. Cost €15 to get to metro by taxi.,4,2016,11,23
235,Still The Best,"We are delighted to review this hotel yet again,
We use it every time we fly out of Dublin and can not fault it in any way.
The few Minor issues that we mentioned in previous reviews were all attended to and I am at a loss to understand reviews that give low marks because ""you have to pay for the shuttle"" or The hotel is not beside the Airport . 
The Metro information on the web site is clear and concise and this is one of the few 3* hotels that deliver 4* + service every time.
The manager Mark Williams and all his staff are mindful of the guests requirements and deliver a quality service, on all aspects , of hospitality food and comfort.
I have eaten in Bistro 9 many many times and am delighted that another reviewer also noted an exceptional Elena in the restaurant, and every one from the shuttle driver to the check in staff are without exception a credit both to themselves and the hotel.
I have recommended the Metro to friends and relation who ravel from the West and fly out from Dublin , and they all say the same thing.  Its not the Ritz but its still the best .",5,2016,11,11
235,Not one complaint ,"We left our car here on a Friday until Sunday as a  very good value ""park, stay & fly"" deal. Secure underground car park is great. The shuttle bus wasn't running Friday evening at 5.45 to bring us to the airport but they called a taxi and paid for it. On returning Sunday the shuttle bus was there at the airport pick you point within 10 minutes. Nice clean bus with a very friendly driver. When we got to the hotel it was all very fast as I had already paid for the room in advance. The room was lovely. Spotless clean, as was the bathroom which was large. The room was a perfect size. It was warm and the bed was huge and so comfy. They allowed us to get a delivery from a local takeaway which was great as it was nearly midnight and the restaurant was closed. We didn't eat in the hotel at all. I dealt with 5 members of staff between parking the car and then checking into the hotel. Every one of them was highly competent and very friendly. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. I will definitely be using it any time I'm flying from Dublin Airport. ",5,2016,11,11
235,Excellent hotel in a dodgy area,"To be honest I am judging the area based on my journey from Charlestown to the hotel but I wouldn't want to walk through it after seeing random bonfires and cars on bricks. I was also told it would be advisable to cover my English accent if I was stupid enough to walk through. Advise given to me by people on my course that live in the area.

However I am reviewing the hotel and it was an excellent stay. It was 5-10 mins in a taxi from where I was working and 10 minutes from the airport. If you want to get into Dublin centre it's 15 Euro in a cab or you can take the bus which is over 2Euro but takes half an hour. All this information is on a welcome sheet on check in or a welcome pack in your room.

I was greeted by Sarah at reception who had to press a button to open the automatic door!?! (Something to do with the area maybe) Sarah was a very smiley girl, welcoming and very helpful. She gave me so much info I didn't think I'd make it to my room but that is actually a service I appreciate and would also know who to go to if I needed help with anything. My only problem is that I was informed that breakfast wasn't included in my stay and I am sure I booked one so I am yet to find out if the hotel or the website I booked through got it wrong. Definitely says breakfast included in price of stay on my email.

The hotel is very nice looking, modern with a slight classic touch. Efficient spacious lift service to take me to my room on floor 3. The room itself is small with a double bed but plenty of cupboard space. Modern looking except for the decor which didn't quite work but still very happy with my hotel choice thus far. Small room but quite spacious bathroom with a great shower with hot water that can scald you if turned up to high, a few cosmetic touch ups wouldn't go a miss but very happy with my bathroom. 

Great choice of channels on TV if you want to spend your evening in the room and I also had a great view of the airport as I was on the third floor. Great if you are a geek like me who likes to watch take offs and landings of planes. The bed was comfy and had all the decent facilities wanted like tea and coffee a safe and iron and board.

I went to the bar/restaurant for dinner and a pint, pleasant place to be but very quiet. The staff again were very welcoming and helpful. Of course I had a Guinness which was perfect, so I had a second. For dinner I ordered the baked salmon with chicken wings on the side. The salmon had good flavours and well cooked but the chicken wings were excellent. I love wings so happy to see them on the menu, they were also well cooked with probably the best sauce I've ever had on wings. Bit of a sweet chilli/BBQ mix which was literally finger licking good. Actually came with a finger bow which you rarely get. The only downside was there wasn't enough of them, despite the great taste they were about two wings short of value for money. They worked out at just over a Euro a wing and they weren't that big. If the hotel served 8 wings would of definitely been fair reflection on price but the salmon was good value so no issue really. Breakfast next morning served in the same place, choice is decent and food is good. The meat did look like it had been left under the heat lamp too long other than that everything tasted fresh. 

Overall it is a three star hotel but the staff really go out to make an effort and with that and the look and feel of the hotel you will feel like your in at least a 4 star. ",4,2016,11,02
235,"Very kind and helpful staff, made being away from home a lot easier.","My boyfriend was away from home on business and was staying at this hotel for almost two weeks. He really enjoyed his stay but unfortunately was going to be spending his birthday there alone. I rang the hotel the day before his birthday, asking if they would mind sending breakfast up to his room or some small gesture just so that he knew we were thinking about him. I called the reception desk who took my details and within an hour received a phone call from a manager called Rocky who was more than happy to help with anything I wanted to do and wouldn't even allow me to compensate them for all there help. Rocky went over and beyond his duties to surprise my boyfriend by leaving a birthday cake and a card in his hotel room to surprise him when he got back. My boyfriend was delighted, it really made being away from home on his birthday a lot easier. Thank you to Rocky and all the staff that helped at the Hotel.",5,2016,11,01
235,Excellent Services from Elena (Morning Shift) Well Done!!!,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning on 10th October 2016, we've been served by friendly receptionist. While we were waiting at the lobby, a friendly waitress offered us a complimentary breakfast. A few minutes later, a duty manager from morning shift approved us to check in early. I'm happy with their quick and friendly services throughout our 2 weeks stay. 

I take this opportunity to thank one of your staff, Elena who works in the restaurant. Her warmth greetings and serving has always made us smiled since day 1 till we checked out. My friend and I definitely will come back to Metro Hotel Dublin in the future. Cheers ;)

Your Sincerely,

David & Darren Norris",5,2016,11,01
235,Very nice hotel,We stayed here the night before we headed off for a long weekend as it was advertised as an airport hotel. It is about 10 mins bus journey away from the airport but the shuttle bus was waiting at the door at the requested time ready to take us for our flight. We where able to leave our car at the secure hotel car park for the duration of our holiday at a reasonable rate. The meal we had in the bar was lovely and the room was a great size and spotless. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fridge made a terrible noise until we realised where the noise was coming from and in plugged it at 3am! We would definitely stay here again if we had any other early flights from Dublin. ,4,2016,10,30
235,Not great.,"Hotel is not really at airport, got off flight after being told to ring for a shuttle bus only to be told there was no shuttle bus coming. Paid for a taxi there. Check in was easy, though was surprised you had to pay for a shuttle bus to the airport as every other hotel that did airport shuttle busses offered them free. When I checked out i left a bag with toys in it and rang asking if they could check if it was there only to be answered with sighs as if I was asking them to go to another hotel to check. They found it and I asked could I pay shipping for it to be sent to me (not usually a problem in other hotels) they sighed and told me they'd call me back, never did until I had to ring again. They told me the manager said they wouldn't send it back even though I would cover any costs so had to get a friend to drive a long way to pick it up. 
Rooms are very nice but will not stay here again.",1,2016,10,26
235,Not really at the Airport,When we arrived at this hotel we were surprised to find that it is a 7 minute shuttle ride from the airport terminal. However once we checked in we found our room spacious and comfortable with all the usual amenities. Wifi was free and reliable. We opted to dine in the restaurant and enjoyed our meal both in the evening and early the following morning. The pre booked shuttle arrived on time and we arrived at the airport in plenty of time for our flight to France. We recommend this hotel,4,2016,10,22
235,Small,"I call in advance to check for shuttle. Get instructions and after landing, head to the right location. After more that 40 min waiting - I call again to get the news: our driver is not coming!!!  Yes - I took taxi but lost 45 min on waiting. Not OK!

The room is comfy but very small. Very very small. ",3,2016,10,21
235,Stop before flight,"We arrived at the metro for our stop off before catching our flight to Portugal, very reasonable, very friendly staff, we had dinner in the restaurant which was fab both of us enjoyed it very much, shuttle bus was prompt! We will definitely stay again if catching a flight as its only 7 minutes away from the airport! ",5,2016,10,19
235,Great front desk staff,"Arrived back in Dublin a day early for flight back to the States. We were looking for a hotel close to the airport and found Metro. The area around the hotel seemed a bit dodgy but the hotel was very clean and comfortable. The young man and lady at the front desk were extremely nice, helped us with dinner ideas and cabs. Check out was quick in the morning with van service to the airport if needed. The only downside for US travelers is there was very little air circulation in the rooms unless you had the window open...which looks out over a major road...no AC. Europeans don't fuss too much about that and frankly it's no big deal. Great place close to the airport for a great price",4,2016,10,19
235,Great Stay!!,"Stayed here 1 night for an early morning flight. Shuttle to the hotel is located right next to ""Our Lady Queen of Heaven"" church outside the departure gates. Follow the foot path till you see a small food stand...Shuttle took 10 mins to reach the hotel (in 5pm traffic). Shuttle is free going to the hotel but is $5.00 heading to airport. In the early morning hour it took 6 mins to get to the airport...

Check-in was easy, very friendly front desk girl. Our room was clean, super comfortable bed & huge bathroom. Wi-fi was good, no issues with it. There is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel, catch the #4 into Dublin city centre. 

We had dinner at the Bistro 9 in the hotel. Service was great, drinks were cold & a nice selection of wines. The food took a while to arrive but we were not in a hurry, it was hot, tasty & fairly cheap.",4,2016,10,18
235,Top class,"I stayed for one night recently. It's location was perfect for me as it's easy to access from the M50, it's just around the corner from IKEA which I need to get to and I was flying from Dublin airport the following morning. The ease of access to the airport was brilliant. 

The suite I stayed in was very comfortable, spacious and perfectly clean. 

The staff are really friendly and assisted me with anything I needed.

The food is gorgeous.",5,2016,10,18
235,Easy access to downtown Dublin,"A very good location and just out the front door the city bus goes direct to downtown. Comfortable rooms with good breakfast's. We did not want to stay downtown
because we were picking up a rental car at the airport after our stay in Dublin and did not want to have to drive in the inner city. This worked great as we were able to leave the city with very little hassle. The hotel has a shuttle service to and from the airport.",4,2016,10,16
235,One night stay,Found a good deal here prior to catching a morning flight and it was a nice stay. Airport shuttle is offered for a 5 euro. Parking is also available for a fee. Hotel is a little overpriced but rooms were spacious and clean. Staff was very friendly and assisted calling a taxi when we headed downtown. Would stay here again.,4,2016,10,12
235,Great Stay! ,"My husband and I stayed here on our last night in Ireland! Everything we experienced was fantastic! The employees were very friendly and were there to help with any questions we had. The lounge was comfortable and the bartender was very friendly and talkative. I had the vegetable soup, which was simple but delicious and later at night my husband and I had a couple of drinks, with a small plate of bar food - also very good!! 

The accommodations were clean and comfortable! Bathroom is spacious, clean and I especially enjoyed the shower set up! 

They did advertise that they have international adapters upfront, for a €5 deposit, which is fine, but the ones they have don't help their American guests. We lost ours during our travels and being able to use one would have been extremely helpful! But still, not their fault we lost ours.

Very close to the airport, which is a huge help, since we had an early flight! 

Overall, we had a lovely experience and would recommend this hotel! ",5,2016,10,11
235,Excellent Customer Service,"Checked in and had nothing but AMAZING customer service. The bar staff, and front desk staff went out of their way to ensure our comfort. We would certainly stay there again when flying out of Dublin. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Took the hotel shuttle to the airport in a clean spacious van and a courteous driver. Could not ask for more! I recommend this hotel",5,2016,10,11
235,Short stay hotel,"Due to flight delay we missed the last shuttle bus from airport to hotel, so we had to take a taxi. But its good that they have a shuttle service. Staff is very friendly. 30min bus drive to Dublin centre.... According to a local citizen not the safest neighbourhood, 
good streetlights",3,2016,10,09
235,Great hotel,"I'd read some of the reviews so wasn't sure what to expect at this three star hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised. 
The hotel is a short taxi ride from the airport and also has a shuttle bus (clear instructions on how to take the shuttle are provided in the reservation mail). The number four bus stops very near the hotel and takes you into town for about 3€ (make sure you have coins and no notes, no change is given on the bus)

Check in was very friendly and efficient. 
The rooms look like they have been done up recently and the beds are very comfortable. Everything was very clean and all of the staff were professional and helpful.
There was a strong smell of paint or cleaning products in my room so staff moved me immediately to another room, assured me that they would check up on what was causing the smell, offered to carry my bags to the new room and checked that everything was ok once I was in the new room. I really liked the fact that this was done very quickly and I wasn't made to feel that it was a hassle. 

We had breakfast there twice and it was very good. The cooked breakfast was nice and there was a good variety of fresh fruit salad, breads, pastries and cereal. Again it was clean and good quality. 
",5,2016,10,05
235,Service with a smile,The front desk staff were extremely obliging and went out of their way to ensure our comfort and enjoyment. They understood how tired we were after a long flight and were quick to bring us coffee and other refreshments. We got into our room immediately and fund it to be both comfortable and clean. We will be staying there again next year. Cheers to the staff.,5,2016,10,02
235,Excellent service,"We parked here last Saturday morning to go to the airport and we couldn't fault it. Dropped the car off and went in to wait for the bus as we were early. We were delighted to be greeted before 4am with lovely coffee and tea by an absolute gentleman. He came back to get us just in time for the bus. Parking costs us less than the 4 coffees would have cost us elsewhere, a complete bargain! Was only a short drive from the hotel to the airport and the driver even loaded and unloaded our bags for us. (None of that do it yourself bus Eireann business). When we landed on Wednesday night we were picked up by the soundest bus driver any of us has ever encountered. Made rainy Dublin a little more pleasant on our return! Couldn't recommend this place enough. Excellent service just parking the car, would gladly stay here :) ",5,2016,09,30
235,One night stay before travelling on for wedding,"Stayed for one night after flying into Dublin and picking up a hired car,
arrived at the Metro easy parking and not far from the airport, pleasant staff on reception who accommodated some requests sent before by e mail, rooms large very clean modern style with a very comfortable bed.
Perhaps not located in the best area for walking around but this did not effect us, it was maybe only 15 minute drive into the centre of Dublin and other attractions, i would stay here again in the future.",4,2016,09,27
235,Not as close to the airport as they advertise,"The hotel is a €13 taxi trip away from the airport. Rooms are modern and small, showers are lovely and staff are unqualified and not trained well. The restaurant is nice, service is bad, but when you get your food its nice.
The hotel is uncomfortably warm. The shuttle bus is €5 pp to the airport, when we took it was 10mins late leaving as guests were late and it was nowhere to be seen at the airport - so book in advance.",3,2016,09,26
235,Amazing Value and Comfort,"I arrived in late from UK absolutely exhausted one night. Was picked up at the airport by the courtesy bus and dropped to the hotel within a few short minutes. The reception staff were incredibly efficient and polite on my arrival and had me checked in within minutes. My room was so lovely,cosy and quiet I could have slept for a week in the comfy bed !! It was absolutely spotless and smelt really fresh, the cleaning staff must be praised for this. I got up early next morning and had a lovely Irish breakfast which kept me fuelled for the morning. The restaurant area has a very relaxed feel to it with good views of the outside as you eat. I must say that I got such a good feeling for this hotel, and having seen how clean it was and at such a good price that I will definitely be returning next month when in Dublin for a 3 day business conference. Thanks Metro Staff!

235,OK for one night (maybe)...,"The hotel was located on a busy intersection about a ten minute drive from the airport.  The room was small but comfortable enough apart from the heat.  There was no air conditioning and I could not open a window because of the noise of the all-night traffic which was loud even with the window closed.  If you are used to such noise then it would not be a problem but I was not so found it impossible to sleep.  Complimentary tea and coffee facilities were available but, due to the heat, a small bottle of water would have been very welcome.  I found the staff to be pretty much as you would expect to find in a hotel chain - just doing their job and being neither friendly nor unfriendly.  You have to pay for the shuttle bus which dropped us away from the terminals which I only found by following everyone else.  On a positive note, the hotel was fairly close to the airport and the restaurant, although a little expensive, looked nice.   All in all the hotel was ok for one night but I wouldn't recommend it or stay there again.",3,2016,09,23
235,Stay away ,"Worst hotel , bar food vile so dried out never get the beef burger it was a repeat , the breakfast is not included in paying for for a double room 159€, and no curtsy bus if you want to pay 10€ that is, the breakfast was vile so dried out and cremated and was only done 10 mins after it started , will never stay again , biggest rip off !!!! ",1,2016,09,22
235,"Poor odour, a little disappointed","The room smelt odd, like there was a bathroom plus old cigarette smoke odour they could not get out (was a non-smoking room). Rooms comfortable, and convenient to the airport. Staff were friendly enough, but not outstanding.",3,2016,09,19
235,Excellent One Night Stay,"Arrived on 20-08-16 at Dublin Airport at 8:30pm from Dubai.
Found it very difficult to locate the hotel airport shuttle stop.
I rang the hotel to get directions and then the stop was difficult to find in the pouring rain and the dark.
Apparently there is a location map on the hotel's website which I did not see, 
so that is my problem. 
I should have done more research to locate the correct shuttle stop.
Staff at check in were very pleasant and our party of four adults were upgraded to a two bedroom apt on an upper floor of the hotel.
The apt was excellent.
It was shame it was only a one night stay.
Dinner in the hotel bar area was great.
Food served was delicious and reasonably priced and the staff and service were very efficient.
Buffet breakfast offered many hot and cold food choices and was great value for money.
A bus stop for the bus into central Dublin was a short walk from the hotel
and it ran very frequently.
Airport shuttle was very efficient and the drive to the airport was about 10 minutes.
Excellent shuttle drivers were in attendance.
I would definitely return to this hotel if I was ever back in Dublin.",5,2016,09,18
235,A bit sterile but a surprising restaurant,"Overworked staff and an uninventive atmosphere, this is still a good place to get to the airport quick.  A shuttle service is provided for $5E.  The surprise was the restaurant.  Friends ordered the stuffed chicken expecting typical lackluster hotel food and got a beautiful presentation and tasty treat.  Not the best meal of the trip but pretty darn good.  The rooms were a bit small but the bath was nice sized.  If you need its location, the Metro is okay but stick with the B&Bs.",4,2016,09,17
235,Stayed here for a night before flying to Las Vegas,"We stayed here for 1 night as part of the park and fly package before we flew to Las Vegas. I agree with other people when they say that the area is a little rough but that was a minor detail. We were able to park in their secure underground carpark for a week while we were on holiday. The actual hotel inside is very good, the receptionist was very plesent and sorted out our parking tickets etc with no hassle. Our room was very spacious and clean and done our job for the night. The only downside was it was very warm in the room and we didnt have any a/c. We had to catch the shuttle bus at 4am to the airport and this all went smoothly and the reception offered tea and coffee while waiting on the shuttle. The journey to the airport took about 5 minutes overall, there was an option of taking the shuttle back to the hotel on the way home for free but we were so tired that we just jumped into a taxi instead. I wouldnl definatly use this hotel again in the future for staying before a holiday. ",4,2016,09,15
235,Airport parking,"I used the airport carparking facility only. I previously always used bewleys/""clayton"" for this service, I thought I would try the Metro as it is much cheaper, but and I will be returning to the Clayton in the future. I was on my way up from the country to get a flight on a Friday morning,in the Metro hotel you don't pre-pay, you have to get out of your car, go into hotel to pay, then drive car to the next building to park. That's all grand if you are not in a hurry, but you are always in a hurry to get to a flight.",3,2016,09,14
235,Two night stay,"From the outside hotel doesn't look great.
But, wow!
Great hotel
Staff extremely friendly and helpful
Thanks Fredricka and all your staff
Very good restaurant menu
Rooms very modern & comfortable 
Look forward to coming back soon",5,2016,09,12
235,Don't Judge A Book by its cover or a Hotel by its location,"Stayed A full weekend at this hotel as part of the Management of the Leinster Hockey Team. First off let me just say that I'd heard a lot of bad negative things from others regarding this hotel and my expectation was with fear if anything, especially given the reputation of location. However all the negative press couldn[t have been further from the truth. Right From Check in it felt as if We were in Luxury. Upon check in my room was upgraded to a suite. All the rooms and the restaurant were newly refurbished and very clean and modern. We had Meeting rooms booked as well and they were stocked with water and stationary for the team. We ate dinner at the Hotel one of the nights and the food was very good. Overall the hotel was perfect, gave us everything we needed and was a great location as only 200 metres from our Training Pitch, and 15 minute drive from the Tournament pitch In Donnabate. Never judge by its location! Honestly an amazing hotel on the inside! Highly reccomended if flying out of Dublin Airport as there is a shuttle bus too!",5,2016,09,12
235,Excellent service ,"Stopped here (room 420) on route to a wedding further a field. First impression was that the location wasn't the greatest, but on entering the hotel we were greeted by Frederica who was brilliant and very informative and even paid for our taxi from the airport because the next shuttle bus was about 45 mins away. The room was very clean and had everything we needed. The food in the restaurant was very good and again every member of staff delivered fantastic service from bar staff to restaurant staff. Ian at reception at night was very helpfully with our enquiries too. At breakfast we had the pleasure of Rakish and another staff member who I think was Polish, who again with every member of staff we met were all first class. I would highly recommend  this hotel to anybody looking for excellent accommodation with first class customer service. We wouldn't hesitate in booking this hotel on future visits to Dublin. Thank you to every member of staff for delivering  genuine service.",5,2016,09,06
235,Hotel stay,"Booked into the Metro hotel as we had booked our car into their car park as we were traveling to Las Vegas from Dublin,from we pulled up outside the hotel they were fab with everything,from parking the car to getting out fab room,then dinner in the bar was great,so the over all service was fantastic and we will be staying here again,",5,2016,09,02
235,GREAT STAFF. Clean Comfortable Room. Little bit pricey for location. ,"This was quite a quick visit with only needing to put my head down for 4/5 hours. €107 for single occupancy - a bit cheeky. I booked online via Trip Advisor and Booking.com. Cheapest price available even against the hotels own website. 

That said when I arrived at the hotel at 1am I was greeted by very friendly and kind staff. Check in was swift and very straight forward. Tomak was one of the staff and was very helpful with bags and parking my car and generally just a chatty friendly guy.

The room was spacious, clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom again was spacious, clean had a really decent sized shower. The water pressure could be better though. 

For the two lovely staff alone I'd recommend the hotel even though it's a bit off the airport complex. It's about five minutes drive to the Airport's Blue Zone Car Park.  I still think the price was a bit rich for one person though. ",4,2016,08,27
235,Pretty good,"Pretty decent, seems to be built on the template of Premier Inn.

Staff were very friendly, bar service was good. Pretty much can't complain besides these couple of things:

1) no hairdryer? Very surprised by the lack of this obvious and standard amenity. As I couldn't fly with wet hair it meant not washing my hair before travelling which was a bit rubbish. 
(Also no air conditioning whatsoever - I know it's Ireland, I'm Irish myself so the need for air con is infrequent, but this was a really hot day and night in August so I barely slept a wink because it was too hot.)

2) the shuttle bus is a really good service... once you've found it. Not at all simple to locate. 
Took a good 20-30 minutes to find where the ""coaches"" leave from. A lot of the airport staff had never even heard of Metro Hotel. 
When we finally found the coach depot, the big hotel chains had their shuttle timetables posted inside a large message board. Nothing whatsoever from Metro. 
Not exactly confidence inspiring and a poor first impression. The shuttle bus was a mini bus, lovely friendly driver, but again just a tiny A4 page sellotaped inside the bus window was how you identified this was the bus for Metro Hotel.

Overall impression was good and I would stay here again. Would also recommend to family or friends but would include the same info here re: bus and lack of hairdryer.",3,2016,08,23
235,Good hotel,"Very modern hotel with a good service including restaurant and all day service,
The room are good size although our room was slightly smaller than expected 
The shuttle bus is very good especially the driver they're helpful and polite 
The staff are pleasent and helpful,
There is a regular bus service to the centre and different areas specially the botanic garden,
My only advice to the hotel is the carpet in the lift areas need replacing,
Will stay again in the future",4,2016,08,22
235,We liked it!,"It's an airport hotel, meant for convenience not ambience. We stopped here on our first day in Ireland to get over jet leg. They were extremely accommodating, allowing us an early check-in. Dan at the desk and Elena and Marc in the dining room were very friendly and extremely helpful. There's a restaurant and bar in the hotel where they serve a full breakfast for €11. Other pubs and restaurants about 1 km away and easily walkable. We would come back!!",5,2016,08,19
235,Good hotel---bad area.,"We were pretty freaked out before going on. It's surrounded by what appears to be ""project"" type housing. Did not seem safe. We were just staying one night before we flew out. It was fine once in, nothing special but staff was nice, Guinness in the bar with nice lounging couches that we could order food and just chill out. We wouldn't stay again because of the area, but it was ok. We looked at reviews before we booked and didn't hear anything about location and I think it bears mentioning. Other guests had the same comments when we were checking in.",3,2016,08,16
235,Don't stay,"OK where will I start.
1 room was perfect 
2 bar an food OK
3 step out of hotel an it's in a real rough area .
Upon check out an waiting for the bus to the airport we seen a dodgy looking young lad with a hat an scarf on pacing up and down next minute he races into reception an jumps the desk an robs the staff an fleas the crime seen never in my life have I been so scared .. so I suggest pay a little more an stay in a bigger hotel nearer to the airport an not in such a rough area..
Oh and the shuttle bus is five euro pp unlike other hotels where it's free.. 
",2,2016,08,14
235,Impressed ,"Stayed here as overnight stop before early flight next day . Have stayed in many other hotels near airport but this was first time in Metro . Very impressed from start to finish . I emailed from bus on way down in evening as wanted to confirm I was coming - and have heard horror stories of other hotels giving away rooms etc . 
Got an immediate reply , confirmation of my booking and advice re shuttle times . 
Check in was very friendly and efficient and even though it wasn't the member of staff that had emailed me , she recognised my name and stated she was pleased id got the earlier shuttle option - again impressed with attention to detail . I've had less friendly receptions in other ' rival ' hotels . 
Also arranging shuttle and wake up call for next day - efficient and exactly as described . 
The shuttle takes slightly longer and there is a fee for travelling back to the airport - ( transfer to the hotel is free) but in the end for the efficiency of the service I didn't mind paying for the transfer - and this was also paid for the night before , to allow a swift exit in am .
Room was very very clean ( and I'm fussy !!) and what looked like brand new shower ! In fact whole room recently refurbished to high standard . 
Overall very impressed and will make the first hotel I look at for future airport stays ! ",4,2016,08,10
235,Clean solid airport hotel,"Everything you need but nothing extra.  Clean, safe, had a decent restaurant and bar, comfortable rooms, wifi, cable, quiet rooms, everything worked, shuttle to the airport on the half hour starting at 4am.  Could see that there were pilots staying here.  Everything we needed.  Not fancy, but a great value.  I would definitely stay there again,",4,2016,08,08
235,Nice hotel ,"Stayed here for one night as a stopover before heading off from Dublin airport .... Rooms were good size and clean. Bus stop outside that made it easy to get into Dublin city centre or taxi was €18. 
Only disappointment was transfer back to hotel to pick up the car didn't turn up at time it was meant too which meant we waited for 50 mins to get picked up ... Not really what you want after a long flight etc ",5,2016,08,06
235,Goods better,Food is beer than last trip here. Staff however are farcical.  Takes about 30 mins to order a drink and the bar is near empty. Ordered a Heineken shandy and got a csrlsberg shandy and got charged for the full pint and the mixer as well. I said this to the guy serving and he said he used the full short so he charged. Honestly in general the worst general staff I have ever experienced in a hotel.,1,2016,08,04
235,Convenient and affordable for travel from Dublin Airport.,"On two separate occasions during July 2016 my wife and I spent a night in this hotel. On the first occasion we were meeting our son and his family arriving from Vancouver,Canada. We were driving a 17 seater hired minibus and had been promised that we could access overnight parking at the front of the hotel. The day before travel,I rang to check that mini bus parking could be accommodated. We were aware from an earlier stay that the bus could not be parked in the underground car park,owned by the hotel. This was because of height restrictions and we understood. The receptionist who took my call was decidedly unhelpful and said that the hotel was 9 percent over committed on parking availability and she couldn't guarantee parking for us. She advised that we parked the bus at the airport. I was annoyed that she wanted to talk assertively but not to listen. On arrival at the airport we parked in the short stay Plus car park and took the hotel shuttle bus to the hotel. On arrival at The Metro we discovered much availability for parking and after paying the parking fee at the airport we were rather annoyed. We felt that a parking space for the bus could have been reserved had the will been there.
We were checked in by a really friendly receptionist who could not have been more helpful. When we explained our problem she put a flag on our booking for a minibus parking space for two weeks later when we were returning for a stay over prior to our family's return to Canada. We enjoyed our stay in a comfortable room and had an excellent evening meal.
On our return with our family including two young children we had a totally different experience regarding parking our bus. The male receptionist was a great help,checked us all in in a friendly,welcoming manner and ensured that our transport was properly parked for the night.
We had a delicious family meal,a great night's sleep and super breakfast. The staff in the restaurant were so friendly and especially a young man from Madrid. His customer service was excellent.
Our family took the morning shuttle to the airport and we said our emotional goodbyes at the hotel. Much easier!
All in all we had a great experience at The Metro and would stay again. Just a pity about the attitude of the girl on the telephone during our telephone conversation to check out the parking issue!",4,2016,08,03
235,Ok but not by any means great,"Shuttle to the airport is only free going from the airport to the hotel the other way you must pay.
No air conditioning in rooms.
Hall carpets are pretty gross. The rooms themself are quite nice except for the no air.",2,2016,08,02
235,Short stay,"Close to the airport, we stayed here twice for a couple of nights in between tours. Great facilities, restaurant and rooms. Staff were welcoming and happy to help with any enquiries and arranging all of our transfers. Would stay here again.",4,2016,07,31
235,Dublin Hotel,"My room was comfy, nice and neat, the bathroom was perfect. The staff is friendly and very helpful. They can help you in your mother language as well. Nice place for families, couples or single travelers, close to the airport, mall and shops. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2016,07,31
235,Great stay,"Arrived at the metro about midnight to find our room had someone in it all ready lol. Asked to wait 15 mins new room sorted and as a goodwill gesture 50% off the nightly room rate. Food great, staff really friendly and helpful.  Breakfast I had 2 rounds of sausages and bacon and left full. Rooms clean, beds very comfy and overall great stay was had. ",5,2016,07,30
235,Over night stay ,"Stayed here recently, very professional hotel with really good facilities, really helpful and welcoming staff , restaurant also provides top class food that cannot be faulted, it's only a five minute drive from the airport and also provided parking.",4,2016,07,27
235,Mrs Beaumont,"Fantastic hotel, great location as it's near Airport and near Dublin city centre. Stayed here 3 nights, beds are super comfy, rooms have all the facilities you need and nicely decorated. First night we had early bird menu, which was fantastic and great value for money. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Defo recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,26
235,Good in a pinch !,"Stayed for one night in July,found room to be very clean but small.We were rushed in at check in due to long line and due to the fact that out of the three people working the check in the lady on the left was not helping the other employees but was chatting on the phone on a personal call.I noticed this woman was the only one that had a additional lamp and a small fan on her desk.The waitress in the lounge area did her best to avoid taking any orders by keeping her head down when she moved between tables to avoid eye contact with customers to avoid work.The housekeeping staff was very friendly and performed well. Overall I would not stay here in the future the staff seemed unhappy, tired and overwhelmed.",3,2016,07,25
235,The best airport hotel,"I've stayed here twice now,and loved it both times. The staff are lovely,the shuttle bus driver (the Dublin guy)entertaining to say the least! Now,the food isn't great,but fine,the beds very comfy and its very quiet,good breakfast and reasonably priced.",5,2016,07,25
235,Handy for Airport and Port,"Stayed overnight before departing and found it pleasant and clean and the bar and restaurant were efficient and staff friendly.
Parking is underground and has to be accessed by a card from reception which can make thing a bit awkward when arriving as a group of motorcyclists, as we found!! Overall though, a positive experience",4,2016,07,24
235,Would not like to stay here again,"Our room smelled like smoke and didn't seem too clean. This may have been our fault, but we assumed free airport transfer, since the point of staying there was to be near the airport. It wasn't free and it didn't seem too focused on leaving on time. We were on the first shuttle (I think 4am) and needed to get there ASAP.

We only were there for dinner and to sleep, so it wasn't worth making a big deal about, but if there are comparably priced hotels near the airport, I'd choose a different one next time.",2,2016,07,17
235,Quick Visit,"Nice hotel, staff were friendly and very helpful. Very handy if you have an early flight. The hotel has a shuttle bus to bring you to the airport cheaper than a taxi, very clean, didn't eat there. The lady at the reception very friendly and helpful ",4,2016,07,17
235,Nice ,The room was lovely and comfortable and it had a huge shower. The decor made the room more relaxing. The girl on reception was friendly and helpful. It is Near the airport and there is a shuttle bus for it also. I just felt that it was too expensive. ,4,2016,07,13
235,Excellent hotel,"We stayed there for 1 night before our flight.
The staff are friendly and helpful, The bar at the lobby was great and the coffee was tasty. 
Next to the hotel there's public transportation to the city center and temple bar.
The hotel offers a transport to the airport service.

The room was very clean, comfortable and big.",5,2016,07,13
235,The 9th of July 2016 - Fantastic!,"My sister in law, niece and myself stayed at the metro on Saturday night. We had travelled up for a concert at Croke Park. I would highly recommend this hotel when travelling to Dublin. The price was great, €139 for three of us. Parking was €4 overnight. The staff were fabulous and very helpful by showing us how to get to Croke Park (a bus ride away). We had lunch/dinner in Bistro 9 and it was a lovely meal and so reasonable (€31 for three of us to eat). Service was excellent at all times. The room was modern, adequately sized and the beds were comfy, what more could you want! If ye are looking to come to Dublin - Stay at the Metro!! ",5,2016,07,11
235,Nothing Not To Like,"I booked a single room for my one night trip away and it was fine.  Although the outside of the building looked a little dated, the internal decor and fixtures and fittings were very good,  The bathroom facilities were excellent - I loved the shower cubicle and oh, what joy, a shower that didn't require an instruction manual to operate.  The room was well appointed and the flat screen tv worked fine.  In addiiton to the hairdryer and the tea/coffee making facilities the room also housed a (FREE) safe.  Again - no instruction handbook required. All the staff I encountered were polite, professional and friendly.  Having opted for the 11 Euros buffet-style breakfast I have to say that I enjoyed it.  Plenty of choice, freshly prepared and very tasty. I recommend it.",5,2016,07,10
235,lovely hotel,this hotel was lovely and for the price i thought it was great 50 euros for two of us 1 night. we only stayed as we had to be at the airport early the next day. they have a bus the takes you to the airport for 5 euros. food was good but there wasn't anything to done in the hotel or near it.,5,2016,07,07
235,A very enjoyable stay,"As our flight was cancelled we arrived at the Metro without any reservations, just walked in with my bride.

Check in was fast and within a few minutes we were in our room. There must have been a major overhaul since last May when I already spent a night at the Metro! The room was clean, modern and stylish, the bathroom was spacious with a mirror big enough for an elephant to look at itself. The tea and coffee making facility was very handy too. When it comes to the bed, everyone has their own preference- as for ours, we found it comfortable

The night receptionist - Kasia - was very, very friendly and helpful, when we told her that our flight leaves late at night she allowed us to stay until 2 PM which was a massive help for us! Overall she really went that extra mile as well as the French guy at the restaurant (manager?). Very friendly staff, good job Metro!

In summary, it was a surprisingly enjoyable experience after last year's ""forgettable"" one, I believe the Metro has improved a lot, offering great value for the money.

If I can point out one thing which we did not like, was the fact that the shuttle bus to the airport was not complimentary (like at other nearby ""airport"" hotels).",4,2016,07,06
235,A good hotel but dreadful service in restaurant,"This is a good quality hotel. It's clean, about 15 mins to the airport and well maintained. It is a little in "" the middle of nowhere "". So the restaurant has a captive audience. In synopsis the food is good hotel food. BUT the service is dire. Tonight my starter ( smoked salmon) took thirty minutes to arrive. A sparkling water took 15 minutes followed by 10 minutes for a second bottle. If you pay on arrival for your accommodation the restaurant will not bill your room..you must pay the restaurant separately    attitude of staff is brusque  forgetful and slow .Overall a bad advertisement for visitors... The food is good the experience needs serious improvement. Decent management required... This place was very good.",3,2016,07,05
235,Overnight stay to catch a flignt,"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel! The bathroom is great and very spacious. The beds were comfortable (we had a double room). The staff was so polite especially as we arrived at 3.00 am and had to be up at 7 to catch the international flight back to the U.S. The shuttle does not run after midnight, so we had to take a taxi. We understood this and so when our flight was delayed by hours, we pulled out cash from the ATM. It was about 16 euros. I know some taxis do not take cards, so make sure to tell them before you get in. We used the shuttle to get back at 8:30 am and the young man at the front desk was able to put it on our reservation and gave us the cards. I would definitely stay here again and for much longer!",5,2016,06,30
235,Close to airport and good restaurant,"A mixup in our reservation forced us to book the Metro Hotel right before we needed to stay there. It ended up being very convenient to the Dublin airport. There is a charge for parking (4 Euros) and for breakfast (12 Euros). The wifi is free and worked fine. The minor complaint we had about room was that the bathroom door couldn't be propped open and had to be kept closed and only one of our key cards worked. You likely will  have to wait at reception though, since large groups often check in individually (we got behind two groups that each needed to check in for multiple rooms). Other than those minor issues, the staff and facilities were good. 

We got there about 19:00 and decided to just eat at the restaurant on the ground floor, where our food was excellent and is served until 22:00. We stuck around in the lounge after dinner for drinks, which were priced fair for the Dublin area.",4,2016,06,30
235,Excellent,"We found this quite nice hotel a number of years ago and stay here routinely our last night before flying home the next morning. The price is quite reasonable. This year the rooms were redecorated-----always there have been good mattresses, extras, quiet, good plumbing----you name it. Staying here is worth it also for just the convenience of the very efficient airport shuttle service. The shuttle is superb (book, for time needed,  at the reception desk of the hotel) The city bus service to and from downtown Dublin is excellent (the reception desk will give you a time schedule). This year we ate supper in the hotel dining area and were pleased with our meals. We also observed others meals and concluded the chef was doing a great job. Waiter had some diffiuclties with using English however.",5,2016,06,30
235,Overnight Stay,"We had two rooms booked and they did not disappoint, Check in was slow as a tour bus arrived just before we did.  The bar/restaurant was busy, my husband ordered a pint of Guinness  which was half filled and quickly payment requested from the not so welcoming bar man, he then proceeded to finish filling the pint glass by back filling the pint, ( a training lesson needed here) We ordered dinner and after retiring to our room spent the night watching my teenage son vomit, This left a disappointing and worrying thought in our minds so I followed up the next day after getting my son treated.....  lets say after three emails and two phone calls I received an email from the manager titled ""Without Prejudice"" I had telephoned and emailed to say that if possible could the beer battered cod be checked.  We had hoped to speak to the manager the morning we were checking out but reception was indeed very busy and the receptionist was on the phone at this stage we just want to get our son to a chemist and some treatment.  Will we be returning no in general we felt when we tried to contact the hotel we could not get a full and proper response to our concerns but rather a very official email denying any liability in relation to my sons illness.  The bar staff that evening were disorganized and lacked bar staff skills three times we requested menus.  It is a stop over hotel for an airport........",3,2016,06,29
235,Good hotel,Comfortable room. Close to the airport. It has WiFi. Parking is available at a good price. Good transportation to Dublin city centre by bus. Shuttle to the airport. Has a bar and restaurant. Staff were helpful,3,2016,06,29
235,Really Welcoming,"This was a one night stay before flying out of Dublin Airport early the next morning. From the time we got on the shuttle to the time we left next morning, our stay was great. The front desk staff immediately made us feel at home.
The room was beautiful with a comfy bed and a remodelled bath, and everything was spotless. The room was very warm due to an extended warm weather almost unheard of for June in Ireland, but a call to the front desk resulted in a fan brought to our door.
There is free Wifi in the rooms, and a desktop computer near the lobby that you need to pay for to get internet access. The printer was not working when we were there but the young man on the front desk went above and beyond to print our boarding passes for us.
The restaurant (Bistro 9) was lovely with great service and good food.
The overall price and wonderful service made this hotel one which I would highly recommend.",5,2016,06,21
235,Overnight Stay,"This is a great hotel.  It is about 5 minutes from the airport so if you are flying out early or arriving late, it's a great place to stay.  Rooms are nice and they have a bar/restaurant right there and it stays open late.  Would stay there again.",5,2016,06,20
235,A great airport hotel!,"Stayed for one night on the 11th June. From the moment I arrived at the hotel the service was amazing -At reception, from the porters, in the restaurant and on the courtesy shuttle bus the friendliness of all really stood out.
Stayed in a triple room which was very roomy with all the mod cons I look for in a hotel e.g. Tea/coffee, safe, iron etc.  The food in the bar was superb. I would highly recommend the Metro hotel as a dining venue alone. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend the hotel to all travellers.  Parking is extremely reasonable and secure. The airport shuttle operates efficiently to/from airport.  The hotel is less than 5 mins drive from IKEA and M50 making it very accessible.",5,2016,06,19
235,First impressions not great,"My first impression of this hotel were not great from the outside to the Car park which is situated away from the hotel in another area and building it was not what I expected I would not feel safe going to the car park at night . Once you deal with the car park and enter the hotel the rooms are a very good size and very clean.The bar area is good with many tv screens the staff in the bar area are friendly.The food is not great very basic the room menu is better than the bar food more options.
",3,2016,06,19
235,Fine Hotel,"I spent two nights here.
I arrived for a very late check in but had no problems since the front desk seems to be manned 24/7.
My room was a little warm and one phone call provided a room fan which solved the problem.
The room was clean and the bathroom spotless.
Television in the room.
WiFi is free and very fast.
I also dined here and was well satisfied. Zippy service, nice restaurant atmosphere and relaxed surroundings.
The breakfast was well laid out and plentiful and you had the choice of also ordering a hot breakfast meal.
The hotel is close to the airport and there is a shuttle bus service.
A bus service into town starts from a stop 5 minutes from the hotel.
There was a little hiccup with my bill, but one phone call solved the matter and I received a lovely letter of apology from the Front Office Manager, Ms Oldani who was all extremely helpful when I called about the matter.
I will be returning.",5,2016,06,19
235,Basic stay (and basically good),"Our family stayed one night on a layover from SFO to MAD.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was small, basic and clean.  We missed the last shuttle due to a delay so needed to spend €15 on a taxi from the airport.  Shuttle starts from 4am so very convenient.  Hotel does not have a lot of warmth or charm, but for the price, what can one expect.",4,2016,06,16
235,Beautiful!,"Booked this hotel for one night, a cheap stop before heading to the airport for an early morning flight. I wasn't expecting much because of the lower price compared to every other airport hotel but it was lovely! Staff were very helpful, room was beautiful, clean, comfy and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin and they even offer an airport shuttle bus starting at 4 am!  Bus drivers were very friendly and chatty. 10/10 keep it up!",5,2016,06,15
235,Pleasantly Surprised ,"Travelled to our head office recently and always avoid this place given its location. All other hotels were booked up in the airport area and I really was out of options, so I took the plunge....

The entrance area and lifts etc.... Didn't do too much to quell my fears, but the receptionist was fantastic, conducted my business in a quick and friendly way.

Got to my room, really couldn't believe it, it was finished a hell of a lot better than some hotels which claim to be 4 star and was spotlessly clean. The bed was also fantastic and slept like a baby all night.

Unfortunately I was exhausted and pretty much went straight to sleep so didn't get to check out the bar or restaurant...

I definitely won't have any apprehension if I need to book here again, and if you need a good nights sleep, you'll definitely get it here.",4,2016,06,15
235,Excellent Hotel. Great Value For Money,"We stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to Dublin airport. From the time we checked in until the time we left, the service was exemplary. The staff really went the extra mile to make you feel at home. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and also had a couple of drinks at the bar. The food was excellent. There were lots of choices on the menu and all at reasonable prices, especially for a hotel. The taste and presentation were superb and the wait staff a pleasure. It would have been nice if the bar offered Irish craft beers either on draft or in bottle.
The room was modern and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable. The free wifi was crap.",4,2016,06,15
235,Perfect location and great customer service,"We stayed here on 2 separate occasions and both times the customer service was exemplary.  For our second stay, I tried to book online but was unable to find any rooms.  I was able to chat with Katie J.,  who went over and above to accommodate us - finding us a two-bed/two bath apartment within the hotel.  I would like to say thank-you to Katie again, we really appreciated all that you did for us. 

Our room the first stay was lovely and very clean and modern.  We asked for an early wake up call and we did receive one.   

We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was very nice - the food was good and reasonably priced. 

Shuttle to the airport was on time and efficient.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,14
235,Dublin Aiport hotel,Stayed in this hotel a few times when it was Days hotel. Hotel is clean and staff is helpful. Bus to aiport is 5e each way. Ring an hour beforehand to book bus in case it is filled up. My flight this time was late so had to get a taxi which was ridiculously overpriced 22.80.,4,2016,06,12
235,Viva las vegas ,Overnight stay in Dublin before flying out and the hotel was fab. Really helpful and great rooms. The food in restaurant was very nice. Defo use again. Plus very convenient hotel shuttle. Booking in was easy and overall ambience was good,5,2016,06,09
235,Great,"Stayed over night after flying back from Tenerife, arrived at the hotel at 12:30 am, staff were so friendly, rooms are clean, beds are comfy. Everything you need in room.

Staff in this hotel are lovely, great coffees in the bistro. They also provide a shuttle bus to and from the airport. ",5,2016,06,09
235,Concert in Croke Park,"Found this hotel to be reasonably priced, spotless with completely refurbished rooms, good food and helpful friendly staff. My only issue was like another reviewer the lack of a residents bar,  having arrived after 11 pm it would have been nice to be able to relax with a drink especially for the designated driver .",4,2016,06,08
235,A place to sleep but,I stayed in this hotel for a night due to a late flight arrival which interrupted my onward journey. The price was good and the room was fine. However it was a very poor lookout that I could not get a drink on arrival as I was told that I was too late for the bar. I told the nice receptionist that I was unable to leave the aircraft until it had landed and I could not get to the hotel on time to comply with the bar closing times. A first impression on reaching the hotel was some obvious broken car glass on the ground quite near the front door. Also I noticed that their shuttle bus was parked in full view right at the front door and that area was also well lit,3,2016,06,06
235,Ideal location,"We travelled up from Cork to spend the day in Ashbourne and with IKEA planned for the next day we found this hotel which could not have been better as we could see IKEA from our room. Surprisingly nice hotel, seems to have been recently refurbished. Just be aware however there is heavy traffic all night directly outside the hotel so not great for light sleepers. We did have one complaint about our shower which we were unable to use the following morning as it was scalding hot and could not turn the temp down. Reported this to reception however simply got a sorry. Disappointing when we a bed and shower are the two fundamentals when staying in a hotel room. Overall very nice and would recommend.",4,2016,06,05
235,Bruce Concert in May'16,"We stayed for one night, the hotel seemed out of the way but it proved convenient for us overall.   The staff at reception were lovely and very helpful in so far as Bus times into town, the cost and other options.   The food was nice, tasty and we did'nt have to wait too long.  After a long night, but very enjoyable concert. we got back to hotel at about 11.oopm and just wanted to chill out with a few drinks to wind down.   Unfortunately, we were told that no residence bar was available after 11.30pm !!  It was the only crib i would have with the hotel.  Surely for residents they could have stayed open a bit longer.  Other than this issue,I would recommend the hotel for friendly staff, food and the room was spotless.",4,2016,06,04
235,one night stay 9th May,"We stayed in this hotel prior to flight,  had dinner on arrival.  Room was very nice, beds very comfortable.   Staff very professional and friendly.   Courtesy bus took us to airport ...bus runs every half hour,   friendly driver. Would highly recommend this hotel,   food excellent.",5,2016,06,03
235,Top class,"Stayed here on Sunday night with 5 friends, using 3 rooms.  The staff could not have been more helpful and the rooms were spotless, comfortable and quite large with a large flat screen TV and comfortable beds.   We had lunch in the lounge and it was very good at reasonable prices.  The only minor complaint is that, unlike most hotels, the bar does not stay open for residents beyond regular pub hours.",5,2016,05,31
235,Two nights of effective and friendly service,Stayed for Springsteen concert - friendly welcome - efficient reception even when we arrived back very late - decent breakfast and rooms - nice bar with TV and good food - efficient and cheap airport shuttle -it's only 20 euros into town by taxi and we enjoyed the stay.,4,2016,05,31
235,Great airport hotel,"We arrived late at night for Bruce Springsteen show the next night. All the hotels in town had increased their prices so much that we chose an airport hotel. It was very nice - clean rooms, very efficient check in, comfortable beds. Would definitely recommend.",4,2016,05,29
235,great stay near airport,"We stayed at the Metro to be closer to the airport for our departure from Dublin.  We would like to commend the Hotel for a going beyond our expectations in hospitality.  
First, the emails to confirm our stay were very handy as we were juggling a number of different stays and the reminders were appreciated.  Secondly, we knew that there was not going to be much for restaurants in the area so we were pleasantly pleased with the Metro's cafe and meals. The food was delicious and the service from Rakish the best!!  Thirdly, the hotels decor and architecture modern, clean and relaxing.  I appreciated that the window opened for fresh air.  We slept quite well as the bed was comfortable and the room quiet.  Lastly, the staff really did go the extra mile to be helpful-from Mark who greeted us each day,  to the front desk staff who helped us with our boarding passes and the need for an umbrella, to Rakish in the cafe who put a smile on my face with his graciousness.  We made use of the airport shuttle-a real plus as well.  Great place and stay!  Thank you so very much!",5,2016,05,26
235,So so,Staff were friendly. We chose it for location near airport. The bedroom was too warm. Difficult to control heating. Parking is in an adjacent car park which goes under the hotel. It has nothing over and above other similar hotels nearby. I would not be in a big rush back. ,3,2016,05,18
235,a  class  act   and  near  airport  and  IKEA,"The Metro Hotel as  I was going on a holiday to Lake  Garda in Italy the  following day, The staff at the  hotel were  first class and  nothing was  too much trouble and the shuttle to the airport was  prompt and  efficient. This hotel was easy to find just off the M50 and very close to IKEA which we walked to from the hotel. Some  hotels promise  so much but  deliver very  little, the  Metro as a hotel is  a class act  nice bar  fab  breakfast  excellent staff  and plenty space to park the  car for holiday duration. I  don’t know  who is the  manager  here  but whoever  it is sets the  template  as  to what a perfect hotel should  offer. Excellent hotel and I will be back sooner rather than later.

For  those  people using Dublin Airport and  the  shuttle bus  go to  the coach  zone 14 for your collection point. Collection  is on the  15 and  45 minutes every hour. During off peak times you may have to call hotel  on 01 866  9500. As  hotels  go  this  hotel is  a class act.",5,2016,05,13
235,If the manager would know his personnel; it could be a 5!,"Everything was organized and clean. I was able to meet all the people working there because I stayed for a week. But, there was this man named RAYAHK or something like that EXTREMELY: rude, arrogant, annoying. When he knew I disliked; he tried to compensate his attitude bringing me the food and I think this is acting in a sinical unprofessional manner. Then, he came every 5 minutes asking if everything was ok to the ones in the table besides. COME ON!",3,2016,05,12
235,Ideal hotel for a short visit,"This hotel is ideal for people using the airport or for a short stay. It has a small reception and bar/ restaurant downstairs. Our room looked recently decorated and was very clean. All the staff we met... receptionist, porter and waitress were very nice and very helpful. Breakfast was tasty and well laid out.",4,2016,05,10
235,our latest visit to a very homely non pretentious no frills hotel.,"we are always very pleased to visit this hotel. very nice rooms comfortable beds, tea and coffee making facilities, near the airport. we also like the bar/restaurant area. nice food and they serve a lovely pint of guinness.",5,2016,05,10
235,Pleasant surprise in Airport Wasteland,"The Metro Dublin Airport is staffed uniformly by warm, friendly, helpful people. The rooms are modern, affordable, spotless, and well-appointed. After a long day on the road and all the hassles of returning rental cars, etc., we were delighted to find the hotel restaurant still serving at 9:30 and the food fresh, good, and reasonably priced. Our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. What a relief!",5,2016,05,06
235,Wouldn't serve me an irish coffee because I'm in a wheelchair disabled,Wouldn't serve me an irish coffee because I'm in a wheelchair disabled . I though this was disrespectful and rude to just blank me when I asked why I was its because your disabled . I also asked to see a manager but they said I wouldn't because it's the rules nothing I can do or say .,1,2016,05,06
235,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night as we had an early flight out of Dublin. Used the Stay and park service. WE found the hotel excellent in every respect. The staff were extremely helpful and very professional as soon as we came to reception. WE also used the Restaurant which was excellent and very reasonable. I think approx €12 for a main course. We came back from our journey late at night and the Bus picked us up at Zone 14 (easy to find). The driver was very courteous. When we got to the hotel the Security Guard who was a Gentleman escorted us to our car in the underground car park, Have no problem recommending this Hotel",5,2016,04,30
235,A convenient place to stay when flying out of Dublin.,"We used this hotel on two separate days in April 2016. The ""Park and Fly"" system was very convenient. We spent a week in Fuerteventura before returning. Our car was parked in the underground car park. There are two - one close to the hotel and another a short walk away. We used the shuttle bus (2 euros each return when paying for the car park and 5 euros each if not parking) Shuttle runs every 1/2 hour to Zone 14 at the airport. On our return we found our driver,Michael,really helpful and cheerful. A real joy to meet!
Our check in experience on both occasions was friendly,efficient and fast. Front desk staff on both occasions were extremely helpful.
Our room on the first night was totally adequate,comfortable and quiet. On the second occasion we were ""upgraded"" to a suite which was great BUT the disabled bathroom in room 123 was awful. There was no shower pressure at all,nowhere to leave toiletries,tooth brush etc. It was a wet room with poor drainage and drying. There was a bigger bed in the suite than the room but there was greater traffic noise from the road. We wouldn't accept this room again!
We had our evening meals in the hotel bar on both occasions and the food and service were excellent. No complaints at all.
We have booked to stay here for two separate occasions in July 2016. Look forward to going back but we will be more careful in checking out the room we are allocated.",4,2016,04,28
235,Handy for Park and Fly,"We have used the Days Inn a couple of times.  Once we stayed there and once we just parked the car there.  On the occasion we stayed there, I have to say it was a basic hotel.  The lobby and bar would give the impression of a classy joint.  It is really comfortable and well presented.  The rooms however are really just the same as you would expect from the Ibis or somewhere.  Now, don't get me wrong; lovely place and clean, it could just do with modernising the rooms just a little bit.  In saying that, I definitely would stay again.",4,2016,04,26
235,Amazing service.,Daniel took such great care of us!  All of the staff were genuine and kind. We couldn't have asked for better service. We will always remember the way we were treated by the staff here!  They absolutely went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of!,5,2016,04,25
235,Good hotel,"Went for a short stay in Dublin. Staff was very nice and friendly,. The room was clean, tidy and  warm. Big bed, quite comfortable, you could regulate the temperature in the room. 
The bathroom was clean with a great shower. 
The restaurant and bar located downstairs was just fine, pity that dinner is served from 5pm,but you can get some food earlier too.
There is a grocery shop round the corner. 

Overall good value for money.",4,2016,04,25
235,in between,"yes this Hotel is an older One. and the cleanliness  can be better. But anyway it is not as worst as it sounds. It is ok on this pricelevel. Watch out, this Hotel has only 4 floors. If you like to see airplans landing take rooms from the nordside. rarely but you will hear a noice from the airplans and from the street. The location between airport and citycenter is also ok. The hotel shuttle cost you  5€ for both ways to the airport. to the city center it takes you app. 25min. Last bus (Nr. 4) towards the hotels runs at 22:30 h. No Pubs nearby except in the hotel.",3,2016,04,25
235,Disappointing WIFI conection,"You have to sign in in order to get access to the wifi service which doesn't allow you to send whatsapp messages for example. 
The stuff is OK, nothing specially awesome but they do their job just fine.",3,2016,04,24
235,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor, the room was very comfortable with modern décor and a lovely bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep.
The staff were very pleasant, friendly and very helpful, I was made feel very welcome. 
The hotel is not too far from the city about 20 /25 mins by bus which picks up close to the hotel.",5,2016,04,18
235,BEST FOR VALUE AND SERVICE,"Great value,great service ,great staff. When I arrived back at the airport,I rang the hotel to arrange for a shuttle pick up. The staff member told me that there would be a half hour delay due to driver tea break .He told me to get a taxi back and I would be reimbursed,which I duly was . Well done Metro Hotel. I'll be back!
",5,2016,04,16
235,B & K Given,For an overnight stay en route to airport this hotel was very good. We did not eat there so can't comment on food. The room was lovely and had all that we needed in it. Full marks for cleanliness. Reception was very friendly and the airport shuttle worked perfectly from the hotel door.,4,2016,04,16
235,Disappointing... unclean... rundown... avoid this one.,"I had 2 nights booked in the Metro, looks lovely on the website and close proximity to the business park which I needed. 

I was checked in by 2 guys who seemed like they were school kids working part time, chatting up one of the girls, phones out, gave me my key and told me I was upgraded to a ""Suite"". When I got to the room, at the end of tight and word down corridor, I immediately called reception for the Wifi and Breakfast info, as my conversation on checkin was so brief... the phone call was even shorter... I felt as if I was inconveniencing the lads at reception. 

Then... oh then, I took a look around the room. The air was warm and stale.. If this was the Suite, I would hate to see the standard room. The doors were lose and rattly, didn't really feel safe in the hotel. Anywhere there was furniture, the wall was damaged, paint chipping off. It was a disabled room so the bathroom was open, tiles missing from the floor and low levels of light... the only floor mat rolled up in the corner with a big long hair on it. 

The real icing on the cake was the bed, not only was it 2 singles pulled together... uncomfortably, it was covered in black hairs... more than a few hairs too and under the duvet too... fairly disgusting. I slept on one side of the bed, after wiping it down, with socks on and had the window open all night. 

For breakfast, it's not hard to have someone standing there to greet you or explain the story, I started getting some food and then was asked for my room number... not a big deal but annoying when it isn't clear how it works... the fruit was very poor, no bananas either. The cooked breakfast upset my stomach a little, which may be coincidence so I avoided it on day 2. 

The hotel is quiet and ideal locationally, but wasn't that clean, looked run down and I dreaded staying there again so much that I've actually moved hotel for my next trip to Dublin. €70 euro a night is a bit much for this... completely unacceptable unless you're stuck for a place to stay and can't afford anything else around. The place is running, but seems like nobody is concerned with upkeep or standards.",2,2016,04,15
235,"Great location, Friendly helpful staff, Good Value.","Had a very comfortable night at the hotel. We had a room for 3 adults for 1 night and 7 days parking for €115.
The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. We had a functional room which was clean and beds were very comfortable.
We had a very nice meal 2 courses and a glass of wine for €15 each and the food was tasty and nicely presented.We got our wake up call as requested and were given a free coffee while waiting for our bus. Airport Bus schedule given to us by the hotel was on time. The bus drivers on both journeys were so helpful and loaded and unloaded our bags. We were really impressed with the efforts made by the staff.
The hotel is easy to get to from the M50 which is another advantage.
Will definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,14
235,Great for last minute deals...,"Ended up staying here as couldnt find anything else in the city 7 to be honest I'm glad I did, great hotel, lovely & clean - makes all the difference.  Great for the airport as they have a shuttle service and bus stop to the city is directly outside - thankyou",4,2016,04,12
235,"Stay somewhere else - bad policies, extra charge for everything, bad nights sleep","I would not stay here again, unless it was about €30.  I was stranded at the airport in the middle of the night - turns out there is NO shuttle after 12 even if flights are still coming in.  I walked 4 miles in the middle of the night to get here on dark roads with no side walk (not the hotel's fault - but as I assumed I had a shuttle I had no Euro for a taxi).

The beds are very stiff and a green light that can not be turned off glows all night long.  Nice black out curtains on the window but useless in the case.  The room also buzzes while your room key has power running to it.

To top it all off - breakfast is not included as I obviously wrongly assumed.  Staff is friendly enough but obviously very used to ignoring custom comments and complains.

However the shuttle driver is really really nice when I needed to go back to the airport the next morning.",2,2016,04,11
235,Rip off,"Charge over 3€ for a coffee, tea in a take away cup - it is always half full, and when asked if it can be filled up the response is that's what came out of the machine. Scandalous and a rip off... Not impressed at all",1,2016,04,08
235,A great Stay,"Stayed here in February for a night,
i was going to Spain for a weekend and stopped here for the night before for the following reasons
+ was flying out at 4am, this amazing hotel has a coach to the airport, and they kept my car for 2 days for only 12 euro.
+parking, they have two great underground safe car parks,
+ the value, with my nights stay and leaving my car it only set me back €79 euro that`s amazing,

on top of all that it was a wonderful hotel.
clean, well decorated, amazing staff,

i cant recommend it highly enough, i have another overnight in Dublin in 3 weeks and i will be staying nowhere else.",5,2016,03,25
235,"Looks run down on the outside, but nice and updated inside","When my husband and I drove up to this hotel, I was not looking forward to staying here.  It was run down and old looking outside, but I was pleasantly surprised that the room was updated and clean.  Our room had a queen sized bed as well as a single.  The bathroom had a towel warmer which was a nice feature.  Although it's located outside of Dublin's city center, it was a convenient walk to restaurants and pubs.  An easy drive to the Dublin airport the next day.",4,2016,03,22
235,Wonderful stay,"Loved our time in this well located hotel.  Good advice,good staff, good room and bed and good price.  We ate at the restaurant several times and loved the food and service. Close to bus service to the centre of town. They gave good advice on attractions",5,2016,03,21
235,lovely place to stay .,This is a lovely hotel and is very good place to stay if ever flying out of Dublin and have a early flight. It is only seven mins from airport this hotel has a bus that will pick you up near the airport they charge 5 euro per person per trip .The hotel is lovely and has a restruant it is great and nice food . The staff are very helpful. The room is lovely and plenty of room . I would stay there again .,5,2016,03,21
235,"Rude receptionist, unclean hotel","It want clean we all woke up with sore throats from the amount of dust in the rooms, bathrooms had grime around the toilet and shower, staff on reception were rude. Booking.com have a price in euros and converted it to pounds which was €397- £311 when I got to the hotel and paid I was actually chargers £327 and even though I had confirmation from booking.com with the price the hotel wouldn't honour it. Our friends had a renovated room we didn't. The shower was awful it just dribbled water.",1,2016,03,20
235,Noisy hotel,"Found this hotel very noisy, large route next to the building, windows are not sealed.. 
Clean. 
Break fast is limited for the price.  
Transport from to the hotel for 5euro
Wifi included in the price, network acceptable",3,2016,03,17
235,Stayed one night only,"We traveled as a couple in early spring 2015. We have stayed only one night. We choose it because of the airport proximity (our flight arrived late in the night).
The room was good with everything we need for one night. Service was ok also.",4,2016,03,15
235,Ok hotel,"Stayed here for two nights on business in and around Dublin.I chose this hotel as its well located for access to the city centre and handy for motorways to towns like Coolock and Lucan. If visiting Dublin city centre only I would choose something a bit nearer, but this hotel has everything needed for a short comfortable stay, good rooms,beds etc.Food on an evening in restaurant was good, breakfast is buffet style and not the best but will do if company paying. Shuttle provided to airport at 5 euro.",4,2016,03,15
235,Good value but could be cleaner ,"The room was lovely and the bed was comfortable and spacious but we discovered a large stain on the end of the bed sheets which was a little unsettling. 
Great bus shuttle service and most staff were friendly with the exception of one blonde haired receptionist who was rude and unpleasant. ",3,2016,03,14
235,Great if your about to catch a flight,"I stayed here before catching a flight. I took a bus to the airport and had their shuttle pick me up. But, because I arrived a bit later than I intended the shuttle wasn't available and they offered to pay for my cab. It did take a few phone calls to get a hold of them though when I arrived. 
The hotel is very much an airport hotel. It has food available late at night (but only a few items at late hours) and menus for local restaurants that can deliver after the kitchen closes.  They also have a full bar. The room was also really nice. Even though I was on the first floor I didn't hear any noise or traffic from the road.
However I did have a few issues. They seemed to me to have a nickle and dime type of approach. There were luggage scales that you need to pay to use, a computer station that you also had to pay to use (though you can email them your ticked and they'll print that for free). They also didn't have any toiletries that you might have forgotten. I didn't pack toothpaste so I was out of luck. They told me there was a corner store across the street, but it was 11 o'clock and I was a solo female traveler. I didn't feel safe going that far that late. 
The halls are also really poorly painted, and the elevators are controlled separately, which is a bit weird. But not really an issue. Also there was a light in the room that never turned off unless you removed your key card from the slot. It was some sort of night light, but if your light sensitive that may bother you. They also only gave me one towel which was super small, like the smallest towel an adult could possibly use. And the lack of a hand towel was a bit annoying.",4,2016,03,14
235,Shuttle to Airport,"With an early morning flight, we selected the Metro Hotel because it offers shuttle service.  We had just traveled all over Ireland for 10 days and stayed in some marvelous hotels.  At the Metro, we are back to reality with a medium quality facility in a medium state of repair.  

At reception, instead of a warm welcome you get a 5 minute speech about the regulations governing car parking.  Failure to heed the rules results in a wheel clamping with 120 Euro penalty.  After that you get another speech about the regulations covering the hotel's airport shuttle.  The afternoon shuttles were free but the morning is 5 Euros each person. Drivers were pleasant and prompt.

Cleanliness here is one tick above medium.  Wi-fi is free, and rooms have standard features. Hallway doors have automatic closers.  As guests walk into their rooms the doors slam loudly behind them, shaking the walls and floors.

Staying  5 minutes from the airport is comforting, but next time I'll stay in a more pleasant spot even if we have to take a taxi to the airport.",3,2016,03,13
235,"Great place, but...","Ok so hard choice here between a very strong 3 and a kinda weak 4. First the good parts...convenient location near the airport but also with easy bus access to the city centre. About a 30 minute bus ride with the bus stop infront of the hotel. also free and great quality internet across the whole hotel  Rooms were clean, spacious and had all the necessities.the bed was one of the most comfortable i had ever sleept on. Massive and with a very warm cover which alas was necessary. Also absolutely great friendly service from the staff. Now the bad part... The room was bloody freezing.. But that seems to be that case everywhere in Dublin as the concept of heating interior spaces seems rather alien. We tried fiddling a bit with the heater but nothing happened... We thought about calling the reception for help but... Actually it just gave us more reason to stay in bed so not so bad. Also not very impressed with the shower.  While the bathroom was very nice and clean water pressure was just above peeing strength... Also bathroom was freezing. Breakfast buffet was also a bit disappointing for the price.. Your basic English/Irish breakfast so eggs sausage and bacon was not bad but some veggies and cheese would have been welcome.. No no plastic wrapped cheddar does not count.  Over all despite my whiningthis is a good hotel and decent value for money. Had two Fantastic nights of sleep and would stay there again without difficulty",3,2016,03,07
235,Rooms Nice - Staff & food let it down,"We stayed for 2 nights here on the 12/13th Feb. The rooms we got were 109 & 110 and were absolutely lovely & clean. No complaints with the rooms at all although the beds were a little hard but really spacious. could not fault the room at all, the nicest staff were the light haired girl on reception who checked us in and upgraded us to these newly renovated rooms as I had stayed here before the other Irish lad on reception was pleasant and helpful as well, So we were on a good start to our few nights away and were happy.
The hotel is situated on an extremely busy road which at night time I found it hard to sleep, If a large vehicle was to pass outside you would fairly know about it. Ideally for the hotel to be placed so close to such a busy road should really have triple glazed windows instead of the double glazed they seemed to have. We went for breakfast the next morning and it was suppose to be ending at 10:30am, So we decided to go down for it at about 9:45am So not to miss any of the good food. To my surprise there was hardly ANY food left the choice was really really poor. No croissants, No milk, No pancakes, Very little morning juice and the waiter seemed more interested in cleaning than offering to get us anything. I ended up having a cooked omelette and some sausages with toast, The omelette seemed to have a bad taste to it maybe it was the eggs or maybe it was the cheese but whatever it was it didn't taste right at all. So I left it and  tried the sausages instead defiantly not the best quality sausage so I didn't bother with that as well and finally had to settle for just toast and cereal which I had to tip the milk container nearly upside down to get some milk, although the coffee was nice. On the 13th we decided to have dinner on the second night in the hotel as suggested by one of my party. I had ordered a burger with chips, my burger had came and it looked ok , I started with eating some chips that seemed to be reheated about 3-4 times which was way over cooked, Then I was on about my 2nd or 3rd bite of my burger and had found what looked like bone in the middle about the size of a coin, And one of my party pointed out what looked like a ring of fat around the outside of my burger, As you can imagine I immediately felt physically sick and I had to put the contents of what was in my mouth into the napkin and rushed straight to the bathroom. As for the other people that were in my party they got an undercooked fish and the vegetarian that was with us got deep fried everything which they didn't eat either. When I arrived back at the table feeling really disgusted at the quality of the food so we called the waiter over, when the waiter was told about the burger his reply was ""it's just a bone, it's just a bone"" and proceeded to stab it with a knife in front of us which made me feel even more ill than what I was already feeling. I must say I did expect at least a small apology from him but to my surprise I got nothing at all. Also that particular night we noticed that there was 3 other tables that also had complaints about their meals as well. So this was obviously not an isolated case that night. My main advice is to defiantly DO NOT eat in the hotel and seek other places to eat instead, we got a pizza delivered the first night from four star pizza which was great. And that the rest of the hotel staff (with the exception of the 2 reception staff & the 2 managers in the bar are who were all very nice) could do with being more friendly and smiling and show a bit off empathy with the customer. Because the likes of the 2 waiters and the night time reception woman who had a bit of attitude seem to be lacking customer service skills they just let the rest of the staff down and the hotel.",2,2016,03,04
235,nice place to stay,"Stayed here with my wIfe in January we were disappointed with the selection 
of food on offer did not cater much for people on low calorie diet.
The room was clean and comfortable and we were made welcome on 
arrival. Staff at the hotel were friendly and listened to our complaint re menu.Pity

About the bus shuttle changes of 5 Euro per person.",4,2016,03,03
235,"Good Hotel, quiet, very close to airport ","We have been to Metro Hotel for two night. The room was very quiet and clean. We got a welcome gift per person with some chocolate, water, body cream, soap and white slippers. The restaurant of the hotel was quite good. We ate here one night tasting calamari and pizza(not the really italian pizza but good anyway) and a baleys cheescake with ice cream. The hotel is next to bus n 13 that goes in many part of city centre.
To go back to the airport, you can walk about 20 min to the main road and take the bus n 41 or use the hotel service to airport for 5 euro per person.
Hope my review would be helpful for someone. :)",4,2016,03,01
235,"Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, excellent staff","We stayed a week in this hotel as we had to get some work done on our house. Katie in reservations was excellent we explained we needed a room with a kitchen as we have a small baby and she was able to offer us a suite which was excellent. The room was very clean, very spacious everything we needed. The staff were very professional, and helpful. The house keeping staff were very nice also making sure we had clean towels even if our room didn't need to be cleaned. Would highly reccomend this hotel.

Thanks everybody at the metro hotel.",5,2016,02,29
235,Horrible dirty place,"The carpet was all worn and teared, the room smelt bad, the area was rough, road is loud also the noise in the corridor!! Staff were not very professional, shuttle bus driver went through red lights. Only good thing is mcdonalds is a 10min walk",1,2016,02,28
235,Had a lovely stay,"I stayed at the Metro recently after a late flight into Dublin Airport. The hotel is not on the grounds of Dublin Airport but their shuttle bus is very convenient at a small affordable fee. I was very impressed with my room, it seemed to have been redone only recently, was extremely clean and had everything you would ask for and more – one of the fastest WiFi connections I’ve seen in a hotel, ever! The staff members I met were all very friendly and efficient. I will definitely stay again!",5,2016,02,24
235,AN OTHER STAY HERE,"We just love The Metro . it does everything it says ""On The Tin "" and more besides . Since our last stay in November 2015 , almost all of the rooms have been upgraded. 
The Bistro 9 has improved , and The Staff are a credit to the Manager Mark Williams. 
It is seldom to see  that all the staff seem to enjoy working there , and this is evident in their willingness to assist with a genuine smile.
This hotel offers , secure parking , friendly and attentive staff , excellent rooms, and a most reasonable price and it does not pretend to be something it is not.

it is difficult to find a balance between price and standard achievable within that price and I believe that The Metro is well worth a visit.",5,2016,02,24
235,Park and fly,"We stayed one night to park and fly in Janaury. Great service by the hotel staff all round. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Shuttle service is excellent and driver Lougi is very helpful. When we came back from holiday, we stopped to have bite in the bar. Plenty choices in the menu and it is value for money. Staff are very professional and provides great customer care to the customers. Dress code is very smart to a five star level. Our car did not start as the battery was dead. Guy from the bar and trainee young fellow  came to assistance. Both of them very helpful and the van driver Lougi came to our rescue us as we had to come back to Cork. Overall it is in a great location to the airport as it took only 10 minutes from the shuttle. Great staff, good food and value for money.",5,2016,02,22
235,Fantastic Stay,"I had a fantastic stay in the Metro Hotel, the room was spacious and staff were very helpful and friendly. I would recommend staying there. Great location as only a few minutes walk to Santry and it's extremely easy to get into the city centre as bus stop is at your doorstep. ",5,2016,02,18
235,Ok hotel for the price,"Ok so my husband and I stayed over here during a trip to Dublin for valentines. The price was really good at £60 for the night (or there about) and the hotel room seemed clean. I was pleasantly surprised by the bathroom in our room which was clean and looked like it had been refurbished, the food in the hotel restaurant was very nice also and good value.  However, the kettle in the room had water in it which I just get creeped out about, the cleaners obviously hadn't emptied it out and cleaned it after the previous guests. Also the walls are very thin and residents next door were extremely noisy to the point where at 2am we were still unable to sleep due to the noise. We called reception and to their credit they sent security to deal with the issue, however I had expected to be offered a late checkout or at least some recognition of this issue considering we had not been able to sleep until after 2am. 
The next day we checked out and the lady at reception even asked me if it was noisy and I said yes, we had to call security and didn't get to sleep until very late, yet still no discount was taken off our bill or recognition given to the disruptive night we had on what was meant to be a quiet night away. 
Due to this I don't think I would return, in other hotels where noise has been a problem I have been offered a late checkout and a room upgrade should I stay again, I know people making noise is not the hotels fault but customer service is what keeps a person returning. ",3,2016,02,17
235,Good price/location,"Good location about 20-30 minutes from the city center (by bus).
Buses run until about 23:30. The room was nice and clean.
The staf is fairly friendly although one or another element not so much (at reception).
The only drawback was the fact that we had to wait about 40 minutes for our room despite arriving at 14h (start time of check in).
Anyway I would recommend",4,2016,02,08
235,Good hotel between flights,"The staff were friendly,and the hotel was so clean.Good hotel and value for money. Hotel is a 7-minute shuttle trip from Dublin Airport and 6.4 km from central Dublin.Hotel offers free transport to the airport combined with direct bus routes to the Dublin City Centre. An ideal hotel for business travelers.",4,2016,02,08
235,"Very good service, nice rooms and good food","We stayed here from 17 - 22 Jan, and the service and staff was always there to help, If needed. Room was always left in the order we left it, but the bed and towels where changed every day. The bar staff was always greeting us when we came down, and made some very good drinks. Irish caffee was, of course something we tryed a lot. The food was over the top perfect. We asked for medium, and medium was just perfect. Will recommend the pig. If you asked the staff anything, they would show you on the map, and help you with the bus or taxi. If you wanna order food, you just ask them, and they will order it for you and bring it too the room. We really enjoyed the place, and are definitely going back there on our next trip to Dublin. ",5,2016,01,22
235,Not very impressive ,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Metro Hotel for 1 night as we had an early morning flight to catch. Unfortunately we didn't have a great experience here. 
On arrival the staff tried to tell us that we had not booked at all. She wasn't very polite and did not believe us until my boyfriend showed her our confirmation email! After this was all sorted we parked our car in the (very secure) underground parking and made our way to our room.
We were highly disappointed. The decor was dated, the room looked grubby and like it needed a deep clean. There was a door by our bed joined onto the next room and we could hear the couple quite clearly talking and watching tv. There was a large stain on the carpet and the bed was extremely uncomfortable with the springs nearly coming out through the mattress. It was 2 single beds pushed together.
However, the bathroom was clean and bright and I enjoyed a nice hot shower before bed.
All in all this is hotel seems to be in need of a good refurbishment. I would not stay here again I would happily pay an extra 10-20€ and stay in the Hilton or another airport hotel. 
The shuttle bus driver was nice and helpful and the journey was about 10 mins hotel - airport.",2,2016,01,11
235,Nice place,Karen (galway)just left after spending 2 nights there.staff nice the security day and night staff were very helpful  very clean the only complaint I have is paying for car parking as a guest .its a nice place to stay and  dry handy for the airport.,3,2016,01,10
235,Perfect hotel,Arrived at hotel to find very friendly staff. Staying one night but leaving car for 4 nights. Feel reassured car is locked in an underground car park. Got to the room to find a spotlessly clean very modern room. WiFi and wired internet connection. Very modern decor. Bathroom has big double shower. Excellent value for money!!,5,2016,01,09
235,Great staff,"The very friendly staff make this hotel. Would hate to single anyone out. receptionist ,bar staff and waiter were more than friendly and helpful. Hotel is adequate ,rooms are ok but in need of some modernising, bathrooms clean and bright and bar/restaurant is fine. We had one major issue ,we had twin beds put together for a double but as they were light they moved during the night. Should have something to keep them together if used as double. Evening dinner was very tasty but some slight improvements could be made with breakfast. Hotel is very close to airport with a shuttle service available if required. Would stay here again.",3,2016,01,06
235,Car Parking Facility,"I used the hotel for parking while I was away for a 7 day break, 12th -19th Dec 2015. The staff I mentioned were all lovely but I would call out Michael, my shuttle driver, for special mention. He was the driver on both legs of my journey and he was lovely and very chatty. He does seem to go out of his way to make the service that much better. The price at @ €28 was good value and the shuttle seems to run very regularly. The one issue I did have was that the gate can be a bit tricky to use and there are not many spaces available in the nearest car park. I will most likely use it again when I travel next.",4,2016,01,05
235,Avoid at all costs ,"Originally chose this hotel because it was near the airport and offered slightly better value for money than the other hotels in the area. Huge error. Upon entering our room it stank of smoke, as if someone had been smoking in it for weeks. Thankfully the guy at reception managed to find us another room and stuck two twin beds together. Not exactly what we're after but beggars can't be choosers. When questioning it the next day I was given a mumbled apology followed by 'you owe me €65'. Pretty poor if I'm being perfectly honest. 

Regardless of the stench of smoke, the rooms are old and battered and beds are straight out of the Victorian era. For the sake of £10, stay somewhere else. You'll regret it if you don't. ",1,2016,01,03
235,Ok stay,"Stayed for a night over New Years and it was just ok, the rooms were a little smaller than average I felt but bathrooms were pretty. What dissappointed me was breakfast , very little to choose from in the "" hot "" section & cold wasn't much ether. Staff were very nice",3,2016,01,03
235,Would not recommend this hotel,"We thought, based on the online photographs and the fact that the hotel offered an airport shuttle service, that it would be a decent option to stay at. Unfortunately the website photos are completely deceptive, perhaps deliberately so, in that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade, with carpet and bedding thread bare; this along with the fact that the windows don't close properly and rattle if there is a slight wind, tape was used to hold together the heating element for the towel rail in the bathroom, the room was not serviced until late afternoon and this was only done after we questioned why nothing had been done, and it is a 30 minute bus trip from the city centre from the hotel. To top it all off, even though we booked our shuttle to the airport the day before we needed it as advised by reception, the morning of our departure, at the time the shuttle was supposed to leave the hotel, we were told that the shuttle driver wasn't coming and that we would have to catch a taxi, this was after we had already paid for the shuttle, we were then told that a taxi would be called for us but that it would take 30 minutes to arrive and it shouldn't impact our check in time at the airport, even though this delay would mean we would be late to check in. A completely disappointing and frustrating experience. I would not recommend this hotel.",1,2016,01,02
235,Consider it a reasonable Priced Hotel near the Airport,"The room itself was adequate.  If you want to pray Hilton Prices, then stay there.  But our rooms was clean, spacious and adequate.  Serviced each day (stayed four nights and used the bus which is a short walk to catch a ride to the center of Dublin).  Breakfast was just adequate and would suggest getting food at the airport as it was better and no more expensive.  Desk folks were very helpful!",3,2015,12,22
235,Beware Room 315,"Room 315 has a mould problem. The moment you enter the room you can get the smell. I noticed patches on the wall around the room and thought nothing of it initially, but after about 10mins it struck me what it could be because I've seen this kind of thing before. Sure enough, behind the bed I found black mould. It looked like a shoddy cleanup job had been done on it perhaps a few months ago and now it was growing back. The job they did was obviously a stopgap and didn't actually fix whatever is causing it. Not a place you'd want to sleep if you had breathing problems!

Rang down to the reception and had changed rooms within ten mins. I'm sure someone in the hotel must be aware of the problem. 

As for the room, it was fine for me. I'm sure other people have said how weird it is having the kettle in the wardrobe. As for location, I can only imagine what people who would be using it as a holiday base would think. Nowhere near the city centre and not close to the airport, which is what I wanted it for.",1,2015,12,17
235,Depends what your looking for...,"Myself in a group of four were staying in this hotel on a Friday night, we had a concert to go to in the three arena. The hotel is fairly easy to get to just off the M50 but there didn't seem to be many parking spaces for the hotel. At reception there was a bucket catching water which was falling from the ceiling... After checking in we went up to our rooms, on arrival to our room we were greeted with another bucket in the hallway catching water which was falling from the ceiling... We carried on into the rooms which were ok, typical basic hotel room and no leaking ceiling!!They were clean and comfortable which i think is a minimum requirement when your staying in a hotel.

As we checked in we had asked reception to book a taxi for us, they did but ended up being late. After several attempts to get a taxi the receptionist rudely told us if we went out around the corner we could wave down a taxi from there. They obviously have a deal with a certain taxi company. My advice if you stay here, get a taxi sorted yourself unless your not under any time restraints!!
We didn't have any problems with the rest of the staff.
The next morning when leaving our rooms the leaking ceilings obviously got worse as there was towels everywhere soaking up the water.

I'm sure the whole water leak was a one off, it was very stormy that week!!

If your looking for a somewhere to stay if your going to the airport, have a concert to go to and not too bothered about accommodation then the Metro will do ok, if your looking for something a bit more special then keep looking.",2,2015,12,17
235,"Good, better BEST","Good rooms that could use some improving, better tv's and water and tea for all etc....

Better rates than anyone around, bang for your buck.

BEST service and hospitality I've ever experienced in any Dublin Hotel, the Driver, Michael from the time he picks you up makes you feel like you're returning home and Kristel at reception will assist and answer any question you may have. Service excellence!!!!!

Try it!",4,2015,12,11
235,Park & fly service ,"I picked this hotel to park and fly as had early morning flight and is close to airport and had the pleasure of the been driven to and from airport by the lovely bus drivers Michael and marchin, I found them to be professional and helpful with my bags and so chatty which made us feel so comfortable, Would highly recommend using this service ",4,2015,12,10
235,"Great staff, not vegan/vegetarian friendly","The hotel looks better in pictures than in reality, but it's an excellent price-quality-location deal. Now they are modernizing it.

I do hope the people who work there are well paid because they compensate big time in terms of attitude and help and service with the fact the the rooms look old and are a bit noisy (the irish wind).They definitely made my stay great.

The menu is not vegetarian-friendly, especially the breakfast.There are no fresh fruits and/or vegetables. Not even boiled, which I would say is a big disapointment, as it is advertised to be a ""contintental breakfast"".

Overall, I would recomend this hotel, if you don't mind the not-so-fancy-rooms (which will be brand new in 2016) and the lack of fruits/veggies.
It's great located near the airport and easy connected to the city center via bus.

Alina, Romania",4,2015,12,07
235,Disappointed,"Hotel looked much better on internet site. Needed repairs, tacky worn furnishings & little room to move. One staff member was incredibly helpful but not much service & very long wait to register. Rooms were noisy. Good bus service into town near hotel.",3,2015,11,27
235,Weekend Stay,"Chose this hotel as was not too far from Dublin airport and had an early morning flight..... was OK but rooms are a bit tired and could do with a touch of paint, also the windows did not shut properly which resulted in a cold wind blowing through and the road noise from the main road was a nightmare..... resulted in a disturbed nights stay..... on a positive note, staff were really friendly and helpful, breakfast was good, nice and hot and plenty of choice. would stay again if i had to but would like to try another hotel if returning to Dublin.",3,2015,11,23
235,Avarage at best.,"Having returned from the metro, I would describe it as average at best. The staff are good and friendly but the room was not the best. We booked a 'suite' as a treat but were disappointed to find it was spread over disjointed rooms instead of having the spacious feel we enjoy. It was clean so no complaints there. The restaurant bar area is very nice although don't expect the highest quality of meals. The area outside is not very pleasant and somewhat intimidating at night. The room we were given was by a busy road junction and was rather noisy in the morning. It would be an ok hotel for a quick overnight stop but I wouldn't recommend it for a longer stay. There is nothing around the hotel at all. In brief its an ok hotel for a stopover but not a holiday/weekend place to stay.",3,2015,11,23
235,Vegetarians and Vegans BEWARE,"So... I've stayed in many the hotel over the years and restaurant staff have always been able to accommodate my dietary requirements as a vegan. It's not that hard - I eat vegetables! 

Upon trying to order food in the hotel restaurant, the waiter disappeared to talk with the chef - arriving back a few minutes later he pointed out the vegetarian spring rolls starter and the vegetarian pasta option on the menu.

Knowing how most hotels prepare spring rolls I asked were they cooked in the same oil as fish/chicken etc and it was confirmed they were. I explained that vegetarian and vegan food cannot be cooked in he same oil as meat, fish or poultry but the waiter advised me that the chef had said it was ok. 

I also tried to enquire if there was egg in the spring rolls but again I was advised that the chef had said it was suitable.

I advised the waiter that if the chef couldn't even make advertised vegetarian food to standard that I wouldn't trust them with a vegan dish and left. 

Im posting this review because I hate to think of vegetarians being caught out and eating any food in this restaurant as its contaminated with foods that don't adhere to a strict vegetarian and certainly not a vegan diet... Despite what the chef/waiting staff may tell you.

This is the poorest service that I have received from a restaurant in years. Upon check out, I requested that the hotel manager contact me to discuss this issue, but to date no email or phone call has been received.

On an additional note, the hotel itself is very cold, there are no spare blankets provided in the room - only pillows and heating does not automatically come on. So if you don't like the cold, then I would recommend asking at reception for additional blankets prior to going to bed.

The room itself was very tired and there were stains and holes in the carpet in the bedroom. Outside of this I can report that the room itself was clean - it's only saving grace.",1,2015,11,22
235,Stay before you fly,"Have stayed here in the Metro many times and will be staying there again next week.
The rooms in the hotel are very comfortable spacious and clean, the staff have been very helpful to me.
It is ideally situated for travelling as it is just off the M50 and there is ample underground car parking facilities covered by cc tv cameras. The hotel has . park and stay offers. I found the food in the hotel good.",4,2015,11,20
235,"Unbeatable  , BUT !!","for many years we have been using Airport hotels for our overnight stay and parking before early morning flights. 
We had avoided the Metro as we thought it was just a little too far out . This year we gave it a try , and are now going to use it every time we fly out. 
Faultless , in staff, underground secure parking, an executive room ,  but in these days of hustle and bustle it was so nice to have a smile and a genuine appreciation of our custom. Yes it is not  a 5* hotel , and its not the Raddisson or similar , but it is a wonderful clean friendly and well appointed hotel, and exceptional value for money. The BUT  is that the restaurant /bar food is just ordinary . nothing wrong , but its a shame that it is not in keeping with the overall concept of the Hotel, but for us it does not detract from our enjoyment. 
Thank you Metro and hope to see you soon ,",5,2015,11,19
235,You get what you pay for....,"Stayed in The Metro last night. We booked it because of convenience to Santry Sports Clinic firstly, and then because of price. Arrived at reception to be told we had to park the car elsewhere.  Down the road and into an underground carpark. A complete nightmare to access carpark.  The hotel is clean and bar staff very friendly. Food was very basic and most foods deep fried.  Reception staff very frosty. We certainly wont be back..",2,2015,11,18
235,Great hotel for the price!,"Myself and my partner stayed here to attend a family function in a nearby hotel. Room was very spacious and bright, beds were comfortable and bathroom was satisfactory.
What made this hotel a brilliant stay for us was the staff - the staff were the friendliest and most helpful people we have come across in a long time, a special mention to Tomik the night porter who was working the night we stayed. Customer service was extremely high and is what made me give a 5* review.
Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,11,15
235,Middle of the road,"We stayed here for one night before flying out from Dublin airport. We used the shuttle and the parking, and that service was great. We got the shuttle at 5 am and there was tea and coffee available to us before we left which was nice. 
This is hotel was comfortable for one night, some aspects of the hallways and the bathroom could do with some Tlc but generally speaking the staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and a nice size. ",3,2015,11,14
235,Please don't stay here. ,Do yourself a favour and don't stay here. The rooms are gross. The carpets are worn out and they don't leave you a new roll of toilet paper. We were left with an empty roll and one full roll. We then ran out and asked the staff to bring us some. Two hours later!!!!! They finally bought us some toilet paper. Such a pain as we had to use the bathroom and we had nothing else to use. Causing serious discomfort and pain. My husband went down to the clerk TWICE to ask him to help us but still there was at least another half hour wait before we received any toilet paper. Worst customer service I have ever received. I'm very fair with my reviews and this completely shocked me at the lack of care for their customers. Please do yourself a favour and just don't stay here. ,1,2015,11,12
235,Close to airport/Don't eat here.,"I chose the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport for it's value and proximity to the airport.
I arrived around 8:30 pm. check in was easy.I spent a day travelling from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher back to Galway  to Dublin. I wanted a  decent meal .I did not have high expectations for the hotle's ""Bistro"". I could not possibly set them low enough.   The menu was not imaginative.  Service was nearly non existent. There was no host/hostess. I sat myself.  I waited 10 minutes for  someone to approach me.I had to ask for a menu. I ordered a burger ,figuring this was a safe bet. It took nearly a half hour to arrive. no one else in the ""Bistro was dining at this point. Initially the burger looked enticing it had a nice char to it.   It ended there.  It was the most severely overcooked buger i have ever had the misfortune of eating. It was gray and rubbery inside and clearly had been assassinated in a microwave.No one   ever returned to my table to  check on my meal  which i clearly would have sent back.Sadly i ate this .I am still trying to wash the taste out of my mouth.                                                           I asked at the beginning of the meal to settle the check as i was checking out early.        I waited for over 10 minute s for a check ,never received one and returned to my room. I received a call from the restaurant about an hour later when i was nearly asleep.They were unable to close my check(my room was prepaid.)could i come down to the restaurant and settle my bill.  I had to find someone who claimed to be the manager .i explained my horrible experience to him .he began to tell me that they cook burgers midwell to well here, I told him hockey pucks were a better consistency.
i then further lamented the lack of  service. He waived my check when i explained that i am  a chef and that both the food and service were deplorable.
The rooms were acceptable the remaining staff pleasant.My only other complaint was having to pay for a shuttle(5 Euros)  and the insistence to do this the night before.    I do not normally post negative reviews was this was beyond the pale for inept or lack of  service.",2,2015,11,10
235,Brilliant ,"Not one downfall about this hotel, staff are extremely helpful and welcoming especially the front desk team, staff make you feel very welcomed and are always willing to assist you in any way they can, hotel is highly maintained and rooms are extremely comfortable, I would highly recommend staying with metro great staff,facilities and hotel over all.",5,2015,11,09
235,Great staff,"Stayed here for two nights as it was close to the airport. The hotel itself is great - friendly and very helpful staff, has own restaurant, clean rooms, etc. However the area where the hotel is situated isn't that pleasant.",4,2015,11,03
235,"Nice stay, close to airport!",I stay here for one night to catch an early flight back to the States. Check in was a breeze and room was clean and well appointed. Couldn't find any fault with this property as other reviews had. Everything went smoothly. I recommended this property to my friend who was leaving a few days after me. ,5,2015,10,30
235,My almost annual stay at the Metro,"I've just used the Metro Hotel again having arrived back into Dublin Airport in the evening, for an overnight stay before continuing my journey home. As usual, I found the staff at reception helpful and friendly. At the morning of my departure, having some time to kill before heading for the train station, I was delighted when I was allowed to keep my room for an extra hour so that I could walk to near-by IKEA for a pre-Christmas visit, then add my small purchases to my luggage in the privacy of my room instead of the public hotel lobby.

I was happy to note that my room's mattress was a lot firmer than that of the bed I stayed in last year. Whether the hotel has changed all mattresses or whether I was just lucky, that's hard to say. The pillows were great, too. As always, the very bright night (security) light which casts the entire room into a ghostly green light, was thoroughly annoying when trying to go to sleep. Also, one thing I will never be able to understand is, the complete and utter lack of soundproofing from the room windows. Despite having been on the 3rd floor, the noise of traffic and even passers-by talking loudly sounded as if the windows were open (which they definitely were not). If one is used to quiet nights, this can be a problem. The bathroom was as tired looking as I've come to expect of the Metro. Importantly though, it was clean and the shower was working great.

One truly negative point I have to note is, that the shuttle bus trip back to the airport now costs a whopping 5 Euro. That's a lot of money for a ten minute trip. The same money sees me catch one leg of a return journey on the Airlink bus that runs between the airport and the city centre, which is at least a forty minute trip. Shuttle busses of the Clayton and Carlton Airport Hotels remain free of charge and run more frequently. To mention a positive, my driver was very helpful with my heavy luggage.

In summary, despite some room for improvement, I shall be back again.",4,2015,10,27
235,"Not clean, not well maintained. ","We were very disappointed with this hotel. Our first impression was the dirty Matt/rug as you entered the hotel.
Check-in was efficient and friendly.
The Decour was dingy and the bathroom was old. The soap dispenser didn't work and we had trouble with the shower.
Glad we only stayed there for one night.",2,2015,10,26
235,Complete Disaster,"Complete and Utter disaster - Ashamed that I actually recommended this place to people! Room was wrong, food was cold, payment was demanded while trying to eat even though everything was pre - authorized before arriving, no real attempts to remedy the bad service, will never use it nor recommend it again.",1,2015,10,24
235,close to the airport,"king room was comfortable & clean the carpet needs replacing. Front desk staff were very helpful and knowledgable.
the restaurant was a pleasant surprise the food quality & presntation was excellent for the prices charged. The daily special was an excellent value we ate their both nights",4,2015,10,18
235,Poor,"Stayed here for one night on business recently & wont be making that mistake again. Staff were friendly but the good point end there! Room was shabby, carpets threadbare, curtains wouldn't close fully, bathroom smelled musty & sound proofing wasn't up to scratch as I could hear traffic noise from 5:30am onwards. Breakfast was ok. Really wouldn't recommend this place. ",2,2015,10,17
235,Very convenient,"Clean room, friendly front desk staff, excellent bed.  Very convenient airport shuttle - but there is a 5 Euro fee which is not told to you on their website!  Don't like hidden charges!!!  Friendly bar staff.  Excellent rates.",4,2015,10,15
235,Irish hospitality (Not),"My experiences with Irish hotels, is the hospitality we give, the Metro Hotel had none of that, shuttle bus from Airport to Hotel stops at 11.30 ish, the reason we stay at airport hotels is convience , park stay and ride they advertise, we had to get taxi adding another 20€ on our bill, when we get to check in and ask for a drink we are told the bar closes at 11.30, when I questioned about shuttle bus and residents BAR I was asked would I like to cancell 3 Rooms I had booked, they then said that we could have cans of Heineken, they had 2 cans between 4 of us and charged €10.60 for the 2 cans, our bill was for bed only and 2 cans came to €293.60, a little bit of training would go a long way on your staff, especially as an airport hotel, some people's 1st experience to Ireland, shame on your MANAGEMENT.",3,2015,10,07
235,"Decent value, very convenient, friendly staff","Not much else to say - the staff are friendly, hotel is clean and decent, the evening meal I had was perfectly fine, and the shuttle bus to the airport was very handy. Can't fault the hotel for the price.",4,2015,10,05
235,Not great,I stayed here for 2 nights with friends. I would give it about a 2 star hotel now it is gone very old and worn looking and it has not been kept well some of the carpets in the bedrooms were very worn down the beds were very low quality the bathroom was shabby,2,2015,10,02
235,Tired but tidy,"Stayed here before an early morning flight from the airport last weekend. Very convenient. The staff, both at the front desk and the restaraunt, were friendly and efficient. My rooms decor was a little tired and worn, but the room was spotlessly clean. I slept well despite the street noise. Breakfast was good with plenty of variety.",3,2015,09,29
235,Grand,"Stayed here for one night, lovely staff, Hugh rooms, carpet could do with changing as it was worn to a thread in one section of the room, the bathroom was grand, lovely hot shower, loads of tv stations and the breakfast was basically as much as you could eat, self service. Handy car park also for four euro a day. Would def recommend for people travelling to airport. ",4,2015,09,25
235,Airport stay with 7 days parking,"We stayed in the Metro for 1 night before flyng to the Netherlands. The hotel was clean and the staff were helpful. The room was nice, and there is nice bar off the lobby. It is close to the airport, less than 15 minutes in the Shuttle Bus provided for €2 per head  by the hotel. The only downside is that it is not in a good area of Dublin and the secure car park is not attached to the hotel. You have to get your room key before parking your car and the same when you are collecting the car and the car park is a 3 minute walk from the hotel, which isn't far but can be a bit scary at night in that part of Dublin. Overall, I felt the Metro was very good value for money.",4,2015,09,25
235,Good Airport Hotel,"Metro Hotel Dublin Airport was one of the cheapest options we could find for a hotel near the airport that also offered shuttle service (additional 5 euro per person per direction).  
The hotel is pretty good - we had no complaints.  There are a few restaurants around and a Tesco down the street if you need food. There is also a restaurant and bar inside the hotel.  The parking is plenty and an additional charge.
The room was pretty spacious, with a big window, clean bathroom, good water pressure in the shower, clean and comfortable bed.
The shuttle service was reliable, convenient and fast (about 10 min to airport).
Check in was painless, good service.
Overall, good airport hotel.",4,2015,09,24
235,good experience,"v friendly and helpful staff, buffet breakfast some things not v hot but plenty of choice. booked a double room but when we arrived we were in a suite loads of room!!. just a bug bear of mine but menu items on blackboard in restaurant were spelled incorrectly eg gamon instead of gammon",4,2015,09,23
235,Really good for that early morning flight....,We have stayed at the Metro many times over the years and usually in order to get a flight at an ungodly time. On every occasion we have had a comfortable room and always a very comfortable bed. The rooms are always well serviced and clean. On a recent visit we had occasion to visit the UK for a couple of days before returning and staying overnight for a flight to Toronto. We wanted to park most of our luggage at the hotel. When we explained that to the shuttle driver he offered straight away to stow our luggage in the baggage room and no need for us to take the return shuttle. That saved us at least half an hour. The gesture was very much appreciated. The lounge/bar/restaurant are comfortable and whilst one would have to say that the menu is not inspired but it is perfectly adequate and modestly priced. Booking ahead will always get you a good overnight rate.,4,2015,09,21
235,The best hotel I've stayed so far,"Been there for quite a few times and have to say.. everything from check in, the bar, the room, the staff.. til checkout - everything was perfect. I have stayed in standard room and in suite, both great. Spacious and quiet. Everything you need. Will be back!",5,2015,09,21
235,Budget hotel with a big welcome,I had to book a hotel close to Dublin Airport at short enough notice and this was half the price others hotels within a 5km radius were asking for. No doubt its a budget hotel and could do with a make over. Also I arrived late at night and it took me a while to find it. However the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and to me this gives it a lot of kudos. The bedroom was clean and the bed was comfortable affording a good nights sleep. overall I found it good value for money.,3,2015,09,19
235,Convenient and friendly,"This was our third stay at the Metro. The suite was clean and comfortable, the food and drink at the bar downstairs were good and were fairly priced, and the staff was very helpful. When my husband deranged the satellite settings on the television with the remote, a woman came up promptly and sorted it out without making him feel like an idiot. The small kitchen in the suite is well equipped.Taxis and bus service are conveniently located, and the hotel's shuttle service is prompt and inexpensive.  A bonus was the small grocery shop across the street, which now has an amazing assortment of Eastern European food. We'll stay there again any time we are flying out of Dublin.
      
      ",5,2015,09,19
235,short trip,"very clean room spatious and light, very helpfull staff, great location, very handy to have a bar and restaurant in the hotel, saved alot of time. Easy access to and from the airport, the shuttle buss service is a plus",4,2015,09,18
235,Adequate hotel,"We've had a great trip to Ireland and it's a shame to end on this disappointing note.  The carpet in our room is threadbare, breakfast is expensive and the internet connection is unreliable.  It will do but I can't recommend it.",3,2015,09,18
235,Really bad beds,"Ok so yeah this place is cheap but by the time you pay for a taxi out to the hotel and pay your way back on their shuttle bus I can't help but wonder is this place worth it?

The bed I had was of the lowest quality, broad springs which left it lumpy and really uncomfortable.

Service in the bar / bistro left allot to be desired too.

Just stay in the Radisson or then Maldron which are both on the airport site and not 20 minutes down the road.",2,2015,09,18
235,Comfortable stay.,"Stayed in this hotel before going on holiday. Park and stay rate was reasonable. Hotel was comfortable and staff extremely helpful, from reception to bus driver! Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Car park was safe.
      
      
      
      
      
      ",4,2015,09,17
235,Adequate,"We stopped here the first and last night of our tour. There were about 50 of us. The rooms were adequate. There was definitely some wear and tear on the floor, but the bathrooms were large and clean. Both nights, the street noise was very loud, but I guess that can't be helped. Overall, it was sufficient for our needs.",3,2015,09,16
235,Very disappointing stay,"We booked this airport hotel as it had kitchen facilities which we needed as were travelling with an infant. 
We booked a 1 bedroom suite but when we checked in and went to our room it was a studio with no kitchen. So we had to return to reception and ask to change to the room we paid for. It took some time and it was already 11pm at that stage and we had a 7 month old infant. When we got to our suite it was extremely old and needed a lot of work! There were creaks in the ceilings, paint peeling off walls and stains all over the carpets and bedding. 
When I went into our kitchenette to wash and sterilise the baby bottles there was no washing up liquid, sponge, teatowel etc...nothing I needed. I rang reception to ask for washing up liquid and was told they didn't have any I could take. I complained that ""how can you have a kitchen with s sink and no liquid for guests to do dishes""?? Eventually another member of staff brought me some when she realised it was for baby bottles.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel and in future I would stay in a normal hotel room and just use sterilising tablets and the kettle.",2,2015,09,15
235,Awful - from start to finish,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel last Thursday night and used the option to leave our car in the hotel carpark for the three days that we were away.  Our experience was awful from start to finish.  We were not certain of the location of the hotel even though we know the area well and relied on GPS to get there.  It is not in Dublin Airport or even near the airport  - it is in Ballymun.  The location of the hotel is difficult to find and arriving at night we found the atmosphere intimidating.  It was not clear how we might get into the car park and followed another car through a security gate.  There are two underground carparks - one one connected directly to the hotel - together with surface parking.  Sign posting was very poor and it was not clear how to get back to the hotel once we had found a space.   Cars parked just outside the hotel main door where being clamped while we were there.

The hotel itself is very shabby and the staff have clearly given up trying a long time ago.  Our room was very poor and we passed another where the customer was arguing with the staff.  Our room was not clean, the twin beds very uncomfortable and the bathroom barely passable.  Road noise was quite loud but thankfully the area was quiet.  We had a drink in the bar where the staff freely chatted to one another in an unknown language.  The seating in the bar area was very low and soft so we just sat up at the bar.  Even the vending machines didn't work.

On our return to the airport we rang ahead and the bus was over 15 minutes later than we were told.

Quite simply this is a hotel to be avoided.  If you are a female travelling alone or tourists visiting Dublin I would strongly advise against staying here - if you are flying out of Dublin Airport then try any of the other options even at the higher cost.",1,2015,09,14
235,Short night between flights,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 hours between our flights. The shuttle was waiting for us at the airport and brought us promptly to the hotel. The room was clean with convenient power outlets. The tub had a broken shower diverter, but otherwise the room was fine.",4,2015,09,10
235,Poor to Average,"This Hotel would have been rated average if not for the beds. We had traveled through Paris, London, and Scotland on this same vacation and in none of our stays were the beds of such poor quality. One thing about traveling is that a good night's rest is imperative. This hotel need to upgrade their beds! Also, it is called Metro Hotel Dublin ""Airport"" but was rather not near the airport, more like a 20 minute shuttle ride. As most American hotels do, the shuttle transportation from the hotel to the airport was not included or complimentary. We had chosen this hotel for proximity to the airport but sacrificed being close to the city. I will say their breakfast was great and the restaurant for the breakfast was roomy, clean and quiet. The local public bus transportation was also quite handy to the locale of the hotel.",2,2015,09,10
235,Decent place near airport and buses,"Did the job of a place to stay near the airport our first night in the country. Nothing special, rooms are tiny, bathrooms Even smaller. For the price you can find a B&B closer to the city. Did not eat the breakfast so no feedback there. Not really close to anything except the bus route, local food options limited, pay to park the car out front. The staff was very friendly and helpful though.",3,2015,09,09
235,Does the job,"Found this to be the cheapest option for staying the night before an early morning flight from Dublin airport.  Hotel is fine - stayed in worse! Beds are very soft and move a lot.  Rooms have safe, coffee and tea making facilities.  Wifi is free and not bad quality.  Reception staff friendly.  Food in restaurant is reasonable but service slow.  You get 10% off food when staying in hotel which is great.  ",3,2015,09,03
235,Not the best at the airport area,"+ Airport transfer, friendly stuff, work-desk at the room, tea  and coffee in the room. 
- Not very close to the airport, bed not very comfortable and movable - wheels not fixed, WiFi only for 1 device, not very clean bath, during booking hotel charges full value prior to arrival to the hotel, not flexible with cancellation. 
To the city center you could get by bus or Taxi - ask at the reception.",3,2015,08,30
235,Do not stay here,"The only positive thing about this hotel was the comfortable bed. The wifi did not work well, the staff was not overly friendly or helpful. The shower was awful (it was impossible to set the temperature to anything in between freezing cold or scorching hot). Also there is an additional fee of 5 euro for the shuttle, a service that many other airport hotels offer free of charge. For the price we paid to stay here there are definitely better options for airport hotels.",2,2015,08,29
235,Not the best,"We arrived before check in and were able to leave our bags in reception while we went out for the day. We asked crystal as the desk how long it would take us to walk from Dublin city centre to the Guinness factory. She said 15 minutes. Well it took us nearly an hour and a half and it was torrential rain so we were drenched. This totally ruined our day. If we knew it would have taken so long we would have got a taxi. 

Our room was standard, very outdated and plain, but the bed was comfy. HOWEVER, there was wee on our toilet seat! Our bathroom obviously hadn't been cleaned and i find this absolutely disgusting! I would rate this hotel a 1/10 on hygiene!! 

The cleaner was rude and kept coming in our room even though we had a 'do not disturb' sign on our door. 
On the morning of our departure the maid came in our room at 10am and asked when we were leaving. Check out isn't until 12pm so this was very rude and annoying and we felt like they just wanted rid of us! 

I woke up many times during our 2 night stay because people were slamming doors and running up and down corridors. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything.

It took us 30 minutes to get into the centre of Dublin by bus. Had i known how far away it was from the centre i never would have booked here. We spent €60 on bus fares in 3 days!
The local area, ballymun is a rough area with horrible scenery. 

This hotel is ok if you are looking for a very cheap few days in Dublin with somewhere to just lay your head on a night. However i wouldn't stay here again if someone paid me. 

",2,2015,08,29
235,Terrible service and rooms full of stains,"We recently went to Dublin and stayed over in the Metro Hotel Dublin Airport. We arrived on the 20th August to check in. The receptionist was not friendly. I booked an executive non-smoking double room, but she checked us into a standard non-smoking room. She then charged me in full for the standard room. The room was smelling like smoke, stains on the carpet and the bed was literary skew. I went back and the manager on duty helped us to another room. This room was a little better, but the furniture is out of the 70's and it needed a paint. The manager on duty was the only friendly person in this Hotel. When I checked out, the same receptionist then wanted to charge me for the suite room I was checked in. I refuse to pay the difference. Then she said its fine I can go. After several days, I was charged on my credit card for the difference.  I will never stay there again and do not recommend it to anyone. It’s also very noisy with traffic in the morning. They should not be in business.",1,2015,08,28
235,Interesting,"Grimm location, this is not ""Dublin airport"" unless you think that during busy times 10/15 minutes in a mini bus is on the airport grounds.   
Decor needs to be updated, reception staff very nice and helpfull, bar food fair,some bar staff good others not so good.Underground Car park secure but also used as storage.
Bus driver very good and honest.
Would I stay here again not to sure     ",2,2015,08,26
235,Fantastic,"This was our 3rd time staying here and yet again, brilliant service. Managed to stay in the same suite as previouds visit which was great. Staff still as friendly as ever.

Our weekend was made that extra bit special with Federica on reception putting a bottle of wine and a birthday card from the hotel for my husband's birthday weekend. Then she gave us complimentary breakfast for the following morning.

All the little touches that make the difference.",4,2015,08,26
235,Spacious suite but NO air conditioning,"To get a hotel near the airport we had to book a suite.  Lovely and spacious with separate bathroom, kitchen/dining/lounge and bedroom with king sized bed.  Even had a wardrobe with a safe.  Really nice.  However, night time came and we became increasingly hot, so much so we could not sleep. The reception staff said the next day that we could have opened windows but we had tried that earlier and not worked out how to do that.  In the night in desperation I rang reception and asked for somebody to come and adjust the air conditioning as I could not find the switch ( it had mentioned bedrooms had these in the guest guide).  A man came with a fan, informed us it was a 3 star hotel and they did not have air conditioning.  He did check that the wall heater was off.  The fan did help a bit and he did say to send for another if needed.

The pluses were that the bed was comfortable, there was a computer in the restaurant area that was easy to use, yay!!, there is a shop just across the road and it was only 5 minutes from the bus stop.  The reception staff were really helpful and friendly.

Don't ask for a roast on a Sunday, as they advertise, though.  There wasn't one!  Even though they say their Sunday speciality is a roast.  We ordered it and was told it was pork.  When it came it was like a pork chop without the bone, mashed potatoes and mixed vegies but there was gravy.  We queried if we had the right meals.  The chef came out and said it was a pork steak cooked in the oven and that he had not done roast potatoes.  The meal was enjoyable buy NOT a roast.",3,2015,08,22
235,Decent Hotel,"We stayed here for a night catching a early morning flight out of dublin. The hotel itself is nice but i was vary of the location. Rooms are good standard and the car park is quite secured. The staff were friendly and proffessional. I would use this hotel again 
",4,2015,08,20
235,Excellent Hotel,"We have used this hotel a few times now coming in and out of dublin airport and never had any issues. The hotel is clean and tidy, decent food and secure car park. But what makes it a cut above the rest is the professional & friendly staff.  They are always courteous & eager to help and make your stay pleasant.
We have recommended this hotel to family and friends and would certainly continue to do so in the future..",5,2015,08,15
235,"Practical, No Frills Hotel Convenient to Airport","If you just need a bare-bones, clean room close to the Dublin Airport, then this is your place.  The room was comfortable, if not very dated, and the restaurant was acceptable. If you do not want your the last memory of your trip to Ireland to be lackluster, then do not stay here.",3,2015,08,10
235,Layover,"I was very happy with my stay. The shuttle bus took 11 minutes, with traffic, to get to the hotel. A small fee of €2.50 is worth it. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious but maybe needed a little updating. The restaurant was lovely and the food well priced and delicious. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again if I needed an overnight before a flight. ",4,2015,08,03
235,Slightly better than average but not great,"My family and I booked two rooms in this hotel for the night before our flight to the UK from Dublin airport. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Hotel was very clean and tidy but in need of some new decor. Very 80's style with a stale smell of cigarette smoke even though all rooms and hallways forbid smoking with a €500 fine if caught smoking. The hotel reminded me of your run-of-the-mill cheap American motel. Baths are small but you can choose to have either a shower or a bath. Bathroom was quite modern in comparison with the rest of the room, hallways and hotel. We chose not to eat in the restaurant as we thought the food was too expensive so we ordered from a chippers less than 50m away from the front door. Hotel isn't situated in the nicest of areas but for North Dublin the area isn't too bad I suppose. We got the shuttle bus from the airport to catch our flight. It costs up to €5 (depending on your stay) and runs every half hour. I would stay here again.",3,2015,08,02
235,"Very good hotel, great for a stop over.","Spent 2 nights here at short notice, excellent place to stay, staff were very professional and very welcoming, rooms perfect for the short stay over very clean, one downside the carpet could do with a freshen up, they are a bit thread worn in the room I was in could do with replacement, but that was the only downside, the staff are really friendly and it is in an excellent position for both Dublin airport and the M50 or IKEA if your on an expedition there, its only across the road. Recommend it for a short stay over or a business trip.",4,2015,08,01
235,Very good,"Every member of staff here from reception  to bar and restaurant and courtesy bus are top class. Very friendly and efficient. We got a free upgrade to a suite which was very comfortable,  the fact that the walls needed a fresh coat of paint was no concern of ours as the room was totally spotlessly clean. We have stayed here a few times before an early morning flight and will be doing so again in the near future. ",4,2015,07,30
235,could have been better,"The staff were excellent and friendly the rooms are a little older now, than when the pictures were taken so are getting a little frayed around the edges just enough to notice. The breakfast was plentiful buffet style but a bit pricey.",3,2015,07,28
235,Brilliant disabled rooms!,Stayed here for the ed sheeran concert in croke park . My partner is wheelchair bound . The disabled room was one of the suites with a kitchen ( sink fridge microwave toaster & kettle ) room was great and clean . Beds were comfy and staff were all lovely and welcoming . It's also located very close to ikea great for shopping and close to city centre without being right in it . Planning on staying again and bringing our 3 year old son !,4,2015,07,26
235,Stay here if it the cheapest airport hotel!,"This hotel is not really near the airport at all, but does have a shuttle bus. The corridors and reception are very dingy. However the room catered for all we needed- a bed before an early morning flight. If it was really the cheapest hotel I would stay again but wouldn't really recommend.",3,2015,07,26
235,Decor and overall appearance take from this hotel,"Stayed in Metro prior to our recent holiday and while it couldn't be described as luxurious it was fine. We were catching an early flight and so spent little time in the hotel however I would like to highly commend reception staff, bus drivers and security guard they were all more than helpful. Having read some previous reviews I was ultra conscious of cleanliness and agree that room was badly in need of redecoration and believe even a good industrial cleaning of wood work would brighten up the rooms which I would regard as basic but fine for the money.
on a positive note our car was safe, we were dropped and collected and slept great so basically it was fine and convenient. would I stay again? probably not as I'd just like that little bit extra in terms of ambience and atmosphere even if it's just for a night.",3,2015,07,22
235,"great hotel, next to the airport.","Excellent stay at the Metro hotel for one night, check-in was easy, and the room was very spacious. The staff all were friendly and helpful. 
There was a good secure car parking area to leave the car at,  whilst we were on holiday,  with a shuttle bus every 15 minutes to leave you to the airport.
The location of the hotel, is very easy to get to from anywhere, as it is just off a motorway.",5,2015,07,20
235,Last resort when no hotel is available,"Pictures, I found them a bit deceiving. Rooms are nothing like that. They but clumsy, not very comfortable and worst of all there is no ventilation. I was literally suffocating in there. Breakfast served was good for nothing. Overpriced and cheap quality. Only reason I stayed there as it was close to airport and available for that night. Definitely will avoid this place in future.",2,2015,07,19
235,Very handy to airport,"Our room was very spacious, consisting of separate lounge area with kitchen facilities and sofa, bedroom and bathroom with great shower ( wet room style).  We booked our car into the carpark and used their shuttle service to the airport.  We would definitely recommend this hotel for, staying overnight, if your flight is the next day.  The staff were helpful and friendly and it was a convenient and stress free journey to Dublin airport.",5,2015,07,18
235,Recommended!,"Hotel absolutely recommended for its proximity to the airport and the convenient free shuttle service, still combined with an acceptable distance from the center (the bus stop is a few steps and in 20/25 minutes you are in the center). Staff at reception very friendly. Rooms are spacious compared to the average Dublin hotel, plus they are comfortable and quite modern. Perhaps some details could be improved, such as the bathroom door slightly ruined in the final part, but precisely are details that have not affected our judgment in the least. Also excellent restaurant. Book directly from their site, I have always found lower prices and great deals.",5,2024,08,19
235,Quick passage,"I stayed at this hotel one night, after landing in Dublin around 11pm and hiring a car for our tour. The hotel is located a few kilometers from the airport and offers free parking for guests. The rooms were modern though small. Cleanliness good but not excellent. What instead did not make me crazy was the breakfast that I found not up to the level of choice for the category. However, for a quick passage is fine. Would not recommend it for a stay for more than a few days in Dublin if only for the secluded location.",3,2024,07,23
235,We had a great time. I highly recommend this hotel,"I stayed with a friend for 3 days in this hotel and I had a great time. I'll briefly list the reasons:
1. Proximity to the airport and free and very punctual shuttle service. (Best regards to the friendly driver)
2. Excellent welcome and friendly and helpful staff
3. Room cleaned every morning, spacious, with windows that open halfway for air exchange, perfect temperature and silence.
4. I tried breakfast and dinner in the hotel which I didn't mind. Average prices (€10 for breakfast if you don't get the Irish one)
5. The beauty of the hotel and the truly delightful lounge.
6. Bus stop for the center 2 minutes from the hotel with buses every 20 minutes. It was a myth: it's not far from the centre, it's easy to reach.

All this makes me say that I made an excellent choice and if I return to Dublin I will choose this hotel again.",5,2024,05,04
235,Hotel mit Manko,"Gute Lage zum Flughafen und  gute Anbindung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln in das Zentrum. Hotel sauber, Bar und Restaurant o.k.
Standartzimmer klein und noch kleineres Bad. Hauptmanko: die Betten.
Nach Rundreise durch Irland die schlechtesten Betten mit durchgelegenen Matrazen.",3,2023,07,04
235,Hotel confortable cercano a aeropuerto ,"Escogí este hotel porque todo Dublín centro estaba lleno o a precios desorbitados por la celebración de st Patrick's. Fue todo un acierto... Habitación súper confortable, parada de bus al centro en la puerta, servicio gratuito de bus desde/hacia aeropuerto, desayuno espectacular tanto por cantidad como por calidad (tienen 3 opciones, con la más económica quedas más que satisfecho, pues es buffet). Lo mejor, el personal, atento y profesional. Nombro aquellos que recuerdo, pero fueron todos encantadores: Jennifer, Simona, Rita, gracias por hacer nuestra estancia tan agradable.
El precio, al menos cuando estuvimos, no era barato. Pero Dublín se ha convertido en una ciudad muy cara, máxime en fiestas de st Patrick, y el hotel está genial.

235,BELLISSIMO !,Ottimo hotel! posizionato vicino all'aeroporto e con i mezzi pubblici si arriva direttamente in centro città. Personale gentile e disponibile . Camere ampie. pulite e fornitissime . Lo consiglio . A++++++++++++,5,2022,11,10
235,Ideal zum Absteigen vor den Heimflug ..,"Gut zu erreichen im Umfeld des Flughafens in Dublin. Shuttle Service von/nach Flughafen (Parklatz/ Bereich 16). 
Typische Businesshotel mit komfortabler Ausstattung. Bar und Restaurant stehen wartenden Fluggästen zur Verfügung. Personal ist entgegenkommend, es gibt einen Gepäckaufbewahrungsraum.
Gleich gegenüber ein Supermarkt, 10 Minuten entfernt der Park von Santry.",4,2022,10,06
235,Gutes Flughafenhotel vor einem frühen Abflug ,"Nettes Personal, sauberes Badezimmer. Die Fenster leider ziemlich undicht und sehr schmutzig, es war sehr zugig in der Nähe der Fenster. Wir hatten zwei Einzelbetten. Eines war ziemlich durchgelegen, das andere Bett war völlig ok. 
Der kostenlose Shuttle zum Flughafen hat super geklappt! ",4,2022,09,06
235,ottimale per chi deve prendere voli al mattino presto,"ho dormito l'ultima notte della mia permanenza a Dublino perchè il volo partiva alle 6,20am. Disponibile servizio navetta per aeroporto. Ristorante interno dove si mangia discretamente. Unica nota per me poco gradevole è l'aria condizionata ad una temperatura per me molto bassa tant'è che ho cenato con il giubbotto addosso",4,2022,08,24
235,Delusione totale,"Non mi era mai capitato (ed ho viaggiato moltissimo in tutto il mondo) di entrare in una camera (e parliamo di un 4 stelle a 135€ per una notte!!) e scoprire che non era mai stata ripulita dal precedente soggiorno!!! Assurdo…non c’era nemmeno la carta igienica!! Guardo nella doccia ed era pieno di capelli… non volevo crederci! Tiro su le coperte e le trovo macchiate e piene di peli!!! Incredibile… spero sia stata “solo” una dimenticanza, ma credo proprio che il fatto che sia principalmente un hotel da una notte sola abbia lasciato credere che una riordinata sommaria fosse sufficiente!! Abbiamo ovviamente richiesto un cambio di camera e questa era in condizioni migliori ma comunque non pienamente soddisfacenti. Davvero una delusione  perché la struttura in se non sarebbe neanche male, abbastanza moderno e comodo come posizione se avete un volo di mattina molto presto. Per raggiungere il centro è necessaria almeno mezz’ora di autobus ma la fermata è praticamente a due passi. Motivo per cui do comunque due stelle e non una!!!",2,2021,12,14
235,Falta de higiene y de información,"No hicieron la limpieza de la habitación. Al llegar y ver que estaba la cama sin hacer, que no habían cambiado las toallas ni repuesto el papel de WC, fuimos a recepción y nos dijeron que se tenía que reservar el servicio de limpieza  previamente, cuando nadie nos avisó de ello.  No disponían de hojas de reclamación. 
",1,2021,10,17
235,Ausgebranntes Hotel ohne Benachrichtigung,"Gebucht im März, Heute vor Ort ausgebranntes Hotel vorgefunden, schlechte Gegend, sieht von aussen alles nicht besonders aus in der Gegend, keine Benachrichtigung vom Hotel oder Booking.com bekommen. Auf eigene Kosten anderes Hotel auf die Schnelle am Flughafen gesucht. Besser, billiger und näher dran. Schlechte Info vom Anbieter Booking.com",1,2018,05,05
235,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo,"L'hotel, di recente costruzione, si trova nel quartiere Santry di Dublino, abbastanza lontano dal centro. Però poco distante, a soli 100m dall'hotel, c'è un comodissimo autobus (se non sbaglio il nr.4) che con 2,60€ ti porta fino al centro in 30min circa con corsa diretta. Il personale è davvero gentile e disponibile. Puliscono la stanza ogni singolo giorno e lasciano caffè e thè completamente gratis. La camera era piuttosto grande e il bagno pulitissimo e moderno. L'ho scelto perché come rapporto qualità prezzo è davvero buono. Lo consiglio senza alcun dubbio",5,2018,04,23
235,Sehr gutes Hotel für eine Nacht in Dublin,"Absolut sauberes, freundliches Hotel mit Pickupservices vom und zum Flughafen.
Leider an der Hauptverkehrsstraße, aber mit geschlossenen Fenstern geht es.
1/2 STS mit dem Linienbus in die City, der 50m vor der Tür hält.",5,2018,02,07
235,Gran estancia,"Durante los 15 días que me alojé, recibí un trato genial de todo el personal. 
Instalaciones buenas, y muy recomendable su restaurante. Buena carta y un servicio excelente y amable de los camareros, especialmente Mario, Lorenzo, y de Shasha.
",5,2017,11,24
235,Comodità e gentilezza,"L'hotel è vicino all'aeroporto e si può raggiungere con la navetta che parte oggi mezz'ora circa al costo di€5.collegamento WiFi gratuito.
Le stanze sono tranquille e abbastanza spaziose, con bollitore e ferro da stiro.
Il personale è davvero gentile e disponibile per eventuali problemi che si hanno viaggiando. Non ho fatto colazione.",5,2017,10,19
235,HOTEL FUNZIONALE,Hotel nei pressi dell'aereoporto (15ximinuti 15 euro di taxi) molto comodo per tornare all'aereoporto con la navetta ma anche per raggiungere il centro (30 minuti di bus 4euro) camera con letto king size ottimo materasso pulizia ok.,5,2017,09,18
235,"In ristrutturazione, ma c'è tanto da fare.","L'hotel è veramente lontano dal centro (1 ora di bus), quindi non vale la pena se si è turisti e si vuole visitare la città. Io ero a Dublino per una conferenza al DCU, e la posizione è buona (circa 2 km). L'albergo è un po' vecchiotto ma durante la mia permanenza c'erano lavori di ristrutturazione, e questo e buono. Spero anche che lavorino sulle stanze: la mia aveva un odore non proprio piacevole, e la porta del bagno si stava disintegrando. Buono il servizio navetta per l'aeroporto. Personale multilingue e gentile.",3,2017,09,08
235,perfetto se in viaggio,"Siamo arrivati col nostro volo la sera tardi e dopo 8 min. di taxi eravamo in hotel, check in super veloce. Stanze moderne e pulite. La colazione non è stata alla stessa altezza, sala un po' fatiscente, cibo scarso ma personale molto gentile (in tutto l'hotel).La mattina dopo navetta per tornare all'aeroporto a 5 euro cad., molto comoda e autista molto gentile che ci ha indicato poi il modo di raggiungere la zona di noleggio auto.",3,2017,08,30
235,Just Ok,Buon hotel per posizione. Siamo arrivati tardi alla sera e quindi abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la sua vicinanza all'aeroporto. La camera era abbastanza pulita. Niente di eccezionale ma per una notte è sufficiente.,5,2017,08,18
235,Buono,"Ci siano fermati solo una notte, siamo arrivati verso mezzanotte e siamo ripartiti presto la mattina quindi non abbiamo usufruito di particolari servizi, ma x quel poco che abbiamo visto era abbastanza pulito, con tutto il necessario presente nella camera. Niente di eccezionale, hotel piuttosto normale.",3,2017,08,15
235,"Cómodo, económico y cerca del aeropuerto","Hemos pasado unos días alojados en un viaje de negocios. El hotel es correcto y la atención es la adecuada. Está alejado del centro de la ciudad y dependerás siempre de Taxi, aunque hay que decir que el precio es muy competitivo y resulta más económico que estar en un hotel del corazón de Dublín. La zona, además, es tranquila y poco ruidosa.
El servicio wifi es gratuito y funciona a gran velocidad, algo que se agradece en los viajes de trabajo. La habitación es amplia, teniendo en cuenta el tamaño habitual de los hoteles de este tipo.
El servicio de desayuno es correcto, sin grandes alardes, y la cafetería es un espacio agradable para, por ejemplo, degustar una pinta tras una jornada en el centro de la ciudad.
Por su relación calidad-precio, no dudo en calificarlo como recomendable.",3,2017,05,31
235,Mejor de lo que esperaba,"Para ser un hotel ""relativamente"" barato,comparándolo con otros de la misma categoría,es cómodo,limpio y con un personal bastante atento.Llegamos directamente del aeropuerto,y bastante tarde para poder cenar; así que en recepción nos ofrecieron la posibilidad de pedir comida ""a domicilio"" y nos avisaron cuando llegó.Sólo estuvimos una noche,ya que al día siguiente volábamos a Belgrado y éste hotel queda muy cerca de aeropuerto.",4,2017,05,29
235,Solides Flughafenhotel,"Wir waren hier eine Nacht vor unserem Rückflug. Das liegt sehr nahe am Flughafen und bietet einen Shuttle (vom Flughafen kostenlos, zum Flughafen EUR 5 / Person). 

Wir haben hier eine angenehme Nacht vor dem Flug verbracht - nicht mehr und nicht weniger. 

Sauber, grosse Zimmer, guter Service ... Nichts auszusetzen. Ausser das der Zimmerservice nur Getränke in Verbindung mit Speisen liefert, keine Getränke ohne Speisen. Schade, aber eben auch kein Beinbruch.",4,2017,05,14
235,Bellissima esperienza,"Bellissima esperienza davvero ... viaggio molto per lavoro all'estero e quello che mi preme di più è la cucina e qui devo dire che i piatti sono molto buoni.. personale gentilissimo soprattutto Mario... 
Ciao Manuel di Ferrara ",5,2017,03,24
235,Recomendable,"Esta muy cerca del aeropuerto. Debido a que el vuelo llegó después de las 23.45 tuvimos que coger un taxI que nos cobró 15 euros (tarifa estándar). Si llegas antes de esa hora tienes el servicio de transfer.
Habitaciones grandes y muy cómodas. El desayuno lo pagamos aparte y elegimos la opción más barata, de 7.50 euros, pero como se habían acabado los pasteles nos dieron la opción de tomar cualquier tipo de producto del buffet por el mismo precio.
MUy cerca hay una parada de bus que te lleva al Centro de Dublíndole en 25 minutos por unos 3 euros.",4,2017,02,13
235,Urlaubsstart und -ende,"Günstig gelegen am Flughafen (sehr regelmäßiger Flughafenshuttle), freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal, saubere kleine Zimmer mit bequemen Betten, Klimaanlage im Südlagenzimmer am heißesten irischen Tag des Jahres leider defekt ;)",4,2017,01,01
235,Gutes Hotel im nichts,"Gutes Hotel, exzellentes Frühstück und gute Speisekarte für Lunch and Dinner, aber leider im Herzen von nichts. Einzige Ausnahme ein ALDI in 10 Minuten Fußweg. Sonst Taxi oder bei Ortskenntnissen öffentliche Busse. Zimmer sauber, gutes W- LAN und sehr freundliches Personal. Lästig sind die 5 E für den Airport-Shuttle den ähnliche Hotels in Flughafennähe ohne Zuschlag anbieten-",4,2016,09,04
235,Pessima esperienza,"Ho soggiornato al Metro Dublin Hotel Airport per una notte, e ho scelto questa struttura solo perché necessitavo di un hotel vicino all'aeroporto. Ebbene, questo è l'unico aspetto da salvare in questo hotel. La struttura è piuttosto imponente, l'ingresso è attraverso una porta automatica azionata dalla reception, quindi potrebbe capitare di dover aspettare che qualcuno venga ad aprirvi. Gli interni sono piuttosto anonimi. La stanza era piccola, decisamente poco confortevole, e necessiterebbe di una rinnovata (soprattutto il bagno). La porta di ingresso si apriva a fatica, la porta del bagno non si poteva lasciare aperta, e questo creava un ambiente molto poco piacevole (umidità e cattivi odori persistenti). Da ultimo, il ristorante, situato al piano terra dell'hotel, proponeva piatti piuttosto vari, ma di qualità piuttosto bassa. In sintesi: non ci tornerei.",2,2016,08,16
235,“Bien si se desea estar cerca del aeropuerto.”,"Es un hotel ideal si se va de paso o se desea estar cerca del aeropuerto ya que hay de 5 a 10 minutos en coche. Hasta las doce hay servicio de minibus que te lleva o te trae del aeropuerto. El hotel está bien.

Nos cobraron dos veces porque hubo un error, pero lo solucionaron rápido.",3,2016,05,28
235,Costoso,"Camera pulita, spaziosa. Bagno enorme. L'unico neo sono le 100 euro a notte e senza colazione. Il bus è a 5 minuti e il centro città dista circa 20 minuti di autobus buoni. Il biglietto a tratta è di 2,80. In ogni caso è difficile trovare un buon albergo economico a dublinp",3,2016,04,17
235,Mai più!,"Dall'aeroporto si può raggiungere l'albergo in 10min con la navetta gratuita (zone 14, parking terminal 1) e questo è l'unico punto positivo per loro. Camera sporca e moquette con macchie sospette. Insonorizzazione assente, si sentono tutte le macchine che passano. Colazione abbondante ma non compresa (11€ extra). Prezzo alto rispetto alla qualità offerta.",1,2016,03,03
235,Hotel in Flughafennähe mit Flughafenshuttle und super Küche!,"Der Shuttleservice war sehr praktisch und ging regelmäßig vom frühen morgen bis spät in die Nacht. Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich und hilfbereit. Am besten war das Essen, sowohl das typisch irische Frühstück mit Spiegeleiern und Speck und sogar einer Pfannkuchenmaschine, aber auch die reichhaltige und abwechslungsreiche Speisekarte. Der Salat war knackig frisch und das Steak nach Wunsch genau richtig gebraten. Nur die Zimmereinrichtung ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen und eine Renovierung würde gut tun.",5,2016,01,25
235,"Super Service, sehr gutes Essen","Shuttle Service funktionierte einwandfrei. Sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter in jeden Bereich des Hotels. Das Bett ausgezeichnet, sehr gut geschlafen. Angenehm überrascht war vom Bügelbrett und Bügeleisen im Zimmer. Der Haarfön  versteckte sich etwas ungewöhnlich in der Schreibtisch Schublade. Frühstück typisch irisch - Rührei/Spiegelei, Bacon, Würstchen, Bohnen immer frisch. Toll fand ich die Pfannkuchen Maschine. Frühstückskaffe hat sehr gut geschmeckt. Sehr gute Küche im Restaurant. Alles in einem - sehr zufrieden.",5,2016,01,23
235,Gutes Hotel mit Shuttle Service und guter Busanbindung zur Stadt,"Anreise: Problemlos. Nach kurzem Anruf, war das Shuttle binnen 15 Minuten da und ein gut gelaunter Fahrer brachte mich zum Hotel und gab direkt Tipps.

Hotel: Empfang, Beratung, Freundlichkeit: Top

Zimmer: altes typisches ruhiges Zimmer. Das Bad fällt leider komplett durch. Veraltete Armaturen, Haare und sauber ist anders. Schade

Restaurants: Super Dinner, nette moderate Bar.

Frühstück: typisches britisches Essen, nicht wirklich viel Auswahl, kein Käse, keine Wurst

Alles in Allem ein gutes Hotel... Man braucht ca. 25 Minuten mit dem Bus 2,10€, ein Taxi zum Temple Bar Viertel kostet 15€! 

Der Shuttle zum Flughafen funktioniert problemlos. Als Zwischenstopp super, für längeren Aufenthalt fraglich.",3,2016,01,17
235,Muy bien,"Solo por el excelente wifi ya merece las 5 estrellas. 

Por lo demás,  un hotel limpio,  la habitación amplia y baño moderno.  Los trabajadores muy amables y atentos. 

Hotel muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad",5,2016,01,01
235,One of my worst choices/Peor es difícil,"Tras media hora de espera en el aeropuerto, con un frío que pelaba, llamamos al hotel (llamada internacional) para saber que por qué.Todos los shuttles de los demás hoteles ya habían pasado 2 ó 3 veces. En el hotel no tenían la habitación que habíamos reservado y nos dieron otra. En recepción dan información ridícula y nadie nos avisó ni exactamente de cuáles autobuses pasaban cerquita ni de que el 4, en domingo, pasa cada hora!.Si preguntas a dónde ir para ver museos interesantes sólo te hablan del de la cerveza (que por cierto cuesta 20€ cada persona) y el del whiskey, pero no tienen idea de los museos espectaculares (y gratis) que tienen cuadros fantásticos desde la Edad Media (Filippo Lippi, Guercino, Piero della Francesca, Anguissola ...) hasta los días de hoy pasando por Picasso, Gainsborough y...  no digo más. En la bañera habían partes oxidadas y la alfombra de goma estaba sucia de moho. La limpieza en general no es de lo más deseable. Para no estar buscando otro hotel reservamos más días. Pregunté : ¿es preciso que baje a pagar ahora? Nooo me dijeron. Al día siguiente, volviendo de pasear, porque nosotros somos así, insistimos en pagar. Pagamos. Y una vez en la habitación nos dimos cuenta por los mensajes del banco que ya se lo habían cobrado durante el día! Así que tuvimos que volver a bajar y protestar para que nos devolvieran lo que habían cobrado de más. En el menú del bar restaurante ponía cosas que no tenían y en una ocasión, en un plato en el que, lo dice el menú, debería haber parmesano (que es un queso que se hace con leche de vaca), había ""pecorino"" (que se hace con leche de oveja y tiene un sabor completamente distinto). Si pedías aceite y sal para adobar la ensalada te servían la ensalada sin nada porque a ellos no les parecía posible (cuisine internationale!). Finalmente llegó el día de marcharse y ... sorpresa! El shuttle (un pequeño van) para ir de vuelta al aeropuerto se pagaba! Vamos que resumiendo cuentas, al precio del hotel, por estar en el quinto pino y cobrarte para llevarte de vuelta al aeropuerto, hay que añadirle10€ diarios de bus y 10 para ir al aeropuerto. Y cosa medio rara: el precio de las habitaciones cambia cada día. ...",1,2015,12,12
235,Senza pretese,"Situato a metà strada tra l'aeroporto e il centro di Dublino con la fermata dell'autobus a 200 metri. Se si vuole raggiungere il centro in taxi il costo medio si aggira intorno ai 20 euro.
Camere nella media piuttosto pulite, un pò meno gli spazi comuni che presentano macchie sulla moquette e odori forti..",3,2015,11,11
235,Ottimo servizio,"Colazione a buffet illimitata, cena abbastanza buona anche se porzioni limitate.
É possibile raggiungere l'aeroporto di Dublino in meno di 5 minuti di auto, oppure sfruttando il servizio offerto dall'Hotel.
Pulizia delle camere giornaliere con cambio di asciugamani.
Dispone di ampie sale per congressi prenotabili gratuitamente.",5,2015,09,27
235,Per una notte è ok,"Camera ok pulita e spaziosa, unica pecca il rumore, personale molto gentile e disponibile essendomi io lamentato della rumorosità hanno subito fatto di tutto per aiutarmi . Purtroppo il cambio di Camera non è avvenuto poiché l hotel era pieno, almeno così mi è stato detto.
Servizio navetta per l aeroporto a 5e comodo e veloce.
Tutto nella norma",3,2015,09,09
235,"Hotel discreto, ma con l'aeroporto non c'entra nulla","attenzione! Se pensate di selezionare questo albergo per la vicinanza con l'aeroporto, sappiate che non è affatto così. Noi lo avevamo scelto per questo motivo (il nome ci ha tratto in inganno), arrivando con l'aereo a mezzanotte ci sembrava una buona soluzione. L'hotel è discreto, ma il taxi per raggiungerlo ci impiega quasi lo stesso tempo che a raggiungere il centro, per cui non ne vale la pena.",3,2015,07,30
