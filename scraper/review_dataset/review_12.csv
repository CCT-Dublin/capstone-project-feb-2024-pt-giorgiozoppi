12,Above par than other Intercontinental properties.,"Staff were very warm. Elizabeth and Gloria at the lounge were very helpful. Facilities are very clean, housekeeping were very delightful. Rooms are big. Food was great! Don't miss the Rooftop restaurant experience too. Spa as well was great, so relaxing!

12,Excellent,The hotel is elegant and well designed. The room was spacious and the bathroom was fabulous. I loved the glass doors on the toilet and the shower. The elevators were smooth and quick and the people at the desk and in the dining room were exceptionally helpful and friendly.,5,2024,10,10
12,Highly recommended especially if you are an Intercontinental fan - excellent hotel with good club loungee,"Last time I stayed here it was a Crowne Plaza and I remember the rooms being generous in size. Now it is even better rebranded as an Intercontinental .The Club Lounge breakfast was wonderful - including eggs to order.
At check-in (in the Club Lounge) everything was as it should be - gracious, easy communication and they honoured all the IHG Ambassador benefits without fuss.

The one bed suite was very large with a corner aspect and urban views, and  fully soundproof from street including a school opposite ( suite was on level 2). It is a safe area, full of locals - not so touristy but with a lovely authentic and inexpensive restaurant/bar around the corner.

As a bonus it is close to the airport - about 20 minutes by car.",5,2024,10,06
12,Excellent hotel tucked in the neighborhood,"Excellence all around, the staff, the amenities from the moment we got out of the taxi, we were taken care of. The check in process was smooth and the room was spacious, clean, and ready early. Rooftop restaurant had great city views and efficient service. Will definitely stay again.",5,2024,10,04
12,The best hotel!,"This must be one of the finest hotels in Barcleona! The lobby and public areas are beautiful, the rooms are a fantastic size and have amazing features and fittings, they have been well thought out and perfect for travellers (many plugs and mirrors, seating and desk space). The staff were so friendly and helpful, they were knowledgeable about the area and provided prompt and personal service. The rooftop bar is an absolute must!! The cocktail bar Gebre is also fantastic, I would highly recommended this hotel",5,2024,09,09
12,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Very comfortable stay. Extremely helpful staff.
Luis at check out was of great assistance.
The restaurants and bar were very aesthetic as was the service.
Buffet breakfast had great options.
The location is good, close to restaurants and Catalan museum of art.
Close to a few metro stations as well.
Great views from the 173 rooftop terrace and bar.",5,2024,09,08
12,The excitment of a foreign city with the comfort and familiarity of home.,"When visiting a foreign country, a large part of the experience is exploring new sights, scents, culture and food - and Barcelona delivered all of this! But there's something undeniably soothing about returning 'home' each day to a familiar and inviting haven. That's how I felt about staying at the Intercontinental Barcelona. All the excitment of this urban gem, with the comfort and security of a first class hotel. Lovely property in a gorgeous neighborhood close to shopping and metro; superb service;  comfortable spacious room; top notch amenities, and yes - someone who speaks my language to help me navigate and plan activities. And not to forget the rooftop brasserie and extravagant breakfasts! Loved it all!",5,2024,09,02
12,Taittinger champagne 11am-10pm at club lounge!,"This is more like a 4 star hotel. It gets a 5 as staff are all very nice. Breakfast spread is not a lot but of good quality. I especially like the spread of bread and pastries. The club lounge is quite a dismal as the food attracts quite a fair bit of flies and variety is not fantastic. What is great about the lounge is Taittinger champagne is offered from 11am-10pm! No one really mends the club lounge, more like help yourself to whatever cocktail you can make and drinks you can find. The gym is 24hrs, spacious but the machine tries to be too clever which you can't put your iPad or anything on it while working out at the treadmill or cycling. Swimming pool has to be build LONGER? The pool at -1 level spa only opens at 12pm is so warm you can't swim more than 10 laps easily. 7th floor swimming pool is very small too and filled with people constantly. 
Location is great as we are meant to catch the soccer match and is just 1.1km walk over. Hop on and hop off bus is about 300m away. 

We had the junior suite, though room is not very big but has good enough partition to allow one person to be up earlier without disturbing the other. The shower area is rather frustrating as the Grohe tap is not easy to turn when your hands are filled with soap. All hotels please please please just use simple Grohe tap and not try to be clever. For the price we paid, we're please with the overall service of this hotel.",5,2024,09,02
12,Wonderful friendly service,"We stayed in a balcony suite. About 15 minutes from airport with check in at the club lounge on the atrium floor. The room was very comfortable and well equipped. The hotel is close to the Magic Fountain (although dry during our stay due to drought) Art museum and Olympic park. The rooftop pool gives lovely views over Barcelona with a great bar menu and great rooftop restaurant that has a grill. Service in the club lounge was fantastic, greeted by name every morning.",5,2024,09,01
12,Negative  Barcelona tourist experience turned positive by amazing hotel staff!,"We had an unpleasant outcome with the tour buses. We had paid for the hop on hop off bus but we lost the receipt when getting off the bus. We explained to the next bus driver that we had bank payment evidence and asked to continue the tour but they refused us entry and asked to pay for a fresh €60 ticket. When we got back to the hotel we explained everything to Federico and as soon as heard the story he fought hard for us to get new tickets free of charge. This was excellent customer obsession and a real testament for the quality of service. No guest should be made to pay twice when they clearly have evidence of the first payment. Thank you Federico, we’ll be back for sure!",5,2024,08,31
12,form Barcelona with Love ! 10/10 Hotel & Staff,"Stayed here at the end of August and our stay was faultless.

We arrived just before 11am to which we had an efficient check in process, and to our surprise, we were handed our key cards as our room was ready.

Upon first impressions we were impressed of the standard and cleanliness of the room and the hotel overall. The room was bright, modern, clean and spacious. The bathroom was lovely with good water pressure for a nice shower and the heated floor was impressive.

The WiFi network was strong and we did not experience any issues of this, the Gym was also very nice and of course, the pool in the top floor from the building its just amazing. After sunny day in Barcelona, just the oportunity to relax at the pool makes your day just fantastic.

We would definitely return in November and highly recommend this property. Thank you Anna !

Best Regards from Vienna,
Antonio R.

12,Marvellous Experience,"We stayed at Intercontinental Barcelona on two separate occasions this August and can highly recommend this hotel to all fellow travellers. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The staff is helpful, attentive and really cares! The hotel is very quite and rooms facing the garden guarantee for no street noise!",5,2024,08,27
12,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for one night before going on a cruise.  Check in was good and staff   The room was very good.  There is a rooftop pool and bar which was lovely on a hot evening.  We ate dinner at a Tapas bar very nearby but the hotel is a good 20-30 minute walk to the main tourist area, which didn’t bother us as we have been to Barcelona before.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of choices.",5,2024,08,25
12,"Unforgettable, Warm and Welcome....I love it","What an amazing hotel. As of the moment you check in you have the feeling that you are appriciated and welcome. They do everythin and I mean everything to make this stay unforgettable. I would like to personally thank Marie, Joan and Sandra for your care and willingness and go the extra mile to make this stay even more special......again a BIG THANK!!",5,2024,08,14
12,Poor service . Never expected this from Intercontinental,"This is a five star hotel in Barcelona .
The hotel is good, but the service standards are very poor and management needs a serious look into this. A simple request for water will take min 25-30 minutes. The one service number will either not be answered or they will transfer somewhere which is not answered or hangup.
Location is so-so.  Room size is decent unlike tiny rooms in Europe. Most of the front office staff are trainees wil deal with you casually.
Serious complaint made to a permanent staff (shower in room good changed after 4 complaints) made them send a small box of chocolate with a printed paper showing their commitment to customer service.
Anyway don't go if you are expecting anything comparable to other intercontinental hotels.",3,2024,08,13
12,Lovely hotel in rough part of city,"We stayed at this property prior to a cruise. The hotel is well appointed, staffed with professionals, however- it is not located in a good part of the city. 
It is not safe to walk in the vicinity, and there are poor dining choices in the area. 
You can expect to take a $15-25 taxi ride to get anywhere safe to walk/explore.
The inconvenience really should bring the nightly cost down- we paid nearly $700 per night for a club level room. 
This property would be a gem if it were located in a better area of Barcelona.",4,2024,08,04
12,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel, room was comfortable and so were the beds. The concierge was so helpful with many requests. All there recommendations were winners and made us reservations. The bar in the evening was very enjoyable. It’s a must stay and will return.",5,2024,08,02
12,Superb mini break.,"Great second stay at InterContinental Barcelona. We were warmly greeted upon arrival. The lobby is beautiful with a gorgeous eye catching display of flowers.
Checked in at the reception desk but as I have annual lounge membership the staff whisked us to the Club InterContinental lounge where we enjoyed two glasses of Veuve Clicquot champagne whilst being checked in. Wonderful check in experience staff were so friendly the check in process was quick and efficient, we were made to feel so special.

Excellent room was upgraded to a higher floor King classic with City view. Tastefully decorated, spacious and well equipped. Comfortable bed, with linen that was so dreamy with high quality duvet and pillows. Great clean bathroom included a walk in shower and bath, toiletries were by Byredo. The air conditioning worked perfectly.

One of the best Club InterContinental
Lounges this lounge adds an extra touch of luxury offering complimentary beverages and food. Service in the Club lounge was very attentive and friendly.

We used the Spa in the hotel the facilities were outstanding and everything was so clean. The staff were exceptional, very friendly and helpful, a perfect way to relax a blissful experience. 

173 Rooftop Terrace is great, offers a stunning views you are able to see the whole of Barcelona. We enjoyed our drinks and food at rooftop bar, excellent service and atmosphere. The rooftop swimming pool is a massive bonus a lovely refreshing pool and lounging area. We were really content spending time by the pool but you have to be quick for the lounger’s, the only slight let down was the pool area is rather small and we couldn't get any sun lounges both times we popped up for a swim. A few more sun loungers or bean bags would benefit. There was 2 exclusive areas which I believe the hotel sells experiences for a premium day at the pool with a balinese bed, but during our stay these areas were left empty frustratingly we had to sunbathe on the wooden pool surround. Must mention it’s perfect for sunbathing on the roof as a it’s a sun trap on the roof.

Breakfast at Arrel Restaurant was below average. The coffee service throughout breakfast was slow, it took a few attempts to get a second coffee also no orange juice refills offered. I requested a very well cooked omelette but I was not pleased when the omelette made to order was served floating in raw egg liquid on the plate, never seen such a shockingly bad omelette. I complained to the waiter and he said he would send another well cooked omelette out, to which when my second omelette arrived cutting into it raw egg oozed out under cooked again. Probably the worst two omelette’s that I ever had.
This experience ruined my breakfast.",5,2024,08,02
12,Wonderful hotel with exceptional staff,"We stayed at the IC Barcelona for 4 nights to celebrate a birthday. We had booked transport from the airport, flowers in the room and a private city tour through the concierges and guest services (Gema, Juan, Marc, Anna). Everything was arranged beautifully. We had dinner at Quirat which was excellent (again) and the Montjuic rooftop restaurant (excellent food, service and view) and lunch at the rooftop restaurant (who had prepared a little birthday cake so thank you!). We also want to thank the GM for his personal commitment to making our stay memorable. All staff were truly exceptional and committed to make our stay memorable.",5,2024,07,29
12,Second time as amazing as our first!,"Our second stay at this wonderful hotel.
We stayed for only one night last month before a cruise and again we were wowed by the lovely hotel and excellent service.
They greeted us and treated us so well as Diamond Ambassadors. We had a lovely room upgrade and other nice treats.
The club lounge was great again, we enjoyed some tasty food and very nice drinks.
The roof top bar, which we loved last time was still excellent!
We hope to visit again soon and thoroughly recommend this hotel. Big thanks to the team of this great hotel.",5,2024,07,28
12,What a lovely place!,"I was lucky to utilize my confirmable suite upgrade certificates and grabbed a one-bedroom balcony suite with lounge access. This was the best thing I could have ever got! The suite was huge with a lovely balcony and the lounge was excellent. The staff were such nice people, especially Leslie at the front desk who was awesome. 
The breakfast in the restaurant had a lot of items. The lounge also had a very good display of food. 
There were some clumsy issues that I would like to ignore but for the sake of perfection, I will mention it here.
 The staff who checked me in did not have a clear idea of the conformable suite upgrades and was not sure if I could get club lounge access. I had to make him understand the whole issue which is not the ideal thing to do. 
Then the welcome amenity was placed in my room with a welcome note literally on the last night of my 5-night stay! This is indeed a big flaw that no one tried to overcome in any way. 
Before my arrival, I had called the hotel and I was told I could choose to have breakfast either in the lounge or in the restaurant. However, the staff was not kept on that and then I had to finally let him give it to me as part of my welcome amenity and not as part of the club lounge benefit. 
I required a travel plug which was provided grudgingly by the staff. 
Nevertheless, it was a lovely staff and I would not hesitate to return to this same place and hopefully, these issues should be rectified and addressed to by the managed.",5,2024,07,27
12,A magical stay for business or pleasure,"Concierge Marc was outstanding.  Every night during my visit he provided individual suggestions to my stay in the city.

When I indicated I wanted a unique dining experience for my last night at the hotel, Marc recommended the Botafumeiro and immediately secured reservations.  Marc said the seafood was the best in the city and he was right!

Also the rooftop restaurant view from the hotel was magical.  As the sun sets the light dances around you and you feel captured by the ambiance of fine dining.  I had the octopus- a specially in the region.

I should also mention the breakfast buffet from the lobby restaurant is exquisite.  There were options for both continental and hot breakfast to include salmon, rice, breads, cheeses, and honey.  At $35 e it was pricy but well worth the experience.

The staff was courtesy and helpful throughout my stay.",5,2024,07,26
12,One of the best ICs,"One of the best IC’s I have visited. The hotel
Itself was clean, modern and just so relaxing. The staff, attentive, helpful and so nice! Room was spacious with view of the castle and being so close to Montjieu was lovely.

Spa was absolutely awesome and so relaxing, we lost 2.5hrs without even knowing.

From the communication before check in to the service checking out I cannot say more than a massive thank you to the hotel for a wonderful stay!",5,2024,07,23
12,Great hotel for team meeting.,"Had a great stay with the team at this hotel. Fantastic roof top bar, with great staff helping all the time. 

The old fashioned needs some practice but was getting better as the night wore on.

Breakfast was plentiful and the omelette was worth waiting for.",5,2024,07,22
12,Barcelona city visit,"What an excellent experience and wonderful hotel. Thank you all at thrbIHG Barcelona for your kind attention to our visit following a Mediterranean cruise. 
Fantastic rooftop poll and bar and wonderful staff from the front desk ,room service ,concierge and bar. Rooms are really comfortable and decorated to a very high standard .",5,2024,07,14
12,Phenomenol,"Bed is so comfy and room is very large and decorated lovely. 

But I do have to say, besides the beautiful hotel and rooftop bar, the staff on the rooftop terrace were incredible. Very attentive and accommodating to me and my partner who traveled here for the week. Would happily come back and stay here again.",5,2024,07,12
12,Luxurious hospitality,"I was visiting this hotel to meet General Manager. I was impressed with the level of hospitality. Even during our small meeting they gave me a very nice tour to the rooftop, hotel gardens and club area. 
I really loved the experience. 
This is a truly modern luxurious hotel.",5,2024,07,11
12,Lovely 5 stars hotel in Barcelona,"I was there during the F1 Grand Prix of Barcelona and selected this hotel for an event. First of all, the staff and event management team was very professional, ensuring everything was perfect for our guests—lovely rooms, very spacious and lots of amenities. The perk of the hotel is a rooftop with a 360-degree view of the city.
Definitely, a good hotel for your next trip to this beautiful city.",5,2024,07,10
12,Nice friendly hotel away from center.,"We enjoyed our stay. Appreciated to be located slightly away from the busier area of Barcelona. During our stay, Sonar event was happening at the Fiera close by but it did not have any negative impact on our stay. Staff is very friendly starting with the bellman Kamel who greeted us on our first day. Merci Kamel pour votre accueille. We were checked-in by a young lady in training, showing great potential in the hospitality industry. Hotel room was of a great size and very confortable. The terrace on the roof was relaxing and inviting. Housekeeping was helpful and friendly. I would recommend the Intercontinental without any hesitation.",4,2024,07,06
12,Cozy But Spacious & Great Staff!,"We stayed here for two nights during our two-country, three-city trip, and the Intercontinental was hands down the best hotel. It was comfortable, cozy yet spacious, quiet, upscale, and welcoming. The rooftop view was beautiful, and the staff was very helpful with hailing taxis and providing directions on where to find various items we sought to purchase. I definitely recommend staying here on your visit.",5,2024,07,05
12,Incredible hotel experience,"Incredible hotel experience
The hotel is obviously beautiful but the staff is really what makes it special. Their attention to detail is unmatched. 
AURA and LUIS at the front desk were both incredible souls. Every staff member we encountered seemed to take so much pride in their work and truly seemed to love their jobs and that says a lot. I can’t think of a single negative thing to say. I should also mention the breakfast was fabulous. 
We will definitely be back!!!",5,2024,07,03
12,Great international brand out of town,"Great hotel, comfy beds and friendly staff. Lounge access was great value. Thoroughly enjoyed the roof top DJ on Sat evening as the sun went down. 

Negative points are very small roof top area for hotel this size, it was also closed for a private event one evening which was a shame. Lots of events at hotel so can be busy with delegates. No upgrade available as a platinum member as conference on. 

Likelihood of getting in the pool very low. 

Great tapas restaurants over the road, Casa du tapas was the best. Area very Spanish as it's out of town. 

If I didn't stay here I would have booked Hotel 1898 as better location and can usually find a seat on the roof.",5,2024,07,02
12,Excellent,"Our stay was amazing and everything was organized especially the concierge team were so helpful thanks all
We will see you soon 
Highly Recommendedddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd",5,2024,07,02
12,Best Stay At An Intercontinental,"Stayed two nights after a cruise. We are Ambassador and they really took care of us. We got off the ship at 6am. The hotel allowed us to check in before 7am. No questions asked. Simply unbelievable. The level of professionalism and class in this hotel is unmatched. They gave us a great room. Hotel is just stunning. This is coming from someone who sees a lot of hotels. They gave us complimentary access to the thermal suite at the spa. Ironically, both days in Barcelona rained. Spa access was a wonderful gift. Ate 3x at the restaurants. All were spectacular. We are from the USA. Planning a return trip already.",5,2024,06,28
12,Muchas gracias,"All of the staff was friendly but a special thank you to Gema y Kamel. Very friendly, welcoming and helpful with a big smile. Will definitely come back. 

Muchas gracias Gema y Kamel! Please come visit.

12,Pretty decent,Lovely hotel but disappointed in bathroom. It needs the grout cleaned it was black in places.  Very close to the National Art Museum.  Good rooftop terrace/ bar. Comfy beds and pillows. Stunning reception / bar area.  Personally not my preferred area of Barcelona.,4,2024,06,27
12,Good hotel for Montjuic area,"Nice hotel - very spacious rooms, friendly staff, comfy beds, great views of Montjuic.  Breakfast buffet is expensive (35 euro per person) but with a ton of choices.  You could easily have a huge breakfast with cook to order omelets included and skip lunch.  Two issues....one if you are on the 6th floor prepare to hear the staff dragging tables and chairs on the 7th floor pool level after midnight and second - the area around the hotel is just ok.  Montjuic is a 15 minute walk which is why we stayed there, but it's a bit further away from La Rambla, Gracia and the Gothic quarter.  Poble Sec metro stop is less than a 10 minute walk.",4,2024,06,23
12,Best hotel we ever stayed,"One of the best hotel we ever stayed at.  More than the hotel it’s self good location and great rooms the best was the team at this hotel the people working were all very dedicated helpful ready to do what ever is necessary to
Make stay the very best.  We enjoyed three days at this wonderful hotel especially the lounge, roof top bar and the Spa all are excellent.  Rooms were also very very good.  Location of this hotel is very convenient and very easy to get a taxi .  Three days is not enough to visit Barcelona.",5,2024,06,20
12,Modern Excellent Hotel,"Amazing hotel, has a Michelin restaurant in hotel, great gym, great concierge, large very modern rooms, fantastic breakfast buffet, and in a superb location right near the modern art museum and the buildings from the 1929 Worlds Fair. Highly recommend",5,2024,06,11
12,Juan Silve - Going the Extra Mile!,"Juan Silve at the front desk was the absolute best!  My son just finished Spanish Immersion Elementary and wanted to practice his Spanish. Juan went out of his way and spent 45 minutes with my son patiently speaking Spanish. It really made my son’s night and was the highlight of our trip. A heartfelt thank you to Juan for going the going the extra mile to make the trip of a 12 year old complete. 

Thank you and keep up the great work!!",5,2024,06,10

12,Beautiful hotel and great staff,"We are presently staying at the intercontinental Barcelona.     I was greeted first class by the front desk. I am a diamond /ambassador member and was greeted like so.
Sonya at the front desk was extremely friendly and guided me through what the hotel has to offer and what I can get with my benefits.  We were upgraded with a higher floor room.  Room was very nice and spacious .
We went up to the roof top to check it out and wow what a view.  You can see quite a bit including familia Sagrada.     We decided to have some food and drinks. .   The staff were very friendly , especially our waiter ( forgot his name ).   Food was great and so was the wine .  
There is a nice lounge area with a pool up there as well.    I’ll be going back up tonight to enjoy a drink and a cigar .
We just had breakfast and again staff was fantastic.  But there is a very very nice selection of food .   
As a wonderful touch and I want to thank management .  We were sent up last night a bottle of champagne and some nice chocolate strawberries for our anniversary 
Wow what a beautiful touch and they made me look like a hero with  my wife .
Thank you ,  we look forward to the next 3 days here",5,2024,05,24
12,"Nice property, ok service","Nice property, food is ok but not great, staff is very kind but kind is not the only thing that is needed for good customer service, I was there to celebrate my Birthday, I emailed the hotel ahead of time with no response, then at checkin they helped me to make a reservation at one of the restaurants, the day after I decided to confirm the reservation and they told me: I’m sorry, I forgot we close the restaurant on Mondays… if I hadn’t asked I would’ve ended up with no plans… but every minor thing that they don’t get right they end un making it right.",4,2024,05,20
12,"DO NOT go there, tourist trap!","If you want to sleep on the basement for 500 Eur per night you need to choose this hotel. When we arrived in the middle of the night, tired from long trip we received the room where the window was block ""due to security reason was written"" and you actually see the shoes of the people walking on the sidewalk"" because the room was in the basement, everyone can see your room from sidewalk. After 5 minutes we booked Nobu hotel suite which is close by and definitely better choice. The first night in the Intercontinental was charged as a cancelation fee. They had rooms available online but they do not offer anything else even paid upgrade. If you would like to stay in refurbished old hotel with ZERO customer experience you should choose Intercontinental. If you would like to choose 5* hotel where room does not look like basement you should go to NOBU. Also the rooms in Intercontinental does not look good and expensive, cheap materials, cheap linen, small rooms, everywhere fake calacata tiles - it looks like cheap 3* hotel in Bangkok. Check the tripadvisor reviews before go to this basement.",1,2024,05,19
12,UNSAFE HOTEL + COCKROACHES,"I stayed here during August 2023 and it was very unpleasant. Whilst the hotel looks beautiful and the rooms are spacious, the service is terrible and the hygiene also. 

I had 3 major issues during my stay. The first issue was that the staff have no sense of boundary. My wife was in the room changing and a staff member used their key card to unlock the door and walked straight into the room and when she saw my wife there, she ran back out. There was no knock, or anything. This really played on my wife’s anxiety as she no longer felt safe and secure there if anyone can walk in. We don’t know if she came in to steal something or what but she never returned after that. I immediately reported this to the hotel manager when I got back that day. This was totally unacceptable. 

The second issue was that the hygiene was very poor. The first room we checked into, the shower was dirty and still had remains of hair which I had taken a photo of. 

The last issue we had was that we had found 2 cockroaches in our room. This again was totally unacceptable. I immediately told the reception and we wanted to move room again due to uncleanliness. I have attached a photo of this also.

I spoke with the manager who only apologised and offered free entry to the SPA for the two of us and mentioned that she would add 40,000 complimentary points to my IHG ONE Rewards account. 

Upon reviewing this now, she never added the points and does not remember saying this.

I would never return back to this hotel due to the lack of safety from staff and cockroaches found in the rooms.",1,2024,05,16
12,Deliver the impossible and exceeded all expectations.,"Excellent again and this is the second year I am returning to this wonderful hotel.  The concierge at the lounge , Gloria, made a big difference and helped us on impossible task. 
Very pleasant, cheerful and helpful . What more can I one ask for . We’ll come back for sure.

Close to 2 main museums and the restaurant is good.  Spa is also fantastic . 

Just magnificent!",5,2024,05,03
12,5 star hotel and top notch service,"Beautiful hotel, delicious breakfast, great view from the roof top. Food is top notch, cozy club lounge and the teams at reception and club lounge are amazing, especially Ms. Elizabeth the club lounge manager, she made our stay, and will definitely be back! Thank you, Eliza, for your professionalism, patience and kindness, you are a star.",5,2024,04,28
12,Will come back,"Everything was great. Room was clean, everyone was kind and they had great breakfast. The hotel has a great rooftop and I highly recommend to visit there while you stay. It’s close to everywhere. I would def. come back for my next barcelona trip.",5,2024,04,05
12,"Without them, this hotel might be the worst intercontinental experience","The location of the Barcelona Intercontinental is rather awkward, situated outside the city center. Returning to the hotel from the nearby shopping mall at night poses safety concerns, necessitating the use of a taxi. On one occasion, a taxi driver became agitated upon realizing how little she earned from our trip, even insisting that we pay the minimum charge of 7 euros instead of the meter charge 4 euros. Despite her proficient English, I asked the doorman to clarify the driver's request, which she eventually withdrew. However, another guest waiting at the hotel's entrance was less fortunate as no taxi was available.

During check-in, the front desk staff neglected to inquire whether we preferred a twin or double bed, assigning us a double bed room at the end of the corridor instead. Despite this oversight, Sergi, went above and beyond to assist us. He demonstrated exceptional helpfulness and patience, repeatedly moving heavy luggage to ensure our satisfaction. Additionally, he offered us an umbrella without us even realizing it was raining outside.  Kamel's warm hospitality made us feel at home, while concierge members Gema and Mara provided valuable information. Gema even remembered to return a forgotten power bank upon our departure.  Yet not all concierge staff were equally competent. One member failed to check thoroughly whether the museum was indeed located in the nearby city, resulting in unnecessary expenses of around 100 euros for train and taxi fares to nowhere. My sister had followed his advice to visit the church first, leading to disappointment and frustration.

Furthermore, the hotel's instant service operators failed to fulfill their duties promptly. Despite assuring us that they would clear the mini-bar, it took until the third request for them to do so. Upon completion, the staff member left our room with a displeased expression. Later on the same evening, we were surprised to find two glasses and bottles of water placed on our bedside table when we returned to the room after speaking with the concierge. This was not provided to us on our first day, and even if it is standard practice, such services should ideally be completed before 6 p.m. It is concerning when staff enter our room while we are inside, and it poses a possible safety issue when we are out, as no staff should enter the room without our permission.   When I raised these issues with the duty manager who simply dismissed them as mere comments without providing any explanation.  However, Anna from guest services showed a more proactive approach by addressing my concerns and providing at least some explanations which although I still could not be convinced.

Such service discrepancies continued, with the morning wake-up call scheduled for 6:45 a.m. not being executed until 6:53 a.m.  It would matter as we have to hurry to catch the train schedule.   Frankly speaking, without the aforementioned staff, this hotel would be the worst Intercontinental experience I've had.",2,2024,04,04
12,Breakfast charge is absurd.,The hotel is very nice.  My only regret is that the neighborhood does not have ANY restaurants nearby making the hotel your only choice.  Breakfast is a whopping 75 euro per person plus VAT.  After paying up for the hotel room this is a slap in the face.,4,2024,04,02
12,Super,It was incredible. I didn’t know how was Barcelone in march but I needed to see the city without all the tourists of summer. The hotel have an important place to procure my joy and satisfaction of this little vacation. Thanks to the staff and particularly Senora Sarah Gbochos.,5,2024,03,30
12,"Good experience, top concierge service.","Good experience, top concierge service, the food and cocktails are delicious, a warm atmosphere. Having come as a tourist, the hotel staff advised me of good places to discover in addition to their excellent. Really looking forward to going back and why not with the same staff.",5,2024,03,29
12,One of the best holidays in Spain,"While I was on a trip with my dear colleagues we decided to stay in this hotel and didn't miss with the decision. All of us had only
positive feelings about the stay and the service. Greatly appreciate your friendliness of staff and your quality of service provided!",5,2024,03,29
12,Beautiful trip to Barcelona,"As far as it seems my trip went brilliantly. The staff was great and hotel room was in excellent condition. Apart from that I want to give some praise to the food that is being cooked there, astounding.
Just an overall great feeling about my journey to Barcelona and of course InterContinental BC!",5,2024,03,29
12,Amazing Customer Service  Excellent Hotel Facilities  Great Location,"From the moment you arrive until you leave you just keep experiencing the most outstanding level of professional customer service and every member of staff goes that extra mile to make your stay so pleasurable.
Our booking included Club Lounge access very warm greeting from Elizabeth the manager who very kindly upgraded us to a one bedroom suite with balcony which was very well furnished  and a nice surprise being our 60th wedding anniversary .
The lounge has excellent choice at breakfast which was serviced by Pula and Carmen very friendly and attentive always a grate pleasure seeing them also Luis who serviced the lounge for afternoon teas and evening canopies  and drinks he was very friendly and kind.
Just can't wait to return this hotel excels  at every level it's amazing",5,2024,03,27
12,Excellent choice for Barcelona visit,"The Intercontinental Barcelona is a wonderful hotel for a stay in the city.  The lobby, bar, restaurant - all public areas are beautifully decorated and comfortable.  The rooms are a very nice size with new, modern bathrooms. 
The staff is exceptional from bell staff, reception, concierge, restaurant to housekeeping.  Everyone tries to accommodate and provide excellent service.  We have stayed at other 5* properties and this is by far the best!",5,2024,03,26
12,Fabulous,Fabulous stay. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Only issue is the hairdryer is terrible. The cord is too short and the outlet is high on the wall. Not practical at all. The concierge was so helpful with dinner reservations and booking admission tickets. Would definitely stay again.,5,2024,03,23
12,Wonderful stay in this amazing city,"My husband & I went for a joint birthday celebration & to explore Barcelona.
We arrived early for check in (about 11am) - the checkin staff were very friendly & accommodating & we received complimentary drinks with our stay, as IHG members. Lovely room on 5th floor which had recently been refurbished - amazing bathroom with separate shower & bath & a seating area in the room. The doorman Elber was brilliant from the moment we arrived - he arranged fresh milk for my English tea & made a point of speaking to us whenever we were coming & going from the hotel - a great ambassador for the hotel.
Our only negative comment would be about the bar staff - we sat at the bar on each of the 3 nights we were there & found the bar staff polite, but really lacking in conversation (& the bar was not busy - perhaps that’s why??!!)
Compared to the other staff members, their service was cold & unwelcoming.",5,2024,03,23
12,Fantastic experience ! Must for Barcelona tour,"Fantastic experience !! 

Not only rooms are cozy , staff is courteous , breakfast is huge and covers entire territory of Barcelona , they are humble , gentle , kind hearted and also accomodating ,

I had lost baggage during air transit at Switzerland , which staff were courteous enough to track down and deliver at our rooms which was beyond their duty hours 

Small requests whichever they are being very politely managed and accomodating.

Not only food is out of place but it has world cuisine made at such palatable style that we it delivers a unique note to all senses !

Barcelona tour is incomplete without stay at intercontinental to see how special culture and people are with their attention to details",5,2024,03,22
12,A relaxing place to stay,"We loved staying in this hotel. It seems to be busy more with corporate guests than travellers for leisure like us, but facilities are great for tourists too. A very nice swimming pool on the roof and a gorgeous club lounge with nice beverage offering if you wanf to chill out.
Staff is also very professional! ",5,2024,03,11
12,My Favourite Barcelona Hotel,First visit in a few years since it was the Crowne Plaza. The rooms are still very nice although I miss the Stressless chairs. Room problem was quickly resolved. Will return as this is my favourite Barcelona hotel due to the large rooms and quiet location. And not forgetting the stunning top floor terrace and views!,5,2024,03,09
12,Ten out of ten,"What a fantastic hotel.

From check in, the wonderful Sandra couldn’t have done more to be accommodating and generous. We were very early to check in, and hoped to just leave our bags so we could explore Barcelona. Sandra made our room available early, gave a free upgrade and even gave us chocolate strawberries and a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our honeymoon. 

The maitre d in the restaurant was also very good, unfortunately I didn’t get his name but was knowledgable and provided exceptional service

The hotel is centrally located so easy to walk into Barcelona, and the rooftop bar is very picturesque.

I hope that we can return to Barcelona soon to stay at the hotel. 

We can’t thank the whole team enough for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,03,02
12,"Every moment of our stay was exceptional, an unforgettable experience.","A wonderful and enjoyable stay at InterContinental Barcelona, on arrival received a warm welcome from the reception desk then invited to Club InterContinental for check-in. Escorted to the lounge we then experienced a seamless check-in truly personalised, polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. 

Our beautiful corner spacious suite was elegantly appointed, having all the comforts expected of a luxury hotel. The bathroom area was large and clean with lovely toiletries by Byredo, and Natura Bissé. Comfortable big King size bed, high thread count linens and feather pillows. Housekeeping very proficient did a great job every day, including the nightly turn-down service. Handwritten card on arrival from the General Manger, also received a second note on our last night, this was nice.

One of the best Club InterContinental experiences, it is truly first class on excellence and quality. A lovely private retreat definitely added a touch of luxury to our stay. The entire team were outstanding, very friendly, ensuring a warm welcome and attentive service throughout our stay. Enjoyed using the fantastic Nespresso Professional Coffee machine it crafted a perfect high quality cup of coffee, I liked very much. Club InterContinental serves a generous choice of premium drinks, very impressed by the Veuve Clicquot Brut Yellow Label champagne served in the lounge. 

A highlight for us was the luxury Spa
InterContinental, amazing thermal circuit a fabulous experience the perfect place to relax and unwind. The staff are very pleasant, helpful and professional. Spa facilities are immaculately clean and smells incredible. Robes and flip flops are supplied to use in the spa. Visiting the spa is a must.

Great swimming pool on the roof which we enjoyed. Stunning panoramic views of the city. Looking forward to returning during summertime to enjoy the roof terrace.

Breakfast served in Arrel Restaurant was great, food quality was excellent, delicious cups of coffee, fresh refreshing orange juice and the omelettes also being very good. I asked about ordering some poached eggs but I was mildly surprised to be told that there would be a charge for this preference however I could order fried eggs for free. I think It would be helpful having some information on what you can order to your table during breakfast. The service was superb and efficient. 

The hotel is well located a short walk from two metro stations, allowing easy access to get around the City. 

Thanks so much for a brilliant stay.",5,2024,01,12
12,Stunning hotel in Barcelona,"Everything is gorgeous and stylish. The rooms are big and have a nice city view. The lounge bar is super cool, and the restaurant has a Michelin star. The rooftop with a pool gives you a beatiful 360-degree view of Barcelona and the hills around. The staff is really friendly and gets things done very effectively

I've been around the world and I've seen my fair share of hotels, and this one easily makes my top three list.",5,2024,01,11
12,"Exceptional Service, Unforgettable Stay","Intercontinental Barcelona exceeded every expectation. The service was truly outstanding—attentive, personalized, and thoughtful at every turn. The room, spacious and comfortable, provided a perfect retreat after busy days exploring the city and working.

The location was ideal—both for business and leisure, offering easy access to key areas. The culinary experience was exceptional, with delectable dishes and breathtaking views adding a touch of luxury to every meal.

The club lounge was a standout, offering not only great food and drinks but also a team of concierges who went above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. It was a delight to have such attentive and knowledgeable staff.

Overall, my time at Intercontinental Barcelona was incredibly pleasant. With its remarkable service, excellent amenities, and prime location, it's a place I will undoubtedly return to for future visits.",5,2023,12,30
12,Trust and comfort coming with people,"Perfect staff… without an exception all reception staff were amongst the bests i have ever met, concierge lady and Mark… The security staff…. 

All these people are the value of this hotel. The trust they give you is the biggest source of the comfort. The clean rooms,  cozy room structure (room 210 was our experience) 8 euro taxi distance to all attractions etc. 

Amongst my best experiences. Thanks to everyone for their contributions.",5,2023,12,20
12,"Good stay, great room, poor food options","Had a couple nights stay at the hotel while I had a good stay, there was one thing that bothered me about the hotel which may make me choose another place next time - food - both in and around the hotel.

I arrived at 4 PM and was looking to eat, having come in from a long and delayed train ride. Only option at that time is room service until 7.30 PM. With the rooftop bar closed and the lobby not serving food, only option to eat was in Arrel(Quirat was closed on the days I was there) which has a limited fine dining menu and was expensive for Barcelona with small portions. Would have loved to see some Spanish/Catalan famous dishes. 

For a city and country with such amazing food and tapas, this is not acceptable. Breakfast was decent - but nothing special given the price of the stay. Would have loved to see some more local options. Service was good with fresh OJ and coffee refills being provided promptly. 

Room was amazing, huge king bed with a lounge area. Turndown service provided.
Spa was expensive for the treatment(starts at around 115 EUR). Hydration therapy pool and sauna/steam should be included for all guests - specially when the rooftop pool is shut. 

Staff were always polite and courteous. Hotel had some conference going on - so we had lots of corporate folks around. Location, while a bit far from the touristy part, worked for me as I could get everywhere in around 15-20 minutes.

I feel if the hotel improves on its food offering, it can more than make up for the location disadvantage it has when compared to other hotels in this price range.",4,2023,12,14
12,Top 5* Hotel ,Perfect 5* Hotel. very comfortable rooms with nice design. Most of the hotel is in beige and white colours. Good executive lounge open during all day till 10 pm and serving alcohol all day long. Breakfast at this loung is just fantastic. Very good and friendly service in the hotel. Once of the best hotels in Barcelona. ,5,2023,12,06
12,Very pleasantly surprised ,"It was our first time in an Intercontinental Hotel and we were excited. Our room and the hotel facilities overall are nicely refurbished recently. We absolutely liked the decor and functionality. Highlight is having a drink on the roof terrace. Once, we come back to Barcelona, we will definitely book the hotel again. We only missed the option to order a snack, like a Club Sandwich, in the bar in the early evening.",5,2023,11,22
12,Wonderful hotel and friendly staff,"Had a wonderful stay, staff very friendly and helpful.  Special mention to Luis at reception whose friendly welcome set the tone for our stay.  Gema at concierge who gave great advice and restaurant recommendations and Miguel at breakfast who was both charming and attentive. Breakfast menu was extensive and was superb.  A visit to the Rooftop bar is a must.  Could not fault our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2023,11,20
12,Sophisticated set-up ,"My wife annI spent a night here during a rapid trip away. The hotel was beautiful from its sophisticated lobby  and the well set-up bar to the welcoming atmosphere in the restaurants. The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of high quality, predominantly local products. 
Our room was very big with a great ambience, comfy bed and fantastic aesthetic. 
The area is very nice too and the staff offer a great service. Would be top on the list for our next trip to Barcelona. ",5,2023,11,16
12,Amazing visit,"Fantastic hotel, loved every minute.

The staff were so professional and polite.

Great location, rooms were wonderful.

The greeting everyday was to be cherished, all the staff were so helpful.

Some of the most comfortable beds we’ve slept in.

Would highly recommend.",5,2023,11,15
12,"Very good, improvement can be in the club","This is a good five-star hotel, no doubt. Well maintained and friendly staff, especially the doorman who was very attentive. We had a club room with lounge access, but there the hotel is not yet on par with the Intercontinentals in Madrid, Singapore or Hong Kong. The lounge is not manned the whole day, and although you can get even alcoholic drinks all day, there is only some cookies and fruit. The selection of tapas from 5 to 7 pm is limited as well. It was weekend, so there were only a few guests, but then you could do a more personalised service, offering a small menu in stead of a buffet. The club has a separate breakfast restaurant, with very attentive staff, but given the few guests there, I would rather trade this for a better lounge experience.",4,2023,11,13

12,A new top destination in Barcelona,"Spectacular new Intercontinental hotel in Barcelona.

Huge rooms, exquisite facilities, terrace, club lounge, Spa, pool and the best service.

Such a great discovery. 

Breakfast was superb.

We went to see the Madonna concert and was great been so close of the stadium and from the city center.

We will come back.",5,2023,11,03
12,Superb.,"We flew from Australia and spent two days prior to our cruise and three days after the cruise at the Intercontinental, we knew it was not in the middle of everything but we tend to stay out of city centres anyway and for us, a good choice.
Due to our status we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was vey well appointed with a huge bathroom, lounge area and study area plus a balcony with table and chairs. The room was quiet and comfortable and very well equipped.
The staff were professional and courteous and at all times and we loved the space the hotel offered and bright modern decor.
Taxies were always available outside the front entrance and we walked to a nearby bus stop for a 15 minute journey to Las Ramblas.
The  Club Lounge was open to members and  was open all day with a selection of wines, champagne and spirits and hot and cold tapas in the evening, comfortable chairs and lounges and a quiet space to work or read.  We also used the Spa area with its many amenities and it was a nice way to relax at the end of each day.
Will definitely recommend.
",5,2023,11,02
12,Excellent 5* hotel in Barcelona,"A brilliant hotel which we cannot wait to return. 
We’ve been looked after specially making our long weekend memorable. 
The team in the club lounge should be congratulated for their expertise. 
Our suite was amazing and I love Bal d’afrique!",5,2023,10,24
12,Not so keen due to staff attitude and room odour 3 star for spa and beautiful decor ,"Warm welcome into a gorgeous hotel lobby, The intercontinental has the wow factor however we had a couple of issues that were disappointing hence 3 stars ratings 

On our room allocation, we had an executive king room which was very spacious however there was an awful smell in the room, so,we went to reception and asked for another room. The second room was the same layout and thankfully the room smell much better however there is an aroma that isn’t nasty but not pleasant either. 

There’s no doubt that the decor in the hotel is very well designed and we were keen to use the facilities.

The first evening we used the spa which was in the basement level, it was small but perfect for what we wanted, we had no treatments but we did use the hydro circuits pool jacuzzi and jets.   We used the sauna and steam facilities and  we felt relaxed. This is an extra payment to use of 45 euros for approx 1 hour use 
The spa closed at 8pm and we used it until that time and then we were keen to have dinner in the rooftop bar. 

We sat at the rooftop bar which had a lovely atmosphere and great views of Barcelona. We were excited to dine for our first night in Spain. our evening did not go to plan. We had ordered a starter and main courses one of which was vegetarian.  We had waited an hour for the food the restaurant was not busy and yey I had to prompt the waitress as a family of 4 had sat near us and got served food before ours and they arrived about twenty mins after we had already sat down and ordered. 
To wait an hour was unacceptable but then when the food did arrive it was our main courses. Our Starters had not arrived. We questioned the manager as he’d taken the order and he basically said oh I forgot to put the order in waited for a reaction and walked off.  
The steak that was ordered as a main was  a substantial meal however the biggest disappointment was the vegetarian dish.  It did not resemble what the menu had suggested  and it was  basically a few slices of aubergine had been put on a plate cooked in slices no taste and a it of garnish.  The key ingredients were not on the plate so honestly the 18 euros was a sliced aubergine and it was Luke warm to cold.
We addressed the situation to a very nice waitress who agreed it was not good and to choose something else so I ordered vegetarian grilled vegetables. By that time I was past eating as I had waited so long and had to wait another half hour for the next order of food so it taken 1 and a half hours if longer to get any food at all.  
The waitress apologised had said it would be free of charge however on getting the bill the manager decided he’d only offer us free drinks- he put his head down whilst talking and retracted what he’d offered earlier. Very unprofessional and he made no effort to put things right only the lady waitress who was very nice and embarrassed.  It was a disaster my husband ate on his  own and mine was cooked 30 mins after he’d had his.  It wasn’t busy so how could it be so wrong for a 5 star hotel to get this right and when it did go wrong the manager dismissed us. Terrible terrible service, we were so hungry we had to spend more money on room service back in the hotel room after we’d left the rooftop restaurant 

Breakfast was a very good selection but the staff seemed stressed with a large order of eggs to cook for a  Chinese airport crew and they left me hanging for ages. 
There was Friction between staff too that was noticeable and English wasn’t well spoken at breakfast  except  for one male waiter. 
Overall lovely hotel close to the museum, and Olympic stadium etc but there are better more central hotels than the intercontinental in nicer locations and better service so we will not be using intercontinental or even recommending it to friends. 
",3,2023,10,22
12,WONDERFUL!!!,"Loved everything about this hotel. The location was great and it was beautifully remodeled. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful in every way I would love to stay here again.  There was a nice bar on top floor with a beautiful view of the city. Since we were out and about early and stayed out late we did not get the opportunity to eat at the hotel, so I can’t review the restaurants.",5,2023,10,20
12,Brilliant hotel with amazing levels of service.,"Stayed from 13th to 16th October for a special ocassion. Room was ready for 1pm which was great. All of the staff are an absolute credit to the Intercontinental/IHG brand. 
My IHG/Intercontinental status was recognised on check in. The rooftop pool/bar/terrace is a pleasure in the sunny weather and on the rainy day we used the spa which again is so relaxing and enjoyable.
Had one very minor issue at breakfast one morning and I only mention it because of how quickly and efficiently this was dealt with. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff here.
The greeting each time you return into the hotel is always very welcoming from concierge right through to the housekeepers.
If you are looking for top levels of hospitality during a visit to Barcelona you will certainly find it here.
The location,facilities services and staff here made our visit extra special. Thankyou.  Muchas gracias  !!",5,2023,10,17
12,Excellent stay in a beautiful hotel,"Our first visit to an intercontinental hotel and we will certainly book again. We arrived early and we fortunate enough to get an early check in . All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful . 
We had food and drinks on the rooftop Terrace with beautiful views of the city . We did feel the drinks were very expensive but worth paying a premium for the views and surroundings . 
Great bedrooms , very spacious and clean . The area the hotel is in felt safe. You can get taxis right outside the hotel. The hotel is not from from the port , airport and gothic area , taxis were reasonable prices",5,2023,10,16
12,An Enjoyable InterContinental Hotel,"I had the recent opportunity to spend one night at the InterContinental Barcelona and generally speaking would recommend it and return if and when I come back to Barcelona. I'm an IHG Platinum Elite Ambassador and so I like to stay at InterContinental hotels around the world when traveling and check out how they compare with each other. The Barcelona location is strong--almost five stars, but not quite. 

First, the positives--the hotel was recently completely renovated from top to bottom--so it's very visually appealing. Well decorated, nice amenities, etc. Beds are comfortable, I like the Byredo bathroom toiletries and the fact that the bathrooms have a separate tub and shower. Room sizes are also very generous which I appreciated. Area of the city wasn't inconvenient (right next to the fabulous Museo Nacional de Arte of Catalonia) and seemed generally quiet at night. (Relatively speaking!) Also it's pretty close to the airport which is great. 

Dinner at Quirat, which is their ""fine dining"" hotel was exactly that--fine dining. I didn't realize that going into the restaurant but I ended up definitely enjoying my dinner at the service was impeccable. It's a price fixe menu--so do be aware of that. 

Where the service fell down a bit was the fact that I showed up at 12:30 pm and check-in is officially at 3:00 pm and they said my room wasn't ready. I understand that it was 2.5 hours early and they did end up calling me a couple hours later (so basically the room was available 40 minutes earlier than the official check-in time) but I really wanted to get in the room and not wait. (Although I didn't push the matter.) Being a Platinum Ambassador I would have expected them to try a bit harder to be accommodating and at least offer an alternative--such as a room of a lower category that might be available now--if the guest is okay with that--but no alternative was provided. And no, the hotel was definitely not full. I'm also not going to pay for a night earlier just to get into the room 2.5 hours early in case that's the management's suggestion. Overall it wasn't that big of a problem but didn't leave me overly impressed with the service despite Judith, the front desk agent, being pleasant-acting in general. So, overall, four stars out of five, and the definite potential for five stars if the hotel can do a better job at prioritizing their guests that prioritize their brand. 

I'd return and recommend it to others.  ",4,2023,10,14
12,5* hotel and treatment - a must visit!! ,"Our friend group booked rooms for the day only between getting off a cruise and our flight home - we spent a fantastic chilled day on the beautiful rooftop terrace with pool - the views were amazing over Barcelona. Our rooms were sumptuous and beautiful. The staff were wonderful, from reception to Sergio escorting us to our rooms, advising on nearby restaurants and later organising taxis etc - 5* hotel and 5* staff. I highly recommend this hotel and only wished we could have stayed longer - we will definitely return!! ",5,2023,10,08
12,Love Intercontinental Barcelona,I loved this hotel for its amenities and sophisticated feel🥰.  And we were able to check in early.  A big bonus after a 12 hour flight.  We did book thru a website that was especially for hotels that you could check in early.,5,2023,10,07
12,Great amenities and service,"Not much to say because it all went smoothly. Room was clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful and efficient. Went there for a professional conference, but could still use what little free time I had to visit nearby museums.",5,2023,10,06
12,Soft beds and quiet spaces ,"Travelling in Europe I can always find a challenge finding a soft bed, intercontinental hotels with a topper are always my go to!
The location of the hotel was nice with lots of restaurants near by. The other thing I loved was the vestibule in the entry of the room. It blocked out a lot of noise from the hallway that always seems to wake me up in the middle of night. I will def be back!",5,2023,10,03
12,Five star service!,"This was the best hotel we stayed during our month long trip through Europe. The service is impeccable. I love the concierge in the
mornings. He is so kind with a fun personality. You can tell he really enjoys his job. The breakfast buffet was amazing. So many options with fresh juice. You are able to order omelettes and any style coffee from your server. The staff in the restaurant worked in harmony to make sure each guest was taken care of. Being a platinum member we were able to get an upgrade to a room with a view of Montjuïc. The room was well appointed, spacious and quiet. It was perfect for our needs. The maids worked so hard to make sure everything was perfect and spotless in the room. We wish we would have made time to try their Michelin Star restaurant and rooftop bar/ pool. Unfortunately my husband and ended up getting a mild flu. This was the perfect hotel to recuperate in.",5,2023,09,30
12,Girls long weekend,"I flew in from Australia and my friend from England. We stayed 3 nights. The hotel and room was lovely , spacious and clean. We had two king single beds and were on the first floor. We could open the window for fresh air which is a bonus. The rooftop pool is small! however fine if you want a coupe of hours sun and a dip after a long day sightseeing. The rooftop pool service was average at best. The staff chatting amongst themselves and not paying attention to guests. They are associated with a beach club which you can go to for 75 euros. It included a towel, sun lounge and transfers. We went and really enjoyed it as Barcelona was very hot when we were there. Front desk service is not the best , issues with communication and charges on final bill. The location is good if you enjoy walking, but is a bit far from major attractions.",4,2023,09,27

12,A real ***** hotel,"Conclusion:
I stayed at Intercontinental Barcelona for 3 night - it is a real 5 star hotel. Everything was perfect from check-in, suite, club lounge and location. 

I look forward to get back.

Review: 
I took a taxi from airport, which I booked via the Uber app. It was EUR 29 for 20 min drive. 

The check-in was fast and efficient, where I from the beginning was send to the club lounges for check-in, because I have  book a room with lounges access. In the club lounges I were welcomed with a glass of champagne. 

I have booked a suite with balcony. The suite was huge, clean and well furnished. The suite was located at the first floor, and it was a bit dark, because there was no sun light in the room or balcony. The wi-fi was fast and easy to connect to. 

I used the club lounges a lot, where I also had breakfast. The breakfast was really good and the lounges is quit and cozy. The lounges serves alcohol during the opening hours, which is different from many other Intercontinental club lounges, where there ofter serves alcohol for a couple of hours in the afternoon. 

The hotel has an amazing rooftop pool with sun beds - very peaceful during the week days, but busy in the weekend. There is full bar service at the rooftop. 

The hotel i located in a local area, where there is a lot of restaurants. I liked the neighborhood, which is more relaxed compared to the hotels at the La Rampla area.",5,2023,09,17
12,Super hotel,Super modern hotel. Rooms are spacious and comfy and the rooftop bar is a great place for a drink overlooking  Barcelona. Is a decent walk from some of the attractions so the Cabify app would be useful. All the staff were friendly and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.,5,2023,09,06
12,perfect spacious hotel,Fantastic hotel  -  nice size rooms for Barcelona.   Service was incredible as always at an Intercontinental.   Early check in and late check out.   We stayed prior to a cruise and it could not have been better.  ,5,2023,09,02
12,Wonderful stay!,"Such a lovely hotel. Nice spacious room and comfortable bed. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. The 173 rooftop bar is next to the pool and both have beautiful views of the city. We would definitely return to this hotel anytime we are in Barcelona.
",5,2023,09,02
12,Beware of them scamming you,"Avoid this hotel at all costs. I prepaid in full for my stay and they told me at checked 'I had not paid enough for my first night'. They then charged my credit card without authorisation. It was 290 Euros. Class to the hotel resulted in excuses saying I had not paid the local taxes (I had) then they reverted to 'I had not paid enough for the first night' ( I stayed for 7 nights).
I had booked through their own website.
I have stayed in many IHG hotels over the years. This Intercontinental is nowhere near the standard of any others I have stayed in Worldwide. As I said at the beginning. AVOID.",1,2023,09,01
12,Great Experience in a beautiful hotel and city!,"Excellent hotel and service - the rooftop bar is epic! Specially in the moonlight. The aircon in the bedroom did not work (these things happen) & Pedro the night manager did a room move at 3pm! 
Special call out to Angel in the rooftop bar for sorting me out a Whisky Sour off the Menu! You sir are a 🌟 Star! 
Well done team IC Barcelona… ",5,2023,08,31
12,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel, every member of staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, very clean and very comfortable (except the pillows which for me were too soft - but it was a minor inconvenience). The rooftop bar and pool were fabulous, a welcome respite after exploring the city. We ate at the rooftop restaurant which was very good, my octopus was delicious. The breakfast buffet was good and had an extensive range of options. The location of the hotel is brilliant,  so easy to walk  to shops, bars, cafes and restaurants in local neighbourhoods. It was away from the crowds but Barcelona’s famous tourist spots were not far to walk to, taxi to or get the subway. We would absolutely come back to the Intercontinental again. ",5,2023,08,30
12,Excellent ,"Excellent service and clean hotel , good breakfast , good location far away from the ramblas between 10 till 15 minutes , the staff in the hotel handsome and helpful people , I highly recommend this hotel ",5,2023,08,23
12,Pleasant Stay,"I recently stayed at the Intercontinental on vacation for 8 nights.  I would definitely stay there again:

Pros:
-It was the most reasonably priced 5 star hotel during the month of August;
-The staff was pleasant and generally aimed to please;
-The rooms are large and the bathrooms are in a separate area from the bedroom -giving a little more privacy;
-it’s located near Montjuic and there are a couple of convenient stores nearby;
-Nice rooftop space with sweeping views of the city, a bar and a restaurant;
-There were regularly cabs waiting nearby and generally you could get to different sites around the city from the hotel for about 10 euros. 

Cons:
-There isn’t a store or shop in the hotel for miscellaneous items or souvenirs.  That may be more of an American standard though;
-The rooftop pool is super small and unimpressive;
-There are only 7 floors to the hotel.  I was on the 3rd floor so the view was underwhelming;
-The walls were a little thin. A basketball team was staying there and blasting music and it was disruptive at night.  I believe there were complaints because each night, there was an abrupt end to the music;
-The room service menu is limited and the food is brought to your room uncovered.  

Overall, my cons are minor.  I would definitely return here.",4,2023,08,18
12,Not worthy of the Intercontinental name / 5 star rating,"Poor experience at the Intercontinental Barcelona - overall the hotel is not in keeping with the level of quality or service I've come to expect from the IHG brand or a 5 star hotel in a major city.

Check-in took forever. Location is average. Staff just ok - really depends on who you speak to. Room is absolutely average. 

Pool facilities are subpar, if these are in any way important then look elsewhere. We enjoy a quick swim & sauna before dinner on our travels - the indoor pool & sauna is 45 euro for a 1 hour visit(!) while the outdoor pool is tiny, cold and facilities surrounding it are inadequate. 

Given the 5 star rating and the brand reputation, this particular hotel location falls short of all expectations. AVOID. 

After having a previously excellent stay at Intercontinental Berlin recently, I am very dissatisfied with the Intercontinental Hotel Barcelona - souch so that I will not be staying again with Intercontinental. ",1,2023,08,11
12,"Comfortable and beautiful, but a little far from the main tourist attractions","I loved our stay at this hotel!!! The rooftop was really pretty and we loved the pool. We received welcome drinks and really enjoyed the food on the roof. The concierge and bellmen were beyond helpful and friendly, which we really enjoyed. The breakfast was convenient with many options, but expensive (to be expected). The beds were the most comfortable that we had during our trip to Europe! The twins seemed bigger than normal twin beds and they were very soft and enjoyable (we are a tall family too). The rooms are modern, spacious, and beautiful. The hotel is located a little far from most of the tourist attractions, but we were still glad we stayed here. ",5,2023,08,09
12,Wonderful hotel and staff !,"Beautiful hotel ! The rooms are large , furniture is gorgeous, bathroom very spacious. Everything about this hotel is exceptional . The Spa, the bar  , the lobby are all very well designed and exquisitely decorated . The view from the rooftop is very nice. 
The staff is outstanding. Very welcoming and professional. A special thank you to Marcelo the concierge who went above and beyond .
Overall a wonderful and can not wait to go back!",5,2023,08,09
12,"Excellent service, terrific breakfast. A+","I was pleased with a spacious room (even of a standard tier), comfortable bathroom with all possible amenities, and the service overall. Many thanks to Renat for the top class check-in experience. And, finally, the breakfast was outstanding, which is another reason I will consider the hotel for my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2023,08,01
12,Good time at IB,"Customer service was great, hotel was modern with really comfortable bedding, room service was of decent quality as well. Downside is it’s a few minutes drive from Plaza Catalunya if you’re planning to spend more time in that area. ",5,2023,07,26
12,Good time in Barcelona,"Well located, nice and renovated hotel.However, the rooftop swimming pool should be cleaned more often to avoid the cloudy water. 
Restaurant with very good food.
Thanks to Priti at the spa for her kindness, very welcome smile and for the good time there!",5,2023,07,23
12,Amazing people,So Im a happy guest leaving the hotel and that's because you have some awesome people working here! Thanks to Ramon for always solving every problem I had and being smiling all the time! Also a big thanks to Miguel from F&B what a guy. He was taking care about me and my wife on the rooftop so good really like this high standard service! And thanks to you Marc for being a great Ihg spirit 👏 hopefully the rest of the reception team will soon be on your level.,4,2023,07,20
12,Worst Hotel Stay in 40 Years,"I started at this hotel from July 7th to 10th with my 14-year-old daughter. 
On arrival we were told that the restaurant would close in 15 minutes but could order something from the bar and could order room service whenever I liked,
But this was untrue after going to the room we headed to the rooftop bar and order a drink and was told the kitchen was closed despite that it was not 10.30 yet,
We had the drink and went to our room and tried to order room service but after 30 minutes trying to get through to room service and reception, I had to go reception and ask what was wrong with the phones, there was no manager on duty at 11.00 so no body could address the problem and was told the manager would talk to me in the morning, THIS never happened, and I had to sent my daughter to bed with any food this is totally unacceptable ,
Next morning, we went to the breakfast buffet and all the food was cold and half the offering were missing, it took 3 attempts to get a second coffee, and this was 70 euros but had to ask as it was not explained on check inn. 
So, the remainder of the stay we decided to eat elewhere,
On the last night we went to the roof top bar to TRY and see sun set and got some snacks,
On arrival we saw some customers getting the menu from the bar and decided to eat something, 
30 second after they order my daughter asked for the menu and was told the kitchen was closed but was were offered a menu for the restraint that was hugely more expensive and not suitable for a child, 35 minutes later the other customer got their food and 10 minutes after other customers order some food at the bar and got served,
After this we had to leave our seat and go out of the hotel to see the sunset on leaving the hotel, we complained to the reception about the service yet again the manager was not available,
On arrive back at 11.00 I approached the reception and aske if my daughter could have a chocolate brownie from the room service and bring it to the roof top and was told it was not possible, at this point I demanded to see the manager but was not available,
Next morning as I checked out 8.50, I asked to see the manger, but he was not available, I asked that he contact me in relation of the bad service, but he never did,
And finally, as he got in the taxi to the airport the Conciergee ask which airline we were flying, and we told him and he sent us to the wrong airport,
I have been staying in hotels around the world for more than 40 yeas and stayed at every level but this was the worst hotel and it cost 5 time more than another hotel around the corner,
Poor customer service,
Poor management,
Poor communications 
Poor quality  
Simply not acceptable!!!!!!!!!! 
",1,2023,07,12
12,One of the better InterContinental Hotels I’ve stayed in!,"My daughters and I spent 5 nights at the hotel.  Our rooms were modern, spacious and well-equipped (including large and beautiful bathrooms).  One of our rooms had a balcony, and the other an amazing view over Barcelona.

We had lounge access, which was very useful as I needed to work a lot of the week while my daughters took a Spanish language course and enjoyed Barcelona.  The lounge was very comfortable, has a very good breakfast (served by very friendly staff) and great tapas between 3-7 p.m.  The ladies in charge of the lounge are both very personable (always engaging with the guests) and professional (helping with planning tourism, reservations, etc.).  The health club is on the small side but has very modern equipment, the spa is terrific and the rooftop restaurant, bar and pool are all great.

I’ve stayed in multiple high end hotels in Barcelona and this is easily in the top two.",5,2023,07,08
12,Amazing stay for my family! Would happily return!,"A beautiful, clean and well maintained hotel with fabulous views of the city. David, Maria, Marcelo, Pedro, Kamel and team were amazing hosts to my wife and our two lil boys! Their attention to detail and knowledge of the city were amazing! They went the extra mile every single day for us, helping with everything from superb restaurant recommendations to entertaining our lil boys with crayons + coloring books. They made this a home away from home for us. When we return to Barcelona, this will be our go to Hotel! Keep it up Team! ",5,2023,07,07
12,No respect for families,"Really disappointing experience all round from check in to check out. After a delightful few days at NH property in Barcelona we decided to move hotels and areas for further exploration. At check in we were told the only “family” rooms available were bottom level even though we always request high floor. We checked in, the room was dark and when I opened the curtains we were looking at a pile of dirt eye level so we were half underground. After politely complaining we were moved to exactly the same room on level 3… miraculously there were family rooms on other levels as well. Bath had no hot water to bath kids, bathroom was dirty in a corner, not enough towels or water for us every day, TV kept losing signal and was unwatchable, safe wasn’t locking, pillows so very uncomfortable. Fridge didn’t work. Upon returning to the hotel one day to drop off bags my son had to urgently use the bathroom. The maid was finishing cleaning and had done bathroom but took much offense, cursing us in Spanish for using our bathroom we paid over 500 euro for each night. Every request took at least 3 asks. Room nice decor and comfortable however nowhere near 5 star rating nor price. Not worth the money, location not convenient and we felt like and inconvenience with children. Won’t be back.",2,2023,07,06
12,Central not overly costly city spa,"Really lovely service from Priti in a quiet, well organised space. Quiet room, sauna, steam room, lots of bubbly water stations and strong jets plus enough space for a gentle swim. Not bad value for Barcelona either so top notch review. Perhaps a water station rather than plastic bottles these days (less plastic=good) but otherwise lovely.",5,2023,07,05
12,Perfect hotel !,"This hotel is perfect. From the start of arrival to our departure, the service, pool area, food, our room and the decor has been wonderful.  Our stay here has been so relaxing. Thank you ! The team on the rooftop are so friendly and professional and a special thanks to Miguel, he has been so nice and friendly. Will definitely be back again.",5,2023,06,29
12,"Relaxing, safe, clean and close to points of interest","Excellent service, clean spacious room, quiet, walking distance to points of interest (museum) wonderful terrace dinner, bar and pool (we chose steak and octopus) and buffet breakfast (order eggs to your preference or omelet), fresh orange juice.",5,2023,06,29
12,A five stars hotel outside tourist area,"Second stop checked into Hotel Intercontinental Barcelona . Checked in was smooth and our room on the fifth floor not only clean but with nice view to the mountain . This 7 stories building the roof top bar has very good view , I suggested must 
try ! More, we really thanks to Marcelo from concierge , he introduced to us one tapas and one fine dinning restaurant in the area which just few steps away , they are excellent !",5,2023,06,23
12,TOP SPOT FOR BUSINESS MEETINGS,"I had to organize a business meeting at intercontinental roof top and the beautiful views, perfect service and food has helped a lot with our clients.

Is by far the top BCN spot for this kind of meetings, will come back!!!

Again, big shootout to the excellent service of the bar. 

Best!!",5,2023,06,22
12,Special Shout Out to Elizabeth at the Club Lounge!,The personnel at Intercontinental barcelona goes above and beyond to make your stay memorable. A special recognition to Elizabeth at the Club Lounge who is very dedicated on customer satisfaction. She diligently helped us with a baggage issue with the airline while they were unresponsive to get us our claim. This commitment shows the par excellence nature. Thank you Elizabeth (Eliza). ,5,2023,06,17
12,Disappointing Stay: Lackluster Service and Unreachable Staff at Intercontinental Hotel,"The hotel service at this particular Intercontinental fell short of the high standard set by other properties in the chain. During our stay, which was accompanied by my mother, a diamond elite member, we were disappointed to discover that there was no special treatment or acknowledgment of our loyalty. The check-in process was frustratingly slow, leading to extended waits for our rooms to be prepared. Despite my mother's elite status, we were not granted any room upgrades or given priority treatment. Furthermore, the staff members displayed unfriendliness and did not deliver the expected level of service.

Our experience at the club was particularly unsatisfactory. The staff exhibited rudeness, and the food selection was surprisingly limited, failing to meet the standards that are expected from an Intercontinental property. Additionally, the turn-down service was missed every other night, which was an unfortunate oversight.

We also encountered difficulties in reaching the hotel staff via phone. Unfortunately, our attempts to contact them were unsuccessful, which added to the overall frustration of our stay. It is essential for a hotel to have responsive and accessible communication channels to address guests' needs and concerns promptly. This lack of availability further contributed to our dissatisfaction with the hotel's service.

Moreover, we found the location of the hotel to be unfavorable.",1,2023,06,14
12,Wonderful experience,I am a frequent visitor to Barcelona and it was my first time to stay at Intercontinental Barcelona. I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The hotel is brand spanking new. In addition the service was top notch. I would go back again.,5,2023,06,10
12,Luxury in Barcelona,"Luxury hotel in Barcelona on a high level. Very stylish. Nice rooms with good size. Good choices at breakfast. Nice spa & gym. Rooftop pool & bar with good views. Great quality on Club  Intercontinental. Few negative things. Cold water in rooftop pool is not ok. Lots of loose tiles in the spa pool. Slow check in in Club Intercontinental when we arrived,but we was offered champagne while waiting. And no dimming on lights in room. All in all a very good hotel",5,2023,06,04
12,Excellent!,"We stayed here for a night after a cruise. We arrived at 8:30am. Not only was a room ready for us, it was amazing. After having a subpar experience at another Barcelona we were overwhelmed by how nice this property was. A true five star experience all around. Rooms were clean, spacious and the staff was very attentive. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,05,23
12,"Great Stay,  Great Location ","We had a peaceful and relaxing day and night during our stay here after our cruise. It was around 16 EU for the taxi ride from the port to here. We were blessed to be able do an early check in before 8am as the front desk helped find something ready for us.  The room was very spacious,  around 500 SF with minimal noise from the outside. Bathroom was spacious with a standup shower, toilet, bathtub all in separate areas. The included breakfast was outstanding and was available starting at 6:30am. We had room service for dinner and our meal was well presented and delicious. We had the fish entree and Iberian ham. Location is so close to multiple tourist sites. We also ordered some hop on, hop off bus tickets from the concierge. It was an 8-minute walk to the bus stop. Overall, an elegant and luxurious hotel that we highly recommend.  ",5,2023,05,10
12,Great views and friendly staff,"A large foyer with amazing lighting welcomed us. The room was a large space and with good aircon. 
While not the closest hotel to major sights, the metro is 5 mins away and buses are very regular. 
The 7th floor terrace bar and sun area / pool offer great views of Barcelona. 
The ground floor bar is a delight. 
I would stay here again.",5,2023,05,06
12,Just average. ,"The good -: nice interior, service was mostly positive. 

The bad -: wifi was slow, breakfast in the lounge was luke warm, hash browns were soggy ect. 
The suite I had was large but had very little natural light and quite a dank feeling. The pool is tiny. 

I wouldn't recommend it unless it's location you are looking for. ",3,2023,05,06
12,A great find…,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights at The Intercontinental recently whilst in Barcelona. We were in the city for The Springsteen concert and the hotel worked well due to its proximity to the stadium and the fact we are loyal IHG members. 

Having stayed at numerous Intercontinental Hotels across the world we thought The Barcelona Intercontinental was one of the best we’ve stayed within Europe! We found check in staff, doormen, concierge and housekeeping all to be efficient and friendly. 

Staff in the executive lounge were an asset to the hotel, particularly the young lady who worked most evenings ( unfortunately her name escapes me). 

Due to our IHG status we had complimentary use of The Spa  - it was a lovely respite from the bustle of the city and we spent a lovely afternoon there. 

The rooftop bar was great, serving lovely cocktails, conversing with fellow guests as we were lucky enough to have great weather, we spent a few hours each day by the pool and always managed to get sun beds. The only slight negative is we found on two occasions the roof top bar closed earlier than advertised, one evening it was windy so fair enough but the other evening the weather was mild so no reason for it to close especially as the hotel was full of concert goers in search of a nightcap!

Overall though we found it to be an excellent hotel, a little out of the main centre but we walked everywhere and found it easy enough to get about without the need for public transport. 

If in Barcelona again as wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again…. ",5,2023,05,03
12,Lovely stay - few little tweaks it would be perfect.,"We came to stay here as part of business trip which was extended for a bit of leisure. Concierge was so friendly from the moment we arrived! 
When we arrived we were too early and were welcomed to get changed for our work trip in the spa where the spa manager was so lovely and helpful. 
When we came back our room was ready and was lovely and spacious! Bed was super comfy. 
We had room service several times and it was always prompt and delicious. 
On our last day my husband booked us a massage each and it was hands down one of the best massages both of us has ever had. Both therapists were excellent. 

A few little things would have made it perfect - 

- We had a little miscommunication on timings for the rooftop bar - when we went upstairs on two occasions there wasn’t any food being served even though reception had said it was open at certain times. So think that needs clarification. 
- The spa was lovely but there were a few of the water features which were broken and some of the tiles were lose at the bottom of the pool and one scratched my foot. We had a treatment so this was included but I wouldn’t have paid 40 euros for this. 
- The doorbells are actually quite loud so in the morning housekeeping are ringing them first thing to clean rooms and you can hear the other rooms which woke us up. 
- Not the hotels fault but a guest was smoking weed at 2AM and our whole floor/room stank. We phoned down and security was called immediately but no one came to speak to us, no apology or follow up.",4,2023,04,24
12,Location and absolutely awesome hotel,"Absolutely beautifully decorated well appointed hotel and rooms. The staff: Camille, the greeter was fantastic, the young man from Poland who registered guests for breakfast was so so friendly; the men at the desks, and the concierge were extremely helpful. One negative critique was the female front desk attendant was rude and unhelpful. ",5,2023,04,14
12,Welcome home,"From the moment you enter, you know you are special. From the doormen's greeting to the check in experience you are made to feel like they really care about you and your comfort. Although we only enjoyed a one night stay, we could have stayed for weeks. The room was very comfortable, the bed was like a cloud and the breakfast was beyond words. ",5,2023,04,13
12,The Club lounge!,"The club lounge! Without a doubt one of the best IC lounges. Champagne and good snacks all day. All the staff in the hotel are excellent and especially Bruno with his staff in the lounge. 
Nice room and comfy bed. House keeping is very  thorough. ",5,2023,04,13
12,"Superb Hotel , Far from attractions","Barcelona Intercontinental was one of the best hotels that I’ve ever had . Huge Rooms , friendly staff , Clean and tidy Bed , Really nice breakfast . 
The only thing about this Lovely Hotel is the distance from Barcelona’s attraction . 10 min drive to Rambla.",4,2023,04,08
12,Best Intercontinental Property in Europe ❤️,"Best Intercontinental Property in Europe ❤️

Bruno, Eliza, and the entire team, we will always appreciate your hospitality and the impeccable service you’ve provided to me and my friends during our stay.

The club lounge was an amazing place to hang out.

One feedback is that the breakfast spread could do a little more variety. But nevertheless our stay was perfect! And the room was very nice.

Thanks again and hope to be back soon!",5,2023,04,02
12,Fabulous stay!,"We had an absolutely amazing stay.  

Location of the hotel is good -  about 7 mins walk from Plaça d'Espanya so well connected. 

Our room was spacious and modern with views of the city. 

The staff were beyond friendly and helpful at all times. 

We had access to the Club Lounge which served lovely tapas and drinks for several hours each day. We also had breakfast here - some of the nicest waffles I've ever had! 

The rooftop restaurant has some amazing views, and served the nicest sangria we had on the trip.",5,2023,04,02
12,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Stayed 3 nights with my wife for a birthday celebration in a king room with club access. We had stayed here 3 times before when it was the Crowne Plaza and were interested as to whether the standard would be the same. The standard met our expectations and the 5 star rating is deserved. The room was spacious, very comfortable and clean. All the staff are polite and engaging. We thoroughly enjoyed the club lounge where both alcohol and soft drinks are available through the day. The reception within the club lounge is managed by staff who are professional and very engaging. A special mention to Martina to say thanks for looking after us during our stay. All in all this is now our 4th stay at the hotel and we will return again. Recommend. Pan & Sean",5,2023,03,30
12,Great Place to Stay !,We had a 4 night stay here and felt welcomed and valued. Staff was very helpful getting transportation. They were also great in supplying an ice pack for my sore foot on 2 occasions . Service was great everywhere. The breakfast buffet was delicious though a little pricey. Our room was comfortable and well supplied. We had issues with our air conditioning and it was fixed promptly. The location was perfect for us to see everything we wanted to around the city- it is a short walk away from the hop on hop off bus as well as the National Museum of Art and Palau Sant Jordi ( if you are taking in a concert),5,2023,03,22
12,Beautiful hotel .. at centre of Barcelona … Amazing service and big and very clean rooms,"Excellent services with amazingly clean hotel at just few mins from city centre and train terminal … very big room perfect for families on holidays , extremely supportive staff … they welcome you every time you enter the hotel not the gate man but a person standing specially to ask and assist you … never seen at Any place ✌️👍… overall an amazing hotel with good food and very clean rooms",5,2023,02,24

They made our trip more interesting with her advices & tips about the city ,shops,restaurants bars are within walking distance. 

Stunning city views from the rooftop terrace.

Do not miss to enjoy an amazing dinner at their jewel Quirat restaurant. Never before we have enjoyed a better tasring menu than the one offered at this restaurant. High class local taste. 

Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality. Thank you again for going just that little step extra for the guests.",5,2023,02,22
12,Bruno and IC were amazing!,"Amazing experience, Bruno was the best. Made us feel very welcome…amazing knowledge of Barcelona, and made us feel very welcome in the Lounge. Martina was amazing as well. The facilities, room, spa and especially lounge were spotless. Spend the extra money on Intercontinental, you will not regret it!",5,2023,02,18

Big rooms in good conditions. Good restaurant with good vine selection. Not far from the subway station. Friendly and helpful staff. Not cheap, but good value for money.",5,2023,01,15
12,Pleasant Hotel BUT Very Noisy outside,"Great size room, pleasant staff. The noise outside was deafening and made it impossible to sleep. It is very unfair of hotels to play such loud music when they have rooms so close to the source being hugely affected. I do not recommend this hotel if you want to get a good night’s sleep",2,2022,12,30
12,A lovely stay in a beautiful hotel,"The welcome we received at this hotel was excellent, our room was spacious and comfortable, the club lounge extensive and open all day - and the roof top area with its views over the city is beautiful.

Staff are professional whilst still friendly, and barman Federico made some of the best drinks we have ever had.

The location near the Fira Centre  allowed us to be within walking distance of much that we wanted to see and only a short taxi ride from the port when we took our cruise.  We can’t wait to return !!",5,2022,12,18
12,Flawless stay at InterContinental Barcelona,"Lovely hotel. The staff is brilliant and they did set up everything to make my stay one to remember. The food at Quirat Restaurant is outstanding and they have an amazing rooftop where we enjoyed incredible views from the whole city. The Club lounge was perfect too. They serve tapas during the afternoon which were delicious and the attention recieved couldn't be better.

We will be back for sure!",5,2022,12,16
12,Amazing property,"Everything was perfect everyone was taking care of us we had a perfect stay from the suite to the club intercontinental and restaurant.
A big tanks to Bruno from the club lounge who helped us for everything  and  many thanks to the staff of the QUIRAT restaurant we had a good experience in the restaurant.
We had a very nice experience in the InterContinental Barcelona and we will come back for sure.",5,2022,12,14
12,Would be better with honest information to customers,"Customers need to get correct information on their bookings. This is not the case of my stay here this weekend. Booked  a 2 nights stay for a classic room with the ambassador certificate. A couple of days ago I did get the message I was upgraded to a one bed room suite with a street view as I’m on Diamond Elite level. 
Thank you. 
But when checking in just before 15.00 today -”the room was still dirty so we will give you another room”. Is it of the same level? Yes -  said the receptionist - and as this is the first time for me at this hotel I had no idea how suites in this  hotel look like. I thought it was strange how the room i did get was called a ”one bedrom suite” - as it is .. a room.  However - when checking the IHG App i saw that i was given a room that was a ”king bed classic room” - the same room i had booked. Maybe the upgrade was ”castle view” and yes if i press my cheek to the window I can see the Montjuic castle … So a kind advice to this hotel; inform the customers correctly - in this case if the room promised is not ready - ask the customer - ”are you willing to wait until the room is ready - or do you accept a room of lower standard right away?” And do NOT say the room  ”Classic king bed of 42 m2” is the same standard as the ”One bed room suite of 55 m2” (especially noting at 1900 hours that there are 4 one bed room suites available - the rooms promised in the e-mail on upgrade given)
Next time I’ll be in BCN I will book the Indigo hotel .",1,2022,12,09
12,Wonderful stay at Intercontinental Barcelona,"My husband and I arrived in Barcelona a couple of days ahead of our cruise departure and elected to stay at the IC BCN. It was fairly close to some of the sites we wanted to see and could get others easily. We had a good room and the Club was terrific for breakfast and nightly appetizers. Easy access to the Hop On and Hop Off Bus for an easy overview of BCN. Great and friendly staff! Only potential downside is it is close to the Congress center so if there is a big convention in town the hotel could be packed with convention attendees.

There is a great little market kitty corner to buy water or anything you forgot!",5,2022,12,02

12,"Amazing Hotel, we were really looked after.","Where to start.....OMG, this hotel is amazing, spacious, clean, modern, and nothing is to much trouble. We had access to the Lounge which is a must and worth paying the extra. Inside there are drinks refreshments mega comfy seating, large screen TV and BRUNO.
Bruno is the concierge who knows everything and everyone, if you need tickets he will do his upmost to acquire them, he can recommend the best places for Tapas and food, the best bars, in fact he is like a human version of Tripadvisor for Barcelona city. He always greeted us with drinks when we visited the lounge and chatted to us about our day, we loved this guy he is a legend.
The Roof Terrace is a fantastic place to go for a drink and something to eat they do a fantastic Paella, and the views are awesome.
I loved this hotel and will go back without hesitation....... my only observation is, a couple of nights we sat down in the main bar which is a lovely place with a great atmosphere and some nights they have live music all good except the bar do not serve food, this one thing stopped us from spending more time there in the evening as we would pop in for a quick drink and then leave to eat elsewhere.",5,2022,11,10
12,"Wonderful, high end five star hotel in a quiet neighborhood.","Wonderful, high end 5 star hotel. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Staff was knowledgeable and accommodating. Breakfast was amazing. Wonderful rooftop restaurant. Location is in a quiet area near the National Catalonia Museum.  You get what you pay for.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,11,05
12,Excellent,"Lovely stay at this hotel. From the time we checked in to leaving, it was the perfect stay. Special thanks to Pedro who checked us in and arranged a complementary upgrade. The room was very spacious and clean with a very large double bed, large bathroom with a walk in rainfall shower. All the staff we encountered were very nice and friendly especially the concierge Marcelo who looked after us by arranging our trips and helping us with where to visit to see the best of Barcelona. One highlight was finding out the inter Milan team were due to check in, hey if it’s good enough for them.lolOne must do is a beer on the rooftop terrace which has lovely views of the city. The hotel is a little bit away from some attractions although a taxi typically only cost us around 10-15 euros. Will definitely return here one day.",5,2022,10,22
12,Very nice stay,"We had an excellent stay in the hotel!
It’s beautifully renovated, clean and classy.
Upon arrival we were upgraded to a top floor room which was huge and very comfortable with a big couch and a big size bed. Also, there is a door on between the room and the entrance area so no noises from the corridor. 
Bottles of water were complimentary as well as nespresso capsules.
The only issue with the room was the noise from the rooms next door. You can clearly hear the neighbours but fortunately they were quiet in the evenings. We only had an issue one night, we woke up at 1am due to screaming and loud noises. We had to call reception, they sent security and they solved the problem.
We had access to the club lounge, the selection of drinks and snacks were good, and the club breakfast was perfect! 
The only thing we were not satisfied is the rooftop bar. Though the setting is very beautiful, the bar is understaffed. We were sitting there 20 mins to be recognized and when finally we cathed the girl that we would like to have a menu, after 20 mins of waiting to get our orders we just left.
Complaining at the reception we were offered to chane our drink cards to points.
The location perhaps is not ideal for everybody but for us it was completely fine, many restaurants and shops nearby and the beautiful palace and the gardens are just a few mins walk from the hotel.",4,2022,10,22
12,Good hotel,Stayed here in July prior to watching an Iron Maiden concert up the road.  The room was huge with two doubles.  Staff at the hotel were great...front desk and concierge were just so helpful and found us somewhere to store our bikes overnight.  Rooftop pool/bar is a cool place with nice views.  Great stay. ,4,2022,10,12
12,Not what you expect,"Construction disruption when we asked for a quiet room whilst travelling with a 2 year old. There was early morning noise which ruined the stay. The staff moved us but to a room without balcony. no access to spa whilst paying a premium for the stay. Eliza, Bruno and Sandra tried their best to make the stay good but due to these little issue I mark this hotel to be overpriced and no effort from GM to make the staff worthy regardless of the value of your staff. 
It's good location for business travellers and the walk down to magic fountain makes it nice place to be but overal i highly recommend to not rely on the pictures and text on the various websites. Intercontinental barcelona doesnt match the 5 star luxury value. ",3,2022,10,10
12,Excellent hotel,"We really enjoyed our 2 stay at this hotel.  I have been to Barcelona many times but had never stayed in this area- Mountjuic.  The hotel is very near the Magic Fountain and castle and is only about a 15 min walk to the Barri Gotic.  The lobby is beautiful.  Marc made our check-in wonderful and told us everything we needed to know.  Our room, a club king with a balcony- was spacious, well designed and comfortable.  The bed, linen and pillows were excellent.  The club served a fantastic breakfast and drinks and nice little snacks in the evening.  The spa area was very nice and a great place to relax at the end of the day.  The service throughout the hotel was excellent.  Overall, it was a great stay, and I highly recommend.",5,2022,10,09
12,Perfect hotel for our visit,My husband and I stayed at this hotel while we were in Barcelona and loved it! The room was very spacious and clean. The rooftop bar was the perfect place to get a drink before dinner. The view is amazing! The service was great! The bed in room was so comfortable that we slept for 12 hours one night without even knowing it. The hotel is very quiet. The staff throughout the hotel are all very nice and helpful. The breakfast is very good! They also have taxis always waiting right outside the door so no need to worry about how to get around. We had rented a car but chose to use the taxis because driving in Barcelona is a little crazy and it was so convenient. I would definitely recommend this hotel!,5,2022,10,09
12,Disappointing Club,"We always stay club in any hotel we stay in the world. So, we once again paid extra to stay in a clubroom in this hotel and this was by far the worst club experience we have ever had. The food available in the lounge from 15.00 to 19.00hrs, was an extremely under welcoming small selection of food, it was not replenished, so if you arrived at 18.00hrs (as we did), most of the food had gone. Tables were often littered with dirty plates. I had to ask Lisa (i think this was her name) for the tables to be cleaned one evening as there was no clean tables available. There were no real AF options available at the club 2hr hot tapas...there was 1 choice of AF beer (and as beer is a predominantly a male drink it was like females who do not drink alcohol had not been considered).   I complained to Bruno...who sarcastically pointed out that water / orange juice and Coke was AF...(this is like offering a vegetarian... carrots or cucumber as a vegetarian option) ...I replied there are hundreds of AF spirits on the market and also AF wines...( incidentally Gin / Martini and even wines were even sold at Barcelona Airport, so are easily available in Spain}. And incidentally these are at a fraction of the price of a bottle of champagne!  I pointed out that other Intercontinental club lounges we had stayed in before had mocktails available. Bruno rudely suggested that I was welcome to leave and use the hotel bar where mocktails were readily available. (Which leads me to my next question...why were these not available in the club lounge? could this be because they had no staff?)  After I told him i was not happy he begrudgingly offered to get me a mocktail. So, in my 5 days stay I got 1 mocktail but only after making a complaint. Breakfast was bad also. Again, no staff. I had to walk to reception one day to get someone to get a staff member to get me some tea. When the waitress arrived, she was so stressed as she was over worked.  And on the last day I was offered tea in a pot without as lid as they had run out of lids. REALLY! During our stay we also reported that there was no hot bath water. We complained 3 times on 3 separate days... then and only then we were moved rooms. If the hotel could not fix the problem, they should have moved us on day 1. I am so disappointed with probably everything that the Club offered at this hotel, so much so, that I am going to take this complaint to the Intercontinental head office. The intercontinental hotel group was our hotel of choice, we have stayed in the brand in the Far East multiple times. Where the club’s rooms and lounge ...has been nothing short of amazing.  BUT Barcelona Club was of an **appalling standard**.",2,2022,10,06
12,Clean - friendly and fresh ingredients and room was top as should be for 5 star,"Arrived late in the evening and was welcomed very warmly at the reception, very good bed.M, shower and bad and the breakfast was very fresh with some great cappuccino’s. The terrace is clean an beautiful and the prices are still ok. Will come back again! Thanks all",5,2022,10,03
12,Lovely stay with fantastic Service,"The highlight of our trip was definitely the service that we received from the staff, In particular Wuan & Luca at the root top bar was amazing with their recommendations. Jordi in the bar at the Lobby was incredible, his attention to detail, his service, recommendations and his knowledge had us in awe. Gemma the concierge gave us great options for transport and recommendations around the area. Miguel in training and Judith at the front desk was warm and welcoming along on arrival. Sergio from the door team was lovely and always smiley.",4,2022,10,01
12,Excellent Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. Great customer service is combined with luxurious and comfortable rooms. There is also a fabulous rooftop terrace with spectacular views and a pool. Staff are friendly and helpful. 

Highly recommend this hotel; we will certainly return.",5,2022,09,29
12,Great Stay! Friendly service!,I   stayed here because it was closer to the port for my MSC Cruise. Ther we alwasy cabs our front so it was not an issue getting a cab the day I   was getting on the cruise.  When I   arrived from teh airport at 7am they actually said my room was ready!! WHAT!!  And they were very very friendly with assisting me with all of my questions and making dinner recommendations and reservations.  They couldn't have been more helpful .My room was large and clean.  It was comfy as well!  The bathroom was spacious and clean. The included breakfasts a large buffet that was deicious  and the waitresses  were also very friendly.   Great hotel!!,5,2022,09,25
12,"Marcelo, the concierge,  was great!",The hotel is very located very close to the MNAC and were able to get around to most of the Las Ramblas sites within 6-10 EU cab ride.  The hotel is very clean and the rooms are big. The breakfast came with our room rate and was fabulous. You could also order a la carte style menus.  Marcelo the Concierge was fabulous and helped us very much. He made our stay much better.  I thought the hotel was centrally located and easy to get to. Lots of cabs are accessible. We also got a free trip to the spa!,5,2022,09,14
12,Superb Hotel and service.,"What an amazing hotel, very comfortable and well maintained. Staff so friendly and helpful especially the doormen/bellhops.
Breakfast was lovely and checkout so seamless that made the stay eve so more pleasant. In truth, it was exactly what you would expect from intercontinental hotels.",5,2022,09,12
12,Great experience and Wonderful staff,"My wife and I stayed at InterContinental Barcelona in August 2022 and had a pleasantly holiday. Wonderful staff. Miss Gema is very friendly and kind. Most importantly she is knowledgable and go above and beyond to welcome you and make you fell comfortable. we had very memorable night in Ibiza's restaurant  that she told us. 
Thanks Gema :)",5,2022,09,11
12,A few minor issues but very good hotel.,"Nice hotel and helpful staff, and the bars are great, the only issue is that it is a little far from the action and you need a taxi to get to La Rambla and other popular areas for example.

The fountain show within a few minute walking distance of the hotel runs every night at 9:30 and it worth a visit.

Rooms are clean and comfortable, but there is construction going on next door, which was a little annoying.",4,2022,08,31
12,Best hotel ever,"I booked a two night post cruise stay here. 
The service and room were super.
Some of the staff that enhanced or stay were Sergei and David at the entrance, Sandra who checked us in and Claire who helped us at the dining room.
Room was spacious and had both a tub with grab bars and a stall shower.
Breakfast buffet had a great selection of various items and the chef cooked eggs to order.
Lunch and dinner was challenging as the dining room and rooftop restaurant alternated lunch and dinner.
If I ever return to Barcelona I definitely would stay here.

PS they even remembered  my birthday with a bottle of champagne and special chocolate dessert delivered to our room!",5,2022,08,19
12,Romantic Trip,"Good location in a quiet place of town, property is very nice with a modern design. We really enjoyed the bar, the scotch selection and service. Housekeeping was very nice and always on top of our needs. The best part of the stay was meeting the concierge Gema Villar the first day. Gema was incredibly helpful from the moment we met her, coordinating our stay in Barcelona and helping further with our next destination. She definitely went beyond any expectations, making our trip a memorable one. I am so glad that Intercontinental Barcelona has Gema as team member.",5,2022,08,12
12,"Experienced nothing like it , in all my years of travelling.","Normally ‘we don’t talk about Bruno’ but in this case we have to.His exceptional kindness, hospitality and professionalism made our holiday.He and his colleagues go above and beyond their duties to make you feel as if you are part of the Intercontinental Barcelona family.

Every service is outstanding from the hall porters/concierge l/réception to the room service and terrace staff.We were particularly impressed with the Club Lounge and how Bruno and his team ( including Armand) make you feel welcome, but also at home.

When we come back to Barcelona again next year, it will be to this hotel because we’ve never experienced anything quite like it in all our years of travelling.",5,2022,08,11
12,Wonderful Stay,"This hotel was perfect for our pre-cruise stay in July.  The rooms are spacious and quiet with excellent temperature control.  The bed was very comfortable.  We included the lounge and it was such an oasis after touring each day.  The staff members of the lounge were impeccable and friendly.  Taxis were always available just outside your door.  We were able to take a morning walk around the neighborhood that was quiet and full of green parrots - an unusual treat for us.  In the evening, you can easily take in the fountains.  The old quarter was just too crowded for my taste, so I am glad we stayed here.  I will admit, if you are looking for a pool, this is not the place.  But, if you want an upscale, clean, climate controlled, quiet environment to return to, this place is wonderful.  The breakfast in the lounge was much more than I expected with hot order items and interesting buffet items.  I would definitely return.",5,2022,08,09
12,Amazing stay,"The location of the hotel is very good. The Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The hotel staff is friendly and hospitable. 
There’s a magical musical show happening in the evenings which is at a walking distance from the hotel. And the show is amazing. 
Hotel has a rooftop swimming pool and a bar. 
They also have a spa, Sona and steam room too. One can just relax in the spa with hydrotherapy. It’s wonderful.",4,2022,08,08
12,We Loved It!,"My husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Barcelona on July 21 and 22nd. From the moment I booked the hotel I was impressed. I needed help with securing a transfer from the airport and they immediately got back to me. When I needed to secure tickets to attractions, they got back to me right away. It's a beautiful hotel, and from the moment we arrived, we were treated so well. They have an amazing rooftop terrace restaurant with incredible views of the city, and it's within walking distance to Montjuic and the Magic Fountain (highly recommend). The room was comfortable and nice, and the shower was fabulous! If you really want to be ""wowed ""in terms of food, enjoy the buffet breakfast. Everyone was amazing, but we want to especially give a shout out to Juan and Sergio - on a scale from one to ten we give them an 11! We fell in love with Barcelona and this hotel!",5,2022,08,05
12,A really nice stay,"We spent a night in the Intercontinental after a long day on the train from Paris and it was an absolute delight.  The twin room had two queen-sized beds and lots of space, the aircon was fantastic (and very welcome).   Really comfortable sitting and working areas, and the room faced on to a courtyard away from the street noise.  I think the bed is the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel, and I slept brilliantly.

The location is a bit out of the way if you're wanting to do all the very touristy things in the old town but handy for all the things to do on Montjuïc.  There are usually taxis waiting outside so very easy to get to where you want to go if you don't fancy walking to the nearest metro station.

We did have a bit of a wait for room service but it was Saturday night.  The staff on reception were extremely helpful throughout our trip.",5,2022,08,01
12,Poor Customer Service & No Hot Water for 8 hours,"I had a poor experience at this hotel with customer service.
The Check in staff were very rude to me and most everyone else who was in line.

In the evening, there were multiple power outages.
By 11pm there was no hot water, and when I showered at 0500 to catch my flight there was no hot water.

The Front Desk staff was completely unapologetic. They told me to contact and email the Manager -- Sandra Aparicio. I have emailed her 3 times to complain about the hot water issue and rude staff. To date, she has not responded.

Although the hotel itself is very nice, it is far from the main attractions.
There is a $40 charge to use the indoor pool/sauna/steam room for 45 minutes.

The gym is underground and very dark and small.

This hotel is a poor value for the price.",3,2022,07,30
12,Exceeded expectations,"Staff couldn't have been nicer particularly Guillermo, Alex and David at the 173 roof terrace restaurant. It was so lovely to eat dinner up there every night. Room (king) was huge, very clean and very comfortable. 
It would be great if there were a few more sun loungers at the pool - or if towels were removed when they were being used to save loungers for several hours.",5,2022,07,28
12,Poor service & not value for money,"I’ve stayed at over 20 InterContinental hotels, and this was the first time I was expected to pay to use the steam room and sauna. I can understand paying for treatments, but 40 EUR for each visit is not acceptable. This charge was not made clear on the website when I booked.
The pool on the roof (which is free to use), is fine for paddling but too small for swimming lengths.
My room was directly opposite the lifts, and I could hear the ‘ping’ sound every time the doors opened. People having conversations whilst waiting for the lift could also be clearly heard inside the room.
The room pictures on the hotel website show a TV with a Netflix logo on the screen. I took this to mean that Netflix was available, or that guests would be able to log into their own account. This wasn’t the case, so the presence of the Netflix logo is misleading.
The hot water in the shower fluctuated without touching the taps. On a few occasions I had to jump out after the water suddenly changed to a scalding temperature. The full-size bottle of shower gel ran out during my stay. Despite requesting a new one from housekeeping, it never came.
When I checked out and settled my bill, my card was charged in British pounds rather than Euros, without asking my permission. The exchange rate used for this conversion was poor and cost me more than if I had settled in Euros.
All these points mean that the prices charged do not reflect the service that is delivered.",2,2022,07,28
12,"Beautiful hotel, clean and spacious room, great lounge service, secure carpark.","Stayed here for a week with my son in July 2022, the room is very clean, modern and spacious. Booked the package with lounge access, which offers all day all inclusive drinks and snacks as well as an extremely well appointed buffet breakfast on the ground floor cafe. Roof top bar / restaurant has a 360 degree view of Barcelona extending all the way to the ocean. ALL staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The secured carpark in the basement is an added bonus, we did not have to worry about leaving our car parked on the street. The area surrounding the hotel was peaceful and quiet yet I have been able to find quite a few fantastic restaurants within 10 mins or less of walking distance. The Spa is also excellent, had a massage there and spent some time at the Spa facility. Will definitely return!!",5,2022,07,26
12,10/10,"The most stunning hotel! Beautiful decor, spotlessly clean and the most divine smell at all times.

We got upgraded on arrival as it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and Bruno gave us a drinks voucher which we really appreciated.

Rooftop bar views are amazing! Only downside I would say is that there isn't enough beds around the pool to accomodate everyone. 

Our favourite bit of the hotel however was the downstairs bar. Jordi the bar man was simply amazing at making cocktails for us, and we had such a lovely time chatting to him every night. He really made this hotel 5* for us.

Hotel is a bit outside of the centre, but taxis are always outside hotel and it makes it alot more peaceful. 

We will definetely return here when we come back to Barcelona!!",5,2022,07,26
12,Poor Customer Service,"The rooms are spacious. The hotel is beautiful and well located (near Montjuic Castle).
The most surprising thing for this type of hotel, is the poor quality of customer service. The room service was not reachable by phone. We had to go to the reception to order diner and one third of the order was missing. We can hear unpleasant noises near the room. I have requested a room upstairs and got a room located in the lowest floor with a lot of noise around. 
The service in this hotel need a serious upgrade. Based on the service provided, it does not deserve 5 stars. ",2,2022,07,24
12,Spacious and comfortable room with great views,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights for a conference. The room I stayed in had recently been refurbished, and it was very large and modern with a comfortable bed and good facilities, including a Nespresso machine. The view from my room was the Palau Nacional de Montjuïc. 

The staff at check in were very nice, as were the bar and restaurant staff. I needed to speak to the concierge for some restaurant bookings but unfortunately he wasn't very helpful and wasn't available very often. It was quite difficult to get problems sorted at this hotel, for example the safe in my room did not work. Someone came to look at it but it was not fixed, and I didn't have the time to keep ringing guest services to have it sorted out. One evening after a very late finish I attempted to call room service to order a meal. Though I was calling within operating hours, no one bothered to pick up the phone. I spent twenty minutes repeatedly calling, but my calls went unanswered. 

Unfortunately the service is not up to par for a hotel at this price and rating. I wouldn't consider staying here again.",3,2022,07,15
12,Medium not Premium,"From a newly rennovated hotel, part of an international 5 star brand, you would expect a lot better.

The overall upkeep is not up the bar. Pool area chairs are tired without yearly upkeep, gym is dirty without staff keeping it clean, breakfast is spanish type but not international at all, very limited options and totally not worth it. 

Service is a lot of empty promises, and the concierge lady’s compensations were totally not worth it. For getting a totally wrong room type than what you ordered with two small beds for one person for the first night, compensation of 1k IHG points is a joke. Waste of money and bad service.

Some good points were this one nice male bar tender at the pool, with a cap and glasses, he understood good customer service. Same with a the night time concierge man, very kind. Room cleaning and breakfast staff were also very fast.

But overall I would say if you feel like staying in Barcelona, put some more money to places like Hotel Arts, or stay in a lot cheaper better quality places. Intercontinental Barcelona doesn’t offer worth for your money, nothing Intercontinental worth about it.",3,2022,07,14
12,exceptionally poor service for being an intercontinental,"I am saddened and deeply disappointed by the quality of service and attitude of the staff during my stay. I have received better service in hotels with fewer stars in Barcelona than this one.

I went to check in early, and there weren't any rooms available which is understandable, but I didn't get a room until almost 5 PM!. I practically had to beg to give me any room because I needed to shower and change for a meeting, and I ended up getting an inferior room, no compensation, not even access to the club lounge.

The staff by the pool refused to add the bill to the tab because I didn't have any credit on my room (not sure what this meant). After 1 hour of repeatedly telling them, it needs to be added to the room so that I can avail the benefit of an ambassador, they did it.

The day of departure, the cleaning staff kept on coming into the room every 45 mins since 8 AM and without knocking. One time I was getting dressed, and the other times it interrupted my video conference constantly. 

The person that did the checkout didn't even asked me how was my stay, they just did the checkout took the payment and bye-bye (it wasn't even busy)

Completely unacceptable, I wouldn't recommend the intercontinental in Barcelona there are better choices to choose from where your business would be better appreciated, I'm not asking to be treated like a king, but a little acknowledgement to their loyal customers goes a long way, I am cancelling all of my future reservations here and will stay at the Melia Sky.",2,2022,07,10
12,Truly Professional and Enjoyable Hotel,"We stayed for three nights in the Intercontinental Barcelona last month. We are regular Intercontinental guests and had already had some contact with the hotel before arrival. We were greeted like old friends and checked in fast by Pedro and shown to the Club Lounge before going to our room.

Our room was lovely, with a good space - handy for lots of luggage and the bathroom lovely. As usual in the Intercontinentals the bed was so comfortable that we just didn’t want to get up once we were in it.

The Club Lounge was excellent and we were superbly looked after by Bruno and Fabio over the three nights. Both guys are true assets to Intercontinental and were so welcoming and very professional. As well as lovely drinks, they also served hot and cold tapas.

We thoroughly enjoyed three breakfasts in the lounge, it felt like there weren’t many guests, however a magnificent breakfast spread was laid out every morning and we both say one of the best lounge breakfasts we’ve ever had. We were constantly looked after by Lupe, she quickly knew what we liked and made sure we had the right coffees etc.

We also spent some time on the beautiful rooftop terrace. The team again were so welcoming and all looked after us so well especially Juan who had great banter with my husband.

When we checked out on the last day, we felt truly refreshed despite doing quite a lot of sightseeing. We are hoping to be back in Barcelona soon and will book this hotel without hesitation.",5,2022,07,06
12,Excellent ! True 5 star with 5 star service,"I would say I was impressed with this hotel - brand new hotel which combines chic atmosphere with high quality service and good food. 

Pros - 
- Brand new refurbished to very high standard 
- high spec rooms 
- top customer service & extremely friendly treatment which is hard to find in Spain , staff clearly are well trained and eager to please 
- great food 
- magnificent panoramic views over Barcelona 
- close to Montjuic palace which is a beautiful monument 

Cons -
- the one downside is the food at the rooftop restaurant takes far too long. On all 5 days we were there the food took 1 hour to arrive! Other guests have complained too. Hotel mgmt is aware and is looking into it . 

NB. A special mention to the bellboys (David/Elder) & reception & to those working at the rooftop you were phenomenal. Thx for hosting us so politely and making our stay with the baby a pleasure. 

",5,2022,06,28
12,Perfect weekend!,"I've recently returned from a long weekend in Barcelona and my first stay at an Intercontinental hotel. Happy to report that the hotel, and the city, were perfect. I had a lovely time in both. 

I need two things in whatever hotel I'm staying: a comfortable bed and a quiet environment for a good night's sleep. The bed was huge and really comfortable and the sound proofing in the room was impressive. Not a sound from the street outside and nothing to complain about from within either. Hotels usually remember to install double glazing but then completely neglect internal soundproofing. (I stayed in an expensive Barcelona hotel some years ago and was woken up by an alarm clock in the next door room.) On this trip, however, I felt positively cocooned and all was quiet. 

I had a room with access to the Club Lounge so was able to have a peaceful breakfast, and cups of coffee/cold drinks/nibbles throughout the day. I had a couple of evening meals at the rooftop restaurant: good food and excellent views across the city. Staff here and throughout the hotel were friendly, courteous and helpful, perhaps as you'd expect from a quality establishment, but still good to experience. 

The room itself was large and had everything required, including plenty of coat hangers in the wardrobe. I didn’t watch the TV so can’t comment on what channels were available, but there was a large and comfortable sofa, desk and chair, coffee table, safe, complimentary bottled water (replenished every day) and a coffee machine. The bathroom had one of those amazing rain forest showers. Everything was spotlessly clean.  

The location of the hotel also, by chance, suited me well as it’s only a four-minute walk to the Montjuïc fountain and light show which takes place at this time of year at 9.30pm. In almost 30 years of visiting Barcelona I had never succeeded in seeing it until now. Well worth it. 

I like the fact that the hotel is not right in the very centre of the city, which probably adds to the peaceful feel of the place. I shall happily stay there again.",5,2022,06,20
12,Good but not great,"The staff were generally vey helpfull, Hotel Very clean and Room comfortable. The pool area is easily crowded and the pool looks a lot bigger on the website. The breakfast was poor and i was told unless I book every day then the price goes from EUR 25 to EUR34. I did not like the fact they took all the tables out of action on the Thursday at the Pool Bar. Great views from the pool deck.  Not sure I will stay again.
I asked for a room with a view and still waiting for the call back. There are no English speaking  channels on the TV.",3,2022,06,17
12,Great hotel to stay in Barcelona ,"High quality hotel with great hospitality, breakfast, and hotel interior design. You feel previlege and warm welcome with staff great hospitality. Rooms are well kept, clean and big with comfortable bed. Got a few  nice restaurants within the hotel and that itself is convenient to hotel guest. Also the hotel is well located and easily accessible to nearest metro. ",5,2022,06,14
12,Awesome experience. Bruno is great!!,"Bruno the Club Manager was fantastic. From the day we arrived through our checkout process he was extremely professional. Not only did he explain our amenities available to us, but he made sure our experience was above and beyond! I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,06,07
12,Business Travel Envy,"Had the opportunity to stay in this hotel while on business. I wish it had been for a family trip! I know very little about Barcelona, but the location seemed great. It was a short drive to the convention center and about 20 minutes to the airport. We were also able to find plenty of restaurants within walking distance. 
The room itself was well appointed. Bonus points for having USB ports conveniently located around the room, which allowed me to charge my electronics without overtaxing my limited power adapters. 
The free breakfast downstairs offered a variety of foods. There's also a very nice bar attached to the lobby, as well as a rooftop bar that serves food and provides beautiful views of the city. 
What really sets this hotel apart, however, is the service. My (very) limited Spanish was not a problem. If you want to become a great concierge, just shadow Marc for a few days. He is the best! Not only did he make us reservations at a restaurant that served the best paella I've ever eaten, but he scheduled a COVID-19 test at the hotel for me (required to come back to the U.S.).",5,2022,06,05
12,"Excellent Property, Helpful Staff","I have stayed here in several of its guises over the last 30 years: Fira Palace; Crowne Plaza and now Intercontinental. Each guise had a different character, but were excellent in their own way. My recent stay since it has been redurbished and switched to an Intercontinental showcased the hotels hospitality (Bruno in reception was very helpful). Our room was large, bright and well furbished. Location on Montjuc is fine with easy access to teh Centre and nice walks around Montjuc. The rooftop bar offers very nice views cross tehrooftops.",5,2022,06,04
12,"Brilliant stay, even more brilliant concierge!","Had a great time staying at the IC Barcelona during the F1 Spanish GP weekend for 5 nights. Rooms were great, and really quiet along with a lovely view from the rooftop bar. We arrived late into the evening, and had an early flight on the Monday post race, and both times we were greeted with friendly, welcoming front desk staff despite it being 4am!

One thing I HAVE to call out is the willingness of the concierge to help when I realised I had left my Apple AirPods Pro in my hotel room post check out. After a frantic phone call straight to the reception, the team at IC Barcelona located the earphones and offered to send in a taxi, but unfortunately I had JUST gone through security so this was not an option. Here I am, 5 business days later reunited with my earphones through UPS - efficient, helpful, and would stay there again in a heart beat. Thank you concierge at IC for saving me the pain of an insurance claim!",5,2022,05,31
12,Excellent property; very helpful staff,"We stayed at this property for 5 nights while attending the BIR conference last week. The property has been recently renovated and had several places of interest like Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya - MNAC, The Magic Fountain, Parc de Montjuic & Plaça d'Espanya within a walking distance.
The staff is very helpful and courteous. I would especially like to mention Annie Nicolau who was very helpful with our booking.
The room size is great and had all the facilities one would ask for.
There is a bar on the ground floor and another open bar on the roof-top.
Overall, we had a great experience and I would highly recommend this property!",5,2022,05,29
12,Amazing property with excellent staff,"Stayed here pre-cruise for my Mum's birthday.  Had emailed hotel about twin room and room service and got a lovely prompt reply.
Hotel is beautiful, it's so stunning and rooms are so nicely done.
Check in staff were lovely and wished my mum a happy birthday.  Breakfast the next morning was really good with a good spread of food available.
Only downside was the noise at night from the rooftop pool, tbf it seemed to be one group screaming at each other and singing.  But if you're a light sleeper I'd ask for a room away from that area.
Overall a lovely hotel, very 5 star atmosphere with the most wonderful staff!",5,2022,05,16
12,We love this hotel,"We stayed 3 days at InterContinental Barcelona, which was renovated in 2021. The room was big with a lot of lights and nice view of Monjuic Notional Palace. Front desk staff were very helpful and offered good recommendations on restaurants nearby. The lunch at Arrel was amazing.",5,2022,05,12
12,Football match Barcelona-Malaga.,"We stayed three nights at the hotel, Bruno gave his best to give us a great experience and he succeeded. The hotel looks amazing and clean, the stuff were very friendly and attentive, we will certainly be coming back and recommend to our family and friends.",4,2022,05,04
12,"Excellent service, quit rooms","We visited Barcelona on a citytrip in late February. The welcome in the hotel was warm and friendly. We were granted with an upgrade to a suite. The rooms including the bathroom  were spacious, quite, cosy and clean. Even the weather wasn't very fine the roof terrace was accessible, only the bar was closed. From there you have a stunning view above the whole city. The breakfast in the hotel was rich and worth every cent.",5,2022,05,03
12,My go-to hotel in Barcelona,"It's not the first time I visit this hotel and we love it. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The checkin was easy and the expedited checkout early morning was fast and they prepared some to-go breakfast for us. Make sure you try their buffet breakfast, it's delicious and high quality. The rooms are super spacious and comfortable. You can find everything you need in there. The rooftop is out of this world with an excellent view and ambience. Ideal for friends, family, couples and even for solo travelers. The lobby is very glamorous and the bar/lounge is perfect for waiting, having a drink, reading a book, looking at the passerby, or just relaxing. I almost finished my review without mentioning the location. Its location is very good. Walking distance to Montjuïc, Plaça d'Espanya, and many other city highlights. Bus stations nearby and taxi's available at the hotel (also there's a station nearby for the HopOn-HopOff buses). Also not too far away from the airport nor the Seaport (15 minutes approximately)",5,2022,04,26
12,Beautiful and comfortable stay,"I stayed with my family and friends, we took several rooms that were absolutely beautiful. Every detail in the hotel is modern and superb. Everything looks clean and neat. It has an amazing roof top, and also a nice lounge where you can chill out and have a drink after walking the city. The breakfast was delicious, a nice selection of cheese, ham , sausages, fruits, cereals, drinks and many more options, delicious fresh bread,  and many delicatessen stuff as well, too many options to remember them all. The staff was very nice since we checked in, the lady on the lounge was very kind and the service in general was great. We had to leave very early the last day to the airport and they prepared a pic nic breakfast for us, that was an outstanding detail. Will go back definitely.",5,2022,04,26
12,Outstanding,"Everything we wanted and more! 5 star hotel and service - luxury retreat in one of the best cities in the world. Highlights - the spa, huge bed and tv, overall interior design and mega staff. We will be back !!!!",5,2022,04,23
12,The perfect city break!,"What a stay! This hotel is second to none in our opinion. The staff are super friendly, knowledgable and attentive, nothing is too much trouble. The food and drinks in the Quirat restaurant, Gebre and rooftop bars were outstanding.  The views from the rooftop bar are breathtaking, encompassing the the entire panorama of the Barcelona skyline including- Tibidabo, Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar, The Gothic Cathedral, Colon, Mapfre towers, the beach, Montjuic, the list goes on. Don’t hesitate to choose here as the base for your city visit, whether it be for business, or as in our case, an absolute pleasure. 10/10",5,2022,04,19
12,Intercontinental Hotel but without the Intercontinental Service/Standard,"We spent 3 nights with my boyfriend in the Intercontinental Barcelona and I a bit perplex. 
You need to understand that you are now an Intercontinental Hotel and no more a Crowne Plaza Hotel.
As an Ambassador Member, I was supposed to be upgraded but it seems that the Management forget this...In the letter I've got (not a personal letter signed as in the other Intercontinentals) you mensionned that the Upgrade is subject to the availibility, but please check the Amabassor Member Benefists...This is clearly mentionned that this is a GUARENTEED UPGRADE !!!
Other thing, breakfast is really good but the staff is not fully operational, and they need some more training...the 173 team also  need training !
Hopfully the hotel is amazing, this is why I put 3 stars on 5. 
I sent 2 emails before arrivals and never got a reply from the front office team...
Anyway, not sure to return again 
To the manager, you are getting my personnal email address so you can contact me if you want !
Room 636 from April 15-18th 2022",3,2022,04,19
12,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"Stayed here from 10th - 14th April. Arrived late and was greeted by Bruno on reception, who was very friendly and helpful.  Had a drink at the stunning bar and chatted to the friendly staff. Our bedroom was gorgeous, the biggest we've had and we've stayed in a lot of Hotels. The hot water was temperamental, leave it to run for a long time to get hot water. The hotel breakfast was varied, lots of choice but only used it once. Eat dinner at the hotel, which was nice, the chocolate praline bomb was delicious. In my opinion, the menu is limited and we did prefer to eat out. Tried different cocktails and watching them being made was often a 'show'. Jordi was great at making them. Steven and Guillermo were great too, very helpful and friendly. All the staff here are lovely and very friendly. We used the spa pool as the rooftop pool/restaurant was closed (it opened on the 14th April). Please be aware there is a charge for using this but we weren't informed until we saw it on our bill. After speaking to a Manager, our charge was removed. Overall, a wonderful stay. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2022,04,15
12,"Wonderful staff, food and rooms","I can say with 100% honesty that this hotel has the nicest staff that I have ever encountered in a hotel. I really hate mentioning names as quite honestly every single person in the hotel is so genuine, amazing and wants to care for the guest and their needs. The bar is outstanding and the cocktails and mocktails are wonderful, we ate twice in the restaurant and ordered room service which were all 5*. The concierge were so helpful and eager to help.  We loved every moment and it was such a special experience.",5,2022,03,18
12,Celebration over long weekend,"I’ve just checked out from Intercontinental hotel in Barcelona after a 5 night stay to celebrate a birthday! 
The hotel is fairly new and all the rooms and amenities are top notch! 
Small things like being able to ‘cast’ your favorite movie to the 50” is great for the kids. 
I had booked a room with club lounge access which meant that you get the full breakfast next to the lobby. They had a great cold and hot buffet and  I recommend the eggs Benedict!
This is also where they serve cava or other beverages, small sandwiches, desserts and snacks! Great quality food and beverages which meant that we stopped by every evening before going out to eat!
My wife and I also enjoyed the SPA which is small but top notch with for example the different saunas, icy mini plunge pool, 6 or 7 stations in the pool etc.",5,2022,03,15
12,Good size room with excellent service,"Had a very pleasant stay at intercontinental Barcelona, staff were friendly and helpful, newly renovated room with exceptional cleanliness. The bed is very comfy, it will be better if they have firm/neck support pillows. The hotel concierge is excellent, highly recommend to utilise this service.",5,2022,02,23
12,"Functional, great rooftop bar but a bit ropey","I stayed at this hotel for a business event in February 2022. The hotel itself is very functional, with good enough rooms and a generous dining/conferencing space, by European city standards. 

The rooftop bar is outstanding, though it doesn’t actually have service (at least not when I was there) so you either bring something up form downstairs or grab some of the coffee provided for free up there.

Some of the service was pretty bad, in terms of being slow or non-existent, but maybe like a lot of hotels they were running low staffing rates coming out of covid. 

Having said that, the staff themselves were friendly and fun to talk to.",3,2022,02,20
12,First choice in Barcelona,"The recent refurbishment and upgrade with excellent quality materials has converted the hotel to a classy and elegant 5 star level, with all facilities. It is a large convention Hotel with a very good location - close to Sants train station and not far from the airport, near Plaza España and two metro stations, yet all public areas are very compact, cosy and easily accessible. The service is exceptional. Professional, welcoming, empathetic, recognizing  guests and consistent greeting with last name. If it was not for the masks, you could see many smiles! Just to mention a few names, Julian, Jaume, Sandra, Montse...the list is too long, all of them are magnificent hosts, truly enjoying their work. The gastronomy is very interesting, starting with breakfast, and finishing with a drink in the bar with a selection of surprising cocktails. No need to look for another hotel in Barcelona",5,2022,01,09
12,Good infrastructure but some issues with service - otherwise a beautiful hotel.,"The hotel looks very nice after the renovation. I think it was closed for more than a year. My room had a good size and very comfortable. Everything was there. 
Unfortunately I had a few points which made me to give only 4*. After arrival in the room I had to call 3 times maintenance - Coffee machine was not working, TV and phone as well. There is an iron, but not a steam iron. What really did upset me - there is a charge of Euro 40 for using the Sauna/Steam. Was not mentioned in the confirmation nor on the web page. Disappointing for a 5* hotel. Also no drink menu in the bar - you just have to guess what they offer and the prices. They have a big choice and very nice selection of Scottish Whiskies. All this can happen and I would not mind, but the reaction to it was not professional. I had the feeling they did not really care.",4,2021,12,08
12,Perfection,"We were thrilled to stay at the newly renovated Intercontinental Barcelona. Everything was exquisite and much attention to detail. The bartender’s drinks were works of art. Outstanding service at the door, check-in and restaurant. The rooftop was closed during our stay but it looked fabulous.",5,2021,11,28
12,Amazing Stay!,"A fantastic and truly memorable stay.

The hotel has recently had a full rebrand and refurbishment from a Crowne Plaza to an Intercontinental (still part of IHG) and is truly stunning, so much thought has been put into the design/decor and all the little details that it all adds up and make it a truly memorable experience.

The hotel is in a quiet leafy area with minimal traffic noise.

Having stayed in room 406, the room is newly refurbed also decorated very tastefully, in modern clean colours and looks great, there are handy features such as aircon and lots of plug sockets and USB, on both side of the bed for charging devices which is a great touch and a fully stocked mini fridge and tea/coffee making facilities.

As the hotel is so new, the main thing to call out is how great the bed was, completely comfortable and just right, a great sleep was had and wished this could have been taken home!

The hotel has a fantastic and well equipped spa area, with a full water circuit consisting of waterbeds, full pool, sauna steamroom etc and even though some features weren’t available on the day as it was so new, I was assured these would be operational as soon as possible but this didn’t distract from a thoroughly enjoyable experience!

Restaurant has stunning decor, food was great for both dinner and breakfast and a wide selection catering for everyone.

A few teething issues in the room as so new this is to be expected in a hotel that’s been open only a few days but a call out to the Fantastic staff who went above and beyond to make it a great stay - listened to my feedback and put steps in place to address it and everyone deserves the recognition from the porters who took the luggage to the room, to reception and concierge who took onboard the feedback and went the extra mile to make sure that everything was taken care of - truly a memorable experience and will definitely be staying again!",5,2021,10,21
12,"stayed here on 3 separate ocassions. you are treated like family, and the club lounge is exceptionall","i absolutely love barcelona. its sights, restaurants people etc. i could retire there in a heartbeat if i spoke spanish. on my first visit we hired a cab to visit the monestery  on our 2nd visit we hired a limo to just take us around the entire city, but always came back in time for happy hour",5,2020,04,13
12,Light sleeper alert - window rattles when windy - but there's a fix,"I'm a light sleeper and irregular noises from within a room wake me up.  My room had one in particular - the window rattled.  It was windy when I visited Barcelona and the wind caused the window to rattle in its tracks.  Unfortunately I didn't figure out the fix until the morning of my one night stay.  The solution - fold up hotel notepad paper and cram it between the track and the rear of the window where it rattled.  Obvious in retrospect, but disappointing I had to figure it out and deal with it.  

It didn't help that my room was next to the maid service, which went into full activity at around 8 am when I was trying get some extra shut-eye.  

The room and beds are very comfortable, and it's thoughtful how they separate the bathroom and main corridor with a small entry way.  Two benefits: isolation from corridor noise and smell barrier from the bathroom.  To me, Barcelona is notorious for sewer smell that seems to percolate up from every drain in every bathroom everywhere.  I've visited Barcelona many times over the last twenty years, and that hasn't changed.",3,2020,03,17
12,Lovely hotel,"Spent a couple of days recently in this lovely hotel. Very friendly check in, rooms are very spacious, we had twin rooms, beds are super comfortable. We ate in the restaurant and had breakfast, the food and attention was excellent. We had a drink in the club lounge, and we were looked after so well by Bruno, he was very attentive and really personalised our visit to the CP Barcelona. Hotel is in a great location, number of sites on your door step, the musical fountains, Mount juic and it’s cable car. It’s a couple mins from Espanya metro and you can get the 46 bus to / from the airport from place d’espanya. Also managed a swim in the pool and some well needed rays on the roof top terrace. ",5,2020,03,13
12,The best hotel stay we have EVER had,This was the best hotel we have ever stayed.  We have stayed in many hotels in different countries and this was hands down the best experience.  The staff was incredible.  Nothing left undone.   We were taken up to the Club room right away and given a map of the city with all of the must sees pointed out. The HR rep running the club room was so sweet and helpful.  The room was amazing....spacious...cleaned spotless daily and amenities were incomparable.   Would HIGHLY recommend!  Luxurious stay!!!!,5,2020,03,04
12,Perfect city break!,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Barcelona for our 5 night city break. The staff were always very attentive and made our stay feel very welcoming. Being a member of IHG my room was automatically upgraded to an executive suite which was very big and had all the amenities that we required. On our last day we visited the on site spa which we found very relaxing and very reasonably priced. We never ate in the restaurant as we preferred to eat out when visiting a new city but we did have a drink in the bar which was again manned by attentive members of staff. There is a running station just by the main entrance which I have not seen before but thought was a great idea with free bottles of water, local running routes of varying distances and towels etc for guests at the hotel to use. There is a Metro station about a 5 minute walk from the hotel which is extremely easy to use and very cheap so you can get around the city very easily. Also I recommend the restaurant ‘Taps’ which is just across the road from the hotel for a great tapas meal, we went there on our first night as we didn’t arrive until around 21:00 and just wanted somewhere close and this place was perfect and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza and should I visit Barcelona again I would stay here again myself. ",5,2020,02,23
12,Average ,"I had to go for a business trip to Barcelona. The hotel was already booked. First appearance was really sophisticated and clean. It was clean outside the bath which really had yellow and brown dirt that you always see in these travel programs on tv. The rest of the room was pretty good, so presumably an omission. 
The meals (buffets) were really average not real good, never distasteful. The strangest course choice was the crème brûlée’s without burned sugar on top. 
",3,2020,02,12
12,Repeat Visits,"Repeat couple of visits to this property. Still excellent since my last visit a few years ago. Only slight negative - one of the rooms I stayed in had stains on carpets near the mini-bar/tea coffee making facilities, presumably from stains. However, this is outweighed by the positives. The rooms are double the size of most others in Barcelona and have large comfortable beds and even reclining chairs. The pool and bar on the roof terrace were closed when I visited due to the season (February) but I still enjoyed the great view. The breakfast is good. The hotel is an easy walk to the very pleasant Montjuic area.",5,2020,02,10
12,Best experience ever.,"An amazing hotel, the room was incredible good, the breakfast in the morning has a lot of variety, even asian breakfast. The check in was good, Javier is really polite and helped us with some places where to go. I am really impressed with the hotel and service. The staff at the breakfast were amazing as well. I have nothing bad to say. Was one of the best experiences in my life. Barcelona is a place that i will back always, and of course stay at the Crowne plaza!! Thank you guys for making this so magic!",5,2020,01,25
12,Superb,"Enjoyed a one night stay at this exceptional hotel. Right from the start the receptionist Maurico was friendly, attentive and very welcoming. He also recommended a great tapas restaurant a few minutes from the hotel.

The room was exceptionally clean and large with great bed linen and comfy bed. The bathroom was even more of a surprise as it was modern and fresh in decor with great toiletries.

Easily compares to five star hotels on the room and service. Great choice for a stay.",5,2020,01,17
12,"Excellent Hotel, good use of the free night certificate from credit card","We chose this hotel within the IHG chain due to the close proximity to the cruise terminal.  Front desk staff was very friendly and patient in providing information on local attractions.  Spire members can access the club lounge for drinks, evening snacks and an excellent full breakfast.  Will definitely consider this hotel when returning to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,12
12,"Amazing stay . great hotel , excellent location","we spent New Year here. Amazing hotel in city centre, close to the NYE Firework Display, in easy walking distance of the beach , Las Ramblas and all tourist attractions,
Hotel clean comfortable and staff friendly and efficient",5,2020,01,06
12,Awesome hospitality by Javier!,"Marvellous, 5 star as Javier made my day with his first class service. He made whatever possible to please the guest. Thumbs up for Javier and the hotel for excellent service and experience! Highly recommended hotel at Barcelona anytime..:)",5,2019,11,25
12,Nice hotel,"A really nice hotel, comfortable clean rooms, friendly and helpful reception staff. But why oh why (and it is hotels everywhere that do this) when they have signs saying help the environment by not hanging up your towels and we won't change them or put this sign on the door and house keeping will leave your room alone today do they totally ignore these?",4,2019,11,22
12,A little drawback,"I stayed at Crown Plaza Barcelona Fira Centre for three nights. The hotel is relatively new, very clean, spacious and centrally located. Fairly convenient to the places that I wanted to go. Unfortunately, there were two drawbacks which forced me to give it a 3 star instead of a 4.5 star. The hotel has only one restaurant and it is open for breakfast until 10:30 AM. It is NOT open for lunch, which is a big surprise to me. How can a 4 star hotel in central Barcelona not open for lunch? That is beyond my understanding. Then, it is not open for dinner until 7:30 PM! Incredible indeed! That is very inconvenient for the tourists. The second drawback is the water drainage in the shower room. The water drained very slowly and I was essentially standing in a big pool of water in the shower. I reported this to the front desk and they promised to fix the problem. That evening, it turned out to be only marginally better. I reported it again and I was told that it would be ""fixed"". Unfortunately, the water drainage remained very slow. The pool of water was still there when I had my shower. By the time I checked out, the problem remained unresolved. I am highly suspicious that the problem is more complicated than just a few pieces of hair in the drainage pipes in the hotel room. That is unfortunate for a hotel that should have earned higher marks from me.",3,2019,11,18
12,Nice and great staff,"I was here for 3 nights. It was a fantastic stay. It’s about 10 min from the city center but still nearby great sight seeing places. 
A starbucks and a shopping mall is just around the corner. 

The breakfast buffet is perfect. The gym is clean and nice and I spend time in the wellness too which was really good. 
I would come back again. ",5,2019,11,18
12,"Central location, full comfort","Hotel located walking distance from Plaza d'Espana and from Barcelona Arena, Has its own parking and is not complicated to reach by car from airport. Rooms are spacious, with nice bathroom inclusive separated shower and WC. Hotel has a large SPA. The restaurant offers a large variety at Breakfast and serves very nice food for dinner (not so much traditionnal spanish but very nice). I would go there again happily",4,2019,11,17
12,Amazing,"Wow!!! Amazing service. Well located. Huge room. They make us feel like they are happy to have us as customers. We were there during manifestations and they have offered us to drive us early in the morning to airport to avoid manifestation. The lounge was perfect. Breakfast was good, healthy, fresh. I highly recommend this hotel! Was 100!times better then intercontinental istanbul ( we were there the month) wow a different. Here they know what is customer service and they know how to make your stays enjoyable. Next time in Barcelona, we will return for sure.",5,2019,11,14
12,Strategic Location and Wonderful Stay,"I had a wonderful time, the hotel is a walking distance to Montjuic dancing fountain, the room was spacious and had nice view as I got upgraded. The bathroom had a bidet which is rare in Europe yet very important for us who’s used to it. Friendly and welcoming staff.  nice breakfast as well. The only disadvantage is that windows are small. It’s not the hotel for you if you prefer big view of the city",5,2019,11,13
12,First time in Barcelona ,"Great hotel.  Convenient location away from the noise of the gothic quarter.  Very clean, good gym, comfortable beds. Didn't even realize there was a conference going on. Cabs always outside to hop in. A good walk to La Rambla. A 5 minute walk to the subway at Plaza Espana. ",5,2019,11,04
12,"Stunning hotel, great location, awesome Exec Lounge","We were here for 3 days before a Med Cruise (26-Jul to 29-Jul). Really good find, as the Fira area is lovely, and far enough away from the madness of the Ramblas to be quiet, but great access to the Metro and the lovely Mont Juic.
The exec lounge made this place for us though, as it was really good. Great and friendly staff, and the little lady who runs the breakfast room seemingly alone is a hard working marvel.
Only slight niggle was a loud party of female Brits constantly in the Exec lounge during our stay, drinking heavily and being generally loud! One of them was friends with or related to a member of staff, but that member of staff made no attempt to quieten them down or preserve the ambience for the rest of us. Pretty poor that given how much we paid to be there, and a bit embarrasing to see Brits abroad acting boorishly (again).
But still, a fabulous hotel, definitely one of our favourites. Will defo stay there again.",4,2019,11,02
12,Greedy customer service towards a repeated customer,"First of all me and my friend are repeated customers, having been guests of this hotel at least 2-3 times already. Every time we were there, everything was ok and the service was excellent. HOWEVER it is the last booking we did (Oct 25-28) that brought us the ugliest experience we never thought possible within Crowne Plaza chain. 
A couple of weeks ago  in early September we booked two rooms + breakfast at this hotel, because we also purchased tickets for El Clasico. The football game was initially  scheduled for October 26, but because of the recent protests and instability in Barcelona, one week before that date, the Spanish Football Federation cancelled the game. Instead they scheduled the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid on December 18, date which was totally unacceptable for us because of many reasons. Because of the severity of the situation, we decided to cancel our trip to Barcelona immediately and ask for a refund of our money paid in advance, since it was not our fault that the events in Barcelona forced the game to be cancelled and rescheduled in December. We managed to get refunds from the stadium tickets and also the airline tickets. BUT the Crowne Plaza Fira Center refused to reimburse us totally or even partially the cost for the two rooms + breakfast, or even rebook our two rooms for another time. Their approach didn't provide any solutions whatsoever, nothing we requested was acceptable to them. 
This attitude towards us from a hotel with such high standards and reputation was a total shock to us. We have been guests to Crowne Plaza chain both in Europe and North America, but we've never experienced anything like that. We still hope that someone in the Management of the hotel will take a look at our situation and come with a decent solution. OTHERWISE this can happen to any other guests, so beware...",1,2019,10,31
12,Great accomodations and location,This hotel is located just down the street from the Magic Fountain and city center.  The views from the roof top show off the city well.  The glass walled pool is a really cool feature.  Room was very clean and bed was extremely comfortable.  Staff were very pleasant.,5,2019,10,24
12,Nice business hotel,This hotel located in the proximity of the “old” Fira and the Plaza espanyol caters to the need of business travellers. I was given a suite at the 3rd floor and having that gave me access to the club lounge. This is a relaxing area with club chairs and offers some snacks and drinks. The adjacent room serves as breakfast room. The bedroom (suite) is large and comes with a large balcony. The glass panels are double which is absolutely needed to keep the street noise out. Two tv sets ( did not use them) and a sizable bathroom. Service was forthcoming. ,5,2019,10,23
12,Nice hotel,"Nice and clean hotel, the staff are happy to help too, location is good not far from train station,shops and restaurants. easy links to other parts of the city. We took the hop on hop off bus .would definitely recommend.",5,2019,10,05
12,Pricey but Nice Hotel,"Bedroom for our family of 3 at €320 per night seems to be pricey while I booked this hotel. But After I checked into Crowne Plaza, I soon found what I paid for. Nice pool lounge bar overlook Barcelona. Spacey room with separated shower, bath tub and toilet. Quiet location at busy city. Close to subway station, small market as well as resturants. Being an IHG Elite, free drinks at bar after sightseeing is anothe extra.",4,2019,09,26
12,Suited us well for an overnight stay,"This was a post cruise stay so we arrived by taxi quite early in the morning and were allocated a club room (as booked) quickly, always a bonus.It was about a 15 minute trip from the port in morning traffic. As others have mentioned the room was large by local standards, renovated and had a nice bathroom (walk-in shower) with big fluffy towels.
The Magic Fountain is close and so is Plaza España which seemed to be a busy and well connected area.The area directly around the hotel had a local feel and we ate in a neighbourhood tapas bar (Taps).
It was any easy ride to the airport by taxi the next morning. I have been to Barcelona before and seen all the major sites so this off centre location was fine for this stay but it would require a fair bit of moving around the city if this was your sightseeing base. The metro is notorious for pick packets so I am not sure I would be happy relying on public transport.
The club lounge was nice, there was free flowing real champagne - Moët all day, a good breakfast selection, afternoon snacks and a long happy hour.
Overall a solid choice that ticked all the boxes on this quick visit to Barcelona.",4,2019,09,21
12,Hats off!,"Hands down the best client service ever experienced!  Kudos to the reception and club lounge staff.  We arrived at the hotel early in the morning, right after our cruise docked.  The hotel was quite busy and our room was obviously not ready yet but the reception staff immediately took care of our bags and set us up in the club lounge for breakfast.  Shortly after we were advised our room was ready.  The room was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom very well-appointed. The hotel location is also quite convenient, just a short walk to the beautiful Mountjuic park and a 5 mins taxi ride to the main downtown tourist attractions.  We didn’t try the restaurant but breakfast in the club lounge was great, with a nice variety of food and drinks and fantastic service.",5,2019,09,19
12,"Excellent hotel, spa and club lounge","It's hard to fault this hotel!  My partner is an IHG Ambassador and we were upgraded to a suite on a points booking, and purchased club lounge access for 30EUR pppn, which was excellent value, as it included a very good breakfast (for a lounge), canapés for lunch and dinner, and soft and alcoholic drinks through the whole day (including Moet champagne).  Club lounge staff were are excellent.  

The room was excellent, with very effective air con, little noise, and very comfy bed.  

We visited the spa, which is 19EUR (best to book in advance) for IHG members, and well worth it.  It's one of the best hotel spas I've experienced, with an amazing hydrotherapy pool, plunge pool and bucket shower as well as sauna and steam. 

We didn't use the hotel restaurant, because Taps bar is a few metres away, with excellent and reasonably priced food and drink, with very friendly service and English speaking staff and English menus!  We were there every night!

The hotel is well located, 10 mins walk from two metro stations, allowing easy access to the city. 

I'd definitely return if I were in Barcelona again.",5,2019,09,15
12,Very nice hotel.,We arrived in Barcelona one day before our cruise and stayed at the Crown Plaza Fira Center. The location was very near many of the city attractions & nice places to eat. The rooms were very morden & clean. The staff was very polite & friendly.,5,2019,09,10
12,"Good location, great hotel and staff","My husband and I arrived at the hotel on September 5, 2019 at about 8am, knowing that we were unlikely to get a room that early. Thankfully, we were fortunate to be greeted by David L at the front desk, who is an outstanding ambassador for the hotel. Not only did he make us feel incredibly welcome, he did everything to get me and my husband a room even though the hotel was operating that night at full capacity. We were lucky to get a lovely room on the second floor (room 226) that has  a dining/working area, plenty of seating, a separate bedroom and a large, very well-equipped bathroom. Everything about our visit at this lovely property was excellent. David took the time to provide me with a map and point out some of the important areas to visit. He informed me about the services and encouraged us to use the hotel bar/pool area, which really is lovely. The staff on the top floor are also excellent, and we visited it twice. There's no doubt that we will stay at another Crowne Plaza as they do things right, including slippers, robes, coffee, water, and their towels were plush and plentiful. I would absolutely recommend this hotel without reservation.",5,2019,09,09
12,Great location. ,"Flew into Barcelona for a few days of sight seeing! Great hotel with brilliant tourist attractions within walking distance and a short Cab ride further into town! Always Taxis outside and only €10 or so Euros down to The Beach/ Las Ramblas. €25/30 to the Airport 

We walked to the Magic Fountains, The Bull ring  shopping Center and had Dinner up on the Top terrace of the Bullring.

We didn’t go to the restaurants here at the hotel but did have snacks on the roof. Pool isn’t too big and cold but done the job. Plus side the bar is open until 1am so nice to go up for a night cap after a night further into the city.

Nice size rooms, clean and tidy with no issues at all with the hotel. 

Would I stay again, no because I like to try different. Would I recommend? Yes definitely. ",4,2019,09,08
12,Good if not in centre of town,"Pros. Lovely hotel, 
massive room, 
stunning rooftop (one of best in city), 
Very close to Olympic stadium 
Very close to magic 

Cons. A 20 minute bus ride to the beach...not walkable with beach stuff....subway is good bud veeeery hot
Far out from city centre.

The hotel is lovely though very expensive for any extras. The spa / indoor pool is €15 each to enter. Which left us disappointed. Never been charged to use a hotel pool before.
The rooftop pool however is free, but if you aren’t on the rooftop by 10am then forget getting a sunbed for the rest of the day. The do suffer from the scourge of a large family reserving all the beds for the rest of the family who aren’t immediately there then trickle in anytime before lunch.

The fountains nearby are amazing...as is the bullring shopping/restaurant area.

The hotel business centre left me massively confused....a huge range of brand new iMacs but someone decided to save money and buy cheap PC keyboards for all of them!!! And to make matters worse they weren’t set up....

The room is massive possibly the largest I’ve ever had in a hotel.

Make sure you buy the week long travel pass immediately on arrival...all travel is then free on busses and tubes.

",4,2019,09,06
12,Good choice,"First time in Barcelona and chose this hotel as it looked to be in a good location for getting to various places. We weren’t disappointed - close to Montjuic fountains and the Olympic stadium and easy access to transport. 
We used hop on hop off tour bus and the the local transport bus to go further afield; €10 buys 10 journeys on either bus or metro.
Hotel rooms were spacious and well equipped. Daily room cleaning service excellent and reception staff were very helpful.
Rooftop pool and bar area provided welcome relaxation after a day sightseeing. Pool is small but only to be expected in a city centre hotel. 
Only criticism is the price of the drinks in the rooftop bar; especially considering we found food and drink prices very reasonable throughout the city.",4,2019,09,03
12,BEST HOTEL EVER VISITED,"I'm an IHG Spire Elite member that does frequent traveling, and I have to rate this Crowne Plaza Barcelona hotel as the very best I ever visited!!!  My wife, sister in-law, and I were on vacation on 8/14/19 and 8/15/19 prior to a cruise and we were so happy that we picked this hotel.  They upgraded our 2 rooms to a suite and an adjoining deluxe room.  We arrived early from the United States, so they escorted us to their VIP Club Lounge that included unlimited free drinks (including hard liquor, wine, and beer) plus hors d'oeuvres.  Being a Spire Elite member, we were allowed to visit the VIP Club Lounge any time it was open.  It closes at 11pm.  The suite had a large bedroom, large living room, and large bathroom along with a great view overlooking Barcelona.  The rooftop restaurant, lounge, and pool were ideal.  The workout facility served its purpose.  The location is near the city center.  We would highly recommend this Crowne Plaza Barcelona hotel, and as mentioned, I rate it as the best hotel I have ever stayed in because of the accommodations and superb service.  Tom O.",5,2019,09,03
12,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel to stay at in Barcelona, the rooms are great and the food is awesome. Staff are really friendly and if you fancy a drink in the evening pop up to the roof/173 bar where you will find great views of Barcelona, also look out for two barmen called Francisco and Malek, really professional but also really made us feel welcome.",5,2019,09,01
12,Lovely hotel,Had a fantastic time in Crowne Plaza. Staff are all very friendly and accommodating. In particular Omar was a great help to us when we arrived. He went through everything with us and was massive help. We would definitely return to the Crowne Plaza. ,4,2019,09,01
12,Would not recommend....,"I stayed most of IHG properties and It was the first time staying at Crown Plaza. As the hotel states that it’s a business hotel, it would be ok for quick one night stay but I would not recommend this hotel for more than that. Hotel staff’s attitude to guests was nothing better than Holiday Inn, the breakfast buffet was like leftover foods, and the most of snacks at the Executive Lounge were reheated unhealthy frozen food. I also had a water drain problem in both bathroom sink and bathtub.",2,2019,08,08
12,Fantastic hotel,"Really nice hotel, great executive lounge, fantastic staff, special thanks to Jean at the reception desk who went out of his way to make our stay super special. 
We totally recommend this hotel. Excellent.",5,2019,08,08
12,"Good Hotel, TERRIBLE Customer Service","This hotel is just okay, nothing great to highlight. I would say it’s in a good location, especially if you have business nearby. It’s very walkable to places to eat and the metro about 10 minutes away on foot.

Customer service is not their strong point, to put it mildly. We arrived early so had to wait for a room, which was fine, understandable. But the lack of communication wasn’t. We were told 20 minutes at first, then 40 additional, then it was ‘ready’ and she would be right over to give us our keys. We waited over two hours for a room, which I figured was because we were being upgraded (for being platinum). Nope, that’s just how it is for everyone.

Speaking of which, Platinum elite recognition is very poor. No upgraded room, no priority for anything, and about the only thing they highlighted over and over again was late check out, which we didn’t need.

Let’s highlight just how bad the customer service is here. When I checked in, it was noted over and over again each night of the stay was on a separate booking (2 total). No problem I was told. We went sightseeing the next day from 7:30am to 3:00pm (it was HOT outside), and when we arrived back to the hotel, our room hadn’t been cleaned yet. Mildly annoyed, I called the front desk and was told they would ‘prioritize’ our room. I asked how long and was told it would be next and maybe 40 minutes to 1 hour. Fine, we went up to the pool deck for a drink and a snack. 

The pool deck is actually the highlight of this hotel, very tastefully laid out and decorated, but it was HOT out. Now the STAFF, WOW, WOW, WOW! Talk about great customer service by the waiters/bartenders! THEY should be the service ambassadors for this hotel, not who is currently manning the front desk. No request was too much and they made a conscience effort to make sure we were happy with what we ordered. Awesome staff!

Now, an hour passes and we go down to our room, and of course it has not been touched. Still. So I was not pleased at this point, call back down to the front desk, (same woman answers as before) and she could not have been less interested. She suggested we go to the rooftop bar and wait while she ‘prioritized’ our room for cleaning AGAIN. I explained to her that we just got back from there, that she told us it would be prioritized an hour ago, and it was insanely hot outside. She repeated that she would ‘prioritize’ our room again, sorry for the inconvenience. Mind you it was 4pm by this point. 

The same front desk woman called back a few minutes later and said our stay was on two bookings so housekeeping thought we were checking out. Hello? This was pointed out over and over and over again at check in, it was not a secret nor a surprise to anyone. 

So they screwed up badly, and were even worse at the service recovery. When stuff like this happens, it’s not the issue itself, it’s how it’s responded to by the staff. And in that regard, it was horrendous. No service recovery whatsoever, be it buying us a meal, giving us club access while we waited, a drink at the bar, NOTHING but an empty apology.

Needless to say, I will be staying elsewhere next time I’m in Barcelona.",2,2019,08,07
12,Beautiful hotel,"My friend and I absolutely loved staying at the Plaza in Barcelona. The staff were welcoming and very helpful, our room was clean and filled with lots of little extras like pillow spray and chocolates. The pool and bar area were outstanding and the cocktails were delicious. The hotel is near to the metro which made travelling into the city easy. We can’t wait to come back and stay again!!",5,2019,08,07
12,Extremely disappointed in accommodations and managerial customer service,"I checked into the hotel with my wife and 2 sons on Sat 27 Jul 2019 for a 1 night pre-cruise stay. We opened the door to our ""King Bed With Sofa Bed"" room and was assaulted by a sewage smell so intense that my wife would not even let the kids into the room. The front desk sent up a maintenance man who poured a liquid deodorizer into the toilet and bathtub which of course did not resolve the issue of the already present smell in the room. He went down to the front desk to have them place us in a 2nd room. The 2nd room was extremely hot so we called the front desk who sent up another maintenance man who stated that the AC in that room wasn't working. So, they moved our luggage to a 3rd room and we immediately went out to dinner; upon returning at approximately 11 PM we discovered that the sofa bed did not have any bed linens and that there were no towels/wash cloths in the bathroom. Upon check-out the next morning I spoke with the front desk manager Begona Campos who offered me a couple of small bottles of water for the inconvenience suffered by my family; an offer that I consider an insult to a paying customer. At a minimum I should have been offered a discount on my nightly rate and rewarded with IHG Reward Clubs points.",1,2019,08,05
12,Views ,Just spent 3 nights here with friends. Rooms lovely clean and spacious. Amazing views from rooftop bar/pool. Didn’t eat here preferred to stroll to local square for breakfast. Hotel in a lovely area tour bus stop few minutes walk. Could walk to waterfront in 25 minutes or grab a taxi from outside hotel.,5,2019,08,05
12,Good room very slow/unprofessional seevice,"Stayed for only one night.good room and value,however 
A hotel in a secondary location  that charges 24 euros for
one day parking ,must provide better service.
Ordered through room service tea with soy milk,it took 40 minutes and 2 phone reminders,and finally served with regular milk.",3,2019,07,27
12,Great stay! ,"Very friendly welcome at check in. Club guest room booked at waited in club lounge for room to be ready, complimentary drink & nibbles. Roof top bar staff were frindly and attentive. Fantastic views up there during the day and evening. Club room was lovely  beds comfy and bathroom nice too. Quiet night's sleep, air con good. Probably the best crowne plaza I've ever stayed in for all round service and facilities. Thankyou for a great mini break. ",5,2019,07,24
12,Great Spa!,"I LOVED this hotel, especially when I was trying to relax before going to pharmacy school. The Serena Spa in the basement was the greatest thing about this hotel! It got all my muscles relaxed with high pressure water sprayers, jacuzzis, saunas, and steam rooms!",5,2019,07,19
12,Perfect hotel for a short stay,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona during Barcelona Pride.

The hotel itself is very central, close to the Plaza de España - two metro stations just a short walk away.

The hotel itself is very modern with the focal point being the stunning rooftop pool/bar terrace. Views of the city from the rooftop were incredible. Such a lovely chilled experience.

Firstly I just want to congratulate the management team. Every staff member in the hotel was wonderful, so friendly and accommodating and couldn’t do enough constantly making sure our stay was a memorable one. All our special requests were noted and we were really made to feel welcome.

The room was very spacious with a great view - I would definitely recommend requesting a high floor if you do book.

Beds were very comfy, bathroom a really decent size with great amenities (bath robes, pillow menu etc).

Had a lovely stay, it’s a really wonderful property and would rebook without hesitation if I ever return to Barcelona.

Thanks so much for such a fabulous stay :)

Room spacious clean and good
Breakfast to keep awake for -Fantastic lay out 
Great lobby and great front desk staff very cooperative special mention for Omar  pleasant boy 👦 
Location excellent just walking distance from subway /bus service /taxi what ever u want and whatever u can afford 
Improvement need to have more English speaking staff 
All in all value for money for this hotel",4,2019,07,06
12,BEST HOTEL!,"Excellent location, only a few minute walk from the magic fountains.  My family and I chose to take the hop on hop off tour for 2 days and the bus stop was very conveniently located down the street from the hotel.  The rooms are MASSIVE!!!  Not quite sure why hotels in Spain do not allow you to have 4 people in a room.  I'm not at all comfortable with leaving my pre-teens in their own room.  In North America, you would never find this.  Nevertheless, the rooms again, are HUGE and can definitely accommodate 4 people.  The swimming pool was not a ""pool"" according to North American standards. I would classify it as an aquarium for adults to sit and relax in.  Beautiful view from the rooftop...if you have some time to relax, definitely go to the top, grab a drink and enjoy the view of Barcelona.  All in all, fantastic hotel...pricey for sure, but well worth it!",5,2019,07,02
12,"Nice location, friendly staff for this Modern Business Hotel","Exceed our expectations, as we stayed here for 2 nights ahead of joining a Cruise in the Mediterranean.   The front desk was quite nice and helpful.  Had many suggestions on where to eat, where to find wine stores, and ATM's.  
We very much enjoyed our stay and were given a very nice quiet room looking out the courtyard in the back up at the Cataluna Museum on Mont Juic.  The room was quite spacious with all the right amenities.   Enjoyed the location - easy walking to Espana Plaza, metro, shopping, Mont Juic, and more.
A real highlight is the rooftop bar, however.  What a fantastic place for snacks, meals, and drinks that has an unbelievable view of Barcelona.  You could even see La Sagrada Familia from there!
We'd stay here again for sure.",4,2019,06,28
12,Excellent conference venue,"The hotel is very well located 5 mins walk from Plaza de Espana, and a great choice for conferences and business. Food is excellent and service well trained and friendly. Rooms are very spacious and beds high quality. The roof top terrace and bar offers stunning views over Barcelona. Highly recommended.

12,Modern hotel in historic city,"The hotel is not a central hotel but it is located in a perfect location for the business district ,the Olympic park ,cruise terminal and Barcelona football club.

As a regular visitor to bcn and sitges we regularly stay in hotels in bcn . This one was chosen based on location to the cruise port

We payed for a club room and was not disappointed . The room was huge and the TVs even bigger ! The bed was al
So supersize .

Nothing more to say about the room - ticked every box - twice! Bathroom excellent and the corridors to the room smelt lovely .

The night we stayed athletico Madrid also stayed at the hotel - thought I recognised one good looking fella ",5,2019,06,13
12,"Great location, friendly staffs ","When we arrived at the hotel in the morning around 10am, the staff was very friendly. Especially the lovely girl called Maria who gave us a lot of suggestions what we could do around and for lunch. 

The location of the hotel is also very convenient for metro or bus or even walking. It’s literally 5mins Walk from the magic fountain! We will definitely come back and stay with Crowne Plaza! ",5,2019,06,13
12,Excellent business hotel,"This is a modern, clean, efficient hotel with helpful, professional, friendly staff in an good location on a quiet street.
The rooftop bar is a good place to unwind at the end of the day.
Highly recommend this hotel for business trips.
Booked as part of a bundle with an air ticket it was great value.",5,2019,06,10
12,Amazing Hotel and Wonderfull staff,"We stayed over for a few days in May and was blown away with the room, breakfast, staff and special request which the restaurant staff managed to exceed my expectations. Having this little trip be a special occasion we had Prosecco and Cake delivered to our breakfast table - well done on world class service!",5,2019,06,09
12,EXCELLENT!!,"We stayed at the excellent Crowne Plaza fira centre from 26th May to 1st June 2019 and from the very start, we knew we had chosen the right hotel.

All the staff were very welcoming, we had booked a club room and were escorted to the Club Lounge to check in, while the staff member offered us an array of drinks and we settled on a very nice glass of champagne.

Check in was seamless with the very helpful Cansin, who was very polite, helpful and informative. Cansin and Marc and all the staff were great.

We have stayed in many different hotels with Club or Executive lounges and this is definitely one of the good ones! Juices and alcohol, including champagne all available from 7 am till 11 pm, along with light bites at various intervals.

Breakfast is quite a feast, lots of choice and plenty of it.

The hotel is well situated for sightseeing, very close to the Magic Fountain and the old Bull Ring, where there are lots of great restaurants, and easy access to the hop on-hop off buses.

Up at the roof bar & pool area, all the staff gave a great service, Dinesh, always with a smile and Jordi went out of his way to give a great service, both remembering our drinks. We had a great evening meal just before it got dark, great views, made even better as night fell and area's lit up.

The Crowne Plaza is excellent value in a great location, we would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again,",5,2019,06,08
12,Fantastic,"I stayed at the end of May at this hotel and I think it is one of the best Crowne Plaza (I stayed on various CP and other hotels from IHG ).Even though my reservation was with Reward Nights, I was upgraded to a larger room with access to the Club Lounge , because I am a Spire Elite member. In the Club Lounge I enjoyed an excellent breakfast , drinks, and different tapas during the day .  The staff was very nice and helpful, from the beginning til the end of my stay.  The room was excellent, with a big and very comfortable bed. The rooftop has a nice pool and a bar where you can have a drink/ meal with a great view over Barcelona.
I will definitely come back to this hotel during my next vacation.

12,Absolutely Amazing,"**DO NOT LOOK AT OTHER HOTELS... BOOK THIS ONE IMMEDIATELY**

First time in Barcelona to celebrate an anniversary. We arrived slightly early and did a bit of sightseeing whilst our room was being prepared. 
Maria checked us in with expediency and even upgraded us. Luis escorted us to our room and showed us around. What an amazing start to our holiday. 
The hotel is within walking distance to Sagrada Familia (a slow walk, with stops; it took us about 45 mins) and the sightseeing bus stops are close by. There are supermarkets just down the road, where you can buy wine etc. 
The breakfast at the hotel was nice, and we ate un the El Mall restautant one night- Juan (one of the waiting staff) has an excellent knowledge and makes the best recommendations if you are unsire what yo eat. 
We also had dinner on the terrace restaurant which was also very lovely.  This hotel is amazing and the staff here are the best. Just a word of warning though, if you want to redeem points, book directly with the hotel and not through a thurd party. ",5,2019,06,04
12,Say SI to Barcelona,"First time to Barcelona and loved it. A hip, clean, laid back city. Stayed at the Crowne Plaza and loved it. Great location. Easy to get in and out of. Hotel and staff are TOPS..they greeted us when we got there. Were friendly and polite. Never had any issues they could not solve. Hotel is modern, clean and very relaxing. The rooftop bar was our favourite. With the bar/restaurant as well as pool topside, it was the perfect place to watch the sun go down and see the city come alive.",5,2019,06,01
12,Proper 5 star hotel ,"Very enjoyable stay. Friendly and professional welcome at Club reception from concierge ( Japanese girl  D—?). 
Room was well serviced and had all our requirements. 
Rooftop bar and pool was great place to relax. 
Breakfast in club lounge had everything with good service and presentation.
Hotel is close enough for most attractions but if you have visited Barca several times and not been to this area give it a go. Several good bars close to hotel. 
10-15 min taxi from port ( for any cruise buddies)",5,2019,05,31
12,They missed a right score here,"So were touring Europe with a South Korean KPop band and we land here for the last gig. A wonderful hotel with amazing facilities, including a rooftop bar and pool. This is where they missed a too score for the coffers. We finished our show at the Palau Sant Jordi and the load out was done by 0200 hours, at this point at least120 hungry and very thirsty roadys get back to the hotel wanting copious amounts of alchohol and nibbles. The hotel staff wouldnt open the roof bar, or any bar for that matter, and consequenlty the hitel missed out on about £3000 worth of business (we can drink a lot after a last show). Great hotel and location though, great rooms and staff.",4,2019,05,30
12,Absolutely Fantastic ,This has to be one of the best Crowne Plaza hotels for service globally. Such a warm welcome and impeccable service from start to finish. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to use the club lounge which served breakfast then food and drinks (including Champagne) through to 11pm. The room was great and the rooftop bar with outdoor pool and wonderful view over the city just made it. Would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to stay here.,5,2019,05,27
12,Happy We Chose the Crowne Plaza Barcelona,"We were in Barcelona for two nights pre cruise. We were very happy with the hotel. The room was decent size, as well as the bathroom. The front desk and bellhops were helpful. The bed was fairly comfortable. It is not right in the center of everything, but you can walk to La Rambla or take a taxi for a minimal fee. If we came back to Barcelona we would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2019,05,22
12,"Good location, great rooms, fab rooftop pool","I was lucky that the conference was attending was at this hotel - it’s well set up for business but enjoyable for leisure too.

I had a club room which was Huge albeit very dark. It had a balcony but you would never use it as it was always in the shade.

The bed was very comfy. Fluffy towels. Large shower cubicle. Free WiFi. Nespresso maker in the room. Good amount of power and computer jack slots.

Breakfast had a good spread but quite average.

Club room a little soulless and food in the evenings somewhat scant and boring.

Roof top pool small but great for a dip - there is a full pool and spa for a proper swim. 

Had a delicious pulpo in the roof top restaurant.

Reception could be very busy and often a wait - but staff gracious and helpful.

Would come back when next in Barcelona.",4,2019,05,22
12,Fantastic recognition of hotel loyalty ,"I booked two basic rooms here using IHG points for the weekend of the Barcelona F1 Grand Prix. I am a Spire Elite member. Arriving on an early flight from London, and having taken the Aerobus from Barcelona airport terminal 1 to Plaça Espana, it was a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Whilst our rooms were not ready (the hotel was full all weekend) they confirmed that both rooms had been upgraded to the club level and we were welcome to wait in the club lounge until they were ready. An hour later (before 11.30am) we had both rooms!  All weekend the staff were extremely helpful. We were also given free breakfast for the three nights we stayed in the hotel - a good EUR 100+ of value. I was very happy with the location (10/15 minutes walk from Barcelona Sants station) and would be very happy to stay here again!",5,2019,05,21
12,"Generally an excellent hotel, but it's the small things that let the hotel down","The hotel is ~25 minutes from the airport costing around €30 by taxi. It is a quick taxi ride to downtown Barcelona, but we chose to walk, which takes 30 minutes at a moderately fast pace. 

On arrival as we had booked Club level rooms we were taken up to the Club Lounge, where we were immediately offered a drink and the check-in was very smooth.

We had a suite. The bathroom had doors from both the sitting room and the bedroom. The room was very clean. The bed was king size and extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows. Some of the cupboard storage was in the sitting room. There is a decent size safe big enough for a 15 inch screen laptop.

The Club Lounge was well worth the extra money. Breakfast, whilst the same each day, had a good range of hot and cold food. Drinks (both soft and alcoholic) were available throughout the day, including Moet et Chandon, spirits, soft drinks, tea and coffee. At lunch/evening there was a small buffet of mostly cold foods,which were different each night.

There were minor problems with the rooms which we reported and none of them were really resolved - noisy aircon, a non-functioning razor socket, milk and face cloths not being replenished, the wastepaper bin not being emptied. Nothing disastrous or inconvenient, but it suggests that the systems and processes the hotel use are not quite where they should be for room cleaning and maintenance. Irritating.

Overall a very good stay and the minor niggles would not put us off staying there again.",4,2019,05,19
12,Staff could do better,"I stayed there with my partner on my second visit to Barcelona, this hotel was my second choice as the first was not available. My hopes were high due to its standard. we made requests in advance and were assured via email to be accommodated accordingly, guess what when we arrived after all that tiring flights and trains a very very slow moving reception welcomed us. After a long while its our turn and we found out that she was just reading what we requested and made calls to relevant staff to get the room ready although the room was free as guest already had checked out. Now She told us one hour to wait in the lobby until the room is clean and ready to go. After completing full one hour we went to reception and reminded them about us, then started the procedure of check in another 15 mins and we finally got the key. We were given a nice room okay i am happy about that. later that night TV remote stopped working, we requested night receptionist to just get us new batteries and guess what he came to our room and suggested us that you need to get up from your bed come closer to TV then remote would work, i confirmed again if he really suggested us to do so and he actually said yes. we remained quiet and decided to sleep instead of watching TV. Next morning i went down myself with remote and told the lady to get me new batteries and she called the maintenance guy who quickly changed the batteries and it sorted i was happy with maintenance guy who would rather solve the problem instead of suggesting this and that. Dinner ordered and guess what we got a lonely small chunk of meat floating in a big plate, and chips soaked in blood oozing out from steak. order was wrong we had to call again to get it corrected. at every point we were dictated by staff like we are idiots. to be very honest i stayed in other hotel in my last stay they were like family and ensured we leave happily but here staff was so dry and dictating. At checkout the lady Maria was quite diplomatically active girl which is a plus point to business to keep the customer engaged. She did welcome our feedback and took care of us. Overall its okay experience. they have a roof top as a bonus point with a small swimming pool, i loved that area, room was good, a housekeeping girl Ranjit was nice always ready to help better than the ladies at reception. I would highly suggest customers to confirm about the food what comes in plate as it is not clearly mentioned in the menu e.g. size or weight of sirloin steak, plus what it comes with, eesh i get goose bumps when i imagine that lonely steak served to me. 
Plus points, Breakfast was great large options, room was good and i think their F&B manager was quite nice and active i noticed he was so polite and kind with his staff if i am not mistaken a guy in black suit came in the restaurant during breakfast time. Looks like their GM or Ops with grey hair was also active. but whats the point when your staff is not really active, communication gaps especially at reception, dictating guests night staff, slow moving, staff with partially tied hair in the restaurant during breakfast not good although girls were nicely smiling. things could go much better with staff. Trust me i have been to hotels where nothing right about the hotel but staff and i left happily due to incredibly attentive staff. Pay Attention!!!",3,2019,05,19
12,Nice Crowne Plaza,This hotel is a little out of the way but is very convenient for getting to things in the Placa Espanya / Montjuic area. Note that the train to Montserrat leaves from the station in Placa Espanya and is a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel room is big by European standards and is up to the Crowne Plaza standard. The hotel building is not much to look at on a side street. The rooftop terrace is nice. We ate dinner there one night and the food (paella) was decent.,4,2019,05,11
12,Good for car travellers,The first room I was assigned was not finished - this can happen and was probably more unpleasant for the reception than for me. The second room was big but with an unappetizing dirty carpet (this would have to be changed urgently). On the 6th floor I had a wonderful view. Bathroom with bathtub and separate shower. Nespresso machine. The hotel has a spacious parking garage. The Ramblas can be reached faster than I expected with the help of a city map (intermediate roads). There are also minus points for the roommates who are very noisy after 9 o'clock (probably intentionally).,4,2019,05,08
12,Brilliant,Superb New Years Eve excellent 5**** +staff excellent Food fantastic could not fault anything except the hang over my partner had LoL. Keep up the good work. The hotel from start to finish was in top gear for the New Years celebrations from start to finish & nothing was missed or to much for them B.Z. to the Management /staff  & a Very Happy New Year to them all.,5,2019,05,07
12,Noisy,"Stayed for 3 nights over Easter weekend really nice hotel with decent sized comfortable rooms,however there seemed to be almost constant noise ,people pushing trolleys about at night which really disturbed my sleep.
Also the prices in the bar were really steep,about 3-4 times dearer than the local bars.",3,2019,05,06
12,The worth check in and room service in Barcelona for last 5 years,"I have been visiting Barcelona a lot during last 5-6 years and this hotel killed me by check in at 15.00 and the worth room service I have ever met in Barcelona. I was telling this to reception but really it was just ""ok"" from them or making phone calls to someone, no more. Also they are only focus for club members and of you are a not a club member, you can forget of a lot of things. 👎👎👎",1,2019,05,05
12,Great hotel in decent location,"As Spire was offered a room with club access and free drink. Room was excellent, very spacious and bathroom had all the items you’d expect including slippers. Breakfast in lounge is very good with plenty of choice. Rooftop bar has excellent views of the city.",5,2019,05,04
12,Spotless,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for three nights at the end of an road trip, and were really happy about the stay. Location is great in an area of Barcelona that we hadn't been to before, and there are a lot of great restaurants around.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite, and therefore checked in through the Club Lounge. Check in process was pleasant, and the lounge itself of great quality. We ate breakfast there in the mornings and although not the largest selection, it had all the essentials and I would therefore rate it higher that the full ones on many other hotels we stayed in. We were under the assumption that there would be food in the evenings also, but the one day we tried there were neither any food nor any people there, so maybe we misunderstood.

The room was of decent size with a nice balcony, bathroom with both tub and shower and a comfortable bed. The view was straight into the Fira Center so not too much to write home about, but the weather wasn't too balcony friendly anyway. For the same reason we only had a quick view at the rooftop bar and pool area, but I'm sure it would have been a great place to be on a hotter summer day. 

Only slight disappointment was that I ordered a large taxi through the lounge well ahead of our scheduled departure, but when we arrived with our luggage no one had heard about it and the taxi was not there. We were never in any risk of losing our flights, but had to sit cramped together in a small taxi because of all our luggage. Not a big deal, but still an improvement area with regards to communication. If you don't have any special preference when it comes to taxis though, there are pretty much always some waiting outside. 

All in all though we will definitely consider returning again next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2019,04,28
12,Good hotel ,"Nice location, excellent facility ! Rooms were clean and room size was good - Staff was nice but need to improve concierge service! I will recommend this hotel to any one visiting Barcelona - It was near most of attractions 
",4,2019,04,27
12,"Great hotel, location, staff and experience","We stayed here on a recent family break in Barcelona and found everything to do with the Crowne Plaza as excellent.

Upon checkin my status was recognised and taken to the club lounge to take us through what was needed. This meant for our stay we had been upgraded, even though the room was on points, to get lounge access and a much bigger room.

The room was very large and as a suite meant we had sleeping areas for ourselves and the separate room for the kids. The decor was modern, rooms all spotless and the sleep quality was great with a quiet location.

The facilities were also great with plenty of eating options, roof bar where the pool is and also a gym and option spa if you want that.

The staff were all super friendly throughout, breakfast in the lounge had plenty of options and was a great place to spend some time over the day or in to the evening.

Will be back to Barcelona and back to the Crowne Plaza!",5,2019,04,22
12,Superb hotel,"We stayed here on our first time in Barcelona and it was amazing.

Great selection of food for breakfast. The staff are very nice and friendly, especially the lady at the buffet breakfast entrance was very nice to us and our little girl. 

Rooms are spacious and well maintained .
Unfortunately the rooftop swimming was closed on all four days of our stay there due to bad weather. 

Really enjoyed our stay and can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2019,04,22
12,Excellent ,"Just returned from a short break , what can I say hotel is fantastic ! Staff professional but friendly nothing to much trouble. Rooms spacious and spotless. Roof top bar and pool area great. Would recommend to anyone .",5,2019,04,18
12,Great Location,"We stayed in the Gothic Quarter last week. Due to change in plans we moved from the Wittmore (they were booked) to Crowne Plaza. We're glad we did. The neighborhood is residential and lovely. The Catalan National Art Museum is a couple of blocks away.  Walking is a joy as there are few tourists, no crowds. The hotel is a little worn, but the bedding and beds are top notch. The staff is super. The value if unbelievable. We have a very large suite with club level priviledges. The club has a full bar, wine, champs, soft drinks, snacks- all day!  Twice a day snacks turn into sandwiches, wraps, and kababs!  There is a buffet breakfast thats pretty good. The best is the dedicated club concierge.  They solve problems like well oiled machines. We wanted to extend our vacation, our other hotel (which we loved) had no room!  The Crowne Plaza made lemonade out of our lemons!",5,2019,04,15
12,"Nice staff, good services.",The staff in the reception and restaurant were very helpful and polite. Tasty breakfast with a lot of options. The deluxe room was very spacious and clean. None of the days during our stay we were not disturbed by the woman keeping house. We could benefit of the late check out. It was a very pleasant stay.,5,2019,04,13
12,Great staff,"I have to start with the manager who was on charge on the day of our stay, tall thin gentleman with grey hair, I feel sorry not to remember his name: he was extremely helpful and friendly with us, he made my kid very happy by some favors and he also saved us money by being generous on some services. He made me a future returning customer for sure. Reception staff was also nice and the same applies for the young trainee in the rooftop bar, which is a great spot by the way. ",5,2019,04,13
12,Almost perfect,"Stayed here on business.  Huge room, well appointed and spotlessly clean.  Small problem with the toilet flush was fixed immediately I reported it.
Super-helpful staff on reception, can't do enough for you.  Delicious toiletries. Free water.
The only small let-down was breakfast.  The breakfast room feels a bit institutional and the food was oddly set out at different points around the room.  An omelette/waffle station would be nice, but I know breakfast isn't a big thing in Spain!
Located at the bottom of Montjuic just a few steps from the Magic Fountain and from Placa Espana, with plenty of great eating places nearby.",5,2019,04,11
12,Comfortable in good location,"I stayed at the hotel during a conference the first week of April 2019.  The rooms at the hotel were good size and with good facilities.  Staff at the hotel was helpful.
The Breakfast buffet had good selection for whatever your dietary needs are.
The hotel is in a good place in the city allowing for easy access to restaurants etc.
I would not hesitate to stay again.",4,2019,04,09
12,Amazing value for money. Great facilities and location!,"I would've expected to pay double for the quality, location and service we had at Crowne Plaza. I haven't loaded my Trip Advisor account up for years. But staying here made me want to re-load it back up. 
We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room. Which has 2 double beds AND a seating area. The bathroom had all we needed. There was a separate hall between the front door and room itself. Huge TV. Free Wifi too. 
Breakfast was a little pricey at 19 euros for a basic buffet but it's convenient.
The pool top bar and swimming pool are perfect for couples who want a chilled weekend in-between sight-seeing. 
It turns out that we were in the same hotel as the Athletico Madrid players too. Which was a bonus sharing a lift with them as the prepared to play Barcelona. 
The only slight downside is that the Spa opens at 11am, which is peak time for sight-seeing. So we couldn't really make use of the offers they had. 
But that was a minor set back. A great hotel. 
5 minutes walk from Metro
Taxi Rank outside
Plenty of shops and restaurants within stone-throwing distance.",5,2019,04,09
12,"Unfriendly staff, certainly not a five star","Stayed with my family for 2 nights. Hotel decor and breakfast staff was really good. On arrival we staff was friendly, the lady who checked us in informed us that we can buy the tickets for hop on and hop off bus from them for 29 Euro. I checked in another website and they were selling it for 25 euros. I brought it online and next day I went to ask the reception about the nearest stop for hop on and hop off bus. I can see the same lady behaviour she was so unfriendly and rude. She replied me I don’t know in such a bad way that I haven’t seen a hotel staff so rude. Shame !!! I am visiting Barcelona again but making sure I am not staying in Crown Plaza ",1,2019,04,09
12,Great IHG Hotel,"Stayed for one night after travelling from Australia, as an IHG Member I was granted an early check in  which was a welcome treat! Hotel is well situated for ALL the sights and sounds of the city, Poble Sec underground is 5 mins away. Rooms are fabulous and well equipped, very large comfy beds and all you need after a long flight and indeed for a comfortable stay. Staff were great and I would like to thank them for the warm reception and certainly for allowing me an early check in and an upgrade. Well done, a credit to the chain and to the hospitality of this city. Definitely recommended.",5,2019,04,07
12,Nice hotel with nice rooms,"I had a good time in this hotel, the rooms are very big and have a nice bath room. Breakfast is good and you have everything you need. Wifi is free to use and taxi s are just outside the door. Very nice fitness area and swimming pool.",4,2019,04,05
12,Best breakfast,Best breakfast I ever had in a hotel ever. If you book make sure you get a rate with breakfast. I had a spacious room on a high floor with a decent view. Definitely will book again when visiting Barcelona.,5,2019,04,04
12,A week in Barca ,A bit away from old town but was a nice area as it had several Michelin star well known restaurants around the area such as tickets  and their sister branch. Hotel roof top bar was empty and bar below was closed . We had a paella at their restaurant and it was nice. City has lots to offer and so much to explore ! Loved the Cotton hotel as well ,5,2019,04,03
12,"Really Comfortable, Well Situated Near Congress Centers","I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is conveniently located near the beautiful National Art Museum of Catalonia (which is definitely worth a trip) and very near to convention centers. There are shops and restaurants nearby, and transportation to the center of the city. The Magic Fountain is very near, and worth going to when the light/music show is on. There is a large shopping mall that is only a 5-10 min walk. The hotel staff was very professional and I did not experience delays checking in or out. My sleeping room was quiet, updated, and very comfortable for working and resting. The buffet breakfast and the dining room were quite nice. The staff provides minimal service and does not interact a lot with the guests. The manager/greeter is very friendly but other than that it is difficult to get anyone's attention and some of the food and beverage are not replenished regardless of the time you eat (the tea bags dwindled over a period of 4 days--very strange). The rooftop bar is very nice--a pleasant place to linger in nice weather.",4,2019,03,26
12,A great stay,"We travelled to Barcelona to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The hotel was of an excellent standard with staff where friendly, polite and helpful; nothing was too much trouble for them.  In the restaurant they remembered it was a birthday and my wife's desert came with a candle and a blazing 'firework'!  In the Club Lounge we were met at breakfast by 'Merce' who brought us our hot beverage; after the first morning she had memorised our requirements and we were met by her with our drinks as we sat down.  I noticed she did this for others too - a great feat of memory and one of those little touches that makes you feel welcome away from home.",5,2019,03,23
12,Super service,"Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is primarily aimed at business through its location but is good for the tourist too.

Standout service throughout our stay and fantastic attention to detail by all the staff.  Room spacious and well fitted with usual amenities.

Breakfast good, great views from the bar on the roof. 

Barcelona is big so no location is going to cover everywhere.  This is out of centre and good for walking to exhibition centre, magic fountain, port and mountain cable cars, museum of art, Olympic stadium etc. 10 mins walk to metro at Poble Sec and then 5 mins to Rambla, 35 mins to Parc Güell, 25 mins to Sagrada Família by metro",5,2019,03,05
12,Nice luxury hotel,"The hotel is very nice, not far access with  bus to Airport, helpful staff, rooms are big enough,very clean, good breakfast wide offer, lunch was perfect and delicious, nice room for meeting ,but bad experience was as somebody from outside come during our break meeting and has stolen  one wallet with all document and passport, which we think is usually in Spain as thieves has cooperation with security staff in this big hotels ! Be careful as this can happens to anybody!",5,2019,02,28
12,Barcelona trip - Jan 19,"My wife stayed here for two weeks (Jan 2019) for work commitments and I joined her for a long weekend break. The hotel is very clean with state of the art facilities and is well located to alot of nearby attractions which are easily walkable (Magic Fountain/ MNAC) and is only 5 mins walk from Plaza Espanya stop (metro or Aerobus bus stop to / from airport which is 20 mins). Only a 15 mins walk to Las Ramblas / Gothic quarter district.

The room was spacious with the huge flat TV and free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and the view from 3rd floor lobby lift area is unbelievable.

Have to say the one of the most friendly and very helpful receptionists (Judith) to answer all our common tourist questions (mainly due to taxi strike) but the main attraction for us was the barmen (Walter) as he was just lovely and very friendly every time we visited the bar which was most evenings and he is a great asset to the hotel but be warned the prices a bit high but Walter compensated for this.!!! 

Also, a good range of breakfast choices but we never got to use the main restaurant.

Overall, great hotel, good location, great friendly (English speaking) staff. We were very pleased with our stay, and we hope to be back in the future.

Definitely would recommend this hotel to family/friends.",5,2019,02,22
12,Nice business hotel,"I stayed here for a few days for business meetings and found the hotel very pleasant. The rooms are reasonably comfortable with the standard as amenities of safe, iron, tea kettle, cookies, etc. My only grouse was that the TV had limited English channels - no BBC, CNN, etc. The fitness center was reasonable and the meeting rooms spacious. The hotel is a short cab ride from the city. Would recommend",4,2019,02,16
12,BCN business,"What a surprise, hotel was fabulous, great smell as soon as you enter, helpful staff, business lounge was great service impeccable, great location close to a lot of attractions easily walkable , very impressive , food was so so , spa was ok too not as high end as I expected, there is a fee to access spa",5,2019,02,15
12,Great hotel and staff,"We stayed one night at Crowne Plaza Fira. The hotel is 10 min walk from Plaza Espanya and Montjuic Fountain. The room was large with a huge smart TV. We really appreciate the kindness of all the staff (multilingual), especially Suzanna who attended us at The Lounge. We will probably reconsider this hotel for our future stays in BCN.",5,2019,01,27
12,Good hotel with good service,Really nice hotel. Close to Bus stop. Staff acted on any shortcomings quickly. We were supposed to have a double bed but were given 2 singles. This was resolved by the next day when we returned from business. Would definitely recommend. ,4,2019,01,17
12,Very buisness,Crowne Plaza Barcelona is a class establishment no doubt about it. Rooms modern and comfortable. Service efficient and extremely business-like and if that suits your character this is the place to be. It lacks heart and soul though in my opinion. Very clinical service and no one really prepared to go that extra step to ensure a warm welcome. Would I stay again yes for the cleanliness and comfort but as a holiday maker I just desired a little more personality and the occasional smile.,4,2019,01,16
12,Lovely hotel in a beautiful area of Barcelona,"Modern hotel with spacious rooms. Next to the convention center and close to the Magic Fountain, this hotel is perfect for the convention goer. We particularly liked its proximity to the fabulous MNAC (Museum National of Art de Catalonia)",5,2019,01,15
12,"Great location, good customer service and an amazing rooftop bar!","We stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to going on a cruise.  The hotel was clean, very nice rooms, large in fact considering some european rooms are.  The bathroom was very spacious as well!  The only issue we had was that the air did not work in our room and we could not get anyone to come up and fix it. Due to the time of year it was this was not to bad there was just no air flow at all.
Our first night we had dinner in the main restaurant on the ground floor and the service and food was amazing!  We then went up to the rooftop lounge for a night cap.  The view was beautiful!  Wonderful atmosphere!
Perfect way to start a trip through europe.  I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2019,01,15
12,Well serviced hotel.,"Excellent location a 5-10-minute walk from the metro. The hotel is a very good Crown Plaza, Large impressive public areas, along with a well serviced club lounge (worth paying for the higher-level room to gain access)",4,2019,01,02
12,"Excellent location, few little things could have been better","This is a lovely hotel with nice big rooms, a fantastic central location and a beautiful rooftop view with pool. A number of little things dropped down the rating here. One - there is a nice bar and it would be great to relax there in the evenings with a few drinks before or after going out but the prices are crazy high (we paid €9 for a beer and €15 a mocktail) so you really can't relax there in the evenings (unless you have a nice large budget). The door of the wardrobe in our room would not close and it had a light in it which wouldn't go off - not a game changer just a bit annoying. One of the days we came back to shower (left 10am, came back 5pm) before going out again and the room hadn't been cleaned yet. We had the baby with us so clearing out for them to clean the room was a bit inconvenient. The breakfast was really great (and the staff in there were really friendly) but as we didn't have it included in our deal (I got the trip on points) we opted to go elsewhere most days as it was €38 (+ 10% Barcelona tax).",3,2019,01,01
12,Fantastic Hotel,"I visited this hotel for a conference which was also being hosted in the hotel.

The rooms were huge with all the facilities you need on a business trip. The facilities generally were great and staff very helpful. Food was great too ",5,2018,12,28
12,Christmas break - First Stop in Spain,"Fancy hotel in a sleepy lane - very warmly welcomed and room allotted instantly. Biiiiig rooms, and nice setting. Good breakfast spread - staff ever eager to help. Christmas season had fewer guests staying in - so had easy access to many facilities.
Didn’t have main meals, they did organise for room service for few pizza on request - front desk and lounge staff very polite and helpful...

Great stay with two other families",5,2018,12,26
12,Lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in the city, it's a great base for exploring the sights or visiting for business. Upon arriving the staff were extremely welcoming and I was surprised at the size of the rooms, the room was huge which is quite unusual in Europe. The bed was very comfortable, lovely lounge area and TV as well as a lovely big bathroom. One of my favourite parts of the hotel was the rooftop pool which is built in such a unique way and has a gorgeous view of the city. From here you can see many of the major sights and have a drink or snack at the bar. It's close to the underground stations and only a few minutes walk from the magic fountain which is a great show to be seen at night. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay 100% stay again.",5,2018,12,18
12,Good for work,"Very nice and spacious hotel. Good size rooms with big screen TV and workplace. Lower floor rooms have limited view,so take in mind. Hotel bar is expensive so take in mind. Breakfast was very good and everything was present. Would stay again...
",4,2018,12,13
12,AMAZING!!!,Stayed at this hotel in October for 8 days and from check in to check out this hotel was  TOPS!!! Rooms were spacious and comfy staff were so friendly and helpful they were the best.  Ate at the rooftop restaurant and the restaurant downstairs absolutely AMAZING!!! Its very central to everything. But most of all the day before we checked out we went to the spa let me tell you please don't miss that experience.  Thank you Crowne Plaza for a wonderful stay,5,2018,12,09
12,Fabulous Experience from Arrival to Checkout,"We arrived at this perfectly located hotel after a long day of touring and couldn't have been happier upon entering the lobby. The hotel is clean, modern and chic. Staff were immediately helpful--from the bellman to the desk clerks to the manager--and made us feel welcome and cared for. We were upgraded to spacious, immaculately-clean, comfortable rooms on the third floor and given Club Lounge Access. We had drinks, yummy tapas and delicious desserts for dinner in the Club Lounge and enjoyed an abundant and tasty breakfast--complete with Moet Champagne at both--the next morning. The bathrooms were large with great water pressure and huge, fluffy bath sheets as well as really nice bath products. The room also had a complimentary drink tray with bottled waters, coffees, teas, and hot chocolates. From this excellent location, we walked out of the hotel, to the left for three minutes and arrived at the Font Magica where we viewed a truly magical light/music/water show. The Bull Ring was seven minutes by foot and Los Ramblas about 15. We all agreed this hotel provided the perfect final night of our vacation. ",5,2018,12,08
12,"Modern, Spotless, Accommodations, for the Demanding Traveler","This modern structure that was formerly the Fira Palace, impresses from the outside even before entering thru the revolving door. A doorman invites you in, and the front desk is where the staff makes you feel like a VIP. We were greeted by,  Michella and Jeanine, (please forgive any miss-spellings). Explaining all of the IHG benefits available, we left with some sweets to our room.

We decided to visit the 173 roof top terrace (separate TA review) for a light meal before getting a good night's sleep. The beds are firm and comfortable, the various pillows can be arranged to help you achieve la la land. The modern bathrooms rates a ten plus. Everything about them, layout, easy to operate fixtures, and lighting were perfect. The only hiccup was housekeeping neglecting to leave two wash cloths, fixed later by staff.

The buffet breakfast at L' Aria was a great way to start all of our travel days. Mostly mediterranean, with ""english breakfast"" style hot food, and some asian cuisine. I found it had enough of a selection to satisfy. Attentive staff constantly refilled my coffee ""americano"". Also juices, fruits, and lots of baked goods to chose from. Note to us fussy americans, nothing is seedless, or pitted, so you know. This place only serves breakfast from 7:00 am. till 10:30 am. Earlier the better is recommended. 

Even though the Crowne Plaza Hotel is primarily set up for the business traveler, it exceeded expectations in comfort, and has many amenities for all purposes. It was our ideal base of operation. With a queue of cab drivers just out side the front to whisk you anywhere. It was an easy walk to some major points of interest. You will  feel safe and secure here, as it is next to a police station, (did not hear any sirens). Room safes are always a plus. Room temperature was easy to adjust.

I must go back to service. Jeanine was exemplary on more than one occasion. She walked into El Mall, when no one picked up the phone, to see if a table would be available for us. Her level of customer service was ""five diamond"" as they say. we were able to have a late check out time, allowing for seamless transfer and boarding of our cruise ship. I will whole heartily recommend the Crowne Plaza- Fira Center, to all friends and family who venture to world class Barcelona.",5,2018,11,26
12,Very Good Facility & Excellent Location,"The Crowne Plaza -Fira Center is a great hotel! I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Barcelona that wants to be somewhat removed from all the craziness of the Ramblas district! 
The facility is state-of-the art and is very well maintained. The rooms are large, comfortable and very clean. The bathrooms (especially the shower) are exceptional. We only had one minor problem during our five night stay. For whatever reason, we were unable to get face towels in our room despite repeated requests. Beyond that, all was very good!
I want to give special kudos the Jeannie at the front desk. Although a new employee, Jeannie provided exceptional service to us. She was gracious, kind and very welcoming to us after a very long journey from Los Angeles. Jeannie was very helpful and answered all my questions straightaway. She is a true asset to the hotel's team! Very well done, Jeannie! 
The hotel's public places are spacious and comfortable. The amenities (spa, restaurants and business center) are all very good. (Food in the restaurants was also excellent.)  
I would certainly stay at the Crowne Plaza -Fira Center again when I visit Barcelona. The employees and management are true professionals and are genuinely committed to providing a high level of service to their guests. Thank you!",4,2018,11,19
12,EXCELLENT STAY,"We spent one night on a pre-cruise stay and found the hotel to be well located and easily accessible from the airport to the cruiseport.

The upgrade to the club level entitled us to the use of the club at all times with great breakfast and drinks. It was very nice of the receptionist to put us there based on the Platinum level.

We found the room to be very generous and comfortable with easy control of the temperature and good beds. The bathroom was also very generous except for the shower which seemed a tad narrow if one is over 200 lbs.

We are thoroughly happy with this hotel during our time there, even with the late checkout time! 

Location is closed to Plaza Espana but not close to the old town nor Ramblas if you are a first time visitor to Barcelona!",4,2018,11,18
12,Love this hotel!  It's the best one we stayed at in Barcelona!,"We would like to thank Judith at the front desk for her very pleasant welcome as we arrive at the front desk.  Judith was very helpful and answered all my questions.   The lobby is spacious and has a business centre with computers.  The room is very spacious and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay and the hotel is next to Magic Fountain and very convenient located.  

Everything is great about this hotel and the only comment I have is housekeeping is not as friendly.",4,2018,11,17
12,Fabulous,Excellent helpful staff (English speaking). Rooms are fabulous and a lot larger than normal. Ice machine on every floor. Breakfast buffet was extremely good with high end staff. Very well Air-Conditioned. Nice convenience store right across the street.  ,5,2018,11,16
12,A Very Good Hotel in Barcelona,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for business.

The hotel is located just right next to Fira Centre (an exhibition ground) and just a very short walk to the Fountain and the Italian Twin Towers.  A short walk to the main road and there are plenty of restaurants and eateries.  It is also not far from the airport (20 minutes by taxi) and the Renfe high speed rail station (about 8 minutes by taxi, or walk for about 1.5 km).

Room was spacious and up to date.  Buffet breakfast has a good spread and cater to Asian palate also.  The hotel is also stayed by air crews from a few Chinese airlines.

The top floor of the hotel houses a restaurant bar.  It has a great view of the city day and night.

Though I wanted to try to spa centre, I was told that it was fully booked and impossible to have walk-in customer.  Must be a very popular place for the locals to relax..

Room was of a very good size to accommodate a sofa (bed).  Overall, it was a very pleasant stay except for a few minor points below:

1) My friend and I checked in past midnight.  It seems that there was no update of information after we have checked in.  Rooms were not made the following day, and our names were not in the breakfast list though we have paid for it.  We were even charged for the 1st day breakfast though we have paid in advance.

2) The roof garden bar/restaurant was understaffed and the poor waiter/bartender had to do a lot of thing by himself.  He was very apologetic for it.  It was not a problem for me as I am used to some self service back home.

Overall, it was still a very good place to stay.  The surrounding was safe and well know.  Near to everywhere we need to go in Barcelona.

Will stay there again if happens to travel to Barcelona.",4,2018,11,15
12,Amazing place at the heart of everything,"Visited here for our anniversary, this is an amazing hotel with a central location! Can’t be any more impressed nor can I recommend this hotel more! The roof terrace is amazing with perfect views across Barcelona!",5,2018,11,12
12,Very nice!,"6 night stay at the Fira Center Crowne Plaza for a conference. Really nice hotel. It seems like it's either quite new or has had a refurb. Very clean, modern and stylish. As a IHG member I was lucky to get a room upgrade that exceeded expectations. Breakfast was good, nice selection. Used the gym a couple of times, hard to find on the basement floor but wasn't busy and new machines. On a couple of occasions the wi-fi wasn't working, assume this was because the hotel was full. Nice bar areas on the ground floor and 7th. The outside restaurant on the 7th wasn't open in the evenings, suspect it was out of season.",4,2018,11,12
12,Front Office....,"The hotel's location is around 15 mins from La Rambla by cab.  There are cabs outside the hotel.   The rooms are quite spacious.  I saw a post on Wi-Fi connection being abysmal.  On the contrary, I felt it to be quite good.  We did not do breakfast.  The restaurant on the top floor was closed.  We were told to try it, so I guess the staff was not aware it was closed.  The Front Office and Housekeeping staff were quite good.  I was impressed with them.  The Room Service order taker hurried you.  I would also like to mention the Spa, amazing service, we tried the massages.  Also, the aquatonic pool was wonderful.  The elderly gentleman was very professional!  Great staff.  Definitely will stay at this place again.  There was no signage that said where the gym is at the spa, took me a while to figure out that it was on the first floor.",4,2018,11,10
12,Wonderful honeymoon stay,"We had a great time here. We booked a standard room but were upgraded to a suite because it was our honeymoon.

Room was lovely, spacious and luxurious. Reception staff were largely helpful. Location is close to Font Magica and Plaza Espana, which has a metro.

Only negative here was that the cleaning staff weren’t very friendly. Told my wife that they needed to clean the room while she was still there, or else it wouldn’t be cleaned that day - this kind of thing happened a couple of times. This hasn’t changed our 5 star rating however as we truly did have a lovely time here overall.",5,2018,11,08
12,Very comfortable but wifi connection is abysmal ,I was here for a conference. The room was spacious and comfortable. The amenities were good. However the wifi connection was extremely poor. I kept being disconnected and it took ages for emails to load. Apparently this was because the hotel was full and everyone was connecting to the wifi. I think for a hotel of this stature and in this price range this should not happen. They should be prepared for the event of the hotel being full - especially since this is a conference hotel.,3,2018,11,08
12,"Great Hotel, wonderful position","Nice hotel, located right at the center of events, just a 15 minutes walk and you are at the center. Great staffs and a wonderful recognition for IHG Ambassadors. The breakfast room is marvelous and lovely.

The rooms are quite big when compare to standard rooms in other hotels except that cleaners are not that good at their job.",3,2018,11,06
12,Very nice,Ok location - is close to the former Royal Palace (now a museum and just lovely). The room is very large and well appointed. Everything you could want and more. Staff are very helpful and go out of their way to assist. Very nice stay,5,2018,11,06
12,Business travel choice,"The hotel is located near Fira Conference center, 20 min away from the airport. 
The room is bigger then usually, clean and quite. If you are licky you will have nice view from the room. 
On the breakfast you can enjoy very big veriaty of Spanish and European food. 
Definitely would recommend.",4,2018,10,29
12,Spacious room but mattress too soft,It is really spacious but they have not managed to make it cosy. Our king mattress was a bit soft for me. It is very well located if you travel by train. I missed the terrace which I have heard it has spectacular views. Breakfast  food is ok but nothing special for a 4* superior. ,3,2018,10,28
12,30th birthday stay,We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fira for my wife’s 30th birthday and we loved our stay. When we arrived we was greeted by a very friendly lady who upgraded us as it was my wife’s 30th which was really appreciated. She also helped us with the tourist attraction and gave us a map and circled the must dos when in Barcelona. On our first night cake was delivered to our room for my wife’s 30th as a surprise and what a grateful surprise it was! We also used the spa on our stay and that was very nice too! The rooms are very spacious and have nice views of the city. The hotel is only a short taxi from the main centre and is in a great location to the magic fountains and very close to a shopping centre. Thank you for a great stay and hopefully see you again soon!,5,2018,10,23
12,Pre cruise stay,"We stayed here pre cruise for a couple of days. We found the hotel to be very nice and modern, but a little bit out of the way but not a huge problem. The room was very nicely laid out and the buffet breakfast very nicely done. Would probably stay here again.
",4,2018,10,22
12,A almost perfect stay,"The Crowne Plaza is perfectly located for sightseeing, but still in a quiet area. Check in was effecient and smooth. Very friendly and knowledge staff. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Have everything you need and expect from Crowne Plaza. Particularly the bathroom was very well equipped and had proper lighting, which is hard to find. The housekeeping did an excellent job cleaning and maintening the room.
Not to forget the roof top bar with its stunning view over Barcelona. 
The only thing which can be improved is the breakfast service which was mostly very hectic and not very pleasant due to a lot of noise in the restaurant. It seemed that there was a lack of staff.",4,2018,10,21
12,Superb Hotel with good transport links,"The Crowne Plaza hotel is in a very good location with excellent transport links. We were only a 5 minute walk to the Magic Fountain. 

We were here for 5 nights and we managed to do a lot of sightseeing. 

I would recommend you all to book this hotel as it’s 5 stars from me!",5,2018,10,17
12,Great hotel!,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel a few days ago for 4 nights.  The location was great for us and the bed was just heavenly.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Although not downtown it’s a great place to relax at the end of the day.
",4,2018,10,11
12,Disappointing,"Recently stayed for a business trip The breakfast restaurant area doesn't have enough tables when the hotel's busy. The staff are unable to clean the tables fast enough, so you have guests wandering around trying to find a clean, set table. Having said that, the waiting staff generally could do with some customer training. The two waitresses were excellent, all the men were off-hand and seemed to resent being there. The male manager made fleeting appearances and didn't actually do anything apart from pose at one end of the room or the other.
Food at breakfast was very ordinary. No fresh cooked section, yet calling itself a 4 star business-friendly hotel. I don't think so. Ran out of cereal spoons twice. Cold meats not replenished very quickly.
Reception staff were in a different category. Really good. Nothing too much bother. Chambermaids too were great, happy to fetch extra tissues or toilet rolls or hangers. Can't fault them.
The hotel has a problem with it's flat roof sections. A downpour led to flooding in one of the main conference rooms, with water streaming through the ceiling. Needs some maintenance.
All in all, disappointing. Good in part, poor in others.",3,2018,10,10
12,Perfect place to stay in BCN,"The Crowne Plaza is very good located, you only have to walk ~5 minutes to arrive at the Magic Fountain. The staff was very polite and helpful. We absolutely loved the beds, they were very cozy, even better than at home! Moreover the rooftop offers a great view over the city. The fitness room is very modern and clean, and they have free water for the guests.

Great place to stay for a city trip!",5,2018,10,10
12,Best Crowne Plaza I’ve ever stayed at,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza last week, sadly only for one night.

What a great hotel. Location is spot on, the Club lounge one of the best I’ve ever been in and the rooftop pool and bar area is a fabulous place to unwind at the end of a busy day.

Only regret is that I wasn’t staying longer. 

We will be back. ",5,2018,10,08
12,"excellent hotel, staff very friendly, beautiful location","Best location, wonderful staff, was very welcoming and easy to get to, would stay again, 
also they gave me complimentary late check out that was the best, i would highly recommend this hotel, great stay",5,2018,10,05
12,A very pleasant place to be,"we liked what we found. a very pleasant hotel. the public areas are very nice and welcoming the stuff at the reception are very efficient and well trained. the rooms are very spacious and so are the bathrooms. amenities are plenty.  the roof bar is also pleasing especially if it is not raining and the sun is sinking behind the horizon. the dipping pool is such a treat.  
we just hated the fact that the room service is NOT efficient and that the cleaning service is only taking place late afternoon!",4,2018,10,05
12,Very good hotel in a nice location,"Stayed 2 nights for a conference. I had a suite which had a small bar area with a nespresso machine, kettle, minibar etc. There is a dining/meeting table, massive TV in the living area in addition to another TV in the bedroom (although the remote for the large TV didn't work - could be battery fault, as the remote in the bedroom worked on both TVs). There's a desk with a super comfy executive chair with leg/foot rest. There's a balcony, but the sliding doors are tricky to lock, although there is a security latch.

I had 2 double beds in the room. The whole place had lots of mirrors! The bathroom is separated by a door - bath, toilet, bidet on one side, sink and shower on the other. Toiletries included separate shampoo and conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, bar soap. Slippers and bathroom provided. Huge towels - always a sign of a good hotel! The air conditioning was super efficient! There's separate air conditioning for the bedroom and the dining/living area. The lifts are really quick. House keeping are patient and efficient - I was in and out of the room during the day, and they still managed to find a gap to clean the room!

Breakfast was OK, had adequate provisions, although for a great hotel like this, I thought the breakfast was only average, but certainly satisfactory.

I had room service, which took an acceptable 20 minutes, but unfortunately was rather tasteless - thankfully pepper and salt were provided, I had to use a lot of them!

Check in and check out was easy. I had to leave at 4am, and they kindly organised a taxi for me, but there are often taxis just outside the hotel. 20 minutes away from the airport.

Minutes walk away from the popular Magic Fountain, the adjacent areas are worth exploring. The Olympic Stadium is also nearby. There are plenty of stairs everywhere though!

For keen runners, look out for the running maps by the reception desk, provided various running distances.",5,2018,09,30
12,Ideally situated for the magic fountains,"Just returned from a five night break. As with Crowne Plaza chain of hotels, this one was clean and well equipped. Check in was efficient and quick. Our room (316) was large with two double beds and a clean and bright bathroom. The towels were large and soft. Beds were comfortable. There is a safe and tea/ coffee facilities with bottles of water daily. The only downside was that the room was quite dark and the air conditioning was not as cool as we would have liked. The receptionists were very helpful by suggesting places to go and where to find the metro stations and tour buses. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. The pool is small (maybe six strokes from one end to the other) and most days there were sun loungers available in the afternoon though there are not many of these. Drinks are quite expensive. The roof terrace restaurant had views over the city and enough food choices. The hotel is situated a short walk from the metro station and the magic fountains.",4,2018,09,30
12,Excellent,"My husband stays in Holiday Inns hotels at least 3 Nicosia week most weeks for the last 15 years! This he says was the best.....
We cannot comment on hotel restaurant or lobby bar as did not use them. As a Spire Elite member had access to the Club lounge excellent which was excellent for breakfast and snacks at lunchtime and even evening if wanted. Good range of complimentary drinks freely available.
Room spacious clean and comfortable.
Roof top pool and bar a welcome addition.
Would highly recommend.",5,2018,09,29
12,A convenietly located Hotel for trip to Barcelona,"The rooms in this hotel were spacious and lovely. We had upgraded to the Club Lounge rooms.
Club Lounge was convenient although the food was not to all's taste. 
Plenty to choose from to drink.
Closed at 11pm though
I would stay again
Good breakfast choice
Don't order food into lounge as when it arrives it's quite cold.",5,2018,09,27
12,Good Convention Center,"Location of hotel is great, Staff is very friendly, Very nice and clean rooms as well as the whole hotel, Friendly and helpfull staff. Breakfast is not bad, but could be better. Hotel has beautiful terrace on 7th floor with pool and beautiful view to Castle.",4,2018,09,26
12,Breakfast a big let down!,"A really good stay, rooms are very comfortable and the club lounge access was well worth paying extra for. But the quality of breakfast was really poor for a hotel if this general standard. The “hot” food was lukewarm and the rest of the buffet choice was limited. Staff were inattentive and didn’t serve coffee so guests generally all got fed up waiting and self served.",4,2018,09,25
12,"Top notch, conveniently located!","I was pleasantly surprised as this Crowne Plaza would definitely rank as one of the best! My husband is Spire Elite so we have stayed at many IHG properties and trust me, this is certainly near the top of the list. The overall hospitality and service offered were superb and the amenities were fantastic. 

The rooms we were spacious, very clean and nicely maintained, the bathroom was quite large with a separate shower and tub, and the pillows and bed were very comfortable.  The decor was modern, updated and extremely pleasant. The room also had an additional door to close off the entryway where the bathroom was to help keep the main room quiet and dark to not disturb those sleeping.

Make sure to visit the 173 Rooftop Terrace which  has amazing views of the city as well as very nice amenities.  Located on the 7th floor it was the perfect spot to grab a drink or relax and swim.

We did not eat at any of the on-site restaurants due to our schedule, but the menu options looked delicious. 

The Club Lounge is one of the best I have been to. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We bought tickets for the hop on hop off bus tour and the concierge gave us directions to the Magic Fountains and the Olympic Village which are both nearby. The food and drink selection in the lounge was also top notch and the full breakfast offered was one of the best!  Pay the upgrade to get access to lounge if you don’t have it, it’s worth it. 

Thank you Crowne Plaza for a wonderful stay!",5,2018,09,24
12,Love this hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights following a cruise. The Crowne Plaza was chosen for its proximity to Magic Fountain, which was a tourist attraction we really wanted to revisit. This was a perfect location as Magic Fountain is just a few minutes walk away. The hotel has a popular restaurant which was fully booked during our stay but staff were really helpful in directing us to alternative nearby restaurants. In addition to having a fabulous spacious room with a beautiful bathroom, we were overwhelmed by the friendliness of all the staff in this hotel. On arrival we were spotted struggling with luggage as we got out of our taxi. A porter hurried out of the hotel entrance to help. He also handed us two bottles of mineral water which was very gratefully received! The lady at reception noted that we were IHG members and offered a late checkout which was brilliant. There was also a lounge with complimentary orange, mineral water and Nespresso coffee. On the top floor of the hotel is a fantastic glass pool and bar, low level seating and sunloungers.  The view across Barcelona is breathtaking and found this to be the most tranquil, wonderful  place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing. I only wish we'd had more time at the Crowne Plaza. The standard of customer care at this hotel is second to none. When we left it was like saying goodbye to family despite only staying two nights. The cleanliness in all public areas as well as our room was also noted. I always think that if the toilets in public areas are clean it is  a pretty good indication of how a hotel is run and these were stylish and spotless with fragrant liquid soap from Portugal! We will always stay at this hotel when visiting  Barcelona. ",5,2018,09,23
12,Superb,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a two week tour of Spain. The hotel is large and modern and well appointed.  The room we had was on the 5th floor. The room was large and comfortable and very clean.  Breakfast was great with a good choice of hot and cold food, to suit varied ethnic palet.  The views from the rooftop bar and swimming pool are magnificent.  You can see all that Barcelona has to offer.  Fantastic!  And the location of the hotel was very good.  We were within minutes walking distance from the Magic Fountain, and about a mile from Las Rambles.  What a splendid way to end our Spanish tour.",4,2018,09,22
12,Fabulous outstanding hotel,"My husband and I stay from 6th to 9th off September pre cruise in a suite. This is my second stay at this hotel in the last nine month's.  This time we treated ourselves and stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 6th floor with a balcony room 650 what a fab view it had. The suite was huge with a fabulous bathroom and tons off storage. The club lounge was brilliant and the staff very helpful they can't do enough for you. In fact we had booked another hotel for one night post cruise but we decided to cancel that one and go back to the Crowne plaza. The roof terrace is truly stunning and the pool is small but big enough to relax in. We love this hotel that much we have booked to go back for three nights for New year's eve again. We stayed last New year's eve and it was amazing, the hotel put on a Champaign reception on a roof terrace over looking the palace the view off the fireworks was second too none. Thanks again Crowne plaza for making our stay so enjoyable see you in December.",5,2018,09,19
12,"Nice Hotel , ideally situated. ","I was there for 3 nights for a conference. 
The conference itself was held nearer the airport but i wanted to stay nearer the town . 
Great position, parks etc nearby and the beach and cable cars about a mile away. 

Lovely rooms , with everything you would need eg Iron / safe/ fridge / complimentary water / ice. 

The roof top has a lovely bar area and a small swimming pool and sunbathing area. 

",4,2018,09,17
12,Best Crowne Plaza in Europe? has got better.,"I stay away on business a lot but have used this hotel as a location for special pleasure visits. My wife and I visited 2 years ago and chose to come back for a special anniversary. We thought the hotel could not have got any better and WOW it has become even better. The addition of the roof top terrace/bar and swimming pool is just perfect. The weather and views across Barcelona were outstanding. Club lounge has brilliant staff who could not do enough to make your visit go perfectly. 
Cannot recommend the city of Barcelona or this hotel highly enough.",5,2018,09,16
12,Fantastic,"Normally I would wait until the trip ended but I just had to say what a great hotel I am staying at. Arrived and they could not help enough. The club lounge is fantastic, best I have used and has a hot breakfast with champagne (I’ve stayed at a few Crowne Plaza over the world). The staff are really friendly and the pool bar on the roof top with entertainment is a must. I will definitely be back here! Only complaint is no fresh berries with the gin and lack of tonic choices, that’s the girlfriend, I was ok with the beer 😜",5,2018,09,15
12,"Convenient Location, Comfortable hotel","We stayed here for the weekend as we were over for a concert. We wanted somewhere close to where the concert was but also close to the city centre and near to other tourist things for us to do. We were able to walk to Las Ramblas easily from the hotel and enjoyed wandering the streets, crossing neighbourhoods to get to the centre. There are a couple great restaurants we went to within 5 mins walk of the hotel. Within the hotel we really enjoyed the rooftop bar and swimming pool. Seating and loungers are limited around the pool but we went outside of the height of summer and managed to get a comfy spot with a great view. The mocktails were great, obviously at prices you'd expect of a rooftop bar overlooking a great deal of Barcelona. The rooms was comfy and spacious and we had an amazingly powerful shower. Breakfast was enjoyable, slightly lacking some mornings and had to wait a little bit for items to be restocked but nothing that significantly delayed what we were doing or had planned. All round great location and would return. ",5,2018,09,14
12,"Beautiful hotel, awesome staff","I had a beautiful suite here. Very comfortable and spacious. We were able to work and relax and overall had a great visit. 

The club lounge is really excellent. There is a pool and restaurant on the roof and a spa in the hotel.",5,2018,09,13
12,Nice hotel ,"Stayed here for 4 nights in April, room nice and bed comfy. Staff were ok not too friendly on the reception desk. Breakfast was good varied choice and service attentive. Rooftop pool awesome ! You can see Barcelona from underwater 
",4,2018,09,12
12,Highly Recommend ,"Second visit to this hotel and it’s got better since the last visit three years ago. 

The roof top restaurant is a delight and in general the staff are all very pleasant and accommodating in all department. I can’t imaging staying anywhere else in Barcelona. I stay in around 60 crown plaza’s a year and this is up there in the top three I frequent. 

See you soon. ",5,2018,09,10
12,Nice hotel. Friendly staff.,"Nice hotel. The front desk staff is very helpful and professional. My room (king bed) is really spacious, very clean and modern. The hotel is well located: close to two metro station (Espanya and Poble Sec). Close to the “magic” fountain, Olympic stadium, etc. The breakfast is very good also. One-week point: the pool is vey very small. I never seen such a small before. This pool is unpracticable. I think that the managers of this hotel are not welling to improve this point. This pool is here just to say that this hotel contains a pool. Maybe for the purpose of classification… I give the 5 stars, anyway. I recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,09
12,Good hotel for a short stay,"I enjoyed staying a the Crown Plaza Barcelona Fira, per usual Crown style the room was adequate, the bed and pillows comfortable. Wifi was free and fast enough which is always good. The only draw back for me for this Crown visit was my bathroom was geared up for the less abled person - this was not bad but there was no shower door so water would get everywhere making the floor very slippery and potentially dangerous. Mats were provided however this only covered a small area of the floor.
The breakfast provided was also of a high standard and I found most items to be fresh and delicious. The staff too were pleasant, welcoming and helpful.",4,2018,09,07
12,A happy choice,"We ended up here after cancelling the NH Collection Barcelona Tower hotel following a bad experience in July and what a happy decision that was. It was like chalk and cheese.  At the Crowne Plaza we found can-do staff, large rooms, a city centre location, and an excellent and inexpensive restaurant.  More to the point we stayed in a club room and that meant access to a three-room lounge (breakfast room, bar and TV room) with concierge, free breakfast, an all-day help-yourself bar, and complimentary lunchtime and evening tapas. 
It is located in a partly residential neighbourhood so it is quiet but across the road are a couple of little convenience stores.  The location means it is only a 10 minute stroll from the old Barcelona bull ring in Plaza d’Espana, even less from the landmark archeological museum, and in the shadow of Montjuic with its Olympic Park including the iconic diving board which was a symbol of the 1992 Games.  It is also just across the road from the central conference and exhibition centre.
You cannot get away from the fact this is a large city centre hotel but for all that we found it to have a welcoming almost homely feel, maybe because of the club facilities but, whatever, it is heartily recommended.",4,2018,09,07
12,Another great stay,"Superb hotel.  Stayed here for 5 days. Not far from city center. Close to all amenities and a shopping center. Breakfast was very good, a huge variety.  Didn't have dinner at hotel. Area felt safe, family friendly too.",5,2018,09,05
12,The Best,"My husband said booking this hotel was the best decision I have made coming to Barcelona.   The location is great, so much to do and see locally like the magic fountain, Catalan Art museum, La Serena Mall, train station is walking distance and you can always catch a taxi right outside of the hotel.  The staffs are so friendly, the hotel itself is gorgeous and spacious, with full amenities and family friendly.  We are a family of 5 and we always request adjoining rooms when traveling in Europe and a few hotels like this one were able to accommodate us.  My kids enjoyed the roof top swim pool with a breath taking view and when you get all tapa out, the hotel restaurant “El Mall” is excellent!  We highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,09,03
12,Some issues..but a good hotel away from the city bustle,"Smart looking building fairly close to Place D' Espagne and also MNAC and magic Fountains.
Good check-in , friendly staff. Allocated room on high floor which had nice views and  was much  larger than an average hotel room ( BTW all rooms appear to be large).
Bathroom small but ok. Only 2 english channels on the TV - both News.
Whole place has an air of quietness which can be a good thing - neighbourhood is much more the real Barcelona.
.
Rooftop bar/terrace/pool is very nice indeed with stunning views much more extensive and panoramic than city centre hotels can offer but there is no 'meet and greet' and you have to go and ask for service even tho there was several staff around on each occasion. 
Food we ordered was pretty dreadful and v expensive - seems like they are trying to offer international cuisine to please all the people all the time and not managing it at all.A fair selection of cocktails on offer but way overpriced also even compared to 5* hotels. 
Buffet breakfast not taken on this trip but restaurant appeared busy with international uniformed airline personnel tucking in amongst others. 

Lots and lots of small bars/ cafes etc.close by, approx 5-7 mins smart walk to 2 Metro stations and the Aeroporto bus stops in the square.",4,2018,09,03
12,best crowne plaza in the world,"I have stay in crowne plaza August with my friends. it is good location, near placa d'espanya. and service is good, especially Judit in the lounge. she give some travel tips for me.
and the roof bar is good too. it's good for have a drink and watch the sunset.",5,2018,09,02
12,I like it,"This my second time to this hotel. 
The staff are very  friendly..
The Breakfast nice ( not a big and not a small) 

The location it's a way from shopping areas 

The room service are very good 
And the room size are very comfortable..

",4,2018,08,29
12,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed here with my husband and 2 teenagers for 3 nights with 2 rooms.  Staff were very friendly and the rooms clean and spacey with big bathroom.  The rooftop pool and bar area gave great city views.  Breakfast had a great selection to choose from.  Walking distance to the metro and to the airport bus pick up site,5,2018,08,27
12,Exceptional Stay.,"We stayed for two nights last week and we couldn't have loved this place more. The 360 view from up on the roof was fantastic. The room was huge, with every single amenity you could imagine, a smart TV, robes, and a wonderful bathroom and bed. There was always a taxi right outside which was really helpful and was only a couple minute walk from Font Magica. Great service, great stay.",5,2018,08,26
12,Good Crowne Plaza with good transport links,"Visited the CP Fira Centre for a few nights in Aug 2018. We arrived very late due to a flight delay, but still were given a warm welcome by the night staff. 

The rooms are large and well presented, with a huge TV. The bathroom also modern, with separate bath and shower. We had a wonderful view of the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya from the window. Water is replenished daily and there’s a kettle and coffee machine also. 

We had access to the Club Lounge which is very good. The first we’ve been to with full bar service available all day. Breakfast in the lounge is great - a buffet of really anything you could want. The lady waitress was incredibly helpful. There was just a few things we found unusual about the lounge - firstly the amount of young children; it’s usually a place of relaxation, but did verge on the side of crèche at some points. Secondly - there didn’t seem to be any food/ canapés that are usually brought out in the evening. The only food that was available after breakfast was nuts and pastries. This was very odd - especially given the Moët is free flowing!

The gym is free access (despite some reviews saying otherwise), though the spa is an extra fee. It’s perfect for a good workout - lots of cardio machines, free weights and some static weight machines as well. 

Location is reasonable, being only a ten minute walk to Espanya metro station - which is then easy access to anywhere in the city. However not easily walkable to most city sights. We just used the Hola! Barcelona card for free city wide transport. Also there was only a few restaurants open around the hotel during our stay - being peak August - I imagine they were on vacation also. 

A good hotel, well worth staying in if you want to be slightly out of Barcelona centre. ",4,2018,08,24
12,"Can not,  fault would highly recommend ","We have been really impressed with this hotel. We switched from another hotel at the last minute and are really pleased with our choice. All the staff have been very friendly and helpful. Our deluxe room has everything you need, including a huge bathroom with seperate shower and a bath. The beds and pillows are ultra comfy. ",5,2018,08,23
12,Fantastic Hotel!,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend, best friend and her husband for mine and her husband’s 30th birthday! Our rooms were fantastic, so big and so comfortable. We were given the option of twin beds or king size when we arrived and the king size beds really were king size. They were huge. The bathroom was big and had a bath and a shower which was a lovely touch rather than having to stand in the bath to shower. We could not fault the rooms at all. The staff are so friendly and always willing to help, nothing was too much for them and the lady that checked us in showed us a map of Barcelona with all recommendations and circled them explaining how to get to each. The rooftop bar and pool was lovely, service was a little slow and it’s very pricy but the views are lovely, the pool is nice and it’s a lovely relaxing place to spend the day. The hotel is a little way out from the main town and the beach but cabs are always available outside and they’re cheap enough. You can walk but we did feel certain streets weren’t the types we felt comfortable walking down. My friend and I visited the spa for an anti stress head, neck and back massage and it was the best €55 we have spent. The spa is lovely, staff are friendly and we made use of the facilities afterwards. I’ve been to a lot of spas and can honestly say I haven’t been to one as good as this! Could not fault this hotel and would definitely come back and stay! ",5,2018,08,23
12,Great club room in nice hotel,"Hotel easy to reach from the airport by taking the aereobus. Because of the club room greeted in the club by friendly employé and our first glas of Moet&Chandon... what could be better after a flight? 
Room on the upperfloors so quiet and with nice views. Very well equiped bathroom with shower and bathtub. 
Breakfast in the morning in the club with fresh fruits, juice, Moët etc.... 
If you don’t mind walking you can easily walk to city center. Very close to magic foutain which we found very crowdy and not our thing...
In the afternoon and in the evening you can get tappas in the club. Drinks are also available. 
Roof terrace nice but to small in the afternoon for relaxing because of to little chairs and room for the many guests. But that is just a minor remark.
Excellent hotel for this price range!",5,2018,08,20
12,Excellent hotel,"We stayed as a group in 4 rooms for one week and cannot fault the hotel.

The hotel is modern and spotlessly clean with large rooms which have very comfortable beds and two comfortable chairs. There is a huge flat screen tv, although only a couple of English channels.

The bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower which was nice.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful. There are lots of public areas to sit so the hotel rarely felt crowded.

The best bit is the rooftop terrace with a small pool, bar/restaurant, comfortable seating and a stunning view of Barcelona and the bay.

Breakfast is excellent with a wide range of foods constantly being replenished. One of our group has severe food allergies and the  chef cooked him his own breakfast every morning without fuss and after a couple of days. We ate in the restaurant 2 evenings and had lovely meals. William, the waiter remembered all of the food allergies on our second visit and what wine we had and was friendly and helpful.

The hotel is very close to the Olympic Park and a 10 minute walk from the metro and buses. We caught the Aerobus from the Airport which is very regular and cheap. The Metro is great for getting around but you do have to be vigilant regarding pick pockets. Taxi’s were very reasonably priced at around €10 from the hotel to La Rambla.

",5,2018,08,20
12,Great location for weekend break,"Located on the edge of the city the hotel is easily reached from the airport by the Aero bus if you do not have too much luggage. Close to the magic fountain, Olympic stadium there is lots to experience in the area to get a feel for the city without having to go to the headline attractions.

My hotel room was excellent with all the required modern facilities, the bathroom was a good size with a dividing door to the main living area which I liked. The decor is clean and stylish.

The hotel reception employees were always polite and helpful, and given how busy the hotel is, I was impressed.

The hotel neighborhood is great to explore with many cafes, bars and restaurants to choose from, and a little extended walk gets you to main shopping malls. Of course buses and the metro are available in addition to taxis for travelling further a feild.",5,2018,08,16
12,"Centrally located, comfortable rooms","This hotel is in a great location.  It is 2 minute walk to the Magic Fountians.  There is a stop for the hop on / hop off bus.  The hotel is located directly down the hill from the Olympic stadium.  We walked back from the Jay Z & Beyonce concert in about 10 minutes.  There are markets and several different types of restuarants in walking distance of the hotel.  I really enjoyed my stay here.  The rooms were modern and comfortable.  The most important part the hotel and the rooms are clean.  I would not buy the breakfast, you and find better food for much cheaper close to the hotel.  You MUST have dinner on the roof top while watching the sunset.  It was amazing site and the food was very good as well.  Just may reservations early, they sell out every night",5,2018,08,10
12,Faultless,High quality establishment with high quality staff. I’ve never stayed so long in an hotel to relax. Agree with a previous review Best Club Lounge ever. Only 20 mins walk to Ramblas but also on the edge of Placa de España which is fabulous .,5,2018,08,10
12,Recent stay at great hotel but beware of cost of food,"We had a beautiful room at the Crowne Plaza and the front desk service was great. However, the cost of food at the rooftop bar/restaurant was outrageous and the quality of food was less than desired. 20 Euros for a burger and 17 Euros for very dry grilled chicken was really unacceptable",4,2018,08,07
12,Great location and spacious rooms!,"This hotel is easy walking distance to fountains, transit, and hop on hop off bus.  The rooms are up to date and very spacious.  The roof top bar is a beautiful place to unwind after a busy day.  Staff was also excellent and accommodating.",5,2018,08,07
12,"Great location, spacious and top service","Arrived after a 2 week cruise and on entering the lobby was immediately impressed with the place. It's bright, airy and spacious. We were checked in by the wonderful Judith Cabezas who provided just about the best check in experience I have ever had at any hotel. She was able to give us a much appreciated early check-in and provided lost of useful local information. She was also an all round nice, friendly person. Our room was as bright, airy and spacious as the lobby and had a large modern bathroom with separate bath and shower. We loved chilling in there after two weeks at sea. The hotel was ideally situated for all the things we wanted to see and the rooftop pool and bar area were great for relaxing at the end of a long hot day. I am totally impressed with CP Barcelona - Fira and hope to go back very soon!
PS Breakfast good with friendly service and excellent coffee too!",5,2018,08,06
12,Great holiday,This hotel is amazing with fantastic facilities and very helpful staff. On a personal note of which I have contacted IHG to explain. Otherwise one of the best holidays we have had to date with my family.,5,2018,08,06
12,Nice Hotel,"We checked into the Crowne Plaza on July 8 for 6 nights before a cruise we were taking that departed from Barcelona.  This hotel was located out of the city center a little bit but worked well for us.  It is located a block away from the National Museum of Catalan with the Fountain Magica also close by.  We were about an 8-10 Euro cab ride from most all the places we wanted to see. There was a taxi lot just in front of the hotel which was very convenient.

The staff that worked there were all very friendly and accommodating.  There were multiple languages spoken including English, Spanish and Catalan.  There was a roof top bar, Club 173, Rooftop Terrace that was only one floor up from us.  I will review that separately but was very nice and convenient after a long hot day visiting the sites.

We stayed in room #643 which had a king bed and a pull-out double bed within the sofa.  There was a large work space counter in the room as well with a lot of room to work and charge electronics.  The finishes were a little dated, but the room was nicely furnished with a large screen tv, refrigerator, safe, reclining chair and large closet area for hanging and storing clothing.

There was a light that was on a motion sensor foyer area when you first walked in.  This would go on and off (quickly) and was a little on the annoying side.  It would come on in the middle of the night when on the way to the toilet waking up my family.  Our room was not serviced one day, but fortunately we arrived back at the room around 5:00 pm on that day and brought this to the attention of the room service people who were able to get the room serviced.  Also, there were 3 of us in the room but would only receive clean towels for 2 on more than one occasion.  Other than that, all was good.  

We liked the Crowne Plaza Fira Center and would consider staying here again but also would consider places more city center near La Rambla area.",4,2018,08,03
12,Very luxurious,"I stayed in a suite, which was very big and very luxurious. The bed was huge, the room was plenty big enough for two people. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was good. The rooftop garden / pool was good. Transport to and from the airport is very easy using Aerobus. Transport around Barcelona is very simple using public busses. 
Staying in a suite in downtown Crowne Plaza is not the cheapest option for Barcelona, but if you want to pay for luxury, this is the place to go. I only stayed for a few days but the hotel was a very memorable part of my holiday",5,2018,08,02
12,Great Stay!,"We were here for 4 nights and we had great stay overall.  We stayed 2 different rooms because we went to Madrid overnight then came here again.  The first room was nice and clean, I think it's 501.  The second room was 601, it wasn't very clean specifically the carpet. a lot of dark stains on it.  It needs to be shampooed or replace. It's just a suggestion.  We had multiple conditioners but no lotion in the bathroom.  But those are just minor flaws for me.  We loved and enjoyed the club lounge so much.  The breakfast was excellent and tea time snacks were good. I just wish they change the tea time snacks menu everyday.  I still strongly recommend this hotel and were willing to come and stay again next time",4,2018,08,02
12,Good location away from the big crowds,"While a little overpriced, they do offer specials from time to time and the location is a big plus.  Away from the heavy crowds in the old town but near the fountains with good walking distance to a lot of restaurants.  Rooms are good sized as they cater a lot to the American tourist with good storage.  Breakfast is grossly overpriced and there are many small cafes for good breakfasts close by.  Probably not a good deal to include Breakfast with the room rate.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Hop on/Hop off bus stops close by.",4,2018,08,01
12,Fantastic roof terrace,"We really enjoyed this hotel. The roof terrace and small pool are a real highlight with fabulous views over Barca to the sea. Can be tight getting a lounge in the good weather but worth waiting for one. Typical Crowne Plaza with generous room size, nice and clean. My only query is the breakfast. Reasonable range but wait staff virtually non existent. No chef on the floor although you can apparently order an omelette but by the time you find a waiter, you can’t really be bothered. Would stay again just for the rooftop.",4,2018,07,30
12,Great place to stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and I can say it was fantastic, check in was great we were taken to the club lounge on arrival had champagne. Room was very clean and tidy. Club lounge is a must good value for money and drinks and food available all day . Great Location Just by the magic fountain. Beach is a bus ride away cost 5 euros or a taxi is 15 euros . Lots of places to eat around the city . Roof bar and restaurant is great also lovely pool not big but big enough for a dip and swim had great views of the city . Also was given champagne and cake in our room which was s lovely surprise. I would recommend this to anyone going Barcelona,",5,2018,07,29
12,Nice hotel away from busy streets,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights.  The rooms are clean, beds are comfortable and the staff iare super friendly.  I can highly recommend this hotel for its location too as it is in easy walking distance to the hustle and bustle of the city.",4,2018,07,29
12,Ample rooms but very noisy ,"Rooms ample and the bed comfortable BUT is impossible to rest, maids keep making noise and pushing their carts on the doors (yours or adjacent) no matter if the do not disturb sign is hanged or not. The service in the rooftop bar is bad, waitresses keep yelling at each other. The business center doesn't have a printer (???!!!!) ",3,2018,07,22
12,OK...nothing better or worse,nusy hotel with conference center...good location near shopping and metro stpps. Rooms are clean and spacious if a little antiseptic. Bathrooms clean and functional. Staff helpful and attentive. Lobby is nice.,3,2018,07,22
12,Excellent rooftop pool/bar and club lounge,This is an actual hotel for either business or family. The location is convenient and a quick walk into the Poble Sec neighborhood of Barcelona.  The hotel is very well-maintained and has an excellent club lounge and rooftop pool/bar/restaurant. Because it is not right in the middle of a major plaza it was definitely reasonably priced. ,4,2018,07,17
12,Close to being perfect,"Booked a 2 night stay to visit friends and celebrate our wedding anniversary using my members points. The hotel is situated on the airport side of Barcelona, near the Montjuic area. On arrival we were taken immediately to the club lounge and introduced to Sandra Garcia. Coincidentaly, she had been the member of staff that I had had an email conversation with whilst arranging a surprise bottle of Cava and Chocolates to be delivered to our room on our arrival. After an efficient check-in and explation of where we were using free maps we were delighted with the quality and spaciousness of our room. There are good descriptions of the hotels facilities on their website, but it must be mentioned that the roof terrace/bar/restaurant and pool area is a awesome asset and should be visited. My membership level allowed us free access to the club lounge at any time and we not only had inclusive breakfast, drinks and nibbles but were also able to remain there after check-out, whilst waiting for our taxi back to the airport. This hotel classes itself as 4 star plus and I do not disagree with this. However, when considering the staff I would rate them 5 stars. Everyone we encountered was intent on giving the best possible service, always with a smile and with a 'nothing is too much trouble' attitude. I would not hesitate in booking  this hotel in the future. Thank you making our brief stay so enjoyable. ",5,2018,07,14
12,Facilities,"Absolutely appalled to be charged 25 euros to use the inside swimming pool!! We are staying here for four nights, I am disgusted. The rooms are expensive enough without the additional charges. I was told I could use the outside pool for free. It is no bigger than a fish pool and that is being generous! The photographs are so deceiving, talk about a wide angled lense! The hotel might be nice and modern, however, would I come back, absolutely NO! Would I recommend absolutely NOT! Thanks for ruining  great weekend. Room 235! So very disappointed.",1,2018,07,13
12,Awesome!,"Really grateful for the flexibility! We arrived veeery late due to flight delays and the front desk staff was really nice to give us a late check out so we can enjoy the swimming pool. Although small, we loved the terrace, the view and the chance to have a restful and awesome morning without having to rush out again. Thank you!",5,2018,07,13
12,Amazing trip at a perfect hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights from the 7th -9th July 2018 and had an amazing time from the start. The reception staff were very helpful and we had a super quick check in. The room was huge and had more than everything we needed. Coffee machine, complimentary hot drinks station and a bottle of water.The roof terrace was incredible,views for miles across Barcelona and lots of sunbeds. The pool is also beautiful with plenty of space for everyone to have a dip. We didn't eat at the hotel but I have been told the food is very nice.
We hired bikes on our only full day to make the most of seeing the sights. I would recommend it to anyone, it was super easy as most roads have cycle lanes. And much easier than walking or waiting around for other tourists on the hop on bus.
All in all we couldn't fault the hotel or the service we had. Thank you to everyone who made our stay perfect ❤️",5,2018,07,10
12,"Very good hospitality, kind staff clean, just ecxelant.","We had been there for 6 nights. The rooms are excellent, clean and comfortable.
The staff was very kind and and helpful. The breakfast was very good. 
I would highly recommend to stay there. The metro is not very far,it is very close to Fira center.",5,2018,07,10
12,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Great location, close to excellent hop on hop off tour. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast very good and room large and comfortable. Nearby tapas  bar referred by desk staff was excellent.",5,2018,07,10
12,excelent location and good rooms,"great sized room.big comfy bed with good quality bed linnen and pillows.shower was good and good sized towels.the curtains give a reasonable blackout 
there is a fridge and a table to work at.
decor is low key and all in all a very nice city centre room.
breakfast was good with plenty of choices",4,2018,06,22
12,Wonderful Hotel,The Crowne Plaza Barcelona-Fira Center was wonderful.  The staff was so friendly and they understand English.  They were so much patience with someone that did not speak the language.  The bar and restaurant on the top floor was great with amazing views of the city.,5,2018,06,18
12,Not bad,"The property appears nice, and the views from the rooftop are nice.  Rooms and bathrooms are spacious.  Also a quick cab ride to the cruise terminal. Lobby is spacious, and it's a few kms away from the main tourist area, la ramblas, so a little quieter.

In terms of negatives, the rooms I booked were not ready until after checkin time and when we got them, they stunk strongly of cleaning products so we could not stay in them for long. I wonder what the people before me did to need that much cleaning!  the air conditioning also did not work well, as it was warm in barcelona when I was staying there.  It says on their website that someone there can speak english, but they really can't.  The service at the rooftop patio is slow.",3,2018,06,13
12,Pre Authorisation not credited since 25 days,"I stayed in this property on the 25th May. Upon arrival, i was told to give my card for the preauthorisation and during check out, I was made to settle the amount again. After asking repeatedly, can i get a receipt of the preauthorisation, Begona a member of there staff told me the preauthorisation is released and the money will br credited within 7-10 working days but nothing like that happened. I tried calling the hotel so many times, no one answered. The next day someone answered and told me to write an email to their accounts office. Its been almost a week and I haven’t got any reply from the accounts office",2,2018,06,11
12,Vacationing,"Extremely nice hotel. Good location, great personnel. Reasonable prices. Clean and comfortable rooms. Gorgeous roof top terrace with a bar and live music at night. Highly recommended to anyone looking to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2018,06,04
12,A really great hotel ,"The reception is impressive and the rooms even more so. Huge beds and fabulous bathroom await and if you have access to he club lounge, this is REALLY worthwhile. Breakfast is excellent. Pool area on the roof has stunning views and whilst the pool looks fabulous it was totally rammed with kids and their parents when we were there which was slightly disappointing for us because we wanted a quiet float in the pool",5,2018,06,01
12,Good value hotel and good base location,"Overall, clean hotel and spacious rooms.
Located in Montjuic area and thus walking distance to Montjuic park and Montjuic fountain, metro station, and Placa D'Espanya.

Make sure to check out the cool rooftop bar with great city views!",4,2018,05,31
12,Great hotel in a good location,"I organised an event in this hotel and it was a great experience all around. The hotel is very good, the rooms are huge and the bed was extremely comfortable. the best part is the roof top terrace with amazing views of the city a great place for a drink. there is a small unheated pool which was unfortunately too cold for us to try. the food is also excellent and the staff very friendly. its very close to the museum with the magic fountain and plaza Espana",5,2018,05,30
12,"Cloudlike bed, helpful staff, great location ","After leaving our cruise we arrived around 10:30am.  Staff very accommodating and offered us early checkin. The room was full of all amenities including cloud-like pillows and bed, massive tv, coffee facilities, mini bar and very large room. After travelling around Italy and sleeping in small rooms with hard beds, I wish we could travel with this room! Breakfast offered full buffet and no a la carte options which is my only complaint. Roof top bar offers wonderful view of city.  ",4,2018,05,29
12,Great Hotel - Great Staff - Great Location - Not so great lounge food,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel for few days. Location is great - hotel is very clean and modern. I would suggest this hotel to anyone. 

One suggestion for the hotel manager. I had access to the hotel lounge - free alcohol and free taps. I was tired of eating chinese eggrolls and indian chicken with beans... every single day... 

I think you really have to change the menu of the lounge. Bit boring and not good at all.",4,2018,05,29
12,Big disappointment,I am a IHG member and just checked in to Crowne Plaza for 4 night stay which has been prepaid.  Window lock is broken leaving room unsecured. The outdoor pool is only open till 7pm and the indoor pool on the website is part of the spa so children under 16 cannot use. Staying with my 12 year old daughter who has been left disappointed that after sightseeing during the day she can only use the outdoor pool til 7.  Front reception staff were confused at opening times and more importantly the assistant front reception manager Begona was very rude pointing out to me a page on the Crowne Plaza website which she says has the opening times for the outdoor pool.  On the same page it also had the indoor pool with no direct mention it is part of the Serene Spa and there is in fact a charge to use this.  Daughter is too young to use spa.  Deeply disappointed that the pool times are limited and the front reception assistant manager was rude and dismissive.  Disappointed that as a IHG club member this hotel has taken my money for the 4 nights so customer service is not necessary.,2,2018,05,28
12,Wonderful location,"The hotel was great..flight arrived about 10am..we were able to check in with no problem.  Was able to walk to shopping areas, restaurants and the hop-on hop-off.bus.
The hotel offered European outlet..and when it didn’t work offered to charge up phone for us",5,2018,05,28
12,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for one night only, as we extended our stay, and our other hotel was booked.  So we chose to stay in this area, walking distance ( as in 2 min walk) to Barcelona art museum on Montjuic, and maybe 5-7 min to Plaça Espania.  A wonderful hotel.   Rooms are HUGE for Europe, big even by US standards.  Lovely bedding on a king size bed.  Breakfast was excellent.   They cater to cruises and airline personnel, so there were multiple items from the Asian kitchen, as well as Everything from the western world.  Views most directions from the hotel. They have a lovely rooftop bar and sitting area, music is on in evenings ( not sure if only w/ends). There is a spa in the hotel ( seemed a bit pricey, then again it was a 4 star hotel) as well.  What we paid for this hotel is ridiculously less than for much less room in the very center of Barcelona.  So if comfort is a need and price is an issue, this is an excellent compromise.   Very close to a couple of places, otherwise just a metro trip away.  Easy!!  ",5,2018,05,26
12,Excellent hotel with great rooftop view,Our tour group stayed here the last two nights and this was one of the nicer hotels.  Very quiet so I slept well.  The breakfast buffet was good and the servers were attentive.  Nice pool but I wish they opened the pool earlier and closed it later.  The beer at the top floor was expensive - $8 EU's for a Heineken.  The snacks were very good and the people were nice.  I would recommend staying here.,4,2018,05,24
12,Love this hotel!,"Away from the chaos, but still within walking distance of places to see. (Font Màgica de Montjuïc is a >5min walk) 
The L3 is really close & only 2 or 3 stops away from the city center. Public Transit here is super easy! 
Staff is very nice & accommodating. Rooms are spacious. We have 2 little ones, so we got the Club room. the Sofa folded out into a bed & the crib fit well in the living area. Still plenty of room for us without feeling cramped. 
Upgrading to a club room is worth it! free breakfast, drinks available (beer, wine, liquor & campagne), tapas in the afternoon & the evening. 
we loved it & would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice family friendly place in Barcelona!",5,2018,05,22
12,Spectacular Rooftopbar and excellent beds,"It is always a pleasure to stay in a Crown Plaza hotel. Regardless where you go, the service is correct and friendly. The Rooftopbar offers a magnificent view over Barcelona and is a good place to unwind with a cocktail and life music. The food is good and the service is very friendly.
The Breakfastroom however...a disaster....the Acoustic is soooo poor that you could swear 200 people are eating and talking at the same time..it is so loud that you start the day already with stress. And don't forget the Tetra Pack eggs...horrible. How can an Hotel of this status, serve this. It is a disgrace for every cook. Is it so difficult to do this the old fashioned way, with eggs? The coffee doesn't deserve this tittle. It is warm, but that's it.",4,2018,05,22
12,Superb Hotel,"My mother & I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.Rooms were absolutely spacious & pleasantly furnished.This hotel is a harmonious blend of luxury & comfort, as a guest you really feel at home & you are always treated like a VIP.besides I like its location since it was within easy walking distance of subway station & in the most beautiful part of city.",5,2018,05,21
12,Sensational Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay here for my wife's birthday. Service, room both excellent. Convenient location for Plaza D'Espanya, Transport, and Airport Bus. Amanda at the front desk was the best and extremely helpful! We would happily return. Whole experience could not have been nicer.",5,2018,05,19
12,"Good hotel, good location","A good hotel with good customer service, genuinely can't complain about the room as it was spacious with large tv, safe and decent sized bathroom.

Good breakfast option a very big variety, however it can get busy though.

No problems with the late check-in, and taxi's are literally waiting outside, however we opted to use the metro, the Espanya stop is a few hundred meters walk from the hotel.

The magic fountain is literally up the road from this hotel. Great views from the hotel rooftop which has a pool. But you can only sit on the seats if you're buying a drink which was the only drawback. 

Hotel has a gym and an indoor pool as well as a rooftop pool. I'd use the same hotel if i were to come again.",4,2018,05,13
12,1st. class customer service!!,"I have to congratulate Sandra Aparicio at Front Desk because she really understood our needs and took according action. Keep being like that Sandra!

Tengo que felicitar a Sandra Aparicio de Recepción ya que entendió perfectamente nuestras necesidades y actuó de acuerdo a las circunstancias. Sigue así Sandra!",5,2018,05,12
12,"Good, but expensive","We choose this hotel for short family overnight stay, needed to be in that area. Also availability of family rooms was one of main criterious to choose one.
Hotel is downhill of Montjuice, just 5 minutes walk to famous fontains and to Arena shopping centre and metro junction. Airport aerobus stop is also located close to Arena, so convinient to accessing BCN.
Hotel is quite expensive ( >200 eur for family room ), but in decent quality and good location. Rooms are large, large and comfortable bed. There is roof top terrace and bar, situated by roof top pool ( actually large aquarium better to say :) ). Nice views of Barcelona from terrace. Breakfast of regular quality, nothing specific. Service  attentive in reception, not so in bar and during breakfast.
Positive: comfortable room; reasonable location
Negative: nothing specific to mention
Would recomend.",4,2018,05,11
12,Convenient to the Fira Conference Center - and that's about it.,"The location is far from the tourist attractions but convenient to the Fira Center. The hotel appears relatively new, and the room was modern, large and very comfortable. The breakfast had a good selection of basic items, but about 25% of the selections were Chinese food. This was probably because Chinese Air Crews lodge in this establishment, and every single morning there would be maybe 15-20 crew members having hurried breakfast before their flight and dominating the buffet room.

Service is spotty in this hotel. On check-in, the gentleman behind the desk behaved almost with aggression, as if he were extremely annoyed that I had showed up. The room cleaning service is very irritating, since they would show very late in the day, after 4 pm, and, they would march in even if you have the ""Do not disturb"" sing on the door. Judging from some detritus on the floor I noticed on the first day, and which were still there a week later, they did not appear  to vacuum the room regularly, and they would leave behind a harsh dirty/detergent smell akin to the one found in public bathrooms.
Service in the breakfast room and  the rooftop bar was very good. The rooftop bar served good fare and had live music. It offers wide vistas of Barcelona, albeit a city with rather uninspiring skyline.
I would recommend this hotel only if you want to be close to the Fira Center area.",3,2018,05,07
12,Expensive but lovely hotel in nice location,"The front desk staff provide a warm welcome to a top-quality hotel experience, with many amenities. While close to Plaça Espanya and Avenida del Parallel, the Crowne Plaza is a peaceful oasis amidst the bustle of this busy city. The rooftop bar is a lovely spot to unwind with a drink after a busy day, with a nice view of the city. The room was spacious and nicely appointed. My only complaint was that the duvets are too warm. You have to crank the air conditioning to avoid waking up overheated. A sheet option would be nice.",5,2018,05,07
12,Fab stay - staff and room were great,"Fantastic time at this hotel. From check-in with Judith Cabezas (who delivered 5/5 customer service) and throughout our stay, we will definitely be returning. 

The staff in club lounge were incredibly informative at advising on where and how to get to places

12,"Nice location, OK hotel. Not sure why they did not post any points","Hotel is OK, good location. OK rooms, clean and modern. Terrace has a beautiful view of the city. Had a big disappointment when the 5 night stay, 200 Euro a night rate did not earn me any points. Ridiculous! I could have gotten a cheaper rate online, but my company booked me as part of an event. Why is a very high corporate rate not eligible for points? That is bad business. I will avoid booking at this hotel for our event next year!",3,2018,05,04
12,Best of the CP Brand,"Three time's here now and this hotel has provided a consistently high standard of service and accommodation.

Club Lounge is most impressive and good recognition of Spire Elite status.

Barcelona in itself is a great destination and CP makes it just ideal.

Rooftop bar and pool gives perfect views",5,2018,05,01
12,"Friendly, helpful and great location ",Located at the foot of Montjuic this hotel is in a great location.  Rooms are spacious .  Staff very friendly and helpful.  The Club lounge is one of the best you will find.  Well stock snacks and drinks at all times and a full breakfast buffet.  The only things that could be slightly improved are the window double glazing and seals to keep out street noise from passing traffic or nearby school and the pillows.  Could do with sone soft feather type pillows.,4,2018,04,30
12,Beautiful and close to attractions,Short walk to the main events. I experienced good food. Catalonia is a beautiful place and everyone needs to go there. Transportation is easy to get around the city. Trains and bus systems rock in this city.,4,2018,04,29
12,Consistently excellent,"This time we booked a suite and were not disappointed. Once again staff were helpful, especially as we arrived early from a cruise ship. Settled in the club lounge whilst we waited, we relaxed in a lovely calm atmosphere on comfortable seats. The suite gave us the space we wanted on this stay and the bathroom with its walk in shower as well as bath was excellent. We ate in El Mall in the evening. We had turbot which was cooked to perfection and generous in size. We would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona as we also love the quiet streets of the business district.",5,2018,04,29
12,Excellent Hotel ,"Front desk are amazing and very helpful plus welcoming.
Rooms are big and fully equipped with every single need.
Bath was very nice and well organized also equipped with all you may need.
Location is amazing and a taxi is always awaiting in front of the hotel. 
Walking distance to great Art museum of Catalonia and also to tour bus station. 
Breakfast was very good and delicious 😋.
Luxurious hotel that deserve your booking, I forget to tell about the fabulous roof they have with nice small pool but the view from top while you have your drink is amazing seeing whole Barcelona. ",5,2018,04,28
12,Visiting for a conference,"The hotel was very nice, food was average. Located right beside Mont Juic in a beautiful part of part of Barcelona, its quite central and not far from las ramblas or the underground transport. The staff in the hotel where not helpful and this was very disappointing. The hotel room was nice and cleaned regularly.",3,2018,04,26
12,Wonderful hotel just 10 minutes from Espanya,"A fantastic hotel with wonderful rooms, spotlessly clean. We stayed for 4 nights and the hotel staff could not have been any more accommodating. Spacious bright modern rooms with very nice toiletries. We really enjoyed our stay and the delicious breakfast that awaits you each morning was on its own enough to make us want to return. Don't miss the roof-top terrace with amazing views over the city.",5,2018,04,22
12,Very good stay for Bacelona exhibition center purposes,"Stayed there while going to the exhibition center in Barcelona, great location for that purpose.
Suite king was one of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in terms of space, comfort and amenities.
Good breakfast, excelent business center. Nearby (about 5 min walk) there was a very nice tapas restaurant “La cañota”.
Didn’t have time to go to the rooftop swimming pool, nor fitness center, both of which i was told were very good, as well.",4,2018,04,21
12,Great stay for a birthday trear,"We stayed here in August 2017 as a couple. Our first time in Barcelona and now we are due to return in May this year thanks to this lovely hotel.

The hotel is a nice size, clean and modern. It is within walking distance to the centre and the beach. Also there is train station 5 minutes away which you can take to get to all tourist location including the football stadium. Getting last minute tickets to the football match or even going for a tour is really worth it and an experience in itself.

The rooms were large, complete with all amenities including ironing board, iron, hairdryer and tea and coffee facilities. Our room and hotel were very clean. 

The staff were absolutely lovely, the concierge especially would help us when we needed a late night pizza delivery. 

We were hoping to stay here again this year but unfortunately the hotel was booked, not sure our new hotel will be able to match this great experience.

Hopefully we will be back soon 
",5,2018,04,19
12,"Wonderful, high end gem in the city","This is a very high quality Crowne Plaza, which could certainly compete with an Intercontinental in terms of fit-and-finish and in quality customer service.  We are regulars of this hotel chain, but were especially impressed with our experience.  The rooms and lobby appear to be spotless, modern immaculate.  The restaurants were all very high quality, and we love the rooftop pool with the panoramic views of the city.",5,2018,04,15
12,Amazing stay,"I would like to recommend everyone traveling to Barcelona for business or leisure this hotel. Its conveniently located next to Barcelona exhibition,  the airport  is a short  taxi ride away  and  minutes to the center area. The rooms are spacious and updated. Great customer service skills and no line for IHG members, plus a very surprise room upgrade and free bonus.  However, what really made my stay,  was the outstanding, attentive and friendly service received from the staff, in particular I would like to thanks Michela at the reception and the Club  Lounge. They made me feel very welcome, anticipated me on every need and made my stay fabulous. I really enjoyed the Club Lounge, which is a great place to relax, with quality freshly prepared snacks and drink, both alcoholic and soft drinks. Breakfast  is excellent with a good range of options and may be the only thing missed is a live cooking station for eggs, omelets, crepes etc.. I look forward to staying here again, when next I am visiting Barcelona.     Grazie Mille!",5,2018,04,10
12,Excellent experience,"When I came to crown plazas hotel everything was quite enjoyable and excellent.
I would like to appreciate all the staff of this hotel especially Sasha and Andrés.
I highly recommend you to go this hotel and experience their accommodations.",5,2018,04,08
12,"Exceptional Stay, First Rate Club Lounge and Service","Our family of two adults and our sixteen year old enjoyed our four night stay at this hotel. We booked a king suite with separate bedroom, living room with sleeper sofa and huge bathroom - plenty of space with the sink and shower area separate from bathtub and toilet. Our suite also had a balcony overlooking the street. The room was very clean and very quiet with excellent sound proofing and the bed was very comfortable.  Good Wifi speed. We took a very quick and inexpensive ride from the train station by taxi, less than 10 euros. We arrived in the morning and were extremely pleased to be able to enjoy breakfast in the Club Lounge and check into the room. 

The Club lounge provided a plentiful breakfast with a wide selection of choices. It is also well stocked with a wide variety of beverages all day long. Top notch liquor, wines, champagne, juice, waters, sodas, tea, coffee in addition to presentations of tapas.The Club Lounge is well worth the extra cost for breakfast alone. We found the service to be exemplary in the club lounge. 

The location is less than a 10 minute walk to the metro and in just 2 to 3 quick stops you are in the heart of Barcelona. The Magic Fountain is just a 5 minute walk down the street. For the same price of a much, much smaller room in the Barri Gotic or Eixample, we would definitely stay in the King Suite/Club  Lounge at the Crowne Plaza.",5,2018,04,07
12,Very good,"We stayed as a couple here during September 2017 during our visit to Barcelona. The location is quite good with easy access to metro and rail. Being a spire memeber I was upgraded to a suite and was given lounge access. The staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful.

The rooms were spacious and clean.",5,2018,04,05
12,Loctite celebration 2017/18,"Reception 100%
Room 100% very large TV incl all modern features
Key broke down twice fast service
Breakfast 100%
Very near to place Espagnol
outside pool on the 7th floor incl bar perfect service little expensive",5,2018,04,04
12,Probably the best Club Lounge EVER!,"This is an excellent hotel! The quality of service is superbly professional and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is well located just next to the Magic Fountains. Great access to all parts of the city. 
As I am a Spire Elite member, we were upgraded to a suite with full access to the Club Lounge. The hospitality and facilities are stunning from the second you arrive. You check-in in the lounge and we were offered the first of many glasses of Moët Chandon. The lounge is open from 7 am to 11pm. There is food and drink on offer all day. The breakfast has an excellent selection of hot and cold food and of course Moët!
Everyone is extremely friendly and very attentive. 
We dined in the hotel restaurant one evening and it was good quality. 
As this was my birthday, we were looked after well and treated to extra cake and amenities. 
I have stayed in many Crowne Plaza hotels across the world. This was the very best of them all! 
You must not miss this hotel if visiting Barcelona. Pay the extra to upgrade to a Club room, it is worth every penny!
There is no other place to stay in town. We will be back again soon! 
Thank you for a wonderful stay! ",5,2018,04,04
12,Fabulous Easter Break,Just got back from a lovely break at the Crown Plaza Barcelona. The hotel was lovely from start to finish staff couldn't do enough facilities were excellent the room was lovely and spacious. I would definately recommed this hotel.,5,2018,04,03
12,Beautiful hotel amazing staff ,Just back from our first trip abroad as a family with our 9 month old little boy. After 3 hour delay with a 9 month old teeth child we arrived at the hotel gone midnight very tried and stressed but as soon as we got to the hotel our trip was completely turned around. The night staff where fantastic helping with our luggage and a fast check in to get us off to our room. The hotel is beautiful and the room where great with cot all made up for our very tired little one. We eat the tester one evening and it was delicious and again staff where great. Will be returning again and would highly recommend.,5,2018,03,30
12,'Another first class stay',"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday, which was our 3rd stay at the hotel and again we had booked a club room. We found check in to be friendly and efficient and our suite was large and spotlessly clean. We made full use of the club lounge, which is a great place to relax, with quality freshly prepared snacks and drink, both alcoholic and soft drinks. Breakfast in the club lounge also provides a very good selection to choose from with attentive staff. We had lunch in the 'El Mall' restaurant, which is located within the hotel, where we had the Iberico ham as a shared starter, and the Sea Bass and Turbot for mains. The food was excellent and service was personable and first class. A great birthday treat and finish to our stay. During our stay we found the staff to be very welcoming and efficient. In particular I would like to thank Ana (club lounge reception), Carme (restaurant) and Miguel for looking after us and making our 3rd stay a memorable one.",5,2018,03,28
12,Great 9-Night Stay for the Barcelona Marathon,"I really enjoyed my 9-night stay for the Barcelona Marathon.  The hotel was a 5-minute walk from the start and finish line.

I stayed in room 532 and it was spacious with adequate closet space.  Room had a safe and a stocked mini-fridge.  There were a kettle and a coffee maker in the room.  Bathroom had a bath tub and a separate shower stall.  There was also a bidet.  Hot water supply was good.  Bathrobes and slippers were provided.  Toiletries were supplied.  A free bottle of water was provided each day.  TV worked well but no CNN nor BBC.  

Free wi-fi was easy to log in and relatively fast.  I didn’t use the pool but I did use the exercise room which had two treadmills, an exercise bike, an elliptical trainer, and free weights.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and spoke English quite well.  I had also booked the breakfast buffet option.  Breakfast buffet was available starting at 7 am each morning in the L’Aria Restaurant on the ground floor and it was available at 6 am on the day of the marathon.  The buffet breakfast was good with a wide variety of options including Asian food.  During the Barcelona Marathon weekend, the restaurant offered dinner and lunch buffets which helped with the carbo-loading.

I also took advantage of the breakfast box option when I needed to leave early in the morning.  The breakfast box option is free if you have booked the breakfast buffet option.

I also had dinner twice in the El Mall restaurant in the hotel.  Food was good and the service was friendly and efficient.

The two nearest Metro stations, Espanya and Poble Sec, were a 5 to 10-minute walk from the hotel.

I did have an issue with housekeeping but it was quickly resolved to my satisfaction.",4,2018,03,27
12,Excellent hospitality overcomes shortcomings.,"This visit started poorly, as the small drop off area in front was occupied and four parked taxis with drivers outside the front door smoking blocked the entrance.  No bellman was to be found, so I dragged my four bags (off a two-week cruise) to the front desk.  After all, who leaves their bags out on the sidewalk as they go and search for a bellman while the apparent taxi drivers mingle about?  This was not an auspicious beginning to a three-night stay.  

From the first negative note, matters improved quickly.  I was already slated for a Club lounge room upgrade (an a spire elite) to a modest suite, and was given immediate access to my room despite the pre-noon check-in.  The room was clean, modern, with an expansive bathroom featuring bath, bidet, toilet, and separate shower.  The bed was especially to my liking, new and soft enough for support.  The room featured an outdoor balcony, not useful though for a March stay.

The club lounge is among the best I have visited in the IHG chain featuring Moët & Chandon Champagne, fine red wine, top shelf liquor, and little snacks available throughout the day.  After 7:30 p.m., more substantial pre-dinner snacks come out.  The lounge desk as well as waiter service were attentive.

The location was fine for my compulsive walking, as I never took a taxi during my stay even though I toured throughout the Gothic Quarter, visited the Sagrada Familia, and went up Montjuïc to see the fortress.  Most would need taxis though for these trips.

Throughout my stay, the staff was courteous and very helpful.  Checkout was seamless, with the luggage pre-loaded into my taxi by the bellman.",5,2018,03,25
12,Fantastic stay,"Really nice, clean comfortable place. We stayed for a long weekend. Helpful staff. Great facilities and close to attractions and restaurants etc. would highly recommend and for sure will be coming back to this great city-Barcelona. ",5,2018,03,18
12,Lovely hotel,"My husband and 16 year old son stayed here for 3 nights in February. The hotel is lovely and clean, modern and in a good location. We had a standard room which  was more than adequate for our stay. Close to the Olympic stadium, magic fountain, shopping centre and transport links via Pl. Espanya. Lots of nearby restaurants and shops and around a 25 minute walk to las Rambla. The hotel has some beautiful views via the rooftop terrace and even a small pool for when the weather is good.

My only gripes would be that the beds were a very standard double (they felt quite small), when towels were replaced we only received two and not three, sometimes they forgot to leave milk and the bar can be quiet pricey, all of these did not hinder our stay and I would still recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2018,03,12
12,Good but with a couple of faults,"I stayed for one night whilst in the city on business. For these purposes it was perfect, a large room which was very comfortable with a good shower. My only criticism was there wasn't a plug socket near the bed for charging the mobile. 

The other slight annoyance was €19 for breakfast was very, very expensive considering the average buffet which was served.

I will probably try somewhere else next time.",3,2018,03,03
12,"Great Hotel, Close to Metro for easy access to City Centre","Booked a surprise trip to Barcelona for my family and decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza.  I was a little concerned that it was away from the City Centre, but it was so close to the metro (5 min walk).

I had booked a suite so that four of us could stay in the same room, although the IHG call centre made an error on the booking, the hotel honoured the booking so that we could all stay in the suite.   The room was large, with a super king size bed, separate lounge with sofa bed, and a decent sized bathroom.

The club lounge was excellent, with a range of beers, wines, and spirits all on offer together with snack throughout the day, a free breakfast is also provided in the lounge.  This made the extra room fee worthwhile as we probably saved over €100 per day with the ""free"" drinks and food!   

The staff were all very helpful and attentive to our needs.

There is a large conference centre next to the hotel, so I would expect the hotel to be very busy when there is an event on.",5,2018,02,26
12,Pleasantly upmarket,"Quick weekend trip away using my IHG loyalty points

Hotel was absolutely perfect, right in the middle about 5 min walk from the Magic Fountains!

Bedrooms huge and comfortable, food in restaurant really good

Staff all exceptionally helpful

Bonus for us was complimentary use of Hotel Club Lounge which has drinks and snacks available free all day! 

Overall well worth a visit and highly recommended",5,2018,02,19
12,Very Good,"Impressive hotel and great location. Very attentive staff and I had a nice big room. The only negative was a constant intermittent vibration from somewhere in or around the room, which kept me awake. Bed was a little hard but I’d look forward to staying there again.",4,2018,02,17
12,A Surprise Somehow,"I'm not sure why I didn't expect much form the this Hotel.  It certainly wasn't cheap for our one night stay.  However, the check in on the club level was pleasant and quick. The staff, never intrusive, was polite and ready to assist. The club lounge was simple and comfortable but elegant at the same time. The roof top bar and restaurant made me want to never leave.  You simply have to see views of Barcelona like this once in your life.  I would certainly stay here again but maybe for a bit longer.",5,2018,02,05
12,Happy daze in Barcelona,"A modern hotel with large room and bathrooms.  We had a twin room which had two, very comfortable, double beds.  The bathroom was large with a separate toilet area.  There was lots of wardrobe space.  The roof-top bar/restaurant and pool area had sweeping views of Barcelona.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The hotel is in a quiet part of the town down the road from the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.  It's an easy walk to the metro",4,2018,02,04
12,Amazing Barcelona Hotel,"I stopped here while at a conference nearby in the City and I am very pleased I did.
The staff were very knowledgeable, kind and friendly. They really made me feel at home and this service continued through my stay.
The club room is awesome after a long day. Unwind with a glass of wine or a cold beer - well recommended!
Breakfast is great with every choice and good staff to bring coffee etc.
The room was large, very clean and I liked the Espresso machine and bottles of water.
The location is good. 5 mins walk to the nearest subway. Some great tapas bars just over the road. Quiet location.
I liked it so much I have booked 2 rooms in March to come back with my wife and family.
One of the nicest Crowne Plaza hotels I have stopped in. I am a Spire Elite IHG member, so I stop in a lot!",5,2018,01,29
12,Crown Plaza - around the corner from the where the Olympics was held,Very nice clean hotel.  Conference center.  Big lobby with nice bar.  Rooms are small but adequate - ours seems narrow  - same with bath.  Comfortable though and the room was carpeted!!  We were on the second floor and avoided the elevator which took a while if you needed it.  Stairs were just fine.  Breakfast bar was fine. We ate at restaurants in the area for the tapas.  Lots of places to walk to nearby.  Including the old bull arena that now has bars and restaurants and a great view at the very top via an elevator (nominal charge).  You can also walk to the old Olympic area and take the escalator to the top of the old Spanish Pavillon which is now a library.  Great area for pictures.  Not far from the water.,5,2018,01,15
12,Great Stay,"We had a great stay at the hotel. The staff was great and friendly. Room was clean and spacious. 
One complaint though, we tried to make a reservation at the spa before our trip and the staff member there couldn't speak english. (There is no way for the front desk to book a treatment.) We thought we had one booked but she never actually made one. When we got there they had no more openings for me. Very disappointing.",4,2018,01,11
12,Fabulous hotel,"My husband and I stayed for three nights from 29th December in a club room on 6Th floor, the room was massive and the bathroom was fabulous,  my only complaint was the room could do with new carpet. The staff are so helpful and friendly can't do enough for you, on New Years Eve they opened up the top floor terrace for us to celebrate the New year with champagne and mulled wine. This was such a nice touch and the view off the fireworks was awesome with a lovely atmosphere,  we will be back next new year. We have already booked to go back next September love this hotel.
I must mention an Italian restaurant that a member off staff recommend virtually next door to the hotel it's called IL Golfo Di Napoli SL it's amazing and the owner is a lovely guy his pizzas are fabulous and reasonably priced you must try it.
Looking forward too trying out thrcpool it looks lovely and the roof terrace is stunning,  you really must try this hotel you won't regret it, but you must book the club lounge well worth the extra. Thank you Crowne plaza for a really fabulous break.",5,2018,01,06
12,Very Comfortable hotel,"We stayed over the new year holiday for 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza, Barcelona,.

if you are in Barcelona for any reason i would recommend the Crowne Plaza the hotel is modern clean and very comfortable

The rooms are very large and well furnished and the bathrooms are also large and well equipped

We had booked into Club rooms with Lounge Access again a very god choice and i would highly advise anyone who can to upgrade

this is not a Mandarin Oriental, Intercontinental, or a Conrad Hilton ,what it is , is an excellent comfortable hotel with all the required amenities

I have stayed in all of the three mentioned groups several times and would honestly say that the Crowne Plaza in Barcelona is by far one of the most pleasant hotels we have stayed in

Whenever i am back in Barcelona or surrounding Area this willbe my hotel of choice",5,2018,01,03
12,Great stay ,Lovely hotel with lovely staff. Rooftop pool and bar and the menu was an added luxury to our stay. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Also we had  dinner at el mall restaurant during our three day holiday in Barcelona.,4,2017,12,28
12,Above and Beyond,"I will start by mentioning the cleanliness, spacious rooms, and amenities this hotel offers in a quiet, yet convenient, centrally located neighborhood in the heart of Barcelona. But I want to focus mainly on the staff’s attention to detail and warm welcome throughout our stay. We recently visited this hotel with our infant son and the staff could not have been nicer or more considerate. From the immaculately made baby bed they brought to our room, to the visit from Santa Claus at breakfast on Christmas Eve, this hotel staff truly made this visit a special one for all of us. Each staff member we encountered was friendly, approachable, and helpful: from the manager and the front desk staff to the housekeepers and the dining staff, everyone was so welcoming! I also feel compelled to mention the fair trade toiletries and locally made towels and linens in the hotel. The responsible business practices were absolutely noticed and appreciated. We will definitely stay with this hotel again on our next visit to Barcelona! ",5,2017,12,27
12,"Great hotel, great staff!","We visited this hotel this month, and the girl in the club lounge was such a delight, I want to come back already! The lounge services were incredible, everyone was so helpful! Breakfast was delish, room was great as well. We left to the airport really early and the lounge even packed a to go breakfast.. I was so impressed! We will be back. Thank you for a great stay!",5,2017,12,27
12,Lovely hotel,We stayed here for a short city break in August . It's a little out of the bussel of the city but we enjoyed the walks into town and there's a lot around the hotel to see . The room was lovely as was the restaurant we only had breakfast there but it was a great way to start the day . The roof bar is lovely a little pricey but the view is amazing be aware there are not many seats or spa around the pool.It was a shame the pool was shut on the day we were going to haxe a few hours around the pool so check if this is your plan. The spa was lovely a great chill zone.,4,2017,12,24
12,pleasant stay,"I stayed here for one night, after a couple weeks of airbnbs around italy, and it was a nice change of pace. fantastic large bathroom, comfy bed, big tv, and really good food. i would stay here again when back in Barcelona. also, the magic fountain is just a short walk, a must see.",4,2017,12,18
12,"Fabulous and attentive service, great hotel","I stay at a lot of IHG hotels around the world which includes Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels and I must say that this hotel is one of the best hotels that I have experienced in terms of customer service.  From the very first greeting to leaving the hotel, the staff could not help us enough to make our stay in Barcelona more comfortable and easy.  From helping us book tickets to attractions on the internet and printing them off for us, to providing some anticeptic solution to help my blisters that I had walking around the place.  Their rooms were very spacious and the food excellent, the hotel has a separate spa which is operated by another company I think, which costs 15 Euros for 90 minutes to go to.  The hotel has its own pool as well which is free to guests but is an outdoor pool on the 8th floor and un-heated, so you can go if you are brave enough in December!  Location is fairly convenient, its around 7 minutes walk from two different metros, the main one is on Placa Espanya.  We picked this hotel because the Aerobus from the Airport stops at Placa Espanya which made getting to and from the airport very convenient.  Its worth looking up the Aerobus option from the airport as its cheap (10 Euro return - but don't lose the return ticket!) and they are very frequent.  Placa Espanya is the first stop from the airport.  Metro is really easy to use, buy the T-10 ticket which gives you 10 trips on the metro, bus or tram for 10 Euro.  One tip is to look at the reverse of the ticket to see how many trips you have left, it prints a line each time you use it.  The hotel is also close to two good attractions within walking distance, the Color Water Fountain display ""Font Magica de Montjuic"" which is on between 8-9pm Thurs-Sun and The Spanish Village ""Poble Espanyol"" which is worth a visit (although a bit touristy).  Its also close to the Castle up the hill, you can get there by bus opposite the fountain, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your time there unless you are really interested in history as its just a large square buidling on top of the hill with views of the docks and containers below.  I need to give special mention to three people who helped us so much during our stay at the hotel - Paul, Ana and Ona.  Ana and Ona were very helpful in booking tickets and explaining things to us and made our stay really special - thank you!",5,2017,12,16
12,Superb hotel,"The best hotel & service we received on our trip. Better than the Indigo and Intercontinental in Madrid. 

We were provided the club lounge and upgraded to the junior suite because of my spire status. Upon arrival, we were brought up to the lounge for check in. The lounge itself is quite nice and has lots of drinks and amenities to use. 

We were surprised when we got back to the room after dinner as the staff had provided us with champagne and chocolate as a honeymoon gift. We checked out the spa and would've definitely given it a shot if we had stayed longer. 

We'll probably stay here again during future visits.",5,2017,12,14
12,Will come back again!,"Stayed three nights in November in a Club room with twin beds. I read many reviews where the hotel would upgrade the guests if they hold status with IHG. I am a platinum ambassador (understand the ambassador only counts in intercontinental but there isn’t one in Barcelona!!) and I was not upgraded to a club suite as I had hoped.

The room was very decent and the beds were good sized and comfortable. They gave two bottles of complimentary water but some times they forgot and you could call the front desk to get more. The toiletries were ok... and the overall location was decent and accessible to subway. Taxi was always available at the front except for the day of the strike. This I wished the hotel would have informed us at the club or via letter in the room.

The club was the best part. Very good breakfast for European standards. Filled up every morning until we could eat anymore and the food was of good quality. Lasted us well into the 2pm lunch hours. No afternoon snacks but the evening Canapés were good. Always changing and not the same stuff every night or even hour. Really enjoyed the spinach croquettes and fish burgers! My friend enjoyed her Champagne ever night.

Will return the next time in Barcelona and probably will not book a club room and let them upgrade us instead. I went during off peak season! But during peak season, I would secure a club room in my booking.

 ",5,2017,12,08
12,Service is not that impressive but the lounge is nice.,"The location is not the greatest if you have kids.  it is located at a awkward locations, in between stations.  The service is relatively slow as it took more than about hour to check in but they made it up with free flowing MOET since BREAKFAST.  So by the time I checked in I had like 6 glasses <-- that is how long it took.  Overall it was decent",4,2017,12,07
12,Excellent,Excellent hotel with awesome customer service.  Rooms were huge and comfortable and we had a lovely stay.  Roof top bar was deserted but staff still ensured we had an early evening drink and snacks and this was appreciated.  The view is spectacular and not to be missed.  Taxi's always outside and are cheap to whizz around town.  Check in and out was quick and easy.  Hotel stored luggage for us on Sunday prior to our airport departure.  The only issue was staff at Breakfast had to be asked to fill up coffee.  First world problems and all that and a small blip in an otherwise excellent stay.,4,2017,12,04
12,Fantastic!! Have already been back for a second stay,"Great location, rooms and outstanding customer service. Ona at club level concierge gave us 5 star service and was the reason we came back! Mercedes in the breakfast lounge was also wonderful.
Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!!!
",5,2017,12,03
12,crowne plaza,"we used a bus to get off the airport. the journey takes about 25 minutes and costs 5.90 euros and it is better to buy a return ticket. it takes you to the Plaza Espana which is the first stop and from here it is about 7 minutes on foot. we had a paid club lounge for 50 euros per room per day. Check in and check out are done directly at the club where the receptionist is available throughout the day. There is also a private breakfast where there is enough choice of meals and much less people than breakfast in the lower restaurant. a freezer with beer, alcohol and champagne are available throughout the day. twice a day there are snacks and sandwiches to eat, and some sweet, but in the evening there was a problem with the addition, everything quickly disappeared and nobody did it. the room was big and clean, the only problem was with the TV that did not work but the next day we exchanged it. in the bathroom we had both a bath and a shower. Dinner was ordered through room service and we were not very satisfied. Beautiful views are on the top floor of the hotel with its bar and outdoor pool. Tickets of a different attraction is better to buy over the internet, where it is usually cheaper and without queues. We traveled around the city by subway where we bought the T10 ticket for ten trips and you drive for both. I recommend visiting camp nou, mercat market, montjuic, sagrada familia.For more information about barca here is my email travelmiky79@gmail.com",5,2017,12,02
12,Very accommodating staff,"I made a mistake and booked  4 nights prepaid.  When I arrived I told the front desk that I needed to leave and go to France for one night.  The manager checked with central reservations and was able to refund me for the one night I could not stay.  With my IHG status the hotel also upgraded us to the club level, which was very nice.  I especially apprciated breakfast in the club.  The rooms were great, and I loved the location.  The hotel recommended good restaurants in the area.   i will stay there again.",5,2017,11,28
12,Awesome Stay and Great Customer Service!,"We truly enjoyed our stay. The customer service was awesome. Some additional Pros:
1. Rooftop bar, 2.) Close to the Hop on Hop off bus pick up location, 3.) Spacious rooms, 4.) walking distance to restaurants, and 5.) The Club Member Lounge is worth every penny. Complimentary breakfast, snacks and drinks are offered. I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center.",5,2017,11,28
12,Prompt attention to any complaints,"These guys really want you to know they are listening! My room mate was unhappy that the mini-fridge was not restocked and they came up quickly to restock. Also, she didn't understand the laundry instructions and when we went to the front desk to give them our credit card info, the hotel employee there saw that my roomie had had problems and helped her right then! The rooms are excellent and their shower divine!",5,2017,11,20
12,Spain,I liked the room very much.  It was spacious and well designed.  I loved the aromatherapy sleep aides. Dinner at the restaurant was expensive but the food quality was very good.  I had two service requests which were answered quickly although one was too late to be answering the door and could have waited.,4,2017,11,19
12,BEST HOTEL WE HAVE STAYED AT,"We had booked a standard room for 3 nights but upgraded to a Club Room upon our arrival.

The hotel is located within an 8 minutes walk from Placa d'Espanya  (which is a beautiful, very large plaza only a few kms from the centre of the city). 

As all the club rooms were fully booked, we agreed to stay in the room allocated on the 2nd floor, with full Club access and breakfast. The room was very large (for Spain!), ca 35sqm and beaufifully appointed. Being on the second floor, we didn't have much of a view!

The Club Room was a pleasant surprise! The room itself was (surprisingly) located on the floor above the reception and did not have any views to talk about. It was, however, a nice room, well appointed and stocked with any spirit, wine, champagne and soft drinks you could wish for as well as an expresso machine and heaps of assorted cakes. A good variety of food and snacks was brought in at 14:30 and at 19:30 every day and unlike most of the club rooms we have stayed at, we had access all day and night to the full compliments of drinks!

The breakfast, which you could have in a large annex to the Club Room, or downstairs in the main restaurant if you wished, was the best we have had anywhere in the world (including some pretentious 5-star hotels in Asia). There was anything you could wish for, hot and cold.

After touring Spain, we were due back in Barcelona for a further 3-days. We had purposedly not booked any hotel beforehand as we thought we would have a look and see what Barcelona had to offer while we were there the first time. However, we enjoyed our stay at Crowne Plaza so much, both the hotel and the position, that we had no hesitation in booking again for our return trip. Once again, we booked a club room (this time on the 6th floor with nice views and we never regretted our choice. (The room was identical to the one on we had the 2nd floor).

In conclusion, let me say that the staff were all very friendly and helpful and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. The hotel may only be rated as 4 or 4½ stars but to us, it was pure 5-stars

Ruth & Jørgen Hansen",5,2017,11,19
12,Good quality in a well situated area,"Modern and functional hotel. Ideal for businesses and really close to Fira. Warm and nice room. Only can say that breakfast could be a little more varied (i.e. bad quality cereals)
Good access to parking area",4,2017,11,15
12,located in nothingness in Barcelona,"The hotel is far from metro station,located in nothingness in Barcelona.The staff is unprofecional and negligents,in lobby printer dont work even they dont give us invoice because their printers dont works too.
Big rooms/really big rooms/ with view to residential blocks.Cleaning the rooms start after 15.00 at afternoon,its strange for me.Good breakfast nothing special.And dont recerve room through their site because they will cheat you-I make that mistake for best price but for them best price is stretching concept.if you want to punish yourself that hotel is right for you.",1,2017,11,13
12,Returning next trip to BCN,"Everyone on staff from the front desk to room service delivery was super-professional and friendly. The room was very comfortable and had more than everything we needed. The location is not in the middle of all of the action like La Rambla, but it is a pleasant walk to Fundació Joan Miró, Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, and Museu Arqueologic de Catalunya. All of the other sites in the city are reachable by Barcelona's very comprehensive metro system. The morning buffet was very generous  and a good value. I can't wait to come back!",5,2017,11,13
12,Still the BEST hotel in Barcelona!!!!!,"This was our third visit to Barcelona in the past 16 months and our second visit to this truly lovely hotel. From the moment you arrive you are completely taken care of with a really smooth check in and your baggage taken up to your room. The management have a brilliant team of people working for them, who are professional, polite and courteous!! The hotel itself if simple the best, comfortable spacious rooms, an excellent club room and now a roof terrace with swimming pool that is just fabulous well done to the Crowne Plaza- Fira Center!! You deserve all of the Excellent reviews because you offer all your clients a truly amazing stay in Barcelona and make them feel so welcome that they will want to return,again and again, we certainly will!!!",5,2017,11,12
12,Superb hotel with outstanding service,"Very central location next to the fira center ( exhibition)  - stonethrow away from the catalan museum, magic fountain, placa espagna and Las Arenas shopping center. Plenty of bars, small shops and restaurants closeby. 
Very spacious and nice room with great bathroom including shower and bath. 
Very  friendly and helpful staff. The gym is the technically best equipped I‘ve ever seen and worked out. Small but absolutely state of the art ! We tried room service - food was good and quickly delivered. 
Great roof top bar  with small pool, sunbeds and lounging area. Extraordinary view - enjoyed the sunset here, We highly recommend the place and would defenitely stay here again !",5,2017,11,10
12,Great hotel central to everything ,"Stayed for a Birthday treat for myself and 8 year old son, 5 days.  Hotel modern clean and spacious. Staff pleasant and helpful, needed football tickets printed out, which was not a not a problem. Roof top bar a must, amazing views out across the city.  Taxi’s placed right outside, always available, and only a few euros to las Ramblas or a 20 minute walk. Right next to the famous magic fountains which are a must to see, only on Thursday Friday and Saturday throughout winter.  Beds were on the small size, small double I would say, although room well equipped and cleaned and stocked everyday.  
We paid for breakfast the first day which was quite expensive at €53 for 2 adults and a child. Lots of places to eat just 2 minutes down the road for breakfast and evening meals. Bakery & little supermarket just across the road. Overall lovely place and would definitely return. ",5,2017,11,10
12,Fantastic 50 th. irthcsy trip,From start to finish this hotel is amazing.  Upgraded our room. Spotlessly clean.  Used the club lounge. Amazing breakfast drinks all day. Tapas lunch and dinner should you wish to use it.  Very friendly staff. Nothing too much trouble.   Amazing spa. Peaceful and relaxing.  Great location.  Easy to get everywhere on the metro.  Bus straight from the airport and. 5 min walk.   This hotel made my husbands birthday a very special few days away.,5,2017,11,10
12,Comfortable and convenient city hotel,"Situated close to Playa de Espanya this luxury hotel is conveniently for access to the major convention centres as well as to good shopping malls and restaurants. It has a lovely rooftop bar and pool, for relaxation away from the city hubub, with glorious views across the city.  Staff and facilities at the hotel are excellent.",4,2017,11,08
12,Exceptional Service,"Spent a couple of nights here in October. On arrival we were taken to Club Lounge for check in as Spire Elite members. 

The room was extremely comfortable and up to date, it was also very quiet.

The weather was appalling when we stayed but between visiting the excellent Spa for a couple of hours and then reading in the Club Lounge, which was open from 07:00 to 23:00, we passed the day quite easily. When the monsoon calmed down we ventured out. the location of the hotel is very good, we actually walked from Barcelona Sants but there is a tube stop at Place Espana which is only 10 minutes tops from hotel. There are many restaurants and mini markets within 2 mins walk from hotel. When next in Barcelona I will return here.",5,2017,11,07
12,"Great size room, good location, rooftop restaurant","We spent a Saturday post cruise overnight here. We got there at 9am and left at 4pm Sunday and they accommodated us by taking the bags off us checking us in but told us to return to get a room after 3. This bit didn’t work well as when we returned the girl had left early but the room we got was massive, with good views over Montjuic.
The TV had no English TV as BBC news was down. 
The breakfast was very good with lots of choices and we got a late check out Sunday. 
The location.is in a quiet part and nearest early opening restaurants were a 10 min walk away at the Arenas the old bull ring. It was ideal for the Montjuic fountain display which was 200 yards away. This is well worth seeing but the times change so even the hotel had to look up when they were on. The bus tour stop was near the fountain so you could see most parts  easily. The hotel had a lot of Japanese guests some being airline crew and there was a Japanese convention at the Fira.
Staff were very helpful but check in should have been smoother. Would recommend.",5,2017,11,07
12,"Great weekend stay at the Crowne Plaza, Fira Center, Barcelona","Great hotel, fantastic facilities in a good location. Handy for travel on all public transport, especially the Metro. Modern rooms, great Spa and the view from the Rooftop Terrace bar day or night is brilliant.
We will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,11,07
12,Top notch hotel,"Love, love, loved this hotel! Stayed many times in Barcelona but this hotel has surpassed other visits. We booked a club class room, well worth the extra. Snacks in the evening, breakfast and free drinks, very nice touch. Great location too to explore the city, I highly recommend as I had no complaints at all. Looking forward to a trip back some day 😎",5,2017,11,06
12,3 and a half would have been the perfect score,"This is a really interesting hotel.  It is in a more residential area of Barcelona away from the touristy Las Ramblas, although not far in a taxi, also only a ten minute ride from the Cruise Terminal.

There is a small taxi rank outside the hotel.  And a taxi ride from the airport costs around 25 euros with reasonable traffic and luggage.

We had booked a club room and were upgraded to a club room suite as spire elite members.  Unfortunately though as the guest in the suite we had been allocated decided to stay on we had a suite on the 2nd floor instead on the 6th - so very limited views!   But we did get a very early check in 11.15 - thank you Crowne Plaza.  A nice little balcony though even if it only over looked the local school.

The suites are nice although a little dark even with all the lights on.  The bathroom is large with a bath, toilet and bidet in  one section and a walk in shower and sinks in the other section.  Lots of towels, slippers and dressing gowns too.  Also a safe in the room.

The club lounge is awesome here!  Nibbles at lunch time between one and three thirty, appetisers in the evening too from seven thirty to ten ish.  And Moët champagne and other drinks including spirits, wine and beer available, all day.  Breakfast is also served adjacent to the lounge - although we weren’t majorly impressed with that - more later.

You also get to check in in the club lounge on floor A  sitting down comfortably rather than queuing at the desk downstairs 😊.  The lady who checked us in was excellent - Danxza Zhou,mand even offered to move us later in the day if the suite on the higher floor became available. We declined but appreciated the offer.

Internet is easily operated and free.

The best thing about this hotel now is the roof terrace on the 7th floor  (as big a draw as their excellent club lounge)  with a small infinity pool , sun beds and bar area with patio heaters, and awesome views of Barcelona - fab !! Friendly bar staff and even got to have my favourite Spanish liquor Pacharan !

Food in this hotel from our experience in the lounge is a bit hit and miss!  Bacon was freezing cold at breakfast and the sausages were rock hard...  you can also get cereal, toast, fruit and cold meats etc.... the coffee is distinctly average.  

Re the appetisers in the lounge some are nice, some aren’t lol, and if you find something you like grab it quick as they probably will eventually refresh it with something else...lol.... you don’t often see the same thing twice.  The other strange things is food that would normally be accompanied by a dip, spring rolls, chicken fingers, prawns etc, were quite dry as there were no dips whatsoever....??
 

Alcohol wise it is plentiful a choice of a couple of brands of each spirit, I.e. with vodka, Smirnoff and absolute.... wines, sherries and champagne... also a couple of bottles beers.  You can’t take any drinks out of the lounge though even the soft ones!

Overall, this would always be our go to hotel in Barcelona! Give it a try it has many positives, particularly if you are a platinum or spire elite member as they look after you even more.    There is also a spa available.  Would really say this is a good hote, probably not quite very good, but certainly good....😊. There is also a small grocery store opposite where you can pick up bits and bobs.",4,2017,11,05
12,Convenience and luxury combined,"We spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza Fira Center in Barcelona in a club room.  The hotel is conveniently located near plaza  de Espanya metro station and in a quiet neighborhood. It was nice to be away from all the noisy, touristy type areas.The hotel itself is lovely with a very helpful and pleasant staff.  The bedroom was large with many amenities, and the clubroom was excellent. There was food and drinks all throughout the day, and the breakfast contained an extensive selection of foods, such as scrambled or fried eggs, several types of granola and many cereals, many types of breads, several juices, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.They also provided gluten-free rolls for me upon request. Really one of the best breakfasts we’ve encountered in this type of hotel.  Staying in a clubroom is well worth it and I’d highly recommend this hotel.
",5,2017,11,03
12,Great stay,"I chose this hotel due to central location, also close to airport bus. This place is attached to a convention area, so busy, a lot of business people, plus the tourists and cruise travelers. But front desk was quick and friendly. 

I was issued welcome drink coupons for all 3 of us and then the agent noticed that we had king bed and quickly ordered a roll away bed for us for no extra charge.

We arrived just when breakfast was being closed, but got to see the massive and beautiful spread.

We had a lot of activities planned, so unfortunately did not use pool or spa which looked great.

The room was nice and comfortable. 

Location was great.

We were offered a buy up deal that included lounge, spa access, etc, we declined since we had other plans.",5,2017,10,31
12,Loved it,"Stayed with husband & son. We had a Club Suite which we would definitely recommend. Lots of space for the three of us, nice little balcony to sit out on. Great bathroom with two doors, shower & bath. Nice lounge to watch tv, also a tv in the bedroom if you wanted different channels and a dining table if you ate in the room. The staff were all super friendly & helpful. Access to the Club Lounge was wonderful as it gave us somewhere else to relax after a long day out walking. Breakfast was also served here each morning. Good drinks selection & nibbles daily. Of all the IHG hotels with a Club Lounge that we have stayed in, this stood out from the rest, probably because of the pleasant helpful staff and relaxing ambience. Great rooftop pool and bar/restaurant. Very relaxing to sit and look out over the city early evening. We tended to use taxis with our App to get around the city and found this hotel to be well placed. We would definitely return.",5,2017,10,31
12,Start of my 50th birthday trip,"Love this hotel, the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  All of our needs where met with utmost respect.  I will visit them again for a longer stay in Barcelona. The rooftop restaurant was fabulous.  The food was simply amazing.  The atmosphere and scenery was so beautiful. It was a great way to start my birthday.  I recommend staying at this great hotel. You will enjoy the stay and the city 🌃.

",5,2017,10,31
12,Europe trip.,"I thought the hotel was nice, a good location with helpful staff. I would return and stay here. Options for dinning would be good and extended hours for food and drinks. A pamphlet and/or staff instructing customers on things in the room. What things were in the room, how it worked and if there would be additional charges. ",4,2017,10,30
12,A perfect weekend,"What's not to like? The hotel is a short walk from the metro. As a Spire member, we were escorted to the Club Lounge to check in. Breakfast in the lounge was great. Complimentary Sherry and Champagne (no Cava?) was available in the evening. The upgraded room was comfortable, dark and quiet. El Mall restaurant was excellent. One thing - you really need to replace the lumpy pillows.",5,2017,10,30
12,Convenient modern hotel in Barcelona,"Stay in Club Lounge room -- includes breakfast, helpful staff, afternoon and evening drinks and snacks.  Hotel is 10 minutes from Plaza Espanya Metro station (and train to Monserrat), and five minutes from Magic Fountain.  Rooms sleek and modern.  Club  room includes laundry!",4,2017,10,29
12,Beautiful Barcelona,"We recently enjoyed a four night stay here. The rooms are spacious, plenty of room for the three of us. The bathroom was huge! Great to have a separate cubicles for the loo and shower. Only down side was that whilst there was 3 of us in the room we were never given 3 towels, mugs, glasses etc and had to keep asking daily.
However we celebrated our daughter's birthday and the hotel left her a message and some delicious pastries which was very thoughtful.
The hotel is located close to the metro so easy to get around and there are also bars and restaurants within walking distance. Make sure you have a drink in the roof bar which has fantastic views.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We would definitely return.
",4,2017,10,29
12,Highly recommend,Excellent service. Great location. Spacious rooms. The staff go that extra mile to accomodate you. Location is centeral. Not far from all the attractions/ places to see. Spa is very nice. Will def stay here again,5,2017,10,26
12,Crowne Plaza Fira Center Barcelona,The stay was very pleasant. My only quibble is that the bar measures for the vodka in a cocktail were ridiculously small given the impressively high price being charged for it. The view from the 7th floor bar almost made it worth it.,5,2017,10,24
12,Crowne Plaza - Fira Barcelona,"Excellent experience
Thanks for the upgrade to the Jr Suites, (Spire Elite advantage?)
Good location for our Business Purposes - Congress @ Hotel
Pleasant Club Lounge & hospitality
Nice selection for Breakfast",5,2017,10,23
12,Comfortable stay and ideal location,Came for a two day business meeting and found hotel to be comfortable and very centrally located. Excellent rooms and lovely pool terrace. Nice selection for breakfast also. Reception can get busy at times but staff were friendly and efficient ,4,2017,10,22
12,Good experience in Barcelona,"We arrived in Barcelona the day of the big strike after the Catalonia independence vote.  We were very pleased to learn we'd been upgraded to the Club Floor.  We received great help from the Club Room staff and appreciate them very much.  We were in a suite that was very large and spacious.  Loved it.
2 downsides to this property. First, there wasn't a restaurant where we could get ""normal"" food. I don't always want tapas or fancy gourmet fare.  Fortunately, room service had a different menu.
Secondly, the hotel was a distance from bus and tram access. The flip side of this, however, is that it was quieter.",4,2017,10,19
12,Reasonable Hotel,"It's the usual high-ish standard of Crowne Plaza. Room was clean, well presented. However, best not to go during on- going political strife as crowds of thousands of people banging pots and pans at all hours is hugely irritating.

Try to get a room away from the main road ( i.e not Fira centre side).",4,2017,10,19
12,Review,"My only complaints are that the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.  While there is a cylindrical container of shampoo on the wall of the shower, there is no way to know whether the container is about to run out.  The first night,I did not realize that such a container existed, so used the sample size shampoo, which was never replaced
You need a concierge desk to provide info to the guests when there are long lines of people checking in.",5,2017,10,19
12,Good stay,"The staff at the hotel was very warm and welcoming, especially Ms. Zhou at the Club Lounge.  The rooftop lounge and swimming pool was a nice touch.  And the location was very convenient to various attractions such as the Catalan Art Museum, CaixaForum and the Arenas mall.  And the Moet champagne available daily for breakfast at the club lounge was a very nice touch.  Overall a good stay.",4,2017,10,18
12,Staff are superb,"We had a great stay the staff were spot on at checkin provided us all the information we needed and were friendly.

The hotel is well placed near the fountain and arena with a great roof top pool a d  ar to relax.

The room was spacious with a big tv not that we watched it as were out seeing the sights.

Only thing is in other ihg hotels  i have been nespresso pods are included here they charge 2 euros for them.",5,2017,10,15
12,Fabulous Hotel!,"We spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza and could not have been happier.  The location is perfect and the hotel is extremely modern with all of the latest amenities.  We stayed at five hotels while visiting Spain and this was #1in our book.

Our room was extremely clean and well maintained, the beds were comfortable and the rooms were well sound proofed.  The staff was very accommodating and professional.",5,2017,10,13
12,Super hotel,"Staff were very efficient, thoughtful and considerate throughout our stay. We wanted to experience the museums and gardens of Barcelona and this is perfectly located for such activities with so many places within easy walking distance.",5,2017,10,13
12,Perfect weekend!,"Location, location, location! Just steps away from Placa Espanya, so connection to everywhere! The hotel itself is beautiful. Modern and well equipped, for the business traveler but also for leasure travellers like myself and my boyfriend. We enjoyed more than once from drinks on the rooftop terrace, (drinks for no less than €7.00) you pay for the view. Its incredible! Rooms and service are top notch. I was very impressed overall, spend 3 nights although definitely wishing to stay much longer. Thank you CP!",5,2017,10,13
12,Perfect,"Had a perfect stay. Excellent Spa and facilities, Check in was easy, Being a Spire member I got upgraded to a nice room. Check out took a bit off time. will come back with the family for a long weekend Barcelona. ",5,2017,10,12
12,Week vacation with friends,"From day 1 the crown plaza staff went out of their way to make our stay an enjoyable experience. My husband is an elite IHG member and our room was upgraded to include the club level which included free drinks, breakfast and snacks throughout the day. Room had two double beds and was very clean and comfortable. Hotel is close to the museum of art which is a must see. Close to the metro which is very easy to use to get to other areas easily.",5,2017,10,11
12,Outstanding Stay,"My wife and I spent 2 nights here in October on vacation and had a fantastic stay. At times Crowne Plazas can be a bit drab - but this hotel is one of the best 4 star hotels I have stayed in. We were upgraded as IHG members and had access to the club lounge. The staff were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. Great advice on where to eat, how to get about and fantastic drinks all day.
The rooms were very nice and the beds very comfortable.
Another strong feature is a fantastic roof top  bar and pool - perfect on a warm autumn day in October for a quick (but cold) dip and a beer.
Overall - I would love to come back.",5,2017,10,10
12,Outstanding Hotel,"I'm a frequent traveler and rarely stay stay at Crowne Plaza hotels.  That may change after staying here.  Hotel is in a relatively quiet area of the city, rooms are very comfortable, and there was no traffic noise  (stayed in room 345).  Employees were fantastic.  Great city, great hotel.  I'll be back.",5,2017,10,09
12,Great hotel!,"This hotel is in a great location with friendly staff.

Most of the time staying in a room near the elevator can mean a sleepless night.

The layout of the hotel and double paned windows blocked out all noise from the inside and outside. Great experience at the hotel.",5,2017,10,08
12,Staff Sensitive to needsb,"We arrived during a strike...enough to put anyone off. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Club Level.  While checking passports they noted it was my birthday. Shortly thereafter a chilled bottle of Cava and some delicious cakes arrived with a note wishing me a Happy Birthday. The Club Staff were consistently helpful on tourist and travel arrangement. Because of the Staff's care we felt valued and easily ignored the momentary civil disruptions outside the hotel. 

The hotel location was good once we figured out the transit system. The only negatives I noted was there was no place in the shower for putting shaving and showering supplies - no shelf/ tray etc even though the shower design and fixtures were excellent otherwise. ",4,2017,10,08
12,Superb hotel,I attended a conference at the hotel with over 600 delegates.Hotel is modern and has good facilities.The roof top bar has great views of the city and offers a wide selection of cocktails.There is a really classy glass pool and loungers for relaxing in the sun.,5,2017,10,07
12,Perfect spot - Perfect service,Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights at club floor. What an amazing experience. The staff in the club lounge provide a perfect service. The lounge have really long opening hours and you can go here and relax have a drink and a snack almost any time you wish.Will recommend this hotel to everyone and can't wait to come back.,5,2017,10,06
12,Wonderful Stay!,"Not far form Placa d'Espanya. About a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel.  On the outside it just looks like a nice building, however.. when you open the door, elegance is the word that comes to mind.  Nice, clean, professional.  Checked in, and because of being a spire member, i was escorted to the VIP lounge for check-in. Was able to enjoy the amenities of the lounge as well as easy check in.  Our room was amazing!  It was high enough to see the city and enjoy the views of Barcelona. Comfy beds, amazing, and clean bathroom with separate shower and tub. One TV in the bedroom as well as one in the ""living room"" area. Very close to a couple local eatery places as well as a quick walk to museum to catch the fountain show.  Breakfast in the place is awesome! You will leave satisfied.  Eggs, bacon, fruits veggies, coffee, juices, etc.  You can eat and put yourself in a food coma with the deliciousness of the food.Lastly the rooftop is amazing! Bar and pool with incredible views of the museum and the city Book with confidence!",5,2017,10,05
12,"Great location, proper hotel, friendly staff","This is a proper hotel located very close to the Plaza d'Espagna. The staff are very friendly, and the the overall level of the hotel is quite good. Only downside that the indoors spaces are quite dark, and contrast the sunny surroundings.",4,2017,10,05
12,Pleased,Very clean and well kept hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful when suggesting city tours.  It would be nice to have a listing of restaurants in the area that customers have used that provide good service and food.  Rooms were very nice and spacious.,5,2017,10,05
12,Crowne Plaza Barcelona,"The service was excellent from time of check in to checkout.  Personnel was courteous.   Room was immaculate, spacious and the bedding very comfortable - even providing a selection of pillows.  The bathroom was also spacious and well appointed and there was turn down service and every night.   All in all, it was an excellent experience.",5,2017,10,04
12,Fantastic hotel stay in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in this fantastic hotel in Barcelona. It is, in my opinion, pretty much perfect. I travel quite a bit and have stayed in a wide variety of hotels in many countries. I have a
short list of what I believe makes a good hotel and this hotel has everything I like in a hotel. It
offers a feeling of safety, calmness and quiet in a large, noisy city overflowing with tourists. The rooms
are comfortable and well laid out. The lighting in the room is amazing.The cooling/ heating system was
perfect. I find this a problem in most hotels. We were also able to actually open a window and enjoy 
fresh air. The best feature was not hearing other guests above use/ below us/beside us despite having
a room right in front of the elevator. We also did not hear doors slamming closed-heavenly!
The staff are great- calm, friendly without being effusive, and efficient. The wait staff in the breakfast room were great despite there being throngs of noisy, hungry patrons (there were 3 weddings there
on Saturday night so Sunday morning was riotous in the breakfast room). The room had a kettle,
a Nespresso machine, nice solid coffee cups and, best of all, coffee cream! Oh, and Lindt thins! The hotel is simply quite physically beautiful inside. Not over-the-top; just perfect. We did not
try the exercise rooms, spa or the ""El Mall"" restaurant so I cannot comment on those amenities. The
breakfast offerings were extensive and delicious. How can one possibly not love a hotel that offers
Sacher Torte for breakfast? My favourites were the whole grain/chia croissants, cured meats, local cheeses and quince jelly but there were also traditional bacon, eggs, waffles, pancakes, cereal, at least
a dozen types of bread/ pastries/rolls, fresh fruit, juices,yogurt etc to satisfy a wide range of preferences. The hotel was in a good location.  It was a short walk to the National Art Museum of Catalonia, the Magic Fountain, Playa Espana, and Arenas shopping mall. It is well possible to walk
to the Gothic Quarter, the Sagrada Familia, and the waterfront. We did it (but needed a taxi to get back!).I believe the hotel provided good value for the price. It was, in fact, the least expensive of
the hotels we stayed in on our trip to Spain but provided the best experience. I have stayed in over
30 different hotels in Central America, New York City, the UK, Ireland, the Caribbean, Portugal and France in the past 18 months and this hotel was quite simply the best!

12,Modern Hotel,"We loved this hotel.  We stayed in five during our tour with Collette and this was our favorite.  Our room was spacious.  We could adjust the temperature in the room.  We appreciated the complimentary bottles of water and the use of a refrigerator...oh, and the availability of ice!  The bathroom was remarkably clean, excellent housekeeping services.  The rooftop bar provided stunning views of the city.  The Sagrada Familia was visible in the distance along with the Mediterranean Sea.  The rooftop pool had to be experienced just because it was so unique.  ",5,2017,10,04
12,Great Hotel With Excellent Services,"Our stay at this hotel was for 3 nights; the accommodations were comfortable and roomy, incl. a bath with both shower and separate tub; beds very comfortable; A/C worked great; conveniently located safe and easy to set up.  I especially liked the Business Center which was free to use, which I did for several times.  Registration Desk service was top notch.  Of the 5 hotels we stayed on our tour of Spain, this hotel was the best and most spacious.  ",5,2017,10,03
12,First visit,We stay at this hotel wiyh my family for 5 nights. Sleep material were as a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was normal but includes every taste . Location and staff were both incredible great. Thank u crown plaza fira hotela for nice touch of barcelona.,4,2017,10,02
12,Barcelona hotel for before or after a cruise,"This is a first rate hotel. It's a little pricey but well worth the cost. We had 3 nights before a cruise here. It's about 25 minutes form the airport and about 15 minutes rom the cruise port. We had a club room which included breakfast in the Club lounge or the restaurant. Also there were snacks and beverages all day until 11 PM. Beverages included water, soft drinks, beer, wine and liquor. We had late lunch 2 days and utilized the lounge for the 7:30 to 11 PM hot and cold snacks that were provided. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the art museum and fountains and the hop on hop off bus stop. This turned out to be a great choice in hotels.",5,2017,10,02
12,One of the best hotels in Barcelona !!,"Great staff,  beautiful facility, Fantastic location.  Highly recommend this is the place to stay if you're heading to Barcelona.  Can't go wrong here !!  I've been to Barcelona many times and this hotel is a great place to stay. Central location,  close to metro, beach, city center,  staff unbelievable !!   If you're heading to Barcelona,  this is the place to stay.   Rooftop pool ( beautiful ).  Great restaurant in the hotel.  Large, comfortable rooms with all amenities you could need.    Check it out and you enjoy the place.   Staff incredible !!   ",5,2017,10,02
12,A better than average 'Crowne Plaza',"A very short nightstop in Barcelona found us requiring a hotel within reasonable distance of the airport.
The Crowne Plaza met our needs very well.
A warm greeting at reception & a very well sized standard room made a good impression.
Our only experience of any other facility was a quick drink at the rooftop bar, very pleasant.
Overall a very good quality hotel at a reasonable cost.",5,2017,10,02
12,great accomadtion,"nice clean and modern, well managed and all services very good , nice location and staff very helpful,rooftop pool/bar etc very useful, excellent place to stay with great views of barcelona , would go back and stay again  ",4,2017,10,02
12,Great Modern hotel in good location,"We stayed pre cruise, looking for a good base to experience Barcelona. very friendly and helpful check in staff and a lovely well appointed and spacious room.  Dinner in the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced.  There is a convivial bar/dining area with knowledgeable and interesting staff; and a delightful café on the 7th (top) floor with 360% views of the Barcelona area.",5,2017,10,02
12,Family weekend in Barcelona,I stay in Crowne Plaza all over the world.  This was by some margin the best one that I have stayed in.  The service was excellent and location very suitable for seeing the city.  I will stay there next time in Barcelona.,5,2017,10,02
12,A Haven in the business centre of Barcelona,"This is a very well run hotel where even the lifts are efficient! The reception/foyer area is spacious and staff are attentive and helpful. Our room was large by European standards with a little seating and work area which was welcome. The bathroom had a bath as well as a walk in shower. We found it quiet, despite there being a conference being held somewhere in the hotel - we only saw delegates gather in reception on one occasion. Their rooftop terrace with bar and serving light bites is a nice touch. Their restaurant is very good indeed, way above the average hotel restaurant, and it has a nice ambience with a tempting menu. Parking underground takes away the hassle if you're driving. It's nicely located in the business area which has some good bars and ""eateries"".",5,2017,10,02
12,best stay in Barcelona,"we had a fantastic stay at the Crowne Plaza on our weekend trip.The Club room was ver nice and large and very clean. The Loungs is really great for breakfast and have a drink or snack. The service is excellent and very friendly.
THE best - Roof top Bar and Pool with a fantastic view
",5,2017,09,29
12,Great hotel on the edge the city centre,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of a tour of Northern Spain and Southern France. It was, by far, the best hotel we experienced during the tour. The room (241) was spacious and modern, with twin beds that were large and comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed, with separate shower and bath, and the toilet/bidet area even had a door which is pretty rare.

Breakfast was provided as an expansive buffet with many eastern and western options, more then enough to keep us happy. Coffee from the Nespresso machine was a bit hit and miss, though, due to the small range of coffee types available and the variability of the milk temperature.

Front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful, even arranging picnic breakfasts on our last morning for our 5AM departure.

The hotel is located a couple of kilometres from the city centre. We were told that Barcelona is too large to walk around, but we did walk from the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia on the other side of the city to the hotel, with quite a few diversions, so it's not that far if you're fit. The Magic Fountain of Montjuic (Font magica) is quite close. 

The rooftop bar at the hotel provides an excellent panoramic view over the city.",5,2017,09,29
12,Not in the City Centre but...,"A very comfortable, user friendly hotel. It is in a business area but there are lots of bars and eateries around without the higher prices of the centre...The roof top bar is exactly that with a small pool and beautiful views over part of the city. Only a short stay this time but as transport is good, I would consider staying here again and travelling into town for all sightseeing.",5,2017,09,28
12,over expectations,"Everything was superb, exceeded my expectations. really comfy bed, no traffic noise in the room due to double windows. nice and helping staff. good roof teracce and spa facilities. delicious breakfast, short walkway to metro station, etc.",5,2017,09,27
12,Best hotel in Barcelona :),"The hotel is very modern and stylish. We were upgraded to one of the junior suits, which was absolutely fabulous. The best thing about this hotel is the newly open rooftop bar with stunning view over the city. Very relaxing! I am already planning my trip back to Barcelona and for sure I will be booking Crowne Plaza Fira Center hotel again!",5,2017,09,27
12,Excellent!,"Very modern and luxurious hotel in Barcelona. Staff was very helpful and kind. About a 20-minute walk to La Ramblas and about 45 minutes  to the beach. We stayed in an executive suite and had access to the VIP lounge. Breakfast was excellent as well as the open bar all day. Next time we are in Barcelona, I will definitely take this hotel into consideration. 
",5,2017,09,26
12,Crown Plaza Barcelona,"The Crown Plaza hotel in Barcelona was brilliant, a lot of hotels have a four star foyer and a three star room, but not this one. We had a quiet room except for a little noise from the music festival which stopped after about 11pm, it didn't keep us awake. It was centrally located and close to the magic fountains. Which was brilliantly lit up at night. Worth while going to see. So a great hotel in a great place. Must do.",4,2017,09,25
12,Todd Hotel In City Centre,"Stayed here unfortunately only for two nights in this amazing city. Had a suit with lounge access. Check in and check out in VIP lounge a breeze. Room good size sitting room and bedroom Crowne Plaza quality. Food and drink served in lounge was excellent so was the buffet breakfast. Views of the city from the roof top bar and pool just amazing.. Tourist hop on hop off bus stops five minutes walk away and is a fantastic way to see and get around the city.. Niggles non apart from traffic noise but it is in the city centre, and only two tiny milk pots in the room. Would I stay here again certainly as Barcelona is a city we will return too, so much to see.",4,2017,09,25
12,Attractive hotel in nice neighborhood,"This is a spacious, elegant hotel, with conservative styling, near the Parc de Monjuic.  This is a residential neighborhood in addition to having a bunch of nearby attractions, including several great museums, the ""Magic Fountain"" , shopping, and big hills with parks, views and nice walks, and lots of restaurants.  Downtown is about half an hour on foot, and metro stops about 10 minutes away.  Streets felt quite safe for a single woman.  Room was very nice, with a very nice bath with tub, shower, and bidet.  Service was good.  Breakfast buffet is recommended - very large selection designed to appeal to Chinese and Germans as well as Americans and Mediterranean folks - and good service there as well. ",5,2017,09,23
12,Welcoming and beautiful,"The installation is beautiful and neat, the staff is polite and kind, with their best attitude for assisting you. The loby has an amazing scent that I regret not asking what it was, excellent touch. The breakfast is varied and delicious. The view from the terrace is overwhelming and the swimming pool is beautiful (a bit cold by the end of September). 

I would definitely go back!",4,2017,09,22
12,Outstanding Hotel In All Respects,"Great Staff.
Big Rooms with all the amenities.
Beautiful Exercise Room and Spa.
Delicious Breakfast was included in my stay.
Roof Top Bar With a spectacular view and great ambiance.
Great location. 
Very Accessible to buses and subway.",5,2017,09,20
12,Staying for business? Yes. With a family? No.,"We visited four hotels over our three weeks in Europe, and unfortunately, the Crowne Plaza Fira Center was our least favorite. We were really excited to stay there, but it disappointed on a few levels. Before digging in to the good and the bad, here’s a bit about the location, for anyone else looking to stay here as a tourist.

Location: The Crowne Plaza is located at the Fira Center, which is located right around the corner, perhaps a 7 minute walk, from Plaza Espana. This is awesome, as the Barcelona Airport Aerobus goes right there! For only 6 euros, you can get a non-stop bus from the airport to 7 minutes walking from your hotel. We bought a 4 day unlimited public transit card, which allowed us access to the subway metro and buses. There are just a couple bus lines that stop right outside the hotel. Otherwise, you have about a 7 minute walk to both the green and red metro lines. If you’re looking to do site seeing, the good news is that you can get everywhere with public transit. The bad news is that other than the olympic sites on the top of the hill nearby, you’re not that close to anything. Now by bus / metro, you can get most places in under 30 minutes. If you were hoping to step outside of the hotel to a plethora of cute restaurants, bars, and old school Barcelona, you’re picking the wrong place. We enjoyed the location, as we used public transit to get everywhere. With public transit, it’s almost a full hour to Park Guell, with a transfer.

Good:

Our Suite – We redeemed points for a room, and we used cash to upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite. The suite was great. It was really large, and it had a huge, modern TV. The bathroom, living room, and bedroom were all separated by doors that close, which meant that we could put our little one down to bed and still hang out in the living area. It was clean and large.

Lounge Breakfast – If you have lounge access, either due to IHG status or a paid upgrade, you’ll find breakfast to be quite excellent. In addition to the standard bacon, eggs, etc, you’ll find a great selection of cured meats / jamon, waffles, cereal, muffins, croissants, fruit, cakes, and more. The spread of food was quite extensive, and they actually open up a separate area of the lounge just for breakfast.

Bad:

Lounge Otherwise – It’s stale and cold. You can, of course, get drinks there all day, and that’s a nice perk. However, don’t you dare try and walk out the door of the lounge with a half drank bottle of soda. The lounge attendants, who we lovingly referred to as wardens, will stop you and inform you that it is completely against policy for you to take that drink out. When you come back with something reasonable like, “But we’re leaving for the day, and this bottle of soda is already open…” you may get a response like, “Thank you for understanding the policy, sir!” Okay… We’re traveling with a 2-year old, and I understand that this hotel is aimed at business travelers, but many of us business travelers enjoy redeeming the points we earn and bringing our families on some trips. If you won’t let me leave the lounge with a drink, then at least don’t give me such dirty looks when I bring my child in. At one point, my child was innocently climbing on a chair, as children do, and the attendant came to stop him from doing so. He was just getting situated in his chair… luckily, they did let us use the lounge to get warm milk for our son, but unlike every other hotel we visited on our trip, there is no way to get milk without asking an attendant for it. I wouldn’t mind this, but they often made me feel like I was really disturbing them. I guess I’m just looking for some family friendly understanding. I paid for lounge access. If you don’t want me to take a drink out of the lounge to my room, then don’t make me feel so uncomfortable when I bring my child in. If you don’t want me to bring my child in, then don’t bark at me if I’d like to grab a beer to take back to my room while my son is napping. Okay so family issues aside, this is not a great post-breakfast lounge. The evening snacks are weak, worse than even many American hotels.

Misc Charges on my Bill – When I checked out, there were all these random charges on my bill, like a nightly 40 euro “accommodation charge”  in addition to my upgrade fee. Nobody at the front desk knew what this was, and it was frustrating, as it slowed down my check-out process, when I was leaving at 5AM in the morning.

Using Perfume to Scent Rooms – I’m not sure what they sprayed in our room before they got there, and I’m pleased that after I called to complain, they never did it again. That being said, it literally took DAYS of leaving our balcony door open to get the smell out.

Housekeeping – The actual housekeeping itself was great. They did a very nice job of cleaning our room. However, we were typically out of the room by 9:15AM, not returning until 3PM or so, and multiple times, our room was not cleaned by then.

Conclusion: I wouldn’t stay here again. I often bring my family to business oriented hotels, and we are very respectful of the other guests and do not disturb them. I typically find that hotels are welcoming of families and make us feel comfortable. I paid extra for lounge access, and I was really disappointed with that experience. Combine this with the strong, lingering scent in our room, the delayed housekeeping, and the misc charges on my room, and I’d just pick another place to stay.",3,2017,09,19
12,Very clean and affordable ,"I was really pleased that we booked this hotel.

Yes it’s a typical chain, business type hotel but it was really well priced given some of the other hotels for the same dates and it was great in terms of cleanliness, service and location.

It’s about a ten/fifteen minute walk to Las Ramblas and it’s a nice walk through some of the old town.

The hotel has a really nice roof terrace bar and restaurant with a pool. It is a bit pricey mind with our water bill costing more than the alcohol at dinner. 

The rooms are really large, have good amenities and you get a good night sleep.",4,2017,09,17
12,Great for the price,"Crowne Plaza Barcelona was pretty decent considering this is my first time staying at a Crowne establishment. Stayed  for 2 nights on my last leg of my European trip.  Check in was super fast and the staff was friendly. Room was a nice size, come equip with  the usually coffee, tea, water and small refrigerator.  Bathroom was huge, come with tub and shower which was nice. Hotel has a rooftop bar to die for. It has a 360 degree view of Barcelona. After a long day of sightseeing I would head upstairs to the roof top bar and take in the city views with a glass of gin and tonic.  The bar in the ground level was nice too but the roof was 100% better.   The location of the hotel was perfect, a mall and train was 10 to 15 min walk and hop on and hop off bus stop was 5 min walk away.  My reservation include breakfast which wasn't bad.  Breakfast consist of the usually eggs, bacon, ham, pancakes, waffles, cereal and a array of pastries. They also had freshly squeeze orange juice which was delicious. Overall the hotel was pretty good for the price.",4,2017,09,17
12,Spacious,"I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room.  Typically rooms in europe are rather small and bathrooms even smaller.  I had a lovely well appointed room with king bed large desk, plenty of dresser and closet space, huge tv, outlets available where you need them.  The bathroom was very large, with a  bathtub and separate shower.  Nice towels, good linens , comfortable bed.  decor nice and modern.  the a/c in the room was so quite i didnt even know it was on, that in itself is worth the money.  upstairs on the top floor is a bar and lovely pool area with beautiful views of the city.  the pool is very small but its nice for a dip and a cool off.  the bar offers drinks and light bites, service is very friendly and efficient.  it was one of my favorite places to hang out for an hour before dinner to just relax.  located just off the main drag in a quite neighborhood easy access to metro walk in 5 mins, lots of tappas bars and restaurants located near by easy to walk to .  overall very nice comfortable stay will definitely return.",5,2017,09,17
12,Very good hotel,"Nice room, good bathroom with walkin shower. Nice lounge. Friendly service. 
Also enjoyed the rooftop area, 173. Nice to sit outside with a coffee and we had a very nice tapas evening meal there one night.",4,2017,09,17
12,Perfect,Stayed 6 nights with my Husband.Great location for seeing the whole city.Metro espanya 5 mins walk with links to the city.We were upgraded to a a suite as my Husband is IHG spire elite and the room was spacious and comfortable to relax.The roof top pool and bar was a treat with views of the whole city and the club lounge was one of the best we have used.Excellent service throughout our stay i would highly recommend ,5,2017,09,16
12,A huge disappointment ,We are in the middle of our first trip to Barcelona. .. check in was slow and unhelpful .... this is not a hotel for a family on vacation .. they cater to business people and large bus tours. Breakfast is lackluster and a zoo. Even though there were open tables for two we were shuffled off to an overflow meeting room and seated at a table for six with two business men. They said the tables were reserved. The hotel is noisy at night with people talking loudly at 2 am and first thing in the morning banging doors at 6am. And that is on a Saturday. Stay away from this hotel if you want a nice stay for holiday. ,2,2017,09,16
12,spacious rooms,This was the second time i stayed at this hotel and I was not disappointed. The service from front desk to cleaning staff was great. It's few minutes to the famous montjuic and you can easily walk there to see the colorful fountain show. It's one metro stop to the Rambla and Placa Catalunia. ,5,2017,09,12
12,Great staff and good location,"As always, enjoyed my wonderful, albeit brief stay at the Crowne Plaza. From the moment I walked to the front desk, I was greeted with warmth and welcomed as a frequent visitor (even if it's my first time in Barcelona). The check in staff were friendly and attentive and had a lot of great advise for things to see and places to go to. Breakfast was included and it was just great; huge selection of dishes (cold and hot). Over all a great stay.  ",5,2017,09,10
12,Perfect One Night stay,"We had our last night in Spain in here before flying back to Australia and it was perfect for what we needed.

The property itself is very modern and one of the best (if not the best) Crowne Plaza's I have stayed in. 

Front of house were very helpful and knowledgeable when asked about the surroundings and something that you shouldn't take as an assumption when traveling - all spoke perfect English. 

Rooms were clean and tidy. Separate bath and shower if you fancy a soak in the tub!

A nice touch was the free drink at the rooftop bar when you are a higher IHG tier. 
The only complaint I have is the weather we had when we were up there. Come on guys do something about that will you ;) 

With such a variety of hotels in Barcelona I would recommend this one as location and price category are both very good.",5,2017,09,10
12,Nice place to stay pre cruise,"We stayed here here for 2 nights prior to a cruise. The hotel staff are friendly and check in was quick and efficient. The rooms are nice and well appointed.
This hotel is close to The Magic Fountain and La Rambla.
Would stay here again.",5,2017,09,09
12,Outstanding,"I stayed here 3 nights...and this hotel  is ....great !!
Spacious and clean rooms and excellent hsk service.
Very nice  wellcome  at the frontdesk by Judith(trainee ) also a real nice toproof bar led by  Matteo...thx  for the warm  wellcome and yr skills...topjob!!
Thnx to all of ya....",4,2017,09,08
12,Beautiful hotel,Gorgeous hotel with an amazing roof top patio and pool that overlooks the city. Walking distance to many attractions and to Las Arenas Shopping Centre. The staff are friendly and the hotel is modern and clean. The breakfast is phenomenal.,5,2017,09,06
12,Fabulous Hotel with lots of littel extras,"I would say this is primarily a businessman hotel but I enjoyed my stay here with my family. We're platinum members so were checked in, in their club lounge, rooms were nice a big and facilities were great. We had access to the club lounge which also included breakfast. It was a lovely place with a huge TV, drinks, snacks and free flowing Moet all day. My children loved their funky pool on the roof terrace. And my husband and I enjoyed a cocktail up there while the children splashed around.",5,2017,08,30
12,One of the nicest Crowne Plaza's seen,"Normally the usual run of the mill Crowne Plaza's are more than a little tired looking. This one is modern, clean and well maintained. The rooftop bar was the highlight of the property and it is located not too far to walk to the nearest metro station, Espanya. It is next to the National Place (Museum of Natural Art) and Magic Fountain, both of which are beautiful and spectacular sights to see. Room wifi reception was good and no issues with access.",4,2017,08,29
12,good hotel charged me extra for kids,decent hotel but they charged me for my kids on check in so raised my bill for the stay by about 400 euros. wasn't happy about it but didn't have much choice Michelina the manager basically saw a way to charge more. didnt have extra towels on our first day had to wait for them.,2,2017,08,28
12,Fantastic stay,"This hotel was excellent and we had a very good stay. Very clean and spacious. Really good washroom. Beautiful rooftop view where the pool and lounge was located. As for the concierge, the trainees were so so, but Sandra (I think that's her name) was excellent and very knowledgeable and knows about good service. It should have been a 5 start rating, but I took off one star because half a year ago when we booked through our agent as part of a tour group, we booked two rooms, then a month before our trip, the hotel told my agent that we must have three rooms as they don't allow three adults and a child (of 3 years age) in one room. Honestly, the rooms are so big I didn't see why it was a problem and it wasn't an issue when we stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Rome in the beginning of our trip. That extra room was an unexpected travel expense, as we stayed 4 nights - it ended up being an extra $1100 Canadian dollars we didn't budget for and wished we could have gotten more notice about it.",4,2017,08,28
12,It's time for Barcelona with IHG ,"This Hotel will be perfect hotel in Barcelona if the staff ( receptionists) listen what the guest say and what they want, first when I checked in the receptionist confirmed me how long for my stay and I already informed him that I have 2 reservations (which is 11-14 August  and 14 -16August)and he acknowledged already , but after 14th August my key was not working it's was very annoying have to going down to the reception and get in the queue for getting cut new key... I don't understand that I was told him already that I stay until 16th why he cut the key for me till 14th !! that show me he doesn't listen about my information! The good thing is the Club Lounge!! The lady who always work in Morning shift was very friendly and the best thing is Champagne all day and all evening!!! ",4,2017,08,24
12,Lovely hotel ,"The hotel is situated not too far from the airport, a 5 minute walk from font magica, and it's a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station. Our 
party of four stayed for 4 nights over a weekend. Checking in was efficient and friendly. The rooms were a good size with the twin room offering 3/4 sized beds rather the singles that you would normally be given. Bathroom was clean and spacious with the usual provisions. Breakfast was included and there was a good range of hot and cold foods. The serena spa was a great experience although there is a cost of 25 euros or 15 with ihg membership (ihg is free to join online) There is a superb rooftop pool and restaurant. However - the service here was slow and ponderous. There seemed to be lots of staff but it didn't look organised.  One of the reception staff - Naveed - was really helpful with his recommendation of good restaurants. One of our party had a birthday during the stay and the hotel went to the trouble of organising complimentary cake and drinks. It was a great touch. I would recommend staying at this hotel. ",4,2017,08,23
12,5 night break - sight seeing and watching a Barcelona v Real Madrid match,"Room was very nice, clean and had everything we needed. We ate in the roof top restaurant which was beautiful as we watched the sun go down over Barcelona. The food was delicious and we were served by a very pleasant and friendly waiter called Kevin. The hotel is situated in an ideal location to visit all the sights of Barcelona, only a Very short walk to the Magic Fountain and easy access to the Metro. All in all a fantastic place to stay.",5,2017,08,22
12,Gorgeous!,"The rooms are amazing. A shower and tub, separate from the toilet so multiple people can get ready... rooms are clean and updated. The lobby is vast and multiple facilities centrally located. An absolute gem!",5,2017,08,20
12,with family,"Excellent choice i came to barcelona with family i was debating with couple of other chain  
i am glad i chose this hotel  , Excellent staff, Nice large rooms,clean over all.i paid extra to access the lounge .Good breakfast.",5,2017,08,18
12,Beautiful Barcelona,"We have just returned from a wonderful week in the beautiful city of Barcelona and stayed in the  Crowne Paza - Fira Center, which must be one of the best hotels I have ever had the privilege of staying in.  The bedrooms was large, comfortable with very very clean.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the facilities were second to none.  I would recommend the club lounge and also the spa which was an experience in itself.  We were lucky enough to be able to make use of the rooftop pool which has recently opened.  The hotel and the staff were faultless and I would certainly return.  An amazing experience.",5,2017,08,18
12,What an amazing place!!!,"From the moment we arrived we couldnt fault this place!! We arrived 2 hours early prior to check in due to flight times we got to reception and checked in and the room was ready!! Amazin hotel imaculate to day the least! Rooms are huge and you cannot ask for more 55"" smart tv a/c massive beds that are so comfey you dont want to get out of them in the morning!! The new 173 rooftop terrace is just wow amazing views over barcelona a lovely bar with amazing seating to just relax dine or just hang by the bar!! The lovation is great just 5 minute work from the magic fountains and art museum which i would deffinatly reccomend!! The breakfast i could not fault from sausage bacon egg toast beans mushrooms to chocolate muffins pancakes waffles cerial fresh fruit cofee tea you cannot go wrong well impressed!! The location is great but same as anywhere in barcelona if you want to see the whole of the city your going to have to walk or get taxis, a taxi from the airport was 15 minutes and cost 26 euros to the campnou it was 10 minutes and cost 11 euros to the guadi cathedra about 12 minutes and cost 14 euros you can walk for days here as theres so much to see but if your only there for a few days and dont want to waste anytime taxis are cheap enough!! Deffinatly would reccomend this place its amazing!!!!!!!!!!",5,2017,08,17
12,Faultless!,"Stayed here for 5 nights and cannot find a single fault? Great location, good sized rooms and excellent service.
The view from the rooftop pool is amazing, though it's a small pool the surroundings more than make up for the size.",5,2017,08,17
12,Five stars,"First time in Barcelona, definitely was not disappointed by our choice of hotel. Booked a club room, so check in was up stairs in the club lounge. Friendly and helpful concierge and staff in general.  Great choice of drinks available, and snacks as well.

Bedroom was lovely and large, lovely clean bathroom with plenty of towels and amenities. Great air con and the room was pleasantly decorated.

The hotel is within walking distance of Font Magica, and also has a wonderful restaurant El Mall within it as well.  Breakfast buffet in the club lounge lovely, with lots of choice and even Moet if you fancied it.

Will definitely return to this wonderful hotel when in Barcelona again.",5,2017,08,12
12,Big Room & Good BF,"Pros: 
The rooms are modern and spacious and breakfast is good. The hotel is in good condition as it is new. Room service food, though limited was good. Amenities are good quality. My kids loved the 55 inch TV. Nice amenities - nice lavender pillow spray to help you sleep better. 

Cons: 
The service is a bit odd, as they don't seem to make up rooms till 5 or 6pm, so if  you need water - suggest you buy it, as it won't be replenished soon and they are stingy with the complementary water. 

We stayed at this hotel twice on the way to and back from a cruise. When I arrived, I asked the lobby to send a bell boy to help with the luggage to which I received the response 'He is not around at the moment' and no help was provided. Great first impression...Coming in with 2 kids, some help would have been appreciated. 
The first time we were ""upgraded"", however, we realized this really had very little benefit, as the room is EXACTLY the same. Later we realized that the executive lounge serves snacks at certain hours, but were never advised of this at check-in, hence missed the snacks, later we also found out that this should include - a turn down service, newspaper and ironing of 2 pieces - none were ever done for us - so wasn't much of an upgrade.  Nor was an apology made for missing these. In terms of room service most times, I had to call up and request for things twice as it didn't get done the first time.  

Location of the hotel, does not seem to be a great area - though the magic fountain is nearby. Based on the hotel's advise, I took the metro to FC Barca stadium. Please be careful when taking the metro - I was pick pocketed on the Metro and when I went to the police station - we found that many many tourists had such experiences on the metro. Again - a simple warning which the hotel should have made. Honestly, I would suggest skipping the metro all together, as ramblas and most of the tourist sites are not too far, up to 10 euro by taxi. 

On the return trip we stayed during our anniversary, we were refused early check-in which was previously requested and as an anniversary gift we were gifted a nice card, Water bottle, 6 macaroons and a bowl of kit kat and candies - with 2 balloons (not blown up) in the candies - was very odd and a bit gross to put latex balloons into the candy. The rooftop pool had just opened. The view is lovely, though the pool is rather small.   

Overall, I would recommend this hotel as the facilities are new and in good condition. Honestly, this hotel has potential for a higher rating, but the service is the only thing bringing it down in my view.",3,2017,08,12
12,Attention to Detail,"Contacted hotel before departure to make aware purpose of visit was to celebrate my wife's birthday
First morning a bottle of champagne and buns arrived
Next night at our meal a selection of mini desserts.
Gestures over and above what I had expected.
To crown the trip off they have opened a new roof top bar and pool with fantastic views of the city.
Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone",5,2017,08,11
12,Perfect for us,"Travelled to Barcelona with my 2 children, 13 and 11.  Didn't want a normal beach holiday but wanted a hotel pool.

The rooftop pool was very clean albeit small but not many guests used it so it worked well for us.  The kids loved the pool as it as see through so I could also get great underwater pics.

Well situated near the magical fountain and away from any noise.

I would definitely recommend for any City Break.

",5,2017,08,09
12,Perfect hotel for a pre cruise stay,"We stayed for 5 nights in the club level. As you walk into the holel, there is a nice airy, spacious lobby with a bar and restaurant. Large comfortable rooms have a decor was that was soothing and neutral. . Room air conditioning was great with your own thermostat which kept the room cool day and night. The room was serviced regularly.. Staff were very pleasant and helpful  The club room served tasty food and wine.  The kind and patient concercierge staff were knowledgeable.  There were always taxis outside. The location is in a quiet section, near the museum of art and magic fountain. We were very pleased with our stay there. ",5,2017,08,08
12,The best Crowne Plaza I've stayed in ,"From start to finish it was brilliant.  A good location close to the metro and a reasonable walk to the main areas.  The car park is great as well.  The staff took care of our case as we arrived early and set off for our exploration of the city.  We came back later to check in and were taken to the club lounge as we had booked club rooms.  The staff were fantastic and we enjoyed a drink there with our children and checked in, our case was taken to our room while we were there.  Breakfast was great, exactly what we needed and was also served in the club lounge.  There is a new roof top pool which is small but enjoyable with a great view the bar is also nice with a good selection of food. We had a late check out so returned here after a trip to Camp Nou for a drink and some nibbles. I would not hesitate to stay here again, brilliant !!! ",5,2017,08,05
12,WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"We stayed in a suite and paid extra for the Club Room. It was worth the extra expense because we had a full breakfast buffet in the morning, free drinks for most of the day, and snacks in the evening. The club room also had a concierge who was very knowledgable and helpful. The fitness room was great for a hotel. This was the perfect hotel for the three of us.",5,2017,08,04
12,Could not fault this hotel!,"Would 100% recommend. Not too far from nearest metro, our room came with a beautiful view which could also be found on their gorgeous rooftop bar. Breakfast was lovely and staff were very helpful. The complementary hat and fan was a great touch! 

All around brilliant base for your Barcelona trip!",5,2017,08,01
12,Luxury describes this hotel,"We added a day to our Celebrity Equinox cruise and spent the night at this wonderful hotel in Barcelona. This was the first time we stayed at a Crowne Plaza property and were amazed at the size of the room and the extensive (included) breakfast buffet. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. The location is outside the city center, but a reasonable taxi ride.",5,2017,07,30
12,Highlight of our trip!,"We had a one night stay here before our cruise out of the Barcelona port, and we were so VERY pleased with our stay. We booked a Club level room, and were more than satisfied with how large our room was and how quiet it was, even though we were close to the elevators. We really enjoyed the extra amenities that came with the club level room, and would recommend the upgrade to anyone who stays here! We stayed at a different hotel on our return from our cruise, but were much more satisfied with the VALUE of the Crowne Plaza hotel and will return to this hotel next year when we come back. Thank you for the best hotel experience of our trip Crowne Plaza Barcelona!!!",5,2017,07,30
12,Great location - just renovated!,"I had a great stay at this recently rennovated Hotel next to the exhibition center.

Very friendly stuff, great restaurant. Outstanding rooftop poolbar which is a highlight here.

Rooms are spacious and I even had Nespresso coffee maker in my room (guess it was a club room or so)

Plaza de Espana Metro station is 500m away. Aerobus from the airport is €5,90 going all 5 minutes as well good for return. Taxi is about €29,- 

Ramblas are 4km away. €8 by taxi.

Overall: great experience and I would choose this again but I guess a busy place if there is a exhibition.",5,2017,07,29
12,July 2017 Stay,"Stayed at hotel recently in July (high season) in a Club Level room with King Sized Bed. Hotel located in safe area with great access to public transportation and many of the local tourist attractions for a reasonable cost. The room was large and comfortable with good AC. The bed was very comfortable and the best sleep we had while in Greece, Montenegro, Italy and Spain. Bathroom was good sized also with separate shower/tub and toilet, both of us were easily able to get ready without bumping into each other. Room had a safe that fit a 17"" laptop along with all our other valuables. Desk was spacious (although chair not super comfy) and a large flat screen TV. The Club had nice sitting area w/ snacks, drinks etc during the day. They also had a good breakfast included each day with our room. Staying at the club level provided private check in/out and concierge service in the club. DangXia was VERY helpful and provided a wealth of info that made our time in Barcelona the best possible. Have already recommended the hotel to a couple of colleagues who are traveling in Oct and Nov.",5,2017,07,28
12,Modern and clean,"The rooms were very clean and the decor was modern.  The staff was quick to accommodate our last minute needs and allowed early check-in.  The hotel is near the magic Fountain, Art Museum and Arenas which is an old bull fighting ring turned into a shopping mall which are all in walking distance.",5,2017,07,27
12,Good clean hotel - near The Magic Fountain,"We booked this at the last minute but our normal preferred location is near the Barcelonetta beach / Ramblas. This hotel is out of the way of those but only about a 10 mins taxi ride away. It is near The Magic Fountain (on the same road, a 5 min walk away) which was lovely as we enjoyed the fountain show. A shopping mall is nearby too - again walking distance.

The lobby is large, clean and very relaxing with plenty of seating. The rooms are designed really well and are well maintained. The air con is effective, the bathroom is very contemporary and overall the rooms are really comfortable. The beds and the recliner chair are all comfortable for their purpose. Loved the USB charging points by the desk and the bed for phone / iPad charging - every hotel needs those!! Free fast wifi too was great!

The breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Loved the omelette station - very tasty fresh omelettes!

The only criticism is the spa. The treatments are overpriced for what they are. The therapists need more training to give more effective massage treatments and really disappointed that you had to pay 15 euros to use the spa pool and gym having spent so much on the hotel rooms! This needs to change! No wonder it was empty...total rip off.

The walls of the rooms were thin and you could hear everything next door. The windows are pretty thin too and we were kept awake at night by an alarm from a nearby building / car outside. IHG needs to build thicker / better sound proofed rooms.",4,2017,07,23
12,Return to Barcelona ,"Returned to Barcelona for 5 days to catch up with family who were visiting here as well, excellent hotel, breakfast amazing best omelettes ever! 
The hotel is busy but you would never known that it's so quite, 
Clean and friendly staff . 
Can't think of anything that wasn't right about it. ",5,2017,07,23
12,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for 1 night with friends. Ideal location for airport and also centre of town.   Very clean, excellent rooms (just done up I think). A short stay but couldn't fault it and will definitely use again if visiting Barcelona.",5,2017,07,19
12,Fantastic for business  ,"Top notch hotel with very good service, rooms, business centre and breakfast 

A little out of town but no issue if your not afraid of walking or taking tube

Decent gym and spa

Large selection of continental food at breakfast including Chinese breakfast options",5,2017,07,18
12,Rooms clean and nice.  Looking for food or view very poor.,"Stayed here two separate times.  Both rooms were very clean and updated. We had lunch and breakfast at restaurants. One out of two breakfasts, scrambled eggs were scary, soupy.  Lunch... we ordered pizza and a burger.  Pizza crust was stale (beyond expiration) and medium well burger I ordered was raw and lost appetite.  Even fries tasted out of date.  Looking for a nice clean place to stay, this is nice.  Food wise?  Get a taxi to go else where!",3,2017,07,12
12,Does what it is promised to do,"We stayed one night here and it is in a good location, very quiet just next to the old Fira congress center. The rooms are good, nothing special but the beds are nice, the aircon works and the bathroom is really nice. The breakfast is very good, with excellent orange juice, pastries, eggs cooked for you and a Nespresso machine definitely worth having. A good hotel but for what we paid would not stay again for that price.",4,2017,07,12
12,Best Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed here. Our room and service were outstanding. Location was perfect. we arrived late into the night, room was ready. Breakfast was buffet style with plenty to choose from. Location was walking distance to mayor streets and public transportation. Taxis available at all times. We left after three days to continue or vacation elsewhere but came back for one more night before departure and we were received as old friends would. We will be back.",5,2017,07,08
12,Simply The Best,"I have stayed at the Hotel Crown Plaza Fira Center at Barcelona for 5 days.  The service provided by the staff of the hotel is flawless and is by far the best in Barcelona.  The staff are so perfect that I have nothing to ask for more.  The breakfast is so good that they provided a lot of choices.  WIFI speed is fast.  

The hotel is a gem.  I definitely will recommend this hotel to my friends, relatives and business partner.",5,2017,07,05
12,Excellent Hotel and Stay,"The location of the hotel is very good, it is close to La Rambos. We can walk or take a cab.

The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. The breakfast spread is good. 

The hotel is very clean and well lit. Room service is very efficient.

I was staying with my family in a triple sharing room. Unlike Europe the room was very big and spacious and did not look cramped for three persons.

Only the pool is not working.

I will strongly recommend the hotel.",4,2017,07,04
12,Great Service very restful.,The folks here welcomed us and treated us like family ---in a good way. Breakfast was great and the concierge was very helpful. Not far from many of the best tourist  attractions. We stayed one night because we have been to Barcelona and do not like to redo the same things. First time at this hotel but will keep it in mind for future trips.,5,2017,07,03
12,Another beautiful stay,"This was our second stay here and it was just as pleasant as the first. Rooms are spacious and clean and beds are super comfy. Bathroom is spacious with great lighting for us ladies and also equipped with a blow dryer. The wifi works great throughout the hotel. Staff is pleasant and check in and check out was a breeze. My only complaint is the fact that the have a Nespresso machine in the room, but you have to pay to use the pods. I think coffee should be free in hotels across the board. They offer free instant coffee, but YUCK, really? I'm staying in a hotel, give me my coffee for free. 
Air conditioning works great and that's huge. Wifi works good throughout hotel. ",5,2017,06,30
12,Amazingly marvelous time!,"I was here for Mind Valley trainings to continue my personal growth and I was treated like a queen!! The employees at the lobby were amazing, I invested a little more to have access to the Lounge and it was the best idea!! The most amazing breakfast ever, wonderful, fast and caring service everywhere including: Danxia Zhou, Mohammed, Simon, Ona Tomas, Ana Polo, Kamel Alonane and many more. They were all knowledgeable, caring, and I got tp try 3 of the 4 kinds of pillows!! The room was very clean, the products are great, the venue for the trainings was excellent, comfotable and clean. The food offered at the conferences as well as at the Lounge was very nice.",5,2017,06,26
12,Best Hotel In Barcelona,"We stayed here one night after our cruise. Enric Cugat greeted us at check in , recognized my priority membership status & offered us club lounge access. The hotel is super clean with GREAT amenities in your room. From the bathrobes to the coffee maker its all very nice. The shower & bathtub both were fantastic. After being on a ship for a week it was a very nice surprise. A short walk to many major attractions such as the Lighted Fountain . They are adding a roof pool shortly,. That will just make this hotel more desirable.  The Club Lounge has all . Beer , Wine , liquor , soda , juices , snacks & a big breakfast spread. Even if you have to pay for it , its worth it! . All in all I will highly recommend this hotel & will stay there again next time in Barcelona .  Great place , great location , great staff . Cant say one bad thing . You found the best hotel. : )",5,2017,06,21
12,Best Crowne Plaza I've Ever Stayed In,"I stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions within the same week, as I was transiting Barcelona to both get on and get off of a cruise ship.  I've stayed in a few different Crowne Plaza hotels in the US, and all of them could learn a thing or two from this hotel.

From the first day of check-in, since I have IHG Platinum status, they did their best to roll out the ""red carpet"".  From a personalized thank you letter from the Hotel Manager to the Lindt chocolates received upon checkout, I've never had a Crowne Plaza do that for me before.

Both rooms that I stayed in had modern / swanky, yet highly comfortable beds and decor, compared to the worn out feeling I've had from some US based Crowne Plazas.  The hotel is highly energy efficient, with motion sensors controlling a lot of the lighting.  For my second stay during the week, they were able to accommodate my request for an early check-in (checking in at 8:30am) with ease compared to other hotels.

Regarding amenities, their Club Lounge is worth the Euros if you want free drinks (including decent liquor), free tapas, and/or free concierge style assistance.  Their piano bar in the lobby is very spacious and served by knowledgeable bartenders.  I was not able to try either the spa or the attached restaurant.  Given all of the higher end styling and such, their room service menu was a little bland.  That said, room service delivery was superb.

An active taxi stand is right at the hotel entrance, so hailing a taxi was never a problem.  While the hotel is in the city, it is convenient to the airport (while still being in the city) as well as the cruise port.  Some of the more tourist oriented destinations, such as the beach may be further away and closer to other hotels.

Bottom line: I greatly enjoyed my experience at this hotel and would definitely consider staying here again should I return to Barcelona in the future.",5,2017,06,19
12,club room well worth the peice,"from check in to check out outstanding service.Club room very comfortable with plenty of room. the lounge staff will assist you in any way possible be it tours ,directions or recommending restaurants,the lounge provides snacks and alcoholic beverages .can highly recommend this hotel and will return again.",4,2017,06,13
12,City break,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Whilst not in the main centre of Barcelona, it's in a quieter part of the city, excellent for visiting the main tourist areas.

Room was very spacious, clean and well equipped. 

Excellent value and recommended.

Didn't eat here as close by to some excellent restaurants, and local hipster hangouts.",5,2017,06,13
12,Excellent hotel well positioned in Barcelona,"We booked a lounge room for a few nights prior to a med cruise and it was well worth it. The staff in the lounge were terrific and gave great advice as to what to see and how to get there. The hotel is well situated in town and walking distance to the night fountain and metro stations. The rooms were excellent and the lounge had great offerings of snacks and alcohol, all for free and their breakfast was excellent. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2017,06,12
12,Better than average,"位置離主要的景點有點遠, 但步行到市中心仍可接受, 5 to 7 mins to Metro, few mins to art museum, and next to Montjuic, 仍有時間可行上Montjuic castle 是不錯的體驗, 反正搭cable car有點貴, >20 to 30 mins walk to La Rambla, 舊城區, Market. Staff is overall helpful, i asked them to help to make booking for a restaurant, 二話不說就有禮地幫你, 是有少數職員比較無咁主動. They can speak very good English, room is spacious and comfortable bed, just not really catch well to adjust for warm water for shower, a thoughtful stuff pillow spray is ready for your sweet dream, buffet breakfast is nice. I saw there is a bicycle at the lobby, not sure if you can free use. There is a supermarket but not a big one and several good restaurants nearby, 但留意星期一附近的餐廳可能唔開. Overall is good but considering the location, if you want to walk from the main attractions to hotel, have to pass few quiet streets, i suggest to take taxi or metro if back hotel at night, taxi between La Rambla is just eur8 something.   ",4,2017,06,12
12,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here for 5 nights before a cruise and found this to be in an excellent location The staff at the Crowne Plaza was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The food was excellent and the service in the restaurant impeccable.  I had breakfast in the Club Room each morning and it was excellent, also.  

I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Barcelona for leisure or business.",5,2017,06,10
12,Pre Cruise stay,"Excellent service from multilingual, helpful, front desk agents.  However rooms were merely adequate.  Plentiful brunch at an extremely reasonable price. Air conditioning settings were confusing, called for some help and received none.  Very reasonable rate for the convenience of location to the city, Montserrat any the cruise terminal.",4,2017,06,05
12,Excellent hotel,"I don't understand why this hotel is not ranked higher. The rooms are very large by European standards, its close to the airport and within walking distance of many restaurants and the Magic Fountain. They set up an additional bed for our 3 adult sons who were bunking in the night before a trip home. Ask for the 6th floor for fantastic views and large rooms. Very satisfying stay. The staff could not be nicer.",5,2017,06,05
12,"Amazing hotel, not so great location","Hotel was very high quality. 5* level with a brilliant room and fantastic service. 

Only down side was the location, quite a far walk in to town, approx 25-30 mins. Not an issue during the day but on Friday / Saturday nights (midnight+) the area doesn't feel overly safe. 

The city itself is beautiful and nicely diverse, and the hotel was a very reasonable price. ",4,2017,06,02
12,Quality at a High Price,"Nice rooms - not any better than a Hilton, but the price for room only 286.21 Euro per night is a lot to pay for a hotel in Barcelona. I did not eat there but expect that was at a premium as well. I would say it was not great value for money. Check-in took some time, check-out was fast.",4,2017,05,31
12,Struggling to be a 3 star,"I stayed here for 4 nights for work.  First, although I am an IHG member and was acknowledged as such, I was given a drabby little 2nd floor room facing the noisy street despite the fact that I asked for a quiet room.  When I inquired, they said it these were the rooms blocked out for my company.  Yet all my colleagues told me they got huge rooms on the 6th and 7th floors.  The only good thing is that I think the windows were triple paneled because once closed, the street noise was minimal. But still, when the curtains were open, I felt like the people on the street could watch me – and it’s a high traffic street.

The insides of the rooms are not of high quality furnishings and feel more like a 3 star hotel, if even.  The amenities are minimal– not even files or anything close to a 5-star hotel… and never replenished.  The hotel just felt old and outdated.  The conference area was OK but definitely not high end. 

The front desk seemed nice at first but they did not have a concierge so once you’ve asked them a question more than once, they started to get irritated.  Also, no bell boys. Again, not  a 5-star.

Location was good.  A few blocks away from the Espana metro and a shopping center as well as many restaurants.

I would not stay here again, however, and I did check out and paid less and stayed elsewhere in a nice hotel with a nicer location for my personal stay.",3,2017,05,30
12,Lovely hotel in Barcelona,"Had a great experience here with my boyfriend. We stayed for 2 nights with bed and breakfast. The food at breakfast was delicious - wide range of choice - something for everyone! The staff were friendly. The rooms were clean and spacious. Overall, great hotel! My one criticism is the location as it is quite far away from the nice restaurants and the Rambla etc. But everything you need is within a 30/40 min walk so not too bad! I would go back again!",5,2017,05,28
12,Great Hotel in Barca,"We visited Barcelona for the Grand Prix and decided to stay at the Crowne plaza. We knew we would be looked after, and we were. Very well fitted out, huge reception with bars and a restaurant serving fantastic food.The staff were so helpful, booking taxis, directing us to the City attractions. The room was great, everything included, no problem at all with housekeeping. If you visit Barcelona, try The Crowne Plaza Fir Centre, it's worth every penny.",5,2017,05,25
12,Could have been better,"I stayed here for 4 nights in April with my husband and 8 year old daughter. He is IHG Gold Elite Member, hence for picking this hotel rather than something close to La Ramblas. We had booked a room with 2 Queen Beds. Upon arrival, we were told that we have been upgraded to a Superior/Club room with a King size bed and a sofa bed. When we came back from sight-seeing on the first day, the sofa bed hadnt been made up. As it was already past 9pm, I called the reception only to be told that we weren't in a room with extra bed. Their solution - move to a room with a sofa bed. We had to pack everything, drag it along the corridor and unpack again. I dont expect any compensation as mistakes happen but we didnt even get a proper apology for the inconvenience other than ""Oh sorry the person behind the reception is new and got the rooms wrong"" which left a bad taste! Other than that, our stay was fine. Rooms are spacious with tea/coffee and free bottle of water in the room. We enjoy walking so the location was not a problem for us and we enjoyed being close to Arenas mall.",4,2017,05,23
12,Awesome,"Perfect location followed by really great service from all staff. We really enjoyed our stay in this very modern looking hotel. They've got nice spa and a small wel equipped fitness centre. Rooms are supercomfy and good equipped, very modern. Overall, we will be pleased to visit this hotel again once we are going back to Barcelona :)",5,2017,05,22
12,Great hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in March and it was a very good experience. Staff were very friendly and the rooms were great. Lots of space and very comfortable. Work desk provided lots of room and the bed was perfect. Other facilities in the hotel, such as food /gym, were great as well. Free coffee/tea and bottle of water in the room. For me the only downside was that I only needed to stay there one night.",5,2017,05,22
12,Good for events and tourism,The hotel provides a full convention center and that was the main reason I stayed there. After the meeting I prolonged my visit to Barcelona and I continued to stay at the hotel because it is near many attractions and also the venue is well maintained. ,5,2017,05,21
12,Nice and Not So Nice 2 day stay,"It's a non-smoking hotel which is a plus in Barcelona. It is a nice looking hotel, clean and comfortable. The club room we stayed in was large for Europe although some people might think it's a bit dated.Good hot water. 

It's convenient to walk to some sights. 

Club room lounge facilities are completely a joke. Receptionists in main lobby and club lounge have very little knowledge of computers, how to help tourists or who they are dealing with and don't seem to care. Asked about magic fountain (just around the corner) and received 3 different answers in hotel to when and if it was up and running on Sunday. Asked about how to get to Monjuic Mountain and reception in Club lounge told me we could walk half way up the mountain to get cable car. Are you kidding' we are in our 70's. When I told her to look at us and give another answer she looked at me funny and said ""oh""..Business section not tourist friendly and no one around to help and don't care as well. THIS IS A BUSINESS HOTEL yet totally ignorant of even printing out boarding passes for guests. I eventually did it myself downstairs in the main business center. This is not a language barrier but lack of knowledge and disinterest on their part.

Buffet breakfast in club lounge is soooo bad. I complained two days in a row about cold eggs, hard potatoes, etc. and no one cared or checked to see what I was complaining about. Food that you pay for in club lounge in the evening is sparse and skimpy and everyone complained because other Crowne Plaza hotels had better and much more food. Club Room is expensive and not worth it in this hotel.

Also we came back at 4 pm one day and room wasn't even done yet.

Just remember that all/part of Crowne Plaza hotels are owned separately so that doesn't mean that if you have been to one good one that the next will be the same.",3,2017,05,20
12,Excellent! Very efficient hotel,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for a conference. The meeting space is the most flexible I've seen anywhere in the world, which is a great benefit for a meeting planner. The terrace, or patio, is a huge plus, as it gives natural light to the space. The food is very good. Service is helpful and has positive attitude. 
Registration desk is efficient, and the check in process is fast. The rooms are huge! the bed is super comfortable, very soft sheets and good pillows. 55"" TV. The bathroom is very spacious with a shower and separate tub.
Well located, near to many restaurants, public transportation and there are taxis all day and night in front of the hotel.
Highly recommend it. ",5,2017,05,20
12,Stayed in club room,"oNE OF THE FINEST HOTELS STAYED AT IN RECENT YEARS. STAFF WERE WONDERFUL. ( sorry cap lock on) We even stayed an extra night at the of our journey.
The food free in the club bar was first class  that was breakfast lunch afternoon tea and evening.
All drinks included and staff were constantly opening Moet champagne even at breakfast.
Can honestly recommend this top quality hotel, but stay in the club rooms around 20 euros more but breakfast included so cheaper than a normal room.
with all drinks included and being looked after by great staff what more could anyone ask for.",5,2017,05,18
12,central and peaceful too,"Very well located and very friendly staff
Rooms were large and the Club lounge very useful.
Do see the fountain show nerby on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. Better than Vegas and Dubai
There is a laundrette close by which was very useful too.
Only problem we had was the staff was not very helpful in giving sightseeing information",4,2017,05,18
12,"Quiet, convenient, and comfortable","As Spire Elite members, we were upgraded to a Club Level room.  The room was quite nice and had a window which opened partially to allow in a fresh cool breeze.  The Club was quite nice for breakfast with both ready made offerings, and the ability to order omelets, etc.  The vast variety offered something for every international group of travelers.  Light tapas offered thru the day and wine/champagne always available.  We greatly appreciated the concierge in the Club Lounge.  Each of these talented employees were well versed in multiple languages and extremely helpful in giving subway directions.  Regarding the subway.  There are two stops within a 10 -15 min walk.  This hotel is also very close to the magic fountain.  Looking out the windows of the Club Lounge, you will see a little bakery across the street.  We enjoyed the lovely lady who owned the shop and were thrilled that she wrapped our purchases in foil and placed them in the large baking ovens to rewarm.  Should you visit, look for the 3 cheese in a light croissant type pastry.  Final comment is regarding the business center.  There were several Apple computers available and a printer.  Internet speed was fast in the business center, and not bad in the room.  Overall, we give this property a 4+ rating, and would return again.  If you are visiting Barcelona for the first time, consider adding a Tapas Tour booked on the Trip Advisor site.  It was a great introduction to the city, La Rambles, and the Gothic District.",5,2017,05,17
12,Great Hotel near Magic Fountian,This hotel is very nice and the staff is very friendly. Our room was huge and our bathroom was spa-like with separate tub and walk in shower. The staff was very helpful with directions and the hotel is only two blocks to the magic fountain. The metro and hop on- hop off bus stop are a short walk away. We had a lovely dinner in the hotel restaurant. I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza again when in Barcelona. ,5,2017,05,17
12,"Great location, friendly staff, big rooms!","Spacious rooms, Modern facilities and comfortable, the stay was very pleasant. Breakfast and dinner service were faultless each of the 7 days of our stay. Staff were always friendly and helpful with plenty of tips on places to visit and things to do. Will definitely be our choice of hotel when we return next year!",5,2017,05,13
12,"Excellent Staff, Wonderful Stay","I had booked through IHG for Club Room from 29/4/17 - 03/05/17 with breakfast.

Both my husband & I were just ecstatic at the size of the room & the facilities that was included.  Size of room was almost 2 standard room, huge bathroom, had a bath with a separate shower & separate toilet. Access to the Club lounge offers all sorts of complimentary drinks from soft drinks to hard liquor, snacks like sandwiches & finger food twice daily with tea & coffee available (though the room also had tea & coffee facilities).

Bed was huge & very comfortable, nothing to fault on their cleanliness & upkeep of their premises. It is in an excellent location (out of the crowd), 5-7mins walk to the magic fountain & museum, 10mins to the Plaça d'Espanya with the old bullring turned into a reasonable size shopping centre where you can find a food court in the basement, supermarket, clothes & other essentials to while away the afternoon. There's also a drop off laundromat at the shopping centre.

Staff had excellent attitude & very helpful. No fuss check-in & check-out. As our photos are in the camera, am unable to submit any at the moment.",5,2017,05,10
12,Love this hotel,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza in a Club room for 9 days while exploring Barcelona and surrounding areas. Came off a cruise ship before heading home to Australia. A little out  of the center of Barcelona but close to Plaza Espanya, Montjuic and the Art Museum. The staff in the Club Lounge - Danxia, Valeria, Adria and Ona were wonderful. Especially Danxia who checked me in and gave me such helpful advice about the hop on hop off bus. The hotel is similar to Crowne Plazas all over the world but feels very safe if travelling alone. The room was huge - great bed bathroom and view, Food and drinks in the lounge a real plus if travelling alone. Loved the spa - well worth 15 euros to chill out before a long flight.All in all I loved the hotel and it's staff!",4,2017,05,10
12,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Just steps from the magic fountain, very spacious rooms, unbelievable breakfast spread in the VIP lounge! Complimentary alcoholic beverages and snacks round the clock. Staff was very helpful during a medical issue as well! Great experience staying here.",4,2017,05,08
12,Memorable stay,We stayed in the CP for a long weekend for my birthday. We stayed in a suite (2 separate areas to sleep in great for a teenager) .We also had access to the executive lounge. This made the stay extra special especially with Moët on tap! The hotel is not far from the airport and close to the Metro and beautiful Montjuic palace. It's in a peaceful neighbourhood. The staff at the hotel are so friendly and helpful. We would recommend this hotel if you want to have a break in Barcelona. ,5,2017,05,07
12,Excellent hotel.,"This is in every way a luxurious place to stay with nice, large rooms, professional service, a beautiful pool etc. On the other side it is the same as every where else in the world. That means that in this superb city there are other, more traditional or typical places to stay. Also the breakfast was good but a bit under the standards of what you would expect but in summary it is not a bad choice to make if you stay here.",4,2017,05,07
12,Good place to stay,"We stayed in September 2016 for 3 nights. It was a typical business hotel. Hotel was in modern atmosphere and good maintenance. Room was huge, clean and bright. Especially, recline chair in the room was very comfort. Breakfast buffet was not fantastic but good enough to enjoy. It is located at a distance from city center and the nearest subway station is in 10 min. walking distance. It took around 10 min driving or 20 min subway to get city center.",4,2017,05,05
12,Great Stay,"This hotel is very clean well managed and the staff is amazing. 

Side note. You must slide you card in to the slot just in the door to get any of the room lights to work. 

Menu was great a d location is perfect ",5,2017,05,05
12,More of a business hotel,This property is set up to cater to business travelers. You'll see airline folfs in the dinning room and a business office right of the main lobby. It's not your classic hotel. It's very modern and the rooms are quite sterile but have a very nice feature of both a seperate shower & tub.,4,2017,05,04
12,Club A deal is an excellent value,"The Crown Plaza Fira is an excellent value for location (5 minute walk to the Plaza d'Espanya metro stop), a wonderful place to stay if you love to walk/jog/run for exercise on the beautiful Montjuic trails. The rooms have refrigerators, which I have not encountered in European hotels. We were a group of 5, and found the breakfast and happy hour to be an excellent value.  The breakfast had about 40 items to choose from.  The Club A happy hour was great for we Americans to grab a drink and a snack while we awaited a suitable time to depart for dinner.  Staff were courteous and solicitous. I will stay in this hotel from now on if I am every lucky enough to return to Barcelona. Free Wi-Fi was another welcome amenity. Many excellent restaurants in the vicinity.",5,2017,05,01
12,Never Again,"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel for my honeymoon recently. Overall terrible experience, would suggest everyone to avoid this hotel.

Location: 10 mins walking distance to metro/bus stop for buses to the airport and a few sightseeing spots which was ok

FO: a trainee escorted us to the Club Lounge for check in as we booked a Club Room. We didn't see any bellman when entering the hotel, and it seemed that our luggage (total of 4 pcs) was totally invisible in the trainee's eyes. He didn't try to help or even ask, very unhelpful and first impression was bad.

Housekeeping: TERRIBLE. We found some stains on the toilet seat when we enter our room and immediately called the operator. Took over 15 mins for a staff to come, she didn't speak English :( She could also see the stains and from her body language I assumed she would come back to clean it but this was not the case. We had to clean it ourselves at last when we were back to hotel after dinner, just don't bother to wait again!

Cleanliness: In addition to toilet seat stains, tea/coffee stains could also be found at the bottom of the cups in-room. Desk & chairs in the balcony were covered with dust, feeled like the room had been empty for over 1 month 

Room: The air-con went out of order in the midnight (~2:30am) in the first night. Took over 15 mins again for a staff to come, and we had to call the operator twice to make sure someone was coming. Turned out the air-con could not be fixed and we had to change our room in the midnight, how wonderful! Again, the staff didn't bother to offer any help (no try, no asking) for our move, just leave the keys and leave. 

Club Lounge: We went there 2 times for night snacks, the tables were always uncleaned as the staff only took away the empty plates without cleaning the table itself. Also, staff was very inattentive as plates/forks/napkins were always in short supply. No one filled them until someone asked them to do so. 

Breakfast at Club: could not agree to other comments here saying the selection was huge. I would say it was limited and water in the hot water bottle was cold when we arrived at 9am. Very limited selection of hot food especially.

Check in/out: quick but it was odd to send a manager to greet us upon departure to apologize for the air-con issue on our first night. I can see many alternatives to show their concern for guests during the stay but they chose to do it at end of our stay, not sincere at all. Staff helped us to change the room didn't mention it intentionally but we found out ourselves later that the new room was a upgraded one - maybe they thought we should already be thankful for that?

For people going there to celebrate: saw other comments about surprises organised by the hotel - do not assume it to happen as the staff congratulated us upon check in (we were on honeymoon and we mentioned it in our preferences prior to arrival) but nothing had been arranged. Don't get me wrong, understand it is not a must but it's super odd to congratulate us in that way

I tried hard but I could not find any positive part of our stay with this hotel at all. Overall, staff was inefficient, inattentive and not helpful/welcoming. Level of cleanness was not satisfactory. Was a fan of IHG but this hotel is definitely on my black list",1,2017,04,28
12,Perfect Hotel,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in Europe. Rooms are large and very clean.
During my stay, Atletco Madrid team was staying in for their match vs. Espanyol.
Staff are very friendly.

Hotel is very close to
Magic fountain (4min)
Placa Espanya (7min) from which you can take trains to Monteserrat
Bus station (2min)
Metro station (7min)

Also two markets are there in front of the hotel.",5,2017,04,27
12,International hotel with exceptional service,"Built for the Olympics, the Crowne Plaza looks like many international hotels...what is different is the service...we appreciated the genuine interest every staff member showed in making our visit to Barcelona wonderful.  From check-in to the concierge lounge host, to the restaurant staff, each person went beyond the usual level of good service.  The hotel was pristine clean in every space and there is an excellent gym open 24 hrs daily. Hotel is well located, too, for touring.  We would definitely come back to the Crowne Plaza.",5,2017,04,26
12,Easter break,"Stayed here for a week, great hotel, staff are so helpful, nothing is too much trouble, a lovely surprise for our anniversary on arrival, a beautiful bottle of fizz and macaroon!!! ( my favourite) Maria on the desk was amazing! Don't hesitate 😍😍",5,2017,04,20
12,Wonderful hotel,"From the minute we walked into this lovely hotel, we felt relaxed. The staff are friendly and helpful. The club lounge is well worth it, coffee and drinks at hand whenever you feel like it. Breakfast is very good and there is a huge selection. The hotel is situated very close to metro stations, the metro is so easy to use. We reported that our pillows were too hard and within 10 mins we had softer pillows brought to our door.",5,2017,04,19
12,Trip to Barcelona with an added bonus,"I booked three nights over the Easter weekend for my husbands birthday surprise.

This was our first time in Barcelona and found the staff very helpful with advice on getting around.

The hotel is near the magic fountains and central for bars and restaurants.

I booked breakfast and this had a huge variety of choice, good quality of food and again very friendly and helpful staff.

Our room was a double room with two double beds. The room was large and the bathroom too with free fair trade toiletries. There are tea and coffee making facilities which is great for the first night but the tea/milk was not replenished after the first morning. The main fault we found with the room was the quilt was far too warm and the air conditioning not cool enough which did affect our sleep. 

Our added bonus was Juventus football team stayed Tuesday night in readiness for their match tonight with Barcelona in The Champions League. The team members we met were friendly and really made the stay exciting for us all.

Overall the hotel is lovely and the staff clearly enjoy working there.",5,2017,04,19
12,Just perfect ,"Lovely hotel with outstanding clas .We booked breakfast,it has variety choices ,freshly cooked omelettes the way you wish ,lots of deserts ,healthy options ,easily you can miss your lunch after this lovely breakfast ,room is huge,bathroom is just perfect ,you got wet shower room,bath ,nespresso coffee machine ,kettle in room,Lindt chocolates serves daily basic to your room,very clean ,definitely deserves 5 stars !!!juventus player was also staying in hotel ,we got to see juventus team bus outside hotel ,lots of people taking pictures;)it is outstanding hotel ,metro is 8 minutes walk ,nice little places for eat around the area ,just a prefect stay!!",5,2017,04,17
12,The girl done good,"My girlfriend booked this hotel as a surprise weekend away for my birthday over the Easter weekend. The hotel itself is ideally located close to where the action is, on its doorstep is the magical fountain a tourist attraction itself and within walking distance of placa Espanya which has its own metro station connecting you to wherever you want to go in the city. Also within walking distance is the Montjuic olympic park and stadium well worth a look and just beyond is the Montjuic castle. For those who don't mind a good walk (probably about 20 minutes away) you'll find the marina and Barcelona's beaches. All in all the girl done good, picked a lovely hotel in an ideal location close to many of Barcelona's attractions. The rooms are spacious and well equipped would thoroughly recommend to anyone wanting to visit Barcelona. Slight negative is that the iron is bordering on pathetic, bring your own. ",4,2017,04,17
12,Very good experience ,"Stayed at the hotel a couple of weeks ago with my wife and daughter. First feeling you get walking in to the hotel is of a calm, relaxed, luxurious place. Staff are friendly. Stayed at a club suite which is wonderful. The club lounge is great. 
Best location you can ask for, right next to the magic fountain and Spanish village. We walked for 20 minutes to get to the Ramblas. 
On a personal note, we arrived a day after my birthday and it had gone unnoticed...could have been nice to get that extra personal touch.
Nevertheless, highly recommended.",5,2017,04,15
12,Lovely hotel  and good customer service,"We chose this hotel as reviews mentioned that the rooms were spacious and we were three adults. Plus there was a separate bathroom (as opposed to a screened off area) essential for a teenager travelling with her parents. 

The hotel is very well appointed with good facilities. The room was spacious and the bed was huge. Our daughter had a double sofa bed which was comfortable.  There were the usual range of toiletries which were fair trade and very nice smelling! Housekeeping didn't seem to appreciate that there were 3 people in the room and didn't always leave enough supplies for 3 and one day we did ring down for more which were quickly supplied. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on this aspect 

Location-wise it is out of the main city centre and more towards the business area. The only downside of this was the number and range of restaurants particularly on a Sunday & Monday when quite a few places were closed. We used the metro to get to and around the main city centre. There are 2 stations about 5-7 mins walk away and it  was very easy to navigate around. On the plus side the hotel is very close to the Magic Fountain. Unfortunately, although we stayed in April the fountain show was still on the winter hours so when we ventured over at 9pm there was nothing to see!

We used the hotel spa one afternoon for a couple of hours and for about half the time we were the only ones there. It cost €25 to use the spa but if you are a member of the IHG loyalty programme this reduces to €15. We joined the afternoon we went & got in on the reduced rate. There were lots of jets/ different features to explore although I was the only one to do the bucket of cold water and cold plunge pool properly! Children aren't allowed in the spa area.

We did have one small niggle during our stay. There was a football school staying with numerous boys probably aged about 8-12. Many of them seemed to be in the rooms near us. Unsurprisingly it was noisy at times and we had a couple of of calls from them during our stay. We mentioned this to reception but as it was only had one night left it seemed more hassle to move rooms. On checking out the hotel took some money off our bar bill and offered the use of the club lounge until we were ready to leave for the airport. A small gesture but it was appreciated.

We hope to visit Barcelona again one day and would consider staying here again.
",4,2017,04,13
12,Very large room and in quite location,"Excellent room size in city of Barcelona with large shower cubical, the club lounge is excellent with free flow of Champagne all day, the staffs service is friendly and attentive to the request. 

Location is at a good neighborhood with good selection of restaurants and cafe, also near to Placa Espanya",4,2017,04,11
12,Good business hotel,"Had a good stay at this hotel. The food was excellent especially the breakfast wit a huge selection.  
The room was good. One small gripe was the number of power sockets were not adequate and none near the bed. 
Location is quite good. 
",4,2017,04,07
12,Overnight stop,"Great hotel - good food and nice gym. 

Gym has technogym brand equipment 
- 2 treadmills
- 1 elliptical 
- 1 step machine
-1 recumbent bike
- 2 Swiss balls
- selection of dumbells from 4kg to 12kg I think 
- water and towels 

Clean, very nice situated gym in the spa on -1 level. 
",4,2017,04,04
12,Superb Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend birthday treat and must say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at.
From the moment we arrived we were made to  feel very special and upgraded to club level. We were greeted by two very friendly club hotel hosts who gave us a splendid and detailed information on our club level status upgrade and what that provided. We were given all the local information, transport tips and best Catalan restaurants to eat in.
This level of service continued right the way throughout our stay.
Club level access is superb with your own lounge providing branded beer, spirits, wine  including champagne at no cost. You also have regular refreshed finger food hot and cold.
Breakfast was also part of the upgrade and provided again in the club level lounge.
Breakfast was excellent proving good selection of hot and cold selection. You also could have Moet champagne.
Room was fantastic huge, comfortable and had everything in it. This hotel is bright and modern and kept to an aceptional standard.
We used the taxi service both from and to the  El Prat airport and cost average 25 euros each way.
Metro is a little confusing to start but easy  once you work it out and there are good value ticket options available.
Our highlights were:
- the magic fountain.
- Camp Nou. 
- harbour and beach area.
- little side streets off  of Los Rambles,
- local Catalan restaurants.

We will be revisiting.",5,2017,03,31
12,Very good ,"We stayed for 3 days.
Clean and spacious  rooms.
Friendly staff and professional.
Breakfast  was good however the safe food was served for 3 consecutive  days.
It would be better if they have more variety.
Besides that stay was very smooth.",4,2017,03,31
12,Another excellent stay,"My wife and I paid a return visit,staying for 4 nights in a Club room. Again a very efficient and personable check-in at the Club lounge. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The club lounge facilities are excellent. The staff on the club lounge desk are very engaging and professional. It was my birthday during our stay and when returning from a day out, the staff had left some very nice cake in the room, which was a thoughtful gesture as they had noticed my birthday cards. I have no hesitation in recommending the Crowne Plaza, and look forward to another visit.",5,2017,03,30
12,Just ok,"We visited over our honeymoon. My husband is a diamond member with IHG, Hilton, and Marriott. Consequently we can easily distinguish ok service from excellent. When we initially arrived we were not asked for assistance with our bags or greeted by the bellboy for that matter. We were welcomed by the front desk and upgraded to a suite because of my husband's status. However we were told we would have to wait until morning to see if we would be granted lounge access as only spire members recieve access and the manager was unavailable to give permission. It was astounding that they were unable to resolve the situation on hand at 600 in the evening and had to wait until morning to speak to a member of management ....
We were finally granted lounge access at no additional cost. The food in the lounge is the same every day. They do utilize leftover food from breakfast for a option at dinner. Also dinner options were the same several nights in a row. We have yet to see this at any other hotel we have stayed in. Furthermore, I did see the operations manager taking liberty to sample most of the food before it came out. 
Our room was on the part of the building that was adjacent to construction so we would wake up early am to construction every day. The staff was kind enough to move us to a different room only after our key card did not work x 3 times. ( Took us 45 min to get to our room.)
Overall only ok. Good enough if you are staying one night but anymore than that would recommend a true 4 or 5 star hotel.",3,2017,03,29
12,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights and really can't fault it. The location was great - just a few minutes from the Magic Fountain and Placa Espanya where you can get a bus to anywhere in the city and the open top sightseeing buses. The rooms are fabulous - very spacious, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice from hot and cold food. The bar area was comfy and the restaurant food was delicious. Staff were knowledgeable about the area and very helpful - we were able to leave our luggage all day on the last day as our flight wasn't until 21.35. There's a taxi rank right outside and we found them very reasonable. There are a few nice restaurants within a couple of minutes walk. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return in a heartbeat. ",5,2017,03,28
12,Excellent Hotel,"Probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped. Cleanliness is way above the average standard. The breakfast is excellent, with a wide selection of hot and cold dishes. Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,03,26
12,Birthday Trip,"My partner booked this as a birthday surprise for myself being a GOLD ELITE IHG member we like to stay in the IHg properties. 

Check in was fine,  the lady who checked us in explained we had been upgraded due to being members,  although we initially were not offered drinks or points, we later went back and asked what we wanted and the man said we have had the points added on well, we didn't want the points and we didn't get the choice,  so we got given our two drinks,  there wasn't much choice in the bar during the day as the main bar wasn't open.

Our room was lovely,  very spacious and just what we needed although it was a shame we were woken up every morning to kids screaming and running around the school playground just outside our window.  Would have been nice to not have had that - upon check in we were asked weather we wanted the second floor or sixth floor - well my partner had set his preferences before we arrived and clearly these were not seen. 

The main hotel bar is lovely - very calming and relaxing environment.  We had the same person all our holiday who served us and he was very kind.  I asked for a bloody Mary but not to spicy and it was perfect. 

We wasn't very sure about the spa as we had seen somewhere in the room we had to pay for the spa entry. (all hotels i have stayed in the spa i included)  we went to reception and i asked if we could use the spa - to her response,  yes as member it only cost  30 euros for you both each day!!! 30 EUROS EACH DAY!  i was shocked and claimed we did not know this if we did we would not have booked this hotel.  She then proceeded to take me to her computer and prove me wrong by showing me where on the website it said this - now we didn't book on the website we booked via the IHG app and the message was not on there.  She had to go to the hotel home page and then click on the spa and then click on spa treatments then price list and then it showed you the price to enter the spa.  If your going to charge make it easier for people to see.  I was gobsmacked she took her time to prove me wrong - i work in a hotel and i would never do that with a guest.  I just expected a sorry.",4,2017,03,26
12,Nice hotel,"I stayed for one night and many things were great. The room was big and in a good shape. The TV huge, staff friendly and breakfast rich. I was very happy but did not sleep well... the aircondition did not cool down the room and the room was too warm...

Nice hotel but a bad night.",4,2017,03,23
12,Great location,"If you want to be in the heart of the tourist area forget this hotel. From its proximity to the exhibition centre I'd say this is more of a business hotel.
However, if you'd like to experience some genuine Catalan culture this is an amazing location. Numerous tapas bars, where you'll probably be the only non native, and two bakeries  right across the street. Heaven for any foodie. 
Don't worry about the location, it's 7 minutes walk to the metro and you can be most places in 30 minutes.

Not forgetting a very warm welcome from the staff and a beautifully clean and well kept building. It will be my first choice when I next visit.

If you're staying in the hotel rather than venturing out then invest in a pass to the club lounge. 1st class breakfast and plentiful refreshments all day and evening.
If you want any tips on where to eat just ask.",5,2017,03,21
12,Wonderful Hotel,"Outstanding SAFE location near Metro/underground subway, hop on/hop off sightseeing tourist bus, etc.

Immaculate interior, comfortable rooms, very relaxing club lounge for Executive level room guests, which includes private conceirge, wines, snacks.

Will definitely stay there again!",5,2017,03,14
12,Smart Modern Hotel with huges rooms,"When I booked this hotel, I was a little worried that it was out of town a little, but I was convinced by a very good price (for this quality of hotel) and reports of large comfortable rooms.

The price was good and the rooms were indeed larger than the norm.   The service was friendly and efficient and the food (I only had breakfast) was very good.

Despite my initial doubts, It was the location that impressed me most.   The hotel is very close to Plaça d'Espanya and this means two things.   Firsly you are very close to a major interchange for the metro, so if public transport is your thing, it's very easy to get around and secondly you can easliy take a walk in the olympic park.   Its a really nice part of the City which I hadn't really seen before but will definately be back for a leisure trip.",5,2017,03,12
12,Stranded in country....bad situation but appreciated it!,"Due to health issues, my husband was hospitalized in Barcelona for 31 days...we had started out at the Crowne plaza and after my husband's injury/illness, I stay here the whole time.   The staff was accommodating and supportive!  They helped me so much just being there as well as making sure I had a room the whole time.  We said we would come back in better times.  We are planning that now?",5,2017,03,11
12,Amazing,"Very nice Hotel, staff are very welcoming, room was beautiful very clean.. room was cleaned everyday.  We dined in the restaurant once whilst we were there, food was delicious. .. when we travel to barcelona again we will definitely be staying here again.",5,2017,02,28
12,Great Hotel,"The rooms are big(about double normal size), really nice, huge bathrooms, and the AC is great. The location is good, lots of restaurants and things to do within walking distance, and we had great views of the mountains(even a peek of Sagrada Familia). I would have expected to pay double for the quality we got.",5,2017,02,16
12,Excellent hotel but lacking emotion,"I stayed here twice within a month. I really enjoyed my stay both times. It's an efficient modern hotel that is perfect for business. Good-sized rooms with excellent facilities, decent breakfast, nice bar. It's not so well located for tourism and is in a very quiet area, not really somewhere for a romantic weekend, but a good hotel at a decent price.",5,2017,02,14
12,Amazing hotel ,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for three nights and it made our trip really special.
The hotel is about a 20 min walk from the centre of the city, but only 5 mins from the Metro.
It is absolutely lovely, we were given a massive room, that was well stocked. The bed was huge and very comfortable.
The staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble.

We had access to the executive lounge through the IHG loyalty scheme for free which was a nice bonus.
I would recommend this hotel, it's in a good location, it is comfortable and the staff are lovely.",5,2017,02,13
12,A very fine Hotel in a good location,"This is a very nice Hotel with an upmarket feel. All of the rooms are to a very high standard and the conference facilities are extensive and excellent.

The location is a little away from the beach are, however it is next to the hill with the Olympic Stadium and other monuments.",5,2017,02,08
12,Nice hotel & lovely time ,"We spent 5 days in this hotel, well located only 15min from the airport and close to metro stations.. and not far from plaça d'espanya. Easy To get to the animated place of the city only few minutes with metr. Or taxi !!
The personal are very friendly and nice we had the possibility to access to lounge club which is very nice fine food and nice bar and i would like to thank Marc from the guest relations of the club for his helpful advise about the places to visit and restaurants where to have good tapas yummi !!! He is a very professional and nice person we feel like a family spirit, and we will definitely come back to this nice place again :) 

Thank you for everything and hope to see you very soooooon :) 
Muchas gracias ",4,2017,02,06
12,Great hotel for a Barcelona city break,"Me and my partner spent two nights over a weekend at Crowne Plaza Fira Centre and we were certainly not disappointed. Whilst choosing a hotel, we were stuck between choosing this Crowne Plaza or the Hotel Indigo and I'm so happy we chose CP.

The hotel itself is well located; literally down the road from the Magic Fountains and the National Art Museum of Catalonia. Access to the hotel from El-Prat Airport is easy by either Metro or bus straight to Placa Espanya. There is also a large shopping centre here too with a supermarket.

Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite due to our IHG Platinum Elite status and given two free drinks vouchers in the bar. The receptionist was great and built good rapport with us during the check-in process.

Staying in a suite, we had access to the club lounge. This space was fantastic - certainly the best club lounge I have used in a hotel. There is an array of complimentary drinks; from soft drinks to beers, wines, juices, spirits and even champagne! In addition to this there was fresh snacks, cakes and lunch/evening snacks prepared throughout the day by the cook. Unlike other club lounges, this is all provided throughout the day rather than for just an hour in the evening. In the morning, there is a breakfast room in the lounge which has a great selection of items ranging from hot foods to pastries and fruit. We did not add breakfast to our booking but this is provided free to guests with access to the club lounge - perfect! There is a member of staff at the doors to the lounge to keep track of who uses the lounge, greet guests and restock/clear up.

Our junior suite consisted of a large king sized bedroom, lounge, meeting area with dining table and a large bathroom. There were two massive TVs too. The bathroom had a walk-in shower, a separate bath, segregated toilet and bidet and large sink with premium toiletries from The White Company. The bed was massive and comfortable which made for a great night's sleep. Even though we were situated on the first floor overlooking the road outside, the glazing and black-out curtains meant that we could barely be disturbed by the traffic outside.

On our first night, staff left us a bottle of Cava, water and a chocolate cake in our room as a gift for my partner's birthday which was fantastic. They even wrote a birthday card which was nice of them. A turn down service is available for guests and staff left us biscuits - again, such small details which show the great level of service here.

The service in this hotel is extremely good. All staff members we interacted with within the hotel from the receptionists to the lady who prepares the food for the club lounge were polite, friendly and willing to go the extra mile for us which I appreciated.

After checking out, we spent some spare time in the spa. This spa operates independently from the hotel so access is not free. IHG Rewards members get 25% discount at £15 per person. The facility consists of a salt water pool, loungers, heated loungers, experience showers, ice bucket, solarium, steam room, sauna, pebble walk and treatment rooms. The staff in this spa were not as good as the hotel and barely spoke English. They were very resistant in providing towels - something you would expect for £15... which certainly helped seeing as we had checked out and did not have ours to hand. Generally, the spa is good and looks impressive but when it started to get busy it was not enjoyable. A group of teenagers came in speaking loudly and pushing every button which was annoying. Still, it was a good way to kill time before our evening flight.

When I return to Barcelona I will definitely book to stay at Crowne Plaza Fira Centre again. The location, facilities and service are outstanding and made our stay great. I would recommend anyone looking to book here to go for a club room or higher so that you have access to the club lounge - this is great value seeing as all the club lounge drinks, food during the day and breakfast is included here.

Thank you to the staff for a great stay!",5,2017,02,06

12,Felic Any Nou!,"Overall, enjoyed our stay here.  On the plus side, it was near the main celebration area to watch the New Year’s fireworks.  The triple was rather large with plenty of space for everyone to move around and store luggage.  The beds, pillows, and bedding were definitely comfortable.    

I love that the bathroom had a bidet, which was a first for the other members of the party to use.  The water pressure in the shower was great.  Did not get to use the separate bath.  They provided plenty of mini toiletries, including a large dispenser of their hair and body shampoo.

We slightly had a problem trying to keep the room a bit cool without opening the windows and letting in gas exhaust to enter.  Another peeve about the room was the TV automatically turning on at 08:00 AM when no wake up call or alarm were requested or set.

Another interesting feature is the Nespresso machine.  However, the hotel charges for the single Arpeggio and Ristretto capsules.  If you are staying a couple of days, I recommend going to the nearby Arenas de Barcelona shopping center, which used to be a former bullring, which has a Nespresso store and purchase a sleeve or more of your choice.

As for the WiFi, I had no problems, but others in my party thought it was spotty.  It seemed slow due to the number of guest staying up to New Year’s Day.  The day after, connection speeds improved as people started leaving.

One of the downfalls of this location is its access to public transportation.  I am not much of a taxi person, but they did have plenty of taxis waiting to take people wherever they needed to go.  While it was nice to walk around the Plaça Espanya, the closest station to the hotel, reaching the station was a bit of a walk, especially with luggage.  I also find it odd that for such a busy and popular station, as Plaça Espanya, that it did not have any elevators to access the station from any of the many entrances, which might make it hard to go to and from airport.  

As mentioned, we stayed during New Year’s Day celebration.  It was nice they offered complimentary sparkling wine or water during the happy hour times.  It was nice to enjoy a couple glasses of the bubbly.  While that was free, it was ridiculous they charged €7 for a small glass of Heineken.

Would I stay at this hotel again?  If I was not paying for it, I would.  While it met our needs and was a comfortable hotel, I feel there are better hotels are cheaper price points and in livelier neighborhoods.",4,2017,01,27

12,Excellent Hotel Well Placed Near Montjuic,"We stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate New Year 2017. We were in a Club Suite (302) so checked in at the Club Lounge. check in was smooth and we were provided with a local map and recommendations of where to go and where to eat, which was much appreciated.

The Club Suite was small (for a suite) and, quite frankly, dull and uninspiring decor wise. The outdoor balcony has a table and chairs but little in the way of a view.

We've used Club Lounges in quite a few hotels around the world - the lounge in this hotel is one of the very best. There is a separate room for breakfast which had a good variety of food from fresh fruit to cooked options. In the lounge itself snacks are served at lunch and dinner times and very nice they were too. Drinks are available all day and are complimentary and include tea and coffee, soft drinks, wines (including Champagne), beers and spirits. Lounge use is complimentary with a Club room but anyone can use it for a fee. If anyone wants to pay it's worth joining the IHG loyalty programmes as this reduces the daily fee from 50 Euros to 20.

Service from the staff there is excellent, especially helpful were Danxia and Ana.

The location of the hotel is excellent for the Montjuic area where the Arenas shopping centre is and, of course, the fountains, where the New Year celebrations and fireworks were held. It's also easy to access all of Barcelona from here, there are 2 Metro stations within 5-6 minutes walk - a lot cheaper than using taxis - if you're here for a few days, the most cost effective ticket is a T10 which gives 10 journeys fro 9.95 Euros (tickets can be bought from a machine using cash or plastic).

If you want a genuine, non-touristy tapas experience head for Blai (5 minutes walk) where there are many tapas bars - we ate at Blai 12 where we ate our fill of tapas and Pintxos, had a glass of wine - excellent fare and cost 14 Euros for 2!

In the opposite direction is the Arenas shopping centre with a wide variety of restaurants, some of which are on the roof where you can go and walk 360 degrees for a view of the city. We ate there once - the food was poor and well overpriced and looking at the menus of the others, prices are well over the odds.

We've been to Barcelona before and know it's the pick-pocketing capital of Europe and take precautions accordingly, even though, while in the Arenas I was caught out. If someone stops you and points out something has been spilled on the back of your jacket and offers to help clean it up - refuse - he's a thief - his help cost me the cash contents of my wallet.

As well as the most popular attractions of Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell our favourite things to see in the city are Palace de la Musica and L'hospital de Sant Pau Recinte Modernista - book both in advance. Outside the city, if time allows Montserrat is a must see.

All in all (theft aside) a great stay. On our next trip to Barcelona we will stay here in a heartbeat.",5,2017,01,07
12,Nice hotel,"The crowne plaza hotel is a business hotel with a good value for money. The rooms are ok, meeting rooms very large -can accommodate big groups.

12,Fab Crowne Plaza,"This was a great stay, as spire elite members we had a suite with access to the club lounge.

Not sure I would pay extra for a suite as it was quite old fashioned although large and comfortable.  I think a club room would be fine.

It's nice on arrival to be whisked away from the main reception up to the club lounge to be checked in and to be offered refreshments whilst doing so.

The club lounge is the best we have ever seen!  Moët and Chandon champagne available all day, along with top brand spirits, wine and soft drinks, extensive breakfast buffet included in the morning (which was kind of average to be honest), nibbles at lunchtime and in the evening, along with cakes and biscuits throughout.

Friendly and efficient service throughout too.  Decent free wifi, and a taxi rank right outside the hotel.

Ok the hotel isn't on top of the tourist area, but to be honest we didn't care about that as were there to pick up a cruise and had visited the city before.  Didn't get to visit the Magic Fountain which was five mins walk away as it was raining in the evening.

There is a small convenience store opposite the hotel for any nibbles etc you may want for your room too.

Give the club room experience a try here, if you want to feel special and looked after.  we stay in many Crowne Plazas that could learn from this one in Barcelona.  Top class service!  We will return!",4,2017,01,03

Reception 5
Club lounge 4
Spa 1
Restaurant 3
Location 4 

Hotel was smart and clean but lacked atmosphere. Some of the staff were excellent and some very poor. 
Upon arrival we did not receive the welcome drinks. We were taken upstairs to the club lounge and told to help ourselves to food but were not told the plates were hidden inside on of the tables so we had to wait for about 15 mins while the single receptionist attended to someone's tourist plans. 
The room wasn't ready so we went to the spa which came at an extra charge (not included in the rates paid for the hotel even though we had a club suite) the reception added the charge to our room. We went down to the spa where they said we needed change for the lockers and they couldn't give us any so after going back to reception for change they then told us there were no lockers! And no treatments available all day. They then handed over a towel and a swimming cap stating they were compulsory. They didn't show us round. We made our own way into the spa where we were then chased down by the pool in front of everyone stating we had not paid to be there. We gave them the room number like we were told to and they said reception didn't know anything about it and we must pay in cash. So we did and told reception afterwards who said they shouldn't have done that and eventually credited the duplicated charge from our account. 
That evening we tried the restaurant which had very little choice and no atmosphere. No music playing. It felt like a canteen. Other than that the food was pleasant along with the waiter staff. 
The club lounge was great because you could sit in there quietly and help yourself to any drink you like including the Moët and there was a computer to help you find what you needed before you went out but only the one so not good if one person sits there hogging it to use Facebook all evening. 
The suite room was kept very clean and was comfortable. 
The reception staff were great on my birthday. They arranged a cake with a candle in the bar where they sang happy birthday and we had a free drink from the bar. 
The stay didn't get off to a great start but it ended well.  
Generally though if you were not already familiar with their facility and routine, it wasn't explained to you and you were left to figure it out for yourself. 
Location was a pleasant walk to the dock where the shops and sites were to be found. And an easy taxi journey back. 
Overall a nice place to visit. ",3,2017,01,03
12,"Nice hotel, but overall disapointed.","After endless reviews of hotels in Barcelona, it was the Spa that sold the Crowne Plaza to me. As we were staying between xmas and new years eve, the thought of a nice indoor hot spa really appealed to myself and my girlfriend. Unfortunatley, the Spa was probably the one bit that let's this hotel down.

We arrived very early and very tired, to be taken straight to the Club Lounge. Our cases were also taken here but once we arrived, they were just pushed to the side of the club lounge door as we were left standing with no real explanation of what to do next. As we couldn't check in until 3pm, (its now 10am) we decided to hit the Spa. On arriving at the Spa, we were met by two rather sharp reception staff who informed us that we needed 1 euro each for a locker. They wouldn't accept notes, so I had to make my way back up to the main hotel reception in order to get some change. When I returned, the reception staff were then telling my girlfriend that there were now no lockers free. We had to share a locker (one available in the mens changing room only). Eventually after getting into the rather small and busy spa, we were then met with the receptionist demanding that we needed to pay. This infuriated myself and my girlfriend as the club lounge lady had said that the payment for the Spa had been added to our room, something that obviously had not been communicated to the Spa staff. This meant I had to go back into our locker, and pay 30 euros cash. In a bad mood now, which wasn't helped by the crowded and quite cold spa. We left after an hour - something that I hoped would be a major part of our relaxing break.

However, our Suite (Club Suite) was nice enough, not overwhelming - and slightly on the dull side but enough space and nice and clean. Our USB Connectors had no power (apparently your TV has to be on in order for these to work) - Still broken, so maintenance provided us with a free connector socket which was appreciated.

As it was my girlfriends birthday, I had contacted the hotel to ask for the birthday cake and cava but it seemed to go unnoticed until I asked the staff at reception. They then gave us two drinks vouchers, and provided us with a slice of cake. Very nice of them, and it did feel like a nice personal touch.

We dined at the hotel restaurant one night, but it felt more like a canteen than a restaurant. The menu was a little basic, there was no music - we just dined to the sound of clunking cutlery. An average size steak with a side dish of onions and croquet potatoes set us back around 18 euros each. We opted to leave and went back to the club lounge for a drink.

The hotel itself is clean, but not massively alive. It may have been the time of year, but its felt like it was almost closed... and just open for a few locals.

I can't really fault the hotel staff, and the rooms were ""big enough"" - Maybe a tad expensive for what you actually get. Not a massive wow factor anywhere in the hotel.

I'd recommend, but not go back. To me its just a ""clean"",  ""business"" hotel. Without club lounge access, I don't think I'd have been happy. Especially not for a romantic break.

Thank you Crowne Plaza staff, can't fault you... just let down by the Spa and Spa staff. A little bit of lack of preparation / communication and a quiet atmosphere. Other than that. A nice Hotel.",3,2017,01,03

12,Amazing Hotel!! A Must-Stay!!,"I have stayed in around 50 different hotels all around the world and have to say, Crowne Plaza Barcelona is the best I have ever stayed at! I literally don't have a bad or even indifferent word to say about it.

I came with my dad who was celebrating his 60th birthday and it could not have been a more perfect place to stay. We only mentioned once at check-in that it was his birthday, but on that afternoon we came back to the room to find a cake with a message wishing him a happy birthday - a very personal touch!

As we had booked a Club Room (which wasn't that much more expensive), when we went to the main reception to check in, they immediately escorted us up to the Club Lounge where we were checked in and offered drinks/refreshments; it really felt like top class service from the outset. The Lounge itself was an amazing place to relax with a drink and snacks - and not just any drinks, but single malt whiskies and champagne, so they really didn't skimp on the quality. Most of the time we were alone in there, but on odd occasions in the evening we would be joined by 5-6 others

The room was immaculate, with all the amenities you'd expect and need (including a 60 inch TV). Even the shower gels, creams etc. smelled fantastic! (I'm a lover of small, insignificant things :) )

Perfect Hotel!

12,Great Hotel!,"Stayed here for three nights as part of a sponsored trip for winning a contest to watch Justin Bieber at the nearby Palau Sant Jordi. 

When we first stepped into the hotel, the exterior was just like a normal dull hotel and lobby looked rather dated though it was still well maintained and clean. Receptionist were most welcoming and polite and we had a pleasant check in experience. Being a Spire Elite member, even though the hotel booking wasn't done directly with IHG, they gave me access to the lounge which was a very nice gesture. 

When we went up to the room, we were really impressed by the modern look and feel of the room compared to the lobby. The room was really big with a big tub and a nice sofa area with a big king sized bed. 

We enjoyed the breakfast at the cafe and there was even some attempts at pleasing the other Chinese tourists with some oriental noodles and porridge though of course it wasn't authentic but at least they made an effort to please their guests. 

Hotel is a good ten mins plus walk to the metro station and five mins to the museum area. We walked about twenty minutes to the Palau Sant Jordi and it wasn't that difficult. You just have to cut through the museum and there's escalators and paths up the hill leading directly to the Olympic Stadium and Palau Sant Jordi.

12,A wonderful hotel in Barcelona!,"Barcelona, a lovely city that we visited twice before, was our jumping off point this last late October (2016) for a cruise. Thus, we only had two nights in this city, and at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona--Fira Center. 

This hotel was simply the nicest of the three hotels in Barcelona we have now tried.  When (not if) we return to this most interesting city, we will definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza. Why? For these reasons: 

1) Room size and comfort: many hotels in Europe have small rooms, beds with extra firm mattresses (think sleeping on rocks like the Flintstones, for those who recall that 1960's era cartoon series), and minimalist bathrooms. The Crowne Plaza is very much an exception to all that, at least in their Club floor rooms. 

We had a very spacious king bedroom, which included a small sofa and chair at the end of the room, facing a commodious desk area (great for business travel). The TV was modern and large.  The bathroom was also large, with a closed off toilet area from the tub and shower--and it was a separate tub and shower set up. 

Free Wi-Fi in the room also worked well. 

Now, not all the rooms may be this spacious and gracious, but one can certainly ask to see different room types. I can also state that everything was fresh, new and well maintained and kept clean by the very nice hotel maid staff. 

2) If you can splurge, book the Club Floor. This is one of the best club floors we have had the pleasure to experience. There was evening tapas, with a very decent selection available, along with Moet Champagne, wine, and hard liquor (including premium brands of Scotch, such as Glenrothes) available. The morning buffet was wonderful--with lots of choice of hot and cold dishes, not similar to a north American buffet, because, naturally, one is not in north America! It was delicious and fun to try different foods in the morning and in the evening.

The club room itself is also quite spacious and pleasant, although the a/c could have been on a little stronger.    

3) The staff were also all very accommodating and friendly. From check-in to departure we felt very welcomed.

4) The hotel dining room is very good. The first night, given much jet-lag, we did not want to go traipsing about. We thought we would try the hotel dining room. If not great then we would go elsewhere on our second night. As a frequent business traveler I do not expect much from hotel kitchens.  Well, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. 

The hotel food was very good, the location/décor was fine, and the service was again welcoming and friendly. In fact, it was so pleasant that we returned there on our second night! 

The first night after appetizers we had fish (very nicely done, and quite fresh). The second night, having watched a table get a filet steak for two we also ordered it--beautifully done as ordered, along with lovely side dishes. While the prices are of course in Euros, we felt the cost to dine in the hotel dining room was equivalent to what one would pay for a good upscale dinner out in any large city. The value was clearly present, in our opinion. 

5) There is a cab stand right out front of the hotel. The doorman will help with the luggage and will communicate with the cab driver (alas, I speak no Spanish) for you. Ensure you take a hotel business card when you go out, however, as one cab driver claimed that he did not know where the hotel was--once I gave him the card he was able to figure it out and get us back to the hotel.   

As readers can see, I have many reviews on Trip Advisor. It is fair to conclude from reading my other reviews that I call it as I see it and am a tough, but not unfair, critic. In this case I am pleased to provide kudos to the Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, as the hotel was really great. It is now our go-to place in Barcelona!",5,2016,11,24
12,Traveler's heaven,"Among the top five hotels I have ever stayed in.  

This is based on booking a room with access to the club lounge where the breakfast is sensational, the snacks in the evening are so good you can skip dinner out, and the atmosphere is (almost always) quiet, relaxing, and lovely (p.s., if you drink beer or alcohol, the selection is absolutely wonderful; and if you drink carbonated soda, that's there too!).  Open until 23 hours daily. 

(Only ""but"" is that kiddies are allowed in. Though they are seldom guests, in my experience, Spanish parents don't try to control them.  The place can turn into a kindergarten. This is unusual.  Just a ""heads up"". )  

Wonderful staff, and very accommodating.  You could imagine wanting them all to be your friends outside of work.  Nice bar/lounge abutting the lobby.  Easy walking distance from Plaza Espana, so take the Aerobus if you are flying in (it runs so often the timing is like taking a taxi, and the Aerobus is conveniently found and comfortable).  Save a lot of euro.  That option can't be beat really.

Taxi (always outside the door) fare to the central Plaza Catalunya is only about 6 or 7 euro (or you can walk back to Plaza Espana and take the underground for around 5.90 euro -- easy as pie).  

The superior or extra (can't remember what it is called) room with club access is large and well appointed.  For instance, the bathroom has a soaking tub separate from the shower.  Both have exceptional water temperature and controls.  There is a small fridge fully stocked, but it has space to put something in of your own that you can purchase across the street at a SuperMart.   Also, free bottle of water every day.  And free wifi -- fast too. 

Very comfortable bed and extremely quiet -- almost inaudible -- heating/air-conditioning unit, which can be adjusted and delivers the right temperature you like.  Comes with slippers and bathrobes. 

I'll stop here.  If you can get a ""deal"" at or around 140 euro/night, don't hesitate.",5,2016,11,22

12,Relatively standard,"The Crown Plaza Barcelona - Fira Centre is in a great location for the near by conference centres, but it's a pretty standard hotel. Standard clean room, no real views, and services are ok... note that the pool is out of service at the moment (November 2016), but it doesn't say that anywhere... the gym is a couple of treadmills and some light weights... I did like the bar though. Do try the local cava, as it goes down well. 

I think I just expected more for the price (as it's not cheap), but I think I'll stay somewhere else next time. ",3,2016,11,20
12,"Comfortable,quiet, well located hotel","We stayed 3 nites onthe upper floors of this 4* hotel as partofa pre-trip Provene river cruise.  The included rate coverd th Club Roomsnacksandopen bar.  The snacks were taaps and sufficient to avoid dining out in a nearby restaurant.  For a restaurant that is reasona and 1 block away  try Taps.  
The room was spacious,beds were comfortable, and  had a large modern bathroom. Within 2 blocks is the fascinating MNAC, the Catalunya national art museum, a few blocks further is the Miro museum which we visited on a prior tript, and  also 1 block away  the Espana metro stop which gets you to Sagrada and the Moderniste architecture within 5 stops in 10 minutes-buy a T 10 card which 2 people can share.  For the buildings, buy advance tickets to La Pedrera, Batlo,and Guell park as all are busy sites even in November.",5,2016,11,18
12,Good location,Good location - near to public transportation and tourist site e.g. 5 minutes walking distance from Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and 10 minutes from Plaça d'Espanya. Staff were friendly too. Serves good buffet breakfast,5,2016,11,17
12,Best Crowne Plaza we have visited,"We stayed here on an extension to a cruise, then added an extra day to our stay.  We were on the 4th floor and the room was very nice and comfortable.  Nice to have a real bath after a cruise with only a shower.  The beads were very comfortable.  The staff were outstanding, and able to solve any request we had.  Unfortunately we had to move rooms do to a water leak (not in our room) at 11:30 PM, however the new room was a suite where we stayed for the remaining part of our journey - at no extra charge.  The breakfasts were top notch also, with plenty of choices of breads, eggs, etc.  They even cater to Eastern diets. The Hotel is only a few blocks form the Placa d'Espanya - a main square in Barcelona, and Metro station.  I would highly recommend this Crowne for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,11,15
12,Friendly staff,"Hotel was absolutely lovely.. good location. 5 mins walk from the tram and cafes to have ur breakfast. Really friendly staff, who were really helpful and always had a smile on their face. Would definately come back again",4,2016,11,14
12,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is the best hotel in Barcelona.
Near metro and bus station.I can walk about 5 min. to them. It is very city center
Friendly front staff. 
The room is very new modern and nice. And the room is also clean.

The lobby not look like 4 stars hotel but the room is 5 stars hotel.

12,Weekend in Barcelona ,"Good location in the city. Perfect for runners, and walkers. Very clean and comfortable rooms, huge bathroom.  Friendly great stuff in all areas. Breakfast could be better, but it is all you need. Thanks. ",5,2016,11,12
12,Fantastic,An absolutely fabulous stay!! The staff are so so helpful and just absolutely wonderful. The location isn't right in the hub near sagrada or barceloneta but it's very close to the subway and it's easy to get there. I completely recommend.,5,2016,11,10
12,Fantastic hotel!,"We booked a normal 2 double bed room for 3 nights and on arrival were upgraded to a luxury suite with access to the club lounge! The hotel is one of the best that I have ever stayed at in more than 65 years all over the world! Very modern, well maintained and luxurious.",5,2016,11,05
12,Met expecatation,"This hotel is in fact in an excellent location. Within walking distance to of the fountain and everywhere else. Many shops, restaurants and places to see. The only complaint is a need to simplify the heating and cooling system within the room. Its kind of hard to figure out the thermostat and had to call down for a service tech to help us. Second, no matter how low I set the thermostat, the cool air would not push through as desired. Other then these issues, our stay was remarkable.",3,2016,11,05
12,Lovely hotel. Highly recommend!,"This hotel is in a great location near The Magic Fountain. The hotel itself is spotless with huge rooms. We had a twin for our 3 boys and a superking for ourselves. Very comfy beds, even the kids said so! Tea and coffee, water, chocolates and biscuits in the room ( although you have to pay for nespresso capsules.) Huge t.v, even an aromatherapy spray to help you sleep.  We actually nearly missed breakfast on the first morning , we slept so well.
The only thing I didn't like was the frosted glass in the bathroom around the toilet and shower. 
The staff were all great too  and added to the whole experience. Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2016,11,03
12,Half term getaway ,"Arrived here Sunday 30-10, stayed until Wednesday 02-11 (3 nights). Hotel ideally placed as a base to explore the city; hotel staff are a credit, rooms well appointed & suitably sized. Special mentions to the evening bar staff in Scruples lobby bar, as well as the lady managing the breakfast service. Thoroughly enjoyed the Nou camp, aquarium, open top Turistic bus tours and wonderful eateries, shopping & bars.
",5,2016,11,02
12,Fabulous stay!!,"We spent three nights here on our way to Marseilles for a 10 day cruise.  It was a 'fabulous' experience.  We had lovely included breakfasts, and were allowed access to the concierge room, snacks and drinks, including alcoholic beverages, available all day.
The rooms were spacious, very clean and comfortable.  The hotel is in a great location, not too far from the subway and with some very nice attractions close by.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  If we were to return to Barcelona, we would definitely stay  here again.",5,2016,11,02
12,"what an amazing beautiful hotel, so clean and modern and BIG, the staff were wonderful","this was the best Hotel I've ever stayed in, I've been in a lot.. beautiful hotel, so clean and modern and BIG, the staff were wonderful it was in a perfect location for site seeing. i wish i was there longer, the buffet was the best.",5,2016,11,01
12,Excellent,"Business & pleasure 
Excellent hotel staff very friendly professional  position is good for the metro  very clean
All facilities you would expect form a hotel of this stature 
One minor comment you have to pay to use the spa which as a guest I think this should be  included 
Will defiantly return  ",5,2016,10,31
12,"Great hotel, good rooms, modern","I was very positive surprised by the hotel. The rooms - even the standard rooms - are hugh, modern and clean. Bathroom is very modern. Overall service offered is good. Good place to stay. Breakfast is ok.",4,2016,10,26
12,Great surprise!,"This property exceeded my expectations! Stayed her during New Years and it was at ground zero. The fire works, the crowds and we were never far from our place. Get the club as an add on. You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,10,25
12,Great Staff who really care !,"My first visit had a few problems. I told the Manager on duty what had happened to upset me and from that point on, she absolutely went out of her way to make it up to me. My internet was fast, the room temperature was perfect, I enjoyed my visit to the spa. So Maria and Begona, with their professional attitude and sincere customer service, totally made me into a fan of the Crowne Plaza Barcelona. Thank you ladies, I'll see you soon.",5,2016,10,24
12,Beautiful Barcelona,"We stayed here for 3 nights and we thought the hotel was excellent. We stayed in a superior room which had a large bathroom (walk-in double shower, bath, bidet and toilet....the shower was excellent). The room itself had a humungous bed, huge flat screen and some lounge chairs. It was really comfortable and clean. I didn't realise that we'd also booked the club lounge access which was great......free Moet, single malt and all the other drinks you could think of. We had a separate check in and private breakfast although the breakfast downstairs was hotter. The hotel is located right next to the Montjuic park and Font Magica. It's a 20 minute stroll to La Ramblas. Would defo stay again. Tips....We had an AMAZING meal at the Agust restaurant, would definitely recommend a visit. Another tip is to book the Sagrada Familia tickets before you go. The blue bus tour was cosmic. We had an evening meal at the food market which was epic, can't remember the name though. Tonnes of seafood, snails and sangria.....delish!!!  ",4,2016,10,22
12,"top hotel, perfect for business stay in Barcelona","So one thing - not a critique - but for the traveler it is good to know. the taxis in Barcelona are problem. they might take you on a ride. the Crown Plaza used to be called Fira Center, so make sure you polish your spanish and mention near the Plaza d Espagna to make it clear where you are going.

I got there and was escorted to the exec lounge, the hotel offered an upgrade to an executive suite. the room has a separate bed room with ensuite bathroom and a living room that gives access to both bathroom and bed room. 

the bathroom was magnificent. one room with a beautiful walk-in shower and then a separate room with bidée, toilet and bath tub. 

the living room feature a huge Philips LED TV and wall connectors to hook up your laptop. there is a bar with Nespresso machine and fridge. a door leads to the nice balcony with a bar table and two seats.

overall really luxurious and spacy.

the bedroom had a king size comfy bed, enough lights and an area to lay down your luggage next to the bed, which is very handy. there is a window leading to the balcony. double window so you are not disturbed by the street traffic.

the room was clean and room service showed up once a day to leave a bottle of water and nice sweets. there is also discounted access to SPA but I could not make. will def. try next time.

the exec lounge where I did the checkin procedure was spacey and full of comfy lounge chairs. it servers breakfast, small lunch and evening food including drinks. the lady at the reception was very helpful and did call me up after I got to the room to check everything was ok.

Perfect! that's customer service. that how you do it. in case you are a hotel owner, come and learn here. Thanks Renaissance.",5,2016,10,18
12,Nice place,We stayed here the day before our cruise. It's a very nice hotel my only real complaint would be that the restaurants close pretty early and the food from room service isn't that good. We loved that it was pretty close to the cruise port and we were able to check in at 9 am instead of 3. I would definitely stay again.,5,2016,10,16
12,Lovely hotel,"Nice hotel 2 minute walk from the Magic Fountains and Placa Espanya. Room nicely appointed, great shower, comfy beds. Hotel looks recently refurbished. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Was upgraded as a  IHG Spire Elite member and had access to the Lounge. Nice breakfast in the lounge and snacks of evening. Pool / sauna has €15 Euro access charge.",5,2016,10,16
12,Pre Cruise Stay,"Chose hotel due to location and facilities. Great size room with gigantic TV and bed. Bathroom bright and spacious. Only problem was A/C a hot day and there was no power on any setting, little air coming through which did not cool the room.  Room adjoined by apartment block thus had to keep curtain closed.",5,2016,10,13
12,Short City Break,"Before arrival the staff at this hotel always answered my emails promptly and gave me lots of advice and tips. Even though I had not booked a twin room, the front desk staff were kind enough to allocate a twin room for my friend and I for the duration of our stay.

On arrival we were greeted warmly by a young female receptionist who gave us lots of local information which we put to good use.

The rooms really are first class and very comfortable. You can tell they have spent a lot of time and money into modernising the hotel. 

It's not far at all from the bustling areas of the city and in most cases we walked everywhere! 

Highly recommend. ",5,2016,10,12
12,Convenient ,We stayed at the Crowne Plaza before a cruise. It was very conveniently located for the metro and hop on hop off bus. The hotel was very clean and situated in a quiet area. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again. ,5,2016,10,08
12,Business trip in Barcelona ,"Nice hotel with good attention. 
Rooms are super big and very comfortable. Breakfast was good and so was food in general. Located very near Montjuic. 
I definitely will repeat. Wifi worked perfectly for our business meeting and logistics were very well organized. 
Good experience ",4,2016,10,04
12,good location good for business,"no pool in this hotel The room are big and renovated. However from a close up you can see that the hotel is quite old. 
The restaurant is ok and fair price. The breakfast is also within the standard. 
for the club member be advise that platinum member will be charged, but the staff are not advise that a charge will be applied.",4,2016,10,01
12,"Sleeping Rooms to accommodate women travelers, excellent conference staff","The Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center is a gem.  The catering and conference services staff were excellent.  The hotel rooms are large, the beds incredibly comfortable, the water pressure excellent, and most importantly, for me, they recognize the importance of catering to the female traveler with a powerful hair dryer and a lighted make up mirror (10X).  The location is terrific - 2 blocks from the Catalyun National Museum (a must see), and also convenient to the Subway.  The hotel is 20 minutes from the airport, and I liked being about 15 minutes from the crowded las Rambla area.  The front desk staff are knowledgeable and accommodating.  My meeting went off without any problems, and my attendees were very happy with the food as well as the sleeping rooms.",4,2016,09,30
12,Great hotel with helpful team!,"We've been staying at the hotel from 3 till 5th of september. Hotel has convinient location. It is close to the metro, very near by Art Museum with beautiful fountain show during the weekend, walking distance to Montjuic park and the most important is the staf - very helpful with positive energy. Nuria gave us a great recommendations what to visit and where to have small bites and delicious dinner. It was our anniversary and when we get back to the room there was a small surprise for us which touched our hearts. Thank you Nuria again!!! For sure great hotel to stay!",5,2016,09,29
12,Fantastic stay!,"We stayed here as a family of three for four nights.  The room was very large, very clean and staff were helpful. 

It was quiet, close to the fountains (5 mins stroll) and a shopping complex (10 mins stroll) with restaurants and a supermarket. 

We felt it was a safe area to walk around in day and night, something important to us with a young child. 

You can hop on/off the tourist bus nearby too.  There are quite a few restaurants within walking distance.  We had breakfast in the hotel (usual buffet style, nothing special but it was fine) and dinner one night in the hotel (would recommend going elsewhere, we dined at the hotel as we were tired.)

It's not near the hustle and bustle of Barcelona so I would not recommend for couples or groups looking to party.  But for young families this was ideal for us.  We had plenty of space in our room yet we still found it very accessible to to key sites. ",5,2016,09,28
12,Excellent hotel,"We just stayed over at the Crown Plaza Fira for a long weekend. It is located just a few streets away from the Plaza de Espana, which is itself just 20 minutes away from the airport with the Aerobus. It took us just 35 min from the hotel to the airport. 

The most touristic places like the Gothic quarter and Barcelonetta are a short 5-10 minutes bus away.

The hotel itself is on a fairly quiet street. The lobby, rooms and lounge area are all very modern. The staff is very nice from the front desk to the cleaning team. We got lucky enough to be upgraded and really enjoyed our stay there !

There is free wifi, a spa and the breakfast is very diverse.

We'll go again !",5,2016,09,28
12,Very nice hotel. Stayed one night prior to a cruise.,"Great hotel. Can't usually go wrong with an IHG hotel. It was in a quieter area, just down the street from the magic fountains. The hotel staff were great. The room was clean and overlooked the street. No complaints.",4,2016,09,26
12,"Nice, quiet location, close to Metro and more.","I picked the Crowne Plaza because of their IHG affiliation and good reviews and a fair price.  The location turned out to be great for us.  A short walk to so many things including the Plaza de Espanya Metro stop, the Hop On Hop Off bus stops, the art museums and the magic fountains and their light show.  The staff was great in helping us with information, the room was large, especially by European standards and everything was clean and comfy.  We could have stayed in the more touristy areas around Las Ramblas or Barri Gothic but we were very happy with the quieter local. There was  number of good restaurants close by too.",5,2016,09,25
12,Excellent Hotel (but very expensive for what you get),"We stayed in what they called a deluxe room (which overlooked a wall and a roof, i.e. no view) and cost on average €220 per night, however we have stayed in far better standard rooms in other Crowne Plaza Hotels.  On the first night we were there, we had face cloths in the bathroom, we had tea and coffee sachets and we had a free bottle of water, these all disappeared the next morning and did not reappear for the rest of our stay.  One evening we decided to have a snack in the bar and were charged €32 for two teas, a club sandwich and a roasted vegetable wrap, these would have cost us no more than €8 in the local deli and would have been at least double the size.

However, the hotel room was clean and the beds were comfortable.  Most of the staff were friendly and helpful, but some of them were surly and almost acted as if they did not want you there.",3,2016,09,22
12,Outstanding Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here with friends this week for four days. From the moment we checked in to the point that we left we enjoyed world class service of a type rarely received. The room was very comfortable ( the bed even more so), the staff were incredibly helpful, (even in the club lounge where we got good advice as to where to eat) and the facilities were fantastic. 
Talking about the club lounge, the food on offer was better than most others in the chain. 
We were treated to two Spanish soccer teams staying at the hotel whilst there. Despite obvious security issues this did not impinge on our stay at all but simply added to our experience! 
A brief conversation with the hotel manager left us in no doubt how much he loves his hotel and cares about his guests. 
Make no mistake, we would gladly return here. ",5,2016,09,22
12,Excellent stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in a club room. Check in was very efficient and informative at the dedicated club lounge. As we had arrived in the evening our room was ready. We had booked a king room, which was located on the 6th floor giving a city/mountain view. It was exceptionally clean and vary spacious. We also had access to the club lounge throughout the day and evening, which included a buffet breakfast and selections of canape's. There are both soft and alcoholic drinks available as well which included premium brands, which are self service. I cannot compliment both the club staff and lounge facilities enough, both being excellent. The hotel is approx an easy 10 min walk to the Metro station, which takes you past the magic fountain at Montjuic. We did have a dinner in the hotel restaurant and both had the salted beef tender loin, which was superb. We used a taxi for the airport transfers which took about 20 mins. This may take longer during rush hour. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and we do intend to return.",5,2016,09,19
12,Excellent hotel,"I had a great stay at this hotel attending a conference which was held at the hotel. This is a large modern hotel and my stay was faultless. Everything worked very well indeed.
My room was huge and it was very quiet.
The location near the Olympic Park is good but is obviously not in the city centre. It is 100 metres from the airport bus stop and 200 metres from the Metro (3 stops to the centre). If you turn left as you exit the hotel and walk 200 metres you reach the magic fountain which starting at 9:30pm each evening there is the most amazing free music and  water show.
The only negative comment I have is to do with the WIFI access in the conference rooms. Hotel guests get free WIFI anywhere in the hotel except the conference rooms which is odd. OK you can charge people not staying in the hotel when using the conference room WIFI but why charge hotel guests twice?",5,2016,09,18
12,Wonderful ,Great location and wondeful staff who are happy to go 'above and beyond' to assist their patrons. We had a great stay here. Its just a few minutes walk from the 'Magic Fountain' and a Tourist Bus stop. The room was superb. ,5,2016,09,17
12,Modern Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  The hotel is situated very near to the Magic Fountain in Montjuic (2 minutes walk).  The staff were very helpful.  The room was modern, clean and very large with 2 large comfortable beds (we were 3 persons in all). The a/c works quietly you won't even hear it.  The only negative point is that it is situated around 30 minutes far from La Rambla.  However there are 2 metro stops near the hotel. The area is quiet all through the day.",5,2016,09,15
12,Barcelona weekend,"Excellent hotel close to the Metro, lots of places to eat within walking distance.
Tour bus is always worth taking, tickets can be bought from the hotel at a small discount. There is a stop near to Hotel, a short walk away.
Barcelona is a great city with lovely friendly people, one word of caution there are thieves about- as in most cities- so take the usual precautions, especially with your mobile phone.",4,2016,09,13
12,City Tour Barcelona,"Stayed one night in Crowne Plaza Fila Center and let me say it was a very pleasant experience. Hotel was very good and so was the room...... While it was small but was very neat and clean...

Service was excellent. On knowing I was a manner of IHG the offered welcome drink or to accumulate additional points in exchange for the drink.... Staff was very sweet and courteous.

Very good place to stay and am sure to go back soon
",4,2016,09,11
12,Barcelona Vacation,"Located near where the 92 summer Olympics was held provides a nice setting in an area full of outdoor restaurants and short walk to the underground subway.  The Hotel is just as advertised.  Clean, well appointed with a well trained staff to help.  Rooms were above average in my opinion with fridges which was great because our kids like their milk cold.  Bedding, hard surfaces and floors are cleaned daily.  The food offered at breakfast was abundant, and varied which was great for the kids.

The only downsides are the pool is off limits to kids under 16 and getting a taxi ",4,2016,09,07
12,well sitautaed hotel,"stayed with the family for 5 days, the hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful, the hotel is close to the city centre and all the hop on hop off tourist buses.
The restaurants were limited but there are many nearby at walking distance from the hotel.

Although primarily a business hotel it was suitable for families",4,2016,09,06
12,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for a week our 3rd Visit and glad that we took the decision to go back. Yet again staff really helpful hotel clean. Club lounge for breakfast was nice and quiet , room clean and spacious. Ideally located by the magic fountains, and only 3 stops on the L1 metro into the center of Barcelona. Will be going back on the next visit.",5,2016,09,04
12,Amazing Experience ,"We stayed in Crowne plaza for three days. It was a totally amazing experience. Friendly staff, excellent breakfast and very convenient location. The room service was good and rooms were very clean and hygienic. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will recommend this family friendly hotel. ",5,2016,09,03
12,"Breakfast disappointing, otherwise average","Breakfast: The breakfast room feels overcrowded during the busy time. The chairs and tables are close together, you need to carefully maneuver between other guests when walking around, and you will sit very close to other guests in the morning. I found this unpleasant. Especially because the breakfast room is the place I spend most time apart from the room.

In the breakfast room, they have one Nespresso machine to provide coffee and tea to customers. Just one for such a big hotel. Occasionally they also someone go around with coffee in a jug. It would be nice if there would be a good self-service coffee/tea facility for a hotel this size and ranking. This really surprised me.

Also, the Nespresso machine (they have them in each room as well) is difficult for people who drink tea (water comes out slowly). Also, unlike many top hotels, they have few tea choices and you often need to ask to get the tea you want (because they have fewer than 10 bags laying at the self-service nespresso machine).

Boiled eggs are cold, though! They seem to cook them a day before. If you do not eat meat, there is a little to eat, very few cheese options.

Generally, the breakfast feels poor compared to similar hotels and would be the main reason for me not to come back.

Also notice that there is no chef cooking on side where you can ask for a special omelet or so!

They have baby chairs, but they don't seem to be bothered that they are not cleaned. We had to do that ourselves.

Some breakfast staff are great, but generally, the team makes a stressed impression (maybe too busy, not enough staff). For example, the front manager often runs around to help out with stuff and many guests walk in just to find a table themselves.

Rooms: Our room looked on the back of the hotel, overlooking a hotel roof and not very nice at all! The windows are relatively small and room felt dark. Otherwise, our room was good. The beds are very good. There were few hangers in the closet. Our door did not close well, you had to pull it well in order to get it closed.

Reception: The reception people are very good and attentive and helpful.

Restaurant: The El Mall restaurant is very expensive and serves relatively small portions.

Gym: They gym is very nice, with modern machines in a nice room.

Location: Although other peopl complain about this, the metro is only 10 minutes walking, and with the metro you can get pretty much everywhere. That said, for some people this might location might feel somewhat away from where everything is happening, and there are few restaurants in very nearby. Also, the taxi stand is right at the hotel, which is convenient if you need to get back to airport, etc.",3,2016,09,02
12,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed at crown plaza for 4 nights,room was absolutely  spacious,bed was very comfortable.there was everything you needed in the room,actually i'v never seen such a wonderful hotel like this before.Breakfast was also great ,I love the fresh juice & delicious cakes.Further more the omelet was tasty.Also the hotel located in a very good place,it's very convenient.",5,2016,09,02
12,Checked all the boxes,"We stayed here the night before our cruise. It's in a nice area and has free wi-fi, good air conditioning, non-smoking rooms and outstanding breakfast buffet. Only wished we had stayed a second night!",5,2016,09,01
12,"Lovely clean, updated hotel in the Fira area, very near the Museum of Catalonia and the old Plaza del Toros","The hotel was lovely, the room very large and quite comfortable. Nice firm mattress, puffy (poly fill) pillows, although a bit too puffy for me as I prefer down. But we both slept well.
The room was very clean, and the hotel staff I interacted with were very responsive, warm and friendly. 
This is quite a large modern hotel, and it's situated in a more residential area, so it's fairly quiet outside even though the street gets a lot of traffic. There may be parking somewhere, but we were on a package tour and didn't see any place to park except a spot for buses to drop passengers and spots for perhaps 3 taxis waiting for fares. 
We stayed there the first 3 days of August and the temperature in Barcelona was very, very hot. The ac in the room worked well, keeping the room nice and cool, a welcome relief after walking around downtown. The public areas of the hotel were also well air conditioned, but the corridors and elevators were less so - they were noticeably warmer. 
The bathroom was large and very modern with a large glass enclosed shower, separate enclosed toilet and bidet, good hot water and plenty of counter space around the sink. Bathrobes and slippers were provided, as were basic toiletry items such as soap and shampoo. There were nice fluffy towels, but if we took a shower in the afternoon to cool off after returning from touring, the towels were not replaced before the next morning. So if you needed a second shower later that night, and there were two people staying in the room, you had to reuse your towel, still wet from your earlier shower, as they provided only two bath towels. Note for American travelers - this hotel, like many (if not most) in Europe does not provide washcloths! Plan ahead and bring your own. 
Our room had a small refrigerator and coffee/tea making supplies, and a large closet as well as a good sized desk. Nightly turndown service was sort of spotty. The first night we were there someone did come in and turn the bed down and leave us each a chocolate. That didn't happen again, so either we weren't supposed to receive it and the first night was a mistake, or we were supposed to receive it and the second and third nights were somehow missed.
The hotel offered a wonderful breakfast buffet, with literally anything anyone might want, from typical American breakfast foods, (scrambled eggs, soft boiled eggs, eggs over easy, hard boiled eggs, ham, bacon, sausage) to all sorts of sliced meats, sausage and cheeses, many sorts of breads and rolls, pastries and even cake. The breakfast buffet also offered a large assortment of fresh juices and many sorts of sliced fresh fruit. They even had an area of oriental food, including rice and several other offerings in that area, some with fish, and miso soup.They had an expresso machine which also made cafe au lait (cappichino). You could get hot water for tea, with a selection of teas available. Interesting to me as Spain I thought was known for it's hot chocolate, when I asked if I could get a hot chocolate the first morning (I don't drink coffee), the smiling waitress said yes and then brought me a cup of hot water and a packet of Nestles Quick! 
I don't know the price of this breakfast as our room came with the breakfast included, but I'd certainly have been willing to pay for it. Everything was hot and fresh and very good. And the Nestle's Quick made me smile.
Another very nice part of our stay was the Concierge Level. I don't remember now what the area was called, but it had a nice lounge area with a large screen TV, and tables and chairs, plus a large table with computer and printers. The room was staffed with friendly, smiling young women. The best part of having access to this room was every evening about 7PM they set out a good selection of I guess tapas, some salads and even desserts. Different nights they had different hot foods, empanadas, various sorts of small fried croquettes, pizza, an egg dish and other things. They had a large refrigerator filled with many types of water, beer and soft drinks, and they had both red and white wine, as well as chilled sparkling wine (?Cava), and an assortment of liquors and aperitifs. It was all self service, you mixed your own drinks, or poured your own wine, and served yourself. A waiter would appear periodically to remove soiled dishes and replenish the foods (which were delicious). There was no charge for any of this. 
Other than at breakfast we never ate in the hotel restaurant, but the late afternoon when we first arrived we did order sandwiches and drinks in the bar. The sandwiches were generous in size and very good.
There weren't many places to eat or shop in the immediate neighborhood, although many places did have their shutters down since it was August and the holiday time. So perhaps there's more in the immediate area then we saw. This hotel is not in a tourist area, although the old Plaza del Toros is about 6 blocks away. To my surprise bull fighting is now illegal in Catalonia, and so the old bull ring is now filled with shops and restaurants! Public transportation is also about a 6-8 block walk away, but we did take a cab home from the Los Ramblas area one day, and the fare was only about 25 Euros. 
I'd happily stay here again, but it's probably not a great location if you want a lot of shopping or a good choice of restaurants very near by. And getting on the Internet is not easy, and it was very slow.",4,2016,08,29
12,Great breakfast choices,"We stayed here for eight days in March.  It was easy to get to the hotel from the airport – the airport bus stops on the main plaza, and the hotel is a short (5-10 minute) walk away.  Access to the metro system is located on the same plaza, so it’s convenient for getting around the city.  

We particularly enjoyed the range of breakfast items, which set us up for the day.  As well as the standard hot-and-cold breakfast choices, oriental food was also sometimes on offer, presumably to cater for the Japanese and/or Chinese visitors.  Once or twice, there were even a couple of bottles of breakfast champagne tucked away at the far end of the buffet area – keep your eye out for these!

While we were there, the hotel was the official host for runners in the Barcelona Marathon.  What was especially noteworthy was the appearance at breakfast of some runners on the morning AFTER the marathon.  Several of them shuffled in as if they were hospital patients in recovery from major surgery, barely able to lift one foot in front of another.  If I were ever to think about running in a marathon, the memory of such post-event trauma would – I hope – deter me!

We’d be happy to stay in the hotel again.",4,2016,08,29
12,I stay in ihg hotels 100 times a year and this was the best.,"Pay for a club room or if more than €30 more than standard pay for club room access. It's worth it. Free champagne, free breakfast, free alcohol, free tapa at lunch and evening time. Free soft drinks also. Great service. Join the ihg club if you have not as this will earn you points to get free upgrades and night stays. Also search accelerate programme. ",5,2016,08,29
12,Summer City Break,"Great hotel , great location , professional friendly staff , very clean , great breakfast , we stayed in the middle of August and the hotels air conditioning  was very welcoming at the end of a busy day ,we found it very easy to navigate around Barcelona from here and there are plenty of restaurants and even a supermarket ( in the arena ) should you need one , our only complaint was that we had to leave , 5 days  flew by ",5,2016,08,28
12,Three days in Barcelona,Very nice retardant near one of the beautiful museums in Barcelona. Staff was terrific. Rooms were very nice and large. Food was great. Not situated close to the city center BUT the taxis are inexpensive,5,2016,08,25
12,Perfect & Relaxing Stay,"Me and my friend stayed in this very modern hotel.
Personally, location wise is good. Next to a metro station, Plaza de Espanya and its easy to find the hotel. 
The room is very clean and spacious. The bed is firm and have a long comfy pillows. The toilet is huge with separate toilet, shower room and bathtub. And seriously,there is huge TV  in the bed room. We were chocked to have that huge TV. We did not though use the TV that much as we were out most of the time but i think it is worth to mention.
The staff are very welcoming and helpful. 
We tried the spa and had an hour massage.Relaxing ambiance but the massage was not satisfactory. Before we booked the massage we ask which one of the package that has a hard  massage. But unfortunately it was not at all hard massage. It was almost like they tickle our body.  Hahahha though we still enjoyed it. Well, we are kinda oblige to coz of the price we paid.
Over all, I recommend this hotel. I love it.",5,2016,08,25
12,Excellent Hotel,"Crowne Plaza Barcelona is really an excellent hotel, rooms are extremely spacious, toilets are modern and new, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Location of hotel is excellent with many attraction in walking distance. Highly recommended. My only point, is that swimming pool and the sauna club should be available for free for hotel guests.",4,2016,08,23
12,Nice stay,"I had a really nice time at this hotel, the hotel is really clean, has an amazing smell in the reception and common areas. I used the gym, the equipments are really new, well main tended.
The breakfast is good with a lot of options but for fresh fruits I didn't like too much, I believe they can improve the fresh fruit options. But in the rest everything was really good in our stay. 
My father was on birthday during our stay and they left a bottle of champagne and macaroons in the room what we really appreciate this.",5,2016,08,22
12,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is a few minutes walk to the magic fountain and a 10 minute walk to Espanya Metro station and the Arena shopping mall.

The size of the room was good and the bathroom was large, with a separate shower and full size bathtub.

Only negative was that we called for clean towels on 2 separate occasions and both times it took over an hour to receive them. I was told they only have 1 person from housekeeping working at night.

Would recommend to others.",4,2016,08,19
12,Outstanding hotel with excellent service ,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel. It is located in a great Neighborhood. The staff was welcoming and professional; the lobby was nice with multiple, comfortable seating areas; the rooms were spacious, with comfy beds and really nice bathrooms.
The breakfast buffet was excellent. 
I loved Barcelona and this hotel! Most definitely recommend it!",5,2016,08,18
12,Excellent as usual!,"Third visit here and the hotel and staff never fail to impress. 

Friendly efficient and helpful staff really make the place extra special. 

The club lounge is the best I've ever seen. I'd like to know if there's another as good anywhere to try that,as I don't think there can be!

Location is fabulous with a short walk (3 minutes) to the Magic Fountain and its surrounding delights. 

A corporate hotel with a personal level of service. Just wonderful. 
",5,2016,08,16
12,"Very Nice, super service, nice rooms with plenty of space.","We stayed for 5 days and the hotel is located near the subway to get easy transportation, and near the tour lines.  Our room had a king with a sliding door and a fold out in the living room. The bathrooms are nice, but there is clear glass in the shower through to the bathroom area.  There is a small fridge but eh best part for us was as a group we paid for access to the concierge suite which had drinks and snacks all through the day.   Nice if you are running and can't make it out for a meal at the right time.  The breakfast are very nice if you pay for that options, lots of things to choose from.   Overall a very nice and comfortable stay.",5,2016,08,14
12,"Very good hotel, in a very good neigborhood","We stay there during 3 nights, the hotel was clean, quiet, room are large, bathroom also, near the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, but taxis are very good to take you every where not expensive, very good buffet breakfast and snacs from 10 am to 10 pm in the launch, I recomend this hotel, free wifi",5,2016,08,13
12,"A feeling of ""Could do better""","Mixed feeling about the hotel so I will try to be as objective as possible:
The Good: Location is great, staff are helpful, convenience stores right across the street, condition of the hotel is good (in some parts)
The Bad: The internet connection is really a joke there, don't rely on it. Some front desk people try to play it smart and drive you to extra expenses however, raise the issue and you will be satisfied, management is quite efficient.
The Ugly: I feel bad about it as I only experienced it the last day, but it was a revelation. While we didn't suffer at all from noise from outside the hotel, the isolation of the noise inside corridors is really bad. We could hear conversations coming from the hall way and worse, house keeping ladies having their morning chat while cleaning the adjacent room while we had a do not disturb sign at the door :)

A real effort needs to be done and with some fine tuning, that could become a really great spot. To me it lacks this special thing yet. A bit more variety for breakfast could be useful too!",4,2016,08,13
12,One of the best of Barcelona,"We stayed two times in this hotel, we use to book ICH group Hotels because I'm member. This is one of the best Crown Plaza that I stay, the rooms are news and very big with an extra large bed. All in the room is superb. The situation is excellent, close to the airport, close of the old city center, next to the fair, etc.
For me is the best choice for visit Barcelona",5,2016,08,11
12,Couldn't be better,"Excellent staff on desk at check in and during our 5 night stay providing travel information and tips.
Gave me the room i booked and on the floor i requested
Breakfast was more than adequate, staff at breakfast were attentive but not in your face
Gym had modern equipment with water and towels for the user
Whole place was spotlessly clean.
Location near buses, metro and attractions",5,2016,08,11
12,Excellent facilities and service,"Great location, well connected to the transport link with both Metro and bus service and a great hospitality service of the staff, Well done to the team. The Breakfast spread is amazing and well run served with passion.",5,2016,08,09
12,Great city location and service,"We stayed here for a week in a suite. The suite was superb, great space, quiet and brilliant to relax and quiet!
Club lounge and staff were great, very friendly and accommodating in helping. Location is 5 mins from metro with buses within 3 mins walk to all main areas, plus it's within 3 mins walk of Fountains!!
If you want somewhere with luxury and good service, here's your place in Barcelona!! ",4,2016,08,08
12,The best in Barcelona ,"I am a spire elite member,  I book 4 room after a 8 days cruse with my family and friends.  They upgrade one room to suite and the other to club room .  The hotel is very quite and clean the room is very big and nice , the location is very near to metro station and shopping center and a lot of restaurant.  The staff of the club lounge ( Ana& ....) was very helpful. also the club lounge manger which I did not meet was very kind .  If you book a room you must book room access to club lounge so you can have breakfast,  afternoon snakes and dinner also all drinks is free.  The bill boy kamel and Dived if very helpful.  I advise any one go for holiday or business to stay at this nice hotel.  If you want to go any where by metro or taxi it's cheap and near .  La Rambla hotels is noisy but Crowne plaza is very near and quit and the price is good.

I would like to thank all the staff of Crowne plaza Barcelona for there help and for the nice days I stay there especially the club lounge staff and manager, kamel and David.",5,2016,08,05
12,majestic on montjuic,"it's just the best hotel i've ever been to) and the best location in barcelona, just on the slope of montjuic mountain, few steps from placa espagna. the huge cozy room with very smart lighting, comfy bed and chairs, tasty coffee, even the sofa in the hall is just unbelievable comfortable soft) the place to really indulge yourself.",5,2016,08,04
12,"Amazingly friendly staff, comfortable beds. Brilliant stay","Booked this hotel last minute when I read that our booked hotel was under renovation and the beds were a health hazard. So glad we moved to The Crowne Plaza hotel. The reception staff on check in we're all most welcoming and exceptionally helpful. I had written an email to inform the hotel of my wife's birthday and soon after going to the room the hotel sent a bottle of sparkly to the room. Amazing. Thank you. The room is great. The pillows are a bit strange: one one pillow the width of the bed, but the staff immediately solved this by sending individual pillows. The bed is fantastically comfortable. The room is fresh and well appointed, the bathroom bright with a great shower. The breakfast offers a wide choice so it should cater to all. The restaurant staff are polite and very efficient. The hotel is located in a good area with plenty of shops and restaurants. I highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2016,08,04
12,Fine hotel; perhaps a tad corporate for a family stay,"We picked this hotel because we like the brand. We'd previously stayed at Crown Plaza's that were family friendly but this property had a corporate feel. Unsurprising given the proximity to the Fira District. 
That being said, it's a very modern & comfortable hotel with rooms much larger than average in Barcelona.
The bedding and furnishings are of the expected standard.
I thought the public areas, particularly the lobby were a little dark. Not my preferred decor.
Breakfast was substantial and the quality was high.
The hotel is close to the Placa Espagna. Worth a vist particulary at night.
Other areas of the city were walkable if you've no objection to a longish stroll. Barca is a lovely city to explore on foot.
We only frequented the bar once. It was not family friendly in its layout but the server was efficient",4,2016,08,03
12,Worth every penny!,"Our stay at Crowne Plaza, Barcelona has been absolutely amazing!! 

All the staff are very friendly and very accommodating. 
Room was just perfect & spotless on arrival and every day after cleaning. 
Breakfast was lovely and the spa was amazing!! Would 100% recommend.
The hotel had a very calm and relaxing mood which was just what was needed for our break. 
The hotel itself wasn't too far from anywhere in a taxi, 20 minutes at the most and the fares were no more that 20€ to any sightseeing you may want to go to, which is fantastic as the hotel has a taxi rank right outside - never a long wait for a taxi. 

We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we visit Barcelona. Worth every penny. ",5,2016,08,02
12,Great End to a fantastic Holiday..,"I have previously stayed at this hotel with work and have reviewed it before, but always promised to come back with my wife, as the hotel is situated in a great location to some of the fantastic sights that Barcelona has to offer.

The hotel is 500 meters from a Metro station and you can be in the Rambles in 7 minutes or on the beach in 13 minutes, or just jump in a taxi that will be outside and you can be anywhere in a short space of time.

The Hotel is away from the real hustle of the city but close to many great places to see, and being here this time as a tourist it didn't disappoint us.

The Hotel is spotless, the rooms are fresh and modern and the staff cannot do enough for you, It is equipped with a well equipped with a Gym, but sadly no pool yet! But I would imagine it must be on the wish list, it would be perfect with a rooftop pool.

The breakfast was great with a wide selection of fresh produce and attentive staff, what more can you ask for?

This is now the 5th time I have stayed at this hotel ,and as always the staff are always there to assist you with any questions that you may have, they are very knowledgeable and are keen to help you. 

This was the last destination to our special anniversary holiday and the hotel and staff made it a memorable stay in one of our favourite cities, thank you.",5,2016,08,01
12,"Smart and comfortable hotel, helpful staff everything you need.","We arrived at the hotel after midnight, after our flight was delayed and then we had got lost in Barcelona ( not hard to do)  the hotel was an oasis of calm and the staff welcoming and helpful, and spoke excellent English. We collapsed into a very comfortable bed and slept like babies, hotel was very quiet even in the centre of this huge city. We enjoyed a lovely late breakfast, and really felt like the holiday has begun.  There is great underground parking at this hotel from which you can access the rooms directly by elevator. They do charge Euro 18 per day for this, but if you have a car with you its very convenient, and secure.",5,2016,07,31
12,Work & Play,"I've stayed at the hotel twice in the space of one month; once for work and once for leisure. The fact the receptionist who checked me in the first time around recognised me the second time around was the first big thumbs up from me! Super friendly staff and great faculties, from the gym to the bedrooms and the breakfast to the dinner. The rooms are spacious and modern, the conference facilities are adaptable, modern and user friendly and the open areas are welcoming and comfortable. The breakfast is substantial and high quality, and the dinner also surprised my partner and I - authentic and tasty! My only critique would be that the dinner menu wasn't overly extensive - it would be nice to see some additional seafood options on the starter list such as oysters or calamari, especially with Barcelona being a seaside destination. Don't let the location put you off either - it's in a good part of town near the national art gallery which is one of the most stunning settings in Spain, and close to the shops and a metro link to the beach. ",5,2016,07,30
12,A modern and nice hotel,"We spent 3 days at this hotel, during our first time trip to Barcelona. Location is quite nice, near Plaza d'Espana, a beautiful square, opposite to Palau Nacional, a majestic architectural building originally built for 1929 International Exposition, and close also to Poble Espanol- a village/cultural museum. 
We enjoyed the hotel and the room was really nice and big.
I would go back anytime.",4,2016,07,30
12,"Wonderful Hotel, Staff and Amenities","Stayed here for three nights with friends and children -- Staff was amazing, helpful and tolerant of rowdy little boys! Excellent rooms, beds and toiletries. Small touches such as cookies at bed turn down were appreciated. We added breakfast to our rooms and the buffet breakfast was superb -- omlelette station, dozens or freshly baked breads and pastries, fruit, cheeses, cereals and juices -- set you up for a good days. Close to metro stop that can take you to all the sites. Only dissappointment was no pool or access to hotub.",4,2016,07,29
12,"Best hotel, there's no place like home.. Except this one","The service and accommodations were excellent. Coming from the US, there was one thing I forgot and that was an adapter for my American appliances (flat iron, curling iron). My room was equipped with a smart TV, usb and European plugs. The hotel had plenty adapters unlike the H10 hotels I stayed in previously. The restaurant El Mall in the hotel had excellent food with reasonable prices. Only a short walk from the famous fountain show. My vacation started when I checked into this hotel even though I was at the end of my vacation.",5,2016,07,27
12,Excellent customer service👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,"Beatriz Nunez should get a promotion and a raise!! Excellent customer service by a great front desk clerk!  We checked in with another family for a summer vacation at the crowne plaza fira centre and Beatriz helped us with the process. She was quick friendly and very helpful with everything and made all of us feel very comfortable. Superb and spacious rooms, huge shower stalls and modern look. Loved it all! 7 stars from me!",5,2016,07,26
12,"Serene, Safe and Centrally Located","Zen-like room with great view, just a block away from Font Majica which the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas were modeled after. Room had comfy bed, large shower with rain head and handheld options, separate large tub, bidet, thirsty cotton towels, robes and slippers. Even lavender to put on your pillows. Near Plaza Espanya (5 min walk) where you can catch Metro or buses to virtually everywhere. Market is steps out the door if you want to purchase your own snacks, although the room has a snack bar and mini fridge, and Nespresso for coffee! There is also a safe for valuables. A great little restaurant called Casa Tapes is right down the street and we would highly recommend it. We ate all over the city but the best meal was right near our door. Buffet at hotel is expansive but pricey at $15 euros each. Was pleasantly surprised when we arrived and after a week are still delighted with hotel.",5,2016,07,26
12,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful people!","Congratulations to a wonderful team that offered only smiles and a wonderful attitude during my stay in the hotel! I haven't seen so many young people with a professional and positive attitude in a very long time. Also, I really enjoyed the breakfast - delicious and diverse, and the Business Center -  great facilities and Internet connection. I hope to come back one day to your wonderful hotel.",5,2016,07,26
12,Incredible stay ,"We stayed for 5 days in your lovely hotel , it was very enjoyable and relaxing stay. Your team at the front desk were very helpful, especially Sabrina who guided us to all great restaurant in town. We will definitely come back really soon. Just one advice to expand further the gym equipment. Also thank you to F&B team during breakfast and bartender is amazing guy full of knowledge. Cheers ",5,2016,07,24
12,Great location!,"Great hotel! The people at the front desk were very helpful and the concierge was great. Although not in the city centre it was easy walking distance to the metro station and was quite for sleeping. Great breakfast with lots of variety, large rooms with comfortable beds and great water pressure in the shower. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,07,23
12,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is in the perfect location close to a lot of restaurants stores and sites we really enjoyed our stay very clean comfortable accommodations , we would definitely return to this hotel , the staff is very professional and friendly. This hotel is located right below the 1992 Olympic stadiums. They are still in very good condition and being utilized. Close to the train also. ",5,2016,07,23
12,Very Nice Hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel at the beginning of July with my wife & 12 year old daughter.  

I have booked an executive room hoping that, because of my Spire Elite membership, I would be upgraded to a Suite, however I wasn’t, they upgraded me to a Club level, which gave me access to the Club Lounge.  I have to stay that the room was in fact extremely large which lead me not to ask for a Suite 

The staff were very helpful, especially the lady at breakfast in the Club Lounge, talking of which, the lounge was very nicely appointed & had a fair selection of drinks & snacks throughout the day

The only slightly negative point of the hotel, although it’s not that negative, is the location which is a bit far from the center",4,2016,07,23
12,WONDERFUL CITY BREAK,"The hotel is perfectly situated for easy walking distance to las ramblas and most areas. We upgraded to get access to the lounge which enables you all day and evening access to nibbles, all alchoholic beverages including champagne and soft drinks. A light lunch and evening tapas are also included in the upgrade, it was well worth the extra. We had two interconnecting large family rooms which were fantastic, exceptionally clean and serviced to a very high standard. One could not fault the hotel.",5,2016,07,21
12,excellent,"This hotel is one of the best service providing hotel in Crowne Plaza brand. I stayed 3 nights for business meetings and I really enjoyed to stay there. Rooms were very clean, brerakfast was quite good. staff were very helpfull and I liked to have espresso at the breakfast.",5,2016,07,21
12,"Excellent all round service, spacious room and a wonderful club lounge","My wife and I stayed here from Fri 15 Jul 2016 to Tue 19 Jul 2016. It was our anniversary and her birthday so I wanted something special. The rooms were very spacious with a lovely huge TV that was easy to connect to my media players eg an Amazon firestick, Chromecast etc.

The staff at this hotel are fabulous (and as this was a special occasion) I paid for access to the club lounge. This is a must as the concierge service in the club lounge could not have picked better restaurants and daytime activities. The choice of top brand named alcohols (inc moet and chandon) and soft drinks were also great! We ate all breakfasts in the club lounge and also some lunches and evening meals there to. All food in the club lounge was always hot, re-stocked and very edible.

I thoroughly recommend this place and hope you opt for access to the club lounge!",5,2016,07,20
12,Amazing IHG group hotel at a great location,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 days in one of their club rooms with access to the club room. The room was very comfortable and modern and the club room was very convenient for breakfast and also snacks when we came back to the hotel at night. The quality of food and drinks at the club room was on par with a first class lounge. 

In terms of location, the hotel is ~10 mins away from the metro station and it is very close to Montjüic Park. The neighborhood seems fine as well. 

Definitely recommended and we'll definitely stay here when we come back to Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,20
12,Pool access,Great place and very modern however the advertised pool on the booking site they call a spa and asked for 15 euros to use it per person. Unusual for a hotel and would have looked elsewhere if we knew before. If your not keen on a swim the hotel is great,3,2016,07,19
12,"Modern, very comfortable hotel","This hotel is very modern and comfortable, with pleasant, helpful staff. Our king sized bed was very comfortable, the a/c was cool and quiet, and the room was large, with plenty of electric outlets. The bathroom was large and luxurious, with separate shower and soaking tub. The toilet and bidet were separated from the rest of the bathroom by a frosted glass door. Also, the hotel provides bathrobes and slippers for its guests. We had a little trouble with the wifi, and the man at the front desk came right up to our room to help resolve it. My husband and I only stayed for 2 nights, and did not eat at the restaurant, although it looked nice. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,07,17
12,Lovely stay,"When I arrived, the front desk person brought me to the club lounge to check in.  The concierge was friendly and professional. 

The room I got was clean, modern and quite large.  I booked the room with club access.  The breakfast in the club lounge was really good.  It was probably the best breakfast I had in any hotel club lounge I stayed before.   It was also convenient to have drinks all day long in the lounge after coming back from sightseeing.  

The hotel location is in a quit neighborhood.  To go to the city center area, you do have to take metro or taxi. It is about 2 blocks from the metro station.  It is also not far from a hop on hop off bus stop.  Overall I like this hotel and definitely will stay here again.",5,2016,07,16
12,A comfortable and modern hotel,"It is extremely comfortable, modern, and accommodating during a stay in Barcelona. Albeit a little pricey, comfy rooms, a nice pool-spa area (you need to pay to enter, though), and an absolutely delicious breakfast (a little expensive but worth it) spread make for a pleasant hotel.",5,2016,07,13
12,Excellent option for business,"Nice modern hotel close to Pl Espanya and the Fira Center (as the name suggests). I was checked in at the Club Lounge and given a room with a great view on the 6th floor.

The room was a nice size and it was great to see an iron and board waiting for me in the cupboard. You've be amazed how many hotels in Spain do not have these as standard.

The only downside of my stay was the quality of the free tapas in the Club Lounge, but the wine compensated for that.",4,2016,07,13
12,Great hotel,"I really like the hotel location. You can get the aerobus, the metro and the magic fountain is really close by. The receptionist upgraded our room since it was our anniversary and was very very kind. The rooms are clean and spacious. We moved to hotel apolo thinking the area may be closer to other sites but we wished we had not. ",5,2016,07,12
12,Definitely worth it,"You might think the area is a little bit far from all the sites, but it's perfect.
The rooms are very good size.  The beds a very very comfortable.  The bathroom spotless and huge.  
Perfect AC, great large new TV.
Front desk very friendly and professional.
The front staff offer complimentary food and drinks when I told them my wallet was pickpocketed.
As good as any Four Seasons without the attitude.",5,2016,07,11
12,One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in,"For the second year running we decided to stay at the Crown Plaza after such a wonderful experience last May. Our Room was a standard double but was more like a superior suite with a massive separate bathroom with large shower and bath. The king size bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in and combined with a wonderful lazy boy chair, giant TV, separate lounger chair and work desk and chair. Add to this a well stocked mini bar, excellent coffee and tea making facilities and it was like home from home, little extras including luxury bathroom robes, slippers and sleep pack were the icing on the cake....rooms were really quiet and well insulated in the main. checking in and out was seamless and the front desk staff were always very helpful and willing. Just a wonderful experience all round.",5,2016,07,11
12,Excellent for business or leisure ,"I was really impressed by this hotel. It's more like 5 star than 4 star. Location is good, near Plaza Espana and a safe distance from the Ramblas.
Rooms are large, comfortable and modern. 
Club Lounge is not crowded and feels really upmarket.
Excellent treatment of IHG elite members.
I'm planning to stay there again.",5,2016,07,10
12,Nice but at that price you would expect so,"We stayed in a club room. Nice big room, but also at a high price. Its ok to pay if the service and facilities match. But we didn't quit think it did.
Firstly, check in is on the A level, if you check in at a club room. The reception guides you to leave a and the club lounge...this took som time, an for what? Why isn't this just done at the check in reception on the ground floor? Seems a bit odd.
The club lounge was nice, all you can drink, champagne, soda, water, coffee and small snacks, tapas. But you had to guess what they were serving? Why nok put small signs to tell whats on the plate? Also, at random, when entering (with your room keycard) you were asked what room number you were in? Why, to get in you had to use the keycard for your room, and you couldn't get ind without a club room key card? And not everyone was asked this?
The room was very big and nice, channel selection wasn't that great (again compared with the price you pay) and one window didn't shut close. Also you could hear the road, not very much, but the mentioned (on the webpage) that they have soundproofed windows. I begg to differ. It didn't spoil our sleep. Large nice bed, pillow to high. aircon very quiet and bathroom also very nice. Both bathtub and shower.
Location is good, you have to wake a bit to the nearest tube, but not much.
So all in all, we did like the hotel, but also found that if you pay that amount of money, the service and quality didn't altogether match.",3,2016,07,10
12,Excellent Hotel,Had a 3 night stay with the wife and some friends.  Hotel / Staff / Service / Rooms and Food all excellent.  Am an IHG member so do get free room upgrade and that was done with no hassle upon arrival.  Not the most central location if you want to be down the beach every day as that is a 30 - 40min walk (€4 in Taxi).  We however visited for the sights and had no trouble taking brisk walks from hotel to visit places such as The Sagrada Familiar (Think spelt right!!).  Would highly recommend as happily say on of the best Crowne Plaza's have used around Europe,5,2016,07,09
12,Wonderfull Hotel,"Fantastic 4* star Hotel in the centre of Barcelona. Excellent modern rooms, great food and very friendly stuff. The best 4* hotel I've been too. Leaving with a smile on my face. Recommend it very much.",5,2016,07,09
12,Excellent Hotel,"Modern hotel with friendly helpful staff, good wifi, rooms are equipped with smart tvs, the best club lounge I've used at any Crowne Plaza, top quality air-con in the room, cab rank outside the front door, good local restaurants all in walking distance, this hotel certainly ticked all the boxes for me!",5,2016,07,03
12,See Barcelona before a cruise,"Booked the Crowne Plaza as a convenient and central location to see the city before taking a cruise. It is a difficult walk from the Aerobus drop off at the Plaça España but is quite stunning with the National Art Museum atop Montujic. Hotel is modern and well appointed, early check-in was accomplished without a hitch. Taxi service out front and the desk was helpful in getting a family of 5 with luggage an appropriate sized taxi for the ride to the port. ",4,2016,07,03
12,5 Star Hotel,This hotel reveived our large group with ease. We got in around 10am just coming off of a 10 day cruise. Our bags were kept secure in a meeting room (too many to hold in their normal holding space) until we got back to check in. Its 2 blocks from The Arenas which has everything you need  food shopping etc. Also its about one and half blocks from the Magic Fountain.,5,2016,07,02
12,Fantastic Hotel - Best IHG hotel I visited ,"I am a frequent traveller and stay at many hotels and can truly say this is one of the best I have ever visited . Certainly for me the best IHG hotel ! I have an IHG spire card and at check in was immediately upgraded to a premium room and given access throughout my stay to the club lounge .

Food in the club lounge was of high quality at both breakfast & dinner with good range of snacks & drinks throughout the day .

The hotel is relatively new so the rooms and all the public areas are fresh and impeccably clean . Nice spa & small gym also.

Location is 10 mins walk from the metro or just 20 minutes walk  from the harbour so suitably convenient . 

I would highly recommend this hotel and certainly on my next visit to Barcelona will be checking in to Crowne Plaza .

",5,2016,07,02
12,Great Barcelona Vacation,"The service at the reception desk by Sandra was the best I've seen in a long time. She helped us check in, upgrade, join IHG and provide information on where to go visit. Sandra represents what customer service is all about, she went beyond what was expected. 

The club lounge is a worthwhile expense and Ana was wonderful in providing information, service and just laughs with us while we enjoyed the Euro 2016 playoffs. 

The rooms at this hotel are spacious and clean, with a large flat screen TV, coffee machine, and big bathroom. There is plenty of space for luggage for those awaiting  their adventure cruise. 

We will definitely stay here again once we return to Barcelona. This hotel is a hidden jewel in the middle of the Parc Montjuic Area, it's safe and convenient. 

Great advantages to staying here are:
- 10 Minute walk to Metro station.
-  Restaurants Bar located in the hotel or nearby. 
-  Many tourist sites within 15 minutes walk. 
-  Wonderful Park for walking or taking pictures.
-  Parc MontJuic around the corner. 
-  Great Gym and Spa.
-  Fantastic Club Lounge.
-  Spacious, modern room.  

Conns:
-  Wifi, extremely difficult to reconnect once the link is broken. 
-  Stained carpets in my room.
-  The revolving door too small to fit with luggage and side door was locked.
-  Valet not visibly available at all when arriving at the hotel, no help with luggage.
-  Not all front desk representatives are as friendly as Sandra.",5,2016,07,02
12,Top class service,Impeccable in service. A hotel so well located and that knows what they are doing. Thank you Ana and Enric for making our day and stay the best it could have been. Love the club lounge. This hotel will be where we will stay any time we are here! Have given a five star rating but could give more. We are here for two nights.,5,2016,07,01
12,"Friendly, helpful staff; amazing facilities; good size rooms and the most amazing spa facilities ever!","I do not often sing praises to hotels, but I feel that this time I have to!  Crown Plaza hotel in Barcelona ticked all the boxes for us, from lovely helpful staff members at the reception to really good spacious room and modern comfortable bathroom, to lovely club facilities and quality food.  There is also an amazing spa with all sorts of saunas and special showers and jets, etc., which you will never want to leave - just make a note that access is not for free (still, do not miss it!).  Crown Plaza in Barcelona is the best ambassadors for the brand I know of, I must say :)",5,2016,07,01
12,Best Crown Plaza been to,"The warmth of the welcome was the start to a great three day sun break to celebrate our 25th anniversary.  I had booked a suite  so we were taken to the lounge to check in and the to our suite. Two rooms longe and bedroom both big and a very well equipped bathroom. Both rooms have a 52"" TV and independent airconditioning. 
The lounge on A floor is accessed via the room key. Free food and drink all day even champagne so paying for the upgrade was almost free.
All in all made our 25th anniversary special.",5,2016,06,30
12,"Hotel itself is fine, but beware: the spa isn't free","The Crowne Plaza hotel's located a 10-minute walk from Espanya Metro station - close to the Magic Fountain, a large art gallery and Barcelona's main exhibition hall.  As it's slightly out of the city centre, it draws a large business crowd - which ends up slightly hindering the overall experience you get when staying there rather than enhancing it.

The facilities themselves are very nice indeed: I overheard people commenting how they loved the large, sweeping, upmarket lobby area, with other communal areas of a similar standard.  Our room was huge, complete with comfortable chairs and a sofa, a huge TV with full range of international channels, and a luxury bathroom complete with separate shower and bath.  You'd have to be extremely picky to find fault with the accommodation at face value.

However we had two gripes: firstly, the website through which we booked our reservation heavily implied the on-site spa (which had a large, beautifully-designed jacuzzi and was one of the primary reasons for us selecting the hotel in the first place) was free to use.  This is in fact not the case - therefore we were surprised when we were each asked for a €15 fee to enter.  We raised this with reception, who agreed - as a gesture of good will - to reduce this to €12, which felt derisory.  We refused to pay, and later took the matter up with management, but felt they were relatively disinterested.  Indeed, all our dealings with reception staff felt very 'business-like' - in that everything felt like a transaction, and we were being processed rather than treated as individual customers.  Service wasn't unfriendly, but it wasn't warm either, and the only emotion I saw from a member of the reception team was when I scored the hotel a '6' on the feedback form I was asked to complete.

Furthermore, things felt a little haphazard: the cleaner, presumably accidentally, threw away our toothpaste, meaning we had nothing to brush our teeth with one night.  The hotel does offer complimentary toiletries, but when we initially asked for some replacement toothpaste, we were told they'd run out.  This isn't the kind of service I'd expect from a chain of this reputation.

While the above doesn't necessarily negate the more broadly positive experience we had at the Crowne Plaza, it does leave ever such a slight sour taste in the mouth - and had we known the spa wasn't free, we'd have probably opted for another hotel with a pool we knew we could use without being charged for it.",3,2016,06,29
12,Exceeded expectations with superb service,What a great hotel. A cut above any other Crowne Plaza I have ever stayed at. Service quite simply excellent. Arrived weary and shown straight up to Club Lounge (worth every penny) for Champagne check in. Cases whisked away. Rooms spotless and well equipped with excellent shower. Suite lovely with lots of room to allow a mixed trip of business and pleasure. Concierge very helpful made our stay a joy. Lovely pool and well equipped gym. One of my favourite Tapas restaurants just down the road. Cant wait to return,5,2016,06,29
12,Really disappointing for my expectations,"The location if you are a tourist is not close to all the happening Barcelona. You can take the metro or a taxi for an average of 6 to 8 Euros one way. The room was very confortable, however we had to ask them to vacuum and clean it well. The hallway was so dirty during the four days stay, no one cleaned it. For some strange reason although i had booked a room with breakfast, the breakfast was in the club lounge on the A floor. There is a Nespresso machine, but we had to ask on daily basis to replenish same... On check in it took us forever to do so, as they have no passport scanner and had to type it manually. I know the Crown Plaza chain of hotels but this one was not great.  The cleaning staff was so loud in the morning... You could hear them from your bedroom",3,2016,06,29
12,Usual Crowne Plaza hotel Standard,"I had a wonderful time at the hotel and staff was really nice and friendly. I had stayed in this hotel for 3 nights (during 2nd week of June 2016) using my IHG Reward points and still manage to be upgraded to a better room. 

Room are big enough and bed was very nice to sleep. Problem with the room was there is a lack of a clock.  I will need to refer to my phone as a clock & alarm clock. But sometime, it's hard to find my phone in middle of night especially when I wake up in middle of night.

As for the location of this hotel, it is not very near to the usual shopping or tourist places. Thus it can be very peaceful at night. On the other hand, I will need to a cab each time I go out.

I highly recommend this great hotel to you all",5,2016,06,20
12,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel is a nice family style hotel. The staff is very friendly, helpful and speak Spanish, Catalin and English. The room we had was a fairly large room with a king size bed and a sleeper sofa. There is a cafe machine and small fridge in the room. The bathroom is large as well with the toilet and stand up shower are sectioned off from the rest of the bathroom with frosted glass walls and doors. There is full size bathtub in the bathroom as well. The breakfast we would have to say is the best breakfast we have been offered staying in a hotel here in Spain. There is a little something for everyone alomg with some of the traditional Spanish breakfast items. The location of the hotel is very nice and there are taxi's parked outside at the front of the hotel. The WiFi in the hotel room was excellent as well with great signal strength and data speeds. Room service was nice as well and the food was good. Overall we would like to stay here again if we come back to Barcelona.",5,2016,06,20
12,Great Stay for entire family,"From the moment you arrive, you feel welcome!  Rooms are large, there is a business center available to print tickets, etc.  Also, available is suite for free drinks (coffee, tea, wine, various liquor,etc.) and snacks.  Continental breakfast is included and staff was pleasant.  The only negative, is the distance from the heart of Barcelona.  Taxi's are waiting just outside the door.",4,2016,06,18
12,Absolutely great stay in Barcelona,"We are on our last day at this hotel after a four night break and one word sums it up : Superb . It is a business orientated hotel obviously and is sited in a business area a short walk from the "" Magical Fountains"" and Montjuic but everything this city has to offer is reachable by taxi / metro or on foot thanks to the wonderfully cheap prices to get around. The hotel is classy, the staff are warm and helpful, we had breakfast one morning and it was excellent with hot or cold options available. All in all we have had a wonderful stay in a superb hotel in a fantastic city. We will be back !!",5,2016,06,17
12,Brilliant on all counts,"This hotel is really a great find, the staff are very very helpful and speak many different tongues, and full of useful knowledge.  The rooms are massive and very well laid out and equipped.  the bed was king size and very comfortable with plenty of spare pillows and blankets.  The tv was bigger than most homes there was also a sofa and 2 chairs (lazy boy that I loved) a nespresso machine fridge and kettle. I cannot rate this hotel enough, it is also Chinese friendly having native speakers and breakfast for them too.

It is centrally located from the fountains and the bull ring and I would recommend using the metro to get to the hotel from the airport as its only 4.50, 10 mins walk from the station, 1 change and very little stairs.  Bare in mind that the normal charge is 25 each way for a taxi this in my opinion makes perfect sense.",5,2016,06,16
12,Excellent,"Room size which is a big issue in Europe, this hotel in Barcelona beats it. Rooms are huge. Neat and very well equipped with the latest amenities. Staff is too friendly. Breakfast display is again 'huge'. It's 300/400 metres from a metro station or 10 mins by cab to the Main Street La Rambla. The property is worth the amount they (hotel) charge.",5,2016,06,15
12,Very comfortable ,"Good location-20 minute walk to La Rambla

Big rooms good facilities and very helpful staff

Good choice for breakfast including meats, cheeses cooked etc with the obligatory freshly squeezed orange juice

We didn't try the spa but our friends did and they recommend it ",4,2016,06,12
12,Home away from home,"The hotel boasts of spacious rooms, a huge smart tv, a comfortable reclining chair and 2 queen size beds. The staff spoke good english and they had a complete set of bath amenities. They also had an ironing board which is great for travellers who always wants their clothes well pressed.
the aircon was not working well though. The room was warm. It was better to open the window so the night air can cool the room. Which was ok except for the noise of the cars outside. Although the noise was tolerable even for a lightsleeper like me.
The carpet in our opinion needed more vacuming or cleaning. It left us with a sorethroat each morning which resolved by the day when we were outdoors. There was also a very faint cigarette smell, not as strong as to trigger an allergy, just a faint one detectable by the very sensitive ones. 
the place is near the magic fountain and about 2km away from rambla.
overall it was ok. We did enjoy our stay...",4,2016,06,09
12,Lovely Hotel In Great Location,"Stayed for a weekend at the Crowne Plaza and loved it. 

Rooms were spacious and exceptionally clean and comfortable. Restaurant for breakfast was great and offered a fantastic choice in the morning. 

Staff were extremely helpful too. 

The only slight negative was the bar food, it was very basic and overpriced. 

Brilliant location for a walk into the port or Olympic Stadium and very handy for the metro. ",5,2016,06,06
12,Can' recommend thishotel,"Too many things weren’t right during our one-night stay to allow me to recommend this hotel. Biggest issue was the no-smoking room we got smelled rather strongly of smoke. When we called the front desk they said the whole hotel was no smoking and apologized but didn’t offer another room or any solution. Since our room had been made up as a triple with an extra bed, I didn’t push it. Although made up as a triple, they only left 2 sets of towels in the bathroom and only one bottle of water. The room had a Nespresso espresso machine but no coffee capsules. I called and asked for extra towels and the capsules and they only brought the towels. The room is somewhat dark and the bathroom is poorly lighted. The separate shower room has no lighting so you shower in the dark. The main tub also is poorly lighted and even though it has a shower head there’s no curtain. The bathroom door opens inward and there’s a door stop sticking out of the floor in the bathroom right in front of the tub. Most aggravating was a motion sensor outside the bathroom so if you get up at night a bright light blasts at you. I couldn’t figure out how to disable it. The cabinet door for the mini-fridge is misaligned so when you open it it drags a drawer underneath open.  When we first got into the elevator to go up to the room the elevator door wouldn’t shut because the “open door” button was stuck. The room was too warm and the thermostat didn't seem to work. I had sent an email in advance asking for early checkin but of course our room wasn’t ready and they said to come back in the afternoon. The hotel décor is a drab grey and somewhat depressing – when you drive up to the entrance it looks rather industrial. The breakfast buffet is quite limited compared to what I’m used to at good hotels in Asia. On the plus side, the staff was friendly, helpful and generally efficient.",2,2016,06,05
12,Perfect Hotel for Barcelona Marathon,"I've been to Barcelona numerous times so the purpose of our most recent trip was purely to run Barcelona marathon, and I chose the Crowne Plaza purely for its location to the race start/finish and it couldn't have been bettered.
  
The airport bus dropped us off 5 minutes walk from the hotel and we were checked in immediately, despite being earlier than the stated check-in time. I'd also messaged the hotel prior to arriving to ask if we could get a late check-out (happy to pay for this) and we offered a complimentary free late check-out the following day after the marathon.

It was 5 minutes walk to the Expo to pick our race numbers up and the whole hotel was geared around the marathon with an evening pasta party and early morning runners breakfast (we didn't have either so can't comment but it was definitely a nice touch). 

On race morning we didn't need to bother with bag drop/cloakroom/toilets as we could literally leave our hotel and had a 2 minute walk to our start pen.

Barcelona marathon was brilliant and the service we received at the Crowne Plaza was the icing on the cake!",5,2016,06,04
12,Great Crown Plaza one of the better ones I have used,"If you are an experienced IHG hotel user then this CP is one of the best I have used.

The hotel is not in the centre and is a good 20 - 30 min walk to La Ramblas, Gothic Quarter, but walking around Barcelona is a pleasure in my view so no great hardship, and where the hotel is situated it is very quiet and ideal for Mt Montjac, Olympic stadium etc.

The hotel has a pleasant bar and communal area and the rooms were large, much bigger than I would usually expect of this brand, no external noise, banging doors etc. 

The Spa was a little bit of a let down as the pool is not really large enough for a swim, it is more like a big whirlpool, which is fine if that's your thing, but we would have preferred to have a decent swim.

At this point I do have to state, in the spirit of fairness, that I am a Spire Elite member of IHG and as such entitled to 'privileges' which in this instance were superb. There is an 'exclusive' club on the floor above reception where they serve breakfast and basically food and drink all day from 7am to 11pm and for us this made a huge difference to our stay and saved us a fair amount of money too! I believe this is available to mere mortals (kidding!!) at around 35 euros per person per night, well worth it in my opinion.

Overall a very pleasant stay and as usual not long enough in Barca!",4,2016,06,01
12,An unexpected pleasure,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, more often I only write terrible reviews. But here they really know how to make you feel like an honoured guest. Many amenities, amazing staff, professional, clean and a great location. Sometimes when I return to the same city I like trying out other hotels. I looking forward to my next stay here.",4,2016,05,28
12,Large Room,"The standard room was a nice large room with a huge bathroom, even by US standards.  There was plenty of closet space.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  Everything was great.  The hotel was a little farther from the main attractions that  we wanted to see but a 25 minute walk on a beautiful day is okay.  This hotel is near the Olympic stadium and National Museum D'Art de Catalunya, a quieter area.",5,2016,05,26
12,Wow....,"Well......

I've stayed in a wide range of global Crowne Plaza hotels and this ranks in the top 3 for sure !!

Location for the concert venue and museums are just perfect.

On arrival we were whisked off to the club lounge where we were checked in by the amazing staff.

We were also upgraded which was a huge bonus.

The rooms are amazing, breakfast with just enough choice.

I could not fault this hotel, only wished we'd stayed longer.

Great work CP Fira Centre !!!!!",5,2016,05,26
12,"Awesome hotel, great location ","Amazing hotel, service was excellent with front desk being extremely helpful and friendly. Location is a big plus being very close to Plaza de España and the metros. It's also in a quiet area so you are able to sleep well.",5,2016,05,26
12,MOST WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY STAY IN BARCELONA,"We stayed here on 20-23 May for 3 wonderful nights celebrating my husbands special birthday. The staff were incredibly welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. We were greated at the desk by a lovely lady who explained all about Barcelona, gave us a map and told us the highlights. Our room was amazing, and we were upgraded to the executive rooms with access to the Club Room. This again just added to our wonderful experience, as gorgeous cakes, canapes and Champagne were availiable until 11pm.Also a very nice bottle of sparkling wine and cake was left in our room.Big thank you to all the wonderful staff who made it such a memorable stay for us, helped us to book our visits, and were always smiling!We hope to come back again to Barcelona and would definately stay here.
Jannette I",5,2016,05,26
12,Amazing Hotel,"Instayed their for 2 nightd on May 3016. It was a great experience, can't wait to travel their soon. 
Many thanks to all the staff of CP Barcelona for their kindness and efficiency. 
The location is perfect, the rooms amazing. 
I deeply recommend this establishment. ",5,2016,05,25
12,Superb location for all amineties,"The room was very clean and even a kettle for us Brits who like our  cuppa. Room was large and spacious, towels where fluffy and changed daily.
We where on the 6th floor at the back which had good views over the city, we chose this location because it was near the Olympic Park and the concert venue Paulo Sant Jorgi. Food in the hotel was good, especially the lamb. 
Another good resturant just round the corner was Il Golfo de Napoli, very pleasant and reasonable with good pasta and pizza's. Lots of other resturants to try next time we go. A short walk to all public transport facities at the Plaza de Espana. 
Good walking shoes recommended, as hilly. Beware when using Auto Bus Touristico, when boarding and leaving during Cruise liner visits gets very busy and difficult, especially around the Sagrada Familia.",4,2016,05,25
12,Luxurious hotel in Barcelona,"I stayed here as part of a large group booking we made for work. The rooms were spectacular, it was like being in a little apartment. The bathroom had a door on the toilet and shower and there was a bath so two of you could get ready at once. The wardrobe was massive, the room had chairs and massive comfortable beds. The WiFi was free and  worked as expected. There was a Nespresso machine in the room but you had to pay for the capsules so that was the only downside. There was instant coffee aswell.

The breakfast was very varied and massive, with a Nespresso machine and prosecco included. The bar was lovely and the wine prices extremely reasonable.

As IHG members we managed to get a late checkout aswell for free so we stayed in the room until we were picked up.

The location is good but to my mind a little far out from the beach and main sites (around 30 minutes walk from La Ramblas). Saying that the walking is lovely and safe to do and the the taxis are extremely cheap. Also if you are planning on using the Hop on Hop Iff buses these stop 5 minutes away from the hotel.",5,2016,05,25
12,Luxurious ,"We booked this hotel through Trip advisor, based on the ratings. The hotel did not disappoint,  except the proximity to the city center. Dailey breakfast buffet, clean, large, comfortable rooms. Close to a favorite restaurant that we found. Taps, we were there every night.",5,2016,05,23
12,Post Cruise Stay,"Spent 3 days in Barcelona following transatlantic cruise. Very satisfied with hotel; however, fire alarm sounded at 3 AM one morning, we evacuated, and the hotel staff had much difficulty finding out where the alarm was activated and silencing the alarm. Fire department did not respond - thought the fire alarms should be hard wired to the fire department. I bet things will change after this incident, and a lobby full of angry and upset guests. Other than that, our stay was very lovely and would stay there again.  ",4,2016,05,22
12,Very comfortable and excellent service,"A five minute walk from Plaça Espanya and therefore very well served by public transport. Very convenient to reach by car (own parking in the same building).
I particularly appreciate the spaciousness of the rooms and exquisite service in general and at The Club in particular.",5,2016,05,22
12,"Great hotel, quiet neighborhood, modern large rooms, nice property","We stayed here for for three nights. Its a very nice modern hotel, large, classy, great decor. The rooms were very nice large with a couple nice chairs, large beds, the bathrooms were very nice, large bright. The staff were helpful and friendly. We had no problem finding places to eat nearby. Its in a quiet neighborhood, we enjoyed our stay here!!",5,2016,05,21
12,"Very Good, really happy!","Really nice hotel, good location easy walk to Plaza Espana and Montjuic fountains. Stayed for 4 nights. Nice smell in foyer. Helpful staff also. Good spa with sauna, steam room, plunge pool and jets. I had a massage also. Small, nice gym.
The room was really good! Two large double beds, interactive t.v, robes and spacious shower and toilet area. Room contained some sleeping scents which I thought was a nice extra. Super happy with my decision to book at the crowns plaza.
Thankyou, oh and breakfast buffet was nice also.",4,2016,05,20
12,Even though we evacuated because of the fire alarm!,"Excellent quiet location!  A very busy city but e everything is accessible. Close to tourist bus stop and metro. Book a club class room and enjoy free drinks, tapas and the buffet breakfast.  Rooms spacious and bathrooms well appointed.  Coffee machine and kettle and plenty of teas, coffees and milks.
Everything very comfortable.",4,2016,05,17
12,Excelent hotel,"Excelent location, clean, modern and big rooms, good restaurant.

12,Great place with great people,"amazing place fantastic rooms and restaurants location simply is the best you dont want to be all the time in La ramblas street very calm and nice location with a walking distance from the fountain of Montjuc castle 

i highly recommend this place for both business and leisure traveler",5,2016,05,10
12,THE PLACE TO STOP IN BARCELONA!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY STAY,"What a FANTASTIC worthwhile stop at this lovely hotel with excellent customer service.
This was our second stop at this hotel whilst travelling to Barcelona and this visit exceeded our last visit! ( the last visit was superb and we were expecting the same and were pleasantly surprised)
A special shout out to maria m and david who both exceeded  in the customer service we received again. IF any hotel chains read these reviews these 2 staff set the benchmark as far as customer service goes!!!
Me and my partner have travelled all over the world and we have to say the CROWN PLAZA FIRA CENTRE is leagues ahead of any hotel we have stopped at both in customer service AND rooms.
For those travellers looking to stop in Barcelona for a friendly, comfortable stay with spacious clean rooms you do not need to look anywhere else!!!!
I urge you to use the CROWN PLAZA!!!
I am not affiliated to the CROWN PLAZA but have left a honest review for a fantastic stay.
We will defiantly stay no other place when travelling to Barcelona in the future",5,2016,05,09
12,Great Experience,"I stayed at this hotel with two purposes: first few days with my wife, and then for business. The location is very convenient. There are subway stations close by. You can walk to Espanya square,  the National Museum of Catalunya, the show by the fonts, the Pueblito Español, and other places. Hotel staff is very friendly, rooms are nice, well furnished and comfortable. Room service is excellent, as well as food. I switched from a regular room which is very nice, to a larger suite type which is also very comfortable. Meeting rooms are good. Gym is small but covers basic needs with modern machines. Overall, very positive experience",5,2016,05,06
12,Top Hotel with hotel activity program,"We did not know about the activity offerings before staying there. Great things would book in advance before the next stay. Great staff, a lot better than the Indigo downtown. Restaurant also quite nice if you don't want to eat outside.",5,2016,05,05
12,Excellent choice,The personnel was very friendly and making all the difference. They have an amazing Club Lounge on the 1st floor with a lot of choices in terms of food and beverage. I would recommend for sure this hotel.,5,2016,05,05
12,Lovely Hotel with Lovely Views,Stayed here with my partner for a weekend break.  The hotel is slightly off the beaten track but the Ramblas etc is easily walkable to (c25 minutes).  A plus point is that the airport bus stops at the Plaza de Espana about 10 minutes walk away.  The hotel is modern and very well run.  There is ample parking near by (we didn't have a car so don't know about prices etc).  It is also near to a street with lots of Spanish bars and restaurants away from the usual tourist areas.  Not cheap but a great place to stay.  All staff were very courteous and hotel was spotless.,5,2016,05,04
12,Very good hotel.,"Good quite location.
Big clean rooms.
Good breakfast, but could be with more variety.
Very efficient check-in and check-out process.
Free wifi.
Bathroom amnesties in room are good and specious, only towels and toilet paper are not up to the standard.",5,2016,05,02
12,Love this Hotel.,"Stayed at the  Crowne Plaza for three nights. Our stay was amazing , the club lounge was exceptional with great tapas also a great selection of drinks including Moët Champagne. Loved the spa so relaxing. Room was lovely with separate sitting room, bed was so comfortable. Staff were excellent.  The only complaint we had was breakfast was cold every morning. We did complain on second day, hoping the next morning it would be hot, unfortunately still cold. Change your hot plates please please before l return. 
",5,2016,05,01
12,Awesome Stay!,Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights and enjoyed it very much. The rooms were spacious. The toilets even had bath tubs. The TV was great except there were very few English language channels. The gym was small but adequate. There was a sauna and nice circuit pool though this was additional for a small fee. The breakfast spread was very ample although the selections did not change much. It was an overall wonderful stay! Would definitely come back and stay here.,4,2016,04,28
12,Fantastic friendly hotel,"My girlfriend & I stayed for three nights over the weekend & from the moment we arrived the staff were very friendly & helpful. El Mall restaurant on site had a nice atmosphere & the prices were very reasonable. The breakfast room was very modern & we had lots to choose from including scrambled and/or fried eggs, bacon, sausages etc as well as pastries & yoghurt. Nespresso Coffee was available at no extra cost which was a nice touch (you can choose your own strength/type of pod). The spa & gym were fantastic too. The room was a nice size with a sofa & large wall mounted tv also. The bathroom was very large with separate shower & bath. The location of the hotel is also excellent with the Plaza De Espania just a five minute walk away. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,26
12,Lovely Hotel,"Just back from a very pleasant stay at this hotel.  Room was very large.  Area lovely and breakfast was wonderful.  If visiting Barcelona again,  will stay at this hotel .  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel",5,2016,04,25
12,Fantastic hotel with great amenities,"What a fantastic experience. We were looked after by Daixya upon check in, in the executive lounge. She spent almost an hour with us telling us where to go, what to do and what to avoid etc. She was so nice.

We got a free room upgrade as part of the perks offered as a spire elite loyalty member, and were treated very well throughout the trip. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,04,25
12,"Just BRILLIANT, this is truly a superb hotel, staffed by a fantastic team!!!","I have been a Platinum/Spire Elite IHG Priority Member for the past fifteen years, during this time my business and pleasure room occupancy totals are well over 700 night stays, from Holiday Inn Express to Intercontinental Hotels, I have used Crowne Plaza´s in London, High Wycombe, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Leeds, and Glasgow in the UK, and also in Amsterdam, Bruge, Paris, Lisbon, New York, LA, Canada, and Dubai. My Wife and me have just spent eight very enjoyable days at this hotel and I have to be totally honest in saying that this Crowne Plaza, is without doubt the BEST overall experience  I have encountered to date!!!  From Mr Enrique Escofet the Managing Director, his number two Begona Campos, Maria Montero front office manager and all of this very professional team (special mention to ""Maria"" in the club lounge who looked after us a breakfast most mornings!) they were all just fantastic. The rooms are spacious, clean and quiet, with mini bar and tea and coffee (expresso machine) and very comfy beds! This hotel is close to the convention (Fira Centre) but also within walking distance of both the Magic Fountain and the very impressive Art´s Museum, and extremely well based to visit all of Barcelona! We used the City Tour bus for two days which I would highly recommend and saw virtually all of the City and Suburbs on these two (green/orange) tour routes, you can board this bus  just by the Magic Fountain 250 metres walk from hotel, both full tours take around two and a half hours each depending on traffic conditions, (39 Euros for a two day pass) The Club Lounge is a ""must"" if you are considering staying here, whilst there is a small daily charge for this facility it is well worth the cost, serving Tapas and drinks from 7.30pm in the evening, but also it is open from 7am through till 11pm, a great place to ""chill"" with a Gin and Tonic after a hard days sightseeing!! Whilst I have scored my overall experience as ""EXCELLENT"" if there was a higher grade I would award this to the hotel, I am not easily impressed and also very hard to please but our overall stay here ticked all of our boxes, and them some!! Thank you to all the team at Crowne Plaza Barcelona, would most definitely recommend and return!! (tomorrow if I could!!)",5,2016,04,21
12,Gracious in every way,"Large rooms, especially for a city.  Well set up for business or pleasure travel.  Note the pool is part of a spa and not for children.  I had club access grabbed breakfast there, and snacks in the afternoon.  Centrally located.",5,2016,04,20
12,Nice IHG Property,"We chose this property due to its proximity to the Placa d'Espanya, the Centre Commercial Arena, and other sites and shopping.  It was a convenient location for walking to nearby sites.  The hotel was clean & comfortable.",4,2016,04,18
12,Fantastic ! ,Stayed here for three nights and can only say I can't wait to go back . We upgraded to club two nights as I had booked reward nights and I would highly recommend this if you are offered at check in . Room was huge and had beautiful views over the city . Staff in all areas were superb especially Danxia in the club lounge . Club lounge is open until 11pm and offers great value for pre and post dinner drinks as these are free !! We used it every night and for some soft drinks and water upon return from sightseeing . Location of hotel is superb and you are a few minutes from montjuic / placa espanya and lots of lovely restaurants. El mall restaurant in hotel is superb and offers great value for money . Would not heditate to stay again and spa was also lovely but avoid at weekend - it's busy !!great gym we used each day was free and spa was 25 euro for two of us . Will most certainly return !!! ,5,2016,04,16
12,Business Lounge saved the day!,"We are IHG Intercontinental members so we found this Hotel as the best option in Barcelona. Location not close to City Centre but close to other nice sightseeing places close by and quite a calm area. Eva in Reservations took good care of us. We found the Hotel clean and modern. The Business Lounge exceptional service by Maria and Giovanna, and we also met Begona who was lovely. Always Moet Champagne and Tappas snacks and good wines and cosy. One word of advice, don't go near the ground floor Reastaurant, apart from the lovely Pianist, food very ordinary and ambiance south of zero. Altogether we ahd a lovely stay. Wifi facilities almost non-existent.",4,2016,04,13
12,Easter mid-week,"Usual superb service from check in to check out. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are only too willing to help and share local advise. Haven't made it to the spa or the restaurant in the evening, although breakfast has plenty of choice for all tastes.  Access to central Barcelona from the metro only 5 mins walk away. Will certainly return. ",4,2016,04,12
12,Long weekend break ,"Really nice hotel in great location , outside busy centre but close enough to walk in or cheap taxi of preferred , location great for montjuic parc and magical fountains which are definitely worth a visit along with the cable car up the mountain behind, cable station about 20 minutes walk , hotel has nice rooms , good views from high floors , nice gym and pool , although you have to pay for pool ? Can't fault  service although we were there on our anniversary which was mentioned in the booking notes and this was not recognised or mentioned at all , on checking in or during stay , which is unusual for 5 star hotel , apart from that enjoyed stay ",4,2016,04,12
12,"On the outskirts, but still convenient","Attended a conference at this hotel which is why I stayed here. Having said it, travelling to the city centre is still convenient as the nearest metro is about 5 minutes walk away. Neighbourhood is also much quieter and very safe.",5,2016,04,10
12,"Great place, perfect for exhibition, a bit remote to feel the downtown atmosphere","This hotel is very comfortable, worth its 4 stars. Large and nice lobby and reception area. Spacious modern rooms, with all amenities you expect. Breakfast is ample, with many choices and plenty of room to sit. No queuing, at least when no major exhibition. I didn't unfortunately have the opportunity to taste the cuisine at diner. Parking is available if you travel by car. Personal was very courteous and helpful. This place is close to the Fira and the Montjuic area, fine if you are there for exhibition. If you are interested by the vibrant port area or by the Rambla for shppoing or night life, you can still walk if you have 30 minutes and goo shoed. Otherwise, a taxi will bring you there for about 8 EUR.",5,2016,04,10
12,Impressive hotel,"First of all the hotel was wonderful, the staff were friendly and helpful thoughout my stay, very quick service even when I wanted something from reception e.g new towel etc. The room was beautiful,spacious and had everything we needed in there, I was very impressed. We was greeted by robes and slippers and complimentary drinks and a few snacks which I was was happy about, I have been to Barcelona before but this has been my best experience so far and I am only here for 3 days. The spa is great has loads of amenities, a warm pool which is a bonus! Breakfast was lovely this morning and I would definitely recommend anyone coming to Barcelona to pick this hotel. In addition this the only downfall is that the area where the hotel is situated, is a bit secluded from the main attractions and the shops and for such a nice hotel you would expect it to be in the centre of Barcelona, also inside out room there was a wardrobe with sliding doors, which stopped working and it got jammed when there was nothing inside of there, this is potentially a hazard especially if kids are in the hotel playing around, it could be dangerous, but on the flip side my overall stay was good and the hotel is still easy to get to, and I would like to thank the hotel for having me, great job guys !",4,2016,04,09
12,Great,"We really loved it! The location was very good wether you want to have a walking tour or a bus tour this is the place to stay. Everything is nearby. The breakfast at the business lounge was amazing. And all of the staff were very kind and helpful. One of us got sick and they really cared and helped a lot.  They called in a doctor, helped us with the pharmacy and kept calling and making sure if everything is good or if we need any kind of help. Definitely recommended!   ",5,2016,04,08
12,"Great, clean and professional hotel","Three day trip to Barcelona, had hotel points to use so booked this Crowne Plaza. It's a good, professionally run hotel. The room is large, clean and has all amenities needed- this was an executive room though, so cannot comment on other types. The club lounge is large, and well stocked...and those who enjoy a beverage or 3 will be pleased alcohol is available all day....! Danxia, the club lounge lady was particularly friendly and helpful, booking restaurants and looking after my wife's food allergies, with specially prepared meals.
Breakfast is typical Crowne Plaza...good choice and quality. Realistically it's too far to walk to the centre (30 mins, main roads) but a cab gets you in in 5/10 mins at a cost if around €7..been here 2 days and can't fault it so far...",5,2016,04,07
12,General Manager,"FO team one of the bets team i saw it in my live , friendly , speed check in
The hotel was very clean with good lobby hotel and i get upgrade to suite, need more attention from bellboy to the guest.

the main restaurant was good service",5,2016,04,04
12,Nice Hotel Good location next to Montjuic,"This is a nice hotel, very clean and good service.  It is very conveniently located one block from Montjuic. It is also close to the convention center and (Fira Barcelona) and a couple of blocks from Plaza de Espana.  The Hotel has a very nice club lounge.",5,2016,04,04
12,Amazing stay for our Anniversary,"Brilliant hotel, great location. The room was amazing, we were given a free upgrade to celebrate our first year of Marriage, thank you very much . The room was luxurious, and spacious could not have been better.
The amenities are first class, we used the SPA for two days and this was an amazing way to unwind after a long day in the center of Barcelona. The gym is fully fitted with modern equipment.
The reception staff where very professional and polite and assisted us with information when needed. We upgraded to the Executive Lounge and the staff there where exceptional. I would definitely advice upgrading to the lounge if you are not in a rush during your trip. the food is delicious and fresh and there is an extensive bar that is free, well included in the upgrade, most certainly a 5 star experience. Me and my wife will definitely be coming back to the Crowne Plaza in the future.
Thank you for making our stay so special. xxxx",5,2016,04,02
12,Nice high end hotel,"We stayed just one night cashing in my friend's IHG anniversary night. Reception was great, the room was pretty big and we both got a super comfortable bed. The location is decent, though a little hard to find (our GPS was off by a couple blocks). The woman at check-in recommended a tapas restaurant a block away (Canote de Tapas) that was awesome. It was a bit of of a hike to a metro station (about 10 minutes), but the neighborhood felt safe and we didn't worry about coming back after dark.",5,2016,04,01
12,Nearly Faultless,"Modern comfortable hotel. Very spacious modern room, very clean and tidy.
Large open lobby, nice bar with live music and good restaurant.
10 Minutes walk from Espanya Metro Station,  100m from Magic Fountain and Ave de Parallel for bars/restaurants plus a number of local bars, taps and local shops within a few minutes walk.
All staff were as friendly and helpful as you would expect from this standard of hotel.
Breakfast is  buffet style with good choice but not brilliant ( has better and worse) but the nearly faultless is due to trying to get tea or coffee is very difficult. The staff appear so busy they very rarely have the time to bring hot drinks to your table. They serve one or two then disappear to do something else, you cant even get your own as their isn't sufficient available, very frustrating particularly when it happens four days in a row.",4,2016,03,30
12,Excellent Hotel and Great Staff,"We have stayed in this hotel for the last four nights and couldn't be any happier. Great customer service from the UK when we called to make some changes to the room. We spoke to a gentleman called Marc who was very helpful. We had the pleasure of also meeting him upon check in, and again his customer service along with Sandra was second to none. They were both so friendly and helpful. They both deserve credit for their excellent customer service. 

The room was itself was also great. We stayed in room 604 on the top floor. It was spacious, clean and two comfy double beds. The location is great for exploring the city. It's less than 10 minutes from Poble Sec metro station on Line 3. You can even Walk to Las Ramblas in around 35 minutes. 

Excellent spread at Breakfast with literally everything you could ask for for. We found the staff to be very helpful in accommodating requests for omelettes etc. 

The concierge were also great, and gave good advice for travelling around the city and helping with our bags and flagging down taxis for us.

I didn't use the spa facilities, but upon having a look, the pool/hot tub did look quite swanky. 

We are quite fussy when it comes to hotels, but the Crowne Plaza superseded all of our expectations.

Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2016,03,28
12,Hotel chain never fails to impress ,"Love this hotel chain and once again was more than happy to stay here in Barcelona. The staff in the hotel are brilliant and it was the perfect place to stay in the city, easy to walk to montjuic and the Olympic park and to be honest we walked almost everywhere in the city. Some great little restaurants near the hotel, cross the road and walk down the street just to the right",5,2016,03,19
12,5 stars,Clean large rooms with cofee tea water and sweets free as welcoming flat tv and air condition young and helpful staff modern but basic firness room and spa good breakfast with fresh produce not alwsys stable wifi connection. Iwould reccomend this hotel ,5,2016,03,18
12,Very Good Stay!,"We spent three nights here in early March and were very satisfied with the service.  They had upgraded our room to a higher floor, which was nice.  Wonderful to have a Nespresso machine in the room and complimentary water.  Breakfast was a little on the expensive side, but fantastic choice (including some asian food).  There are fantastic restaurants within a short walking distance (Taps is excellent and just around the corner!).  About a 7 minute walk to Poble Sec metro station, from which you can reach anywhere in the city in a short space of time (we only used the metro), and the same to Plaza Espana.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4,2016,03,18
12,Director,Good hotel for business. Great rooms and good options for food in meeting rooms. Slighyly off the main roads (quite) still very close to the center. Taxis always available outside. Nothing bad to say about the hotel.,4,2016,03,17
12,Great one night stay,This is a modern hotel obviously designed for the business man. Restaurant. has limited menu...not suitable for kids  Location is OK but a little isolated from the hot spots....about a ten minute walk to Pl. Espana. Ten minute taxi ride to train station,4,2016,03,17
12,Best Hotel Services,"We spent two days in this hotel and the experience has been excellent. a delicious breakfast, attentive reception, a hotel in the perfect set. not hesitate to visit the very complete Spa and definitely enjoyed two massages couple will not forget. definitely an experience to repeat and remember.",5,2016,03,16
12,Very spacious city hotel,"Stayed here on short break to Barcelona at the start of March 2016 with a friend.

Very spacious room with 2 double beds, v. large tv screen and very spacious bathroom with tub and separate shower.

Though this is more of a business hotel located next to the convention centre, we stayed here on a short break. It is well located between the city centre and the airport, both about 15 minutes away. The closest metro station, Espanya is about a 10min walk and the hotel is served by buses.

Near to the Miro Museum and Font Magica. Plenty of good eating options nearby.

Tidy hotel with clean rooms - perfect for a city break",4,2016,03,07
12,Best Conference Hotel Ever,"As a conference presenter and attendee, I enjoyed this hotel on two levels: Travel comfort and support during my presentations.

The rooms are roomy with very comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. The shower was a near-religious experience, which is not always the case when it comes to European hotels. Great water pressure and hot water! Loved, too, that they use free trade shampoo and soap.

This might sound funny, but the hotel smells really good -- there's a spray they use throughout and it's not overbearing, just pleasant. It's available for purchase, and I brought some back home with me. The perfect antidote to adolescent-boy-going-through-puberty smell. #nuffsaid.

Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and helpful. An ongoing joke was that whenever we needed someone during presentations, whether around tech or setup, that we'd call the hotline number and a person would appear almost instantly. For anyone who has attended or organized conferences, you know how invaluable that is! In particular, I'd like to mention the tech/sound people who worked in the main ballroom -- they did such a great job with sound and visuals, and were as nice and helpful as could be.

I only experienced a few meals; their breakfast buffet is, as others have mentioned, really good -- lots of options. I wasn't as wild about the food at lunch, although I don't eat any seafood and therefore much of the food in the region is actually lost on me. 

The location, by the Fira Center, was a great location -- walking distance to some great restaurants and tapas places, and a quick metro ride to shopping areas and attractions. Nice to be a bit away from a really touristy area but still have pretty easy access around the city. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,03,07
12,Birthday trip to Barcelona,"Stayed at Crown Plaza Fira Centre in Barcelona for 5 nights for myself and my partners birthday trip last weekend, had a great time and the hotel and there team were a large part of that. Nuraa from the reception desk in particular was a great help and also noted it was our birthdays, for 2 days running we had a bottle of Cava and some treats left in our room which made the trip extra special. The hotel itself is in a great locaton 10 minutes walk from the metro and just a few minutes away from the Magic Fountain, MNAC museum and the Olympic stadium used in the 1992 games. The room in the hotel was fab with a reclining leather armchair and a 55in tv. Would stay here again if we're ever in Barcelona and would say to anyone thinking of staying here go for it you won't regret it!!

12,Decent loyalty recognition but a royal cluster on NYE!,"My review is a few months late, but I promised myself I'd get around to it due to some crazy stuff that happened (both good and bad, I guess).

I'm Spire Elite with IHG and was very pleased with the upgrade we received from a standard room to a Junior Suite with a nice sized living room, separate bedroom, large bathroom, and balcony. That, plus the overall niceness of the hotel (better than many CPs I've seen around the world), are the basis for receiving the 2nd and 3rd stars.

I'll also give props to the club lounge, which is one of the nicest out there, but is NOT free for elite status members. It's 20 Euro per person for Spire Elite, compared to 25 for general members, so not really fantastic on the recognition there. The breakfast was very nice and the afternoon apps were pretty good, but there was only any signage out once that told us what things were. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, you'll be asking constantly to know what's in things. At least put a sign like, ""contains beef"" or ""contains pork,"" etc., that way people know at a high level what's in it.

The really messed up thing about this stay was New Year's Eve. We simply wanted to eat some food. However, the restaurant apparently is fully booked way in advance, so we could not eat down there. They referred us to the bar. So the bar had some decent looking bar food, but when we tried to order it, they said the bar menu for the night was actually being switched with another menu where everything was 2x expensive (like, $28 US for a hamburger). So they told us we could go back to our rooms and order room service. SURPRISE! The normal room service was not available and they also were on the abbreviated menu.

We went down to speak with the manager and met up with a whole crowd of angry guests who just wanted to eat a simple dinner, but could not do so because 1) nothing around the hotel was open or had space available, and 2) the hotel had more than doubled their food prices. The manager insisted that this was to minimize the number of different things the hotel had to cook since it was such a busy night, but if that were the case then they could have maintained the regular prices. This was just completely absurd.

Ultimately they did agree to honor the regular room service menu for guests who were downstairs complaining, but it was a huge hassle and they acted like they were going out of their way to do us a favor when all we wanted was the regular offerings that we had expected. (It would have been a different story if they'd given us advance notice that standard food options would not be available on NYE; we'd have understood and made other arrangements. But our assumption, and rightfully so, was ""if we don't find dinner somewhere else, we can always just go back to the hotel and order room service."") It ended up being about 2.5 hours from the time we first tried to get food to the time we actually were eating (and at that point they brought the wrong dish, which had meat on it when we are vegetarians and asked them to not put on the meat.)

The location is pretty decent; very walkable area, lots happening, a little convenience store nearby, some cool restaurants, etc.

Overall I'd probably recommend this hotel, but if you happen to be staying on a peak night or when there are special events going on, I'd definitely recommend making sure there won't be any anomalous changes to their offerings.",3,2016,03,04
12,Great for work and pleasure!,Recently stayed at the Crown Plaza Barcelona for a conference.  It is a short walk to the metro which takes you to the Rambles in 3 stops.  Or you can walk from Plaza Espana to Plaza Catalunya in about 25 minutes.  The hotel is well set up for conferences and snacks and breakfast buffet was good.  The breakfast are does get quite loud in the morning though.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful with all of our questions.,4,2016,03,01
12,"Wow,so big rooms?","Attended convention at Barcelona and stayed at this hotel.
Must say,  excellent staff, great food, wow rooms, big! Amazing meeting space. 

Location wise located at fire area and is well connected with city also tourist areas.
Great spread of breakfast catering to both veggies and non veg tastes.
",4,2016,02,29
12,"Excellent all round service, cant complaint of anything","Excellent service from all staff members, in spite of the fact that the hotel was full of people because of the Mobile World Congress, Check in was done in a blaze, given a nice room. Internet speed was very good, breakfast spread was excellent and staff showed a genuine caring attitude all through. Good location as well- just 5 mins wlak to Plaza Espanya. Will love to stay here again.",5,2016,02,28
12,"Excellent Staff, Great Location","My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 02/06 to 02/13.  It was a very pleasant experience.  

The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Carina (I may not spell her name correctly, sorry.) who is from Austria.  She went above and beyond whenever we asked for help more than once.  Thank you! Carina.  

The location of this hotel is super.  Few minutes to the Metro and literally just a few steps to the Magic Fountain and the National Catalunya Art Museum.  There are a lot attractions in Montjuic district in walking distance from the hotel and yet it is quiet.  The room we had was spacious and well kept.  We definitely will stay there next time we visit Barcelona.",4,2016,02,20
12,Relaxing stay,"My partner and I stayed here for a night after our long trip from Badajoz, Portugal and Madrid before we went on to our journey to Paris. The hotel was very clean and relaxing. Staff were very friendly. 

Though the morning we were to check out of the hotel - there was no water. Apparently, they were doing some renovations/maintenance and the waterline to our room was affected. Though the staff offered us to use the Spa for us to refresh, As a 5 star hotel this kind of situation shouldn't have happened.

Otherwise, we wouldn't hesitate staying in this hotel again if we are back in Barcelona.",4,2016,02,10
12,Great stay,"My family and have been to Barcelona three times now and have always stayed in different hotels. This one in particular was very nice, and had great service. The rooms very very modern and well kept and very spacious so great for people travelling with more than two people. Its location is very close to a main plaza which is great for nighttime strolls and sight seeing. I would definitely recommend upgrading to having access to the club lounge where there is almost always appetizers, or various food options and an open bar. This was great for our family when needing to have a quick bite to eat before leaving or if we wanted a place to sit and relax before heading out. Overall great hotel and great visit!",5,2016,02,09
12,Great Romantic Vacation,The Crowne Plaza is located away from the other hotels in Barcelona. We actually found it a great location to walk to many local restaurants and some sites. It is very easy to get transportation as well. The hotel is very comfortable.,4,2016,02,08
12,Exellence All Round,"Arrived here on the 8th January for a 5 night stay, we were greeted by a lovely bubbly receptionist, given a lovely suite which was superb there was a Bathroom, Shower room, Living Room with office space and a lovely Bedroom, the whole room was spotless as is the entire Crowne Plaza, the Club Lounge is so tranquil and relaxing, you could either be in the side with the television or sit in the main bit with views over the street and the girls who look after you are all fantastic, absolutely nothing is a problem to them, so so helpful, the nibbles they put out for afternoon tea and late evening are delicious and in the morning the Club Lounge Breakfast has a vast layout from Fresh Fruit, several different types of Fruit Juice, cheese, meat, yoghurts, salmon, eggs, bacon, sausages etc.... to numerous to mention them all, served with Fresh Tea or Coffee. It was so good at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona that we returned for a one night stay on the 24th January 2016, again there is absolutely nothing that this place could be faulted for, its just P*E*R*F*E*C*T. Thank you one and all for making our holiday so enjoyable. Harry & Hazel.",5,2016,02,08
12,Great Location,"The room was very comfortable and clean, with a  stocked fridge, and it was in a perfect location. Just down the street from the fountain light show (check schedule, as it only operates a few nights a week).  The bakery just outside had the best pastelillos for pennies!  Would stay here again on a visit to Barcelona. Felt safe. Hotel was updated with contemporary furnishings.",5,2016,02,07
12,"A sad but rich history, great walks, the sea and the sun.","Great room with all modern amenities. Clean and well decorated with a comfortable lounger and a  flat screen television. Water replenished daily, as well as the coffee, tea and complimentary chocolates and biscuits. The bathroom was spacious with a separate shower and toilet. Although my room overlooked the street it was quiet. I stayed here for a conference and it was a good experience. The catered coffee breaks and lunches were excellent as was the breakfast and the one room service meal I ordered. The bar too was comfortable and not too expensive. The service at the  reception and in all areas of the hotel was friendly and efficient. The hotel is not in the city centre but it is a pleasant walk in and only 3 or 4 stops on the underground train to La Rambla. However, the National Gallery is only about a 5 minute walk away and well worth the visit. In addition turn right when you leave the hotel and you quickly arrive in a lively street with some great restaurants.",5,2016,02,04
12,Barcelona break!,"Close to many of the sights of Barcelona.  Friendly welcoming and worth the money.  Club lounge and floor were excellent standard, with helpful staff and a good selection of snacks and drinks.  Good base for Barcelona without being too central.",5,2016,02,04
12,Fabulous overnight stay,"We diverted to Barcelona due to an air traffic control strike in France.  Unfortunately we only got to stay at this hotel for one night.  We travel a lot and can honestly say that this was the friendliest front desk we have ever found.  Nothing was too much trouble even though they were fairly busy with some a big conference going on. They made us very welcome, gave us maps and directions to make the most of our unexpected one night in Barcelona.   The room was fab - only on the 3rd floor so not such spectacular views but it more than made up for it with the facilities in the room.  A very comfortable stay and we will be back as soon as possible.",5,2016,02,03
12,Excellent for Business Travelers,"The location is good, the hotel is clean and the rooms are quite spacious.  I accompanied my husband while he was in the city for business.  It an easy mile or so walk to the train station and several great sites in the city.  The breakfast in the morning is substantial and certainly suited to American travelers.  The price was also great.",4,2016,01,23
12,It was a great experience ,"Stayed there for a week and we loved it.
The location was perfect not far from the Espanya Metro station which takes you any where you want to.
The staff were friendly and helpful expect in a day I needed to make a local phone call from the reception because I had an appointment and my own phone was out of battery but they refused to let me make it.
I was so disappointed and l didn't like them not being helpful !
Nonetheless I will come back to the hotel when l visit Barcelona again.",5,2016,01,20
12,Exellant,"This was my third stay at this Hotel and impressions have been positive on all occasions. Larger than average rooms, new enough to still feel 'new', very clean with striking minimalist design. If you can upgrade to include use of the Club Lounge, good quality albeit small selection of food in the evening right up to 10.00pm including drinks. Staff are very polite and helpful. This Hotel is near enough to the centre of town (taxi rank bang outside the door) to feel central however far away enough to get out of the city in a rush. Well worth it.",5,2016,01,19
12,Very good location,"Stayed here for a few days over New Year.
The hotel is located just a few minutes from the Placa Espanya  which has metro and railway links to the city and surrounding area. Its also 10 minutes walk from the stop for the airport shuttle. Taxis are always available outside the hotel.
Trains leave from the local station as well for Montserrat which is less than an hour away.
The Placa Espanya is a huge square with shops, offices, bars and restaurants surrounding it plus the Fira conference and exhibition centre. The old bullring has been converted into a shopping centre,and is an attractive building.. We found the area fascinating to wander around and it felt very safe. The Monjuic Fountains are on an avenue leading away from the square and two mintues walk from the hotel. We walked to the Ramblas and historic centre in 30 minutes.
There are restaurants, cafes for breakfast or coffee and supermarkets all within walking distance 
The hotel is modern and has all the facilities you might expect from this brand.
The staff were warm in their welcome. Our room had a fantastic view of Monjuic Hill and the New Year's Eve fireworks and fountains. It was well equipped with beds so comfortable. The bathroom had good lighting and a fantastic walk in shower.
Our room was very clean although items of litter and dirty glasses were not removed and we had no pods for the Nepresso coffee machine provided for our three day stay. These we had to request.
There is a business centre on the ground floor with eight PCs.
Would we stay again, absolutely.",4,2016,01,17
12,Love the location,My family had the best experience here! It is in walking distance to almost anything and best of all right next to the Magic Fountain Montjuic we never missed a moment! across from there is all transportation! It was perfect with taxi cabs right out front to take you where you need to go! Great room Great Service,4,2016,01,14
12,Excellent 'business' hotel - quiet and with all,"Very high quality hotel with spacious rooms, attentive service and nice restaurant. Rooms are nicely styled , with high quality products and a very comfortable. The staff are attentive and helpful and french / english speaking (next to Spanish / Catalan).  what a nice contrast to the city of Barcelona where i was robbed - again.",4,2016,01,14
12,Great Hotel - Great Location,"Stayed in the crowne plaza for 2 nights in January and loved every second. We were upgraded to a suite with a massive bed and a smart tv large enough I could see it from the next building! The staff were very friendly and we had a meal in the restaurant which was top class and a welcome change form all the tapas. Free wifi everywhere and had full use of their business centre. Located just around the corner from the ""Espanya"" metro stop which will take you anywhere in the city in minutes, and there is a taxi rank right outside the door if needed. We walked to the marina and beach one day which took us about half an hour but didn't mind as it was 20 degrees. The hotel is also a 10 minute walk to the beautiful art museum and Olympic stadium which are worth seeing and then we took the gondola up to the castle - a truly amazing city and hotel and we will be back shortly!",5,2016,01,13
12,Warm surprise in a great location!,"Hotel was very accomodating, large room-we were upgraded to a penthouse suite upon signing up for their loyalty program. Excellent room, staff was very friendly and personable, and helped us along way to find great eateries in the neighborhood and enjoy the sights around the holiday season. Great location, as it is steps away from the Montjuic Magic Fountain and other great attractions around the area (Plaza Espana, MNAC, and other great museums and cultural sights).",4,2016,01,11
12,Very good large modern hotel,Stayed here for a couple of weekdays whilst travelling as a tourist to see Barcelona. The hotel may have a bit of a business feel but it fulfilled all our needs really well for a few days. It is crisp and modern and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. To be expected from Crowne Plaza. It is a 5-6 min walk down to the Placa D'Espayna underground station that provides excellent links around Barcelona. Also with 10-15 min walk are lots of restaurant choices from back street to mainstream. It would certainly have my recommendation.,4,2016,01,09
12,"Great staff, great room, great location","We've stayed this last summer in July and it couldn't of been better. The room was huge, super clean, very good quality furb, staff was excellent, very friendly and the location was excellent, often, on our way home at night we ran into small neighbourhood parties which were absolutely fascinating.",5,2016,01,07
12,"Friendly Staff, Great Hotel,Great location.","Other reviews have already said it, so I will too.Friendly Staff, Great Hotel, Great location. We were here for the New Year celebrations & my wife's birthday. We were able to watch the fireworks from our bedroom window. The rooms were very comfortable & well equipped. The Magic Fountains are only a short walk away from the hotel. We went with our daughter who loved being there too. I wish we able to take the name of one particular member of staff on Reception as she was very helpful & recommended a couple of Restaurants, which were perfect. We would defiantly stay here again if we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,01,06
12,Very good stay,"Stayed in a king room with sofa bed. Huge very comfortable bed, bathroom with separate shower and bath, comfy reclining chair good coffee and free water. Mostly quiet (except new years eve which was to be expected). Excellent, helpful staff (especially on reception and in lobby) and high quality free business centre and wifi. Decor is tasteful, though tailored to business so a bit subdued. 

No major complaints just a few minor niggles. The hotel is new and build standards are good but already slapdash maintenance man is starting to make his mark. Why can no Spanish hotels seem to employ anyone who can paint a ceiling without going over on to the walls, or apply bathroom sealant in a straight line?  Breakfast is overpriced at 18 euros and very crowded when I was there. No nespresso capsules in the room when I arrived and was charged 6 euros for a snack from the minibar I didnt take.  Overall though happy with the stay.",4,2016,01,06
12,Breakfast with Cava,"Friendly staff and atmosphere, big, clean, comfortable room, recognised as the largest in the city, standard rooms are 44m2.
Traditional food is delicious, you can try the restaurant in the hotel.
The breakfast with cool Cava is unforgettable.
Try it, you will not be disappointed",5,2016,01,05
12,Convenient,"We stayed during a fair in this hotel and were updated to a suite with big meeting and sitting room. It was very convenient during the fair to have s possibility for s private meeting at the hotel!
The hotel is located just outside the fair so you have the possibility to get over for a short break any time!
For sightseeing a little to far from the fury center but close to Mointjuic",4,2016,01,03
12,Great hotel and friendly helpful staff,A fantastic hotel. The team at the front desk were always friendly and very helpful. A special thanks to Jaume and Karina for their great advice which added to our holiday. Great location for Camp Nou (half an hour walk after game) and close to Monjuic and New Year celebrations. Less than 10 mins walk to metro for access to main town. Highly recommended. ,5,2016,01,02
12,"Great. Clean and newly renovated hotel, with very satisfying ammenities.","I stayed two wonderful nights in here. 
 - Location : very satisfying - around there lots of fancy (=yummy) restaurants and famous tapas bars. Monjuic fountain is also 5-minute by walk.
 - View : not as good as I expected, only I can see the ongoing-construction building through my window (2015. June).Actually building itself is 7~8 floor high so someone can't expect the city view
 - Room condition - (except less being luxurious), 5 star qulity
 - Breakfast  - fair enough
 - Staff - of course - very kind",4,2015,12,31
12,Understated and great,"I had booked the hotel at the last moment. Though I am a member of the IHG group of hotels and have stayed in their hotels, I was a bit unsure about this one as rooms were still available during the Christmas holidays. It turned out to be quite a memorable and pleasant experience.
It's not located in a bustling and crowded area and yet easy to access, some 7-10 minutes walk from two metro stations. As metro is one of the easiest, economical and convenient means of transport, that's a great advantage.
The room was huge for us, a family of three. I haven't seen anything equivalent in Europe for the published rates. Even with a king size bed and a sofa bed, there was plenty of room to move around. Same about the bathroom.
We had decided to have our breakfast in the hotel itself because of the convenience. Had a decent range and the quite some space. Even with the massive dining space, it did tend to get crowded because of the holiday season. We also had Christmas dinner at the restaurant 'El Halle' which was also excellent.
It's located close (walking distance)  to some of the tourist spots like Poble Espanyol and Placa Espanya. The Font Magica (Magical Fountain) is located in the next block and seemed to be the most crowded attractions I noticed during the trip.
Excellent and very helpful staff.
Will like to mention two incidents which I have never encountered before and that made it more remarkable. 
The last night I was not feeling well (too much of good food!!!!). It being Sunday and a public holiday (27th December) I was not sure where to get hold of any medicines. I called the reception and asked them if they could arrange for the medicines. They sent a staff to nearest open pharmacy to get the medicines.
The second one was about my camera battery charger. As soon as I reached home, I realized that I had left it behind at the hotel. I sent an email to them to confirm and they managed to locate and send it over to me (in transit now).",5,2015,12,30
12,perfect retreat,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights - was a great hotel with very friendly staff and very good service all round. The room size is very generous and very clean. the breakfast is adequate - not amazing but what you would expect and the location is really good and close to some major tourist attractions and the metro which is very handy. all in all a great stay and would highly recommend.,5,2015,12,30
12,Great hotel,"This is a great 4* hotel. It is close to the Pl. Espagna so it's central. The rooms are big and comfortable and the staff is great . The breakfast is lovely , the food is of a great variety. It is very clean and well managed. The only negative would be that the walls are slim and you can hear noise from other rooms but that's wasn't too much of a problem for me. I will stay here again.",5,2015,12,28
12,Xmas in Barcelona,"WOW what an outstanding welcome and the stay was even better.
As a platinum member I have tried many many hotels throughout the world with IHG and this place is the best Crowne Plaza that we have stayed in, from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out the service was absolutely 1st class.
During check we were speedily processed very efficiently and then we were met by the hotel Manager Miguel which was a very pleasant experience as he was very knowledgeable and informative regarding the area and places to visit.
The business lounge and service were excellent with a great choice of breakfast/snacks & drinks.
Room was spacious and very comfortable as well as quiet.
 
We will return in the not too distant future.",5,2015,12,28
12,Excellent hotel; loved every part except the pool/spa!,"I stayed in this hotel while on business in Barcelona during October 2015. I loved the hotel and the amenities that it offered but was disappointed to find that the spa/gym was charged for on a daily basis. Perhaps this is detailed on the hotel website but it was was booked on my behalf and I was not advised of this surcharge prior to visiting...either I need a new P.A. or the hotel needs to more clearly state this information on their website! My room was fantastic - one of the largest I have ever experienced and I would go as far as to say the largest room in a Catalonia hotel. I slept exceptionally well and enjoyed the breakfast that was on offer each morning. In terms of location, it may not be ideal for those travelling for the central Barcelona sights but it was perfect for me while I was on business. The public transport throughout the city is good (and cost effective) so travelling down to the beach or the central attractions is not a problem from this hotel. I actually quite enjoyed being slightly further out from the city center to enjoy some peace and quiet after the hustle and bustle of central Barca. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and this hotel comes highly recommended from a seasoned business and leisure traveler.",5,2015,12,27
12,"Excellent hotel, perfect stuff","Just came back from Holiday vacation in Barcelona with my wife, 2 daughters and my parents, and we did stay 4 nights in Crown Plaza Fira Center.
From arrival we did feel the great service the stuff are giving, all the family did like it, you feel more than welcome, 
As IHG Platinum member they upgraded both our rooms to suites, and to the best view. they gave us free upgrade to the club Lounge which was available for us from 07:00 am to 23:00 PM. including breakfast in the morning and Tapas in the noon time and evening, also included VIP assistance who helped us with any information requested about the city. So thanks to Marcal, Maria in the club Lounge and to Tadzio in the Reception.
Location:
Before arrival I was worry that its far from the La Ramlas, but this was ok. for us as family with 2 kids we needed anyway to use Taxis, we used big taxis for 6 people, and this was very comfortable, and easy - cost between 8 to 15 Euro to all around the city rarely more. its about 700 meters from the Plaza Espania, so its also doable by Metro from there to anywhere you need.
I am flying a lot in business trips, and getting also very nice service, but when doing that with the family and getting that amazing service sure I appreciated that much more.",5,2015,12,24
12,Great Hotel,"Very close to Plaza Espanol. Large rooms with both a bathtub and separate shower. Didn't have the breakfast as i was running late in the morning.. but in terms of sleep and cleanliness its perfect. I had food in the restaurant the night i was there, wouldnt recommend, but its a personal choice and I'm quite fussy with food. Enjoy!",5,2015,12,18
12,Very impressive,"Staff were lovely and very welcoming. The room was huge, Kingsize bed and a large single sofa bed. Spotless , Tea and coffe facilities..Bathroom was very modern and again huge. Great location within walking distance to las ramblas.Next to the magic fountain which was magical.
I would definitely stay here again.We loved it.",5,2015,12,17
12,Ideally Located,"Firstly greeted by very friendly, helpful staff upon arrival. The room we had was massive and extremely comfortable and was a great room to finish our 6 week holiday through Europe. Very clean and well presented throughout the whole place. The breakfast was awesome great variety of food and kept fresh regularly. Ideal location for some of the major attractions such as the Magic fountain of Montjuic, the Olympic stadium and venues etc etc. Very close to the public transport and several very good restaurants close by.",5,2015,12,15
12,Nice hotel ,"Very spacious and clean. Staffs are polite and helpful. Walking distance to the metro station, national museum and the magic fountain. The amenities are good. Did not have a chance to use the restaurant. Not far from the pier of the cruise lines. Highly recommended",5,2015,12,09
12,Acceptable business hotel if you are staying near for a conference,"Nothing special, but it is clean, quiet and the staff is helpful.  If I had to give them one area to improve it would be the pillows - even requesting a feather pillow ended up with something harder than you should put your head on.  Not much near the area so stay there if that is where you need to be, otherwise I would look more towards city center",3,2015,12,04
12,"Spent two nights here visiting the city before leaving for a Med cruise. Excellent facility, great resturants close by.","Friendly, helpful front desk...excellent, modern rooms and amenities. Convenient location from airport and sea port. Quiet, restful rooms. Many restaurants within easy walking distance. Short distance from city hop on-hop off bus.",5,2015,12,02
12,Good value,"Stayed two nights and have no complaints really. One elevator was out of drift, but they compensated by opening the service elevator. Beds were good and the room was modern with a spacious bathroom. I visited the spa as well (entry is not included in the room rate), and it was nice.

Overall I felt this place delivered and the price was not bad at all.

Five minute walk to Poble Sec-metro station and the Placa Espanya is also close.",4,2015,12,01
12,Exceptional stay:  the property and service exceeded expectations!,"I had the pleasure to stay 3 nights at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona for a business conference.  I frankly chose the hotel as it was one of the few left near the conference center but was recommended by the conference organizer.  It was truly a 5 star experience and I don't dole out the 5th star lightly, as you can see from my past reviews.   The key factors that won me over were the well appointed room & fabulous bathroom, service/staff and a surprisingly delightful breakfast (well priced for a top hotel).

The room was much larger than a typical European hotel room, lots of good lighting, free wifi (although had to keep signing in every day I came back to the room), quiet with good locking mechanisms (good for women travelers!) and a huge bathroom, chicly designed with a separate shower stall and a tub that I woke up early for!

During my stay I had to ship conference items back to the US with FedEx.  The effort was more complicated than I thought and I was so lucky to have Nouria help me thru the process.  My first encounter with her during check in was delightful - very pleasant, efficient and clearly very smart and on her game.  By phone I had to call the hotel when I encountered the shipping issues and she came to my rescue and took care of everything.   What a huge support effort that was for me during my stay.

The spa is really worth using.  The swim/sauna fee I did not pay but I was able to enjoy a massage with Niva, which was remarkable!

While the location may not be in key tourist and shopping areas, it's actually a quiet and safe location so I would recommend coming here as a home base as taxis were plentiful at the hotel and seemed to be reasonably priced to get to anywhere in the city.

This was a wonderful experience, one of my favorite business trips yet, and most of it is owed to the Crowne Plaza Barcelona.",5,2015,11,24
12,Would come back again,"We stayed here for 4 nights for leisure. The room size is huge as well as the bathroom and the TV screen. The amenities and supplies were of an excellent quality, all free trade friendly. The service was good and the staff were friendly and pleasant. We are an IHG club members so we enjoyed the use of the lounge on level A. We had our breakfast there too; buffet style with a waitress for coffee and plate clearing. No one to prepare the egg for you the way you like but it was ok. The place is a short walk to placa d' Espanya and Arenas shopping mall. Plenty of restaurants around the corner and along the main street. Taxis available at the entrance. The internet needed to be reset regularly, nevertheless it was satisfactory for our kind of use. We would go back there again.",4,2015,11,22
12,Praises to Tadzio (the assistant manager)!,"Firstly a big shout out to the hotel staff especially Tadzio (assistant manager) and the hotel manager. They have been extremely helpful during a frustrating, stressful situation we have landed ourselves in. My partner and I stupidly missed our flight back home.

We rushed back to the hotel and queued up at the desk, waiting for help.  There was a small queue and thought we would have to wait quite a bit to get urgent help.  However thankfully, the hotel manager approached us and asked if we were ok?. We explained our situation and he acted very professional and calm for us, which we really needed! And also he knew the urgency of us finding the next flight out back to home.  

We could not understand Spanish when on the phone to a lady, however Tadzio the assistant manager saved the day.  He translated and referred all the info to us, what the airline company was saying to him, giving us options of what flights we could take.  He was also searching for potential flights for us on his computer.  In the end we managed to find a flight because of Tadzio's effort. 

We never felt left alone by the staff.  They knew to sort out our problem as soon as possible for us.  So Tadzio, thank you so much!!!",5,2015,11,22
12,"Very good hotel, but with some service gaps","Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel on a mixed trip, personal/relaxing with my wife and also business trip.  Hotel is very well located, very close to the Plaza España, the shopping mall Arenas, and also a very quick taxi ride to the downtown or the beach area.  To/from the airport is about a 20 mis taxi ride, so all good in terms of location.

Room is big, clean, well equipped, comfortable king size bed, a huge TV and very silent in the night, assuring a very good sleep. Toilett is also clean, big and well equipped. Staff is very friendly and helpful

The negatives:
1. Internet connection is horrendous. The hotel uses a service provided named Kubi, the same one used in other places in Spain like the Business Lounges of Iberia in some airports, and the quality of connection is terrible.  To connect an IPhone or tablet and do basic surfing is ok, but to use a corporate latptop to work using some secure channels, quality of internet service offered by the hotel is very poor. They should offer something better, even for a fee.  I personally had a very hard time with the internet offered by the hotel.

2. There is an Espresso machine at the hotel, but after I used the capsels the first day of my stay, they were never replaced.  Issue is that I realised this in the morning, when wanted a good coffee before leaving, hence too late to call and ask for capsels. Bottom line, I had espresso only on my first day of stay.

3. On Tuesday Nov 10th, when I was checking out (around 8:00AM), the front desk was completely understaffed: only one person. I asked him to split my bill in 2, just to have my personal stay (first 2 days) separated from my business one, and it took him 10 mins to do it, All good, but in the meantime, a 7 persons queue was behind me waiting to check out.

All in all, a great stay in a very good hotel, but lack of attention to some minor details, create small service gaps which put this hotel definitely in a good cathegory, but not an excellent one.",4,2015,11,21
12,Superb Hotel,"Firstly, Bedrooms are huge (Also bathrooms). Staff (All English speaking) are very welcoming and helpful. Located right beside the convention center. You will need a taxi to bring you into the center of town (10 mins max). Ice machine on the floor. Convenience store right across the street selling everything at extremely good prices. Breakfast was just fantastic in the restaurant (Buffet + waiter coffee service). The Waiters were some of the best I have ever seen. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely return. Staff are 100%. Stay there. You will love it.",5,2015,11,20
12,"Gorgeous, Comfortable, Relaxing","This place is beautiful! Lots of space and excellent customer service. You feel as though you've stepped into a different world when you walk into this high-class hotel. Beautiful interior design and architecture, awesome looking restaurant (although we didn't eat the food), and an incredibly relaxing spa. The room was spacious and comfortable, with an amazing ambiance and fantastic amenities. The only thing I would change would be to have the spa area complimentary to hotel guests. That said, I would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,11,18
12,"Good hotel, nice rooms","I stayed here for 3 nights for a business trip. I thought I was near the Fira convention centre. But that has two locations and I was at the wrong one. The taxi ride is less than 10 minutes so not too problematic. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly  helpful staff. Good room with big tv screen. A few more international tv stations is the only improvement I see.
",4,2015,11,16
12,Great location- even better staff ,"As the subject says, this property is all about the staff... What wonderful treatment right from check-in!  Room service very prompt and generous portions.  Close to the magic fountain and Montjuic.   Wish we had more time... Off to our Med. cruise tmrw.   

Will be back!

-Enjoy",4,2015,11,14
12,Great hotel,"Great hotel , free wifi , 30 minutes from airport costs around $28 from the airport in a taxi. Lots of bars and tapas within short walk. Very clean rooms and very modern layout , like the fact it has sub sockets for charging. Restaurant in hotel is very good food and great for business travellers. ",4,2015,11,12
12,"Well located in nice area, close to magical water fountains","Decent hotel, nice spa although quite busy at timeshare, good massage.close to dancing musical water fountains , not far from arena shopping mall built in old bull fighting stadium. Taxi from airport around 15 euros, the old town las rambles about 10 euros, worth a visit. Breakfast running buffet finishes at 10:30 am",4,2015,11,11
12,"“ FANTASTIC HOTEL ""","If you can afford it, go for it, go for it. Highly recommended.
One of the best hotels we ever stayed. We stayed  for  a weekend with family.  
 The rooms very clean , the breakfast very rich, the staff  very, very friendly and professional , helpful and polite …including the Manager . We loved the VIP lounge upgrade  with excellent breakfast, drinks and tapas. 
Not to mention  the location within walking distance from the lovely Plaza “Espana “ which has connections to everything you need basically.  I hope to go back soon to wonderful  Barcelona and Crowne Plaza Fira Center !",5,2015,11,09
12,"Spacious, Immaculate and Comfortable","We were so pleased we chose this hotel for our four-day stay in Barcelona prior to a transatlantic cruise.    Our room and bathroom were a very generous size and the decor was modern.  We had every amenity to make us comfortable.  After a long day of sightseeing, it was great to have this hotel to come back to. 

The location is ideal.  The Magic Fountain is around the corner and the Metro just a couple of streets over to find your way to all the beautiful sights Barcelona has to offer.  The hop-on hop-off bus is also within walking distance.

The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is a mixture of businesses and residential.  There are lots of little sidewalk cafes and restaurants, including Bodega 1900, which is very close and which we enjoyed.  

We spent some time in the relaxing bar and though we did not try the restaurant except for breakfast, it was definitely first class.

We highly recommend this hotel.  The staff will make you feel most welcome.",5,2015,11,08
12,Nice beginning to our trip in Spain,"Stayed in room 650 which was a suite with a generous-sized bedroom and separate living room. There was also a balcony with a great view.  The bathroom was extremely nice with its separate shower, bath, toilet & bidet, plugs for appliances, and lots of storage for your stuff.  Self parking in the garage was included in the room price.  The hotel is a short walk to the Magic Fountain.  The only minus was the staff did not tell us about the special deal for the club until the next day so be sure to ask.  There is a small grocery across the street.",4,2015,11,06
12,Cool location and comfortable rooms,"Stayed here on a business trip and arrived past midnight at the hotel. I had a very friendly reception and got a brilliant room, very spacious. 
Staff was all very helpful. Especially at breakfast they gave me an assortment of gluten free rolls, croissants, pain au chocolats! Museu National D'Art de Catalunya is within walking distance and worth a visit!",5,2015,11,06
12,Quality Hotel,"Was here for a conference. Very lovely hotel, food good and loved the club lounge on Level A, well worth the upgrade for the free drinks and nibbles.

Plenty of seating area to crash out in. Breakfast good as well as the bar.",5,2015,11,01
12,Amazing hotel!,"I travel a lot with business and this is one of my favourite hotels. The room is simply enormous and decor is really luxurious. The hotel bar is excellent, staff unbelievably friendly. If you like gin, they have quite a selection and the barman was very helpful. Breakfast was excellent and the lunches were great too.",5,2015,10,29
12,Nice hotel for business travel,"Very Nice hotel for business travel, I found the room and bed comfortable , had a nice breakfast. I love the perfume they vaporize in the lobby :)
Hotel Closed to font magica de montjuic and plaza d' Espanya. Poble sec is the nearest subway station.",5,2015,10,29
12,Modern and comfortable,"We loved the room we had, very roomy with nice closets and amenities including coffee and tea paraphernalia in situ. The bathroom very modern and big with a door to separate the toilet for privacy. The front staff very nice and helpful including the manager. I also liked the spa which have reasonable prices. We loved the VIP lounge with excellent breakfast, drinks and tapas. The pillows are not great -Spanish type, thick, long sausages- but they had an American standard pillow in the closet and brought us an additional when we asked. Nice thin duvets in the beds. Their restaurant also very good with reasonable prices. ",4,2015,10,26
12,Definitely didn't disappoint,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. We are IHG platinum members and as such were upgraded to one of the club rooms. This was a welcomed benefit after being in a cramped cruise cabin for 12 nights.  The room was quite spacious, well appointed and modern.  It included bath robes and slippers, as an added bonus!

The hotel front desk and concierge was always helpful. While the location is a little outside of the main tourist areas, it was within walking distance of the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc.  We were also provided with directions to the local metro station nearby, so we could explore the city on our own. 

I can't comment on the restaurants as we chose to enjoy places outside of the hotel.",5,2015,10,20
12,Best choice in Barcelona,"We visited Barcelona for a double purpose. Our daughter had a conference in Fira de Barcelona, and we accompanied her because we wanted to see the city (for the first time). 
Our choice of the hotel was the best possible. 
Crowne plaza is situated just across Fira de Barcelona - and our daughter could attend her Conference easily - and also could come at the hotel, for a small rest, in the breaks. 
We were close to all attractions - and the Metro was the best option to explore all Barcelona center. 
We were close to Montjuic parc - which we loved in the morning - and we had a wonderful weather to explore the whole huge park - all the way to the sea. 

Hotel suite was comfortable, clean, quiet and restful. The check-in and out was easily, reception people very friendly and helpful, breakfast very good (we found options for each one of us - a vegan, a vegetarian and a ”normal” eater). 
We liked the position of the hotel, all its facilities and the general energy of people.",5,2015,10,19
12,Great Location near Plaza Espana and the Adria restaurants,I stayed at the hotel as it is near Avenue Parellel and Plaza Espana so very easy access to airport as the A1 and A2 buses stop about a 5 minute walk away. Room was excellent and large. It is very convenient to the shopping mall at the old bullring. It is a mile walk down very scenic Avenue Parallel to get to the Ramblas. It is very close to several amazing restaurants started in Barcelona by Albert and Ferran Adria. I highly recommend for Foodies.,5,2015,10,13
12,Weekend Luxury,"Really enjoyed a 2 night stay having upgraded to a Club Suite.
Club facilities excellent and could not fault the hotel in any way.
Very much a business hotel but still in a great position for holiday makers being within a 10 minute walk of trains, buses, galleries, shops and restaurants in an otherwise safe area.",5,2015,10,12
12,Exceeded My Expectations!,"Originally, I wanted to stay closer to the Gothic area of Barcelona, but couldn't find accommodations on such short notice. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center. The room was spacious, the buffet breakfast was good, and the staff were professionally hospitable. The architecture of the hotel itself didn't look like it belonged in Barcelona, but it had every amenity to make my stay comfortable: the room was clean, the beds were comfortable (with numerous pillow options), and there were so many perks - the nightly cookies on my pillow, the aromatherapy solutions at bedside, great wi-fi in the room and business center, environmentally conscientious toiletries, recycling, and more. As mentioned the staff were great, especially Sven at the front desk; if it weren't for him, I would not have made it to Sagrada Familia, which was the highlight of my 4 day trip to Barcelona. Although we mostly walked every where (the Gothic area was a 30 minute walk), there were always taxis in front of the hotel to take you where you needed to go. There were great restaurants, markets, and attractions in the 1 block radius around the hotel. Great location!",5,2015,10,11
12,Quality hotel in Barcelona,"Crowne Plaza Fira Center in Barcelona is a quality hotel near one of the congress buildings. 
- Nice & quiet hotel room. Unfortunately, I did not have a nice view over the windows.
- Good meeting facilities even for a large meeting
- Tasty lunches during the meetings days
- Polite staff
- Good gym
- Tasty breakfast buffet",4,2015,10,06
12,Great Hotel,"although its 4 Starr hotel, but does not feel like that... Great Room, Very Hygiene , great bed and mattress, excellent cover sheet, WIFI reception excellent, Specious room... Most important friendly staff, breakfast is good.  Close to the metro station, magic fountain, restaurant.",4,2015,10,04
12,Meetings and Incentives,"I do plan meetings all over the globe. The Crown Plaza Barcelona -  Fira Center offers great meeting space, outstanding service, and a great variety of selection of Banquet dining. If you are looking for a place to hold a successful meeting, The CROWN PLAZA  BARCELONA -  FIRA CENTER is the place.",4,2015,10,01
12,Extremely awesome ,The hotel has very nice location with close Metro station and shopping centers. The staff and managers are very pleasant. My room was upgraded to suite for my honey moon trip with complimentary sweets and drinks. Even the chef has magic touch food when we ordered for room service. Highly recommended ,5,2015,10,01
12,Jamil,"Very central location. Good facilities. Love gym, suna and breakfast. 
Well mannered front desk staff. 
Easy access to metro & all other public transport. 
Will definitely stay again. 
Easy approach to n from sea front. Lots of good restaurants near by. 
If you fancy swimming then it's not a hotel for you, because it does not have a pool. 
Price wise it's not too competitive but it does offer good packages on n off.",5,2015,09,30
12,Great hotel but...,"Close to 5/5 but just cannot make it. Negative side is location away from the city centre and room cleannes.
Size of the room was extra large and all kind of amenities was provided. Crew was also helpfull and all requests was supported. For transportation purposes there is metro but one need to walk few  blocks. 
Breakfast had standard Crowne Plaza service level.",4,2015,09,29
12,The best hotel,"We were greeted by a very warm and friendly receptionist.  She quickly acknowledged that we were platinum members. She informed us of  all our benefits. We also received a letter the next morning reminding us of our extra benefits. We were given a choice of which room we wanted. Everyone that we spoke to in the hotel could not have been nicer. The room was clean and all furniture was comfortable. Amenities were superb. Lighting superior to most hotels.also nice touch to have a lighted mirror to apply make-up. We very much enjoyed our stay. 
Iendly",5,2015,09,29
12,Lovely break,We stayed in the hotel a few years ago and it has been upgraded since then.the room was lovely with an enormous bed which was very comfortable.The only problem was the cold breakfast this was unfortunately the same last time!!!,4,2015,09,28
12,Sumptuous rooms and excellent location,"We arrived after an early morning flight and were very grateful that we could check in immediately and relax in a 2 double bedroom.  The room was very large with comfortable chairs and a table besides the 2 very large beds.  Free wifi was appreciated so that we could plan what to do and where to eat.  The bathroom was luxurious and I liked how the toilet + bidet was separated from the shower and main bathroom.
Reception were very helpful, providing a map and telling us how to get around, especially as we had booked tickets to see the Basilica Sagrada Familia including how to use the metro and the best way of paying for public transport.
This hotel is well-situated near to the Magic Fountains and metro stops.  We caught the Aerobus from the airport and got off at the Pl. d'Espanya.  It is only about a 10-15 minute walk.  I would suggest not going over the bridges to the fountains but cross the road if you have luggage.  There are a number of steps to get back to street level.
We didn't eat in the hotel as there are so many good eating places near by.
Only annoyance was that there was not a bin in the room.",4,2015,09,28
12,Nice property,"The rooms are very nice; large, modern, comfortable and upscale.  The location is also excellent. Request a room that is not close to the elevators for a more peaceful stay. The staff is very accommodating and helpful with directions or reservations. ",4,2015,09,27
12,not as clean as it looks and so not family friendly,"i stayed in this hotel only for one night my husband had a meeting there .i stayed there with my baby and husband . yes the room was large and yes it's cloe to many attractions but it's not as clean as it looks my one year old son is now in the age of picking things up . when we were in our room he picked something and put it in his mouth luckily i was next to him and got it out it turned out to be a pill that someone before us dropped it and it wasn't cleaned .. when i told the staff they just said we're sorry , i asked for a doctor they said ther wasn't any it was only when a manager afternoon that she called a doctor .that was bad thank god nothing happened to the baby they didn't offer any compensattion(though i only cared qabout my son i didn't ask anything but i they should've offered). and also it's so not family friendly don't come here with your family no pool nothng not even a good restaurant for kids i had to bring food from the hotel.and true it's close to attraction but not the ramblas and only the top rooms were with vi",3,2015,09,26
12,Nice hotel with large rooms,"It is a Crown Plaza for those loyal to IHG. The rooms are quiet large and very comfortable. It is very near the Montjuic fountains. There is a stop for the Touristic Bus around 500 meters. We recommend the small pastry shop just facing it for morning breakfast. 
We had 2 rooms for a family of 5. Reception was quick and the stay was great as well. 
One tip: choose an inside room which is quiet calm far from the noises of the road. ",5,2015,09,25
12,Great rooms and good location,"The hotel is only steps away from Plaza España with metro and other means of transportation.  Also from Montjiuk Palace which is a main atraction in Barcelona and site of numerous events at the Olympics in the nineties.  Also the Plaza de Toros now converted in a nice shopping center as bullfighting is prohibited in Catalunya.  The rooms are spacious and the service great.  A good business center and lounge. As a Platinum member I was upgraded in my room, but not allowed in the lounge like in other Crowne Plaza I have stayed.  Good bathrobe and great ammenities.  Plenty of restaurant options, mainly at Arenas, the old bullfighting plaza.
Fira, the Convention Center in Barcelona is just across the street.",5,2015,09,25
12,A Memorable Stay,"Escaping from my miserable stay at the Four Points, I did not know that I was entering the lap of luxury with staff who literally welcome you with open arms and helpful in every way possible. We had a family suite and wow what a room. Felt very spacious with the 3 of us in the room. My son had his own sofa bed facing the TV and a separate bedroom for ourselves. With access to the Club Lounge at all hours of the day to the breakfast served everyday, it was a treat indeed. The wifi worked very well. Location is good. Would definitely stay here again. This hotel was one of the highlights of our Barcelona trip.",5,2015,09,24
12,Really friendly and helpful top class hotel,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff were so friendly and helpful and not being able to speak Spanish was never a problem.We were in Barcelona for three nights in a twin room .the room it's self had plenty of space a very comfortable .the hotel is in a really great location for going to the football,beach and other sites.I would really recommend it to anyone.fantasic thank you so much",5,2015,09,23
12,"Smart, expansive, and upmarket hotel","Quality throughout, very helpful staff. Excellent in-house restaurant. Room outstanding, with Smart 55@ LED TV (the first for me!), bed exceptionally comfortable. Bathroom has everything, separate shower & bath.",5,2015,09,22
12,Standard fare 5* Hotel in good location and walking distance to many attractions,"The hotel has large pleasant rooms (standard 5*) as well as a nice gym. The hotel is very convenient for walking to many of the attractions with the Catalan Art Museum and beautiful parks just at the side of the hotel as well as the night time water fountain light show which is 2 mins walk away. Barcelona is very walkable and from the hotel one can walk to las Ramblas, the Gothic and Gaudi areas as well as the harbour and taxis are easy to find and the Metro is close by. The rooms were very comfortable and wifi adequate and breakfast was reasonable though nothing special. The hotel has a spa area (large jacuzzi, sauna etc.) but annoyingly this requires a fee.",4,2015,09,14
12,beware of theft from your room,"This is a nice ****s hotel. For room 535 (no view) we paid over 250 euro per night for 4 nights during a congres. Please note that the new Fira is located outside of town, and is NOT CLOSE to the hotel. The hotel is located closely to the old Fira.
The hotel has large up to date rooms, a huge TV, crappy free wifi, average breakfast (many items were finished at 9), a nice gym, but no outside room to spend the evening. (all of this has been written before). The bad: probably you'll even have to store your cosmetics inside of the safe box, because a mascara roller was stolen from our room. The hotels respose while complaining at the front desk: 'we're sorry', case closed. So beware.",3,2015,09,12
12,Good hotel - restaurant staff ruined our final evening,"Positives: great room - large with wonderful views (we were on the sixth floor). Room was clean and bed was really comfortable. Buffet breakfast was really nice - especially the orange juice.
Negatives: Quite expensive and really difficult to get coffee and tea served at breakfast. The staff had to provide tea and coffee from jugs and they were very busy most of the time. It would make more sense to have tea and coffee available as part of the buffet so guests can help themselves.
Hotel restaurant: we ate here on Monday (9th September 2015) and waiters were excellent - couldn't do enough for you. We also enjoyed the food. We therefore decided to eat here again on Thursday (10th September) and the experience was awful. Waiters were rude and dismissive. We had to ask for the fixed price menu as they seemed determined that guests should only eat off the a la carte menu. When we asked to pay for additional wine that was not included in the fixed price menu, this caused confusion and waiters clearly understood very little English even though hotel is advertised as English speaking. I can understand why they found it irritating that we spoke very little Spanish but I don't think we deserved to be treated with such open contempt. We noticed that other English speaking guests were also treated with open irritation and the two waiters kept disappearing completely from the restaurant for some reason. Spanish speaking guests were treated completely differently so I would recommend that you only try the restaurant if you speak fluent Spanish in case you get the waiters we had on Thursday night. It is a shame because the food was really good in the restaurant.",3,2015,09,11
12,2 night stay before a crusie,"We stayed at this hotel as it was located close to the port. We arrived in Barcelona by train and it was very easy to get a cab to the hotel. Cabs were always at the hotel if you should need them, and if there were none the hotel guest service agents were more than happy to call one for you. The hotel was right beside the magic fountains that had a light show on every night that we were there, and close to the Placa Espanya. We were able to walk to the beach and the rambla, the only down side was that all the restaurants located near the hotel were closed until around 7pm, which took some getting used to.",5,2015,09,09
12,Great room in good location,"Perfect hotel accommodations close to Barcelona attractions, Placa Espanya, magic fountains and Arenas shopping center.  Bed was incredibly comfortable and room was large, well appointed and quiet.

Bathroom was also large with shower and bath and fine bathroom supplies.  The sleep aroma kit was a nice touch! Perfectly relaxing.

Enjoyed the the restaurant and room service for dinner and both were fine and efficient, and bar area had a romantic ambiance. The breakfast buffet is well worth the price for the selection.",5,2015,09,09
12,"Modern hotel, in convenient area","Enjoyable stay here for one night before joining cruise ship. Hotel is clean, modern and spacious. The lobby bar is great place to relax and people watch. The bartender there makes a very nice gin and tonic!",4,2015,09,08
12,an excellent hotel. very nice room. a reference in barcelona,"the hotel is conveniently located. very clean and well maintained. the staff at check in is very efficient and courteous. the room was superb. 2 large beds. excellent mattress, and soft bed sheets. little attentions like some spray for the pillow.
i asked to have some dry cleaning today, and the dry cleaning is closed on the week end. they did every effort possible to find a solution. finally they irened my jacket/suit to help me and left a little note in the room to appologize for not being to dry clean it but ireoned it free of charge. very professional. 
TV screen is enormous, and has multi features. bathroom is nice with separate shower and bath tub. amenities of quality.
Wifi works perfectly and is free.
the breakfast is of good quality. they have a good choice of food, the orange juice is so good, and their expresso was a delight (i took 2..)
this is a hotel i am happy to recommend for either a business trip or a leisure trip.
thank you for making my stay so nice",5,2015,09,05
12,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"We were very fortunate to stay at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Barcelona. It is well situated near to the Arenas shopping centre and metro stations. Our room was beautifully decorated,  spacious and immaculate. We even had sheep shaped biscuits on our pillows each night. The Club Lounge was a great retreat and the staff there extremely helpful.  Not only did they explain the local area to us, but also helped us to select a flameco show which authentic and spectacular. I would heartily recommend this hotel, it is outstanding in every way !",5,2015,09,05
12,Good location for the Montjuic area,"hotel is just opposite the fira centre which is the main convention centre. My british airways flight was in the morning and I had informed them of my early arrival and they accommadated me in the morning itself - excellent service. The reception staff was very helpful fluent in english and went out of the way to recommend local restaurants to eat and a model iteninary. Infound the staff very accommadating and very helpful with my myriad of doubt and questions. Thank you all.
There is a taxinstand outside the hotel. it is about €30 from airport to hotel. Almost everywhere it is cheaper to go by taxi as we were three (including my 14 year old son) and it usually cost less than €10
The room is spacious with separte bath and shower. The breakfast was usually stuff nothing special. The cofee service is slow and once the capuccino came after we all finished breakfast and had to decline. We had dinner once in teh restaurant, it very cosy and very beautiful. The choice was limited but quite good to our palate.
Montjuic area is very good with the magic fountain a stone throw away and the castle, the olypic park, the national museum and the plaza espana all walking distance from hotel. We used google maps to guide us all along and the views were breath taking.
will definitely recommend this hotel as a base for barcelona sight seeing.",4,2015,09,05
12,Great place to stay!,"The location was more central than we thought at first, as it turned out to be quite close to everything we needed. The rooms were fantastic, kept in good shape throughout our stay. The staff were extremely helpful and really informative. The hotel had everything we could want, except for a pool, which would have been nice. The beds were very comfortable and the TV as well as the view were pretty spectacular.
The gym was beyond my expectations as it was filled with extremely impressive features which made exercising a lot more fun and enjoyable.",4,2015,09,03
12,Enjoyed location and attentive staff,"Arriving at the hotel mid evening after a long flight we were surprised be escorted by friendly version reception staff to the Club Lounge for check in.  We were provided with relaxing service by Rafael that set an extremely high standard of service that was maintained throughout our stay by Alex and Mario.  The hotel can be justifiably proud of these members of staff.

We enjoyed an upgraded corner one bedroom suite with a balcony.  Room was spacious and well appointed with 2 large flat screen TV screens.  Particularly enjoyed the bathroom layout with separate shower cubicle and bathtub as well as a bidet. Comfortable bed with adequate lighting. 

Would definitely stay here again if visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,09,01
12,Great accomodation,Spent 3 nights int Crowne Plaza. Great location with nice rooms in a quiet environment. Close to shopping and public transportation. Great breakfast and fast and realiable Internet. Last; very friedly staff.,4,2015,09,01
12,Great Hotel,"We stayed there for two nights mid- August, we had a great stay, spacious rooms, well lit and well furnished, all facilities available, iron, coffee and tea, good service. The best thing about this hotel was their beds, so comfy and soft, we were 2 adults and 2 children, we took a double bed room and each bed was big enough for two to sleep really comfortably.

The hotel is located in a nice quite area.",5,2015,09,01
12,Best hotel,"This hotel was amazing. I came here with my husband and 16 month daughter for 5 nights and the exprrience was wonderful.  
The staff are very polite and friendly and the hotel is only 30 minutes walk from la rambla. 
We stayed in a junior club suite which was wonderful and as we had a club room we had access to the club lounge. 
Again this was wonderful and we were able to use this on check out day also until it was time to catch our flight.  I would highly recommend and we will definitely be coming here again
",5,2015,08,31
12,Great hotel for business and tourists alike,"I stayed in the Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center in a Deluxe King Room near the end of August 2015. Having seen the pictures I expected this hotel to be very business oriented, as grey shades and brown tones dominate the decor. While this is certainly true, with meeting rooms available, free WiFi and a business center, I was positively surprised as a regular tourist as well. 

FRONT DESK & CHECK IN
I arrived early in the morning, knowing that check-in starts at 15:00. The front desk was very busy at the time and the staff somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of people there. I was somewhat surprised that there was what seemed to be a supervisor who went in and out of the reception area during this time, rather than helping. Without knowing what went on the reason for this is impossible to judge, of course, and may be completely valid.
It took about half an hour before I got to speak to a front desk operator, who tried very hard to smile throughout what was obviously a stressful time for her. I would have been able to check into a room with two beds immediately, which was a nice and surprising offer, but chose to just drop off the bags. 

Tip: there's no need to queue for check-in to do this, the luggage storage room is directly on the left of the main entrance. Simply come back later for the actual check in.

Around 15:00 the front desk was quiet again and I never encountered the same amount of people queuing again. Check-in was fast and friendly; the only noteworthy detail is that there was no description or information about any hotel amenities.

ROOM
The room on the 5th floor was much more spacious than expected. It was in a good state of repair and clean. The 55inch TV turned out to be a Smart TV, offering youtube and other streaming services built in. It was also mounted on a swivel, which was a nice touch to turn it towards the comfortable seating area, desk or the bed. 

The safe was a positive surprise. It was advertised as being able to store laptops, yet I had little hope as mine is a full fledged 17inch device. If fit barely through the door and once through there was ample space on the sides and top to store additional valuables. It would probably house a 19inch laptop if it weren't for the limited clearance at the door.

There is no paper bin at the desk, limiting options for disposal to the tiny bathroom bin.

Tip: there's a HDMI connection near the desk. While I didn't try it, this should allow you to easily mirror your laptop to the TV if you brought that cable.

Tip: I would advise against using the dedicated USB charging ports at the night stands and the desk as I experienced power issues the next day. Bringing your own charger (and adapter if needed) is a better option.

BATHROOM
The bathroom was large as well, with a full bathtub, an extra shower (which despite the label can't really be called a rain shower, it was a regular shower head with a ""rain"" setting. The water pressure was good and it offered a secondary movable shower head which easily made up for that), sink, and a toilet area with bidet behind another frosted glass door. The lack of a toilet brush is a not uncommon, but always a slightly annoying factor.

INTERNET
The internet connection turned out to be the only real let down in the hotel. While it was fast (a test stream of youtube videos at 1080p went flawlessly), it was also plagued by disconnects. During normal web browsing, a couple of reloads would fix that and video streaming usually buffered enough to not get interrupted, but due to the frequency of disconnects, there is no way this connection can be used for anything with demands for continuous connections (e.g. games). 

Wired internet was advertised and a connection was available at the desk, but there was no cable in the room. As I had forgotten mine, I inquired at the front desk where the staff was once againfriendly, but didn't know what type of cable this was, nor did they have any in the box of cables they showed me. 

Tip: bring a Ethernet cable if you plan to use a laptop.

HOUSE KEEPING
The room was clean on entering and after ever room service. Interestingly there was no consistency in how the room was prepared. On some days there would be extra linen at the sides of the beds, on others not. The coverlets were put in various places in the room, including near the window, on the chair, on the suitcase rest and on the bed. Maybe this lack of consistency is explained with me usually staying in the hotel quite late. It was not of relevance to my comfort in any case.

I stocked the mini bar with my own drinks, moving the drinks the hotel offered to the desk. Room Service left this arrangement alone and refilled the orange juice I drank in the mini bar.

The only letdown with housekeeping was that on one day, room service ignored my do not disturb sign, knocked and try to come in. I do expect this sign to be honored in a hotel of this level. 

Tip: use the chain for the door. 

SPA:
The Spa is run by Spazenter and makes good use of limited space. If you expect a swimming pool from the pictures, you will be disappointed; the size is simply too small. The water is also cooler than expected for a spa arrangement, which was obvious in the face of everyone entering for the first time. One does get used to the temperature though. 

Around the pool there are limited amount of opportunities to lie down, with some of them being heated stone. It also features 3 specialty showers - including a cold water bucket shower - as well as a caldarium, dry sauna and steam bath. There's a small cold pool for cooling down after these, as well as the aforementioned showers. A small stone walk with misty water sprayers rounds out the options outside the pool. 
In the pool there are some jets, with some being underwater and some from above. The in-water options for laying down are mounted too highly, which means you're usually not fully covered by water.

The Spa offers a variety of treatments, of which I tried a lomi lomi massage. The staff both at the front desk and in the massage area were friendly, but spoke close to no English, making communication difficult. The massage therapist didn't seem to excel at the pressure required for this type of treatment, but had a soft touch for the calmer applications.

TIP: if you plan to have a massage, go for a relaxing version. There's also the option to do this as partner treatments in a shared room.

PIANO BAR
The Piano Bar offers drinks at the bar and in the lounge area outside, which is very comfortable. The cocktails were good, the staff was friendly and helpful. 

RESTAURANT
I tried neither the breakfast nor room service nor the Restaurante EL Mall so I can't offer feedback on the food.

AIRPORT CONNECTION
Following the advice of a local I took the Aerobus. This bus connects the Plaza d'Espanya (the closest plaza) directly with the airport, making the transfer a matter of 15 minutes with no additional stops for a bit more than 5 Euros. The direction to the bus station is labeled outside the terminals and the bus leaves every 5 minutes. English was no issue here. Once exiting at the plaza, simply head towards the street with the two towers, towards Montjuïc. This is your first opportunity to enjoy the view of the castle and fountain. Once you reach the fountain, turn left and the hotel will be on the end of street on the right, making it a very pleasant 5-10 minute walk. 

When returning to the airport, the bus leaves from the bus station in front of the Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, again with no additional stops and every 5 minutes.
Alternatively there are taxis directly in front of the hotel.

LOCATION
The hotel is located near the expo center, making it ideal for business and expo visitors. It's also right next to the Montjuïc, offering great vistas, the castle, fountain, the Poble Espanyol where one can see different building styles of the various regions of Spain, and  behind the castle, the Olympia area. The hotel’s surrounding area feels safe. 

The main hub nearby is the Plaza d'Espanya, which offers the Arenas shopping center, access to two metro lines and a police station. I wouldn't suggest to eat right there as prices in this area tend to be higher without necessarily coinciding with better quality. Rather have a look for the smaller Tapas shops or restaurants a couple of street (or maybe a metro station or two) away. 

If you enjoy walking, going towards the Plaza Catalunya through some of the smaller streets is quite pleasant and let’s you discover some smaller sights and shops.

The location overall is more suitable for a city trip than a beach trip. Barcelonetta beach is about 40-45 minutes from the hotel both with metro or when walking. If you choose to go to this beach, I'd suggest using the metro from Poble Sec to Drassanes, which will bring you to Las Ramblas for a final walk passing the Mirador de Colom and the Yacht Harbor before hitting the beach. The walk is about 20 minutes. 

Tip: when returning via Metro, exit Plaza d'Espanya rather than Poble Sec. The distance is near identical. You will be a bit slower due to traffic lights, but you'll enjoy the sights along the way, something Poble Sec can't offer.

CONCLUSION
Service: English skills could be better, especially in the Spa area, but everyone is very friendly.
Location: Nice area with landmarks, relatively well connected with the exception of the beach.
Rooms: Spacious, clean, modern.

Overall: I enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend the hotel to anyone who is not looking for a daily beach trip (but do take one or two!).",5,2015,08,30
12,Close to Magic Fountain,"Arriving after an 8hr drive to find out they did not have our reservation in their system was deflating. But thanks to Maria and her front line staff they upheld our booking that we had made at the same price and upgraded us (as we are members) to the suite as we had been promised when we made the booking over the phone. As an added bonus we were given lounge access which just topped of everything.

Our suite had a separate lounge where our son slept, dining table and spacious bathroom with separate toilet. It was very clean and the beds comfortable. House keeping did a great job and freshen the rooms up at night.

The Club Lounge access was lovely as we could have a cup of tea or glass of bubbles any time of day. It also provided a good breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The staff were very helpful with any queries and as we had been travelling for 2 months we needed a laundry that was not expensive, they sorted this for us which was the best find.

This hotel is located close to all transport into city which is pretty easy to get to, even a cab was only $5 Euro. We hired scooters one day as its so easy to get around. It is in the Fira Center which is by the old Olympic area and Magic Fountain. Main shopping centre was the Bullring.

Thanks Maria for your professional service we intend to come back.",4,2015,08,30
12,Great City hotel!,"Very comfortable hotel in a great location ...close to all the restaurants ,sights etc. Staff very helpful in giving information and with great English ...rooms lovely and no problems with nighttime noise...good spot!",5,2015,08,28
12,Mixed Feelings,"I am having a hard time rating this hotel. Its not average, but its not very good either.
I stayed here with my husband for 3 nights. Carina at the front desk was very very nice and extremely helpful when we checked in. Customer Service is definitely her thing.

My husband is a Platinum member and we got upgraded to a very nice and spacious room. We were very happy about it. We were offered the upgrade to the Club Room for 20 euro per person, per night. We decided to try it for one day and here is where I have to say, we got very disappointed.

The buffet breakfast was ""ok"". Maybe as we have been in many IHG hotels around the world, we are spoiled with some breakfast buffets that are exceptionally good.They had a chef cooking eggs and omelettes and I requested a white egg omelette. This totally caught him off guard and told me he only had normal eggs. By the way, I speak spanish as first language....so its not that we were lost in translation. Finally he told me that he would ask the kitchen to make it and after 15 mins the omelette came..
Waiting service at breakfast not very helpful. Had to go and get my coffee twice. Never visited our table.

Now, the Club Room. First, I must say the concierges were extremely nice, helpful and professional. If you like to drink, this is a very good option and its worth it. But for us, non drinkers this was a total waste. We just wanted some Nespresso and snacks. But the snacks were cold and old Tapas. Fried and cold croquetas, in the morning and in the afternoon. I ended up drinking 2 glasses of Champagne to make it worth, as we didnt really like the breakfast and the Tapas either.

Next day, we asked one of the guys at the front desk for directions. I wont go in detail, but he totally failed in giving us the most important info. This was disappointing. The girls at the front desk were very helpful, the men not so much.

The location was good. The internet was very slow and unreliable in the rooms. The internet in the business center was a joke. Took FOREVER to load a page.

So this hotel is beautiful and in a nice location. But when it comes to service, they have a long way to go.

Not so sure if I would stay here again.",3,2015,08,28
12,"Perfect location, hotel, service.......","Upgraded to club level and spent a fabulous 5 days in Barcelona at the Crowne.  Front desk, around the clock, always with a smile and ready to assist.  Special thanks to Rafael and Mario, our club room agents, clearly client focused and very helpful in providing recommendations of where to go, how to get there, advance tickets/reservations, etc.... while also providing great service in the club room.   Room was spacious, spotless, bed fab and very quiet.   Location the best...... Mueseum and fountain display , Plaza Espayna, shopping, restaurants all within walking distance... close to metro as well.   My next Barcelona stay will definitely  be at the Crowne.",5,2015,08,27
12,great hotel but poor customer service,"We stayed in this hotel one one night before and after a cruise holiday.Overrall the hotel was clean, comfortable and well maintained with all the amenties you expect from a hotel of this rating. As we were a family of four staying in a room, we wanted some extra sachets of sugar and milk ( there were only 2 of each) for our morning tea. I rang reception and was told it will be delivered to the room. Twenty minutes later I rang again but the sugar and milk never came ! On the second morning, after our cruise, I rang housekeeping for some sugar and was told it will be brought to the room immediately. guess what, it never came...a bit annoying! poor customer service let this hotel down!",3,2015,08,27
12,Ideal Spot,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fira Center for 3 nights for a long weekend city break. The hotel is ideally situated for visiting all the sites. only 200m from the fountains at the Montjuic end of the city. Taxis are situated just outside the hotel, so it's easy to get around. Spa facilities are available in the hotel. A nice and relaxing bar area. The staff on check in were very helpful and are multi lingual. Even with us trying to check in with our very basic Spanish. Breakfast is the usual buffet type. Hot, cold and fruit. Fresh omelettes are cooked by the chef if required.Rooms are spacious with a huge tv. Would definitely return.",5,2015,08,22
12,Good hotel.,"Good hotel and location. Just round the corner from the metro and the Fira centre. Near Shops restaurants and site. Rooms are huge with good views and facilities. Choose this hotel if you'd prefer a quieter hotel away from the tourist places. 

Apart from the lovely lady with dark curly hair the hotel staff aren't to friendly and a little unwelcoming, however the rudeness is a general theme in Barcelona and it didn't affect my stay.

Ate In the restaurant a couple of times. Food was good and staff were more welcoming. 

Would stay again. 
",4,2015,08,22
12,"Spacious, comfortable, quiet, clean","Stayed here for 3 nights and would definitely be my first choice to stay upon return.  The room was very spacious, clean, quiet with comfortable beds and the staff very helpful and friendly.  We also had some very good meals at the restaurant and the breakfast buffet was probably one of the best I have seen.  This hotel is close (driving and walking) to many sites of interest.  I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.",5,2015,08,21
12,High style rooms and services in the center,"This hotel is also well known as one of the best choices for business travelers around the world. 

The classic high style rooms are well decorated with comfortable bed and luxurious furniture. 

It also has such an easy access to a number of traveller's hotspots in every way. ",5,2015,08,21
12,Perfect spot for family with young children.,"Clean modern hotel. Among the best if not the very best bathrooms we've encountered in Europe. Good access to all the sites, especially from the bank of waiting taxis at the front. Hotel restaurant was excellent - the service was superb, prices were reasonable.  Sushi and DJ nights were really relaxing.  Only glitch was checking in with the front desk - we had booked over the phone and had confirmation numbers - but they claimed that they only had our name ?!?!?  Then the person tried to upcharge from the rates that we had been quoted, and downsize one of our rooms (we had booked two rooms).  She just couldn't grasp the concept that we weren't willing to pay more for less.  She also wouldn't consider reducing one of the rates if we got two smaller rooms.  So in the end, we had to insist on getting what we were quoted on the phone. This process took over an hour.",5,2015,08,19
12,Can't say enough...wordless,"I would give it a badge of excellence ...with it's tremendous lofty marbled lobby..velvet couches , leather chairs ..overspreading across the lounges...
beyond any doubts a 5 star breakfast , apparently for example but not limited to four types of eggs ..boiled,scrambled ,omelet and sunny side up...room very spacious clean bright bed sheets ...shiny double shower bathroom...super fast free wifi ..fantastic gym and dimmed smoothly indulged sauna pool..great reception staff...great location in the middle of everywhere ..people would not stop coming to this hotel...family or couples ...it's a 5 stars hotel",5,2015,08,19
12,Not only for Fira guests,"We just came back from a romantic weekend in Barcelona and we're very happy we booked this hotel - out of the crowd in the city (yes, too many of us), close to beautiful Montjuic fountains and parks around, 10 min. walk to the airport bus and metro. So location is actually very good for visiting the city even if not walking distance to Ramblas. The hotel itself is in excellent shape, our room looked like brand new, relaxing SPA downstairs and people! Everyone at the reception was very friendly and helpful not to forget Marco from the bar, that makes a great job. We will surely come back if visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,08,18
12,Perfect - except for one mistake,"This is a great hotel with very good location, nice and spacey rooms, great bedroom, great breakfast and OK prices for Barcelona. What was terrible was arriving into a room cooled down to 15 degrees Celsius after a long day in Barcelona. Not sure if this was a mistake or a stupid standard but it was terribly cold, I had to wait an hour before the room temperature increased a bit so that I could go to bed without getting ill.",3,2015,08,17
12,Somewhat disappointing,"The good: Room size was excellent by European standards for the price. Proximity to Magic Fountain and Montjuic. 

The bad: Hotel entrance blocked round the clock by smoking taxi drivers. Poor service - my room was plagued with sewerage smell from the toilet and all that the reception offered was to send a cleaner to spray the toilet with a pungent aerosol. Beds were overly soft. 

Location was average. Its a fair 10-15min walk to the nearest metro. Limited dining options even at Placa d'Espanya. Didn't feel 100% safe walking with my girlfriend from metro back to hotel at night. ",2,2015,08,17
12,Modern and clean hotel with good location,The hotel has good location and it is very clean and modern. Rooms are well equipped and big. The reception gave us excellent service no matter what was the question. The only thing we had trouble with was the houskeeping. Towells were missing and not enough glasses were left etc. Thanks to the reception staff everything got fixed...,4,2015,08,16
12,Clean hotel but other areas mediocre,"I recently stayed at this hotel in Barcelona for a weekend getaway. The location is good being within walking distance to the National Art Gallery, shopping mall and and good restaurants. It was clean and the room was a good size. However, some of the other things about the hotel were not what I had hoped for. I ordered room service the first night and waited an hour only to find out they had the wrong room number. When they finally brought the meal it was cold. 
We ate breakfast one day at the breakfast buffet and waited 10 minutes to order an omelette but was never acknowledged so just left. 
I also asked at the front desk to get some coffee pods for the machine in my room but they never delivered any. 
We went to the pool one day only to find out their is a charge to use it. I would have expected that some basics about the hotel would have been covered during check in. But the check in was very basic. We also never got any welcome drink or other items which are supposedly part of the Expedia VIP program. 
Every time we came to the lobby it was a long wait to get assistance. While the staff was professional in general, the service overall was not at the level I would expect. 
Overall a nice facility but needs some improvements.",3,2015,08,16
12,Nice place to stay,"We booked in here at very short notice having been let down by another hotel as we arrived in Barcelona.

On arrival was met by a very pleasant and helpful staff who quickly changed our room due to noisy maintenance duct outside.

The second room was on the first floor and looked out to the street but the noise was minimal.

The room was very clean and tidy and well maintained and cleaned each day.

This brightened our day as there was 2 of us yet we only got 1 complimentary bottle of water. Some days we got one tea bag or milk there was a nesspresso coffee machine and only got capsules one day as we had been left no coffee. 

The towels was even better some days they were changed some days not we had the complete differing combination of towels throughout our stay.
 I appreciate when we asked reception things were rectified immediately. We just found it a laugh trying to guess which combination of the coffee tea and towels we would be left with.

The hotel is 2 mins walk from the magic fountain but fare walk from the main centre or taxi cost between 5-7 euros to the marina area dependant of time of day and taxis wait directly outside.

We have stayed in crowne plaza hotels in London and this was as good always clean and tidy and staff very helpful nice place enjoyed our stay, apart from the little attention to detail.",4,2015,08,16
12,A lovely hotel for a visit to Barcelona.,"We booked this hotel for a 6 night stay while we visited the city of Barcelona. We upgraded to the Club Room and we were not disappointed. 
On arrival we were escorted to the Club Lounge for check in. Our cases were taken to our rooms while we relaxed with one of the many drinks available from their hot and cold selection. Tasty tapas was also available, which was very nice as we arrived at lunchtime, straight from the airport. I absolutely loved the mushroom croquettes.
Our room was quite big with a separate living area, lovely bedroom & its own little balcony. Unfortunately we didn't get to use it much due to our being out most of the day. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. We also had a large bathroom with separate bath and shower, which was very useful. Dressing gown, slippers, nice toiletries, etc.
We used the Club Lounge every morning for breakfast and most evenings after a busy day touring. We really enjoyed having the snacks & drinks, and the use of the very helpful Concierge's for any bookings or information. They were very helpful and friendly. Many thanks to Rafael and Rafe. You were wonderful!
Our daughters were most impressed that there were always two bottles of Moet & Chandon on ice, ready and available for patrons. My husband loved the bottles of San Miguel, while I preferred the fruit juices and assorted teas.
We did have a little problem with the towels, and coffee & tea in our room not being replenished once or twice. A quick phone call to reception quickly got that sorted. Just a shame it happened to what was almost a perfect stay.
We bought a ten journey ticket for the metro, the best way to get around we thought. Very easy to use, regular and fast. It's about a 10 minute stroll  to the metro at  Espanya where you have a large number of connections to other lines. We also used the station Poble Sec on L2. A similar distance but with less options. We used one 10 trip ticket at a time as multiple people can use it. Just make sure you put the ticket through for each person making the journey! 100 euro fine for no ticket. (Machines are like in London.) Easy to buy at the metro station, with English information. 10 euros for 10 trips.
This hotel is situated near the musical fountain & Olympic stadium. You will need to get the metro to La Rambla, Columbus Column, Gaudi's houses, Gothic quarter, etc. unless you like long walks. We didn't find it getting around a problem, being reasonably fit in our 54th year. We got the metro & walked. I wouldn't have chosen this hotel if I had mobility problems though.
Breakfast was very nice with quite a selection on offer. I ordered a mushroom omelette one day that was absolutely delicious and only took 15 minutes to arrive. 
Would we stay here again? Yes, definitely, and we'd make sure we had access to the Club Lounge. It saved us a fortune in the evenings on drinks! The upgrade paid for itself, and I didn't touch the champagne!",4,2015,08,11
12,Great location and high quality accommodation,"Very enjoyable stay in this hotel - rooms are very spacious with nice contemporary decor, furniture and fittings. Large comfortable beds and large TVs. Complementary coffee from machine in room, also in-room fridge is useful and there is complementary mineral water. Good breakfast buffet. Facilities are good including free wi-fi and a room of Apple computers for guests to use on ground floor. Checkout was a bit slow as the hotel was busy but otherwise front desk was very helpful. Location is great, especially for the attractions of Montjuic and environs. The attached restaurant is also good and you can get a good discount on dinner from thefork.com. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,08,10
12,"Great Location, Nice Hotel","This is a nice hotel!  The double beds seemed a little small, but the rooms are large and well appointed.  (We should have asked for the king-sized bed.)  The hotel is 2 blocks from the Magic Fountain, an art museum, and 3 blocks from the metro and the old bull-fighting ring which has many good restaurants on its top floor.",5,2015,08,06
12,Great hotel and very good service,"Great hotel, service was very good and location was decent.  I had lounge access and the people in the lounge were very helpful, Marcal, Mario and Rafa were all wonderful.  I just wish that the lounge had better options for snacks, the breakfast was only available till 10 am and that is not good since it is summer and people on vacation should not be expected to wake up and get there so early.  I paid a lot of money for this but could not really use it.  In the afternoon they put out left overs.  I would not recommend getting the lounge access here, its not worth it.",4,2015,08,06
12,Best hotel in Barcelona,"We booked the Crowne plaza for a family holiday and it exceeded our expectations. we stayed in club room which were very well equipped, clean and functional. The club lounge staff especially Mario who was very polite and extremely helpful. He made our stay very pleasurable. The breakfast was excellent, great choice of food and tasted amazing. We definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,08,06
12,Short stay but fantastic hotel,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Barcelona for one night while visiting friends. After a 5 hour drive from elsewhere in Spain the spacious, air conditioned room was a welcome sight. The bed was comfortable and huge. The room also contained a couple of comfy chairs and a Nespresso coffee machine with a few complimentary coffee pods. The rest of the hotel seems very open and well decorated, and the whole building appears to be air conditioned. We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was tasty but nothing special.

The location is great but that may depend on what you're doing in Barcelona. It's very close to a major convention centre so if you're there on business or for a conference it's probably perfectly situated. It's also only a 5 minute walk away from a couple of different Metro stations which make it easy to travel anywhere in the city. If you're driving into Barcelona the private car park directly under the hotel is incredibly useful as parking is at a premium all over the city.

All of the staff members I spoke to were incredibly friendly and helpful. I had no problems in changing larger-denomination Euro notes at the check-in desk to get some change for the Metro. All in all, an excellent hotel and highly recommended.",5,2015,08,05
12,Wonderful Hotel - Great Location,"We booked a room at the last minute and were given excellent service from the reception staff while checking in. Our room was spacious and had all the amenities needed. Although the hotel is not situated in the heart of Barcelona, the location was perfect. The neighborhood is filled with a range of restaurants, two nearby Metro stops and we felt comfortable being out at all hours. The Metro ride into the heart of Barcelona was about ten minutes. 

We spent seven days with them and were very happy about our choice. One small dip in service was our morning breakfast brought to the room on three occasions. Twice the order was slightly off and the meals were warm but not hot. 

When we return to Barcelona, this will definitely be the spot we stay.",4,2015,08,05
12,"Comfortable Hotel, Good Location","Stayed in the hotel with my partner on my business trip to Barcelona for Four days in July 15. The hotel is behind the Fira Center and taxi drivers know the hotel as Fira Palace which was its earlier name. The hotel is around 200 m from Palace de Mountjuic which has beautiful fountains in front of it. One Saturday and Sunday, the whole area is illuminated with light and there is light and sound show on the main fountain which one must watch. Barcelona is small city and cheaper than other major cities in Europe. The language is a little problem. English is not understood primarily.

The hotel is quite spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. The rooms are spacious and very quite. I chose club room on 3rd floor. The room AC is so quite that one has to check whether it is working. The control signs of AC are little confusing. The toilet is very clean and has good quality toiletries.

There is good variety available in breakfast with live egg counter.",5,2015,08,02
12,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights, lovely clean spacious rooms. staff extremely friendly on reception. Moët bar lovely, barman was excellent in offering selection of drinks available. only few niggles having to pay for nespresso capsules and £12.50 to use swimming pool.  Area is away from  Ramblas, takes about 45 minutes by foot, but £5 by taxi, right by magic fountain ( which is a must to see in evenings). Overall you won't be disappointed. Was here with family to celebrate our Anniversary was a lovely place to visit, would definitely recommend.",5,2015,08,01
12,Perfect city break,Stayed here for five nights. Complementary birthday cake for our daughter was lovely and greatly appreciated. Rooms clean and staff very helpful. Breakfast is varied and plentiful and location ideal for bus/metro and magic fountain. Recommend as ideal place to stay for a city break.,4,2015,08,01
12,"Excellent location, good service, large rooms with contemporary furnishings","This hotel is next to the Magic Fountain with a taxi stand right outside and the two metro stops are 5-10 minutes away.  A taxi ride from the airport should cost less than 30 Euros.   The rooms we reserved had two very comfortable queen size beds.  We checked in a little after 9pm and it took a while to process but we got the room that we asked for, the hotel seemed full and busy at the time.  The bathroom had separate shower area, toilet area and bath tub/sink area; all were separated by doors.  The room furnishings were nice and came with a lounge chair and a 55in TV.  There were many restaurants near the hotel and the Magic Fountain was a 5-minute walk away.  Why it didn't get 5 star?  The sink had some drainage problem.  We will stay here again if visit Barcelona again.",4,2015,07,31
12,Great hotel. ,"We stayed here in late July for 3 nights.  We had 2 rooms for our family of 6.  Though not connecting, the rooms were of excellent size, clean and bathrooms were very good.  There were a lot of modern amenities in the room including the USB ports in the wall, YouTube on the TV, etc.  

The morning breakfast was very hectic, but made to order omlettes  along with the usual fruits, bread and dairy products were fresh and tasty.  

The location is a quick walk from the major fountains.  There isn't much to eat around the hotel, besides the hotel restaurants.  Location wise it's about 3/4 of a like from the nearest metro, plaza espana.  It's a great station with connections to almost all lines, so that was convenient.  

I general a great place to stay with good size rooms, breakfast and decent location.  We would go back. ",5,2015,07,27
12,"Nice stay, good service","Excellent hotel, excellent customer service.
The breakfast is good, the lounge access is decent but it closes at 11 pm.....I would request the hotel management to keep it open at least till 12 midnight.
",5,2015,07,23
12,"Modern, Clean and Spacious!  Nice Hotel!","Stayed here before and after a cruise.  The hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood.  10 to 15 minutes walk to the nearest metro.  Within walking distance to Montjüic's Magic Fountain, The National art museum of Catalunya and Spanish Village.  
The first impression of the hotel was good.  The lobby was clean and spacious.  There was a lobby bar, a restaurant and a business centre on the same level.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The room was spacious, clean, and modern, and well furnished.  Beds were super comfortable. Air conditioning and free wifi were all working perfectly.  Bathroom was bright and clean with desirable amenities.  Everything was in perfect condition.   We got access to the Club Lounge which included breakfast and evening tapas.  The Club Lounge was a nice cozy place to relax. There were good variety of drinks available through out the day, including choice of tea, coffee, juice, spirits etc.  The breakfast spread in the morning was appealing with both hot and cold dishes.  Unfortunately, the evening tapas which they boasted about were a little disappointing, which was limited in both selection and quantities.  People went for tapas in the early evening were disappointed to find that there were nothing left and nothing were being replenished.  
The food in the restaurant L’Aria was quite good.  Surprisingly the price was quite reasonable with the 15 percent discount coupon they offered us at check-in, and the service was excellent.

After all, it was a pleasant stay!",4,2015,07,21
12,Brilliant weekend stay here,"I stayed here as part of a large group and I was booked into a room with my Husband. 
My first impressions of the Hotel were good, the reception area was nice & the staff were helpful and friendly. Check in was quick and straight forward and there was no issues checking out. 

Our room was on the 3rd floor and the hall way window had a fab few of Barcelona, it looked really nice when the sun was setting. The room was spacious and the double bed was comfortable and big. The room had a relaxing area with chairs and coffee machine and kettle. There was also a large TV in the room. The Bathroom was split into different sections and again it was spacious. There was a bath and separate shower facilities. 

We spent time in the hotel bar which was a relaxing area and the service was good. The price of drinks at the bar was expensive but was to be expected. 

We had breakfast and there was lots to chose from. The breakfast area was small but clean and helpful waiting staff. 

Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to try out the hotels leisure and spa facilities. 

Location wise this hotel really ticked all the boxes for us. It is a five minute walk to the Water Fountains and certain nights from 8pm there is a water fountain display which is really nice to see. It also gathers a big crowd for this. At the top of the stairs the Catalonia Museum is situated and gives a really great view of Barcelona. 

A further 10-15 minute walk and you are at the Areana which is a big shopping centre with restaurants at the top of it. I would really suggested visiting this as you get a lovely view and a great choice of restaurants. 

Again, 10-15 minute walk from the hotel at the same area as Areana you can get the  Barcelona Tour bus and the Metro station which is only one stop to Las Rambles. 

Only issue was the wifi was down that weekend which wasn't ideal but not a huge issue and didn't effect our stay. 

Overall we had a great stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona. It was a clean and presentable hotel and was in a great location. If visit Barcelona again I will definitely be booking the Crowne Plaza.",5,2015,07,14
12,Far from four stars.,"There's a reason for why this hotel was still available when we did our booking when 89% of the city hotels were fully booked. The service, especially house keeping, was inconsistent and terrible. 
- Every night we had to call them for face towels, which they took away in the morning but never replaced. 
- My parents room smelt a bit moldy and one night they had a big insect that looked like a tic on their bed. My dad crushed it on the pillow in panic and left the spot visible for housekeeping to change the pillowcase the day after but instead they just turned the pillow over and put it back on their bed with the mashed spot still on it, nasty!
- They refilled the coffee and biscuits everyday in one of the rooms but not in the other. 
- Breakfast is not even close to fit a four star hotel. I've stayed at a number of four and five star hotels and this was quite disappointing.
I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2015,07,12
12,great hotel. Good service,everything was good. Got club level included with our room which made it even better. rooms very clean. Everything in working order. All the staff was great. Very friendly. Upper floors are probably better. Very near laser light show.,5,2015,07,12
12,Excellent,"I got the chance to stay in Fira last August, the prices were still low back then and everything was excellent, the rooms are spacious  and very clean, the beds are really comfy, not far from the center. Too bad it´s too expensive now!",5,2015,07,12
12,Lovely hotel and very friendly staff,We had a family room which was very nice. Great location very near Mont Juc and Place Espanya. Would recommend. If you don't want today hotel breakfast prices then plenty of local cafes. Staff are very friendly and helpful,4,2015,07,08
12,Perfect hotel for a business event,"The Crowne Plaza Barcelona has certainly been one of the best hotels I have stayed in so far. Rooms are spacious and clean, with silent air conditioning which doesn't blow you out of bed at night. Curtains fully block incoming light and the best thing by far is how quiet the rooms are. 

Room is well equipped: StressLess relax chair, comfortabel double bed, large format tv; and the bathroom has a bath, double sink, and separate cabins with a toilet/bidet and shower. 

From a tourist perspective the only disadvantage of the hotel is that it is somewhat remote to the city center. The subway stop, however, isn't all that far away.

The hotel is on walkings distance from the Fira complex, the National Catalonian Art Museum, the Magical fountains (Thursday - Sunday at 09:00 pm) and the former bull arena Placa de les Arenes.",5,2015,07,07
12,Nice stay- helpful staff,A very nice stay not too far from the metro station or the hub of the city center. The staff are very friendly - Big thank you to Judith at reception. The rooms are spacious and there is a nice touch with the complimentary tray. Bed is very comfortable. Breakfast was a bit of a let down I thought but overall I enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay again.,4,2015,07,07
12,Good hotel a little out from city center,"Nice hotel friendly greeting upon arival. Within walking distance of a mall with the top floor floor of restaurants.  Worth checking out. The stayed in a club suite very nice two tvs, sofa separate bedroom, desk and conference table. The club longue is nice but for the price of the room I would expect cooked to order omelets they didn't have. Right down the road you,csn get the hop on and off bus and metro. Also a quick walk is the,water fountain show. Nice hotel quite location I would stay here again",5,2015,07,06
12,Great hotel. Value for money,"The Crowne plaza located at Fira Center, Barcelona is a good hotel with a great location. 

The staff is very friendly, the rooms are big and well equipped and the food at the restaurant is very good. 

It is at walking distance from the Metro station and other tourist attractions near by. The taxi from the airport charges approximately 20 Euros. 

All in all its a good place to stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend it to tourist coming to Barcelona for 3/4 day trips. 

A big thumbsup to the reception and restaurant staff",5,2015,07,05
12,Great location and staff,First trip to Barcelona and enjoyed every minute.  Front staff was very welcoming and any question we asked they were extremely helpful.  Great location on a quiet street.  Taxi's always outside and didn't really go anywhere that was overr 7-10 euros.  The rooms were large and great bathroom separate from the room was nice when traveling with family.,5,2015,07,01
12,Really Nice Hotel,"We recently stayed in the Crowne Plaza hotel for a week using reward points and it was really first rate. Check in was quick, efficient and all details were correct and as a platinum elite member an excellent breakfast combined with club lounge access was offered  at check in which proved to be extremely convenient. 

Our room was really nice and well furnished with good bathroom facilities. The bed was very comfortable and sleeping was not disrupted. Room maintenance was regular and efficient with only a nominal disruption should we be in the room at the time. Free wifi was available in the room.

The buffet breakfast offered was of high standard with a good range of dishes available both hot and cold together with fruit juices, coffee or tea and pastries. Taking breakfast in the club lounge was extremely convenient as were the range of tapas offered in the lounge during the evening. The dinner restaurant has  a menu with a good range of choices at reasonable prices, the food was very nice and the service efficient and friendly.

The hotel is very conveniently located within walking distance of many of the desirable features of the city and access to the many tour buses is only minutes away. 

We would not hesitate to stay again should we revisit Barcelona",4,2015,07,01
12,Fantastic if you want to stay a cab ride from the beach,"This is a really nice place. The staff are great the spa is fantastic and if you want to be able to relax away from the party district at the end of the night than this is a fantastic place to stay.
It is a little bit dry around the area it is a five minute cab ride to the beach. However, there are some good Catalonian restaurants near by the hotel. I would definitely come back hear but if you want a party holiday you might want to stay nearer the beach.",4,2015,07,01
12,Excellent Hotel,"Situated a few minutes walk from Espanya Plaza and all that has to offer. Metro station, 3 / 4 stops to either end of Las Ramblas, night fountains, shopping area and plenty restaurant, bar facilities, tour bus stop etc.. On a 2 day break you wouldn't need to leave this area.
As for hotel itself, very well maintained Crown Plaza, attentive and efficient staff in all areas. Room was spacious with good furnishings. Very good spa facility with treatments at a reasonable cost.
Numerous transport options within 100m for getting around Barcelona and to and from airport. 
Highly recommended.",5,2015,06,30
12,Nice hotel,"Not really close to much.  Had to take a cab every where.  Stayed in club level.  Ok breakfast and snacks/drinks included.  I had thought they might have good help at the club level with excursions but no such luck.
Nice room with king bed, shower ok.  Maid service ok.",3,2015,06,28
12,Wonderful hotel!,"The hotel is located near Plaza Espana, on a quite street. 

The rooms are large and modern. On the ground floor is a nice piano bar.  Staff is helpful. 5 star breakfast. 

Overall a great place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,27
12,Wonderful hotel!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel, we went on leisure and although this is not a city centre hotel, it was really easy to get to and from Las Ramblas and the port/beach either by taxi (about 7 euros each way) or by the near by metro (Playa Espana, about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel!)
The hotel is super clean and the staff are so friendly. We were on the 6th floor in an executive room and the room was so spacious and tidy. Bed was super comfy with all the amenities you'd expect.
Word of advise... On the air con control, the snowman symbol actually means the heat button, not the air con! We couldn't work out why the room was so hot, until we realised that!!

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and lots to choose from and it was good quality food.

All in all, a wonderful stay and a great choice of hotel in more of the less touristy side, but still accessible!! Also, taxis are waiting outside the hotel all day long, so really easy to go by taxi, just a quick 5 minute drive into las ramblas!!",5,2015,06,25
12,Nice hotel and location,"The staff was outstanding at this property.  Everyone went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant, especially the front dest personnel.  The rooms were nicely appointed, clean, modern and bright. Breakfast was generous. The location just a couple of blocks from the Parc de Montjuic (beautiful light and fountain display in the evenings), National Museum of Art of Catalunya and easy access to the metro and train, was a plus.",4,2015,06,24
12,"Great hotel, highly recommended","I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my family and the whole experience was very pleasant. We had booked a triple room which was very spacious, with 2 queen size beds and one sofa bed. The room, just like rest of the hotel, was tastefully decorated with nice paintings. The staff at the reception, restaurant, room service, instant service was very efficient and our requests were attended to immediately. The food at the restaurant and the morning breakfast was very good too. Wifi was free, with no limit on devices being used. 

After we checked out, I got robbed of my wallet at a Metro station. When we came to collect our bags, the staff at reception allowed me to make international calls to cancel my credit cards, for which I'm grateful to them. 

Overall, a great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,06,21
12,BEST hotel experience in recent memory!,"If you are in Barcelona - this should be the only hotel choice for you. The hotel is spotless, in a great area and if you're asked if you would like to upgrade to a suite for a few euros more (in our case, 60 EUR), JUMP at the opportunity. The suite was huge with a table for 6, great pull out couch, huge desk, terrific reclining chair, big bedroom and large bathroom - oh and two GIANT TV's and free wifi. But that's not all - the suite comes with lounge club entry. They put other hotels to shame with the abundance of offerings throughout the day. Not only are wines, spirits, sodas, juices and waters offered round the clock, the food is exceptional. You could easily skip meals out. The breakfast was uncanny. There were so many selections. I would never choose another hotel if I go back. There is no competition.",5,2015,06,19
12,"Great hotel, good location","Enjoyed our stay. Rooms & bathroom very updated, modern & clean.  Bed was extremely comfortable, and rooms are quite large with mini bar, iron, etc. Loved the hotel Restaurant too....food was excellent!  Our only complaint was a little mixup with room service, but otherwise all good.",5,2015,06,16
12,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Great hotel fairly well placed in Barcelona. Close to the Arena (the old Bull Ring, now a shopping and entertainment centre). The staff are very friendly and helpful. We had access to the Club Lounge which is one of the best I have been in. The breakfast was excellent with hot offerings as well as the normal Continental options, Nice lively bar but not necessary for us as the Lounge has a fully stocked bar and hot drinks available all day. Tapas are also served early evening. Room was a good size and well equipped",5,2015,06,15
12,A surprisingly nice hotel,"This is in the upcoming area of Poble Sec, which now has many classy restaurants but is most enjoyable because it is the real Barcelona, away from the tourist hordes. I cannot emphasize what a great find this is. Ok it is a convention hotel but it is much homier than even a boutique spot. The staff are wonderful. It is near to fabulous Monjuic, Plaza Espagna, and of course the charming areas of Poble Sec and San Antoni. Rooms are deluxe with all the modern comforts. It surpasses in my view even the better known chains.",5,2015,06,14
12,A great place in the center of the action,"We visited The Crown Plaza as a part of our Barcelona portion of our European trip by Vantage Tours.  There were 29 on this leg and had just flown in from Lisbon on a 48 passenger TAP jet.  The rooms were ready when we arrived and we found them to be quite spacious as well as well appointed and clean. There was a large bath with separate shower and tub.... both spacious. The room was well decorated and bright with a 50"" flat screen TV. The bed was quite large and very comfortable. There was a long desk area and a huge closet. There was a complimentary coffee/tea service on the desk . I also enjoyed the use of the very comfortable ""stressless"" style chair in the room.  Our tour had arranged for a snack service for us on the ""A"" floor where they had a very nice ""Club"" setup for guests that has light foods and drinks available along with a TV and many nice seating areas. We used this club several times. 

I arrived with a cold so we enjoyed room service that evening... it was prompt and not too pricy over the standard restaurant offerings. Janice had broiled fish dinner for 23.5 E and I just had a very lean hamburger and fries for 13 E . TV was limited with no CNN or our preferred FOX news stations so there was little news available . We were also there while the finals for the Spanish Football ( soccer) were being held not far from the hotel and there were 92,000 sports fans in the stands as well as about 20,000 in the palace grounds about 2 blocks from the hotel at the Magic Fountain area near the Palace .....the town was loud and lively for sure! 

While somewhat removed from the center of town, there is easy access via a good transit system and there is a fast turnover of cabs at the front of the hotel.  We also discovered a great Tapas Bar about 2 blocks away. There are restaurants within the hotel and we had a great breakfast buffest there each morning. Our closing dinner was also held at the hotel and was nicely served and quite tasty as well. When we return to Barcelona, I would not hesitate to use this hotel again.",4,2015,06,11
12,Very Nice Quiet Room Near Catalonia Square,"This is our first stay here and we were very impressed. We stayed in a ""Club Suite"". It had a separate king bedroom and a separated living room and dining/work desk table.

We really loved our stay here. Close to Catalonia Square, the Magic Waters, and Spanish Village. Would stay hear again in a heart beat. We booked on Hotel.com and got a pretty good rate considering the room size, club lounge and large king bed for the price. We stayed in a corner room, #302.

Our package included breakfast at the Club Lounge and high speed internet. 

You couldn't ask to much more in a room. For us, the king size bed is always a huge plus when traveling (which is rare to find in Europe). It has a couch fold out sofa bed and a comfy leather sitting chair with foot rest. It also had a large over-size modern bathroom with large vanity mirror with attached lighted make-up mirror, separated defused glass enclosed toilet, bidet, and full size tub with hand sprayer. It also has a two person size separated defused glass enclosed shower with over head tall sprayer as well as a separate hand wand sprayer.

The breakfast lounge breakfast was a nice size area and had a variety of breads, cheeses, cereals, cut fruits, plus cooked eggs, bacon, sausage and potatoes. They also had some gourett wrapped muffins that were very yummy. Coffee, wine, champagne, water and milk were all provided. Scrambled eggs were warm (not hot). I like to see hard boiled eggs at buffets, but missing here. No omelet station. Over-all, i would rate it a 7/10.

The Club lounge offers during the day tapas (snack treats) wine, beer, bottle water, juices, sodas and some finger foods and no cost. A Concierge is always available when the lounge is open to answer questions, book reservations, highlight maps, make suggestions, etc. They were all helpful during our stay.

One thing I really liked was how quite the room was considering it is on a busy street. Upon looking closer at the patio sliging door I could see why. The patio had two sets of doors as dis the windows for blocking out most of the sound. Very nice appreciate touch.

WARING FOR BARCELONA:  Pick-pockets are everwhere and are very good. They also are very clever in honing in on unsuspecting tourists and their loose packages, backpacks, cameras, iPods, etc. Be warned and keep EVERYTHING tightly watched and snapped closed at all times!

Why tell you this. THEY GOT ME! I would have included photos here with my review, but my Canon camera was stolen in a KFC while taking a lunch break of a hop-on, hop-off bus tour. I am sooo very careful about my stuff, especially my camera while traveling, but these guys/gals were VERY crafty. We were eating at a high table and I was sitting on the straps of my shoulder bag which had my camera inside. Dummy me, I left the camera straps dangle outside and forget to snap the front clip. The thief was able to access my bag by crawling under the table behind us and slip the camera out. 

A woman then said something to my wife seated next to me in Spanish about someone taking your camera. When I looked at the bag, it was gone. I asked who and she pointed to the door, but no one could be seen with my camera. I think her and her companion pulled off the heist and she was the distraction. BE WARNED, it happens to the best. These guys are PROs and will steal at the first opportunity!",5,2015,06,10
12,Love this hotel!,"I can't say enough about this wonderful hotel.  Even though it is not in the very center of town, it is a 5 minute walk to the metro station, where you can go all over town.  Very close to the Magic Fountain and Plaza Espanya.
Beautifully appointed rooms, quite large by European standards.  Free coffee and water in the room.  Free wifi. Very clean.  Service was top notch.  Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices for hot and cold items.  I highly recommend this hotel if you don't want to be in a noisy downtown area.",5,2015,06,07
12,Wonderful hotel.,"We stayed here for 4 nights to end our adventure in Spain.  The hotel is located away from the major sights of Barcelona, but it is very close to the Magic Fountain, Plaza Espanya and Montujic Castle.  A quick 7 minute walk takes you to the metro station which gets you to the heart of the city in just a few minutes.  Our room was large, very well appointed with comfortable bedding and pillows.  We slept like babies.  The bathroom is also large with a separate tub, shower and toilet area.  There was a coffee maker and a kettle in the room which was an added touch.  However, the coffee mugs did not fit under the spout of the coffee maker.  No big deal though.  Every staff member we spoke with was polite and courteous.  We loved having the business centre to check in for our flight home and printing our boarding passes.  I have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2015,06,02
12,Great Rooms ! Value for Money ! ,"Even though this hotel is a bit far from city centre, the quality of rooms at the price offered makes up for the distance. We like to walk a bit so the trek from the hotel to the nearest metro stop (10 min) was enjoyable for us. It was wonderful to come back to a luxury room after a full day of sightseeing and shopping. The breakfast was great as well. We had a small issue while checking in as there was only one a attendant and we had to wait for almost 20 min. However she made up with offering us free drinks at the bar and an upgrade ! ",5,2015,05,31
12,Great Hotel ! Modern and Classy,"Stayed at this Crowne Plaza for our vacation  to Barcelona. Service was great . Front desk was very helpful and always answered my questions with so much information. room was modern with great amenities . Modern bathroom . Turndown service with cute little sheep cookies was my favourite personal touch ,Close to subway stops and was able to get a good nights sleep in the luxurious comfy bed . Will certainly return on my next visit to the city ",5,2015,05,28
12,Excellent hotel and service,"Excellent hotel with luxurious service and furnishings. Large room and bath. First class amenities and service. Convenient with good services within walking distance, although not walking distance to visitor sites. Metro is a few blocks away which is convenient.",5,2015,05,28
12,Almost. . . 5 stars,"This hotel is located perfectly and the price was reasonable for the time we stayed. The metro and train stations are super close. We like to walk but when we got tired we jumped on the metro. Also it is close to the Olympic Center, Jardins de la Maternitat, Magic Water Fountain and National Art Museum of Catalunya. We were given a quiet room on the 6th floor. There was not much of a view but the room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was huge! There was a separate bath and shower. And the toilet had its own door. The toiletries were wonderful too.The pillows where body pillows and a bit uncomfortable but we asked for regular pillows. The only thing that made our stay 4 stars is ""almost"" every day we had to ask for an extra towel set - as there was three of us and they put towels for two.  Free WiFi was reliable and good.",4,2015,05,27
12,European Vacation ,"This hotel is near to everything. It is next door to the National Meusem and the Congress Center. The hotel is ultra modern, very clean and with great service. There is plenty of parking. Love the place.",5,2015,05,27
12,Great hotel,"This hotel was great. All the amenities, huge room exceptional little touches like the aromatics and counting sleep cookies if you have trouble adjusting from the time change.  The staff were exceptional and highly responsive. The location is very convenient-not right in the heart of the Rambla but two blocks from Placa D'Espanya subway so easy access to everything. ",5,2015,05,27
12,"High Standard, great business hotel",Stayed for 2 nights on a work trip. Really great room - 2 comfy double beds.  Awesome 50 inch TV and all facilities you would expect.  Nice touches like high standard bath foam etc were welcome touches.  Staff were really helpful and the standard of English was excellent.  A really nice touch here was the hotel were keen to promote running and provided dedicated running maps along with complimentary towels by reception for when you returned along with bottled water and fruit.  The location is great for the Olympic Village and the Art Museum - just a 5 minute walk away.  I walked to La Rambla which was about 30 minutes walk and the beach about 40 mins.,4,2015,05,26
12,Good for a weekend break,Rooms a good size and clean. Hotel very busy - long wait to check in. Didn't help that they had lost our reservation - an embarrassingly long queue built up while they tried to sort it out. Breakfast very crowded at 9.30 - not enough staff to keep the buffet replenished in a timely manner. Breakfast 16 euros - expensive if not included in the room rate. We enjoyed our stay despite the negative points. The hotel is well situated near to a metro station and the nearby fountains are spectacular at night.,4,2015,05,26
12,The beds are Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona for 8 nights and were overall happy with our experience.  The area is quiet but 10 mins walk to the Spanish Square and the Magic Fountain.  It's probably better for business that for a holiday but it was clean, comfortable and the staff were helpful.  The beds are the best of any hotel I've stayed at in a long time!!",4,2015,05,26
12,Five Stars for 4 Star price,"Just checked in tonight for overnight stay after a 10 jaunt in the region. Such an easy check in. Hotel is great. Rooms is very big, bathroom is x large too. Bed is perfect. Room setvuce , best burger and fries and fast too. We have been in a several hotels over the past 10 days and this one caps off the trip on a high note. W e willget a good nit sleep before the lo. Haul back to the USA. Thank you for a good value and good nit sleep... We will return when we are in BaceLeona again...
",5,2015,05,24
12,Great hotel to stay on business,"I stayed for one night at the Crowne Plaza on a business trip. It's about a 10-minute walk from Pl. Espanya and approx. 25 minutes from the airport by bus. It is a well-equipped hotel with large rooms / beds and fully kitted out bathrooms with a separate shower and bath. My bed was large and comfortable and the room itself was very quiet. I slept very well, in fact.  In the morning, I used the gym and although it's small, it was kitted out with all the regular cardio machines, so there was plenty to keep me busy. I also recommend the restaurant which is fine dining and serves an interesting menu of regionally influenced dishes. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend to anyone looking for a business hotel in central Barcelona.",5,2015,05,24
12,Excellent weekend stay,"We stayed at this property for the F1 Grand Prix weekend. The staff were fantastic, the hotel and room were excellent and the club lounge was perhaps the best we have experienced. On arrival we were escorted to the dedicated club check-in and offered a drink. The club lounge has an extensive range of snacks and drinks and serves an excellent breakfast. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. Being situated near the convention centre the hotel is only a short walk to the metro and only 2 stops from the historical quarter and marina. Would recommend.",5,2015,05,23
12,Beautiful,"Stayed here after a trans Atlantic  cruise. Service was great, staff was friendly and restaurant was excellent. Very modern, clean and comfortable. They even let us check in at 11 AM when all we wanted to do was drop off our luggage",5,2015,05,20
12,Spacious Room,"I was pleasantly surprised by the spacious guest room and bathroom.  Nice bath amenities.  The front desk was always busy and not super helpful, but not unhelpful either.  

Great location - easy 10 min walk to metro and really close to the Magic Fountains.  I would stay here again!",4,2015,05,19
12,Stay For Before Cruise Departure,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fira Center for a night pre- and post- cruise out of Barcelona.  While not quite walking distance it was a quick and easy taxi ride to Las Ramblas/Gothic Quarter, Cruise Port and Sagrada Familia.  There is also a mall (a converted bull fighting arena) that is walking distance from the hotel.  The hotel was very comfortable and they were able to check us in early each time we arrived.  Taxi's were always readily available and the front desk staff was very accommodating.  We had one dinner at the hotel and is was very frustrating.  It took a long time for the waiter to acknowledge our presence and the food was not worth the wait.  There are a few restaurants near the hotel, but we did not try them.",4,2015,05,19
12,Huge rooms in a nice business hotel,"The size of the rooms is what makes this hotel great. You have a huge space in a standard room. Two king size beds, a working desk, two chairs, and a huge bathroom with a walk in shower and a separate bathtub. The check-in and check-out service was not very efficient, but the overall service was good. I was there for a business conference, and the meeting rooms were all good. In some of the meeting rooms we had to pay extra for Wi-Fi, and that's not acceptable being a business hotel. The location is alright, but if I had been in Barcelona for a vacation, I would have stayed closer to the old town and the La Rambla.",4,2015,05,17
12,Peace and serenity in Barcelona,"Chose this hotel to be a little way from the bustle of the centre of the city. Close to the Magic Fountains, MNAC and the Miro Foundation. Lovely rooms,beds,linens and bathroom. Staff superb. Enjoyed being looked after in the Club Lounge by Raphael and the others.",5,2015,05,14
12,Good business hotel ,"Everything you would expect from a Crowne Plaza. Nice quiet room. Good service. Location is a bit out of the way, but it's not too far from the airport. The 'express' lunch menu is not exactly express.... Took too long to get served, we had to abandon dessert to get back to meetings. ",4,2015,05,14
12,Does what it says on the tin,"We chose this hotel as part of a BA package and were very pleased with the outcome.  It is close to Montjuic and the Place Espanya.  The room was large with a view overlooking MNAC, we could hear the music from the Font Magic at night.  Each day our coffee, chocolates, water and biscotti were replenished.  The bathroom was clean with a large tub, spacious shower cubicle, and loo and bidet in their own enclosure.

We didn't eat in the restaurant (or are there two?) as we wanted to try lots of local food.  We did have drinks in the Piano bar and a sandwich before our flight.

Entry to the spa is 25 Euro for hotel guests, which I think is a bit pricey for a swim and sauna, lovely as it looked.

Breakfast was not in our deal and at 18 Euro per person would have to be amazing to justify the price.

Wi-fi was free throughout the hotel.",5,2015,05,10
12,More than 5 star hotel,"Honestly it deserves 5 star hotel and magnificent indoor swimming pool and SPA, comfort beds and bed sheets with enough room spaces, cool room air conditioning, separate shower and bathtub in toilet, the hotel located 2km from city center of Barcelona and 300 meters from trian station.",4,2015,05,09
12,Comfort and great guest service with one exception.........,"What a comfortable hotel in a great location!  Our double queen room with a Stress-less recliner could not have been better.  The bath was spacious with a tub and separate huge walk-in shower.  The staff was quick to help us with the HVAC settings as they were a little hard to decipher, and each room was a little different.  We stayed here on our way out to sea and on the return.  We had drinks in the bar and then to the dining room for dinner; Our one exception to great guest service.   We did not get waited on --drinks or anything- for quite a while 20-30 minutes,  so long that I went back to the bar and ordered drinks.  The bartender was appalled and kept saying ""you are at the restaurant here and you are getting no drinks?""  Yes--I took my drink with me and he brought the others to our table at the restaurant, which I might add are at opposite ends of the lobby.  We did not eat there for breakfast or on our return stay.  There are some small cafes near the hotel and  we had breakfast there.",4,2015,05,08
12,Suprise birthday weekend for my husband,"An amazing experience! Being used to 5 star hotels, i can only recommend this hotel for its service and quality . We had a lovely comfortable room with acces to the club lounge,  the staff were all very professional and attentive. The breakfast buffet on the club floor is excellent with a lot of choices, as for the lounge you can enjoy your glass of champagne with delicious tapas. If you want to feel special, this is the place to be!",5,2015,05,08
12,Wow,"Booked the Crowne Plaza through British Airways for my wife's 40th birthday, as it was a special occasion we booked an Executive room with Club Lounge access. Arrived at the hotel via private transfer, driver spoke brilliant English and gave us some fantastic tips about the city and was a really great ambassador for the city.
On arrival we were taken straight from reception to the Club Lounge for check in, greeted by Raphael one of the 2 excellent staff who run the Club Lounge. I had booked Champagne for our arrival and was all sorted and organised in our room, no fuss just done! Thank you!
Club Lounge is fantastic, nibbles and drinks from 7am till 11pm, with a massive breakfast room, talking of which breakfast was fantastic. Ate in the hotel restaurant on our first night, staff excellent and food great. Room was massive with huge bathroom, had a view across the city. 
All in all a fantastic city to visit and this hotel and its staff are superb. Some excellent restaurants nearby, only a short walk from the Bull Ring shopping centre with awesome views, and a short walk from where the City Bus Tours start on Orange Route.This is a great way to travel and see the city. Taxi's readily available outside the hotel and ours cost 26 Euros to El Prat Airport.
Thanks to all involved in making our stay so special.",5,2015,05,07
12,Very good value,"We decided to have a quick break to Barcelona and as our ""wish list"" hotels were ridicilously expensive, this came out at a bargain price. It was an extremely pleasant surprise and - as luck would have it  -within 10 minutes walking distance of the two restaurants we'd booked.
Rooms were spacious ( we were upgraded) and the facilities excellent. Large, comfortable bed and liked the little touches such as the kit for helping you sleep better  - not that we needed that. Only teeny, teeny gripe was that the gel fixed in the shower was empty when we got into the room and was never replaced througout our stay but that really is hardly worth mentioning.
A brisk 20 min walk will see you in the centre of the city so it's not too much of a hardship that you're not right in the centre of the action. Breakfasts were limited but nice enough (although my husband was craving baked beans!) but all in all it was a great choice and somewhere we'd definitely consider returning to.",4,2015,05,06
12,Good hotel/facilities - pretty ordinary breakfast,"Went to this hotel for a conference.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the rooms are huge with an equally big bathroom.  Very modern and clean overall.
The hotel is located near the Palace and the Fountain (lights show from 9pm-11pm during summer), and near the Olympic Village (which is a great walking area for fitness).
Internet was free and fast so that is always appreciated.
From a conference perspective, the facilities are very good and food was enjoyable.
My biggest gripe was the breakfast...it was very limited and the hot food selection was ordinary.  Also getting a coffee took forever!  It seems they need to cater for large groups such as ourselves, and so they provide the bare essentials in order for it to be quick and easy. 
Overall a good hotel, however I would find somewhere else for breakfast and save your money!!",4,2015,05,04
12,Very nice!!!,"The hotel lies in a quiet spot of Barcelona, but that is no problem. 5 min. walk to Placa de España tube, and you are 4 stops from La Rambla.
Big rooms with exellent beds, and luxurious bathroom. 55 inch tv, complimentary cofee, etc.
Breakfast good, but a bit expensive. Ouside the main entrance, on the right, slightly up the street is a nice local bakery which is an exellent breakfaast alternative. 
Will return!",5,2015,05,02
12,Spotless!,"Stayed there for 2 nights for around 150 euros the room for 2 adults and 2 kids (king size bedroom and a coach). Everything went very well. The room was big, modern, comfortable and clean although it had no view. Taxis are waiting at the door all the time. The gym is sort of small because they give priority to the spa which does only allow adults. This was the only negative aspect cause the pool seen in the Internet site is actually the spa and no kids are allowed.
Breakfast was ok and there is a very nice person at the bar till late if the restaurant is closed. 

We did not eat at the restaurant though.
I would go back and I strongly recommend it for the price payed.
",5,2015,04,30
12,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff, good for conferences and events","I stayed here earlier this week on a business trip, organising a conference here for 160 people.  It is a large hotel with lots of conference facilities, traditional Barcelona style, very friendly excellent staff, nothing is too difficult for them to arrange, the rooms are all very large with excellent facilities.  Good location, very close to the airport, would highly recommend also for any occasion.",5,2015,04,30
12,Nice positioned between exhibition centre and real centre,"Hotel all right, the rooms some small problems, the staff I have not much been in 3 days... The room that I have received had huge bathroom with handicapped facilities, although I did not ask for so it we extremely very unfriendly ..",4,2015,04,28
12,Fantastic Hotel!,"I was very impressed with this hotel, the location is excellent for visiting the tourist attractions and every member of staff provided the highest level of service! The hotel is newly decorated with high quality facilities, and lovely food.

Thank you to Miguel and Carina for their support in advance of our visit, and to Bruno, Rapha and Cristina for their help, advice and support during our stay. I spend a lot of time in hotels and I can think of very few that live up to the very high standard of the Crowne Plaza, Fira Center Barcelona!!",5,2015,04,27
12,Excellent Hotel,"I was in Barcelona ,Spain,on a business trip.I was in Crown plaza Hotel for 1 week.The room was very spacious and I had a deluxe room.It was so clean and had a good service.Of course my room view wasn't good.The room was very comfortable everywhere.Sleep quality was so good.Tea and coffee services was a good idea and you could make tea or coffee whenever you want free of charge.The receptionists were very friendly and also extremely helpful,and other staff as well.The location was so nice near Magic fountains,Espana plaza,Areana de Barcelona and also 10 minutes to exhibition Gran via Fira center.I highly recommend for staying in this Hotel.I will certainly be staying here again.",4,2015,04,24
12,Top notch service and fittings,"My wife, three year old daughter and I arrived in Barcelona and whizzed through customs, onto the bus and straight to the hotel (only a 5 minute walk from the aerobus stop at Plaza Espana) in about 35 minutes, which meant that we arrived hours and hours early for the 1500 check-in.  We only hoped to be allowed to drop our bags, but to our delight were able to check in immediately.  The helpful front desk clerk even offered a few polite phrases in Finnish to my wife when he saw her passport.

The room was spacious and extremely well-appointed with two comfortable double beds, a massive new lcd t.v. and a pair of arm chairs.   As a tip, many of the channels had multiple audio streams, so for example we were able to set the disney channel to output English audio for my daughter. 

The bathroom had two showers, a bath, bidet and a separate toilet cubicle.  Everything was tidy on arrival and the cleaners refreshed the sundries and made the room up unobtrusively every day of our stay.  When we asked for an extra towel it was at our room in less than two minutes.

Temperature control in the room was excellent and the room was very quiet and easy to sleep in, especially given that there was good lighting segmentation, which allowed me to stay up reading while the others slept.

The only disappointment in our stay was that we had wanted to take our daughter to the  pool and then the sauna at the spa, but were informed that the spa was not appropriate for children.

The location, as mentioned, is very close to the Plaza Espana, magic fountain and Olympic park, but around a 25-30 minute walk to the city center.  There is an underground station only a 5 minute walk away at Poble Sec. I'd also point out that the thing that looks like a stadium at the bottom of the magic fountain area is actually a shopping mall.  My wife was disappointed to only discover this at the end of our trip!

On checkout staff were once again friendly and helpful.  All in all a very pleasant stay.",5,2015,04,24
12,"Great hotel, good location, fab spa and breakfast!","This is a lovely modern hotel about 5 minutes walk from the Place d' Espanya which is on the 1, 3 and 8 metro lines so it's very handy for travelling around Barcelona.  Also, the Aerobus (5.3 Euros) and TMB bus (2.15 Euros) stops just 3 minutes walk around the corner which goes directly to the airport so much cheaper than the cab which is 30 Euros for the same journey.

The reception at the Crowne Plaza is big and modern and welcoming with quite a few staff at reception.  I got there early around 1pm but luckily was allowed to check in even though the check-in time was officially 3pm.  The room was large, clean with great lighting. Even with two double beds the room had lots of room to move around.  There was a nice Nespresso machine but don't use it as the Nespresso pods are 2.10 Euros each (you can get 10 for around 3 Euros in the Nespresso shops so remember to bring your own!).  The bathroom was large, clean with a separate shower to the bathtub which was a joy to use (although the shower head could have been descaled as this was building up). 

The spa facilities was fantastic - there was a lovely pool, sauna, steam room, dry steam room and gym.  Remember to get a treatment (express massage is cheap at 40 Euros for 30 mins) as you will be charged for using these facilities at 25 euros a go!  Hence, it's better value for money to get a nice treatment.  

We had a great stay at this lovely hotel.  The only bad thing was the chambermaids did not replace our complimentary toiletries or the free coffee sachets and complimentary water which we drank. Even after calling reception about this, our request was ignored so this made our stay a bit sour.",4,2015,04,23
12,Fabulous service,This hotel sorted us two rooms after our reserved hotel booked four months earlier cancelled our booking whilst we were flying to Barcelona .  Very accomodationg opened the bar and enabled us to have a drink after our journey .  Concerned about us women going out if the hotel early hours in the morning.  Rooms very spacious well furnished.  Very comfortable beds.  Breakfast no cheap but so worth all we paid for it quality hotel,5,2015,04,22
12,"Great visit, great hotel","I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday treat and stayed for 4 days. Upon the check in, we've been upgraded to junior suite as a complimentary for being a gold member. Superb room! Thank you Joanna.
The hotel itself was really nice. There's a restaurant served a good food( esp tapas and paella) even though I'm a bit disappointed about the breakfast in the morning. All the hot buffet was cold, the salad(grated carrot) wasn't fresh. 
The location was brilliant for a walking journey to the mall and lots of restaurants nearby. It only costs us €7 to the Camp Nou Stadium. 
All and all, I would be happy to go back and stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,04,20
12,Nice area with big rooms,"My brother was staying here for the weekend and i visited him twice. The rooms were bigger than the normal size in Barcelona. They always looked very clean and the service was very good from the people of the hotel although we were not staying there but we were just visitors. the location is a bit out of the center but with the metro being few steps away, you can be in the middle of everything in few minutes. Highly recommended for people who want to stay not in the center and love to have big rooms.",4,2015,04,20
12,Clean and quiet,"Crown Plaza is a larg, but personal hotel outside the most busy center of Barcelona. It is in walking distance to every site to be visited, has a quite athmosphare and good service. Late check-out is available in order to do the last few visits before you hit the airport. Highly recommended.",4,2015,04,19
12,Great stay - excellent value - clean rooms - good beds,"We enjoyed our stay at the Crown Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center.  The hotel is very clean, with modern upgraded rooms, reliable free wifi.  Points to consider:
* The beds were very comfortable, noticeably better than many other places we have stayed in Europe.
* Hotel is a good 5 minute walk to the Espanya metro station.  I generally prefer to be closer... but it's no problem to walk it in good weather.
* There are restaurants in the area, but the better restaurant options seem to be in different areas of town. 
* The Magic Fountain is an awesome evening attraction... and this hotel is an easy walk from there.
* Staff was very helpful, friendly and good for English speakers.
* Hotel prices are a great value, compared to the prices in the more populated areas.

We did not use the restaurant, so cannot comment there.  I liked staying the in Plaza Espanya area... it's off the major tourist path, but is a major hub for airport buses, metro and train service (for day trips out of the city).  The staff also had some good recommendations for restaurants in the general area when we did not feel like headed over to the more populated areas.  I would stay here again for sure.",5,2015,04,13
12,Excellent family Christmas stay,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 days during Christmas and the overall experience was excellent. We had a room with two double beds which more than accommodated us two and our five year old son. The room itself is very spacious and with  all the amenities needed for a relaxed stay (smart tv, minibar,coffee and tea). What we enjoyed most was dinner at the hotel's restaurant and room service. The food was very good and the prices reasonable for Barcelona standards. The location, even though not very central, is ideal if you don't want to  be right in the tourist track. Metro station is  within five minutes walk and the same goes for the Monjuick Magic fountains.",5,2015,04,09
12,Superb friendly service. ,"From check in to check out the service was exceptionally friendly yet still professional. From supplying maps and offering tourist advise to arranging room upgrades and extended check out times, nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Our room was spotlessly clean and plenty big enough for a long time weekend. Breakfast was plentiful but the staff did seem a little stretched when the restaurant was full. Overall I thought the hotel staff did a great job and made us feel most welcome. I would certainly stay again.",4,2015,04,08
12,Nice hotel in big city,"If there is a Crowne Plaza where I am going I will always take a look as generally speaking they are a reasonably ujp market brand. This hotel certainly had excellent rooms - very large and comfortable and I must admit that I do like a good sized room. The TV was superb - in fact the largest TV screen I have ever seen in an hotel so this was a rather impressive feature. The bed was comfortable and the facilities perfectly good.

Breakfast was unfortunately not up to the standard we expected and I do enjoy the international breakfast which is generally served at good hotels. However I think this may have been more of a glitch than anything and it would not stop me going again.

This hotel is situated right in the middle of Barcelona and of course there are many local restaurants and so forth to visit if you choose not to dine in , which we did not but it was a Sunday evening and there was no dining inside.

Parking is in an adjacent car park - not cheap but where is in Barcelona?

We thought this was excellent value for money but recently looking to book again I was stunned by how the prices had increased. So check it out but beware of a price hike. We in fact decided to stay elsewhere because of this.",4,2015,04,08
12,Excellent staff and comfortable bed,"This hotel is clean and near subway station.. Walking distance to National museum.   We stayed at several hotels in Spain, I believed the front desk staff at this hotel was the best.  They communicated very well, pleasant and offered their recommendation honestly.
We planed to visit Gaudi's places, they recommended us to buy tickets from the hotel's computer and that was a good move.
Their WIFI is excellent.
I love my room.  It is spacious, clean.  The bathroom is nice.
It is a big hotel......",5,2015,04,08
12,Lovely staff nice quiet area,"We booked a british airways mini break and the hotel was great.we arrived mid morning and were immediatly able to go to the club lounges and check in and our room602 was a very nice suite 2 very comfortable beds a small balcony looking over the city , a very comfortable lounge with very large TV . Amenities were all white company the bathroom was split in two, shower area and basin then glass door to toilet and bath with a door into either side.
We had breakfast in the club lounge and there was a good choice freshly squeezed orange juice and Moët for a bucks fizz ( nice touch) bread meats cheese fruit yoghurts pastries. Hot bacon sausages eggs potatoes. Plenty of cereal so all good.
The staff in the lounge were all very courteous helpful and very friendly , Raffael, Bruno and olga.so a big thank you to them for making our stay memorable.
I did especially love moet on tap!!! 
We had dinner one eve ending and it was very good the paella was great and and the turbot and lamb especially you.
The hotel is minutes from th museum of Catalan art and the fountain does a light show at 9pm great to watch.a tourist bus stop is  near too which takes u straight up to mont juic the cable car and Olympic park .taxi down to the port isapprox10 euros. A little further out of town be we liked it .",4,2015,04,07
12,"Great Hotel, Very accommodating staff","Spent 5 nights here in March 2015.  Took the executive package so we had access to the Club Lounge and the service was awesome.  Olga at the Club Lounge was a pleasure to deal with.  There was a full breakfast, snacks and alcholic drinks any time of the day and you could also take your guests (two guests per couple).  The rooms were large and very clean and modern.  

Hotel was walking distance to Montjuic and Plaza Espanya and about half hour to the main centre - Les Ramblas.  Not a problem as we did a lot of walking in Barcelona.  The best way to see the city.  Beautiful area with lots of restaurants, shopping etc.  Would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015,04,07
12,City Break,Excellent hotel and staff for a 3 night short city break and tour that we had in Barcelona. Location just out of main city center in Montjuic and close to museums and restaurants (5 minute cab ride to las Ramblas or harbor). Neighborhood felt very safe to walk around.,5,2015,04,06
12,"Nice, Recommended","The Hotel is in a nice central location. Rooms are spacious and provide a modern clean finish. If you are in, I would recommend this location:
a) Most of the tours that start are pretty close (between 1 to 2kms) by walk. Alternatively, you can take the taxis.
b) The hotel has its underground parking which for us was very convenient. Do note that there is another commercial parking right opposite it - so do take care that you enter the right parking. 

The parking in Barcelona normally cost EUR 3/hr and around Euros 35-40/day. However, hotel guests enjoy much better rates (only if parked in their own underground parking). 

Overall a good hotel and I definitely recommend it.",4,2015,04,05
12,Positively surprised,"The  hotel is situated close to Montjuic, where several attractions are placed, however it is not a central position in the downtown. 
I was positively surprised with the quality/price ratio of the hotel. We have got a room with two king-beds, very nice furnished, any sound from outside came in. An extra large TV Samsung with smart hub (you can watch YouTube, etc.) was in the room as well as nice furnishing, a teakettle with accessories as well as a coffeemaker. Bathroom was equipped with a bath as well as shower enclosure and a bidet.
The wireless was included in the price of room. You can use the underground parking for 18€ per day.
Breakfast was rich with variety, clean, but straight. There was a lot of vegetables, which I generally miss.

Conclusion: when I will go to Barcelona, I already know where to stay.",5,2015,03,25
12,Great location and hotel,"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and can honestly say it is one of the best we have ever stayed in from this chain.  From the attentive reception staff through to a fabulous room, we really could not fault this hotel.  Only ate breakfast at the hotel, this was of high quality with plenty of choice for a vegetarian.  Highly recommended",5,2015,03,24
12,Modern design and spacious rooms ,"+ pretty central location (walking distance to various great restaurants, bars, nightclubs, sights), Metro just 5 mins walk 
+ Modern and stylish design 
+ spacious rooms 
+ Modern fitness center (well equipped!) 

- had a bad smell in the bathroom 
- service at check-in and check-out a little slow ",4,2015,03,22
12,Warmth of staffs,Very comfortable and centrally located close to ARENAS with large size room and good bath a truly enjoyable place at Barcelona.Amenities worth the price which in any case much lower than five star properties in India.Enjoying every moment and and hope next 3 days truly memorable for our family.,5,2015,03,19
12,"Great Hotel, Great Location","The Hotel location was excellent, an easy 15 minute stroll to Espanya Metro station. The Hotel is well appointed, we stayed in Club room. Room and bathroom were spacious, clean and had all amenities. Breakfast had good selection, club lounge food was good if a little predictable and usually not 'hot'. Staff were very helpful and efficient.",5,2015,03,16
12,Comfort in style,"Within walking distance of the art museum and metro and only a 20 minute walk from la ramblas, this hotel is ideal for the business guest or tourist. Fantastic customer service and facilities with little extras such as bed perfumes and little sheep shaped cookies on your pillow make all the difference. They even have a run bar with complementary water and apples and three routes mapped out. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a bit of class at a fantastic price.",5,2015,03,15
12,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Room was comfortable and big, staff was always friendly. The manager is especially helpful. Breakfast was good but I agree with other reviewers the hot items could be warmer. Hotel is in a quiet location, quick train ride away from city center. Next time I will stay closer to city center but for price and offerings I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,14
12,"Really, really good","Very nice hotel, in a nice part of town. Very close to the Museum of Fine Art and lovely parklands. The old bullring close by is converted into a shopping mall with good reataurants on the top level. 
The hotel is smart and the check-in desk staff - delightful. The standard room is large and the wifi - good. The pool is actually a spa, and is only avaialble for a fee, not good at all.
Dinner at the hotel restaurant l'Aria was really lovely. Lots of sea food on offer.
Totally recommended.",5,2015,03,12
12,You get what you pay for - Superb situation!,"The name of the hotel seemed different from our booking which was the Fira Palace.  In any event after a little confusion we found the hotel and the check in was efficient and packed full of information - very good!  An issue with the cold water in our room led to us asking for a room change.  This was actioned immediately and we received a complementary sweet tray and a letter of apology.  The hotel really knows the value of looking after its guests.  The room was excellent, spacious and with great facilities, I couldn't fault it.  The breakfast was plentiful and with good selections.  A small point was that much of the hot food was luke warm at best as the hot lights appeared to be ineffective.  Well situated for Espanya metro station and the fountains (a 2 minute walk) with the converted Bull Ring with many distances being 10 minutes away.  I couldn't fault the service, staff or accommodation.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,03,01
12,"Swimming pool was supposed to be free, was not.","In general not bad, quite comfortable and clean. Good service. I suppose I expected more after reading opinion on the official site. The swimming pool was supposed to be free, but it turned out to be extra charge 25 e / day ( not worth the money) . The gym very basically equipped. The breakfast was supposed to be 14 e / as per the official website, but at the reception they asked 16 e / yet in the rooms the flyer still saing 14 e. Not a big thing but you feel uncomfortable. 
Breakfast very good. Cleaning service and the general reception very good. 
In comparison to other 4 star hotels expensive ( 150 e / night )  but not exceptional. I decided to stay in this hotel only because they offered the free facility pool and the gym. I will not stay in this hotel again.",3,2015,03,01
12,"Good location, good vacation","Return visit to Barcelona and chose this hotel based on location and review - we were not disappointed. We were greeted warmly by reception and given a large and very comfortable room which had everything we needed for a three night stay. Admittedly we didn't spend much time in the hotel so our experiences were limited to our room and the breakfast restaurant. We thought the breakfast buffet was great - good range and quality - maybe we'd prefer more the warm items a little hotter - with attentive staff in a very calm and quiet room with plenty of space. We ate in local restaurants so didn't sample the hotel's evening offerings. 

The room was really spacious with separate shower and bath and the usual courtesy toiletries, gowns,  and a typical hospitality tray. Although we didn't use them we thought that the mini bar and room service prices were really good. The TV had a few English channels - enough for us to see the news headlines, and wi-fi was fast and free.

We used taxis and also the underground from nearby Plaza Espana to get around - sharing a T10 ticket for 10 Euros. We were  disappointed to find the magic fountain (just a hundred yards or so away) was closed for maintenance during our stay - then puzzled and pleased when it actually opened on the weekend! The views from the Bullring Shopping Centre at Plaza Espana are really good (and free) day and night. 

The area is away from some of the major tourist attractions (although some are on the doorstep) and we found it a very quiet location but enough evening food choice.

A very enjoyable short break and we'd use the hotel again without hesitation if we re-visit.",5,2015,02,22
12,"Very comfortable, slightly away from it all, club service recommended","Stayed for a week with my wife in this pleasant hotel adjacent to the Fira Centre (which looks closed). The magic fountains have lost their magic for the time being - broken! As was the case for the Montjuic Funicular!

However taxis are available all day outside the Crowne Plaza, but a refreshing walk will get you to all sights. The metro or FGC from Placa España will easily get you around otherwise.

After a week you see all sides of the hotel's offerings and whether these are consistent. Our experience of the Club Lounge leads us to recommend this especially.

The discreet and private check in in the lounge was a welcome service. Bruno managed the Club facilities for all the time we were in the hotel save for his days off. He was patient, amenable, and thoughtful throughout - a great asset to the hotel.

Breakfast, Nespresso coffee, snacks, tapas (at lunchtime and early evening), top shelf drinks all day including Moët on ice, provide most of what any traveller, business or leisure might need.

Recommended - this hotel is a worthy representative of IHG - this coming from a Platinum Elite member.
",5,2015,02,18
12,Not for breakfast,"Stayed second week of February 2015, room, staff, service outstanding. Club lounge very good, nice selection of tapas and drinks.  The only thing not up to Crowne Plaza standard was the breakfast, in the lounge or downstairs in the restaurant everything was cold, eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes.  I know it difficult to maintain hot food on a buffet but other Crowne Plaza's I have stayed were able to accomplish this.  We brought this to the attention of the staff and as of this post it has not been rectified.  Bruno in the lounge has been more than helpful and tried to correct the breakfast issue.  Sunday maid service did not show up and had to call for service which was completed at 1500hrs.",4,2015,02,15
12,Truly great,"Stayed here for a few nights in December and it was great.

Room is VERY large and very clean. Strong wifi in the room, nice staff and decent food in the hotel bar area (though I ordered the same thing two nights in a row and each plate was substantially different). Easy access to restaurants and convenience stores for cheap food and snacks.

A bit far from the main attractions, but this place was so nice and quiet that I'd definitely stay here again. And, it's a short taxi ride from the main train station.

This is probably the nicest Crowne Plaza that I've ever stayed in.",5,2015,02,15
12,Classy hotel,"Loved this hotel . So clean and comfortable . Really convenient location about 2 minutes walk from the fountains and not far from cafes , restaurants , tourist bus stops and shops . We stayed for 4 nights and would definitely book this hotel again . We actually stayed here in November 2013 but I guess my review is overdue !",5,2015,02,10
12,Great Hotel and location,"We stayed there for a long weekend and it was worth the trip and the stay.  The location was perfect and it was within walking distance of some noteworthy sites.  The area is interesting and a bit on the eccentric side.  The dancing fountains 3 blocks away were fantastic and was a congregating point once the sun went down.

We stayed on the club level and the room was more than we expected.  There was a separate sitting room that doubled as a second bedroom.  The bathroom was spacious, not like the cramped bathrooms you find the majority of time.  The staff was very helpful and directed us to nice locations around Barcelona.  The one complaint was the food recommendation which turned out to be a disaster.  The best thing for me was the bed;  Not what you are thinking.  I had one of the most peaceful sleeps in many a month.  It was so good that I had to call back and get the brand of pillows so I could purchase them.  I can't wait to travel to Barcelona again as this will be at the top of the list right behind the Hotel Arts.",4,2015,02,01
12,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"Highly recommended. Stayed for a 6 nights in January using Platinum points and couldn't have been happier. It's located centrally to all the areas for tourists but ion a quieter street without all the chaos of some other areas. It was about 30 mins to the hotel from the airport in afternoon traffic.  The trip back to the airport in the morning only took about 20 mins.  We were never more than a 10 min taxi to any place we wanted to go with a metro station within 5 to 8 minutes walking for longer destinations or if you don't want to take a taxi around the central part of town.  The taxi's were always out front so never a problem getting one.  

The hotel lobby is elegant and spacious with several sitting areas, a lounge, restaurant and nice business center with 6 or 8 Mac desktops and printer. Check in was exceptional and friendly. Our room on the 5th floor was large and comfortable and the beds were especially comfortable compared to other European or Asian beds that are rock hard.  There was plenty of space for unpacking, a small fridge, and the bath and shower were very clean and stylish.  The 55in Samsung TV was awesome. We did not have a chance to try the spa and pool but were a little disappointed the gym was in the spa and therefore required a daily fee to use it. The wifi worked very well with good speed.  

We opted for the Club Lounge so that we could take advantage of the daily breakfast buffet and drinks and snacks throughout the day, as well as evening cocktails and tapas.  We highly recommend it and feel it was well worth the price especially with the stocked Moet Chandon champagne and soft drinks.  The breakfast had a nice selection of hot, cold, and bakery items although it would have been nice to have some variation at least a few times during the week.  

The lounge team was helpful and welcoming and we especially loved Bruno's warm and friendly attitude and helpful nature.  He made our days more than special and took a genuine interest in our comfort and activities, making sightseeing suggestions and also reservations. His service was top notch and will be missed.

As others commented, we recommend taking an address card from the hotel with you along with the former name of the hotel as we did encounter a few drivers who did not know the new name.  The Magic Fountain is a 5 minute walk and shouldn't be missed. Easy to walk to in the evening after a day of sightseeing.  Plaza Espana and the huge shopping mall is also close and easily walkable. If you're looking for local sim cards there are several options at the shopping mall.  The other tourist districts weren't far at all, but we opted for the easy taxi ride around 6-10 euros, saving our legs for plenty of walking once we reached our destinations.  We especially loved the gorgeous views of the sea from the nearby overlook area near Montjuic Funicular (Skyride), less than a 10 min taxi from the hotel. THere's a quaint little restaurant with the most incredible views for a cocktail or tapas.  From here you can ride short trip down to the beach.

Next trip to Barcelona we would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,01,30
12,Excellent place to stay and excellent service,Staff made you feel very welcome and were very friendly nothing was to much trouble. Excellent service throuhout the hotel and excellent food with an excellent selection of breakfast tosuut all nationalaties. And luxurious rooms with very comfy beds!! Thank you will ost definetely stay there again in the future!!!,5,2015,01,25
12,Excellent Hotel,"Well located, helpful and friendly staff, very  comfortable, food very good. Professional conference facilities were ideal for a large conference. The old bullring is close by, now a shopping mall. Overall the hotel, facilities and location are so good, this will be an annual event for me.",4,2015,01,23
12,Comfy rooms,"The Crowne Plaza Fira Center offered wonderful spacious & comfortable rooms! We had 2 rooms with 2 queen beds in each room. There was plenty of space between each bed as well as on each side of the bed. Lots of counter space and a spacious sitting area. The rooms were clean & nicely decorated. We opted out on the breakfast as it was pricey & didn't have good reviews. There are 2 cafe's across the street offering great breakfast for half the price. It's about a 20 min ride from the airport. I appreciated that there were always taxi's queued up outside when we stepped out. The hotel is about an 8 Euro ride to the centre, but we always had difficulty getting the taxi drivers to understand where to take us when we were going back to the hotel. I would recommend that you have the address readily available when you step into the taxi & even be able to give them crossroads. One evening we were taken way further north & the taxi driver was calling his colleagues for help all on my tab! I would stay at this hotel again in a heart beat!",4,2015,01,20
12,Two Nights in Barcelona!!!,"Love this hotel, customer service at the front desk was great!!! we loved our room. Hotel is centrally located. We had breakfast in the hotel, the breakfast was alright. Not much selections. I would recommend staying in this hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2015,01,08
12,"Crowne Plaza, Fira center Barcelona","A very modern and new hotel. I liked the standard very much. In addition, they have a large fitness center with modern equipment (not seen a treadmill like this) and a fantastic SPA, i.e. a small swimming pool with water massage and warm beds to relax in. Also, different saunas if you like that. The Wi-fi works well. The hotel is located close to Plaza Espanyol and the olympic arena, a 10 minute drive from La Rambla.",5,2015,01,08
12,Great Hotel and great location,"I went to Barcelona in December and stayed here for 5 days, absolutely love it, price was good, great location very nice hotel and the staff was very nice. From there it is very easy to go anywhere in Barcelona, we took the bus from the airport and dropped us off at Plaça d'Espanya, walked two blocks and we were at the hotel. We stayed at the Hyatt in Paris a week earlier, paid twice the money and the service were awful. This hotel simply worth the stay",5,2015,01,08
12,Excelent !,"The Staff was very Friendly and very professional with helpfull  suggestions city maps and so on.
THe Spa Center is new and very Clean and TOp ! 
THe Room with Kingsize Bed is very very Spacy and Clean ....  I was surprised ....
Located near the Fountains ... Nice :)",5,2015,01,08
12,New Year trip,A very well located and comfortable hotel for 5 nights. We had a sofa bed for our son and the room was large enough when it was folded out not to be in the way. Breakfast was good although perhaps unnecessary given the proximity of so many cafes and restaurants but convenient. We went to the Magic fountains a short walk away to bring in the new year and watched the fireworks from the hotel as the square was a bit crowded for children. A lovely trip overall.,5,2015,01,08
12,Amazing Christmas Vacation,We stayed for 6 nights at the Crown Plaza Fira Center. What a great hotel. Very close (5-10 minutes walking distance) to Plaza Espana and the Magic Fountain. Easy to catch public transport and Taxis are also always available in front of the hotel. Some very nice restaurants around the hotel. Very spacious rooms that made the 3 of us very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful especially the Club Lounge Team. The breakfast in the Club Lounge is a very nice spread and more than enough variety for a full breakfast to get ready for the day exploring this great City. Thank you Crown Plaza team for a very pleasant stay. We will be back.,5,2015,01,05
12,A memorable delight to behold...,"As always, Intercontinental Chain of Hotels seem to go the Extra Mile to pursue excellence in the ranks of the Luxury Hotel Line, and this Crowne Plaza Barcelona pulls it off without any bumps in the road. From check-in to check-out, they always seemed to be a step ahead. Our pleasant stay at this location near the Fira Conference Center near Plaza Espana was ideal for it's proximity to either Metro mere pleasant 5 minute walk or nearby Rail Station which was one Metro Stop Away. On-site Restaurant was superb, as was the local eateries in the general surrounding area. 

 Especially nice was the Les Arenas Shopping Center, a bygone Bull Ring turned Shopping Center was a treat. The Rooftop Restaurant Row was not only a lovely lookout of the area, but fun to walk and enjoy the people watching in the evening air. And restaurants here as well exceptional, everything you would need, in the way of multi-cultural cuisine.

We enjoyed the our Upgraded Suite room was by far the most well appointed Inter-Continental room we have yet stay in. Separate Bedroom with both 50"" LED TV was great, with comfy stress-Iess loungers. I suppose the layout could be called Casual Business modern in the sense of having every practical amenity needed for a comfortable stay. Huge Bathroom, separate large shower and bath. It pays to be a ICH Gold Elite Member as as Gold Ambassador, they treat you as royalty, look into it..!! Breakfast was well appointed, and usual Euro-Fair, all one needs to get through the day. As for a soft pillow if you do not care for latex that are standard in the room, and Ice is on floor, but not noisy.

The high point of this 9 day stay was our twice daily visit to the Club Lounge hosted by Bruno & Lisa, which greeted us twice daily with there beaming smile and accommodating personality made this a true 5 star stay for us. Bruno was always at hand with helpful suggestions, friendly conversation and knowledge of suggestions for the day made us feel pampered. Always going above and beyond to be accommodating while time was spent either at breakfast or in the evening Tapas Hours. Lisa, as well, made sure everything was perfect and made sure we understood all that was at hand available for our enjoyment. Both of them were the perfect hosts. 
Thank you both so much.

We hope to return to this location soon, as the stay was such a rememberable event, being our second time in Barcelona made it feel like the first. Lots to do locally, amazingly area so full of many sights, museums, lovely walks and of course lots of Tapas, Shopping, Grand Cathedrals, aside from the jaw dropping magnificence of the yet unfinished outside of the Sagrada Famalia. This alone let us awe struck, it cannot be explained as it is truly magnificent. Inside is finished, minus proper seating, but it is highly recommended to be truly in the grace of a Genius Architect, Antoini Gaudi..!! As well, in winter, Fri-Sat 7:30pm, the Font Magica, Magic Fountain marvels the eye, such colorful Event as well, it is a must see, only 3 minutes away.  Lots of walking, bring good shoes..!! Remember, tradition in Spain, Dinner is Late, Tapas around 5-7pm, Dinner around 8:30-10pm to start. Tapas and wine is easy to make a meal out of and inexpensive....Salut..!

BTW, Take the AeroBus, follow the signs in airport Terminal 1 from El Prat (BCN) Airport. Very handy, and this Plaza Espana is the first stop, and outside the Plaza Hotel going out goes straight to airport, cannot beat this connivence. Just 5 minutes from hotel just $7EUD. By a Metro Multi-Day Pass at the Kiosk, just press the British Flag for English. The 3-5 day Multi Pass is good for up to 3 people on one ticket. 

Thank you to all of you at ICH Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center for the perfect stay...!",5,2015,01,05
12,Excellent,Excellent hotel with large rooms.  Fantastic bath. Brilliant service. Walking distance to the magic fountain. A bit out of the way for other attractions. A really nice hotel for anyone. Nice and quiet area with many restaurants.,5,2015,01,04
12,Exeptional in every way,"Stayed here for 4 nights over New Year 2014. Booked an executive room with free access to the Club Lounge and could not have been treated better. From the minute we stepped into the hotel until we left, we were looked after. The staff were attentive without being in your face. The rooms were extraordinarily large and comfortable. The club lounge was definitely worth using. Breakfast was plentiful and free drinks with tapas meant it was a great place to meet prior to going out and at the end of an evening. I had my 50th birthday their and was sent a lovely bottle of iced cava to the room. In all could not fault this hotel. Will certainly be looking forward to a return visit",5,2015,01,04
12,Great stay Christmas break,"Proved to be a great location and well run hotel, great front staff ( Judith, Sandra) made things easy.Hotel was privately run until recently and has been modernised and upgraded since our last stay 3 yrs ago.
Positives - Good location - 5 mins walk to metro at Plaza Espanya and metro line to Plaza Catalunya and Sagrada Familar. Train link from airport  to Sants station which was two stops from Espanya. 
Also at Espanya Plaza is a modern shopping mall Arenas in converted Bullring.
High quality rooms on an upgrade to Executive.Exectutive room was very spacious with reclining stressless chair, 50in LCD TV, Nesspresso machine and kettle( a bonus for spain). 
Large bathroom with bath, separate shower.
Breakfast was busy but reasonable quality, hot food could have been a little warmer with better heated serving dishes - but selection was very good.
Free wifi

Had two meals at hotel restaurant - both good quality and service.
Hotel has a gym and spa - but didnt use these, although both looked of high quality.

Negatives - lifts playing up on a couple of days

Tips - Got a Hola BCN ticket at the Airport - this is was E21 for 4 days - includes the metro,trams,buses and train from airport - Makes a cheap few days.
Saw offer for 25% discount for hotel Restaurant - this was good quality and value with Al la carte and fixed menu options. 
There is an option to upgrade to a club room for E40 - this is reasonable value if you are considering bfast each day as it runs to E14 ea - Club room is well appointed with good drinks selection and warm evening nibbles served thro 7 till about 10pm.",5,2015,01,04
12,Wonderful Hotel,"Crowna Plaza has a great location, just minutes from the magic fountains! The hotel itself is wonderful! The reception and club lounge staff were amazingly helpful and went above and beyond their duty! The one downside was housekeeping! Even though the 'Do Not Disturb' sign was on the door, staff still entered the room, somethimes without knocking first! Not all items were replenished daily or bins emptied! The Spa was great, although the staff needed to be advised that the sauna needed to be turned on! The facilities though were very good! The rooms were very spacious, great decor and well presented! The views from the 5th floor were stunning!",4,2015,01,04
12,"Nice hotel, spacious rooms","We stayed at the Crown Plaza for five nights. We booked the Club Lounge for an extra 50 Euros a night which is definitely worth it. They serve snacks and drinks all day, the free-flowing Moet is nice and the breakfast buffet in the morning is of really good quality, not too big, but definitely enough selection and choices for everyone. Check-in through Lisa was very friendly and efficient. The rooms were really nice and spacious and reasonably clean, although I was not too happy with the housekeeping. Never once did they come in for turn-down service and they only restocked the free water and coffee/tea twice in two days, no big deal for us since we had the Club Lounge but for somebody without that amenity I would imagine that this is annoying. Also twice the cleaning lady burst into the room without knocking, once before 8.00 am, even though the do-not-disturb sign was on. 
The bathroom was nice and big, bathtub and shower are separate, also the toilet is separate with a door, nice. They provide you with enough shampoo/conditioner/soap/body lotion every day. Slippers are also available, bathrobe as well. We didn't always get enough towels for the tree of us, but a phone call was enough and it was taken care of. 
The fold-out sofa for my teenager was good and comfy and you could also ask for different pillows if you didn't like the ones provided. 
There is free wifi in the rooms and Lounge, speed is ok.
You can also use the business center and use their iMacs to make reservations for the Sagrada Familia online and / or print your boarding pass. Print-outs are even free which is not common in business hotels where they usually charge you.
Can't comment on the Spa, but it looked nice. The gym is equipped with state of the art equipment (Technogym), not too big but enough to squeeze in a few workouts. 
The location of the hotel was good for us, very close to the Montjuic Fountains and the Gran Via shopping mall, there is also a metro stop on Placa Espanya which is about a five-minute walk from the hotel. It is super easy and cheap to get around Barcelona on the Metro.
We like to walk and even walked to the harbour and also Sagrada Familia from the hotel, probably a 45-minute walk for both sights. Can also recommend the Big Bus Tour. You can get coupons at the hotel and save a bit on the ticket. Normally there are three lines, but only two lines run in the winter, so if you get a 2-day bus ticket, that is ideal. Along Gran Via there are lots of restaurants and Tapa bars. All in all, a great experience. Would most definitely stay at the hotel again.",4,2015,01,03
12,A perfect experience,"We stood here for four nights and caught ourselves thinking ""how can a hotel be so perfect?"" The personal is impeccable. The room and the bed unbelievable pleasant. Awesome breakfast. Not directly in the center, but very easy to reach by metro and close to the magic fountains. Also easy to reach the airport. We loved it.",5,2015,01,03
12,Fantastic experience,"Personal very kind and helpful, nice roo m and restaurant. Also well place to have your breakfast (such a lot to eat) / lunch / dinner. Hotel is located in a perfect place of the city of Barcelona, directly near Plaza Espanya. I suggest it to everyone !!!",5,2015,01,02
12,Excellent value,"Nice hotel located close to Montjuic fountains with great transport links to city centre.
Rooms are clean, spacious and quiet. Very friendly staff. 
Plenty of nice places to eat out in the areas, including the famous Tickets Bar.",5,2015,01,02
12,Almost perfect,"Stayed 7 nights so have a good sense of hotel. First, if you are in need of a hotel for the convention area, then this is perfect. If you are here only as a tourist, which we were, then you should consider the location for excellent value if you don't mind some walking and/or use of the very good metro. We liked the location because we like to walk plus appreciated the more quiet atmosphere aware from the crazy noisy city center. Nearby is the metro stop Espana which covers two lines and and one, the red line,is like the London central line, and gets you easily and quickly to the center where it is easy then to go anywhere. Many restaurants with1/2 mile or so or one could venture like we did and dined in the Gotic and beyond. All easiliy accessible via the metro or a nice long walk (1.5 miles or so). The hotel itself was exceptionally clean and cleaned. Our room was spotless and in good repair (a Jr Suite of about 400-425SQ feet despite what the room sizes on the website). Plenty of space for the room charge. Nice TVs if that matters and the internet worked fairly well with download speeds of about 4MBS. Good enough for most web surfing. We had a club access room which was nice and came with breakfast which was good and also came with the ability for drinks throughout the day. That was worth it to us. One note: there began some construction on a school yard across the street. Jackhammers started about 8:30ish am. Don't know how long that will last, but you might want to inquire if you intend to sleep in. I would stay again.",4,2014,12,29
12,Business Class,"I recently was working on a convention in Barcelona and was housed here. I expected a solid 4 star experience and that's what I got with a snitch more. The staff is extraordinarily helpful in every way. I used them to book a private car and driver for the afternoon. They delivered a wonderful experience. The room was spacious and clean. Shower had ""eh"" water pressure but was hot. Breakfast was not as good as I've had in other business hotels in Barcelona but was okay.  Housekeeping was very attentive. We often came home late and ate in the lobby bar. The staff in the lobby could not have been nicer or more accommodating! I did not use the spa but a colleague did and was very pleased.",4,2014,12,27
12,Good conveyance and relaxed environment,"We went in the 2nd week of December. By European standards, rooms were spacious. Staff is friendly and helpful. It is easily accessible from the airport, port, city center and la rambla street.
Plenty of restaurants near the hotel.
My family and I enjoyed our stay there and would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,12,24
12,Amazing long weekend break! Super rooms!,"This hotel offers a generous room size, friendly and professional service and is well located for transport links to the airport and the city centre. Breakfast could have been better so if I went again I would probably just go for a room only. Free wifi was great!",5,2014,12,23
12,First class hotel / resturant,"We went to see Elton John in concert and we were very pleased with the wonderful decor of the hotel. Also the position where the hotel was situated. We had the most delicious lunch in the hotels Resturant, the food and service were first class, the Maitre d' was very professional. We only had one problem I put the wrong room number on the door for Breakfast! However the Desk Manger not only sorted out my problem and gave us the breakfast complimentary even though the mistake was mine.  We love to go back to the Crowne Plaza and also recommend the beautiful hotel",5,2014,12,19
12,Fantastic in Barcelona,"I booked this hotel after a lot of debate about which hotel I should choose in Barcelona. I discovered it between the IHG website and Tripadvisor.

I got a great deal and spent a fantastic few days in Barcelona with Crowne Plaza as my base.

A 5 minute walk from the Placa de Espanya Metro station, the hotel is located in a very convenient location.

They don't lie when they boast of the largest hotel rooms in Barcelona. Any larger than this, the rooms will have to be classified as Suites or Banquet halls.

Service is warm, the view is good, wifi is free.

Must highlight that the staff was very helpful and answered all queries.

The view from my room overlooking the school playground where little children played Football better than I ever will, will be a memory etched in my mind.

The hotel is close to La Ramblas, Mont Juic, Spanish Village, the old Roman Barcelona, Gran via, Camp Nou and a few metro stops from the Sagrada Familia. There are many restaurants and tapas bars nearby. Also, It took me just 25 minutes to the Airport.

While in Barcelona, I used the metro and walked a lot and it was great.

Of course no hotel is perfect. The hotel did have its share of plumbing and elevator maintainence down times on the last day. To their credit, they kept me informed about it in advance.

Let's just say I would stay there again and would happily recommend the Hotel to anyone who asked, or didn't ask.",5,2014,12,18
12,Prefect hotel and a great location.,"Have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona hotel. Cannot fault this hotel at all. Wonderful well appointed rooms with large comfy beds. Massive TV and big walk-in shower in the Bathroom. Excellent customer service. Just a couple of minutes walk to the musical Fountains. From there it's just a few minutes walk to the Metro Station, Olympic Village or the old Bull Ring shopping Arena with its great selection of restaurants on the top floor. Barcelona is a fantastic city to visit and explore. Glad we chose this hotel as there's certainly plenty to choose from. ",5,2014,12,18
12,You'll Enjoy It,"I had a pretty good experience at the hotel which sufficed my needs while I was there on leisure. In great proximity to the train station which was highly accessible to most parts of Barcelona and beyond. The surrounding area also had great attractions and awesome food options which we enjoyed exploring. 
Rooms were sizable with wonderfully comfortable beds. There's one thing about the Crowne Plaza brand which I embrace, and that's the little kit that helps you to sleep better, a Lavender pillow mist and aromatherapy oil for that relaxation feel. Room and amenities definitely met up to expectations. 
Drinks at the bar is rather pricey, so we did give that a miss. Other than that, am pretty sure it's a hotel you can take comfort and enjoy in.",4,2014,12,12
12,GREAT PRE OR POST CRUISE HOTEL,"We came in one day early for a back to back cruise, and, after our
experience at this Hotel, wish we had stayed for an extra two or three days.
Everything about this Hotel is excellent.  Here are some specifics to
exemplify what I am referencing.

     The Hotel is located in a semi-residential/ business area that
provides many opportunities within short walking distances.  Nearby the
Hotel are restaurants, small markets, and only two blocks or so is the City
Center which has many shopping opportunities. It is a little over halfway
between the airport and the Cruiseport.  The Hotel is centrally located for
most of what you would want to do in Barcelona, or it provides easy access
to transportation that will bring you to where you want to be.

     The rooms of the Hotel are sized fairly standard by European
standards, but are more than adequate to handle guests with large amounts
of cruise luggage.  The bedding, cleanliness, HVAC system operation, quiet
level, and bath are all excellent.  The bath, particularly, is exceptional.
We had a fabulous walk-in shower that we wish we could have taken with us.

     The staff of the Hotel are exceptional, and English is not a problem.  We
found all staff to be extremely helpful, and want to particularly note
Corina who checked us in.  After an all night flight that put us at the
Hotel at 7:00 Am, Corina checked us into out room early with no problem.  We
felt so blessed for that experience, and we badly needed a good place to
rest.

     For dinner that evening, we opted for sandwiches in the bar and
experienced very good food and great service.  The prices for our meal were
very much in line with what you would expect in a metropolitan Hotel.

   For cruisers, another important suggestion would be to use taxi service
to and from the Hotel.  Our taxi fare without gratuity from the Airport to
the Hotel was close to $25 E, while the fare from the Hotel to the
Cruiseport was under $15 E.  Since we had lots of luggage, a mini-van was
necessary, and this was not a problem.

     We are very thankful to all involved at the Hotel for making our one
night there so meaningful.  Next time, we will definitely spend more time
there before our cruise.",5,2014,12,10
12,Just OK,"Everything was just ok, nothing spectacular.

When arriving at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona – Fira Center the first thing I noticed was that there is no doorman or bell captain to assist with your luggage.  Ok, not a big deal with rolling luggage but I arrived in the rain with two rolling suitcases after an international flight and I noticed.

As with most flights from the US I arrived in BCN in the morning and was pleasantly surprised to find that my room was ready.    The gentleman who checked me in said that I had a very nice view but it was a view of a school sports area and a few interesting rooftops, certainly nothing to get excited about.  The room itself was quite large with a large, well-equipped bathroom.  There is a small entrance with a door that helps keep out noise from the hallway, this was greatly appreciated.  Along with complimentary coffee in the room there is also complimentary biscotti and bottled water, refreshed each day.

I normally avoid buffets but the breakfast buffet was good, it even included a nice cava.  Dinner was at the hotel one night and the service was good though the menu was a bit limited.  The hotel bar is a good place to meet friends before heading out.

The location is good, not particularly scenic but it is an easy walk to Placa D’Espagne and a short taxi ride to the many attractions in the city.  The taxi to and from the airport is approximately 30 euros and no other taxi ride, including Park Guell, was more than 15 euros.

One FUN thing they do - during the turn down service each night a packet of sheep shaped shortbread cookies are left on the pillow with a note about counting sheep.

One NOT FUN thing they do – as a platinum elite IHG guest I was surprised to find that unless you pay an additional 40 euros per day there is no access to an executive lounge.  The one hotel perk for being IHG platinum is a voucher for one treatment at the spa; I chose to spend my free time seeing Barcelona instead of in the spa.",3,2014,12,09
12,Business event,"We held a customer event with 200 people in this hotel. The event went flawless with good checkin and checkout preparation for all guests. The catering and breaks as well as all the attention provided by the staff was excellent. 
Rooms have all the amenities that you can expect. Clean rooms and good size shower. Easy Internet connection without any annoying access codes. 
I had a meal in the main restaurant - great service and reasonable prices. 
The hotel also has a spa which u fortunately even guests need to pay to access.",5,2014,12,09
12,Just a good stay,"This is a hotel which has been recently renovated to a good standard. It's well located for Montjuic and the Olympic stadium but a hike for the central area of Ramblas and Eixample. There are some good places to eat nearby including a restaurant by Ferran Adria which needs to be booked well in advance.
Staff are all very good but some are inexperienced. The girl checking me assured me my room was upgraded to a club room; the only thing was I had already booked a club room so that vaused confusion! it took about 1/2 hr to check in. There as absolutely no recognition of my platinum status and no extra amenities were offered in the room such as water. I mentioned this at check out and just got ""oh, sorry"". Not good enough I'm afraid.
Rooms are comfortable; only complaint was the same long hair was in the bath when I arrived and when I left so some attention to detail is needed.
Club lounge is very nice with tea/coffee/drinks/champagne available all day. Breakfast selection was fine although things were running out and not being replenished very quickly so quite a few empty plates were on the buffet. This is because the girl at the Club lounge reception desk also has to act as the waitress. Two things the hotel should focus on at breakfast- if pancakes/waffles are being offered, syrup should be available. And don't serve tinned mushrooms, use fresh ones!
Overall, a good experience but the small things make the difference and they were missing in this hotel. My recent experiences of Crown Plazas in Dubai and Doha have been much better.",4,2014,12,05
12,Much improved experience and definitely the management listens,"Had difficulty before checking-in with regards to acceptance of my frequent visitor status but Miguel responded and ensured that we get the Platinum treatment. Sven (front lobby), Bruno, Olga (Exec. lounge) took great care to make our wedding anniversary stay and memorable.We were greeted with champagne and sweets and upgraded to a suite. We were touched by Miguel's and staff's personal note.  On top of this all, we were provided complimentary use of SPA...fantastic facility.   The Executive Lounge is really high-class with Moet Champagne and top range drinks and finger food. The staff in the lounge actually works and personally serves each of the visitor - which was really a great gesture.",5,2014,12,04
12,Vey glad we chose this hotel,"Usually we stay at the Hilton Diagonal but decided to give this hotel a shot and it was definitely NOT a disappointment, in fact it was EXCELLENT! From the reservations and front-desk to the lounge and housekeeping staff, all were very friendly, welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Our special thanks to Sven the assistance manager who checked us in. Location was great, walking distance to public transportation, Plaza España, mall and restaurants. Room was huge (compared to many other branded hotels). Club lounge was relaxing, Nespresso coffee was a good choice and h'ourdvres in the evening was delicious. This hotel is now high on our list in Barcelona.",4,2014,12,02
12,Excellent choice in Barcelona!,The Hotel is completely new and has every comfort and service a great chain and crowne plaza offers around the word. The rooms are great and they offer you plenty of facilities and amenities such as nespresso coffe in the rooms with the machine and natural bath products directly produced from farmers from different countries. The food ( we had tapas for buffet lunch)was delicious and well served! This a great property to choose for both business or leisure as its just behind plaza de espanya!!,5,2014,11,25
12,Very pleasant stay.,"Perfect for business or leisure. Excellent size rooms and a very friendly and helpful Staff.. A good range of fine restaurants, shops e leisure places  all within walking distance. If needed, public transportation also very near by..",4,2014,11,23
12,"Good Hotel, great location","This was my 2nd visit to this hotel, but it was previously known as the Fira Palace. The check in was swift and friendly. We had a room with king size bed. The room was very clean and extremely quiet. No noise was heard from the corridor. The view from the 5th floor was not brilliant, but you could see the wonderful Museum of Art building in the morning light.

Breakfast was 18 euros per head. The usual things you would expect from a hotel of this standard. 

The bar was occasionaly very busy and extremely loud due to the amount of seminars held in the hotel. However, when it was quiet it was very nice and calming.
We had dinner in the hotel restaurant (el mall) one evening - and that was enough. We arrived in the dining room around 19:00. It was quiet with only two other tables occupied. I have no idea why, but we were rushed through the courses, and left the restaurant just before 20:00. The waiters seemed to be around us frequently to see if they could take away our plates. The wine was being continually poured from the bottle - even if we had not touched the glass since the previous re-filling - and was in danger of being finished before we had finished our starters.

I found it strange that the spa area was not free to hotel guests - especially the pool. They want 15 euros per person for entry.
To find the hotel can be challenging. As said at the top, it was previously known as Fira Palace. That is the name all the taxi drivers know. They generally do not know Crowne Plaza. Also the GPS for the car generally has the hotel as Fira Palace.

The location is great! It is less than 10 minutes walk to Place d'espagne (the old bull ring) where you will find a lot of restaurants which are open all day (after 11:00am). It is also a short walk to the ""magic fountain"" and the Museum of art. In the other direction you can walk down Avenue Parallel to the port, which takes around 15 to 20 minutes.

Despite my disappointment with the restaurant we will be coming back to this hotel. It really is very good.",5,2014,11,23
12,Great location clean room,"The rooms are clean and spacious with all the comforts for a business trip, the staff are helpful and it has a good location. The fitness was undergoing a refurb so I missed it. The breakfast was a bit basic and whilst the food from room service was good, the waiter was old school Spanish which was a shame otherwise a good night's rest",4,2014,11,20
12,Business trip to attend a conference,"The hotel was very clean, very large room with twin double beds and a huge flat screen TV on the wall. Bathroom was also huge with a large walk in shower and separate bath.

Public areas were spotless and all staff very friendly.

Restaurant in the hotel was also very good.

The only thing that let the hotel down was the location, it was a bit out of the way and there wasn't a great deal to do in the nearby vicinity.",4,2014,11,19
12,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel, with modern amenities.
Close to touristic attractions.
The hotel itself is modern, well maintained, with nice rooms, featuring large samsung smart tv screens, expresso machine...
Customer service is what sets the hotel apart, from the reception staff to the concierge and the housekeeping, everyone is helpful and willing to go the extra mile. ",5,2014,11,17
12,"Fantastic service, great hotel and superb location","I stayed here on business for a conference. The biggest standout staying at hotels with work a lot was the staff, they were amazingly friendly and helpful to everyone. This wasn't just reception staff, every member of staff I saw during my 4 night stay was so friendly and helpful to everyone.

The location of the hotel is superb, if you get the Aerobus from the airport you are about 5 minutes walk from the stop at Plaça d'Espanya. You are also on one of the main metro lines making getting around very easy.

The rooms were really clean, mini bar well stocked and free Nespresso coffee available in your room, like others I was not expecting the turn down service at all. The breakfast was equally impressive with a great choice which all appeared to be fresh.",4,2014,11,17
12,Beyond expectation ,"As a regular at intercontinental I opted to try Crowne Plaza on a recent weekend trip to Barcelona and was more than pleasantly surprised.

The service was impeccable. We were surprised to receive a turn-down which I did not expect in this brand and access to the executive lounge really made our weekend.

The spa has also been refurbished and was a great way to spend a few hours post checkout but prior to our rather late flight.

Thanks Crowne Plaza you made our weekend.
",5,2014,11,16
12,Friendly and Hospitable,"I stayed at this hotel because is close to RENFE station (maybe 1 mile), is surrounded by many restaurants and bars. You can also get the metro that can drive you all over the city (Station is 2 blocks away). The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable, the bathroom had a shower and a bathtub, hotel looks renovated it, and the staff is friendly and hospitable. The hotel has a buffet breakfast set up, all you can eat, it had a variety of food, vitamin C is very important for me. I’m definitely will be staying here again.",5,2014,11,15
12,Good service & great facilities,"Caters predominatelyfor business customers but then that usually means you get consistent service....high levels of comfort & a mahoosive TV which is just simply enormous....room comforts are good and room size is on the karge side of generous....staff service is professional without being too personal but then that is indicative of business orientated hotels. Overall a nice hotel with  good customer service and a surpringsly very good restaurant with knowledgable staff. Only a short walk to Metro & bus stops with taxis always outside the hotel so travel options are always close by.....special mention to front desk staff who were polite,efficient and friendly",4,2014,11,08
12,Excellent Stay,"The room I had needed to be seen to be believed.  It was huge with a 50 inch flat screen TV!

Room facilities are second to none with large bathroom boating both a shower and bath.  Coffee making facilities stretched to a Nespresso machine, although the pods were €2.60 each so take your own!

The building was clean with friendly staff from the reception to the hotel porters and cleaners.

Food at breakfast and lunchtime was plentiful and good.",5,2014,11,04
12,Good nights sleep,"Stayed in the crowne plaza in oct with family for 3 nights. One of the best hotels I've stayed in within Europe, the rooms are very big ( we had a twin room) decent size bathroom with separate clean modern shower- everything was well stocked and cleaned everyday. The room itself was extremely modern and spotless

We also had breakfast- decent range of food and well stocked, the usual for a European hotel. Staff was very friendly and welcoming, helped us out a few times with directions.

Negative slightly away from then centre but no more than 5-10 mins by the train from Espayna to Catalunya.

Overall a very good stay worth every penny! ",4,2014,11,02
12,Excellent Stay!,I stayed at the hotel last weekend with my girlfriend and I can only say that it was superb! Service was amazing from the first moment at reception throughout the whole stay. Rooms are huge and newly refurbished. They have also recently opened a beautiful new Spa which we used. I highly recommend this establishment if you want a wonderful stay in Barcelona.,5,2014,11,02
12,Outstanding - Perfect choice for Barcelona,"We used points for our stay, so we were unexpectedly surprised by the royal treatment we received. Everyone at the hotel welcomed us and went out of their way to ensure we had a spectacular stay. The hotel is new and we stayed in a gigantic room with a comfortable bed and a huge TV. The bathroom has a separate shower from the tub -- the shower water pressure was amazing. We took advantage of the club package which is an amazing deal and includes a full breakfast buffet. The hotel itself is in a quiet residential neighborhood very close to Plaza Espanya as well as the center of Albert Adria's collection of restaurants. We highly recommend Pakta which is right up the street from the hotel. We tried the spa too which was a great, relaxing way to spend the afternoon. Congratulations to Miguel Ángel for a well-run operation, and our special thanks to Elisa in the lounge for all her help.",5,2014,11,02
12,Typical business Hotel,"It's a typical business Hotel with the standards you would expect.

So there is nothing special or noticable about this Hotel.
It's clean, good beds, quiet and in a nice part of town.

Reception Staff is attentive.

So, pretty much your Standard business 4 Star",3,2014,10,31
12,"Great hotel, staff and service","I don't normally write reviews much but I had to about this hotel.  The hotel is great.  Very modern, great rooms, lovely new spa and amazing service from the staff.  I had a medical emergency whilst here and both the managers on reception, (I am sorry I don't remember your names) were extremely helpful and private with the matter.  They really went above and beyond to help me and it's a credit to the hotel.  Thank you.

Room is lovely.  Was upgraded to a suite which is stunning. Great fittings and lots of space.

The Spa - whilst amazing and new and modern what a bit tricky to use.  1. the staff do not speak english - which is fine as we are in spain but 2. You can't just go and use the pool and water circuit you have to book.  As an IHG platinum member I had a voucher for 3 days to use it free.  They didn't seem to understand the process that the voucher was for my entire stay and tried to take it off me each time.  No explanation or process explained which was frustrating. 3. When I went to use the gym the member of staff was on the phone clearly to another staff member or friend.  There was myself and another guest waiting and she just carried on her conversation and I was left there staring at the wall for 5 minutes.  Maybe it's the spanish way.... keep your customers waiting?

I can't recommend this place enough however for the rooms and front of house staff.

Thank you to the two managers in particular.",5,2014,10,30
12,Excellent service,"The large chain hotels are often let down by poor and lack of personal service.  This place was the exception to that rule.

First things first, the rooms were absolutely fantastic, clean, large, modern,etc.  The breakfast was also very good.  The free wifi in the room was very helpful (and unusual for most hotels)

Where they excelled though was with the little touches. My wife and I were staying with another couple in celebration off our 50th birthdays (me and the other guy were born on the same day!).  My wife had obviously mentioned it to them and they left lovely little touches in the room including sweet treats and a bottle of cava plus a hand written note from the staff. It just did not have the feel of a large chain hotel.   It made the whole weekend just so much nicer.  

The reception staff were very friendly and so well informed (and spoke excellent English - thank you). They recommended an excellent local tapas restaurant which was again a highlight

If you're looking for a quirky quaint hotel then this probably isn't the hotel for you but I thought it was absolutely fabulous.",5,2014,10,29
12,Fabulous base to explore a beautiful city,"This hotel is just brilliant. Very welcoming staff. Beautiful lobby area and really spacious bedrooms. We had a triple room with plenty of room which looked onto a local school. There were USB sockets to charge iPhones etc. the  hotel was quiet at night times which ensured we got a really good night's sleep after full days of sight seeing. I can't comment on breakfast as we ate out every day and did nit book breakfast. 

The hotel is a great location for the musical fountains which are only a five minute walk along the road. The fountain show only happens on a Sunday night apparently and is well worth watching - we loved it.
Not far ( around 10 minute walk) is an underground station Espanya. We used it regularly to explore the city; with a two or three day pass being more economical. The underground is easy to negotiate and very safe.  Further on from the underground station is a large shopping centre with lots of places to eat.",5,2014,10,28
12,Business Trip,"I stayed at the hotel for a business trip in october 2014, The hotel is centrally located and beautifully finished inside. The rooms are like brand new and mines came with a 50"" plasma at the bottom of the bed. I would certainly stay here and recommend anyone to. Buffet breakfast was excellent in the mornings as well with little or no queue.",5,2014,10,26
12,Excellent ,"I stayed at this hotel with my father in early October. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The suites were enormous and comfortable. The club lounge was wonderful and totally worth the extra $$ (food, drinks, priority check in). Now Pepa (the wonderful woman in the lounge) was exceptional- she greeted us with champagne and went on to help us with every detail of our trip (from airport transport to sight seeing). She was knowledgeable and patient and really made our stay at this hotel memorable. I have never felt compelled to review a hotel until now. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,24
12,Not bad,"Nice hotel, with comfortable beds and near the sea. But at the hotel they give you chrage equipment for mobile phone with money, and in the hotel for hotel syaers restaurant fee is not bad, almsot not bad hotel",5,2014,10,20
12,It's really worth it all,"It's one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at in Europe. It's luxurious very polished, everything in it big and spacious from the entrance to the flat TV, our stay was marvellous and very relaxing.

It's located at a close proximity from many tourist attractions, malls, restaurants and coffee shops; and it's not far from different local transportation. 

The staffs are very hospitable and welcoming, they didn't waste time orienting us of places and locations of must see Barcelona's attractions.

The room was clean and spacious, with two very comfortable queen size bed, sofa, comfy armchair, interactive flat TV, refrigerator, complimentary (water, coffee, tea, chocolate, biscuits and cake) I do appreciate the effort. The toilet was magnificent very beautiful and clean with separate shower and WC. 

There was a nice business center, with wireless printer; while the WiFi connection accessible and fast everywhere in the hotel.

I didn't use most of the hotel's amenities, yet I loved everything about it; definitely coming back, it's my first choice if I return to Barcelona, unless otherwise overbooked.

I recommend this hotel for newcomers, honeymooners, families and business. It's really worth it all.",5,2014,10,19
12,loved it!,"hotel looks and feel new, everything is in place. everything is clean.
we got a very big room, king size bed,  huge TV and even an espresso machine.
the room had lights for everything. free internet.
stuff were really nice and helpful. 
we got a really early check in and late checkout. without any problems.
the Hotel is located 2 min ( i timed it) to the magical fountain.  and 9 minutes walk to the Olympic park. 
 it is 7  minutes walk to/from plaza  Esapanya.  which is good for you if you arrive from the airport.   bus A1  from the airport has the first stop there.  and also have a metro station.
it's not not the center of the city , but it didn't bother us. awe didn't mind the 20 min walk to the La Rambla street,",5,2014,10,19
12,Great place to stay,"Big spacious rooms, very well defined and comfortable. 
Efficient reception staff. 
Wonderful amenities and Very close to the centre of activity and easily accessible from metro station.
 We got more than the money's worth.
Highly recommended.

",5,2014,10,18
12,Great business hotel,"I stayed at the crown plaza for 2 days during a workshop at Barcelona. The hotel caters for all the needs of a business stay. Very comfortable room, free internet and good location. It is a walking distance from the Arena and not too far from the center.
The food was not a strong point, but given that you are in Spain and you can simply find other restaurant outside the hotel within walking distance made this point not so important.
Overall, this was a good choice.",4,2014,10,17
12,Quality business hotel,"We stayed here over a 4 night period during a recent visit to Barcelona. On arrival we were upgraded to a larger room, due to my platinum IHG a status. This was nice. The room had a window we could open which meant we didn't have to use the air con. They have a restaurant on site which is quite nice, but a little overpriced. There are lot of other options in walking distance. Breakfast at €18/head is expensive. The room had a huge TV screen with over 40 channels, pity only about 5 local stations had any reception (reported this to the hotel on check out). The have no gym on site but use a 3rd party gym. The staff were pleasant and helpful.  The hotel is walking distance to many sightseeing opportunities, and the met. ",4,2014,10,16
12,excellent accommodation,"very well with the airport bus accessible (plaza Espana, the first stop)
4 metro stops to the center
a Bussines hotel, pleasant professional,
very large, comfortable rooms, peaceful courtyard (to the street side may be a bit louder)
We did not have breakfast because it seemed too expensive
the room service was not always perfect, not always consumed all things were replaced. All in all, just little things, otherwise we were very pleased and can highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,10,16
12,"Clean hotel, big rooms by European standards!","Loved this hotel for so many reasons! I have stayed in my fair share of European hotel rooms, some of which have been pretty tiny, but these rooms are very nicely sized, similar to what you'd find in a standard American hotel.  The hotel is extremely clean and modern, and they have nice amenities, including free WIFI access throughout the hotel (not just in the lobby).  They have a nice bar area, and lots of couches throughout the lobby.  Our bathroom was the biggest bathroom we've had in a European hotel -- it came with both a shower AND a tub, two person sink, toilet and a bidet.  The hotel itself is located just a short walk from the Placa Espanya station, which is a central hub for getting to different parts of town via the Metro.  This station is also the only train that gets you up to Montserrat.  You are a stone's throw away from Montjuic and the beautiful magic fountains, so every night when you are walking back to your hotel after dinner, you can stroll by the fountains to see the awesome show every night.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,10,16
12,Great hotel - great value,"It was my second stay in the hotel and it was a great experience again!
Rooms are very big, new modern furniture, huge Smart-TV and great bathroom!
WiFi in room/lobby and great breakfast buffett were included.
I am looking forward to my next stay!",5,2014,10,16
12,Comfortable and Convenient,"Reasonably priced, comfortable large room. Reasonably priced restaurant with good food, good meeting facilities and a friendly staff.  Great showers!

Terrific location - close to a metro station that allows you to go most places in the city without changing lines, walking distance to the fountain light show and art museum, close to Pablo L'espanyol and other scenic sights including Montjuic castle and the olympic stadium.  Quiet at night unlike hotels closer to Las Ramblas",4,2014,10,13
12,Fantastico!,"This hotel was one of the best hotels that my wife and I have stayed during our numerous vacations in Europe. Rooms are spacious, modern, clean, and comfortable with a large TV. The staff are extra nice and helpful. Pepa is the name of a very nice and professional lady in the front desk who welcomed us at our arrival and helped us to plan our trips to several tourists attractions in her magisterial city like we were her friends. Now, we know that if we get lucky again and get a chance to visit Barcelona, where we will stay. Crowne Plaza Barcelona and its exceptional staff made our visit to this beautiful city a memorable one.",5,2014,10,11
12,Comfortable,"Was very comfortable, large room, large bed and large TV. We booked it via Expedia and got a good rate. The location was good near the magic fountains, 10 minutes walk from Pl Espanya got metro and airport bus. However we made a mistake of ordering drinks in the bar. €28 for two G&T was huge and for Beefeater at that! ",3,2014,10,09
12,Tip top,"One of the best hotels I have stay in for the price. Big modern room, fantastic views, beautiful spa, free WiFi and one of the best breakfasts you'll find in a hotel anywhere (even at triple the price).",5,2014,10,09
12,INCREDIBLE HOTEL,The room was very comfortable and extremely modern. We arrived early and the front desk staff was very accommodating in letting us check in early. We only had to wait 30 minutes. Hotel is in a great location close to the Olympic Venues and the MNAC. Also close to transit to get to other desired parts of the city,5,2014,10,06
12,Bliss,"We were on our way home via flying back to Paris and air France was on strike, so we were stuck in Barcelona for an extra night. Of course our apartment time was up so we were scrambling to find reasonable priced accomodation for one day. Loved the room we had, the staff were friendly and efficent can't fault it...it was bliss!",5,2014,10,06
12,"Nice hotel, but, too remote and understaffed","The hotel is rather new and is quite attractive.  The rooms are large and the hotel is pleasant.

However, based on my recent stay, the above favorable comments are about the only substantive things I can say about the Crown Plaza, Barcelona.

The hotel is a bit isolated in that it is located in a predominately residential area.

Finding restaurants and shops near the hotel is difficult. Foot traffic around the hotel for guests is at a minimum. Walking to the Metro requires walking through a somewhat deserted area.  At night this is not a comfortable feeling.

One item that stood out at the hotel was the lack of a steam iron for guests to use.  It has been my experience that all major chain hotels offer a steam iron in a guest room.  Not so at Crown Plaza, Barcelona  There was an iron but it was not a steam iron and worse, the ironing plate was covered with baked on and burned on soil from prior use of other guests.  The few dollars saved by the hotel for buying cheap irons detracts from the nice overall appearance of the hotel. 

Crown Plaza is part of the IHG hotel chain.  The chain boasts about several special benefits given to their elite members.  I hold the highest tier (Platinum) and the benefits offered to IHG Platinum members are near nothing compared to the benefits offered to high tier elites at most other major hotel chains.   

One listed ""benefit"" for elites at IHG is where the chain boasts that Platinum members have  ""priority check in.""  The problem with that promise is if there is a line at check in and there is only one person working the desk, how does the priority check in work?  Quite simple - it doesn't.

The hotel seemed to be understaffed.  On the few occasions I needed questions asked, I could not get reception to answer the guest telephone.  I eventually went down to reception only to find one person working the front desk and unavailable to answer my question (too busy helping other customers or on long telephone calls). 

Bottom line?  This hotel has a lot of potentially good amenities.  However, more employees are needed.  The remote location of the hotel is the main drawback of the hotel unless a guest is content taking taxis everywhere or not venturing out of the hotel during the stay.  

Despite the negative things I expressed, my stay was reasonably pleasant and I would return to the hotel again.",3,2014,10,05
12,great location and service,"Superior 4* hotel in a great location. My friend is a IHG card holder so we were upgraded to a nice room on the 5th floor. We didnt use the Metro but there was a taxi rank right outside the hotel or bus stop was a short walk away.
The room had two double beds, a leather recliner chair, huge flat screen Smart TV and a spacious bathroom with a tub and separate shower. It was really lovely to have so much space.
We took advantage on having breakfast at the hotel the following morning. 20EUR pp which i thought was excessive. the only hot items were eggs and bacon- no potatos, sausages or beans. they also had cereal or pastries.
Would definately stay again but wouldnt bother with the breakfast.",5,2014,10,04
12,Perfect!,"This is our second experience in an IHG hotel group and it was, again, a great experience. 
We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the stay from A to Z.
The hotel was perfectly situated closed to the underground station Espanya.
The room was spacious with a giant TV screen and an impeccable cleanliness. We had amenities every day (bottle of water, chocolate).
The restaurant served typical Spanish meals. The breakfast buffet was also amazing with a lot of choices between sweet and salt.
We will definitely come back.",5,2014,10,02
12,Unexpected Pleasure,"Booked this hotel for a two-day stay at the end of a three-week trip to Barcelona and France. Had a wonderful stay at the Catalonia Catedral Hotel before but wanted to spend less and be at another place in the city. We walked into a huge room that could hold a family that had luxurious appointments, a huge bathroom, great wifi, and was in walking distance of MNAC and some good restaurants. Next time in Barca with these rates I stay here.",4,2014,10,01
12,Quality hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for a week on business. 
Was a bit out of the way for me and quite a walk to central locations but on the whole a high quality hotel. Rooms big and modern. Food good quality. Shame the place had no gym and you need to use one nearby. Short walk to metro station. Overall good",4,2014,09,30
12,Excellent stay!,"We have just had a super stay in this hotel! Thanks to my husband's IHG gold elite card they have upgraded us to a executive room and we were not even paying for the stay as he was redeeming some points available! In most of the hotels, they give you the worst rooms once you go free! Really appreciated!

Regarding the stay, I have to mention the super mattress and the pillows of Crowne Plaza hotels once again. The complimentary lavender sprays they leave by your bed is also a nice detail to remember from your stay. Thanks a lot!

By the way it is a business hotel and it is really close to the heart of Barcelona.",5,2014,09,30
12,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed for 5 nights in September 2014.  The hotel is lovely, nice and quiet.  Attentive and pleasant staff.

We paid for lounge access and used it a lot; for breakfast, drinks and snacks when we returned from sightseeing and for drinks before we went out in the evening.  for 20 Euros a head we felt it was good value.

There is nothing we could fault about our stay.  Beds were large and comfortable, everywhere was spotlessly clean.  it's in a good location.  

We would recommend it.",5,2014,09,30
12,Amazing - Crowne Plaza Barcelona,"We stayed here for 1 night before a cruise.  As a large family group we stayed in 4 suites.  Our stay was perfect in every way and in fact exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we walked into the hotel the service we received was truly outstanding.  Joanna from the Club Lounge was amazing and so very helpful, always looking after us and especially tending to the needs of the babies/children in our group.  Every suite was beautiful, spacious rooms, lounge, TV's, bathrooms and balcony's and the food was delicious.  Just 20 mins walk to La Ramblas or a few euros in a cab.  This is first class, high quality, brilliant hotel, with fantastic staff.  This hotel is well managed in every sense and a wonderful place to stay.  We will be back!  Thank you.",5,2014,09,28
12,Great hotel but near concert venue,"A classic upmarket business type hotel, rooms good quality and spacious. Only downside is that it is close to an outdoor concert venue, which means when there are concerts, you can hear them in your room. With a concert finish time of 1 am not ideal.",4,2014,09,24
12,Great Personal Service.,"We stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the personalized service we received throughout this hotel.  General Manager, Enrique, and Olga from the Club Lounge were friendly and very helpful with advise regarding things to do and restaurants to visit. This hotel is close to numerous attractions and has a taxi stand directly outside so transport was always available. We will definitely stay here on future visits.",4,2014,09,22
12,Wonderful stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona,We stayed here for 4 nights and had an excellent time. The location is perfect for a short walk to the subway and a few minutes from the Museu Nacion d'Art. The room was spacious and comfortable. We ordered room service on the second night and the food was filling and delicious and the bar downstairs was relaxing and well priced. Next time I am in Barcelona I'll probably rest my head on their comfortable beds again.,5,2014,09,19
12,THIEFS AROUND THE LOBBY AND NO SECURITY. AVOID THIS PLACE!,"Business Traveller.
The hotel has no SECURITY. 
Thiefs are around the lobby while the clients are relaxing in the lobby! 
They stolen our bag, money, passport, credit cards.
HOTEL MANAGER IS USELESS.
AVOID THIS PLACE.
Instead to make business there we were popping up Consulate, Police and international phone calls.
Thanks for the wonderful experince we had tha Crowne Plaza Barcelona!",1,2014,09,15
12,"Modern, comfortable hotel with high standards","We stayed here at the end of March 2014 for a weekend trip. At the time, the hotel was quite new. The hotel is just a short 10 min walk to either Placa Espanya or Poble Sec metro stations. The airport bus service into town (The A1 Aerobus) from Terminal 1 stops conveniently at Placa Espanya.

The English speaking hotel reception staff were very helpful and friendly and helped to orient us on the map upon arrival. Although we arrived quite early, we were able to check-in and settle into our room before the standard check-in time, enabling us to get some rest before seeing the city.

Our room was large, spacious & clean with a very cosy and comfortable king size bed. The fittings were of a high standard and the TV was enormous.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,11
12,Convenient ,"Located in a residential neighbourhood it's a typical chain hotel where things work according to plan but still lacks some soul. Nonetheless the rooms are comfortable and spacious, staff is nice and helpful and there is a metro stop ten minutes walking. Twenty minutes walking and you'll be at the end of Las Ramblas. No interesting restaurants around. Gym was no working but you can access a gym located at walking distance (2 minutes). Breakfast could be more varied. All in all you'll fell comfortable. ",4,2014,09,08
12,Clean and nonchalant,This hotel is tucked in behind the Fira Center in Barcelona. It is about a 5-10 minute walk from the Pl. España metro station. It was clean and very classy. They did recognize IHG members and treated were very helpful work local directions. ,5,2014,09,07
12,Nice hotel,"We stayed here two nights in July and the hotel was very good.We had a few issues while checking in ,but the staff was very helpful and showed good cutomer service -The rooms are huge and nice decorated.The breakfast was ok,we got it included,I probably wouldn't have payed for it.
The hotel bar is excellent and wifi is fast",4,2014,09,07
12,Great hotel,"Spent 4 nights in this great hotel. 
Though being out of the centre, it's within walking distance of the Magic fountains and in proximity of public transport at Placa Espanya. There is also a taxistop in front of the hotel.

The staff of the hotel was very kind and helpful at all times.

My friend and I were both upgraded to a club room with club lounge access. 
The rooms were very spacious and comfortable, with excellent beds and a very nice bathroom. I also loved the multimedia interfaces for the SmartTV.

The club lounge is very welcoming. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning and the tapas and drinks in the late afternoon. Very nice & friendly service.

Too bad the new SPA was not open yet.
This hotel met all my expectations and I will gladly stay there again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,09,03
12,Nice hotel at a convenient location,"This is not a grand, flashy, hotel, but the decor is very tasteful, and the room is clean. It is conveniently located - the harbor, Montjuic, the Olympic Stadium, the old palace (The Magic Fountain - Thursday to Sunday), the Botanic Garden, are all within comfortable walking distance.

The staff is wonderful, especially the manager, Miguel. Friendly and helpful. The free in-room WiFi is a bonus. Will definitely stay here again - only 20 minutes to the airport by taxi.",4,2014,09,02
12,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for a four day family trip to see Barcelona. Staff helpful and informative.Rooms large and clean.
We didn't have food in the hotel as we ate out.
Located close to Montjuic and the Magic Fountains which are highly recommended.Short bus/metro ride into main part of Barcelona.",5,2014,09,02
12,Barcelona business trip,"Arrived much earlier than scheduled to a friendly receptionist who checked us in without hesitation and gave us an excellent room. Very clean and well appointed hotel in a good location, with  very helpful staff.",4,2014,09,01
12,Great hotel very comfortable stay.,"We booked 4 days at the Crowe plaza in Barcelona. It is wonderful hotel with very nice big rooms that have been recently refurbished. 

The service was also very good and staff were extremely pleasant. We had a slight mishap where there was a leak in our bathroom but the staff responded immediately and upgrading us to a suite for the rest of our stay. 

The location is not in the city centre but not far from most attractions, with the Espanya tube station only a 5 min walk from the hotel.  

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to other travellers. 

Cheers

12,family stay,"beautiful hotel, nice ambiance, convenient location and helpful staff.
loved it :)  There is shopping mall located nearby, walkable to musical fountain and also the metrop stop. There are good places to eat nearby.",4,2014,08,31
12,Highly to recommend - really excited about this place,"I travel a lot for Business, being bound to chain hotels and travel policies, and although I cannot really complain, this hotel was a very pleasant exception for a long time:

- Rooms are clean and spacious
- Bathrooms are excellent, with German fittings, separate Toilet, Shower and Bathtub
- Bathroom Amenities are well selected and generous
- Coffee Station is excellent (!) - Nespresso in 3 choices, instant coffee, coacoa, several teas, chocolate, biscotti
- Well equipped minibar
- Free and speedy Wifi
- USB Charger, HDMI Connection, huge Samsung Screen
and many more well appointed details

The killer is the lounge which you get with either an Executive Room or for a minimal surcharge of 40 EUR:

- excellent Buffet Breakfast
- ample selection of Drinks and Spirits, including unlimited Moet and Chandon
- very tasteful snacks 

A real find in an excellent location in Barcelona - if you have every trusted my reviews, then book this place now!",5,2014,08,30
12,Great Hotel,"This hotel is great and we would book again if going to Barcelona. It's close enough to the main attractions to be convenient but far enough from the crowds to be peaceful and quiet. It's easy to get to further  locations on public transit ( a few mins walk away). The Hop On, Hop Off bus is also a short walk away. The Magic Fountain and shopping center are within walking distance. 
The rooms are modern, very comfortable with free wifi and bathrooms are spacious and clean. There is a second door at the entrance to block sounds from the corridor but we didn't need to use it. There is a restaurant downstairs which we did not eat at. Nearby there were some local cafes. Casa de Tapes served the most delicious tapas. Staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly.

",5,2014,08,30
12,My second home 💛,"What can I say this hotel is just amazing from the decor right down to food. Best hotel room I've ever stayed in with the best facilities. Such pleasant and kind staff. Right around the corner from the montejunic fountains and a short bus ride away from the beach. I love barcelona anyway because of how easy it is to get around by train, bus or even by foot and and also because of the culture and beautiful city that it is. I feel so relaxed and at ease whenever I come it's like a home away from home and this hotel just makes it even better. Stayed with my boyfriend for 5 nights on an employees staff rate so it was excellent value for money we both thoroughly enjoyed it and I will  definitely be returning in 2015! Thank you CP Barcelonaaaaaaa x",5,2014,08,28
12,Amazing!,"We stayed here for one night and absolutely loved it! We got the train from Salou and then walked from the train station, it took about 20-30 min but there are also plenty of taxis & the Metro.

The room was fantastic, my current favourite. It was very spacious and modern with a huge TV and bathroom as well as plenty of USB ports and plugs. The view wasn't great, just a view of nearby apartments & the local gym. On a side note, the hotel gym is currently been renovated but the hotel provide access to one that is just around the corner.

In the bathroom, there was a separate shower cubicle and bath with a range of products to use. There are plenty of towels and two XXL dressing gowns. The bath filled up very quickly and was heavenly to have a soak in after a long day. 

The beds aren't too big but are very comfy and clean with no nearby noise disturbances. Limited tea, coffee, milk, biscuit supplies are provided as well as a mini bar stocking chocolate, alcohol and other refreshments. 

We didn't eat at the hotel but noticed a restaurant on the Reception floor and the hotel provided a excellent breakfast service. There was a menu door hanger which allowed you choose from the many breakfast options and select which time you would like it delivering to your room for a small price.

If returning to Barcelona, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,27
12,"Convenient location, spacious rooms, housekeeping could be improved","We stayed for 4 nights and was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel in an excellent, easy to find area. We did request a nice view room but ended up with a view of apartments opposite. The room was great, spacious with a huge t.v and big bathroom. The double beds are not average size, be aware and didn't give us much turning room however we slept comfortably with no noise disturbance from outside or inside, in fact we often thought we were the only one's in the hotel. Limited tea, coffee and milk supplies but a good working fridge which we used to store our water bottle in ( shop over the road sold water rather cheap). We didn't eat at the hotel and found a cafe within 5 minutes walk which was reasonable and catered for vegetarians. We had to ask every night for additional towels, we sometimes were left none and sometimes 2 (there were 3 staying in the room) this could be annoying if your back late and want a quick shower before bed. On the last night of our stay we arrived back to the room around 11pm and were shocked to find wet towels draped all over the floor from the door into the bedroom, we asked at reception what had happened to then be told our room had flooded whilst we were out and they had forgotten to remove the towels. Needless to say we waited for housekeeping to arrive and remove them, leaving a wet carpet and wet clothes that had been left on the floor when we went out. Staff at reception told us we had to wait until the morning to speak to someone about this. Although the staff in the morning were very apologetic it was abit late to be offered use of their laundry facilities free of charge as we leaving for our flight home. It was a shame this happened as the rest of our stay was very pleasant and would book again if I ever returned.",4,2014,08,26
12,lovely hotel but ........,"booked to stay here for 2 nights as a family of four - we booked our stay through a third party broker ( to get the best deal) - we originally requested a family room to accommodate all 4 guests, we also rang the hotel few days prior to our stay to confirm the booking and to request that we have either a family room or at least an interconnecting room so we could be with our children. We arrived from the airport quite late at night to check in and upon arrival we found ourselves standing for approx 20 mins whilst the receptionist tried her best to accommodate our request. Unfortunately, after a while we were informed that there was no interconnecting rooms or indeed 2 rooms next to each other. The closest rooms we were offered was 1 room on the 1st floor and our 2nd room on the 5th floor !!! - We weren't pleased but wasn't in a position to argue or negotiate as we was tired and just wanted to get into the rooms. We were offered a VIP upgrade to the club lounge on the first night but unfortunately by the time we had taken our suitcases to both rooms the VIP club lounge was closed !!!! The next morning we moved out of the 2 rooms and was moved to different rooms and this time they were next door to each other. we tried to use the VIP lounge on the 2nd night but the new rooms cards we were given didn't work and therefore we could not gain entry to this exclusive lounge !! Overall, although the mix up with the rooms were a nuisance and an inconvenience, the hotel is very nice, clean.The breakfast was ok but not the biggest choice, the bacon was streaky bacon and very greasy and the sausages were chipolatas cooked in onions ( like hot dogs sausages) Didn't opt for any meals in the restaurant but used the bar area which is very relaxing and quiet. Overall the hotel is of a very high standard with nice bathrooms and I would certainly stay here again despite the mix up with the rooms",4,2014,08,26
12,"Spacious, comfortable and convenient location","We stayed in this hotel for a short 3 day break to Barcelona.  5-10 minutes walk from the metro it is well placed for flying in and using public transport.  This is a good standard hotel with plenty of space and excellent service.  The room was very nice with a massive LED tv and comfortable chairs.  Beds very comfortable and a very nice bathroom that was spacious and modern.  We had two large double beds in the room.
We used the RENFE train network to get from the airport to the city (20 minutes) and could use one of our T10 tickets for this journey and the other remaining tickets around the city.  We liked the old town best with its only narrow streets and the area around the hotel was very nice.",5,2014,08,25
12,Pleasant hotel with the exception of the food,"We arrived at the hotel mid morning, after an early flight out from the UK & were delighted that after a short wait we were able to access our rooms.  These were on the 8th floor with a view across the roof tops to the Sagrada Familia & the cable car.  Very clean rooms with for once, efficient, quiet, air conditioning.  There was also English TV channels, free wifi, complimentary shampoo, shower gel etc. Chairs in the room were very comfortable, as were the huge beds! The tea/coffee facilities in the room could have been better - just one large cup & one very small cup provided (our son's room only had one cup throughout our stay despite requesting a second); plenty of tea & coffee sachets but only two small milk portions!  We also only had one small bottle of water in the room for two people.  The breakfast was expensive for what it was.  The 'hot' food the hot plate was barely warm.  I opted for the croissants which just tasted of oil & so didn't bother with breakfast for the rest of our stay. The buffet style evening meal was also only warm, despite us being in the restaurant within 10 minutes of it opening.  Needless to say we only ate there on the first night.  Also, like other reviewers, we were disappointed to find on arrival that the pool was still shut for refurbishment.  Despite my gripes I would probably stay again as the location was great - just a short walk from the Magic Fountain & the sightseeing bus stop was just a 10 minute walk up the road & the accommodation a good price. However, next time all meals will be eaten out!",3,2014,08,23
12,Great Hotel,"Just got back from Barcelona and stayed at this great hotel. I'd definitely recommend and would stay there again. Breakfast is great, free wifi across the whole hotel, free computers to use for all, good sized rooms/bathroom, friendly and helpful staff and good size TV in the room. 4 of us staying in one room, I rearranged the furniture a bit to give us more space; with the room being so big, the kids on the other side of the room felt like they were far away which is great!

Location was great too; 10mins from Espanya station to Line3, which was one of the main lines we used to get around the city and not far from city centre.

I've given it four stars as the cleaning staff would sporadically forget to top up on items in the room, the air con was a bit too weak, the four bed rooms had three quarter beds (not double) and I feel a hotel of this calibre could do with a few extra little touches like drinks in the foyer.

Would I stay here again? Defo.",4,2014,08,20
12,Great hotel ,"It is one of the most amaZing hotel with one of the biggest standard rooms which I have ever seen... They have the best of amenities in the room.. They have a 42 inches LED in the room, biggest I have ever seen in a hotel.  Kudos to the owners for making such a fine property.. The location is not city centre, but it is not bad either...

The staff especially the porter was extremely helpful. The breakfast staff was very cordial.. All in all, I would only stay in this hotel, whenever in Barcelona.. ",5,2014,08,19
12,Very convenient for drivers,"We choose this hotel mainly for its underground garage, but we found out that many of the places, like Mount Juidic and the ""dancing fountains"" were within a walking distance. There are also many good restaurants and Tapas Bars within a few steps. The hotel itself is spacious and elegant. As Gold Elite members we were upgraded for free to an executive room with view, which was in perfect order, very large and convenient. The free wifi is a big bonus. The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfasts are generous and lovely. We had once nice toasts at the bar and once a bufet dinner at the hotel restaurants - both were very satisfactory. Very much recommended.",5,2014,08,18
12,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel where we were very well looked after. The room was very large for a city location with all of the facilities that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We upgraded to the Club Lounge and found the facilities superb, providing an excellent breakfast and snacks throughout the day. Sandra and her team in Reception provided us with every request we made and we cannot praise her highly enough for her excellent level of service. We would most certainly return to the Crown Plaza on our next visit and strongly recommend a stay in this location.",5,2014,08,16
12,Average and impersonal,"Your average Crowne Plaza Hotel. There was a line at check-in with the process seeming to take well above average for each guest. As they do not have a separate concierge area, guests would inquire about what to do in Barcelona also at the reception. There certainly was no sense of urgency when it came to acknowledging waiting guests. Check in itself was standard- neither friendly nor otherwise- mostly uninterested- not genuine. One bellboy was available, who again was  not that interested in anything and was reacting to guests requests, rather then being proactive. The general feeling I got was that the hotel was grossly understaffed, undertrained- I guess the staff were inherited from the previous hotel (Fira Palace) and had yet to understand the IHG culture. 
Room- clean, and with all the amenities expected from a 4 star hotel. AC worked well. Double door to the hallway ensures that noise does not travel from that direction. Housekeeping was erratic- every single day one item would be forgotten. On one day, both hand towels were not delivered. Bed sheets are not changed daily even if dirty- again lack of training, consistency and common sense.
Breakfast- service was again unfriendly and mechanical. The breakfast buffet selection was adequate for a four star hotel. 
Check-out. Bill was correct. They are saving costs by not printing the initial bill for verification, thus the computer is turned around for all guests waiting in line to see your bill. 
Overall- it was a very average stay and I would only consider staying here again depending on the price. They showed no interest in me, thus there is no need to show any loyalty to IHG even as a Platinum Rewards Club member.",3,2014,08,16
12,Excellent place to stay close to the fountains,"Really nice hotel, situated closely to the fountains and only a few minutes walk from the bus stop.  Takes about 20 minutes to get into the centre of Barcelona on foot, but an interesting walk.

Our room was upgraded and was excellent with really comfortable beds and a bathroom to die for!

Everything was very clean and staff were very helpful.
My only complaint is that the outside space was closed which was a bit of a blow in this hot weather.",4,2014,08,15
12,Almost all good,"I was rather put off to begin with when I arrived at the hotel, asked for assistance with my luggage and was ignored by the front desk staff and supervisor (who then went on a wander around the lobby). On the positive side, when the front desk did turn their attention to me, it was a very positive check-in and a nice highlighting of my status benefits. I would rate the room highly as large, well-appointed, in excellent condition and meeting all expectations. I'll also complement the front desk on handling the extension of my visit well and checking me out perfectly. Really only one glitch in my entire stay. The location is good for those who need to be near Fira, but a little fair from many of the typical tourist attractions if on leisure. Metro is a short walk away, so convenient. I do think it's an unwise practice for the hotel wifi to be unsecure.",4,2014,08,12
12,Best Place to stay,"Very clean and luxury Hotel,good breakfast but I suggest to put Tomato on Table.
You can access to beach by bus in 10 minute and 10 minute also by Bus to catalunya Sq.Also Main train station for travelling to other spain Cities are near.
The problem is you should walk 10 minutes to access the bus stations and then you reach all.
Shopping Mall Arena is very close and Airport Bus is on Espanya Sq.the atmospher is Warm and staff are very helpful and warm and answer you in best way.
i like to stay here although it s far from the Catalunya Sq.because it s good to be a little far from Crowded Streets.",5,2014,08,12
12,Very Good Rooms & Location,"We loved our stay in this hotel ! Breakfast buffet was quite nice so were the room service foods ! The rooms were well maintained & are of good size ! Only thing they need to improve is on hyr attending to guest calls on queries ... The response time was very slow ! The phone would keep ringing & then when picked up the staff is not very well informed :( 
Overall great place to stay ",4,2014,08,12
12,Really good hotel,"Great hotel very clean with big rooms, my only gripe was the travel to las rambles and other sights around Barcelona! Having said that it is such a big place that you probably couldn't get central for all of the sights. Very near to magic fountains, Olympic village, montjuic and placa de espanya.",5,2014,08,09
12,not very good,"It started off badly when hotel took no notice of my husband's special request for my birthday treat, he asked for high floor we were put on ground floor with next doors air conditioning unit rattling away outside, so requested a move which they did within the hour were given room on third floor good sized room clean and tidy .
Breakfast next morning was cold , went out for a days sight seeing came back for siesta before going out for a nice birthday meal, room had not been touched so can you imagine how embarrassing it was to be awoken with someone trying to get in our room ,just glad we had put the chain on , reception had booked someone else in our room,they were equally embarrassed with the situation,my husband went down to speak to the duty manager who was very apologetic offered to move us but a third move not a chance,he was told very sorry we didn't listen to your request and realise it was your wife's birthday we will do something special in your room for when you return and book you into the restaurant tomorrow for a special free meal to apologize for the upset, so out we went for a lovely meal came back wait for it nothing !!just the bed made.
Next morning breakfast looked better but still cold ,went out sight seeing again got back to shower and clean up ready for my special meal , imagine my horror to be told it's a buffet help yourself well after short conversation we went out for another lovely meal out ,not very pleased with the hotel ,came back to an apologetic note off management bottle of cava and some petite fours very nice but by this stage we had had enough ,next morning had toast gave up expecting hot breakfast checked out ,Barcelona we loved the city and will return but not to this hotel , as I've read business hotel and agree ,oh plus only one small bottle of water for a three nights stay one tea cup,one coffee cup a total joke we told reception it was set up for one person but nothing changed ,very disappointed crowne plaza must try harder.",3,2014,08,09
12,Nice hotel a bit unfriendly staff,"Enjoyed the bed, bedding and breakfast. Bathroom large, clean and new. Breakfast has many options and was very nice. Restaurant in hotel was excellent! Staff not helpful or excited about helping tourists find sights. They were helpful (although not friendly) in providing adaptor and other things I forgot to pack. ",4,2014,08,09
12,Just ok ,"We stayed here recently and the hotel was very clean and nice, I stayed in one of the deluxe rooms so if you do so they offer a free breakfast buffet, which was very good and they also offer you snacks and free drinks throughout the day too!! I have to say though the A/C in the building is terrible, even in your room, I was uncomfortable and hot throughout my stay here, I'm glad it was for only one night, besides that and the dinner buffet they offer in the lobby restaurant that I paid for was not very good at all. Everything else was fine and it is a short walk to the magic fountains, which was great! ",3,2014,08,08
12,Well-appointed although a little impersonal,"Very much a business hotel so somewhat impersonal, but excellently equipped. Rooms are substantial with huge TV, plenty of storage and good bathroom with separate shower and bath and decent array of fairtrade toiletries. Breakfasts are no more, and no less, than expected of a chain hotel of this standard.  Level of soundproofing in the rooms is sub standard however. Great free entertainment every night at the Font Magica five minutes walk away and the miles of beaches of Barceloneta are easily accessible by the D20 bus down Avenida Parallel: bit slower than the Metro but takes you right to the beach.",4,2014,08,05
12,Exceeding my expectations,"I stayed there for 5 nights in July. It was my first visit to Spain so I didn't know what to expect. But what I have experienced with this hotel was truly exceeding my expectations. 

First of all, the lobby is HUGE (both in breath, depth and height) and with many comfortable chairs and tasteful decor. Everything is shiny and new, with fancy lighting (natural and manmade), creating a true 5-star feel. It is excellent to hold a conference there as people will have plenty of space to sit and chat with each other. 

Second, the room is very spacious. I had a queen-size bed, a very long curved desk (enough to have two people sit side-by-side), and two large single-person sofas with a coffee table, and a magazine table. The decor and furniture are modern, simple (straight lines), and pleasing to the eye. 

Third, the bathroom is very bright and large, with a tub and a separate shower. It has a toilet and a bidet, in a separate compartment enclosed with frosted glass doors. The shower has a removable hosed shower head as well as a ceiling mounted shower head.   

It has a few other nice extras: daily free snacks (chocolates and biscotties), a safe that is large enough to put my 15"" Mac Book Pro in, and nice bathrobes and soft slippers. It has a small coffee maker (I think it might make expressos too, but I never used it) and a electric pot for heating water. I like this because unlike in other hotels, my tea can finally taste like tea and not like coffee. 

Finally the location is superb. It's about 8-10 min walk from Pl. Espanya. I took A1 bus (5.90 euros one way) from airport and got to Pl. Espanya in one stop (about 20 minutes) and then walked to the hotel. It was a nice walk too -- you can marvel at all the grand architectural structures around you. Pl. Espanya is a big transport hub, linking buses, metros and trains in Barcelona, so getting anywhere using public transportation is very convenient! The A1 bus comes every 5 minutes or so most of the time during the day. 

The hotel is also convenient located at the foot of a few charming gardens (Jardines du Laribal, etc.) so very convenient if you want to have a walk or jog in the park. 

From the hotel, you can also walk to a few museums and theatres, including Teatre Lliure and Teatre Grec, the open-area theatre that is most charming. I went to a Jazz/Flamenco concert at the Teatre Grec and was absolutely enchanted. 

The hotel's restaurant opens until 11pm, but after that, you can try out the small restaurant right next door to the hotel. It's nothing to write home about, but it is also reasonably priced. I think it opens all night...

The only complaint I have is the sound isolation of the hotel room could be improved a bit. It's located on a quiet street, so no street noise, but I can hear people talking in the hall way very clearly. 

Overall, it was a wonderful and convenient hotel. Try look for deals for this hotel. (I got a great deal from Hotwire.)",5,2014,08,04
12,"Beautiful and large size room, great Location!","We stayed at the Crown Plaza Fira Center from July 29 / August 1st. We were very pleased with the location, very close to Plaza España. The lobby smells so nice.  Kamel in the lobby area was very friendly and gave us a lots of wonderful tips. Front desk staff very friendly as well. The room was huge and very clean, nicely decorated. Breakfast was outstanding, they serve mimosas every morning. Will highly recommend it!",5,2014,08,04
12,"Standard, good standard","Very good location, easy reach from the airport. Lot of things to look at are in walking distance. The best idea is to take a short walk and to rent a bicycle for further sightseeing.
Got Club Room what includes Club Lounge services. Snacks, drinks, etc. included.
A russian speaking lady Olga B. was very helpful with restaurant recommendations, car rental and general advice. Overall, good place to stay.",5,2014,08,03
12,Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center,"We were upgraded to club class.  Excellent facilities spoiled only slightly by building site next door and intermittent wifi.  New fitness suite being built - drilling & hammering did not begin until 8am and finished before we returned to our rooms later in the day.
Service excellent: always English speakers available who were very happy to help.  Food excellent.  Quality of surroundings excellent. Location very good for MNAC, Olympic Park, Fira Center and Montjuich Park.  Metro 10 minutes' walk away.
Highly recommended.",5,2014,08,03
12,"Excellent value, nice location, great staff","I picked this hotel as the rate was low at the last minute and as a Ambassador Gold member in the IHG I knew I'd get great service. I was not disappointed. The staff were wonderful. Made me feel really special, allocated me and my friend a lovely room on the second to top floor. It's about 30 minutes walks into town (or use the Metro), and 10 minutes from the Royal Palace. We had a view of the Palace from our room.",4,2014,07,29
12,Far from the maddening crowd...,"Good hotel located behind Barcelona Fira and stone throw away from Montjunic Musical Fountain. About 300m away from subway, Airport Bus stop and also Areans Shopping Mall. 
Room is good except that the chain lock was installed incorrectly and unable to serve its purpose. When I  told the cleaning lady she just shrugged it off as OK. She asked me why I needed it? It was surprising to hear this response from hotel staff. There are 2 layers of window and the outside layer was unable to close fully. This means some traffic noise still come in.

Buffet breakfast is ok with the usual spread at Euro 14 if you prepaid in full at check in. Otherwise it is Euro18. Coffee and tea making facilities is good for an European hotel. Full facilities like choice of tea, decafe coffee and even Nespresso capsules for Premium rooms. 

Will return to stay.",4,2014,07,28
12,"Clean, cool, comfortable sanctuary!","We had a brilliant experience here! The location was perfect for us, we walked everywhere we wanted to go to and being in a centrally located hotel was key. The room had a king sized bed, a 50"" Samsung smart tv with hdmi sockets to plug in to near the bed and at the desk, which for me was awesome as a techy guy! The room was very spacious, had a big sofa bed as well, shower was huge, great water pressure, air conditioning was perfect. Absolutely loved the room. Very friendly reception staff, business centre was quick and easy, and painless for me to do my airport online check in and print offs. Recommend this place to anyone!",5,2014,07,27
12,Pretty darn good,"My husband and I spent four days here for my birthday and was impressed. 
Pros: 
hotel is in Catalunya and close to tube. Nice area for visiting fountain (right up street). Just really a great location. Also the bus to the airport is 6 euro pp and fast. 
Hotel is clean. Room is very clean. Kudos to cleaning staff they do an amazing job. They really make sure the details are on point. 
It was my birthday so my husband arranged with Fernando (front desk agent) to do something nice for me. Fernando really took very good care in helping him make my day feel special. I am a platinum member and an ambassador so things like this matter. I specifically look for this bc I stay at IHG properties so much. 
The rest of the staff were helpful in giving us directions and just very open to making sure we got what we needed. 
I highly recommend this hotel. It has a high tripadvisor rating for a reason. The rooms are spacious and cozy. Just magnifique!!!

Only con is room service. The food was not good and kind of weird. Freshly made and quick service but just tasted bad. Not bad as in bad ingredients just not well made. I must say tho I had issues with food in barcelona period. We ate at several different places and only enjoyed one serving traditional cuisine. There are plenty of restaurants nearby so no need to worry. This hotel is worth the stay. 
",4,2014,07,24
12,Best Crowne Plaza !,"Really great hotel ! Stayed one night and defiantly will come back again  

Great location near the Plaza de España , The metro staion is 400m away.

The rooms are huge , 2 queen size beds in standard rooms ,the bathroom is huge as well.

A/C and Wi-Fi worked very well.

Comparing to all hotels that I've looked around in Barcelona this is by far the best value to money ratio. If you are an IHG member you might get more discounts if you book it early and late check out included in the price by default.

Highly recommended !",5,2014,07,24
12,stay with style in Barcelona,"What a good surprise. The room was huge (#132), the TV screen comparable to a movie theatre and the service close to perfection. The location is two blocks from Plaza España, Cataluña National Art Museum and the Magic Fountain. The same two blocks from subway station. if I'm back to Barcelona in the future, this will be the place where I'll stay.",5,2014,07,24
12,Great hotel,"Clean and comfortable beds and the hotel smells great. Food at the restaurant is good, loved the anchovies and the ham and cheese sandwich at the bar is excellent. Front desk staff could use some training though, specially the night staff, they are not as helpful as expected. Judith was very helpful, wish more of the staff was like her. The hotel is very conveniently located just walking distance from the Metro and the Arena.",4,2014,07,21
12,Central and good,A very nice and good located hotel. The staf were very helpful and friendly in every level. The rooms were good and we had good breakfast the two mornings in our stay. The hotel will be on our list the next time we are in Barcelona.,5,2014,07,21
12,Room service anyone?,"Nice hotel with large rooms, good amenities and good location (10mins walk to metro and 5mins to the fountains).  However room service is lacking. The room are clean but don't expect consistent replenishment of refreshments and even towels, as the maids are are either too overworked or not bothered; and after two days without we asked at reception and still nothing. Overall 3 is fair as reception staff a little grumpy too. And €14 for the club room seems unfair when you've stayed at so many of this hotel group (would'nt have minded but I suspect that where they were hoarding our refreshments!). Barcelona has lots to offer and if you're getting a good deal stay, but bring your own tea!",3,2014,07,21
12,perfect 5***** hotel,"perfect hotel. 

rooms are 200% clean and spacious, fully equiped. staff really is nice, everything is clean and modern

facilities are great, wifi everwhere in the hotel. great location, close to plaza espana and poble espanyol.",5,2014,07,18
12,Excellent,This is a.clean well run hotel and has a great staff and the location was a few minutes walk to the train or buses.The front desk people were very helpful and told us where to go for dinner and it was a excellent choice about a 5 minute walk and the restaurant was excellent,5,2014,07,17
12,Beautiful City Break - amazing beds,"This was a spare of the moment weekend away with a friend. The hotel did not disappoint. The beds are the comfiest beds I have ever slept on and I've slept on a few (not like that, cheeky). The massive 50"" was stupidly large but watching a movie was amazing, whilst nursing a little hangover. 

Your 3 mins walk away from the magical fountains which is a most see when you visit Barcelona, and a 5 min walk from the arena viewing platform which gives you a 360 degree view of the city. 

La Rambla, the harbour and the beach are a leisurely stroll down the road. 

Worth every penny, would stay again.  ",4,2014,07,14
12,Understaffed or just unlucky?,"It's hard to tell if it's a recruitment flaw or a management problem but when they were present, the majority of the staff displayed a dissatisfaction or disinterest that made interaction a chore. There were exceptions but from very first contact with the one & only staff member on duty at reception it was abundantly clear that we were a burden not welcome guests. After waiting 10 minutes for the sole staff member to get off the phone, we were informed that we could have checked in at the Club Lounge. A little hard to do when you've no idea where it is & there are no signs but handy to know for next time. 

Room was nice other than the things that didn't work like TV & aircon. Club Lounge is lovely. Nice furnishings & lovely ambience, Breakfast in the Club Lounge was excellent. Other snacks, not so much. Range of drinks was good on the first day but weren't replenished once finished so got worse over the 3 days. 

Dinner in the main restaurant was inappropriately expensive but reasonable quality. Staff we're reasonably attentive but predominantly mono-lingual. Not a fair criticism as I am too. It was just unfortunate for me that my main language isn't coincident with that of the restaurant staff. 

Despite the annoyances above, my main gripe is an easy one to fix. Stop serving UHT milk! It destroys the flavour of otherwise reasonable coffee & leaves an after taste that couldn't be removed even with liberal application of the ever-dwindling supply of Club Lounge liquor. ",3,2014,07,12
12,Gitana,"Fabulous clean and welcoming room with good coffe machin. The staff are extremely friendly and always ready to help. The hotel is in an amazing location, with the Magic Fountain just down the road and easy access to the bus and train stops, which are right outside the building. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast, as it was fresh with lots of variety. It is located near by the fira Center of Barcelona, Arenas Shopping Centre in Barcelona’s Plaza España. We loved this hotel:)",5,2014,07,11
12,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful and in a great location.  The metro is a short 5-7 minute walk and is immediately accessible to the Red and Green line, both of which stop at La Rambla.  Additionally, if you arrive by bus (from Girona airport or somewhere else), there is a metro right outside the bus station that connects the red line right to the hotel.  The room was large and clean.  We would definitely recommend this hotel!!!",5,2014,07,08
12,One of the most comfortable hotels I've been in,"Although this is certainly not a flashy hotel, nor does it offer grand views, it more than makes up for this in comfort and service. The location is on a quiet street, but a fairly quick walk to Plaza de Espana and the metro. The rooms are huge for a hotel in a major European city, and, with double doors to the hallway, extremely quiet. The internet worked well. My cousin and I stayed for three nights, and the front desk always seemed to be well-staffed, with helpful personnel. It was hands-down the best hotel in our 2-week trip from Paris, and not the most expensive. I only wish the restaurant were a bit more affordable, but there are plenty of options within easy walking distance. If you're looking for a quiet room with understated luxury, comfort, and great service, this is the place!",5,2014,07,08
12,Nice hotel,Great rooms at this hotel. We were a family of 4 and had 2 double beds which made our stay very comfortable. Breakfast was not incl and was expensive at ear 18 per person. Not too many eating joints around the hotel. Its a short taxi ride away from Ramblas which has all the action in barcelona.,4,2014,07,08
12,Pitty about the staff ,Stayed here for harley days nice hotel but restaurant staff rude and slow housekeeping desperately bad even when we had the do not disturb sign on the door they would ring the room this was frustrating as we were working nights and needed our sleep ,3,2014,07,07
12,Great place to finish our great vacation!,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona-Fira Center after an 11 day cruise.  The day before disembarkation, which was fortunately a port day in Barcelona, we found out there would be a taxi drivers' strike on disembarkation day.  We went to the hotel early, talked to the front desk staff, and they were more than happy to stow our luggage overnight so we didn't have to haul it on and off buses the next day. Very accomodating!
  This hotel is in a beautiful location, three blocks down from the National Palace on a shady side street.  There is a hop-on-hop off bus stop across from the Palace, and metro and bus service a short distance away in the Placa d'Espanya.  It is an easy walk, maybe 20 minutes, down Ave. Paral-lel to La Rambla, or just get on bus D20 and it will take you to La Rambla and the big Columbus Monument.  We were newcomers to Barcelona, but it didn't take long to figure out public transportation.   
   A short walk up the hill past the palace and you are in the beautiful Mont Juic area and can visit the Olympic Stadium from the 1992 Olympics.  Even though the fitness center of the hotel is being renovated right now, they provide you access to a fitness center nearby, or you can enjoy the shady streets and go for a run!
   The rooms in the hotel are huge by any standard, not just for people getting off a cruise ship.  We paid extra for the club level, and it was well worth it.  It included an excellent breakfast, beverages, cocktails, and snacks available all day in a private lounge.
   There is a restaurant connected to the property, but we went out to area restaurants to eat.  If you head down toward Ave. Paral-lel on the side street (I think the street is Lleida),  there is a cute tapas place called Casa de Tapas.  It was really fun, and just a few minutes walk.
   There are always a few cabs parked out in front of the hotel (except if they're on strike).  We asked for a quote to the airport and felt it was a little high.  The concierge in the club lounge called a cab for us, and with tip it was about forty euro. There is also an airport bus that leaves from Placa d'Espanya which would probably be a good option if you don't have a lot of luggage.  It is a relatively quick trip to the airport from the hotel.
   I would definitely recommend this hotel to fellow travelers.  I wouldn't hesitate to return here if I am lucky enough to get back to Barcelona some day.",5,2014,07,06
12,Home away from home,"There is a thin line that mark a big difference between customer service and good customer care. We always choose IHG as our home away from home because of their consistent attention to details. Nicolas, at the club lounge, is a fine example of the professionalism that set them apart. Friendly, warm and very helpful, this young chap went that extra mile to a six star attention, making us feel like there is no better place away from home. Good job! Thank you so much.",5,2014,07,06
12,"Great Location, great treatment","We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona for eight days which included a conference. Initially everyone said 'you are too far from La Rambla' which caused me some concern. How wrong they were! The Montjuic location was fantastic. A block from the Magic Fountain and Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC), a short walk to Placa Espanya and the tourist bus stops and one block from the wonderful Casa de Tapas Cañota for a great meal. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and very keen for us to see the typical Catalan sights while we were in town. Bookings at restaurants & tourist information were readily available. A taxi stand was located right outside and the metro was a short walk away. Sight seeing tickets could be arranged through the Business Centre on the ground floor. The rooms were well appointed and spacious even after a week. The restaurant had an excellent menu and the food was very tasty. The conference facilities were very good. Recommend staying here.",5,2014,07,04
12,"Very good hotel, business event","Great hotel and venue for business events. Very good rooms and facilities in fairly central location.  Very good business and conference facilities, good food, bars and friendly staff. Location near the art museum and Olympic park.",5,2014,07,03
12,Really good hotel,"Could not fault this hotel, the rooms were lovely well furnished as you would expect from a Crowne plaza. the location is near the magic fountains and the bullring, getting about is quite easy on the metro (5 minute walk away) or by taxi, most journeys to other local attraction were no more than 10 euros. If you do go by taxi always take a business card with the hotel address on it, as local taxis seem know this hotel by other names such as Fira Palace. So it was easier just to hand them the hotel address on a card to return to the hotel.
The restaurant in the hotel was good value with great food which is unusual for hotel of this type. The breakfast where great, just about anything you could think of was served on the breakfast buffet",5,2014,07,01
12,Brilliant rooms. Great base for business or a stopover.,"For the price (about €100) this hotel served us perfectly for a one-night stopover before catching a ship from port. The level of quality was surprising, with the amazing showers, lovely toiletries, comfy beds and panoramic view. Not a 'chain hotel' experience and can recommend. Feels very much like a business hotel so not the best for a romantic break, but well equipped. Only downside was the reception staff who were all unwelcoming and unhelpful. And also breakfast wasn't included, but I'd recommend going to the bakery across the road or a nearby cafe as it seemed expensive at the hotel.",5,2014,07,01
12,"Great room, shame about the restaurant","We had a huge room, huge bed, huge bathroom with all mod cons, very clean, quiet and the air con was good and quiet. Can't fault the room or the other hotel facilities except for the restaurant. Overpriced and ostentatious is how I would describe it. Would definitely stay there again but would find other places to eat in the evenings. Staff were friendly and service very good.",5,2014,06,30
12,Things gone from the room,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 days. Everything was fine, but when I returned to my room before check out I found that room is cleaned, and my things were gone. Thank God the safe was closed and the documents it remained safe. Called several times at the reception desk - no one picked up the phone. I went down to the front desk - there were very surprised. After a long search my belongings were found in the trash. Not very nice. More and maid claimed that she took these things from another room. Although  in this room staying my colleague and he was not yet check out. I was very upset. And this situation has left negative impressions from Barcelona.",2,2014,06,29
12,Very good but there were a few issues,"The hotel is in a good location and quite easy to find. There are plenty of bars and restaurants near by.

The rooms are spacious and finished to a high standard. 

A few thing put me of 5 stars. The air con is rather weak, there was a funky drain smell when we had showers and the breakfast is overpriced. 

Would I recommend yes but I would look for somewhere else if I return to Barcelona. ",4,2014,06,28
12,Great hotel in great location,"Clean, spacious, modern rooms in a good location at a very reasonable price. What more is there to say! The breakfast is 18 euros which is a bit pricey. If you do try it, get the double chocolate muffin. Its  really good ;)",5,2014,06,28
12,Nice Hotel Near the Magic Fountions,"We stayed about a week here.  The location is ideal for shopping at the old bullring, to see the magic fountains at night, and walk Montjoic.  The breakfast has a large selection of foods.  We did not eayt at the restaurant at night, but here it is good.  The bar area is very nice and service was very good.  Would return.",4,2014,06,26
12,Highly Recommended,"As a family travelling with young children, we weren't quite sure which area of Barcelona would be best for our home base. I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center. 

Rooms are very spacious (way bigger than any other hotel I've been to in Europe), clean and comfortable. The area is relatively quiet (compared with Las Ramblas or the ports) and not particularly touristy - very close to the beautiful Parc de Montjuic, which is great for walking, picnicing, etc. The hotel is a 5-7 minute walk to the Espanya metro station - so you can get anywhere in the city in short order. There are many good restaurants in the area. If you run out of imagination and don't want to try your luck at the many small owner-operated restaurants frequented by locals in the nearby Poble Sec area, there is a mall with several tourist restaurants in the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya very close by.

Hotel is also only 20 minutes from the airport. The buffet breakfast was just ok - typical hotel buffet breakfast. Price was reasonable (especially compared with hotels in other areas of the city)

While this hotel caters more to business travellers, it ended up being great for our family as well.",5,2014,06,26
12,Vacation in Barcelona,"I had a really good time in my stay at your Hotel, the hotel was so much nice, the room is so clean and comfortable it was a very good choice to stay at your hotel, the receptionist are so much helpful and have a good spirit at work. The breakfast has a lot of variety and so much delicious.
Special thanks to Mr Fernando who helped me and my friends to choose a very good area to visit it "" Sitges"".

Thank you and Best Regards,
Rana Antoun",5,2014,06,25
12,Fira Good!,"Clean, friendly and efficient with large rooms to house a large TV!

Quiet AC but thinnish walls but not a big a problem.

Effective cleaners but inconsistent replenishment of tea/coffee/biscuits etc.

Great location for me anyway and close enough to transport and the action. ",4,2014,06,24
12,Great place to stay and see Barcelona,"We stayed a week here recently. The standard of the hotel was excellent: clean, large rooms which were well looked after, excellent selection of food for breakfast, very good food served in the restaurant, especially the €20 deal. There was excellent Wifi connection available in the room and in the lobby area.
The hotel is close to the fountains and some of the museums, and is a short walk from the Metro with access to the rest of Barcelona. It can be reached by bus from the airport.",5,2014,06,24
12,"Far away from everything, but a very nice hotel","If you don't mind taking a cab or metro to the Ramblas, and want nice rooms with terrific service, you should stay at this hotel.  It is close to Magic Fountain and the Bull ring shopping mall.   I was here for a conference and upgraded to a better room so that I could have enough workspace during my breaks and access to the club lounge.  Everything was perfect.  I would go back in a heartbeat.",4,2014,06,23
12,Good location,"This hotel opened a few months ago after much renovation, and the design of the impressive lobby and huge rooms is wonderful. The room was the largest we had on our European trip, and it was nice having a separate shower and tub. The location in a quiet neighborhood in Montjuic was wonderful. About 5 minute walk to the metro stop at Placa Espanya. Very easy to get around to all the major attractions. Las Ramblas is about 4 stops away on the metro. If you are visiting on a weekend during the spring/summer walk two blocks to see the wonderful Magic Fountains with shows every half hour 9-11pm. It was a highlight of our trip.
Only problem we had is housekeeping trying to get in our room at 11pm without knocking. The front desk did not really have an explanation and acted like it was no big deal.The manager the next day said that housekeeping does clean some rooms at night. Seemed strange especially at that late hour. Made us wonder about security.",4,2014,06,17
12,Great base away from the center,"I have just returned back from the fantastic City of Barcelona following a weekend away with some clients, this is the second time I have used this hotel and for good reason, The rooms are a generous size with a good standard of finish with ample storage for a long stay if required. Each room has a great desk area to work, and soft chairs to relax in, and the room is fitted with the largest TV I have seen in a hotel room. The large Bathroom is fitted with separate walk in shower and a bath/shower with good lighting, all finished to a high standard. 

The reception area provides clean ample space to sit and relax , and the reception staff are very helpful, nothing was to much trouble.

The Hotel always has taxi's outside which is great, however some of the drivers all think they are Fernando Alonso, cost of a trip into the centre costs 7-10 Euros, so you also have the choice of dropping onto the metro and 3-4 stops and you are in the Centre.The metro is 500 meters around the corner, which is very handy, block tickets are available, but the charge to the centre 3 Euros.

Also for a nice stroll out you are right next door to the Museu Nacional D'Art de Catalunya a very impressive Museum which you have to clime fountain lined steps to to top where the view is very impressive.

If you don't want to travel into town to eat you have a number of restaurants on the top floor of the converted Bull Fighting Arena, just around the corner, below them is a small but compact shopping mall with some major high street names.

Whilst this is a business type hotel it allows you to enjoy a good standard of accommodation at reasonable prices if your flexible. .",5,2014,06,17
12,Couldn't have asked for more.,"I love this hotel. I would have no hesitation to recommended this hotel to anybody or even go back myself and I don't like he same hotel twice. 

The location is great, right in the heart of Barcelona with a short walk to the Magic Fountains and the National Art Museum, leading to the Playa Espanya shopping mall and the Metro station to get elsewhere. 

The staff are extremely attentive and friendly and no job is too small for them, you ask for it, you've got it.

The rooms are so spacious and have everything you could need for a room for the night, if not more. 

The food is wonderful, some classic dishes as well as Catalan twists on others. 

If you can, upgrade yourself to have use of the club lounge, you won't regret it. It's worth the money, trust me!",5,2014,06,16
12,Very Good,"The hotel is located in a quiet residential neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
We travelled as a family and had booked 2 rooms. On checking in early at 12.30 PM we were provided one room immediately to store our luggage and freshen up (Check In time was 3 PM). The check in procedure was quick and easy.
The rooms are very spacious and some have two queen beds and can comfortably accommodate a family of four in one room.
The bathroom is also very spacious.
It is conveniently located close to the Bus Touristic stop (5 minutes walk).
Very close to the port and the airport (driving time from both is around 15-20 minutes).
Town centre (La Ramblas) is 10 minutes by taxi (Fare Euro 11-15).",4,2014,06,12
12,"Very pleasant hotel in a very nice, quiet location","The Fira Center hotel is a very pleasant hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood, within easy walking distance of the Placa Espania and the Parc de Monjuic. The rooms we stayed in was large, with a nice bathroom, and a view across the Carrer de Lleida - a quiet thoroughfare. Walking around the neighborhood is very enjoyable. Room service with a smile is available. Various attractions in the city - the Sagrada Familia or the old city downtown - are easily reached from several convenient metro stops that are within a short stroll.",4,2014,06,11
12,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I spent two nights in the crowne plaza after a cruise.     The hotel has lovely rooms which are very large with huge bed and plenty of space to sit and relax.    Free wifi  also which was quick and efficient.    We had a club room which was well worth the money as the club lounge is lovely with an excellent selection of food and drink available all day.     The receptionist pepa in the lounge is very efficient and extremely helpful.    She seems to have an excellent knowledge of barcelona and is extremely efficient.     The buffet breakfast was also very good in the lounge and I would say it was not necessary to pay for breakfast in the dining room as there was a Vast selection of food available.     The staff are all very good and treat all clients as VIPs      I was unfortunate to have an accident when in barcelona and can't thank the staff enough for their assistance.        I was also given a lovely fruit basket, water and note from the manager which was an extremely thoughtful touch for a hotel and shows their level of customer service.     Coffee machines in rooms are a good touch.        The location  is a bit out of the way but it's not hard to get to the centre of barcelona.        You are 2 minutes from the  Magic Fountains which are fantastic to see  at night.      The old bullring has restaurants at the top where you can dine and watch the fountains.      Very much a business hotel which shows in its standards.        Great for a few days in barcelona  if you like comfortable beds, great staff and are not worried about being a little bit out of the way.    We only spent 2nights in the hotel but if I had a longer stay would probably choose a hotel with an outside space to relax in which was the only thing missing for us at this hotel.        The hotel however met all our expectations on the trip we had and we would use again if we stayed in barcelona.     Thanks once again to all the staff who assisted me their customer service skills are excellent!",5,2014,06,10
12,Very comfortable hotel near the Exhibition Centre,"I spent two days at this hotel, which is located near Plaza Espana and the exhibition centre. The room was big, silent and very well equipped. Beds are very comfortable. Staff is very heplful and kind. Breakfast includes fresh squeezed orange juice (I hate commercial juice). It is very easy to get to the hotel from the airport (bus for only 2.10 €, even faster than train + metro). I recommend it for business trips and why not for tourists: it is a commercial area but very close to centre.",5,2014,06,10
12,Great Hotel,"We spent a weekend at the hotel. Beautiful Hotel, rooms are big and very clean. staff is wonderful. breakfast is nice. definitely a 5 star hotel.  the only fault I could find is the location  - pretty far away from the center of Barcelona but just a short metro ride away.",5,2014,06,08
12,A great stay,"Just back from a 4 day vacation in Barcelona. We chose Crowne Plaza Fira Center. 
Here is my review:
Location- 5/5
a 5 minutes walk to Plaza Espana with its Shopping, restaurants, Metro station, Tourist Buses, and convention center. Direct bus link to Airport 5 minutes from Hotel ( on Paral-El) cost 2.15 per person ( save 30 Euro taxi ride)
Room (Deluxe room 6th floor)- was quiet, 3 elevators service  with no waiting, room well eqipped, with an espresso machine, kettle, huge smart TV screen connected to internet. I even paired my IPAD to the TV,  Ironing board, safe deposit box,  full bar. 5/5 
One remark- Sensor system lights go on automatically when I go to toilet at night and wakes up my partner.
WIFI- Fast free WiFi working smoothly. 5/5 
Cleaning - Twice daily. 5/5
Reception- cooperative and pleasant. English language of some staff reqires improvement- 4/5
Business center near reception- at my disposal 5/5
In total- a great experience.",5,2014,06,07
12,Hotel to be improved  in Barcelona,"As Royal Ambassador member I try to stay always in Hotels of these chain in Barcelona, however I wouldn´t say this is my favourite Hotel in Barcelona

Negative aspects:

1.- I didn´t get any VIP treatment as I arrived and I wasn´t offered any upgrade neither any explanation for availability for the upgrade

2.- The only newspaper I was offered was ""El País"". They didn´t get any other option and in my opinion they should have at least a couple of options (Not only the PRISA group newspaper)

3.- The breakfast needs a huge improvement. For a Crown Plaza you might expect something really better. No option for omelette or fried eggs and the scramble eggs were at the ""hot plates"" section had not only a very bad aspect but were not hot at all. No good options or varieties for hot meals and or pastrys

4.- Pillow options were for medium to big ones. They didn´t have soft ones

5.- Location Not in the best spot of the city.

The positive aspects

1.- Clean Hotel and the rooms were quiet

2.- Great option in the toilette soap, conditioner and shampoo (great smell and  sensation)

3.- Free nexpresso coffe for Loyalty members

4.- Free WIFI conexion and fair speed

5.- They offer a gym around the corner for free since they are fixing the Hotel one

6.- Great coffe at the lobby bar

7.- Peplo in reception very nice and gentle",3,2014,06,03
12,Good location!,"Stayed here over a year ago, back when it was the Fira Palace. Really liked the location...close to the harbor (we were going on a family cruise), also within walking distance of several restaurants, an artists village, and a large shopping plaza. Rooms and bathrooms were huge, especially by European standards. Great breakfast in the morning with lots of fresh fruits, baked goods, cured meats, etc (this may be different now since its owned by Crown Plaza). The only downside I could find to this place was that at the time, the rooms were a bit dated (brass fixtures, older carpeting)...but from the photos it looks like its been recently refurbished, so this is likely no longer an issue. If I am ever in Barcelona again, I would most definitely stay here a second time.",4,2014,06,01
12,Very friendly - extremely helpful staff,"This was a city break stay for myself and my wife. It was a new hotel and we were initially apprehensive as there were very few reviews. I needn't have been, the hotel was great, very clean, of course new, all amenities you could ask for. We stayed in the executive suite and it was well worth the extra money. Drinks and snacks provided and the concierge service was impeccable. From start of the stay to the end of our break, they (especially the young blonde lady who could speak so many languages! - A credit to your company) could not have been more helpful. From the very warm welcome, to booking tickets, recommending hotel and advice of the surrounding area. The stay was a very pleasurable one, and would definitely recommend both a beautiful city and a wonderful hotel. Thank you",5,2014,06,01
12,Exceptional service,"We had this hotel booked for our recent trip to Barcelona however due to overbooking, they offered alternative accommodations. Being our first time in Spain and having done a lot of hotel research, we were really disappointed by the turn of events. To Crowne Plaza's credit, they treated us amazingly well and offered refreshments while they researched other hotel options. They ended up going above and beyond by relocating us to a more central area and providing breakfast. It's really made a lasting impression for us not only on the city but the hotel chain as well.",5,2014,05,28
12,Very comfortable and good service.,"We stayed at this hotel on my birthday at the beginning of May. We were caravaning in the area and had decided to pre book a night away in the city. Unfortunately our reservation had not come through from the company we booked with and although there was what seemed to be a lengthy check in, the hotel was able to check us in the same room type we had chosen on line.
The room was very comfortable and clean. Super bathroom with robes, separate toilet area and separate shower area as well as a bath.
I had chosen the hotel because of its vicinity to the magic / musical fountains which were well worth the visit in the evening. It was lovely just to be able to stroll back to the hotel rather than have to trek back to a more central one.
Breakfast was good with plenty of choice, both hot and cold. I did not dare ask if the champagne on ice was an extra!?
Staff very attentive. Were able to provide a plug adapter when asked.
We even asked for a second large cup (the hotel only provide one large cup and one expresso size) and this was delivered within 10 minutes of asking.
I would stay again if returning.",5,2014,05,28
12,Great Business Hotel,"Attended a conference here in April and passed a lovely few days. It's location to FNAC allowed a 5minute stroll to the museum, Montjuic and the Olympic Village. 
The hotel was lovely. Rooms were very impressive but I just go the feeling it was more corporate. I was an early arrival and they accommodated my request for a high floor, were quick on check in and just generally very helpful. There were always plenty of staff available for assistance and as large meetings go they ran it very well. The food was fantastic and service excellent. I loved the style, the food and location and would highly recommend it.",3,2014,05,27
12,Recommended for Business Trippers & Travellers,"Really liked the rooms and service from the Hotel .We were mesmerized to the room size and facilities provided at the Hotel .High quality toileteries and products in bathroom .Huge HD Tv and nice room facilities were provied .The problem was with the breakfast provided ,hotel limited options on breakfast which me and my frinds travelling didn't liked much .We stayed on A floor at room 043 and the we could only see gensets placed  and windows opposite building .This place is very near to the market and one could take a walk in the evening to click pictures and enjojy the sceninc view near by hotel .All in all we liked the service of hotel very much .",5,2014,05,27
12,GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT LOCATION,"ASK for Maria Montero she is just lovely, she was helpful beyond request. we asked where a Starbucks was and the Gaudi Cathedral she gave us extra information on what to see and sent us up maps to get us to these locations in Barcelona, The room has UPC ports in the walls as well as 115V 230V plugs for charging and there were more than one we could charge all of our devices at the same time unlike most Hotels. Great internet service, the staff is AMAZING. its just a short walk to the main Square where there is a Museum and A Magic Water Fountain light and water show in the Evening.  Thanks Maria Montero and the rest of the helpful staff for making our stay PERFECT!  James and Theresa Mortensen Windsor California",5,2014,05,21
12,Up to the expectations,"We spent five nights in this Hotel. It's a business type Hotel, up to the expectations. The room was large and clean. Just a little bit noisy because overlooking the road. The Hotel is very well located. A little bit far apart from the beach that can be however reached pretty fast by taxi. Very close to Mont Montjuïc... good for jogging or walking in the morning or in the late afternoon after a full working day. Plenty of places around where you can eat... the arena is very close by.
Very interesting breakfast with extremely polite service. The third morning the Lady serving at the table remembered my coffe preferences of the previous day and set up the table accordingly. Deeply appreciated. A small early bird breakfast (Nespresso coffee and cookies) helps if you're leaving early... I enjoyed it before my runs.",5,2014,05,18
12,Great place for a quick stop over,"My husband & I were passing through Barcelona & used rewards points to book the room for one night. I can't say anything bad about it - room was very, very clean and spacious. Everything was nice and new. The breakfast wasn't included & is kind of pricey, but we went out and got something quick on the way to the train station the next morning, so not a problem. I did appreciate the coffee / tea station in the room. Had we been staying in Barcelona longer, I'd probably try to get something a little less ""American"", but for one night it was perfect & I'll admit, after a whole bunch of European B&B's and hotels, it was nice having a shower that you could actually, say, turn a full radius in. We we able to walk from the train station without problem - that took maybe 20 min or so. The metro station was even closer.",5,2014,05,16
12,Very easy accessable and excellent rooms,"This hotel is easy to reach as a traveller, take Aero bus and exit Placa Espana and from there 10 minutes walk! Very nice hotel, rooms has been freshed up and are completely redone. Nice pillows and great TV - never seen a screen larger! Breakfast very good and everything there. So in total a very good Hotel!",5,2014,05,16
12,Great Hotel,This is a great place to stay. I stayed there for 4 days with my family.The hotel rooms are really spacious with modern luxury. Breakfast is great.Staff is helpful. Convenient location.Will stay here again for sure.,5,2014,05,15
12,Not Just for Business Travelers Anymore,"Just got back from Barcelona and loved the hotel. We were a 3 generational family with ages ranging between 2-87. Large and well-equipped rooms, including reliable wifi and espresso machines. Located in a real neighborhood, with all the services a body needs - just off Plac Espanya, the Magic Fountain and the bull fighting ring converted into sparkling new shopping mall. Metro to downtown and Parc Guel. Wonderful, diverse breakfast with all food groups represented and a fabulous staff which is both friendly and efficient. A real upgrade and treat relative to the tourist class hotels on the Rambla for the same money.",5,2014,05,08
12,Large room/amenities.   Huge TV.   Good internet.,Our room was quite large. Huge TV - probably about 6 feet long!   Good in-room and bath amenities.  Quiet.  Very plush bath towels.   About 8 minute walk from Espanya metro for easy access to anywhere in the city for just over 1E/ride when you buy 10 rides.  5.90E bus each way to BCN.   Limited good dining/sightseeing options away from hotel in immediate area.   Large business center with about 8 desktops. Good free internet.  In-room service could have used some improvement but very minor issues.   No concierge desk.  Seems to cater more to business traveler than tourist.,5,2014,05,03
12,Very nice and comfy,"Very good location, next to the magic fountains and other attractions. Bus stops are close by. Very clean rooms and luxurious bathrooms, a great lobby and adequate swimming pool. Only thing is noise can enter the room from the corridor. An excellent stay for families and it's also not too far from the airport. ",4,2014,05,03
12,Great hotel,"Enormous and comfortable room;  totally renovated; quiet area but convenient to Placa Espanya. Attentive and helpful staff. The only annoying feature was the indicator light on the a/c which lit up the room. We covered it with a sock and we're okay. Pp
      .",5,2014,04,27
12,Great location for a quiet night's sleep.,"Great location and the size of the room is generous.  We found lots of places to eat nearby that were great so eating in at the hotel wasn't as appealing.  We cannot comment on the food.  The first night we had a room for three of us, we were there for spring break with our 21 year old son.  It was uncomfortable as the beds were only full size, not queens as we had been told.  They moved us into a junior suite the second night which was a much better fit for our situation.  The pull out sofa bed was not as comfortable for our son but the king size bed was much better for us and we had two rooms rather than one, which was much better.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and we had a wonderful stay.  I would recommend the hotel highly especially since other areas of Barcelona are known for being much more of a noise problem.  If you are looking for the singles crowd, you may want to look somewhere else.",5,2014,04,21
12,"Perfect hotel but a bit ""Business""","The Crowne Plaza hotel in Barcelona is excellent but it is a bit boring or maybe just a bit 'business' (a matter of taste and preference I guess)
It misses the intimacy but for the rest it is very good in every way. Location is good, adjacent to Montjuïc and the Olympic center with Placa D'Espanya  around the corner.
We got an upgrade to a very nice and spacious suite (from the IHG loyalty program).
The Club Lounge is very comfortable and the blonde hostess is extremely helpful and service minded, minding the smallest detail and helping out with planning trips and sightseeing, super!
Absolutely a comfortable and luxurious stay with value for money.  
+ Spacious, everything is high quality, bathroom/shower, super big thick towels
- Small windows, breakfast is not bad but could be better, lacks 'intimacy'",5,2014,04,17
12,relaxed business hotel with excellent staff,"This hotel has recently been renovated and so much improved compared to my visit 2 years ago. The rooms are large and modern. Nice beds, giant desk, sitting area, minibar, ironboard and nespresso and tea facility. Good bathroom with bath and shower. There is a business center where you can make prints free of charge. Breakfast was what you expect in a 4-star hotel and lunch idem. All you need for a comfortable stay. If you dont come to work: There is a cute tapas restaurant and one upscale restaurant really nearby, but it is not a swinging neighborhood. What really makes the difference with other 4 four star hotels is the staff. This hotel used to be named Fira plaza, now it is Crowne plaza fira center. I dont know whether they retrained staff.... But there were exceptionally friendly and service minded. It was top of the bill prior arrival by email, at the frontdesk, at breakfast at the meetingsrooms, at the bar. No exception. They promised that they will have a wellness center next visit. Definitely coming back when I need to be in town for work.",4,2014,04,01
12,"mostly good, might get better","The Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center is a lovely hotel. Modern and sophisticated in both the lobby and the rooms. The bathroom was gorgeous - lovely fixtures, nice products for guests to try, lots of towels, bright lights and tub and a shower. Reception staff are pleasant, helpful and friendly. I wish my hotel room had more natural light, but this is what you often get with downtown hotels.

A few problems. I was like another guest who booked the hotel looking forward to swimming and workout and was disappointed to discover that the facilities were being renovated and we were expected to go elsewhere. I was irked that I had not been informed beforehand; I could have saved some room in my luggage. I also wonder if renovation is responsible for the odd smells that came from my plumbing - sewage smell one day, sulfur smell the next. Both came and went, but were unpleasant nonetheless. A final problem was the housekeeping. My room was poorly cleaned each day - definitely tidied, but unpleasant little details like muck left on the dishes, 3/4 of the tub clean, 1/4 still with soap scum, and a spill in the fridge that was there when I arrived and remained until I left. 

I say things could get better because the gym will eventually reopen and you could get luckier with your housekeeper. I thought the location of the hotel was perfect because it was on a quiet street but a short walk to the subway and several local attractions. A short subway ride or longer walk to most things in the city. A beautiful park nearby and lots of cafes, restaurants, and even a grocery store (underground, next to the subway station). I was staying at the hotel for a conference and the conference details were handled efficiently. I agree breakfast was a bit costly, but it was convenient and had lots of options - about as good as you could expect from a hotel breakfast buffet. After the conference, I went elsewhere for breakfast.

I would happily stay here again for a conference or just for visiting Barcelona, although I would check to see if the gym and pool were open. In the end, the good things balanced off the bad.",3,2014,03,19
12,I want to live there!,"I booked this hotel for a weekend for my sister's birthday. We were checked in quickly and someone offered to take our bags up to the room for us. The room was just beautiful! everything was perfect and exceptionally clean and the beds were so comfortable I wanted to take it home with me! the staff there were very helpful in telling us good places to eat, shop etc too.
We were right near loads of bars and restaurants and also near the beach, perfect location! 
We will definitely be coming back to this hotel for our next trip to Barca :)",5,2014,03,18
12,LARGE TVs!,"I stayed at the Hotel Fira Palace mid-February on a business trip. It is very close to the beautiful National Art Museum of Catalonia and about 30mins walk to the main shopping area on La Rambla. There are also various types of public transport available nearby if you aren’t feeling energetic. 

The rooms are modern, clean, spacious and bright with huge Smart TVs which means if you don’t speak Spanish you can still watch something in your native tongue on the net. I spent quite a bit of my first day working from my room and on two occasions staff walked into my room, the first time they knocked and came in to replenish the minibar and the second time two maintenance guys doing work on my floor who didn’t think it necessary to knock barged in and as neither of us spoke the other’s language it made for an interesting “discussion”! 

Apart from the interruptions the hotel itself is in a good location and has the necessary amenities for business travel, i.e. iron and board, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities and the WIFI is adequate. The food in the restaurant is decent and the breakfast buffet has a good choice. If you are in Barcelona on business it is a good base to work from but if you are looking for a hotel with a bit of a buzz you won’t find it here.",3,2014,03,13
12,Exceptional Service & Stay,"I stayed here on a business trip recently and was pleasantly surprised - the service quality was excellent and the rooms were impressive. The rooms in the hotel are fairly large, about 40sqm each, which provides ample space even after including a sofa, an armchair, work desk, luggage rack and bed - great if you are travelling with a considerable amount of luggage.

The bed was comfortably and the sheets were of decent quality. I personally like the way the bathroom is configured into three distinct partitions - one for the shower, one for the WC and bidet, and the main partition containing the tub and sink. Cleanliness is very good overall, and the toiletries provided come in aesthetically pleasing tubes.

I had access to the lounge which provided an excellent selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages all day - unlike some lounges that limit the alcoholic offerings to a select few hours a day. Breakfast in the lounge was also decent, albeit somewhat limited in variety. Service overall was welcoming and wait times were minimal at the lounge reception counter.

What made the hotel special is the little touches they provide - such as a ""good night sleep"" kit which included two aromatherapy bottles in the form of a pillow spray and an essential oil that helps with sleep. The housekeeper left a greeting note along with a two pieces of chocolate after making up the room - some touches that count.

In the vicinity are a few restaurants and a convenience store, which provide a variety of food options from pricey fine dining, spanish tapas to cheap ham and cheese sandwiches. Getting a cab from the hotel is quite easy and there are usually cabs waiting at the doorstep.

Overall an excellent stay and will definitely return when I'm in Barcelona.",5,2014,03,12
12,crown plaza,"we have just got back from a  four night stay at this hotel, from the moment we got there we found the hotel was lovely, quick very friendly reception staff, our room was fantastic and huge i mean huge bed, i laid across it and didn't reach each side, the room was large (deluxe I think) we had a recliner chair and foot stools as well, large 40"" TV on wall, lots channels various languages, mainly news,linked to you tube and some other online channels.  also kettle and coffee machine and stocked fridge. nice large bathroom with double shower, also bath in it. sea view over roof tops we were on 6th floor.
the hotel does have a pool etc but its currently being re done, the hotel has just been taken over by crown from what was fira palace.   the breakfast was varied, usual hot and cold etc very good selection. we did not eat in the hotel in the evening, lots good eating places few mins walk away.  we also used bike to rent cycle hire which is a few mins from the hotel, as you come out hotel go across crossing down the road on your right hand side to ave parallel, across it and you will find the shop 200 yrds up on your left, mark will give great service and advice for all cycling things and more. the hotel is 400 yrds from the magic fountains which were supurb to watch, again as come out of hotel turn left and walk straight up road to the fountains and palace amazing views and architecture. love to go back but prices seem to have increased since take over we will try... ps also free wifi largely seems to be a conference based hotel but no issues when we stayed there.",5,2014,03,10
12,Conference venue,"Only stayed here because I was travelling alone and the conference I was attending was held here. It was a reasonable walk (about 20min) to the gothic quarter which was not ideal but there are plenty of restaurants very close to the hotel. In particular I tried to get into the famous ""Tickets"" without success. Rooms were fairly average but clean and had al the essentials however I personally do tend to prefer a bit more luxury. They were very accommodating with my gluten free requirement with GF croissants, muffins and bread every morning for breakfast.",3,2014,03,09
12,Review rejected,"For some reason the review I posted of this hotel has been rejected by tripadvisor. Presumably the hotel didn't like it. Feel free to contact me for any information. Don't get me wrong, really good hotel but there payment policy is awful. Well done tripadvisor for not allowing true experiences to be posted",3,2014,03,07
12,Will be back,We stayed here for one night before joining cruise.  Whisky a bit pricey (€15) but old fashioned measure ie waiter brought bottle to table and just poured.  My champagne cocktail was on par with other decent standard establishments @ €12.  Around art and museum district.  Good choice at breakfast and catered for all nationalities.  Would stay here again. ,5,2014,03,04
12,Decent Hotel,"Decent hotel but exorbitant rates for the MWC week and definitely not worth the charge. Nice big room but hardly any view. Comfortable bed. The breakfast is good but at EUR18 you might find reasonable options outside. If you're planning to be in the city, its well located keeping in mind taxi-able distances to La Rambla or Barceloneta areas which are about 10 mins away with moderate traffic conditions. The palace on montjuic (museum) is walking distance away as is Pl Espana.  Splattering of restaurants around the Pl Espana area.  If the rates down in normal times, it will be a good option.",3,2014,02,28
12,DISRESPECT TO THE CUSTOMER,"It is very beautiful the Hotel, but unfortunately they do not respect the clients as such, they have no mystique of attention and respect especially the Operations Manager, who respectfully holds that position very high... they do not know that a satisfied client brings 10 or more behind him... I would recommend that they make sure of everything before going to this Hotel... I have been to many Intercontinental Hotels around the world and never in any had I been treated so impolitely in fact or stayed in the hotel before such disrespectful attitude",1,2024,06,22
12,Wonderful spa,"We visited the Spa today and the truth is that it was a real pleasure. Aida and Maria treated us with great kindness and professionalism.  The massage was wonderful, the high quality products used were very sensory and the water area was very relaxing. We will be back.",5,2024,06,20
12,Elegance!!,"Excellent Hotel in Barcelona.
Large rooms, very comfortable bed and excellent cleanliness.
Efficient room service and excellent breakfast.
Attentive and attentive staff with a very useful concierge service for restaurant or museum reservations.",5,2024,05,02
12,good hotel,"Beautiful, delicious food and pleasant atmosphere, I gave it four points because two of the elevators were not working for several days and it was very slow to go up or down.
The terrace on the seventh floor is very nice and has food and pool service. There are always taxis available outside.",4,2024,04,12
12,They stole a piece of clothing from my room,"I stayed at the hotel from March 1 to 4 for a business trip. The last night I had left the next day's clothes ready to go to the airport and in the morning I found that the beige silk bodysuit that was what I was going to wear was missing. Immediately upon checking out I informed the administrator of the situation. which says it is going to review, takes my information and never informed me anything. So the conclusion is that I was robbed at the hotel, incredible because one would never imagine that in a hotel of this category this could happen but it happened to me",1,2024,03,22
12,An Intercontinental Hotel as it should be,"Very nice hotel, subtle and elegant style, very friendly staff and wonderful breakfast.
However, the telephone accessibility from outside and inside was often very poor.
The shower is very slippery, a grab bar should be installed.",5,2024,01,29
12,Great hotel but there are things that lower the rating,"Hotel according to what it offers, as soon as you enter you notice what it wants to convey and its elegance both in the insta and in the treatment at reception.
Spacious room, with great quality of sleep, and a useful and comfortable bathroom. In addition to thanking the well-maintained and soft carpet and the quality of the mattress and pillows.
My breakfast buffet is very complete, with quality coffee and an open kitchen where they prepare dishes to order and bring them to the table without having to wait standing for them to finish. I found the products available to be of quality and well made.
What lowers the score is the price of the bar, paying €8 for a bottle of beer from a national brand seems like an insult to me, nothing justifies that price even if you are in a hotel of this category and the same for a glass of wine in the evening. that we paid €10 without it being a wine with a special price and that can be purchased in the supermarket.",4,2024,01,12
12,Little problems under the Spanish sun,"When I asked a few days before the start of our stay, the hotel told us that a room upgrade could only be provided ""subject to availability"". This information, half a year after we made our reservation, is more than unsatisfactory. It does not comply with the principles of the Terms & Conditions for Ambassadors. Any compensation if an upgrade is not available is ridiculously low and does not correspond to the customs in other hotels in the InterContinental group, nor to the customs of how to treat a long-standing member of the IHG loyalty program with well over 100 overnight stays per year. A lot of trust is lost by this approach. 

My IHG profile states, among other things, that I prefer a room on the upper floors of a hotel. We were given a very dark room on the first (!) floor. Although our reservation was made half a year before the actual stay, the hotel was unable (or unwilling) to provide us with a room on the upper floors. The dark room would be ideal for airline crew who like to sleep in dim light. The room was unusable without artificial lighting. 

No ""Welcome Letter"" from management with detailed information about the hotel at check-in, as has been the case in other IHG hotels for decades. 

Spa use in the IC Barcelona is not normally free. €40.00 for 45 minutes of spa use is ridiculous and disproportionately expensive. For just under an hour in the small pool with sauna use, we (3 people) would normally have had to pay €120.00 (€2.67 per minute!), which is by no means the true equivalent. 
We would like to thank the management for giving us free access to the spa area. 

The provision of mineral water in the room is extremely ""economical"". Despite the fact that the room was occupied by three people, we were only given 2 (!) bottles of 0.3 l water per day on several occasions. 

The room furnishings are opulent and tasteful. The beds are very comfortable. It is also worth noting that the bathroom is accessible from two sides. Overall, the quality level of our room was that of a typical European InterContinental hotel. 

The atmosphere in the Club InterContinental is very pleasant; alcoholic drinks are available all day (even Veuve Clicquot champagne). The food on offer in the Club Lounge in the afternoons and evenings, on the other hand, is more than sparse: no cake selection at all, just dry biscuits, in the evening junk food in the form of spring rolls (without soy sauce), mini hamburgers (without mustard or ketchup), Chinese dumplings with no taste at all, reminiscent of rubber balls. The so-called ""Christmas offer"" was the same as the offer from the previous days. No fresh salads, soups, Spanish specialties (e.g. tapas) or other hot dishes. Although the food (except chips) is cleared away at 7 p.m., nothing is replenished long before that time. 
The offerings in the IC Barcelona Club Lounge do not match those of a comparable hotel in the same chain. Considering the high price level of the IC Barcelona (especially in high season), the food on offer in the Club Lounge was particularly inadequate and contradicts the description of the establishment on the hotel's website and certainly also the hotel's self-image as a luxury hotel: ""We have set ourselves the goal of offering you more than just the usual. That's why we focus on well-thought-out details and specially created moments."" The hotel should also meet these high standards throughout. 

Even after our stay at the IC Barcelona ended, the hotel did not let us rest. Instead of immediately crediting the points and nights to our IHG account, it took several emails and a call to Diamond Service until everything was finally in order. Other hotels accomplish this task easily within a very short time, without the guest having to ask for help.

A rating of 4 out of 5 stars is justified primarily by the good quality of the room furnishings and the availability of alcoholic drinks throughout the day. Otherwise, the hotel would only have earned 3 out of 5 stars due to the lack of standards for a 5-star hotel. It is simply not enough to renovate a former Crown Plaza and nail a capital ""I"" to the facade. This alone does not make an InterContinental hotel.",4,2024,01,04
12,Perfect hotel,"Unreservedly recommended for a city trip to Barcelona:
+ large, soundproofed, beautifully furnished rooms
+ super comfortable beds, top bathroom
+ very tasty breakfast
+ breathtaking sky bar and pool with a view over the city
+ foyer, breakfast area and bar are very stylish (see pictures of the hotel)
+ perfect service: very friendly staff who can also remember names very quickly ☺️
+ location
+ small farewell gift

Conclusion: We didn't miss anything and we were 100% satisfied and are enjoying the last night here in Barcelona again today 👍",5,2023,10,29
12,THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOTEL IS FATAL. THEY COLLECT DEPOSIT AS SOON AS YOU ENTER...,"I made a reservation for 3 nights for a gift, and when they went to check-in, they made them pay 300 euros (practically 80% of the total reservation) as a deposit, when the reservation did not include any deposit, And in the opinions that I had read in different search engines about this hotel, neither.
I contacted them and they told me it was hotel policy. I told them again that none of that was indicated in the reservation conditions, and they told me that the manager would contact me. I haven't had a response on the matter since then.
Coincidentally, it was for a young couple (some of whom had to pay in cash, because at that time they did not have availability in mind). I even spoke with the hotel previously on several occasions, and paid the tourist taxes online (which by the way were 41 euros for 3 nights) so that they did not have to pay anything upon arrival.
In my opinion, charging a deposit in a hotel is totally abusive (except in the case of apartments or similar), and even more so considering the amount. I think they did it because they were young people and they didn't trust them, something that seems totally inappropriate to me, and always keeping in mind that they should have specified it in the hotel conditions when you go to make the reservation.
When they left they checked out and it is assumed that their money was unlocked. When they got home, 3 days later, the deposit money was still blocked, and I had to contact the hotel again to have it unlocked. According to them it was a mistake that sometimes occurs.
When they go to charge you there are no errors and they charge you immediately, but then it takes a week to return it to you. A real shame!!
Added to this is the lack of attention on the part of the hotel management and all the inconveniences that all this has caused us with calls and so on, instead of enjoying the stay....
I think that a hotel of this category had to have at least the decency to show its face to its clients. Not everything is money in this life!!",1,2023,08,17
12,"Highly recommended. The treatment of the polite and close staff, good order and cleanliness, food exceeding expectations.","A luxury experience on a rooftop with incredible views. Good treatment and great food.

Por las instalaciones, que también, si no por el equipo humano que nos encontramos, es un hotel que si es cierto no hay muchos clientes nacionales , solo por este Equipo Humano es desde ya nuestro lugar de referencia siempre que vayamos a Barna, queremos destacar a todas las personas que forman este equipo pero en especial queremos mencionar a Sandra, simplemente maravillosa, Joan y Sergio siempre dispuestos a ayudarnos y en hacer de nuestra estancia en el

12,Tolles Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt etwas abseits der Innenstadt, aber mit der nahen U-Bahn ist man in 10min am Las Ramblas. Die Zimmer sind hochwertig eingerichtet, aber leider sind die Fenster nicht die allerneuesten und etwas Geräuschdurchlässig. Daher sollte man wenn möglich ein Zimmer zum Innenhof buchen wenn man es ruhig mag. Service und Frühstück sind erstklassig! Der Indoorpool gehört zum Spa und ist mit 40€/Stunde pro Person leider unverschämt teuer. Der Pool auf dem Dach ist frei.",5,2023,04,13

Su desayuno buffet es excepcional y la calidez del personal lo califico como increíble.

El trato por parte del staff es digno de un hotel de 5 estrellas, Bruno es una  muestra de ello.",5,2022,08,27

12,Tolles Hotel für eine Städtereise,Tolles Hotel mit perfektem Service. Die Lage vom Intercontinental ist für eine Städtereise sehr gut gelegen. U-Bahn Station gleich in der Nähe. Frühstück mit ausreichender Auswahl und ausgezeichneter Qualität. Würde jederzeit wieder das Hotel besuchen.,5,2022,05,08
12,Gut Infrastruktur mit schlechtem Service,"Das Hotel verfügt über eine gute Infrastruktur und grosszügige Zimmer. Der Service entspricht nicht der Sterneklasse dieses Hotels. Nachdem unsere Dusche im Zimmer defekt war, mussten wir unser ZImmer wechseln. Das ging ziemlich reibungslos mit Ausnahme des Kinderbetts, dass erst nach viermaligem Nachfragen umgezogen wurde. Eine Nacht haben wir zu Dritt im Bett verbracht. 

Die Defizite im Service zogen sich während unseres ganzen Aufenthaltes durch. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist ganz ordentlich. Ist man jedoch etwas spöt dran, wird vieles nicht mehr ausreichend aufgetischt. Es werden Eierspeisen angeboten die man separat bestellen kann. Bis man eine Bestellung platzieren kann, dauert es ewig da nur ein Teil des Personals Bestellungen entgegen nehmen darf. 
Handtücher am Pool waren beide Male als wir den Pool nutzen wollten nicht mehr verfügbar. Eine Getränkekarte an der Rooftop Bar ebenfalls Fehlanzeige. Das Personal sprach z.T. sehr schlecht oder gar kein Englisch was es auch nicht immer einfach machte. Es war aber stets sehr bemüht. 
Alles in allem stimmte das Preis- /Leistungsverhältnis nicht.",2,2022,04,18
12,Servicio excepcionalmente amable y Club recomendable,"Desde hace muchos años me congratulo de ser un cliente Ambassador de los hoteles Intercontinental en todo el mundo. Guardo especial recuerdo de las vistas del Intercontinental Tokyo Bay, de las impresionantes suites del Intercontinental Berlin, de la ubicación excepcional del Intercontinental Prague y del Intercontinental en Manhattan, del gran buffet del Intercontinental Paris y del extraordinario personal del Intercontinental Madrid.  Pero faltaba el de Barcelona (reconvertido del Crowne Plaza a un IC de 5 estrellas). Así que un viaje de negocios propició el encuentro. Y no puedo más que agradecer la ocasión de visitar un hotel novísimo (con ese olor que desprenden los coches a estrenar), con habitaciones impolutas y un servicio impresionante, recién estrenado y, sin embargo, enormemente preparado. En breve… toda una sorpresa. Judith (con o sin hache: no lo sé) en la recepción y David, oficiando la restauración, nos ofrecieron (a mí y a mi mujer) un recital sobre cómo debe ser de excelente un servicio de cinco estrellas: atención inmediata, empatía respetuosa, respuesta profesional y, sobre todo, responsabilidad hostelera en cada acción dirigida a nosotros, sus huéspedes. Estuvimos alojados en una suite (magnífica, por cierto) y no pudimos disfrutar de los beneficios diferenciales (por el espacio usualmente exclusivo) del “Club Lounge”… porque todavía no estaba terminado; pero, en realidad, sí los disfrutamos en el espacio que el hotel habilitó en el lobby a tal fin: champagne, servicio atento e impecable, snacks variados y completos a media tarde y, sobre todo, un servicio atentísimo y en absoluto intrusivo. En los desayunos, los huevos Benedict y los “a-la-florentina” (con espinacas) resultaron estupendos, así como la fruta (fresquísima y sabrosa como no recordaba en ningún hotel, de veras), y la amabilidad del servicio acompañaba todo esto… de sobra. ¿Y en la habitación? Pues el mismo nivel de servicio, para lidiar, sobre todo, con el hecho de que la mayoría de las cosas están por ser probadas (como la conexión externa por streaming de los televisores, por ejemplo). Pero todo discurrió con suavidad, porque el servicio fue, en todo momento, amable y atento. Así que, pese a nuestra costumbre de no comer donde nos alojamos, el último día cedimos al ambiente de amabilidad reinante en el hotel y decidimos aventurarnos a probar el zancarrón asado para dos (a baja temperatura)… y poco más. Buena elección, diría yo. Y excelente servicio, de nuevo. He de decir, al final, que el servicio de este hotel, personificado en Judit(h) y David y en el resto innominado del personal que nos atendió, estuvo muy por encima de cualquier otro hotel Intercontinental que hayamos visitado, y más bien, salvando las obvias diferencias, a la altura de otros hoteles (como el Royal Mansour de Marrakech o el Hiiragiya de Kyoto). Yo quedé encantado; y mi mujer también. Así que… ¿qué se podría decir más?",5,2022,02,14

Desde el primer momento todo resultó agradable, tanto en la recepción como en el resto de los servicios, todo el personal se portó de maravilla, con mucho estilo y profesionalidad. 
En el bar, en la terraza, en el comedor todo fue amabilidad y buen servicio, felicitaciones a todos.
Estuvimos en las fechas previas al confinamiento por el coronavirus y en este hotel ya se adoptaban medidas higiénicas al respecto, los geles hidroalcohólicos estaban a disposición de los clientes en los espacios comunes. 
Comenzamos el recorrido por la  amplia y relajante habitación equipada con una fantástica cama King Size, sillón relax, Smart TV, cafetera Nespresso y todo lo necesario para disfrutar de un café, cortesía de la casa. La caja fuerte, el mini bar, el kit de planchado y la conexión wifi gratuita completan el equipamiento. 
El espacioso baño con todo lo necesario, incluida bañera y ducha independientes  con el correspondiente kit de amenities, completa el espacio privado del visitante.
Este crieme plaza dispone de spa y un completo gimnasio que no pudimos disfrutar durante nuestra estancia por falta material de tiempo, lo dejamos para la próxima ocasión. 
Nos gustó especialmente la terraza, donde dispone de una piscina con sus correspondientes hamacas y una zona de estar con cafetería-bar-restaurante súper agradable, con impresionantes vistas sobre Barcelona, una gozada.

Leider Kosten die Kaffeekapseln 2,50€ Aufpreis, nicht weit gibt es jedoch einen Nesspresso Store. Es gibt einen Spabereich der allerdings 25€ Aufpreis kostet, das Fitnesstudio ist kostenfrei.

Frühstück super, aber teilweise die Tische nicht abgeräumt und wieder neu eingedeckt. ",3,2019,10,10
12,Excelente ,"Segunda vez en el hotel, totalmente recomendable, calidad descanso muy buena, personal amable y atento.desayuno muy bueno. 
Variedad de almohadas, amenities muy agradables.
Totalmente recomendable. En nuestro próximo viaje, seguro que volveremos. ",5,2019,09,08
12,Impeccabile,"Voto decisamente positivo per questo hotel. Personale gentilissimo,camere grandi e pulite dotate di tutti i comfort.colazione abbondante e deliziosa.posizione altrettanto buona ,vicinissima piazza di Spagna.consiglio assolutamente!",5,2019,09,06
12,"Eccezionale, niente da aggiungere","Ho soggiornato per tre notti presso questo albergo e devo dire di esserne rimasti più che soddisfatto. Il personale è estremamente disponibile e cortese, le camere e gli spazi comuni pulitissimi ed i servizi complementari più che soddisfacenti.
La palestra è bene attrezzata e la piscina è molto graziosa. Se avete la possibilità di accedervi, consigliatissimo un salto nella lounge, per colazione o per un aperitivo serale.
Di certo ottima la posizione, vista la centralità rispetto a molte delle attrazioni della città e la vicinanza con snodi importanti della viabilità cittadina.
Barcellona è una città splendida, ma ancora meglio se avete modo di soggiornare in questo hotel. Raccomandatissimo.",5,2019,08,25
12,Eccellente per attenzione cliente e servizi,"Ero un po’ perplessa perché mi aspettavo il tipico business hotel. 
Invece l’ho trovato molto adatto anche per un viaggio in famiglia, con alcuni tocchi di stile ( fantastico il root top sia di giorno che di sera) e molta attenzione e gentilezza da parte del personale. Mio marito ha avuto un problema di salute e sono stati molto efficienti e hanno anche chiamato nel corso del soggiorno per verificare se la situazione fosse migliorata. In un hotel così grande con tanto passaggio non è scontato. 
Grazie ad un upgrade avevamo una suite molto spaziosa ( con arredamento un po’ business perché la seconda stanza era in pratica uno studio). 
Super il rooftop. Mi ha convinto meno l’accoglienza al ristorante el Mall. Non ho provato la spa. Comodissimo parking sotterraneo collegato da ascensore. 
Vicino al quartiere poble sec ricco di ristoranti molto carini ( ma scoperto solo ultima sera),  A due minuti a piedi da fontana magica.",5,2019,08,20
12,Una certezza!,"Hotel di livello, prenotato camera con accesso alla lounge e prima di partire sapevo già che mi avrebbero dato upgrade gratuito in una suite.
Comoda e spaziosa, dotata di ogni tipo di accessorio, macchinetta Nespresso inclusa, ed accesso alla lounge dove si può bere una vasta scelta di drink, champagne incluso, si fa' la colazione con ottimo assortimento ed in tranquillità assoluta.
E, per puro caso, appena fuori dall'hotel pizzeria napoletana verace con pizza veramente buona.
Direi di andarci ad occhi chiusi!",4,2019,08,11
12,Dia de chicas,"Dia, genial en el Spa del hotel!! Nos han tratado genial!! Durante 90 min. Hemos disfrutado de las saunas, los yacuzzis, los chorros y cascadas de agua!! Con una música relajante y al final con una copa de cava!! Muy recomendable, sin duda...volveremos!! gracias por un día inolvidable!! ",5,2019,08,03
12,Consigliato,"Bellissima struttura, moderna con personale di alto livello, alcuni dei dipendenti alla reception parlano benissimo anche l'Italiano. Ci hanno dato indicazioni su tutto che potevamo vedere e fare.
Grazie tanto.",4,2019,07,25
12,Ottima struttura,"Ho soggiornato con mia moglie e mia figlia (11 anni) dal 13 al 17 luglio 2019.
Hotel molto pulito, camera molto grande, pulita, silenziosa e con tutte le a comodità di un 4 stelle S.
Posizione ottima, vicino a piazza di Spagna o alla fermata metro o bus di Poble Sec. Con la metro in 4/5 minuti, senza cambi, si arriva direttamente alla Rambla oppure con il bus D20 direttamente alla spiaggia dì Barceloneta.
Comodissimo anche se si arriva dall’aeroporto con la metro o bus (fermata Place d’Espagne).",4,2019,07,19
12,Satisfactorio,"Muy buen hotel alejado del bullicio y con dos estaciones de metro a unas 6 cuadras cada una. Habitaciones muy amplias, cómodas y con muy buen servicio. Desayuno muy bueno pero lejos de ser excelente. Algunos motivos: escasa variedad de panes, falta de un adecuado control en la higiene precisamente con los panes (en más de un día faltaban servilletas de tela para sostener el pan para cortarlo), inexistencia de leche fría y muchos trainees con escasa experiencia aunque con voluntad. La pileta abre a las 11hs, cosa que me parece desatinada, porque si alguien quiere tomar sol o nadar por la mañana no puede. Salvo estos aspectos a considerar, la atención y el hotel son muy buenos.",4,2019,07,16
12,Sensacional,"Nos hospedamos 3 noches con toda la familia.   La amabilidad y el servicio del personal es de primera.  Las habitaciones comodisimas, descanso de primera y ubicación inmejorable, a pocos metros de la estación del metro y el bus.   Regresaría sin dudarlo, un agradecimiento especial a Marc nos ayudado con reservas, ubicación de lugares, transporte, etc.   Buen trabajo chicos ",5,2019,06,26
12,Für den Preis OK! ,"Das Personal war freundlich, die Zimmer sauber. Aber nichts besonderes.
Das Frühstück war leider nicht so gut, aber man konnte es essen. 

Der Poolbereich auf dem Dach ist ziemlich klein und der Pool an sich auch, aber um den Abend ausklingen zu lassen, absolut ausreichend. ",3,2019,06,16
12,hotel bellissimo,"hotel molto bello, pulito, accogliente ed ottimo servizio. uno dei migliori crowne plaza che ho visitato. Posizione comoda vicino la metropolitana e dei ristoranti e bar dove poter godersi una tapas. Molto bello",4,2019,05,07
12,Da ritornarci al più presto . Tutto ottimo . ,"Ho prenotato due camere per 4 adulti in questo splendido hotel vicinissimo a Plaça espania ed alla bellissima fontana magica e devo ammettere di aver trovato a mio modo di vedere un servizio eccellente ( tutti i dipendenti sempre sorridenti e sempre disponibilissimi a cercare di soddisfare le varie esigenze che un cliente può avere ) . Anche le camere sono state di mio gradimento anche per via dell’upgrade ricevuto come cliente Spire Élite . Camere veramente spaziose , pulite e servite di tutti i servizi con un bagno altrettanto comodo e con il servizio di rifacimento camera che passava due volte al giorno . Ultimo commento positivo va alla lounge dove avevo possibilità di fare colazione o bere qualcosa in qualsiasi ora del giorno . Onestamente non ho mai visto un club lounge così fornito per la colazione . C’era una vastissima scelta di salato e di dolce e ripeto , un’assortimento così io non l’ho mai trovato in nessuno dei tantissimi hotel da me utilizzati per lavoro o per vacanza . Complimenti quindi per come viene gestito questo hotel e per la dedizione che tutti i dipendenti mettono nell’affrontare giornalmente i loro compiti .",5,2019,04,30
12,"Buena ubicación, tranquilidad y silencio","Magnifica ubicación, habitaciones amplias y muy silenciosas. Cómoda cama.  Limpieza perfecta, Atención estupenda, resuelven cualquier incidencia con gran amabilidad y rapidez. Desayuno variado, y muy bueno.",5,2019,04,12
12,"Amplio, cómodo y funcional","Es un hotel moderno sin grandes lujos pero muy funcional y cómodo,con habitaciones muy amplias y confortables. 
El desayuno es sencillo pero bastante variado y con un buen horario.

El baño es ideal para las mujeres porque tiene una iluminación fantástica para maquillarse cosa que no ocurre normalmente.
Eché de menos un buen secador de pelo y cepillo de dientes en el baño.",4,2019,03,30
12,Durchschnittlich ,"Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend und trotzdem ist man in ca. 5 Gehminuten beim Plaça d‘Espanya von dort aus hat man eine super Verkehrsanbindung. 
Wir hatten ein Doppelzimmer mit einem King Size Bett gebucht, jedoch wurde uns bei unserer Ankunft mitgeteilt, dass keines für uns zur Verfügung steht und so mussten wir die ersten zwei Nächte von insgesamt fünf Nächten in einem Doppelzimmer mit zwei Einzelbetten schlafen. 
Im ersten Zimmer war es ziemlich dunkel, da der Ausblick in den Innenhof war und man genau in ein anderes Haus hinein blickte und man sich dadurch auch ziemlich beobachtet fühlte. 
Im zweiten Zimmer war es wesentlich heller und der Ausblick war Richtung Tibidabo, was wirklich schön war. 
Die Sauberkeit war völlig in Ordnung und die Betten waren auch bequem. 
Wir hatten kein Frühstück dabei, man konnte es zwar vor Ort dazu buchen, allerdings ist der Preis viel zu hoch genauso wie die Preise der Minibar!!
Achtung beim SPA - wenn man ihn benutzen möchte, muss man dafür extra bezahlen und der Preis war dafür auch sehr hoch (möchte jetzt keine falschen Zahlen nennen)!!!
Im Großen und Ganzen war das Hotel ganz okay, allerdings würden wir bei unserem nächsten Barcelona Urlaub ein anderes Hotel nehmen. ",3,2019,03,21
12,EL MEJOR HOTEL EN BARCELONA,"Si tomamos como referencia la localización, la comida, los servicios e instalaciones,  la amabilidad, las habitaciones y el precio, en mi opinión es el mejor Hotel de Barcelona. 
Empezando por su gran Chef Juan Sánchez, que cocina con una gran elegancia los mejores productos, así como Susana de la Sala de comedores, hasta una masajista excelente ( por si vais es rubia pero no me acuerdo del nombre ) y todo su personal muy atento y amable, es EXCELENTE. No os perdais los desayunos con el mejor jamón ibérico que habreis comido nunca, o comer y bañaros en la terraza disfrutando de las vistas, etc, etc, etc. ES EXCELENTE EN TODO.",5,2019,03,20
12,Tutto perfetto ,"Struttura moderna e ben tenuta. Camere ampie e spaziose, con tutti i comfort. Colazione abbondante e variegata. A 5 minuti da piazza di Spagna da dove in metro si può raggiungere qualsiasi parte della città.  Zona piena di locali per passare la serata. Consigliatissimo. ",5,2019,02,25
12,spa: super oferta!,"Fuimos por nuestro fiesta de empresa de navidad. El Spa es muy lindo y agradable, incluye un masaje de media hora. Muy relajante. Cojimos una oferta de atrapalo a un precio muy bajo. Un encanto. Solo falta un fuente adentro para beber agua. Volveré seguro.",4,2019,01,16
12,Comodidad empresarial,"Es un hotel con amplios espacios para realizar reuniones de empresa. Es habitual el ver alojados a la tripulación de aerolíneas. Las habitaciones son amplísimas con una televisión espectacular, rincón de lectura en sillón reclinable y mesa de escritorio. Únicamente hecho de menos la presencia de más enchufes en la mesilla de noche. 
El desayuno es muy correcto pero ligeramente por debajo del nivel del hotel.
En cuanto a la ubicación está lo suficientemente cerca del centro como para que resulte cómodo y de fácil acceso desde Sants y El Prat.
En la planta baja dispone de sillones cómodos para poder descansar o trabajar un business córner como y amplio.
Dispone de una terraza en la azotea que no he podido ver con lo que no sé qué aspecto tendrá. 
",4,2019,01,11
12,Splendido,"Bellissima struttura moderna situata a pochi passi da piazza di Spagna comodamente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto con l'aerobus in 10 minuti - numerose sale lounge, ampia reception e ristorante -  personale cortese e parlante italiano - ampi spazi con divanetti - presenza di SPA a pagamento - camere enormi, pulitissime e molto confortevoli - consigliatissimo",5,2019,01,03
12,Hotel molto bello,"Questo hotel si trova a 5 minuti da piazza di Spagna (quindi non proprio in centro che è raggiungibile a piedi in circa 40 minuti, oppure con bus e metro), a sinistra della fontana di Montjuic che venerdì, sabato e domenica si illumina a suon di musica. 
La struttura è molto bella, le camere spaziose, il bagno con sia la vasca che la doccia, molto pulito e confortevole. Unica ""pecca"" , almeno per chi soffre di allergia, è la moquette. Il personale è davvero molto gentile e disponibile. Dall'ultimo piano, dove in estate è aperta la piscina, si può godere di un bellissimo panorama sulla città. La colazione costa 19€ a persona: noi abbiamo preferito dirottare su locali vicini.",4,2018,12,18
12,Hotel molto buono,"L'hotel si trova in una posizione non centrale ma comunque ottima. È molto vicino alla fontana luminosa che si illumina tutte le sere con uno spettacolo di luci e suoni. Ci si arriva a piedi uscendo dall'hotel. Non molto distante dall'hotel ci sono le fermate della linea 2 della metro. Molto comoda in quanto arriva in centro in pochi minuti e ci sono corse frequenti. L'hotel è ben pulito, ordinato e la colazione è molto ricca, continentale, ampia scelta di cibo durante la colazione.",4,2018,10,31
12,Muy buen hotel,"Muy buena situación, al.lado de plaza de España pero en una calle muy tranquila . Cercano a restaurantes de todo tipo .
Habitaciones muy amplias con baño y ducha .Camas enormes . Desayuno muy completo ,solo he echado de menos yogurt q no sea de vaso. Desconozco el precio pq no he pagado yo ",4,2018,10,19
12,La migliore accoglienza come Spire member,"Il Fira Center è un ottimo hotel in linea con la qualità che contraddistingue IHG in generale e Crowne Plaza in particolare. 
Stanza molto ampia e confortevole con letto enorme, piccolo studio adiacente, bagno perfetto.
Ciò che contraddistingue il Fira Center è la disponibilità di un Club Lounge dedicato agli ospiti fedeli alla catena IHG dove fare colazione e passare qualche momento di relax con un drink durante la giornata ""all included"".
All'ultimo piano vi è una terrazza con ristorante bar piscina: un'area per il giorno ma anche per la sera con vista panoramica a 360 gradi della città.
Last but not least personale molto professionale ed attento alle necessità del cliente tra cui tra l'altro ritrovare Michela alla reception già conosciuta nell'altra ottima struttura Holiday Inn Zara di Milano.
Sicuramente un hotel dove ritornare alla prima occasione di un weekend a Barcellona!",5,2018,10,14
12,Caro para servicio y atención,"La ubicación del hotel es buena, los cuartos son bastante amplios, en comparación con el resto de los hoteles en Barcelona. Sin embargo, están viejos. Artículos de baño buenos, pero la atención del personal bastante regular.",3,2018,09,24
12,Super Hotel mit tollem Frühstück und attraktivem Angebot,"Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig, sauber, gut ausgestattet, großes Bad mit Dusche und Badewanne sowie WC.
Bügeleisen, Hausschuhe und ein gut bestücker Kühlschrank waren ebenso vorhanden wie der Safe und der große Flachbildschirm, das Bett war riesig und sehr gemütlich, die Shampoos und Seifen waren wohlriechend und Fair Trade.
Einziger Schwachpunkt war ein etwas schlecht Schließendes Fenster, das aber auf Grund der ruhigen Lage nicht störend war.
Das Zimmer war halt nicht mehr ganz neu aber super in Ordnung.
Das Frühstück bot nahezu alles was man sich wünschen kann, Toast, Spiegelei, Obst, Wurst, Käse, Müsli, Mehlspeisen, ich hätte den ganzen Tag frühstücken können. Mir hat es an nichts gefehlt.
Die Rezeption war stets mit besonders freundlichen Mitarbeitern besetzt die einem alle Fragen beantworten konnten und immer helfen konnten.
Das Reiche Zusatzangebot konnte ich leider nicht in Anspruch nehmen, aber es gab jede Menge davon, Pool, Sauna, Fitness, Massage, und und und.
Lediglich den herrlichen Ausblick vom Dach inklusive Drink im Strohkorbbett den muss man einfach genießen, das war echt der Hammer!
Auch der öffentliche Nahverkehr ist sehr gut angebunden. U-Bahn, Bus sind sehr nahe gelegenen.
Ich würde das Hotel sofort wieder buchen!",4,2018,09,21
12,Hotel Top posizione Top,"Struttura molto bella e moderna con ampio parcheggio interrato. Vicinissimo al centro di Bercellona è a mio parere un Hotel strategico per turismo e lavoro. Rimarrete piacevolmente sorpresi dalla bellezza e dimensioni delle camere, complete di tutti i comfort. ",5,2018,09,15
12,Excelente trato y calidad,"Estuvimos hospedados en este hotel dada su ubicación, y nos sorprendió a todos. Lo primero que llama la atención es la amplitud, desde el hall a las habitaciones. Son enormes, con 2 camas muy amplias y cómodas. El descanso esta garantizado. 

El desayuno es amplio y variado y me encanto que tuviera producto típico de Cataluña para preparar, como el salchichón, pan y tomate.

El gimnasio es también digno de mención, limpio, amplio y con unas máquinas modernas. 

Ya he hablado de su buena ubicación, junto a la feria de la ciudad.

En su conjunto, es una opción excelente para la visita a la ciudad, especialmente para Negócios en la feria.",5,2018,09,09
12,Vistas desde la terraza ,"Estuvimos para cenar en la terraza del hotel Crowne Plaza. 
Ambiente relajado, informal con música en directo de jueves a sábado incluido. 
Carta de tapas y platos principales buena, con variedad.
Cenamos muy a gusto siguiendo las recomendaciones del responsable ,Agustín, nos aconsejo muy bien y el servicio excelente.
También hacen cocktail no los probamos pero tenían muy buena pinta.",5,2018,07,31
12,MEJOR IMPOSIBLE,"El Hotel es perfecto, aparte de que esta recien renovado, la terraza de la azotea, ahora en verano en un lujazo!
La situación, inmejorable, a pocos metros del hotel hay varios Restaurantes buenísimos, teatros y amplia oferta de ocio.
El trato es muy muy bueno, todo te lo hacen fácil.
Muy buen desayuno, zumos naturales y fruta decente!!
Para repetir seguro!",5,2018,07,24
12,Sensacional,Hotel con una localización privilegiada en Barcelona. Las habitaciones amplias y la cama muy cómoda. Soy miembro IHG Royal y ademas de un upgrade de habitación tuvimos el check in y los desayunos durante la estancia en el Lounge Club donde estuvimos muy a gusto. Tiene una terraza en la azotea con piscina y una vista preciosa de la ciudad. Estuve en el Spa donde la chica que lo atendía resulto de lo mas amable y con unas instalaciones de gran calidad. Sera mi hotel cuando regrese a Barcelona.,5,2018,07,13
12,Große Moderne Zimmer & Rooftop Bar,"Es handelt sich um ein sehr schönes (Business) Hotel, mit großen modernen Zimmern. Sauberkeit und Ausstattung waren hervorragend. Der Ausblick vom Zimmer war auf einen Großen Innenhof hat mich persönlich nicht gestört (einziges Manko). Die Rooftop Bar ist toll inklusive kleinem Pool. Zur Messe und Font Magica ca. 400m (Hop on Hop off Haltestelle) und zum Museu Nacional d Art de Catalunya und Plaça d‘Espanya ca. 600m. Wer Wert auf höheren Comfort legt, ist hier richtig (zahlt dies aber auch).",4,2018,07,09
12,ECCEZIONALE!,"Cosa si può volere di più da un hotel ? Le camere sono grandi , pulite benissimo, con letti comodi , tanti dettagli che vanno dagli accappatoi , alle macchinette per il caffè , televisore enorme ecc ecc. All'ultimo piano c'è anche una piccola piscina con un pool bar dove si può anche mangiare, con vista su Montjuic e Barcellona. Il personale è gentilissimo ed anche gli spazi comuni sono molto belli. Molto vicino a Plaza de Espana e al Poble espanol. Stupendo!",5,2018,07,05
12,MUY RECOMENDABLE!!!!!!!,"Estuvimos alojados en este hotel el fin de semana del Sonar. Fue muy cómodo salir del hotel y tenerlo justo delante. Unas habitaciones muy correctas y un personal muy atento es lo que mas destacaría del hotel. El desayuno es correcto, pero sin mas. La zona de la piscina tiene unas vistas impresionantes sobre Barcelona, aunque por lo grande que es el hotel es muy pequeña la terraza, eso si, puedes comer allí disfrutando de las vistas (aunque los precios son algo elevados).",4,2018,07,03
12,Un lugar en el mundo,"Si no fuera por mis raíces porteñas y tanguearas, viviría gustoso en la hermosa ciudad de Barcelona. Desde el Montjuic hasta el Tibidabo y desde El Prat de Llobregat hasta la Sagrada Familia, esta ciudad no tiene desperdicios. Pasear por Las Ramblas o ir de compras por el Paseo de Gracia, admirando el modernismo de Antoni Gaudi gratifica el espíritu. Nadie debería dejar de conocerla!

",4,2018,06,27
12,Para recomendar,"Muy buena ubicación, habitaciones muy amplias. Atención excelente.

Apenas hicimos el check-in y sin requerirlo en el front desk nos llenaron de información valiosa de como moverse en la ciudad (mapas, tarifas, etc.)

No pudimos disfrutar de las instalaciones porque teníamos mucho para recorrer, pero el hotel cuenta con una excelente piscina.

 Volvería sin dudarlo.",5,2018,06,20

das frühstück ... es war von jedem etwas dabei aber das personal war dort nicht gerade freundlich 
sonst war alles ok",3,2018,05,20
12,Excelente el Serena Spa by Heaven On Earth,"Me regalaron un circuito Spa con masaje en el Serena Spa: simplemente excelente. Un servicio de lujo desde la llegada, las instalaciones muy limpias y el ambiente muy adecuado. La masajista tuvo un trato exquisito durante el servicio. El masaje se puede decir que fue efectivo, contundente y dejó muy buenos resultados.
He probado otros masajistas y quiromasajistas sin el mismo resultado. Una hora con esta masajista, y adiós dolor de meses. Seguro regresaré. Gracias por contar semejante equipo de profesionales.",5,2018,05,16
12,Hervorragendes Hotel,"Sehr zentral und doch ruhig gelegen, die Zimmer haben Doppelfenster und z.T. Auch Doppeltüren. Sehr freundliches Personal. Außerordentlich gut die Lounge, in der allerdings um 2300h die Bürgersteige hochgeklappt werden und dienGäste rausgeschmissen werden. Frühstück ebendort super.",5,2018,05,14
12,El mejor hotel de La ciudad,"Sin duda este hotel de Barcelona reúne todas las condiciones para ser el mejor hotel de la ciudad.

Las habitaciones son súper cómodas, recién remodeladas y son muy amplias. Las televisiones son de última generación e inmensas. Los detalles están cuidados meticulosamente en cada uno de sus rincones. A modo de ejemplo, el hotel ofrece una fragancia para colocar en la almohada para dormir mejor. Este es uno de los detalles entre tantos, que hacen que la estancia en este alojamiento sea excepcional.

Además, el servicio es inmejorable. Todos son muy amables y educados.

Entre los servicios que ofrece el hotel, destacar el maravilloso spa con una variada y extensa carta de masajes. 

Por último, resaltar el 173 rooftop terrace, una terraza con impresionantes vistas a la ciudad, que dispone de una piscina climatizada en forma de pecera. El restaurante dispone de una carta variada, cada uno de los platos cuidados hasta el mínimo detalle.

Recomiendo este hotel ya que no sabría ponerle ningún pero. 

Por último, mencionar su inmejorable ubicación. 

Muchísimas gracias por el trato recibido. Espero volver muy pronto!!!!",5,2018,05,05
12,Muy buenHotel!!,"Nos ospedamos casi una semana en este magnifico Hotel,

Un bufete para los desayunos que lo consideraria uno de los mejores en los que he estado.",5,2018,04,26
12,VACANZA A BARCELLONA,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per quattro giorni per le vacanze pasquali.
Hotel pulitissimo, camere comode e funzionali, a dieci minuti a piedi dalla fermata della metro Espanya dove in pochi minuti si può raggiungere Plaza Catalunya o la Rambla.
Dall'aeroporto si può prendere la metro e cambiare a Europa Fira per arrivare a Espanya.
Personale gentile e disponibile, ci siamo trovati bene e lo consigliamo a tutti.",4,2018,04,25
12,Sehr gutes Hotel am Montjuc,"nett an den Parks und der Messe gelegen in ruhiger Gegend, trotzdem mit dem Taxi in 15 min zu erreichen vom Flughafen. Tolles Zimmer, nette IHG Lounge für Statusgäste. Nette Veranstaltungsmöglichkeiten und Spa, Bar, in der man versumpfen kann",5,2018,04,22

Location comoda vicino alla vecchia fiera ",5,2018,04,18
12,Vorübernachtung Kreuzfahrt,Wir hatten ein Zimmer für 3 Personen als Vorübernachtung einer Kreuzfahrt gebucht. Im Vorfeld hatten wir einen frühen Check-in angefragt. Unsere Anreise erfolgte am Vormittag und unserem Wunsch wurde erfreulicherweise entsprochen. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und die Betten komfortabel. Wir konnten unser Gepäck im Zimmer und die Wertsachen im Safe deponieren und somit ganz entspannt die Stadt erkunden. Wir werden das Hotel bei einem weiteren Barcelona-Aufenthalt gerne wieder buchen.,4,2018,04,07
12,Sehr gutes Hotel  mit super Personal ,"Uns hat der Aufenthalt sehr gefallen.
Hotel ist gut gelegen (nahe Plaza espana)
Metro und bus in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen.
Zimmer sauber, groß und gut ausgestattet. Empfang war 1A und wir konnten auch schon ein wenig vor der ""normalen"" Zeit einchecken.

Frühstück fanden wir gut aber mit 19€ ein wenig überteuert.

7 Stock ist eine bar mit tollem Blick über Barcelona.

Der Pool ist klein aber nett. Hier hätten wir etwas mehr erwartet .

SPA war ebenfalls toll.

Alles in allem daher 5*",5,2018,03,28
12,Muy bueno,"Buena ubicación; plaza España, cerca de dos estaciones de metro. Se puede llegar caminando a restaurantes y lugares turísticos (Mont Juic)

Molto consigliato sia per esigenze lavorative che per viaggi di piacere. ",5,2018,02,25
12,Una sola notte a Barcellona,"Sono riuscito ad attaccare ad un viaggio di lavoro un rapido weekend con mia figlia quindicenne. L’hotel è lussuoso e confortevole, le camere ampie e ben arredate, ottima la sala per la colazione, il bar in terrazza e gli altri ambienti comuni.
Comodo a piazza di Spagna con la relativa stazione della metro e gli autobus per l’aeroporto. ",5,2018,02,25
12,Servicio bueno. Anscesor rápido limpeza. Muy bien para reunión y Jornadas,"He estado allí por motivos de trabajo y la hospitalidad y el Servicio ideal.
Todo bien y correcto.
Trato estupendo.
Si eres celiaco o sufres alguna intolerancia ailmentaria, avísalo y recuerdalo tantas veces como puedas. Suelen anotarlo y recordalo cuando insistes. Los panes sin gluten son ricos pero muy pequeños",5,2018,02,18
12,Excelente,"Pasé una semana alojada allí por motivos laborales y fue una experiencia estupenda. Cama confortable, baño reluciente y buenas amenities. La atención de los trabajadores es inmejorable, y el desayuno de lujo. Muy bien comunicado, totalmente recomendable",5,2018,02,07
12,Rozando la perfección ,"Viajamos 3 adultos con 3 niños en dos habitaciones comunicadas, perfectamente equipadas con mini bar, televisión de gran formato con funciones smart tv y conexiones en el escritorio para el móvil y ordenador. Un baño con ducha y bañera. Muchos detalles de bienvenida, de bienestar y en el aseo que tenia espejo de aumento con luz integrada y albornoz, nos sorprendió el regalo de aromaterapia para descansar mejor. Un sillón de relax, cafetera nespresso, hervidor, etc... 

El gimnasio equipado con máquinas Technogym de última generación para correr, elíptica, sube escaleras, combinadas para tren superior e inferior, trx, mancuernas y bancos de la misma marca premium, tv y máquina de agua en la misma sala y servicio de toallas. Además contaba con un tirador de emergencia en caso de sufrir un incidente.

El spa muy bonito y agradable con un sinfín de tratamientos.

Destaca en sobremanera la limpieza de todo el edificio, incluso en los rincones ocultos.
Un garaje en el mismo edificio con acceso a recepción y amplio, con cargadores Tesla para enchufables.

El personal, suficiente para no tener que esperar y muy atento.

El desayuno entre los tres más completos que he conocido, no faltaba de nada, si no estaba te lo traían enseguida.

Por sacar alguna pega, a pesar de ser 3 personas en cada habitación, no había cama supletoria ni juego de toallas o albornoz para el tercer ocupante.",5,2018,02,07
12,Totalmente recomendable para conciertos en Montjuic,"Si llegas en AVE incluso podrías ir andando al hotel, aunque el metro al estar a dos paradas y 5 minutos andando, es otra opción. El hotel cómodo, hace honor a su categoría, amplias habitaciones y muy buenas instalaciones. Para los conciertos en Montjuic es ideal ya que la via de salida mayoritaria es andando y si hay suerte, coger un taxi en Plaza España y antes de llegar ahi, ya estás en el hotel. Cogimos una oferta por lo que además salió redonda la estancia.",5,2018,01,19

12,Ottimo Albergo a Barcellona,"Ottimo albergo a dieci minuti a piedi da una stazione della metro in avenida parallel.
Stanze moderne e molto confortevoli, colazione internazionale dove gli inservienti provvedevano a rinnovare immediatamente qualsiasi pietanza fosse esaurita.
Bella piscina all'ultimo piano anche se il periodo invernale non ne permette l'utilizzo.
Albergo silenzioso.
Zona SPA presente ( ma non ne abbiamo usufruito).

12,Soggiorno stupendo! ,"Ho passato 6 giorni a cavallo di capodanno presso questo magnifico hotel, trovando tutto perfetto, dalla stanza (spaziosa, comoda, dotata di ogni comfort, pulita benché dotata di moquette, che diversamente dal solito non mi ha provocato alcuna reazione allergica), al ristorante El mall, alla colazione, alla cordialità dello staff. Ho usufruito della palestra, pur piccola, non della spa, di cui ho sentito parlare bene da altri ospiti. Vicina la metro Espanya, a due passi da Montjuic e dalla sua fontana magica. Stra consigliato, marchio simbolo di eccellenza. ",5,2018,01,06
12,Excelente!,"Excelente atencion, muy buen lounge con todo incluido y personal amable. El hotel esta a unos pasos de plaza España y del centro comercial. Recomendado tomar el bus citytour y dan dos euros de descuento x paquete - ayuda a conocer mejor Barcelona. El spa del hotel completo y con todos los servicios.",4,2018,01,03
12,Wo sind 4 Sterne?,"Bewohnen immer noch dieses Hotel. Also auf den ersten Blick nett, die Zimmer sind geräumig und grundsätzlich ist alles da was macht braucht. Allerdings erwarte ich bei 4 Sterne etwas mehr. Wasser fehlt, Handtücher nicht komplett, gesaugt wird nicht täglich! WLAN Probleme, teilweise auf dem Zimmer gar kein Internet! Heizung hat nicht funktioniert, der Kühlschrank war auf Null - sparsam😊Badezimmer Tür schleift, aber ist ja nicht unser Boden (mein Mann hat 3 mal Bescheid gesagt).
Lage; Ja okay - nicht zentral, aber kein Problem Metro und Bus ums Eck.
Tolles Frühstück? Es ist nicht schlecht aber auch nicht gut. Teeauswahl schlecht und schmeckt nicht. Kaffee unterirdisch. Espresso ja ist gut. Warme Speisen zu kalt. Der Karottenkuchen schmeckt und das Obst, nur die Kiwis sind steinhart.
Wir wechseln nicht, weil zu viel Aufwand, aber wiederkommen würden wir nicht.",3,2017,12,28
12,"excelente   tarde de  spa , tratamiento de masajes y cena","Hemos regalado a una compañera la experiencia del pack de na hora en el spa con un estupendo cirduito de aguas , hammam , sausa finlandesa, duchas , jacuzis de todo tipo,  un masaje en el Serena Spa de 80 minutos estupendo y una maravillosa cena en el restuarant lo recomendamos sin duda",5,2017,12,23
12,Nefasto servicio de catering navideño,"Celebramos ayer noche la cena de empresa y a pesar de la dedicación de mis compañeros de que todo saliera bien alguien se empeñó en aguar la fiesta....
No fue otro que el responsable de dirigir el servicio de catering...
No distribuía bien el contenido de las bandejas no habia ritmo no había sintonía no había cariño NO había nada de nada..
Una de las organizadoras del evento me confesaba está mañana que se sentía engañada.....
Anoche yo en mi condición de camarero de la empresa organizadora del evento me dirigí al responsable para hacerle ver sus errores en el servicio y recibí indiferencia y desprecio...
Ruego a la dirección del hotel que por su bien tome medidas y depure responsabilidades....
Ya saben dónde NO organizar su cena de empresa...
La calidad del producto manifiestamente mejorable y nada que ver con la prueba..
NOS SENTIMOS ENGAÑADOS",1,2017,12,15
12,Estupendo,"Ya había estado hace años cuando era el Fira, y guardaba muy buen recuerdo. Ahora renovado, habitaciones amplias , modernas y cómodas. Desayuno muy bueno. Muy bien situado, yo me fuí andando hasta las ramblas, muy buen paseo. Lo recomiendo si o si",5,2017,12,13
12,Excelente atención!!,"Fuimos mi esposa y yo por una noche y el trato fue excelente. En el restaurante, en la cena, nuestro camarero fue muy atento y agradable con nosotros. La habitación, impecable y muy limpia.
En el desayuno Buffet, riquísimo. Susana nos atendió estupendamente, muy atenta en todo momento que no nos faltara de nada al igual que los camareros. El Spa nos encantó y nos atendieron muy bien. Muchas gracias a todos !!!

12,Entre la ciudad y el parque,"Excelente ubicación, cercano a la plaza Espanya al pie del Montjuic. Con en metro en pocos minutos se llega a otros sitios de interes turístico. Las habitaciones son amplias y cómodas. El personal se encuentra siempre dispuesto a solucionar cualquier inquietud. Muy buen desayuno con un café excelente.  Imperdible la pileta con el bar al lado, perfecta para un relax luego de recorrer la ciudad.",5,2017,11,27
12,Viaje a Barcelona,"Excelente hotel con muy buena atención , los cuartos son grandes , baños amplios el desayuno es variado y de buena calidad, el personal es muy amable y te soluciona cualquier inquietud rápidamente, es un buen hotel para quedarse en Barcelona Unpoco retirado del centro",5,2017,11,12
12,Excelente ubicación para asistir a congresos,"Es un hotel muy bien ubicado con respecto al Palacio de Congresos. El nivel de insonorización es muy bueno, las habitaciones amplias, el baño muy bien equipado. El wifi funciona bien, las camas son cómodas. 
El desayuno es variado y de muy buena calidad y el restaurante es muy bueno. Sí el personal de la recepción fuera un poco más rápido sería el hotel perfecto. Así y todo merece sobradamente los 5 puntos por el nivel de descanso y la comodidad.",5,2017,11,09
12,Bastante bien,"Me gusta mucho este hotel. Habitaciones amplias, con bañera, y con un trato exquisito en recepción. Nunca tienen problemas para ofrecer cama grande aunque llegues tarde en el día. El desayuno no lo he probado. Repetiría",4,2017,10,28
12,Günstige Lage zwischen Konferenz Center und Stadtzentrum,"Habe das Hotel geschäftlich gebucht und Abends jeweils einen Abstecher in die Stadt gemacht. Die Lage ist angenehm ruhig und doch nahe zu Bus und Metro. Taxis stehen auch immer welche zur Verfügung. Man kann auch zwei eBikes mieten, aber eine Miete in der Stadt kommt wohl günstiger.
Das Frühstücksbuffett muss man separat bezahlen. Bei Vorreservation an der Reception kostet es 16 €, andernfalls 18€. Die Zimmer sind gross und modern, aber leider nur schlecht gegen Lärm von benachbarten Zimmern isoliert. Man hört die Unterhaltung der Nachbarn, wenn sie nicht gerade flüstern.
Sehenswert ist sicher auch die Dachterrasse mit dem coolen Pool mit Glasumrandung uns Aussicht über die Dächer von Barcelona.",4,2017,10,28
12,Excelente hotel,"Acudí hace unas semanas en solitario por un evento profesional.
Hotel muy moderno, elegante y bien cuidado. Situado en las inmediaciones de la Fira de Barcelona. Tienes a pocos minutos andando conexión con metro y la línea de Aerobus que te lleva en 15-20 minutos al aeropuerto.
Habitaciones amplias, con suficiente espacio para trabajar, cama muy confortable y las amenities propias de un hotel de esta categoría. Las salas de reuniones de un nivel muy alto. Desayuno buffet muy completo, variado, y con un repositorio constante.
Francamente muy recomendable. Eso sí, como suele pasar en Barcelona el importe de la estancia es elevado aunque comparado con otros hoteles de su categoría es una opción muy recomendable.

Opinión general: 9/10",5,2017,10,20
12,Buen Hotel,"Muy buen servicio, comida excelente, buena ubicación, cerca del metro y del parque Montjuic, caminando desde el hotel puedes llegar al museo de Joan Miró y el teleférico, cerca hay un restaurante chileno muy bueno, en fin me encantó alojarme en el hotel.",5,2017,10,17

12,"Buenas instalaciones, gran comida","Muy buena localización para asistir a congresos en el fire de Barcelona, fácil acceso a zonas de recreación y museos. Falta un poco en la atención, excelente comida y buenas instalaciones. Check in lento. ",4,2017,09,30
12,"Hotel di alto livello, ma mancano alcuni dettagli","Camera spaziosissima e ben arredata. Posizione perfetta a due passi da Placa Espana. 
Vista sul cortile interno non un gran che e vetri sporchi all'esterno. 
Niente spazzolino da denti nelle camere, acqua della vasca sempre tiepida, caffè espresso della colazione terribile",4,2017,09,24
12,Un hotel mas,"No puedo decir que sea un mal hotel, pero es de esos sitios que no te dejan huella ni te generan un recuerdo especialmente grato. La ubicación es muy buena, junto a la Fira, pero ni las habitaciones me parecieron demasiado agradables (esa decoración de hospital que se extiende al cuarto de baño no parece la mejor elección) ni el desayuno me dejó impresionado positivamente. Todo bien, sin más. Pero es tranquilo y el trato es correcto, en general. Quizás un buen sitio para viajes de negocios, pero no tanto para un fin de semana romántico.",3,2017,09,10
12,Muy recomendable,"Fuimos de concierto al Palau St. Jordi y optamos por el Crown por su proximidad. Estupendo servicio, habitaciones amplias. Lástima el trato que recibimos del Spa, aunque no lo gestione directamente el hotel, forma parte de sus servicios. Por lo demás, muy recomendable.",5,2017,08,17
12,Buon Hotel vicino al centro,"A soli 20 minuti dal centro di Barcellona e adiacente alla fiera e alla fontana di Montjac. Personale cordiale e parla anche italiano.
Ottima struttura con piscina al 7º piano per un po' di relax 
Ristorante X colazione e cena non utilizzate ma a vedere sembrava buono.
Camera ampia con divano e poltrona Grande TV e frigo bagno con ampia doccia e vasca Letti confortevoli King bed Un armadio grande.
Pulizia della camera non sempre efficace e meticolosa a volte non lasciavano L acqua o non c erano tutti gli asciugamani a volte non veniva pulito il piano del lavandino.",4,2017,08,11
12,Un business hotel di gran confort!,"Vicino a Plaza de España, un hotel molto grande, di stile business, con tutti i confort attesi. Buona cortesia, bella terrazza all'ultimo piano con vista Bcn, area fitness, ecc.. Ma soprattutto la camera, ciò che è più importante: grande, letto king size, doccia, vasca, TV gigantesco, divano, poltrona, scrivania.... insomma: c'è tutto! Da tornarci
Hotel de gran nivel, hay todo para salir satisfecho. Yo voy a volver!",4,2017,08,07
12,"De las mejores opciones, especialmente si vas de concierto a Montjuic","Es la tercera vez que me alojo en este Hotel para ir de concierto a Barcelona. Por ubicación, sin duda es la mejor opción por estar al lado del Palau Sant Jordi y el Estadio Olimpico. Lo más importante es la amabilidad y calidad del personal, eso se nota nada más entrar al hotel, de 10.Y, además, es un hotel excelente en todos los sentidos. 
Las habitaciones son inmensas y con unas camas de calidad icreible. Baños muy limpios y grandes, con una excelente ducha. Servicio de habitaciones muy bien de precio y de calidad.
Incluso tienes una nesperso en la habitación para poder tomarte un cafe!!
En resumen, seguiré acudiendo a este excelente hotel y recomendandolo a todo el que me pregunte por un alojamiento en Barcelona.",5,2017,07,24
12,hotel excelente,"Con motivo del concierto de U2 fuimos a pasar la noche por la proximidad del mismo, teniamos hecha la reserva desde el mes de febrero y a la hora del check out nos cobraban casi  200 euros ma, teniendo que demostrar el precio que salia en la reserva y por otro lado al haber overbooking y ser tres personas nos propusieron una junior suite.
Las habitaciones excelentes, amplias y muy limpias.
Probablemente por el evento se vieron desbordados",4,2017,07,22
12,excelente hotel,"Hotel excelente, ubicado muy cerca de Montjuic, limpio, agradable, trato muy bueno al llegar y durante la estancia. Desayuno con un gran surtido, habitaciones muy amplias y bien insonorizadas de ruido exterior. Muy recomendable, una elección segura para futuras visitas.
Podría mejorar en las almohadas, sería aconsejable que las dos que ponen no fuesen tan parecidas, recomendable distinta dureza y menos anchas una de ella.",5,2017,07,19
12,Muy buen hotel... aunque quizá un poco caro.,"Habitación super grande, enorme. Dos camas enormes. Muy Limpio. TV plasma gigante (con conexión a internet, smartv). 

El baño gigante, con ducha y bañera. Toallas muy buenas. Amenities correctas. Albornoces y zapatillas.

Armarios grandes. Una cafetera nespresso (eso sí, capsulas a 2,40€). Aunque té y café soluble de cortesía, así como un agua y unos carquiñolis :-)

Habitación silenciosa (tal y como había pedido). Las camas muy bien, sueño perfecto.

El personal muy amable y servicial. La situación estupenda (fuentes de Montjuic, Plaza España, Paralelo).

Lástima que sea un poquito caro (nuestra tarifa 140€ x noche x habitación sin desayuno)... pero es que últimamente los hoteles (tanto Barcelona como Madrid) se han puesto carísimos! Un poco más barato y repetíamos!",4,2017,07,19

12,Non c'era la piscina,"Siamo stati bene nel complesso ma siamo rimasti delusi dal fatto che non c'era la piscina disponibile (lo sarebbe stata tra 40 giorni) ma nel sito si diceva che c'era. La colazione la abbiamo pagata a parte perché non era inclusa nel prezzo ma devo dire che c'era di tutto in abbondanza

12,"Excelente, sin más","Habitación enorme, con todo lujo de comodidades. Carta de almohadas, servicio de habitaciones, minibar muy completo... Cerca de autobús y metro al aeropuerto.

12,De congreso en barcelona,"Hemos estado una semana de congreso en esta hotel y la atención del personal ha sido perfecta. Además, las instalaciones del hotel están pensadas específicamente para este tipo de eventos (fuimos más de 700 personas) y cuenta con servicios business que facilitan muchísimo poder coordinar y que la organización sea perfecta.

Además está muy bien situado en una zona céntrica, tranquila y con todos los servicios.",5,2017,06,12

12,Ottimo soggiorno ,"Abbiamo soggiornato 3 giorni in questo bellissimo hotel vicinissimo a piazza di Spagna dove c ' è la fermata dell ' aerobus che dall ' aeroporto ti porta a Barcellona e viceversa, quindi comodissimo, e ci siamo trovati veramente bene. 
Personale gentilissimo in reception, bella e pulita la camera, fornita di set cortesia in bagno e provvista di macchina del caffè nespresso in stanza, colazione spettacolare, c ' era davvero di tutto di più. 
Situato in zona tranquilla ma comodo per la visita della città sia a piedi che con i mezzi. Tra l'altro c ' era il servizio taxi proprio davanti all ' albergo, più comodo di così. 
Sicuramente ci ritornerei volentieri.

12,Hospedarse aquí fue maravilloso,"Toda la experiencia en este hotel fue impecable: las habitaciones son grandes, cómodas y limpias. El restaurante tiene un menú y buffet muy completo. Los salones de reuniones correctos, cuidando el detalle como contar con agua para los asistentes siempre. Wifi en todo el edificio, además gratis. Y el servicio impecable; amable, atento y el personal habla inglés. 
Me hospedé en este hotel por temas de trabajo (importante mencionarlo, porque no está precisamente cerca de los lugares icónicos de Barcelona)",5,2017,05,24
12,Gutes Business Hotel,"Ich war zu einer Konferenz im Crown Plaza und es war ein netter Aufenthalt. 
Das Zimmer war sehr groß und gut ausgestattet, mit einem für Hotels ungewöhnlich großem Badezimmer. 
Das Catering war ebenfalls von guter Qualität und abwechslungsreich. 
Jedoch war das Hotel zu der Zeit ausgebucht, was man vor allem beim Frühstück bemerkt hat. Im Frühstücksraum war es voll und laut.
Alles in allem kann das Hotel aber gut weiterempfohlen werden. ",4,2017,05,20

12,Excelente Spa,"Celebramos el cumple de mi chica disfrutando del Spa. Simplemente me pareció excelente. Estuvimos durante 90' en el circuito de aguas el cual es bastante completo. También tiene 3 tipos de sauna diferentes (seca, húmeda y otra además de pediluvio). Se nos pasó el tiempo volando. Después tuvimos masaje 30'. Espectacular!!!

Un hotel con una situación inmejorable, justo al lado de la Feria de Barcelona, muy cerca del Puerto y a menos de dos calles de la mejor gastronomía de Barcelona (Restaurante Tickets, Rías de Galicia y Bar Cañota.)

Además, las habitaciones son amplísimas, parece un 5 estrellas gran lujo pero a un precio muy asequible. Totalmente equipadas, no les falta ni un mínimo detalle. Espaciosas, camas gigantes y cómodas y recientemente reformadas.

El personal del hotel es amabilísimo y la limpieza es de 10.

12,Fallo importante del desayuno,"El hotel tiene todas las instalaciones de muy buena calidad y es muy confortable, pero el desayuno debido a su precio resulta decepcionante.
El mobiliario es de alta calidad asi como las instalaciones, el personal es amable sin mas.",3,2017,01,04
12,Perfetto per visitare la città,"Siamo rimasti estremamente soddisfatti del nostro soggiorno presso questa struttura. Al nostro arrivo ( in mattinata ) ci hanno fatto trovare la camera già pronta prima dell'orario canonico del check in. Viaggiando con un bambino avevamo bisogno di una sistemazione spaziosa e siamo stati accontentati . Un comodo ingresso con una parete armadio,un bagno con doccia e vasca e udite udite anche il bidet 
La stanza aveva 2 letti queen size,una comoda poltrona e un'altra stile frau 
Televisore gigante alla parete. Macchina nespresso,bollitore e frigobar ben fornito,una bottiglia di acqua come omaggio tutti i giorni.
La stanza era al primo piano ma vi posso assicurare che era davvero super silenziosa.
Pulizia eccellente. Letti e cuscini comodi. Buone anche le amenities tipo bagnoschiuma &co.
Colazione super fornita di ogni ben di Dio e disposta molto bene ed ordinata. Un plus va alla super macchina della Nespresso in sala per un ottimo caffè.
Il ristorante a mio avviso è un po' caro e una piccola nota di demerito va al maître che non parlava mezza parola di inglese ma solo spagnolo e francese ( e menomale che me la sono cavata) 
Un plauso a tutto il personale estremamente carino e disponibile. Anche alla reception hanno saputo aiutarci con tutte le nostre richieste.
Ve lo consiglio perché è in una bella zona di Barcellona vicino alla bella piazza di Spagna, alla fontana magica,al museo nazionale di arte contemporanea (MNAC) vicino alla fermata della metro e agli autobus turistici a 2 piani che portano in tutta la città,toccando le principali attrazioni. Consiglio poi a 2 passi un ottimo ristorante di Tapas ( via Paralel) che ha tra i soci il fratello del famoso Adrià.
Se tornerò a Barcellona sarà un piacere soggiornare nuovamente qui.",4,2017,01,02
12,Silvester in Barcelona,"Tolles Hotel. Zentrale Lage. Wir waren drei Tage hier. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung. Durchschnittliche Auswahl, wird sofort  nachgefüllt und schmeckt. Sauna hat entgegen unserer Info zusätzlich gekostet. Sauna und Pool für 15 € pro Person ziemlich teuer und lohnt nicht. Des Weiteren geht man mit Bikini in die Sauna. Badekappen müssen im Pool getragen werden, was jedoch nicht untypisch für Spanien ist.
Vor der Tür stehen immer mehrere Taxis und kleine Shops für Getränke usw. sind um die Ecke, sowie für die Raucher eine Tankstelle. 
Ebenfalls in der Nähe sind die Haltestellen für alle Busse.  Einige gut bewertete Restaurants befinden sich auch eine Straßen weiter.
Der Brunnen (Magic Fontaine) ist 5 Minuten zu Fuß und nicht nur zu Silvester zu empfehlen. Für den Jahreswechsel ein wunderschönes Spektakel. ",4,2017,01,01
12,Super zentrales Hotel,"Wir waren zufrieden. Das Hotel hat eine super Lage - Taxis stehen direkt vor dem Hotel und die Metro ist nur 5 min zu Fuß entfernt.

12,Tolles Hotel mit exzellenter Club-Lounge,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral direkt hinter dem Messegelände unterhalb des Montjuic. Zu Fuß sind Placa Espana, Nationalpalast mit den sehenswerten Springbrunnen und Olympiagelände zu erreichen. Mit der Buslinie 46 kommt man bequem ohne Umsteigen vom Flughafen zur Endstation Diagonal. Bei Buchung eines Club-Zimmers wird man vom sehr freundlichen Personal vom Empfang in die Club-Lounge begleitet, wo man gesondert eincheckt. Die Club-Lounge bietet einen außergewöhnlich hohen Standard, wie ich ihn so selbst in höher klassifizierten Hotels selten erlebt habe. Über den ganzen Tag stehen Softdrinks und alkoholische Getränke bereit. Zweimal am Tag werden warme und kalte Snacks bereitgestellt. Das Frühstück kann man im ruhigen Club-Frühstücksraum einnehmen, es bietet eine reichhaltige Auswahl an Speisen und Getränken. Die Zimmer sind sehr groß und zweckmäßig mit einem Arbeitsbereich, zwei bequemen Sesseln und bequemen Betten ausgestattet. Auch das Bad ist angenehm geräumig mit abgetrennten Kabinen für Dusche und WC sowie Badewanne und großem Waschbecken mit reichlich Ablagemöglichkeiten.

12,Muy buen hotel cerca de Plaza Espanya!,"Estuvimos a fines de octubre con mi marido y nos gusto mucho el hotel. Las habitaciones son espaciosas, modernas y muy lindas. En la habitación hay cafetera Nespresso pero cobran las cápsulas, algo que me pareció ridículo la verdad. Siendo un hotel de la categoría que es, deberían ser una atención a los huéspedes las cápsulas, sin costo alguno.
El desayuno es muy caro y caótico, gente corriendo a servirse por todos lados, ensaladas que parecían preparadas los días anteriores (los vegetales no eran frescos) y pocas opciones vegetarianas. Sólo tomé el desayuno un día porque me pareció que no valía la pena. 
El hotel cuenta con una zona de spa y piscina que está más o menos bien, aunque esperaba más, sobre todo siendo que no está incluído su precio y hay que pagar 15 euros extra por persona. Esto debería estar incluído para todos los huéspedes, me pareció patético tener que pagar para acceder a una piscina que encima era muy pequeña para poder nadar.
La ubicación está bien y, en resumen, hemos pasado una muy buena estancia. 
El personal del hotel ha sido muy amable y no dudaron en hacernos el check in incluso al llegar a la mañana al hotel.",4,2016,11,12

12,Bellissimo e ottima posizione,"Hotel bellissimo, di alta fascia e con camere e servizi accessori di livello. La posizione è perfetta sia per chi lo sceglie per lavoro (vicino alla fiera, ben collegato con i vari mezzi pubblici e flotta di taxi sempre presente fuori dall'ingresso), sia per chi vuole concedersi il meglio per un soggiorno turistico. Anche dall'aeroport El Prat il collegamento con Aerobus da Plaza de Espanya è ottimo. Nei dintorni ci sono un sacco di locali (zona Montjuic e Poble Sec) e anche Raval e Ramblas sono a portata. Non costa poco, come tutte le cose che hanno valore, ma il prezzo è adeguato.",5,2016,10,15
12,Centrale e ben collegato,Ottima posizione per centralità e vicinanza all'aeroporto. Ci si può muovere a piedi agevolmente. Buono il servizio con aerobus per raggiungerlo dall'aeroporto. Camere spaziose e di buon livello. Buona la colazione. Personale cortese.,4,2016,10,14
12,Magnífico,"Experiencia de 2 adultos en viaje de negocios (feria BCN). Habitaciones amplias, servicios y detalles excelentes. A 5min de plaza España andando (queda justo detrás). Sala business center con ordenadores nuevos con internet gratuito y servicio de impresión también gratuito, me sorprendió positivamente. Decoración moderna y amplitud en los espacios. Nos atendió una mujer rubia (Judith creo recordar) muy amable y simpática que resolvió nuestras dudas y nos ayudó en todo lo que pedimos. En el check out preguntamos sobre el Spa a otra chica, que nos dió mal una información. Pero rápidamente su compañero le corrigió y ella se disculpó y nos confirmó esa información por teléfono con el Spa.

12,Muy bueno,"Muy buen hotel. Es el antiguo Fira. Habitaciones amplias, limpias y completas, te ofrecen agua y tienes nespresso y hasta nesquick si quieres tomar algo calentito. Tan solo algo desmerecedor el desayuno, poco variado, y solo una tostadora en toda la sala, por lo que más vale que el desayuno se haga con tiempo. 
También deben de poner toallas algo más grandes en el baño y albornoces al menos uno de talla grande",4,2016,09,27
12,Impresionante,"Buff, poco que decir. Mi empresa reservo una estancia de una noche en este hotel, porque no había más sitio por la zona y desde luego, espectacular. Cama de 2m de ancho, sillón, televisión Samsung de más de 45"", acceso a la planta A con desayuno, tentempiés y bebidas según horario, Spa,...

En fin, de maravilla. Las habitaciones super limpias, silenciosas y muy cómodas.",5,2016,09,26

12,Super Hotel!,"Das Hotel liegt nicht mitten im Zentrum, ist aber vom Flughafen aus sehr rasch erreichbar und man ist sehr rasch bei den olympischen Anlagen am Mont Juic. Das Stadtzentrum ist per Metro rasch erreichbar. 

Check-in: sehr freundlich, mir wurde mitgeteilt, dass wir als Spire-Member Zugang zur Clublounge haben würden (das war etwas speziell, schliesslich hatten wir schon Club gebucht - unter dem Strich also kein Upgrade....). Wir wurden dann direkt in die Clublounge gebracht, wo das Checkin abgeschlossen wurde.

Das Zimmer war recht gross, mit einem schönen Bad, einem bequemen Sessel, einem riesigen TV mit grosser Senderauswahl und einer Nespresso-Kaffemaschine. Schade war einzig, dass das Zimmer eher dunkel war. Aber in Barcelona verbringt man sowieso nicht allzuviel Zeit im Zimmer.

Clublounge: Absolut top! Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig und qualitativ sehr gut. Das entspricht definitiv schon dem Standard eines Intercontinental-Hotels. Ebenfalls überdurchschnittlich das Angebot am Abend. Champagner gab es den ganzen Tag (also von 07-23 Uhr), und zwar ""richtigen"" Champagner, nicht einfach Sekt. Das kriegt kaum ein Intercontinental Hotel hin. Ich war begeistert von der Clublounge.

Einmal nutzte ich am Morgen das sehr modern ausgerüstete Fitness-Center. Auch hier war ich positiv überrascht. Im Vorbeigehen sah ich den sehr schönen Pool (Indoor), welchen ich allerdings aus Zeitgründen nicht nutzte.

Fazit: ein wirklich tolles Haus, praktisch schon auf dem Level eines Intercontinental!",5,2016,09,17
12,"Perfetto, lontano dal caos","Hotel ben posizionato, vicino a tutti i principali mezzi pubblici di trasporto. Le Ramblas sono tranquillamente raggiungibili anche a piedi con una - non proprio cortissima - passeggiata. Le camere sono grandi, il letto comodo, il wi-fi è compreso. Colazione ottima, c'è di tutto (attenzione che non è compresa nella tariffa della camera standard). In pochi minuti a piedi si raggiunge il Montjuic. Nelle vicinanze diversi locali per cenare e anche parecchi bar dove gustare degli ottimi panini. Hotel consigliato anche per viaggi di lavoro.",4,2016,09,14
12,Magnifico,"Alloggio in questo hotel ogni anno in Settembre per lavoro. Il prezzo è totalmente giustificato dai servizi e dalla bellezza di questo hotel. Stanze molto grandi, Bagno con doccia e vasca, tutto pulitissimo e ben tenuto, possibilità di accedere alla spa con un piccolo supplemento. il personale è gentilissimo e molto disponibile. Preferiscono parlare inglese piuttosto che spagnolo, ma sono catalani quindi è naturale........
uscendo dall'hotel in pochi minuti si raggiunge il Palazzo Reale coi suoi splendidi giardini, da qui si può andare su per Montjuic oppure fare un giro al centro commerciale Arena dalle cui terrazze si gode di una magnifica vista sulla città. con la metro (2 fermate vicine all'hotel) poi si raggiungono facilmente le principali attrazioni della città. insomma l'hotel oltre che bello è anche comodo ai mezzi pubblici. nelle vicinanze poi si trovano tanti locali tipici dove poter cenare.",5,2016,09,13
12,Impeccabile,"Posizione strategica, in una zona semi-centrale presso il vecchio quartiere fieristico dell'Expo storico di inizio 900. Zona animatissima, ma le camere sono molto silenziose. C'è tutto, anche la macchinetta del Nexpresso. Personale cortese, parlano un discreto italiano. Colazione OK e ben organizzata (eravamo un gruppo di oltre 60 persone e non abbiamo sofferto alcun disagio. Bello anche il poter fare due passi dopo cena in un quartiere molto interessante.",4,2016,09,13
12,Spettacolare,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo per motivi di lavoro, le camere sono molto spaziose, ben arredate con letti davvero molto comodi per dormire, il wi fi funzionava molto bene ed il servizio di pulizia delle camere è stato molto efficiente.

12,Ottima sistemazione,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel 5 notti nel mese di agosto. Ottima sistemazione. Camera grande, moderna, funzionale, confortevole, pulita e silenziosa. Mega televisore, grande armadio, asse e ferro da stiro, piani di appoggio. Bagno grande, molto pulito, con doccia e vasca separate. Accogliente e gentile il personale. Moderni  e puliti gli spazi comuni. Unica pecca: 2 letti da una piazza e mezza e noi eravamo in 3 (una coppia e un'adolescente). Buona l'ubicazione, a 5 minuti da Plaza Espanya dove si trova la fermata della metropolitana che in poche fermate porta nel centro della città. A piedi, in una mezz'ora, si può arrivare alla Rambla. Nel complesso un ottimo hotel che consiglio vivamente a che vuole visitare questa bellissima città.",5,2016,09,04
12,Hotel di ottimo livello per turisti e persone in viaggio d'affari,"Siamo stati qui 6 notti da turisti, alloggiati nelle camere del primissimo piano, l'ammezzato potremmo definirlo. Camere ben arredate, sempre pulite e ben rifinite. Una attenzione particolare al cliente, tante forniture tra cui shampo e bagnoschiuma separati in bagno seppur ci fosse anche il dispenser, ed il kit ""this works: sleep"" contenente nebulizzatore a base di lavanda e camomilla ed una crema a base di incenso ed eucalipto, mai capitato in tanti hotel anche con più stelle dove siamo stati!
Per il resto dotazioni in camera standard Crowne Plaza con angolo caffè (Nespresso), tea, dolcetti e bottiglietta di acqua gratis tutti i giorni.
Tutto questo ed eravamo alla fine in una camera deluxe, solo un livello sopra la camera doppia standard. 
L'hotel dispone anche di una piscina che abbiamo solo visitato di sfuggita (non fate come noi, portatevi dietro un costume ed andateci almeno una volta!), sale conferenze ed una lounge riservata.
Ottima la colazione con ampia scelta di piatti salati e dolci, alcuni dei quali variano di giorno in giorno. 
Wifi gratuito senza limiti (alla connessione dà un limite di 3 giorni, ma poi si rinnova automaticamente), servisse lavorare su computer e stampare c'è il Business Centre a cui hanno accesso tutti i clienti.
Infine un cenno alla posizione: eccezionale per visitare tutta la zona del Montjuïc (con un po' di sforzo si può arrivare al castello senza nemmeno prendere i mezzi pubblici). La vicina plaça d'Espania è capolinea e fermata di moltissimi mezzi pubblici tra cui la metropolitana e l'Aerobus per l'aeroporto.",5,2016,09,04
12,Ottimo albergo,"Comodo, vicino alla fiera e Plaza Cataluna e da altre attrazioni. Pulito e confortevole, personale gentilissimo.

12,Top Hotel ,"Dieses Hotel ist absolut empfehlenswert. Nahe dem Brunnen mit Musikshow. 
Es liegt auch nahe dem Einkaufszentrum Arenas, da kann man schön bummeln und etwas essen. Die Aussicht vom Zentrum ist auch sehr schön. 
Das Frühstück war für den Preis zu teuer. Einmal ausprobiert, war aber nichts besonders. 
Lieber in den Bäckerein gefrühstückt. Ist sehr lecker, frischer O-Saft und Toasts.
Und abends meistens in Tapas-Bars gegessen. 
Das Hotel würde ich immer wieder buchen. ",5,2016,08,26

12,Fin de semana de escapada urbana y relax,"Fuimos a pasar un fin de semana (dos noches) a Barcelona y nos alojamos en este hotel. Tuvimos la suerte que coincidiendo con nuestra estancia en Barcelona, estaban programados los espectáculos de las funetes de Montjuïc las dos noches, por lo que pudimos disfrutar del show. 
La habitación del hotel era confortable y muy grande (unos 40m2). Lo mejor: la cama king size y el espacio de la habitación que nos hizo sentir como en un apartamento entero para nosotros. El personal de recepción es muy atento y amable.
En la zona hay parquing GRATUITO, por lo que no es necesario pagar zona azul o parking en el hotel. Es muy fácil aparcar en las proximidades.

El hotel se encuentra en la zona de Montjuïc, en el Paralelo. Hasta el Raval hay unos 15minutos andando y si queréis ir hasta el Borne y el Gótico, tenéis unos 30 minutos como mucho a pie, pero está bien hacer este paseo para conocer las calles de Barcelona y su gente.",5,2016,08,09
12,A TÍTULO INFORMATIVO,"-Nos hospedamos la semana pasada para ir al concierto de Beyoncé. La ubicación del sitiio es muy buena, las camas individuales son enormes y muy cómodas; se corresponde con las fotos de la web. Hay metro y autobus a menos de 10 minutos. 
-A nuestra llegada al hotel la recepcionista no sabía si el spa tenía circuito o no, el horario... y además estaba más interesada en la conversación de sus compañeras que en atendernos. Después a recepcionista del spa fue muy amable y eficiente. El horario del spa es muy amplio y el gimnasio moderno y en buen estado. 
-Lo reservamos con una promoción. Con el precio normal, un poquito caro para toda la competencia que hay alrededor.
 El desayuno carísimo...

Il servizio di alto livello è stato ottimo durante tutta la permanenza. Prima di tornare in Italia però ci hanno avvisato del fatto che fossimo in ritardo per il check out.

12,Preis Leistung ist ok - Betten sind super!,"Wir waren zu zweit dort im Juni. Das Hotel ist an einer schönen Lage ein bisschen weg vom Zentrum was mit einem Taxi jedoch unproblematisch ist. Zur Metro ist es auch nicht weit, ca. 7 min zu Fuss. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sehr ruhig und ein grosser Pluspunkt ist der grosse Fernseher. Die Betten gefallen mir am besten an diesem Hotel! Die sind super weich und bequem. Das negativste sind die knastähnlichen Fenster. Es gibt viel zu wenig Tageslicht im Zimmer. Ausserdem waren wir zu zweit, es wurde die ganzen 5 Tage jedoch immer nur Kaffe und Wasser für eine Person bereitgestellt was ich für einen Preis von über 400CHF pro Nacht als sehr mangelhaft empfand. Obwohl wir jeden Tag ein zweites Wasser/Kaffe bestellt haben wurde das während den nächsten Tageb nicht angemessen gehandhabt. Wir mussten jeden Tag extra verlangen. Das schlimmste fand ich dass wir vom Personal nicht darüber informiert wurden dass am Ankunftstag das San Juan Festival stattfand! Aufgrund einer spontanreise wussten wir nich dass es UNMÖGLICH ist an diesem Fest von der  Stadt aus ein Taxi zu bekommen! Es wäre angebracht die Gäste darüber zu informieren. Es ist absolut nicht zu empfehlen während dieses Festivals ausserhalb der Stadt zu übernachten.",3,2016,07,09

Albornoz incluido y toallas de todos los tamaños siempre a disposición. Tienen en el Altillo, planta A, restaurante  donde puedes tener acceso a comida y bebida hasta las 23:00, el desayuno también se puede tomar allí o bien en la planta baja, precio incluido con la habitación. Solo un comentario, si cuelgas de la puerta de la habitación el colgador para que la limpien, este de cara No molestar o cara opuesta, si esta puesto no pasan a hacer la habitación. Luego si quieres que no te molesten cuélgalo, pero sino,no pongas nada. Todo genial para repetir.",5,2016,06,07

Las tres saunas son públicas y están bien diseñadas, al igual que la piscina, que debo decir que es la primera que me encuentro en la que funciona todo el circuito. Un ambiente relajante, de los mejores ne los que he estado. Decorado con mucho estilo y en uno de los hoteles más elegantes de la ciudad. Las pegas: había una baldosa suelta (que ya vimos en comentarios de otros viajeros que ya estaba, por lo que lleva meses sin arreglar) y el personal poco eficiente (no tenían anotada nuestra reserva y aun así nos dejaron pasar reconociendo su culpa y luego no me canviaron dinero para la taquilla).

12,OTTIMO,"Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti nel periodo di Pasqua. All'inizio ci siamo trovati in difficoltà in quanto abbiamo prenotato per 2 adulti e 1 ragazzo di 12 anni e ci è stata consegnata una stanza con due letti a mezza piazza ciscuano. Era impensabile dormirci in 3 e loro non avevano il letto da aggiungere. Ci è stata proposta una soluzione molto carina. Con 75 euro in più a camera per una suite e accesso alla Lounge riservata. Devo dire che siamo rimasti piacevolmente sorpresi. La quota includeva la colazione (che da sola costa intorno al 20 euro a persona) e tapas a tutte le ore del giorno, più caffè, bibite, dolci, vini, birra, stuzzichini,champagne e superalcolici! Davvero comodo!
La SPA dell'hotel è molto carina, ma secondo me le operatrici non sono all'altezza. Durante il trattamento al viso che è durato 1 ora, la ragazza è uscita 2 volte a fumare per poi respirarmi in faccia con la puzza delle sigarette. Inammissibile. La piscine e le zone umide molto belle, anche se ci sono solo 6 lettini di numero, direi un po' pochi. Hotel si trova vicino alla piazza di Spagna, a 200 m dalle famose fontane. Una mattina siamo arrivati in centro a piedi, ci sono voluti 20 minuti. Ci siamo spostati sempre in taxi, fino alla Rambla sono 6/7 euro. Hotel consigliato, ambienti molto belli e  camere nuove e accoglienti, piano bar di sera .L'unica pecca a parte la SPA, sono le cameriere che cominciano ad urlare di prima mattina (già dalle 7,30) e a bussare alla porta. Se volete essere lasciati in pace almeno fino alle 9, ricordatevi di mettere il cartello sulla porta, certo questo non vi salverà comunque dalle loro urla!",5,2016,04,06
12,"hotel davvero perfetto , nulla da eccepire","Abbiamo scelto questa struttura grazie ad internet ma non ci aspettavamo che fosse così soddisfacente sotto tutti gli aspetti . Camera spaziosa , molto pulita , luminosa e confortevole ,letti comodi e morbidissimi cuscini e poi , non solo all'arrivo ma ogni giorno , abbiamo trovato biscottini  croccanti e bottiglietta d'acqua e , prima di sera, una dolce gustosa sorpresa sul cuscino .Nel bagno doccia e vasca e ottimi prodotti per la persona. La colazione molto ricca , buffet internazionale e dolci ottimi. Il personale sempre molto disponibile , cortese e sorridente ha completato il tutto.Insomma un ottimo ricordo di questa splendida città",5,2016,04,01
12,ottimo hotel in zona tranquilla di Barcellona,"Ottimo hotel per business ma non solo.  Camere grandissime, silenziose e pulite, bella l’illuminazione e l’arredamento.

El personal muy amable, educado y servicial, dispone de bar, gimnasio etc. Realmente vale la pena pagar un poco mas para recibir todo esto.",5,2016,03,23
12,Fantástico,"Hotel moderno destinado a clientes de negocios pero que para una familia colma también todos los requisitos. Pese a que no está situado en el centro, está perfectamente conectado. Además tiene al lado la Fuente de Montjuic, si bien me decepcionó bastante (y la peque tampoco es que disfrutase en exceso). Las habitaciones son muy grandes, con una televisión de soltero (vamos, gigante). Cogimos una buena oferta que tenía incluido el servicio Club, y merecía la pena. A destacar el desayuno, con platos calientes variados y servicio de bollería realmente excelente. Respecto al personal, todo positivo; muy amables y sin ser intrusivos en ningún momento. Por otro lado, tiene detalles curiosos que no había visto antes (por ejemplo, te dan un spray para echar en las almohadas y facilitar el sueño). En resumen, fantástica experiencia, con un precio realmente competitivo en una ciudad en la que los precios no son precisamente bajos.",5,2016,03,22

12,Buen hotel,"El hotel está bien ubicado muy limpio, con habitaciones grandes y con camas queen. El desayuno es bueno y disponen de máquinas de hielo en cada planta. Solo un problema con el spa que la chica no sabía muy bien cómo funcionaba el tema de los puntos de ihg. Pero en general todo bien.",5,2016,02,19
12,Muy recomendable,"Situado muy cerca de las fuentes de Montjuic este hotel tal vez parezca un gigante más bien dedicado a los profesionales de ferias y negocios. Nosotros elegimos el hotel principalmente para estar cerca del Teatre Lliure para ver una obra, y acertamos de lleno para disfrutar de una salida en pareja. Las habitaciones comodísimas y silenciosas. La sala Club ofrece check-in exclusivo, atendido por personal muy amable, y con snacks y bebidas de calidad que valen mucho la pena. Desayuno muy correcto. No pudimos probar la zona de aguas que estaba cerrada por mantenimiento. Es una muy buena opción para cualquier tipo de viajero que prefiere un hotel grande y moderno en una zona alejada de centro, pero bien comunicado y con muchos atractivos. Buen parking apto para vehículos de cualquier tamaño (pagar en recepción del hall para aprovechar el descuento por estar alojados)",5,2016,02,18
12,Viaje de negocios,"Viaje con motivo de una feria . En todo momento me encontré agusto con la habitación y con el servicio. Parada de taxis en la puerta . Habitaciones limpias y amplias. Muy confortables. Es dinero pero en mi opinión bien pagado

12,"ENORME, PULITO, COMODO","Ho recentemente alloggiato in questa struttura rinnovata non da molto. Ci avevo alloggiato anno fa quando era sotto altra gestione, e l'ho trovata migliorata.
Camere ampie, comode, pulite e silenziose. Ottima la pulizia anche del bagno e delle parti comuni.
Particolarmente celere il servizio in camera per la colazione.
Anche la Spa è di buon livello.
Dispone di una quantità infinita di camere e non dista molto dalle Ramblas.
Discreta la ristorazione e la zona business e congressi.",5,2016,01,22
12,Recepción de 10,"Lo primero que tengo que comentar es el excelente trato que me hicieron en la recepción del hotel. Por un error mio reserve el día anterior a mi llegada. Cuando llegue a recepción me dijeron que mi reserva ya había sido cobrada y que no tenía habitación. Procedieron a conseguirme habitación y además me pasaron el cargo de la noche anterior a la que disfruté teniendo sólo que pagar extra un día de tasa municipal (espero que el ayuntamiento de Barcelona haga buen uso de mi euro )

Por otro lado la habitación me pareció muy buena y lo único es que la que me toco tenía vistas al edificio de enfrente.",4,2016,01,22
12,Volver a Barcelona y volver al Fira Center,"Hotel con condiciones altamente aceptables.
Las habitaciones de buen tamano, con todo lo necesario para estar comodos, accesorios en general que complementan el confort.
El bano de primera, todo funciona, todo bien mantenido. Muy lindo el equipamiento en el bano.
El desayuno excelente, completo y mas que suficiente. Buena atencion y buena calidad de los alimentos.
Muy agradable el trato de recepcion , atentos, con buena disposicion.
Muy bueno el bussines center, con computadoras disponibles en todo momento.
Los espacios comunes de estar, comedor, y servicios esta muy bien planteado y excelentemente equipado.
La ubicacion, aceptable, a metros de Montjuic, caminando te vas hasta la parada de subte y en 10'estas en la Plaza de Catalunia.
Genial. Volver a Barcelona y alojarse de nuevo en el Fira. Seguro!",4,2016,01,20
12,Las habitaciones excelentes la comida decepcionante,"Estuve dos dias, asistiendo a una convención. Tengo que decir que las salas son estupendas pero en el desayuno se desbordaron, en las comidas se quedaron escasos y fue repetitiva y la cena que hicimos en el mismo hotel fue un poco decepcionate. 
Teniamos barra libre y aprobechaban los restos de refrescos para ir completando otras copas, es la primera vez que veo algo asi",2,2016,01,18
12,Lo consiglio,"Ho trascorso quattro giorni in questa struttura con la mia famiglia . Ottimo albergo stanze grandi e ben arredate. Personale gentile ed efficiente. Colazione ottima ma non economica ( 16 euro ).

12,"Schönes Hotel, passende Ausgangslage für Barcelona","Aktuell haben wir hier drei Tage mit Kind übernachet. Das Hotel Personal ist sehr aufmerksam und kümmert sich um die Gäste. Die Zimmer sind auf jeden Fall groß, modern und sauber. Man kann sich hier wohlfüheln und schön Erholungspausen nach den Besichtigungen machen. Eine Metro ist in der Nähe, vor dem Hotel warten aber auch immer Taxifahrer. Das Taxifahren ist in Barcelone preislich günstig bis in Ordnung. Die Gegend um das Hotel ist sicher und ruhig. In der Nähe befindet sich der Magische Brunnen mit abendlicher Lichtshow, gegenüber ist ein kleiner Supermarkt.
Im Hotel gibt es Gebührenpflichtig Wellness und Frühstück. Frühstück ist auf jeden Fall gut, was man aber für 18 Euro pro Person erwarten darf. Internet und Wifi sind gut. Auf jeden Fall ein gutes Hotel mit klasser Lage!",4,2015,12,26
12,Excepcional se queda corto,"Ha sido una gran sorpresa, encontrar un hotel tan tranquilo, el servicio excepcional, un trato exquisito, las habitaciones son de lo más cómodas y prácticas. Nos encanto todas las comodidades, cafetera, calienta aguas, sofá, mesa de escritorio, y el kit de aromaterapia para dormir y la cama tan cómoda hicieron unas noches de lo más relajantes. Uno de los mejores hoteles donde he descansado. ",5,2015,12,22
12,Excelente hotel y gran servicio,Junto a mi familia pasamos un par de dias  en este hotel. Es muy elegante y moderno. Excelente desayuno y muy amplio y comodo. Lejano al ruido y muy buen precio para la calidad del hotel. Sin duda regresaré. La belleza de Barcelona se disfrutó mucho mas con un hotel como este.,5,2015,12,20
12,Muy bueno,"Estuve aquí por una convención de trabajo, la habitación perfecta amplia, buena cama, la ducha muy buena y un gran televisor; realmente excelente. Las salas muy bien distribuidas, le falta terminar las reformas del hall, pero van en muy buen camino. Las copas en el bar bastante caras para la ubicación y estilo del lugar.",4,2015,12,20
12,"Siempre, como en casa","A lo largo de veintitrés años el hotel ha cambiado bastante, pero mantiene, incluso supera, su excelente nivel. Tranquilo, limpio, espacioso, cómodo. El Smart TV de las habitaciones es todo un espectáculo. Lo mejor sin duda, la calidez en el trato de todo el personal, que nos hace sentir al menos como en casa. Por poner una pequeña objeción: debería cuidar más las ofertas, aunque comprendo que dependen de la ocupación en determinadas fechas.",5,2015,12,11
12,Siempre fantastico,"Sin duda mi hotel favorito cuando tengo que dormir en Barcelona ciudad
Siempre con compañeros extranjeros que se sorprenden de la calidad en comparación de sus ciudades de origen (Milan, Paris, Hamburgo...)

Desayuno modesto pero nuevamente personal muy atento.
",4,2015,11,30
12,Comodo y moderno,"Me he alojado 4 noches en este hotel. Situado en una zona tranquila, a unos 7 minutos caminando desde la plaza de españa. Alli llegas en autobus desde el aeropuerto en 15 minutos y por solo 10,20€ ida y vuelta. En la plaza tienes metro. Situado cerca de las fuentes de montjuic y museo de arte, vale la pena ir.
La recepcion correcta, con personal amable. 
La habitacion muy grande, unos 20 metros y comoda. Muy bien aislada, pues la mia estaba frente al ascensor y no se oia nada.
Equipada con gran cama, unos 2 metros. Televisor de 50 pulgadas. Sillon relax. Detalle de cortesia diario, con botellin de agua, cafe, galletas, chocolatinas, tes. Que eran gratis, cosa que no hay en los hoteles. Una cosa que no he visto nunca, un spray de liquido relajante para echar en la almohada.
Cuarto de baño muy grande y aislado de la habitacion. Bien equipado y con bañera y ducha.
El bufet del desayuno muy bueno, variado, zumo natural, embutidos, bolleria, todo reciente y abundante. Un 9 sobre 10.
Un muy buen hotel al que yo volveria.
Aunque no todo es perfecto:
- la habitacion la hacian muy tarde, y eso que la dejaba para las 8:30. Muchos dias la hacian a partir de las 15:00 y un dia tube que reclamar pues a las 16:15 horas, no estaba hecha.
- un detalle muy desagradable. A los dias de mi vuelta, me doy cuenta que me han cargado una cantidad en mi tarjeta de credito. Al llamarles para pedir explicaciones, me cuentan que me han cobrado una cosa del minibar, patatas fritas??? Como les demuestro yo que no he cogido nada??? Llevo mas de 30 años viajando y nunca me habia pasado esto. El minibar de los hoteles ni se toca...Me parece lamentable.
Este feo detalle, les baja mi nota media a un 7/10.",4,2015,11,30
12,MODERNO Y FUNCIONAL HOTEL,"Elegante y funcional hotel en la zona de la feria de Barcelona. Habitaciones grandes y muy bien equipadas, con gran pantalla de smartTV, sillón de descanso y baño funcional y elegante. Muchos buenos detalles, albornoz etc... Muy buen desayuno y excepcionales áreas comunes para el desarrollo de una reunión de trabajo. La zona tiene algunos restaurantes y parece tranquila. El centro está a 5 munutos en taxi. Muy recomendable.",5,2015,11,29
12,prezzo eccessivo,"Ci siamo stati a settembre.
La vicinanza alla fontana magica è ottima.
Comunque è molto caro e dovrebbero iniziare a ristrutturare per mantenere lo standard.
In due minuti si arriva all'entrata della metro e facilmente si raggiunge il centro.
Il posto è tranquillo.Davanti l'hotel ci sono i taxi.
La colazione non l'abbiamo inclusa 20.00 euro è cara.
Siamo rimasti in ogni caso contenti l'hotel è bellissimo.",5,2015,11,27

Cerca del  la estacion tren y con buena comunicacion con el aeropuerto.",5,2015,11,17
12,Fin de semana en pareja ,Buen hotel en general y estubimos muy bien. Tanto la habitacion como el baño muy grandes. La única queja es que nuestro baño podria haber estado un poco mas limpio... El desayuno buffet bueno pero a lo mejor le faltaba un poco mas d cantidad-variedad...,4,2015,11,11

12,Eccessivo nel prezzo,"Scomodo per il centro, imperfetto nell'organizzazione, eccessivo nel prezzo. NnLe camere nelle quali ancora s'intravedono i segni di un passato glorioso ""troppo passato"" accusano l'affaccio sulla strada (5 piano). Insufficiente la SPA.",1,2015,10,30
12,Curso diferente," Espléndido servicio, ninguna queja. Quizás un poco peor por poner un pero, el desayuno bufet, aunque es de muy buena calidad lo he encontrado un poco flojo en variedad y cantidad.

12,schönes Haus in zentrumsnaher Lage,"Sehr geräumige Zimmer, modern und geschmackvoll, schönes Spa! Frühstück könnte verbessert werden (Speisen waren nicht richtig heiß).

La habitación muy buena, muy grande, dos camas grandes, aunque hemos pedido una de matrimonio no ha podido ser,  aunque en una ocasión anterior que estuvimos la habitación fue aún mejor, una cama de matrimonio enorme. 
El desayuno muy variado, y como es habitual en esto tipo de hoteles de ciudad, la leche y el café te lo sirve el camarero. Cuanto a esto si que hay una pequeña pega, o vienen todos o no viene nadie, y los tienes que llamar. 
El spa, pequeño pero muy limpio y completo.
En general nos ha gustado mucho, lo aconsejamos y lo repetiríamos.",4,2015,10,14

12,Ottimo hotel colazione cara,"Questo hotel è splendido, comodo nei trasporti e in poco tempo si arriva dall'aeroporto principale, pulitissimo, letto favoloso!

Zona tranquila y a pocos minutos de Sants.
Parada de taxi en la puerta.
Destaca el tamaño de la habitación, espaciosa y confortable.
Baño limpio y cama grande y cómoda.
No se oía nada por la noche, agradable para descansar.
Mi única pega es respecto un cambio respecto a los días. Lo hice a través de una web de viajes y tuve que pagar una noche extra al no dejarme modificar un lunes por un miércoles.
Desde luego que es la última vez que lo hago sin posibilidad de cambio, pero el precio se elevaba muchísimo.
Llamé a los de la web y al propio hotel y nadie hizo nada por cambiarlo. Lo tendré en cuenta también para futuras reservas.
Salvo este problema, el precio está acorde con lo ofrecido (eso si, si le sumas el extra de poder modificar días se sube a la parra)",4,2015,06,21
12,Top Hotel als Ausgangspunkt für Barcelona Sightseeing,"Wir haben drei Nächte in diesem Hotel verbracht. 
Beim Einchecken wurden wir sehr freundlich empfangen und es wurde in Ruhe alles wichtige  erklärt. 
Wir hatten eine Suite auf dem Executive Floor gebucht. Hier ist die Nutzung der Executive Lounge inklusive. Diese ist recht gut bestückt und dort erhält man Frühstück und Snacks sowie sämtliche Getränke bis zu Moet et Chandon Champagner. Wir waren fast immer die einzigen Gäste in der Lounge was sehr entspannt war.

Die Suite war sehr modern und sauber mit einem schönen Ausblick über die Stadt.
Das Bett war sehr groß und für unseren Geschmack sehr bequem, sodass wir herrlich und lange schlafen konnten. Auch sonst war alles vorhanden was man erwarten kann, Bademantel, Schläppchen Nespresso Maschine, sowie getrennt regelbare Klimaanlage für Wohn- und Schlafbereich. Ebenso der obligatorische Gute Nacht Gruß zum turn down service

Einen Abend hatten wir auch im Hotelrestaurant gegessen. Auch hier waren wir freudig überrascht. Die Qualität und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis waren hervorragend.

Für unseren nächsten Besuch im September 2015 haben wir wieder gebucht ",5,2015,06,21
12,Muy aconsejable,"Me parece un muy buen hotel dada su situación, detalles y acomodo con respecto al precio. De verdad, muy recomendable. La oferta por la zona es bastante amplia, pero este hotel, limpio y tranquilo, a pesar de lo transitado que está, se adecúa a las necesidades de todo viaje de negocios.",4,2015,06,15

12,Molto bello e confortevole,"Appena rientrata dal mio viaggio a Barcellona, con gli occhi ancora pieni di emozione e colori, mi accingo a recensire questo meraviglioso albergo. Posizione ottima, si trova a pochi passi dalla fontana magica del MontJiuc e di conseguenza a pochi passi da piazza di Spagna, quindi a parte la bellezza di questi posti l'ubicazione dell'albergo è veramente ottima perchè vicino vi sono varie fermate dei bus (uno tra i tanti il 46 che con 2.15 € ti porta in 30 minuti all'areoporto di El Prat, poi c'è la metropolitana, l'arena (piccolo centro commerciale con tanti ristorantini). Quindi ribadisco posizione ottima, il personale molto cordiale sia alla reception che nella sala delle colazioni. Passiamo alla stanza, avevo preso una matrimoniale con letto king size, stanza bellissima, molto spaziosa, letto bello, grande e comodo, all'interno della stanza c'è un armadio capiente, poltrona di pelle per il relax, bagno molto grande sia con vasca che con doccia, asciugacapelli, saponi,  tutto pulito ed ordinato, frigo bar grande...insomma la stanza era accessoriata e confortevole. I buffet per la colazione erano molto ricchi, si spazia con buffet salati dove si possono trovare uova sode, strapazzate, club sandwich, patate, verdure, formaggi, salumi e tanto altro, per chi preferisce il dolci c'erano varie tipologie di lieviti, delle torte, muffin, yogurt, cereali etc...succhi di frutta sia industriali che non. Insomma mi posso ritenere veramente soddisfatta del nostro soggiorno. p.s.: ovviamente non si tratta di un albergo low cost, credo che i prezzi siano in linea con gli altri alberghi dello stesso livello e categoria.",5,2015,06,11
12,Buen descaso,"Habitación amplia. Gran cama con buen colchón, facilitando el descanso. El trato por parte del personal es agradable. Desayuno buffet en línea con los hoteles de esta categoría, variedad y calidad.
A un paso de Sants y de la plaza de España. 
Como única pega diría que al entrar al baño se percibía un fuerte olor a tubería, siendo también cierto que desde la cama, al haber dos puertas de por medio, no se apreciaba.",4,2015,05,08
12,impresionante!,"Ya sabia que crowne plaza era un hotel de calidad, pero su estancia me ha sorprendido aun mas! increible en todos los aspectos, desde el trato hasta las instalaciones (spa, club lounge, ...)! agradecer de verdad, la manera en que se dirige este hotel.

Un'altra nota positiva è il ristorante dell'hotel dove oltre al menù alla carta, con € 25 a persona viene proposto un menù fisso con tre portate a scelta, acqua e vino compresi, tutto di alta qualità. C'è anche un coffee shop dove è possibile fare spuntini veloci. Giudizio complessivo buono.",4,2015,04,07
12,Perfetto,"Posizione strategica per muoversi in tutta comodità, per me è situato in una delle zone più belle di tutta Barcellona (praticamente sulla stessa strada della fontana magica)!
Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo! Zona molto tranquilla, da ritornarci e consigliare!",5,2015,04,06
12,Muy buen hotel .......lástima de bufet,"Hemos pasado 3 noches mi mujer y yo en este maravilloso hotel , empecemos por la habitación , preciosa con una cama enorme , muy amplia con un baño limpio y espacioso, perfecta ..... El servicio perfecto tanto en recepción como en el restaurante , ( llegamos a las 10,45 de la noche y nos dieron de cenar muy bien y con una sonrisa, cierran a las 11 la cocina )
 restaurante es muy bonito con una buena carta y muy buenos precios ,
El ""PERO"" de este hotel es el bufet del desayuno , la verdad es que es bastante flojo , el café bastante malo , el embutido regular.... La tortilla es de huevina los dulces son industriales y los zumos no son naturales , y es una pena por que el hotel sería perfecto por todo lo que he comentado antes y por dónde esta situado , de todas maneras volveremos seguro ",4,2015,03,31
12,Muy buena opción ,"Elegimos este hotel porque nos gusta tener 2 camas en la habitación y este es de los pocos que las tienen en Barcelona. Muy buen servicio tanto en la recepción como en la habitación. Limpio, cómodo, amplio y con todo el confort de un buen Hotel. Esta zona no nos es muy conocida y por ese motivo no le di la máxima puntuación. Salíamos y tomábamos un taxi... Igualmente, volvería ",4,2015,03,27
12,Muy Aconsejable,"Habitaciones renovadas recientemente , muy amplias TV 42 pulgadas conexionada con internet Google lo tienes todo , baño corectisimo , desayuno perfecto , excelente trato del personal

Sólo un pero,  los salones necesitan una renovación urgentisima

Hotel ideal para ferias y congresos ",4,2015,03,22
12,Ottima soluzione per qualsiasi occasione,"Sono stata per motivi di lavoro a Barcellona al Crowne Plaza e devo dire che è un albergo dotato di ogni confort. Camere eccellenti, ampie, pulitissime e nuove. Eccellente colazione. È' presente una piccola, ma ben attrezzata palestra e piscina con spa. Il personale è molto disponibile e professionale. Unico neo, nella sala riunioni grande lo schermo non era visibile per intero dalla 4rta fila in poi, ma problema facilmente risolvibile",4,2015,03,14
12,Meraviglioso,"Meraviglioso in tutto, dalla posizione al personale dalle stanze alla pulizia. Una nota doverosa alla cucina, molto buona. Il personale molto preparato sempre a disposizione per soddisfare le nostre esigenze. Complimeti",5,2015,03,10
12,Más de lo que te esperas!!!,"Estuvimos alojados para ver el Congreso mundial del movil que se celebraba en Barcelona y solo podemos decir que son llevamos una grata sorpresa! Escogimos este hotel por ser de 4 estrellas y porque tenía unos aprecios asequibles para esas fechas. Sin embargo, todo lo que nos encontramos fue totalmente positivo. Una recepción muy bien cuidada y que olía muy bien, la habitación super ancha con una cama king y una televisión enorme. El baño simplemente un 10 sobre 10. El hotel tiene un Spa que no llegamos a utilizar. El personal muy atento y amable, sobre todo en el club donde nos gusto mucho como Lisa nos atendió, y como Mario nos servía el champagne, todo muy profesional. Destacar también el servicio de ordenadores que tienen al lado de recepción que están a tu disposición, las 24 h del día. En cuanto a la ubicación, perfecta, a solo 10 min en metro del centro y a unos pasos de Pl España.
Recomendado al 100%",5,2015,03,07
12,Genial como siempre ,"Apuesta segura, bien situado, magníficamente equipado, un servicio fantástico y un ambiente agradable.

12,Fabulosa escapada romántica,"Buenos días,
Me he alojado en este hotel este último fin de semana (13/02/2015 al 15/02/2015). Se trataba de una sorpresa que le he hecho a mi marido con motivo de su cumpleaños y nuestro aniversario de bodas. La atención y el seguimiento de Rafa (de la central de reservas) se merecen más de un diez.
 Ha sido fantástico. Cava con fresas bañadas en chocolate a nuestra llegada, desayuno continental en la habitación, masaje dúo y Spa, cena romántica en el restaurante.
El personal atento y profesional, las instalaciones inmejorables, la comida perfecta, las habitaciones espaciosas, cama súper grande y cómoda, TV impresionante, albornoz, cafetera, wiffi... un sin fin de detalles para hacer la estancia más que agradable. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados.",5,2015,02,17
12,Ottima soluzione,"Hotel che Vale più delle 4 stelle. Le camere sono veramente ampie, nuove e pulite. Nella mia c'era un tavolo x 6, divano e poltrona relax. Doppio televisore lcd da 46 pollici. Sala da bagno molto grande e ben divisa.  Ottima la colazione, ampia e varia. Non ricordo una pecca, sala pc con 6 Mac e 2 pc, + stampante, sempre aperta. WiFi gratis in tutto l'hotel.  Anche la posizione è buona, in zona fiera, a poche centinaia di metri da plaza de Espania, vi sono due Fermate di Metro a pochi metri e taxi fuori. Se volete un ottimo Hotel non esitate ad andarci.",5,2015,02,13
12,Schleppender Service,"Für Besichtigungen praktisch gelegenes Hotel. Schönes Zimmer und sehr gutes Bad. Leider im Service enttäuschend; einmal gab es gar keinen Roommservicxe; der Kaffee wurde beim Frühstück nur mit Verzögerung nachgeschenkt, die Rezeption war beim Check-In nur mit einer sehr langsamen Person besetzt. Für das Gebotene zu teuer.",3,2015,02,12
12,Hotel Mejorado,"Hotel que ha mejorado en los ultimos tiempos la verdad que necesitaba una reforma y asi lo han hecho. Mi mas sincera enhorabuena. Habitaciones calidad -precio buena. Aunque les pondre un ""pero"" falta mejorar la calidad de su Restaurante el Mall sobre todo de su comida aunque los precios no son exageradamente elevados y su Restaurante de Desayunos falta mas variedad productos y sobre todo productos de Regimen alimenticio que son casi inexistentes.
Lo demas todo recomendable.",4,2015,02,08
12,Fantastico!! Da non perdere assolutamente,"Sono rimasto estasiato da quest'albergo in quanto già ci ero stato per un altro congresso 2 anni fa (e non mi aveva assolutamente colpito), ma ora è stato radicalmente trasformato. E' stata fatta una ristrutturazione ed un ammodernamento che ha interessato stanze, hall, spa, ambienti comuni e che ha reso l'hotel bellissimo ed assolutamente funzionale. La posizione in cui è ubicato permette di arrivare dovunque a Barcellona in pochissimo tempo utilizzando metro o taxi. La cucina è assolutamente buonissima (da italiano sono un rompiscatole e non mi accontento mai, soprattutto all'estero) ed il personale è sempre estremamente professionale e gentilissimo. Voglio segnalare, oltretutto i ragazzi della reception ed in particolare Fernando, un professionista esemplare dai modi eleganti, capace di risolvere ogni problema e di dare sempre ottimi consigli su dove cenare e cosa fare a Barcellona. Sicuramente ci tornerò appena sarò a Barcellona.",5,2015,01,19

12,Hotel fantastico!!,"Sono appena rientrata da Barcellona e voglio condividere con Voi il mio meraviglioso soggiorno in questo fantastico hotel.
In posizione strategica a circa 200 metri da Piazza Espania e a 50 metri dalla fontana magica ai piedi di Montjjuic e il luogo ideale per trascorrere un meraviglioso soggiorno a Barcellona.
L 'hotel 4 stelle superior merita appieno la sua categoria.
Pulitissimo, le camere molto grandi e ben arredate e lo staff cordialissimo.
Ultima nota positiva il ristorante dell'hotel dove con € 25 a persona propongono un menù fisso con portate a scelta, acqua e vino compresi - tutto molto buono !!",5,2014,12,09
12,Eccellente,"Hotel eccellente in tutti gli aspetti e lo si capisce appena si entra: la hall è enorme e molto elegante e tutti i receptionist sono bravissimi e gentili, oltre che molto simpatici. Un grazie particolare a Fernando che ha pure fatto preparare una torta di compleanno per nostro figlio: una sorpresa molto gradita! Le camere sono spaziose e pulite e dotate di letti molto grandi e comodi. Il bagno è altrettanto grande, con una doccia enorme. La TV è a schermo piatto (50 o 52"") dal quale si accede a Youtube. La colazione è molto abbondante, con un buffet  fornitissimo sia di dolce che di salato. Molto buoni i dolci e niente male il cappuccino. Costa 18€ a persona ma vale la pena. Il ristorante El Mall è buonissimo: abbiamo gradito in particolare la carne e le verdure, le paelle sono ottime e anche molto economiche (sui 16/18€ in 2!). Il servizio è di ottimo livello. All'interno si trovano anche una SPA appena aperta, un bar, il Business Center con una decina di PC a disposizione gratuita. Inoltre l'hotel è stato ristrutturato da poco e si trova vicinissimo a Espanya e al Montjuic: la Fontana Magica si raggiunge a piedi in neanche 5 minuti. Molto comodo raggiungerlo dall'aeroporto con Aerobus che ferma a Espanya.",5,2014,12,04
12,Habitaciones enormes y camas comodisimas,"Hotel lujoso en zona muy agradable, no faltaba detalle. Hay una zona de acceso a Internet de alta velocidad muy tranquila donde puedes trabajar a gusto con ordenadores macintosh de ultima generación. Repetiría sin falta. ",5,2014,11,25
12,se dovete andare in fiera Montjuic ma anche no,"Hotel gradevole, camere enormi e moderne, letti splendidi, bagno grande e di ottima qualità  ideale per piu' giorni
unico difetto la connessione WIFI (kubi) gratis ma non funziona quasi mail o vi fà impazzire.....",5,2014,11,24
12,NO GO,"Auch hier ein deutliches minus für den Gesamteindruck für ein Business Hotel. Check in sehr schlecht an Reception, welche leer war. Da Clubfloor gebucht hat man mich weggeschickt auf eine andere Etage (Clubfloor). Check in von Lisa sehr freundlich, mitdenkend und hilfsbereit!!! Gebuchte Zimmerkategorie nicht verfügbar und ausgebucht. Jemand der durch lautes wirbeln die ganze Club Lounge in Unruhe brachte war der Direktor persönlich. Er kümmerte sich nur um seine persönliche Gäste mit Champagner und Co. aber grüßte Vollzahler nicht. Durch eine Messe waren eingeladene Hotelgäste da, welche keinen Euro zahlten. Die Lounge war entsprechend voll und man schlug sich förmlich und den Champagner. Als Vollzahler war das ein Witz anzusehen. Frühstücksraum in der Lounge mega voll durch Nichtzahler. Nachlegen der Speisen sehr schleppend. Angebot schlecht. Auf Nachfrage beim Hotelpersonal wo die Butter ist (Englisch) verstand man nur Toilette. Zimmermädchen betrat Zimmer ohne anklopfen. Abendessen im Restaurant Katastrophe. Dreckige Teller, unliebes anrichteten der Speisen, ungelernte Kellner. Zimmer sauber jedoch Duschabfluss war verstopft, Schiebetüre am Schrank kaputt und ließ sich schwer öffnen und der Safe war nicht angeschraubt und Schrauben nur zum Schein eingesteckt. Check out ohne Nachfrage wie es war nichts besonderes. Für knapp 300 Euro und als nicht willkommener Gast nie wieder! ",1,2014,11,19

12,Excelente Hotel en el centro de Barcelona,"Estuvimos en este hotel durante casi una semana y he de decir que aparte de grande limpio y muy comodo tiene un servicio fantastico y sus empleados son de lo mejor.

Es el tercer año consecutivo que vamos allí por temas de trabajo para una feria en la Fira y siempre ha salido todo genial. Nuestros invitados japoneses acaban siempre contentisimos y no solo con el hotel, tambien con el restaurante que es exquisito.

Totalmente recomendado",5,2014,11,05
12,"Comodo, lujoso y muy bien ubicado","Viaje en Septiembre con mi familia a Europa y estuvimos primero en Barcelona. El Hotel se encuentra en la zona de Montjuic a pocos minutos del estadio del Barca y de las fuentes con luces (excelente show). Toma 10 minutos en taxi llegar a la barceloneta y al puerto que son las zonas mas turísticas. Las habitaciones son amplias y muy cómodas. El desayuno excelente y muy variado. cuentan con un Bar que abre hasta tarde y un excelente Restaurante. El check in tomo un poco de tiempo (15-20 minutos) luego acelero pues eramos 3 habitaciones. La atención muy buena 

Recomiendo totalmente este hotel para quienes visiten Barcelona",5,2014,10,21
12,Magnífica experiencia,"Desde la recepción, amable en especial en la noche pero siempre profesional, hasta la cafetería, el restaurante, el desayuno...
Todo bien cuidado. Las habitaciones enormes y con espacios amplios tanto en el propio dormitorio como en el aseo, con tres zonas separadas, el armario, la zona de trabajo... 
También muy cuidada la iluminación, con automatismos donde debe haber y control total desde la cabecera de la cama para todo el resto. Climatización silenciosa, wifi como abierto y una moto en todo el hotel, complementos de baño no solo abundantes sino de buena calidad... y un televisor led de unas dimensión que no imaginarías.
Nada es perfecto... y puedo poner algún pero...: el garaje pide andarse con cuidado al entrar y no habían anotado en su sistema que mi estancia estaba previamente abonada. Pero el primer tema no tiene mucho remedio y el segundo lo remediaron con una verificación y una disculpa cortés en menos de medio minuto.
Si su ubicación te encaja... muy recomendable.",5,2014,10,18
12,Magnífico hotel,"Hotel muy confortable. La habitación doble enorme y con todo (y más) de lo necesario. El desayuno buffet de buen nivel aunque mejorable en cuanto a variedad. El único ""pero"", es la insonorización interna, que no es todo lo buena que cabría esperar ya que se oyen los ruidos de las habitaciones y pasillo. Con todo, es un hotel altamente recomendable. El servicio fue amable y profesional. Sin problemas",5,2014,10,13
12,La mejor relacion calidad precio.,"En la Ciudad de Barcelona, si hay un hotel que reune las mejores condiciones para un alojamiento, es el Crowne Plaza. 
La recepcion es inmejorable. Muy atentos y cordiales.
Lo espacioso de sus habitaciones, con excelente decoracion, mantenido a nuevo permamentemente, silencioso, y por si esto fuese poco, multiples atenciones sin cargo , cafe te, chocolates, agua etc.
El desayuno digno de un 6 estrellas, lo que quieras, gran variedad y cantidad, y  podes cerrar con cava.
Volveria con todo gusto.",5,2014,10,08
12,Excelente,"Desde la atención, el desayuno, la cama increíble, el baño completísimo, todo de lo mejor. Lástima que no estaba habilitado el gimnasio ni la piscina. La zona es hermosa, a metros de la fuente mágica y el Montüic. Para recomendar y regresar.",5,2014,10,07
12,Ottimo,"Bellissimo hotel non lontano dal centro e a pochi passi dalla famosa ""magic fountain"" 
Camere stupende, pulitissime, personale molto cortese e preparato. Nonostante fossi lì per lavoro e' stata un'esperienza molto bella. 
La rambla con un po' di voglia di camminare può essere raggiunta a piedi. Quartiere tranquillo. Colazione eccellente con un'ampia varietà di scelte sia per il dolce che per il salato. 
Complimenti",5,2014,09,26
12,El mejor hotel cerca del Palau Sant Jordi.,"Funcional, tranquilo,desayuno más que aceptable,habitaciones amplias y comodísimas.El mejor hotel para disfrutar del mundial de Basquet 2014.Wifi gratuito.Muy cerca de la Plaza de España,pero en zona tranquila.La única pega es que la piscina,el SPA y el gimnasio estan en obras.",5,2014,09,07
12,Rilassante,"Ottimo albergo, camere spaziose e pulite. Personalmente lo penalizzo per distanza dalla metropolitana e per il rapporto qualità / prezzo in quanto in altri alberghi della stessa catena a tariffe comparabili vi è la piscina. Colazione molto variegata e abbondante, personale disponibile. Se riuscirò a trovare una tariffa più bassa (magari prenotando in anticipo) tornerò presso questa struttura.",4,2014,09,01
12,"Eccellente posizione, accoglienza favolosa,sistemazione alberghiera ottimale","L' Hotel è situato in una posizione ottimale : è a 2 minuti (a piedi !) dalla fontana magica , a 5 minuti dalla Piazza de Espanya e dalla metropolitana, a 2 fermate dalla Rampla di Catalunya.
Le camere sono stupende e funzionali. Il Lounge Club merita una menzione speciale, con tapas eccellenti (le migliori di Barcellona, ella mia esperienza!), vini e Champagne di marca a disposizione dalle 10 alle 23 in alternativa agli altri (eccellenti!) servizi dell' Hotel. La gentilezza e disponibilità del personale è inusuale, e merita una ulteriore menzione speciale. La doccia, come già segnalato, è un ""must"" utile dopo una calda giornata di agosto in giro per la città o dopo una giornata ""attiva"" congressuale . Barcellona, con il suo fascino peculiare, fa il resto , ma il Crowne aiute tutti a godersela meglio.",5,2014,09,01
12,Struttura molto bella e pulita. Posizione non comodissima,"Ho soggiornato in questo Hotel per 4 notti prima di Ferragosto con la mia ragazza.
La struttura è curata e molto pulita; le camere sono ampie e con servizi adeguati. 
Unico neo la posizione: si trova a 10 minuti dalla fermata metro in Plaza de Espanya ma la strada da percorrere è totalmente mancante di negozi o bar/ristoranti quindi la camminata non risulta molto piacevole. In parziale compenso si trova alla fine della strada dove poter ammirare il famoso spettacolo delle fontane. Menzione speciale per i receptionist notturni (in particolare Sergi) molto disponibili nel dare indicazioni e info utili, al contrario di quelli presenti durante la mattina in grado dire solamente ""questa è la mappa, noi siamo qui"". In un albergo del genere, parte di una catena così famosa, penso sia lecito aspettarsi non solo il mero pernottamento ma anche un certo servizio di accoglienza. Non credo ci tornerei soprattutto per la posizione, dato il tempo necessario per raggiungere i veri punti di interesse della città.",4,2014,09,01
12,Ottimo Hotel e personale cortese,"L'Hotel si trova nella zona fiera Montjuic alla destra della fontana Magica, la fermata della metropolitana più vicina è Espanya  (linea rossa e linea verde). La zona è tranquilla. L'Hotel è confortevole e pulito, le camere molto ampie e dotate di tutti i confort con un rapporto qulità/prezzo giusto. Non abbiamo preso la formula con prima colazione perchè troppo costosa, ma adiacente all'Hotel c'è una panetteria che fa dei cornetti buonissimi e c'è anche un bar per il caffè. Il personale è super cortese.",4,2014,08,28
12,Confortevole con doccia magnifica,"Struttura confortevole e di qualità. I bagni puliti e ben fatti. La doccia è qualcosa di magnific, larga e rubinetteria di altussimo livello dalla regolazione superlativa. Il terzo giorno abbiamo avuto problemi con dell acqua che cadeva dal piano di sopra credo per rottura di tubi. Dopo un pochino di titubanza da parte dell addetto alla reception (un po' antipatico per la verità) è arrivato il direttore ( gentilissimo) e ci ha offerto la colazione a tutta la famiglia e ci ha spostato in una meravigliosa suite. Posizione comoda a 500 metri dalla metro di piazza espanya e vicink alla fontana di montjiuc, dove in alcune sere c'è un bello spettacolo dell acqua.",5,2014,08,25
12,Hotel di classe sulla via della fontana magica.,"Camere ampie e con tutti i comforts, acqua, biscotti e cioccolatini gratis ogni giorno. Bagno bellissimo e letti super comodi e grandi. Personale gentilissimo anche i camerieri a cena simpatici e disponibili (la cena buffet molto ricca costa 25 euro a persona comprese bevande). La fonte magica con lo spettacolo notturno, è sulla stassa strada e l'avinguda della Reina Maria Cristina, di fronte la fontana, è bellissima da percorrere ogni giorno in 5 minuti per andare alla metro o ai bus. Per andare e tornare dall'aereoporto è comodo ed economico (biglietto standard dei bus o T 10) il bus n° 46 in placa Espana.",5,2014,08,25
12,Un más que adecuado hotel,"Esablecimiento correcto, con una atención perfecta, habitación muy amplia, luminosa y muy limpia. Es cierto que no tienen gimnasio, pero te ofrecen un vale para ir a uno que esta muy cerca, no lo utilizamos por lo que no se como será, pero si nos lo indicaron en recepción. Está situado en un sitio tranquilo y muy cerca del metro. Un hotel para tener en cuenta la próxima visita.",4,2014,08,25
12,"Bello, ma non fare colazione qui!","Camere veramente ampie e comode. Oltre al letto matrimoniale avevamo un divano e una poltrona molto comodi. Bagno bello e grande, come pochi se ne trovano in altri hotel. Carino il rinfresco di benvenuto e l'idea dell'aromaterapia. Docciaschiuma, shampoo e balsamo nuovi ogni giorno. Pulizia delle camere incredibile. Comodissima anche la cassaforte nell'armadio e la possibilità di lasciare custoditi i bagagli prima del check-in e dopo il check-out. Le camere sono luminose, piene di luci e con uno schermo Tv grande. L'albergo in sé è molto carino e con molti servizi per i clienti. Due le note negative: la pulizia della moquette nei luoghi comuni e il costo spropositato della colazione: ben 18€ a testa (è sì abbondante ma abbiamo trovato locali in cui servivano praticamente le stesse identiche cose a metà prezzo). Da notare anche che il costo riportato era 14 e quindi abbiamo avuto una bella sorpresina! La zona è ottima, tranquilla ma vicina alla fermata della metro! ",4,2014,08,23
12,"Ottimo, veramente.","Abbiamo soggiornato per tre notti in questo hotel e ne siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti. Dopo un piccolo problema iniziale (camera doppia invece che familiare) prontamente risolto con l'intervento della direzione, tutto é andato benissimo. Camere gigantesche, colazione molto buona e talmente abbondante da saltare il pranzo. Il parcheggio dell'hotel é comodo ed economico. La metro si trova a cinque minuti di distanza ma sotto l'hotel ci sono sempre dei taxi che con 10€ (un biglietto della metro viene 2,10€, quindi una famiglia spende uguale...) ti portano ovunque. Il personale inoltre é molto cortese. L'hotel é vicinissimo alla zona Fiera (per gli architetti, al padiglione di Mies) quindi in posizione decentrata rispetto alla cittá ma non se ne risente.",5,2014,08,21

Colazione internazionale abbondante.

12,4 estrellas no merecidas,"Primeramente dicen que tienen gimnasio y spa y no lo tendrán en funcionamiento hasta septiembre. Todo esto sin avisar previamente. Estuve 45 minutos para hacer checkin. Habia un congreso y no tenian previsto el horario de llegada de los congresistas con lo cual, tenian colapsada la recepción. Una tarde solicité en recepción cambio de 50 € y sin comprobar me digeron que no tenian y que saliera a cambiar yo. El último dia, a las 4 de la tarde pergunté en la cafetería donde estaba la terraza de la que hacian gala en su web. El camarero de la cafetería de muy malas maneras me dijo que la terraza no se podia utilizar porque tenian todo preparado para una cena ese mismo dia. Me acerque, no obstante y efectivamente habia 4 mesas grandes con los servicios de comida y 4 veladores disponibles pero sin servicio de cafetería.",2,2014,06,28
12,Una de las mejores opciones en Barcelona,"Nada que envidiar al resto de hoteles de Barcelona sin ninguna duda. El personal es atento y amabilísimo desde el minuto 1, cuidan en todo el hotel hasta el detalle más insignificante para hacerlo impactante a la vista, salones enormes y espaciosos para todo tipo de eventos y atenciones contigo hasta el final. 

Muy cerca de dos paradas de metro y de la Estación de Sants, y a sólo 400 metros de la fuente mágica, así que perfectamente conectado desde ellas a toda Barcelona. Da la sensación de que es apostar sobre seguro.",5,2014,06,27

Está pensado para ejecutivos,  pero ni por asomo lo volvimos a contratar para nuestras estancias en Barcelona. Nuestra empresa desde luego no. Fuimos 4 días por motivos de trabajo, la atención recibida desde el principio fue hiperantipática. Uno de los días escuchamos unos gritos al dirigirnos a la sala de desayunos, y cual fue nuestro espanto al comprobar que era la recepcionista desde su mostrador, que nos llamaba la atención a gritos a nosotros para que no entráramos pues ya habían cerrado el servicio. No critico que no nos dejaran entrar, era el momento justo de cierre, sino esos gritos que daba  la recepcionista, inmóvil,  desde su mostrador, con clientes esperando a ser atendidos.. lamentable. Por lo demás el diseño típico de hotel moderno pero sin más, se queda en eso.",2,2014,06,03

Insomma tutti i comfort, tariffa buona x viaggi di lavoro.",5,2014,05,18
12,Muy buen hotel,"Desde la llegada, la recepción , el trato exquisito. Rápida atención , afable, eficiente.
Buena habitación ( quinta planta ) - habitación doble de luxe ideal para el descanso por la ausencia de ruidos , buenas camas, Tv maxi, baño impecable.
Desayuno adecuado pero con falta de productos calientes.
En conjunto un hotel para recomendar.",5,2014,05,12
12,ottimo hotel non centralissimo,"hotel rinnovato, reception grande ed accogliente.
La mia stanza era grande, comoda, modernissima con un TV da almeno 70'.
Bagno grande con doccia e vasca.
Colazione buona, ma l' offerta non mi è sembrata stratosferica.
Per arrivare al porto ci sono circa 2,5 km, al centro qualcosa di meno.
Rapporto qualità prezzo molto buono.
Unica pecca, ma di poco conto, i vetri della finestra erano veramente tanto sporchi....ma è una sottigliezza.",5,2014,05,09
12,Non è tutto oro quello che luccica!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato 4 notti in questo hotel decidendo di spendere di più rispetto agli standard di Barcellona e rimanendo leggermente defilati rispetto al centro pur di non avere sorprese. Ma le sorprese ci sono state eccome!
Prendiamo 2 stanze Deluxe (più care rispetto alle standard) e le chiediamo comunicanti (avevamo una figlia minorenne con noi). Ci confermano via email le stanze comunicanti. Arriviamo in albergo ed il personale alla reception non era preparato alla richiesta delle stanze comunicanti. Dopo circa mezzora di di imbarazzo ci danno le chiavi saliamo e SORPRESA! la matrimoniale aveva il bagno senza bidet ed era solo con doccia ma per DISADABILI. Avete mai visto una doccia siffatta? E' aperta e sia per fare il bidet che per fare la vera e propria doccia trasformava il bagno in un pantano. La presa di corrente non aveva la SHUCO per il phone che aveva una spina SHUCO! La vista era CORTILE INTERNO squallido e con condizionatori. A chi danno le stanze con vista esterna? Tutte e2 le stanze avevano la medesima brutta vista. Vacanza in salita. La metro non era distante ma nemmeno vicinissima. Vacanza tutta in salita insomma.....",2,2014,05,06
12,Lusso a buon prezzo,"È indubbiamente un hotel lussuoso e confortevolissimo. Ma si può trovare a prezzi accessibili, a volte. Quindi, perché non profittarne ? La stanza è grandissima. Ha tutti i servizi immaginabili ed una ottima posizione, vicino alla Avinguida ed alla metropolitana, al Montjuic e, tutto sommato, anche alla ramblas, raggiungibili anche con una buona camminata.",5,2014,05,03
12,Ottimo per lavoro,"Viaggio di lavoro e soggiorno al Fira Palace. Hotel un po' decentrato ma comunque vicino alla metropolitana, Ottima accoglienza, camere ampie, confortevoli, con arredamento moderno e funzionale. Bagno spazioso. Colazione strepitosa, purtroppo wifi a pagamento. Da consigliare. ",4,2014,04,30
12,Exelente,"Muy buen hotel en todos los sentidos: situación, habitaciones, limpieza servicios,...Nos sorprendió encontrarlo a ese precio. A reseñar la super pantalla de TV y la amplitud de la habitación.

Para repetir sin ninguna duda

12,Da un 4 stelle mi aspetto di più,Ci sono stato per lavoro. Camere poco illuminate e con la solita desueta moquette. Il letto però molto comodo ed il breakfast buono e completo.  Personale molto gentile. La posizione è abbastanza centrale e con circa mezzora di camminata si raggiunge la rambla.,3,2014,04,24
12,Recomiendo 100%,"Estuvimos 7 personas en familia del 16 de Abril al 20 de Abril Hotel de 5 estrellas aunque ponga 4 estrellas Fabulosa ubicación y trato excelente, habitación espectacular, no pudimos ver las piscinas que estaban en obra

12,viaggio di lavoro,"ho trascorso due notti all'Hotel Crowne Plaza Bacelona per motivi di lavoro.
Avevo una camera nell'ala A al primo piano : la camera era molto ampia , luminosa ,pulita ; il bagno grande con doccia e vasca da bagno.
La colazione era soddisfacente e abbastanza ricca sia di cibi dolci sia di salati , servizio attento.
L'albergo è vicino alla Fontana magica che ad orari prestabiliti ( sicuramente alle venti ) si attiva con luci colorate e zampilli a suon di musica : da non perdere.
L'albergo non è in centro per cui occorre muoversi o con la metro o con taxi ma la zona è tranquilla , senza problemi.",4,2014,04,19
12,Hotel impecable en todos los sentidos,"Gran experiencia la vivida en este gran hotel de Barcelona.  Me ha impresionado la espaciosa habitación donde destaca una Smart TV de 55"" y una gran cama súper cómoda en la que descansado genial. Se nota que se cuida hasta el más pequeño detalle: incluso el olor en todo el hotel es espectacular.
El desayuno también me ha encantado con una gran variedad de platos tanto fríos como calientes y con especial atención a la comida saludable, muy importante para los viajeros deportistas como yo.
Su ubicación al lado de la Plaza de España me ha parecido estupenda y está muy bien comunicado, incluso con el autobús que te trae desde el aeropuerto (Aerobus) que te deja a tres minutos.
Si vuelvo a Barcelona repetiré hotel sin dudarlo.",5,2014,04,15
12,veramente di qualità..!!,"ho dormito già alcune volte in questo albergo e sempre mi sono trovato in maniera fantastica. ottima organizzazione e disponibilità da parte di tutti poi le camere sono incredibilmente spaziose e estremamente funzionali. complimenti alla direzione dell'hotel, ottima organizzazione.

12,Perfetto,"Ottimo hotel 4 stelle superior, stanze grandi (in stile americano) con letto king size, divano e tv gigante. Bagno enorme e moderno unica pecca ogni tanto si sentiva un odore sgradevole.
Il personale si è sempre mostrato gentile. Pulizia in tutto l'hotel molto buona. Si trova in un buon quartiere, zona ""plaza Espana"" e vicino c'è tutto quello di cui si può aver bisogno. Certo, non è economico ma il lusso e certi servizi si pagano.",5,2014,04,07
12,Excelente y cómodo,"Hotel excelente en el centro de Barcelona, en general muy recomendable para venir a trabajar en el centro de Barcelona y, el perfecto sí vienes a la Fira. Habitaciones amplias, con espacio para trabajar, salones funcionales, buen desayuno, buen servicio de catering y servicio profesional. Repetiría ",5,2014,04,05
12,"hotel moderno, limpio y bien situado.","Encuentro este hotel perfecto si tienes que estar cerca del Palau Sant Jordi, del Palacio de Congresos o de Feria Barcelona. Para ir a cualquiera de estos lugares os aseguro que es perfecto. Hotel limpio, moderno y con excelente atención. A pocos metros de la Fuente Mágica de Montjuic. No obstante, nosotros quisimos ir al centro de Barcelona (Las Ramblas y Plaza Cataluña) y con metro o bus no se tarda nada en llegar...aunque nosotros quisimos ir a pie y les aseguro que es un paseo agradable de unos 30 minutos si vas por la zona del puerto hasta llegar al monumento a Colón. El descanso está asegurado...no he estado en ningún hotel una cama más cómoda que esta y se respeta el silencio en todo el hotel.",5,2014,03,26
12,finalmente un vero 4 stelle,"Sono appena tornato  per lavoro da barcellona dove ho soggornato in questo Hotel, assegnatomi dall'organizzazione di un congresso medico.....Devo dire che non e' facile trovare hotel di 4 stelle superior veri...Camera spaziosa bagno grande tutti i servizi disponibili.. televisore a parete spaziale grandissimo, letti grandi e comodi. Pulito in ottima posizione.Colazione abbondante e di qualita'... Personale gentile e veloce... che dire altro.....",5,2014,03,22
12,camere splendide,"un 4 stelle superior, ma con nulla da invidiare ad un 5 stelle!! le camere sono spettacolari, belle, pulite, spaziose….il personale è molto gentile, la hall molto grande e confortevole!! collocato in una zona comoda, e comunque con quello che costano i taxi in un ottima posizione",5,2014,03,12
12,Excelente hotel bien ubicado,"Hotel excelente para los que acudan a cualquier evento que se celebre en el recinto ferial de Barcelona, por cercanía y por calidad de los servicios. También para quien quiera estar en una zona céntrica de Barcelona, cerca de casi cualquier cosa que haya de ver. Las habitaciones  recién renovadas, muy cómodas y amplias (al menos las de la última planta). Sillon de trabajo cómodo, mesa para trabjar si hace falta, un buen sofá para descansar sin tener que echarse en la cama, y la cama, insuperable para descansar tras un día de ajetreado trabajo. El baño muy bien organizado, con water separado del resto del baño, bañera y pié de ducha separados también, para facilitar el uso. Una elección muy interesante.",4,2014,03,03
12,"Acogedor, moderno y agradable.","Hemos pasado el puente de Andalucía en Barcelona y optamos por este hotel debido a los comentarios tan favorables que tenía. Recientemente lo ha adquirido la cadena Crowne Plaza. Éramos 2 adultos y dos niños (5 y7 años), la habitación muy amplia, moderna y bien equipada. Destacar una gran smart TV de 55 pulgadas y un gran cuarto de baño. Las camas muy confortables y el desayuno buffet muy completo. Es recomendable, si vas en coche, dejarlo en el parking del hotel (15 €/día ), en sus alrededores es muy difícil aparcar y sólo existen zonas azules o verdes de estacionamiento. Su ubicación también es buena, cerca de Montjuic y junto a la feria de Barcelona, en unos 5 minutos andando tienes el metro de Plaza Espanya y un gran centro comercial.",5,2014,03,02
