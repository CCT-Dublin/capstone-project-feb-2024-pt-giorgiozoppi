249,"Large hotel ideal for B&B just off the M50 motorway - clean, comfortable, quiet","This is a large modern hotel on the outskirts of Dublin, just off the M50 motorway.  It was perfect as a place for B&B whilst at a conference.  Clean, comfortable, quiet, large breakfast buffet with all the usuals, great staff, safe and well-lit underground parking (at 10 Euro/night), good restaurant food, well-appointed bedrooms.  Being so large and modern it felt a bit soulless but the staff and service were great and made up for that.",5,2024,10,04
249,Close to Shopping Centre,"It’s a nice hotel, clean, comfortable beds, a good variety of breakfast foods, Tina on reception was particularly friendly & helpful, and close to Shopping Centre. We didn’t sleep much after 6.30am as we could hear people talking, and heard the showers running in other rooms nearby, heard doors closing & furniture being moved around - they need to put pads on the chair legs to dull the noise. We had been at Mamma Mia show in 3Arena, and Port Tunnel was closed so we had to drive the long way back and didn’t arrive at hotel until 11:50pm.  There was a sign saying lift wasn’t in operation after 11pm and to use the stairs, which we thought were inside, but they were external stairs at the side of hotel. It had been raining, so we had to be careful on the steps - there was a handrail - but I was glad that I wasn’t on my own from a security point of view. We were looking forward to having a drink or two in the hotel bar, but it was closed!  Apparently it closes at 11.30pm on week days. Unbelievable!  The porter at the door looked more like a security guard & there were two burly gentlemen behind reception desk so that made me feel a bit nervous. Were they expecting trouble??  I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and loved it, but I don’t think it’s as good now as it was years ago but, having said all that, I  would stay here again but just not on my own.",3,2024,09,29
249,Great place to stay,From check in to check out great experience the staff are simply lovely could not do enough for us rooms so spacious spotless and the food in restaurant is simply devine pavel roam and arthur where so attentive and treated us like royalty dinner was fab and brekkie delicious would highly recommend look forward to booking again,5,2024,09,21
249,Basic hotel,"To begin with the hotel is very easy to access just off the motorway.  There was plenty of parking.  Receptionist was lovely and gave plenty of details about everything in the hotel and surrounding areas.  The hotel itself is very dated.  
Nothing luxurious about bedroom or ensuite.  Window was broken so we had to wedge it closed with a towel.  You could see screws on wall where a full length mirror should be hanging and this is beside the hairdryer so very awkward to dry hair.  
Alot of noise in hallway.  
Breakfast wasn't great.  Waited ages for glasses for juice and then when they arrived they were hot.  
No jam or Nutella.  Asked for poached eggs and the minute they arrived we could smell the vinegar so they were untouched.  
No issue with staff as all seemed very obliging.",3,2024,09,18
249,"Noisy, illegal smoking in rooms","Stayed in Clayton for work. The room had a interconnecting door . All I could hear was blaring TV, people talking, slamming cabinet doors, slamming room doors. Then the smell of weed coming under my door. I contacted management twice and was told they would send security up to tell them keep noise down. I said what about smoking weed in room when no smoking permitted this was dismissed. Night manager demonstrated poor management skills in deal with the situation. I got the vibe that he had no interest in dealing with the issue.standards of this hotel have gone right down",1,2024,09,14
249,Great stay,"I had stayed at this hotel previously a few times a couple of years ago but was really apprehensive after reading some of the reviews. Our stay however was lovely. 
We used this as a base to go to zoo and use leisure centre and have some casual dining.
We are in the bar in the evening and the food was absolutely delicious. Our waiter (sorry I never got his name) was so attentive and pleasant. He could not do enough for us. 
The room we had was spacious and very clean. 
Breakfast was buffet style so nothing amazing but very functional and lots of choice. It does get busy, but that was to be expected during peak time.
We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel, everything was really good and it was great value.",4,2024,09,07
249,Birthday dinner and stay,"We stayed as a group for a birthday. Young kids to adults. We were looked after for dinner by Sakshi in the globe bar and restaurant and she couldn't have done more. Very attentive and quick service all evening. Thank you so much, we will be back.",5,2024,08,28
249,Nice hotel for business travel,"Stayed here when travelling on business. The whole hotel has a modern feel. The restaurant and bar is separate which is good as you’re not eating/drinking in amongst each other.

The rooms were spacious, good quality, well equipped with facilities. These had shampoo/shower gel, soap, a mini bar, TV, plenty of towels. There wasn’t a bottle opener in the room which this could have done with.

The bed was comfy and I got a good nights sleep.

The hotels location was central and only a short walk away from the Shopping Center as well as a retail park for Aldi/Lidl etc.

The hotel staff were friendly.

The breakfast was a buffet style breakfast in which was tasty and you could have as much as you like. There was hot cooked breakfast including bacon, sausage, black puddings hash browns, beans etc… and cold continental breakfast including cold meats, bread and other foods. There was also fresh juices available as well as a bean to cup coffee machine.",5,2024,08,27
249,Great Hospitality,"Everyone in the Gusto Restaurant was so helpful and friendly! Especially Sakshi, Sarah Jane, Aisling and Ashley. Sakshi was very accommodating and squeezed my family and I in despite there being a huge group booked in for dinner. Sarah Jane had a very bubbly attitude was very helpful and made us feel welcome. Aisling was so lovely and sweet. Overall they were so hospitable despite us having so many requests. Deirdre at reception did great at setting a positive atmosphere for our stay.",5,2024,08,25
249,"4 star rating is completely false, more like 2 star","Do not stay here. Leisure area (dressing room/ floor area around pool)is filthy, jacuzzi not working, broken bench in sauna, poor staff, chaotic atmosphere, poor menu, no air con in very stuffy rooms. Large stain on carpet in room. All rooms are interconnecting. A packet of crisps are €3! Elevators are dodgy. No adequate seating area in the lobby/ bar for families staying.",1,2024,08,21
249,Really Disappointing,"This was our third time staying at this hotel, unfortunately the hotel has gone downhill and we wouldn’t stay here again. 

Breakfast is not great, they do pancakes which our children love but they don’t do Nutella instead they have a dark chocolate sauce which isn’t nice and the selection of cereal is very poor. 

The bedrooms need updating, there was a big crack in the sink in the bathroom. The bath didn’t look very nice either. Rooms are hot as no air conditioning and they are small for a family of four. The beds are comfortable. They have fans in the bedroom that you can plug in but they are not great. 
Dinner menu is only ok.
No entertainment for kids.

On our first night we were woken at 2am in the morning by the people in the room beside us, they had the tv up to the last, talking at the top of their voices, banging doors, I rang reception at 2.30am to complain as these people had woken up our kids, reception didn’t seem to care, They said they would send security up to the room to ask them to quieten down but they never sent security, there is an interconnecting door between the two rooms so I ended up knocking on the interconnecting door to try and get them to quieten down. Told reception the following morning, got an apology but that was it, they said that guest was checking out that morning. 

The second night we were also woken up by a crowd of people coming back from the pub talking at the top of their voices, someone in one of the rooms near us kept dragging chairs across the timber floor in the middle of the night and woke us up both nights, all bedrooms have timber floors so the chairs been pushed around the floor make an awful noise. The chairs should either be taken out of all the bedrooms or put something on the legs of the chairs to stop them from making so much noise. 

People are constantly banging doors even in the middle of the night. 

I think their should be signs put up or emails sent out about respecting other guests and that the hotel do not tolerate noise in the middle of the night/early morning out of respect for other guests.

House keeping are outside the bedrooms early in the morning hoovering the hall, check out is 11am so I guess they are trying to get as much cleaning done as they can for the people checking in. 

Very disappointed stay after paying nearly €800 . A refund would have been nice for the first night if it had  been offered as we hardly got any sleep and it wasn’t our fault. Very tired after coming home as it was meant to be a relaxing weekend away.

If your looking for a quiet relaxing weekend away this hotel is not for you. Busses also pull up outside at 4am in the morning to take people to the airport so we could also hear the noise of the busses from our bedroom. 

The hotel also charge for car parking, I think it is €10 per night. 

It is a very busy hotel as they get a lot of people coming from the airport if their flights get cancelled or people staying the night before their flight. 

Hope this review helps.",2,2024,08,19
249,Very disappointed,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times with no problems,but this time is such a let down, our room is divided from the next room with just a door with a gap under, the first night they had their TV blaring at 12 at night and also cooking of some kind, the smell even came under the door,we could hear them talking on the phone. the next few nights we've had kids running up and down the corridors shouting and banging doors, it's a shame as we always enjoyed staying here when we visited family,but this will be our last time, staff were very friendly though.",2,2024,08,15
249,disappointing breakfast,Parsley on every part of the cooked breakfast my children refused to eat any of it because it was all green they resorted to pancakes where there was no nutella only chocolate sauce that you put on ice cream these tasted very eggy try didn’t eat them either also the yoghurt in the fridge was warm so was the fruit very disappointing,2,2024,08,15
249,Very disappointing,"Second time staying here. The first time with a two year old so they put us on the ground floor, the noisiest, loudest floor so toddler was kept up all
Night by people running past, shouting, singing, screaming. 
We complained so they gave us a complimentary night. 
Which is tonight.
Went totally he restaurant I stood waiting for 20 minutes as no one seemed to know what to do. Sat at my table for twenty minutes before even asked do I want a drink. 
Ordered beef rage and garlic bread. Simple enough. It arrived. Watery, tasteless, pale beef in a linguini pasta and frozen garlic bread which was sold.  Cost about €40
Come back to my room to have a nice match and no hot water. Called reception they’re sending someone straight up. 25 minutes later I call again, they’re getting someone straight up…still sat here another 15 minutes later and no show of anyone and it’s 10pm now.
My mother is in a suite. Let’s just say it definitely isn’t anything special. Stains on the walls. The decking on balcony is old and tired and bare absolutely nothing on there not even a chair which basically sums up the room. It’s big but bare. Not even a complimentary shower get. The shower leaks and sprays out all over the floor. Not exactly what you’d expect for a suite.
Spoke to another guest at the restaurant he wasn’t impressed either he even told me the plaster is falling off the walls in his room.",1,2024,08,12
249,Great value for money with friendly staff,"Stayed here for 1 night as a family with 3 young children. Was ideal for us to arrive in the evening and have dinner after a day at the zoo and then we were off again the next morning to Fort Lucan. 
I had booked a 1 night bed and breakfast deal with 2 course dinner included. It was excellent value for money. The dinner and breakfast were very good. Staff were all so friendly and helpful.
Great spot!",5,2024,08,03
249,Not family size accommodation like advertised ,"Ive never wrote a review before but this hotel actually upset me so much in a week that was meant to be special, my 40th birthday and multiple birthd meet up, Upon booking a family room through booking.com for a meet of multiple births group we rang the hotel to enquire as it showed that we booked 2 adults 2 children and one baby .like what was adversitied as a family room we rang them explained have twin premie boys whom both sleep togther in our crib , we where advised that the room FAMILY ROOM would not hold the travel cot for twin boys even though on booking.com it was 2+2plus baby yet now suddenly to add our second baby we would have to pay an extra 600 euro for interconnecting rooms really bad form on multiple birth families .absolutely heart breaking and to the multiple births group that advertise these as family friendly now must reconsider as this as crazy .the same crib that is used for one is used for two we bring our own but they still wouldn't except our family how sad is that .",1,2024,08,02
249,Can they learn how to clean a room?,"Very polarizing service.  Some staff absolutely brilliant (eg a Filipino lady at dinner and most of the check in staff) to some staff who were almost rude.  Poor training I believe.   

The rooms need a bit of an upgrade but the worst was that my room wasn't cleaned on one of the days  even when I asked 4 times.  I even went to the desk and they said it's been cleaned since you've been out and if it's not they will clean it - they didn't.  And when it was finally cleaned (the next day)  they only make the beds and change towels.  The coffee mugs were put back to their original place BUT still dirty!  Floors never vacuumed and benches not wiped down.  I'm not 100% the sheets were even changed.  

The restaurants food was OK and the breakfast was very good. 

The bar prices were expensive and this is a from a person who visits Ireland every year.  

If you're staying 1 night this place would be OK.  However it seems once you're in they don't really care about you.  

Also their carparking was broken and a group of us couldn't leave the hotel.  This happened a few times.",2,2024,08,01
249,Great airport hotel!,"Lovely staff, did their best due to Tui cancellations.dont mind the reviews !! Bed v comfy. Doors are heavy when closing so don’t mind that as fire proof. The Margharitas  pizza is to die for! Lots of Irish staff and very accommodating - a lovely stopover hotel !",5,2024,07,20
249,No sleep… noisy hotel,"As you’ll see in previous reviews… this hotel is far too noisy all the doors BANG and you can hear everything from the next room. The  hotel is expensive and even charge you for parking!! 

Rooms are nice tho but you won’t get much sleep! 

Will not stay again",2,2024,07,17
249,Poor swimming pool arrangements,"When we checked into the hotel ,we were told that the kids were allowed into the pool from 9 am , so my wife and I brought our daughter down to the pool at 9 am the morning after , when we were in the pool there was some sort of aerobic class starting at the other end of the pool which was fine as we were at the other end of the pool,as time went on they started moving up to the side we were in and then one woman asked a few of the kids to get out of that side of the pool as well and they did , she then approached me and also asked me my wife and daughter to move to the lanes side of the pool, I said I wouldn't as my daughter wasn't good enough swimming to be in that side ,that pool is open at 7 am in the morning and why couldn't they have the class before 9am when the kids are allowed into the pool, the person who was running the class also asked us to move out but I refused , I thought it was a disgrace that they were asking kids to get out of the pool to accommodate them selves, I think it was a class for pensioners as they all looked around 70 or more anyway if ye have kids who like swimming I would stay away this hotel for sure",1,2024,07,15
249,a very decent hotel,"having read some of the reveiws I was a bit worried about our stay, but we honestly experienced nothing like some of the reveiws I have read.
3 of us stayed in a family room with balcony, good sized room and 3rd bed was an actual bed, not camp/foldaway bed, bed was really comfortable. room was big enough for 3 and had everything u need, even iron and ironing board. the bathroom has big bottles of shower gel, shampoo and hand wash which all smell amazing. enough towels were provided with extra in the wardrobe.
 we stayed 2 nights bed and breakfast with dinner one night for a very reasonable price.
the breakfast was lovely, there is nothing more u could want from all the typical bacon/sausage breakfast stuff to cereals, pastries, pancakes, fruit, yogurt, meats and cheeses, everything was replaced frequently so not left to go cold and crispy.  help urself to a choice of juices, coffee and tea.
we had dinner in the Globe resturant and again, this food was lovely, presented well and fresh and staff were quick to seat and serve us.
the leisure centre was a huge added bonus. the pool was great and it also has a small children's paddling pool, sauna, steam and jacuzzi. the gym my husband used and he said it was really good. none hotel guests use the gym and pool so that says enough on how good it is. they do have children's swimming lessons on throughout the day but 7-9pm is adults only.
all of the staff we encountered were really nice and friendly and couldn't do for enough for u, reception were really helpful when I had an issue regarding our hire car and went out of their way to help.
my only criticisms are:-
when staying overnight u still have to pay for parking, this should be included in the price.
there is a lack of bins around the hotel, there is none in the reception/waiting area at all which means people just leave rubbish on the tables. 
the bedroom doors need to be fitted with a softer close mechanism or foam around the door as all u hear is the loud banging from the doors. the walls are also paper thin and u can hear everything going on in the next rooms.
the shower in the bathroom needs to be a handheld not a rainfall shower- for women who don't want to wash their hair twice a day this is a bit tricky with the rainfall shower.
we would definitely stay here again if we come back to Dublin.",4,2024,07,06
249,Very Comfortable and efficient,"Stayed in the hotel with extended family. Car parking very handy , check in fast, rooms lovely and clean. We ate in the bar, nice food and while breakfast was very busy it was handled excellently. Used the machines to check out and had no issues. Noticed a leisure club but didn’t use it, next time.",5,2024,06,17
249,Too noisy,"Staying here right now, trying to sleep for a long day training. 7 am the gym beside the hotel with a loud music. Expensive hotel and no parking included, had to pay for it. Too noisy all night. Had a horrible night sleep. Room is lovely, good space.",2,2024,06,13
249,Exceptional Service from F&B Team,"Had an amazing time at this hotel! Rooms were super clean and staff were really attentive. Great location with shops and entertainment only a 10 minute walk away. 

Shout out to Caitlin and Roman on the F&B team for being AMAZING during dinner service both nights! They were extremely helpful and super friendly and made my stay here even more enjoyable. 

Would come again if I visit Ireland!",5,2024,06,11
249,Game Changing Hotel,"Excellent hotel. Well run with excellent staff. We had a sports team there and all had a wonderful time. We visited the swimming pool as a group, and were really looked after by Cathal and team. After that Maria in the restaurant looked after our large group seamlessly. There vitality breakfast is one of the best I have ever had. A fantastic selection of food types. This has turned into a one the most fantastic faithful hotels in all ireland.
Would highly recommend.",5,2024,06,04
249,Great Stay,"Great stay-would recommend 
We had dinner in the restaurant both nights and Sabrina was absolutely exceptional! She really above and beyond. 
Maria was in training in the restaurant when I went to pay and despite it being her first day she was so confident and friendly, as was the F&B Manager Pawel who took the time to have a great chat with us.",5,2024,05,29
249,Sabrina is a great team member!,"Brilliant stay! Staff were all very professional and accommodating and service was great. We got upgraded on arrival by the lovely reservations/reception team to a large room which was fabulous. Sabrina in the restaurant looked after us so well, she’s an asset to the team, as well as Pawel the manager. Great food and cocktails. Overall great stay and would highly recommend anyone to stay here. Will be back.",5,2024,05,29
249,Birthday bliss,"Jess was our waitress in restaurant superb service friendly and engaging a real gem. Lovely birthday plate n cocktails too x
Comfy room and great leisure centre 
Chilled in reception area after
Great buzz around the hotel
Will def be back for return visit",4,2024,05,25
249,resonable price when booked through supervalu site.,"stayed here recently as my daughter was attending a competition in the Sports Ireland campus and I managed to get a family room here on a supervalu deal which worked out resonable.  The location is good as its very close to liffey valley shopping center and just off m50.  Our room was fine for 1 night.  It had 2 single beds and a double,  To be honest a lot of rooms offer sofa beds in family rooms so its nice to actually get beds as opposed to sofa beds or camp beds so this was a definite plus.  The room was pretty clean...toilet was stained from just being old and the TV was very glitchy but other than that it was adequate.  Breakfast was poor quality but to be expected unfortunately in a chain hotel.  I would stay again purely for its value for money and location. Not somewhere i would chooses if looking for a nice hotel with a bit of luxury.  its just not that kind of hotel.",3,2024,05,21
249,Terrible,"We Stayed here on the 12th of April for One NightlAwful Hotel.Staff were very Unhelpful,Unfriendly and Uprofessional.Our Room was 160 for the Night yet they wanted another 250 deposit which didnt make sense.Hotel fire alarm went off three times throughout the Night so we didnt sleep much.Not clean enough to be a four star hotel.Will Never stay Here again and wouldnt reccomend!!!",1,2024,05,18
249,Globe Restaurant and Bar,"My girlfriend and I ate dinner at the Globe Restaurant and Bar at the Clayton Hotel in Liffey Valley,  and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the 10oz ribeye steak and the peppercorn sauce was delicious! She had the house salad and it was delightfully fresh and crisp. The two different desserts were the icing on the cake. Last but not least, our server Jess, was an outstanding server. She was very personable and very sweet. Made other suggestions to us as well for things to do while we are Dublin. Thank you!",4,2024,05,17
249,Clean hotel,"We stayed in the clayton for one night as a family. It is ideally located. It has easy access to everything. Walking distance from liffey valley shopping centre and loads of food places and coffee shops around the hotel so dead handy with family. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the room and of the hotel in general. I found the room smallish but very clean which is so important to me.

However, the service in the bar wasn't great to be honest. Staff weren't on the ball. We were sat there with no menus and staff seemed to have no interest in serving us. We weren't even given forks and knives for our food until after the food had arrived. It was just a slack feeling there. 
Guards were in the hotel which didn't go unnoticed by us.

However the leisure centre was good and as I say it was clean. We used it as a space to put our heads down after a visit to the zoo and liffey valley shopping centre. So I would recommend for this reason. However it's not family friendly hotel. Like there's nothing for kids except the pool. And no relaxing lounge Area as such. It gives more of a business vibes hotel. I wouldn't stay in it for more than 1 night with family. 

Accommodation service were there first thing the next morning and she was lovely and friendly.
I didn't find staff across rest of the hotel particularly warm and friendly.",3,2024,05,10
249,Avoid room 229!,"Booked family room last minute. Big and spacious plenty of room. But unfortunately we were right behind the lift and it was extremely noisy all night!! 😴 avoid room 229 especially with small families!
Safe to say we didnt get much sleep! As for facilities…… good for families, bit dated.",2,2024,05,06
249,Fantastic Family Experience,"Good location and well communicated with the city centre. 
The staff cares a lot for guests. Leah, Deborah and Deirdre from reception did their BEST to help and make of our stay a wonderful experience. 
Great professionals! 
Sharon and Tara from the restaurant were also very kind and attentive. 
Both the food and the accomodation exceeded expectations.",5,2024,04,30
249,Simply shocking,"Hate giving negative reviews, however … unfortunately I’ve no choice but to give this hotel a somewhat negative review as it gives the impression it craves nothing but a ‘negative review’… it’s so bad in its main social area The Globe bar and in the breakfast department it’s hard to root out positives but I’ll try be as balanced as I can. 
It presents as ‘staff just don’t care or are poorly trained which in fairness lays in the fault of management.  
Ok, First the positive, front of house staff are slow to check in and allow queues to form, very pleasant however and the ladies I met were obviously experienced know how to make you feel welcome, so plus plus plus.. reward these people… The Staff member who ‘half heartedly’ promote self service check in don’t really believe in it. (I don’t blame them) need to be trained as to its benefits which will reduce queue. 
Room was fine all the usual comfort no complaints. 
The bar/restaurant- no words,in fact I do “Absolutely Shocking” start to finish, this group of people just don’t care. Here is the list,
Customer’s left standing for an extended length of time at a lectern with a cheap laminated sign saying ‘please wait to be seated’ only to be met by a staff member who either could not seem to pick a table full of empty tables or make any sign of eye contact or pleasantries say, ‘come on’ and lead customer to a table. 
Seen staff wander round with shirts hang out of trousers. Flick trays out pure
boredom they dropped onto floor making noise and dropping glasses. 
At 10pm I ordered a round of drinks only to be told ‘They had run out of Guinness’ I was shocked and the further shocked to hear a bar stay say when questioned by another customer how could a bar in Ireland run out of Guinness say ‘welcome to the Clayton’ like this is a regular occurrence. 
I’m Irish and I was extremely disappointed when the bar full of a European sports team for example expecting to drink our one of our finest beverages only to be told ‘We have ‘run out’? I was so disappointed and then to hear staffs flippant remark then to hear a tourist say ‘wow Ireland i’s a joke’ how could they run out of Guinness?? This hotel bar clearly do Not care. 
Decor, paintwork is shameful in the Globe bar. Pain brush marks on door frames dust and dirt everywhere. Christmas decorations still up in places in April. Dirty stains on bar lounge chairs. Ceiling filthy especially round vents.
The hotel needs a deep overhaul and a deep clean, staff need a huge training drive  I don’t blame them I blame their training. 
Breakfast again, quite frankly shocking. Food not replenished on regular basis. Coffee was terrible burned beyond any acceptable limits in its coffee urn. 
On way back to my room I overheard a grouper staff complaining about how overworked and burned out they are as they walked by my room. This definitely is evident. Won’t be staying here again, terrible.  
€7 for a pint of Guinness and €3.50 for a small bag of peanuts … unbelievable cheek given the state of the place.",1,2024,04,24
249,Never again,"Pool changing room floor filthy, restaurant was chaotic with what seemed like very inexperienced staff leaving tables unattended and not taking orders. Place in general seems a bit tired , pool it’s self is very small and was packed while we were there.",1,2024,04,20
249,Friendly Staff,"Stayed for one night during the Easter break with two children. 

Hotel was quite busy.  Self check in kiosk was quite easy to use so it sped up the checking in process. 

Room was clean. Beds were comfortable. Restaurant staff were friendly and efficient. Food was quite nice. 
 
Deirdre on the front desk was very friendly and helpful. 

The only complaint I have is the smell of smoke during the night. It's supposed to be a non smoking hotel. I woke up several times during the night to a strong smell of cigarettes and weed. 

Breakfast was very nice. Again the dining hall staff were very friendly and attentive. 

It's just a pity about the smoke smell.",4,2024,04,02
249,City Christmas break,"Good hotel, handy location for that side of the city and for Liffey Valley shopping centre. We had a good room, it was clean and comfortable and had no complaints. We ate there two nights, it was hard to get a table but that’s to be expected in the city and in the run up to Christmas and most of the staff were trying to get us seated as quick as possible. Breakfast was standard and was busy (as advertised and expected) at the later times. We used the pool too, no issues with getting in when we wanted or crowds so it was a good weekend all around.",5,2024,03,23
249,"Top class Hotel, with Ina Duty manager n her team.",Thank u to Ina a Duty Manager from Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley n her lovely team who made my n my friend weekend memorable.

249,Noisy hotel & bad sound proof rooms.,"Sound proofing of the rooms is terrible so if you want a quite stay don’t choose this hotel.
My room had adjoining doors so every noise from the rooms next door could be heard.
The TV's are by the adjoining door so every word could be heard from next door TV.",1,2024,03,04
249,Best hotel and restaurant service,"Clayton hotel Liffey valley is verry good for stay in Dublin, near to leixilip industrial Park as well. The all over facility provided by hotel and restaurant is very nice. At the reception desk Sakshi & Deirdre is very helpful for billing and room booking. reception desk and all over staff of Clayton hotel Liffey valley their service is very good. Rooms are very fresh and clean. Restaurants breakfast food is delicious as well.",5,2024,03,03
249,Make sure you’re insured,"Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid AVOID AVOID AVOID IF you’re not into fighting for the weekend or watching the spectacle.watch police running around the hotel,this probably isn’t for you.if you fancy reporting these problems and dealing with amateurs with no satisfaction this is the place",1,2024,02,27
249,Great hotel amenities and personnel onsite,"Amazing hotel, great personnel, particularly in the Food & Beverage department and in the gym/pool area. Very clean, many great amenities on site...
The only 3 downsides were: distance from the centre and the pillows/mattresses, which were a bit too hard and gave neck/back pain, not good soundproofing of rooms, sometimes it was a bit loud at night when people were walking and talking/laughing in the corridor.",4,2024,02,27
249,Adequate,"Our stay was grand, not fabulous. The bedroom walls could have done with some touch ups and there was lots of stains in the carpet. The bathroom however was modern and very well kept. The shower gel dispensers almost empty, it was impossible to get any out. There was lots of noise on the corridor at night, slamming of doors and children running up and down. Breakfast was OK, enough to keep us going. The hotel is situated right beside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and there is a bus stop near by for buses into Dublin City Centre. We found the hotel's location just off the M50 ideal for us when getting in and out of Dublin. The hotel is classified as a four star, I would give it 3 stars.",3,2024,02,27
249,Amazing experience,Upon arrival I was greeted by the reception staff who were very polite and professional. A massive thank you to Deborah Roxana Lindsey and Courtney for their incredible knowledge of Dublin and going the extra mile to ensure my stay was great,5,2024,02,26
249,Awful.Would not recommend for families,Booked this hotel as we were coming with children.Awful experience. Absolutely no sleep all night with teenager running around hotel banging on doors.I phone reception at 2pm. Kids bottle top from previous family left in room on our arrival.My sister who had booked another room with her kids couldn't contact reception to complain as no phone in her room.No one got any sleep all night. Felt uneasy walking around the hotel and having breakfast. The pool was packed and very rough behaviour in pool.Definitely will not be bringing our family back to this hotel again.,1,2024,02,17
249,Super Sakshi,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend. On the Saturday morning I awoke tired and not feeling great, but witnessed a member of staff, Sakshi, working on reception going way above and beyond. There was a young woman (who I did not know) that was in quite a bit of distress in the lobby, but Sakshi dealt with her as if she were her own sister. Her understanding and empathy was just incredible to witness. She then helped me out with a shaving kit and a tooth-brushing kit, as I had forgotten to bring them, before pointing me towards the breakfast area. I found her to be so incredibly helpful and professional that I had to take the time to mention it here. Front of house staff are very important - as they often give the first (and lasting) impression. If the rest of the staff here are anything like Sakshi, then this must be a truly fabulous hotel!
Thank you Sakshi for making my day and for sending me off in such a good mood last Saturday - you were super!",5,2024,01,31
249,"Food and drink very expensive , hotel needs to cut its prices and upgrade food","We stayed here to meet family and celebrate my sons 13th birthday. Food and drink very expensive and  food only ok.  The rate for the January sale was very good, but the food and drink was very expensive for what it was . The hotel location is in middle of nowhere so you are limited to hotel to eat.
We had a burger and it was tasteless with a bare bit of bacon and cheese and a few overcooked chips for 22.00 each. A pint of Bulmer's was € 8.10. A bowl of ice-cream was 9.00 euros, with 3 scoops.  A bottle of basic cheap house white wine was 38.00 or a glass was 8.20. A margherita  pizza, which you could only get to room, and wasn't on menu , was 25.00 and was tasteless and burnt underneath. The place was freezing and had to complain to get the heat on in bar area.  The room was nice and clean , but that's what you expect as a minimum for a hotel room. It was an expensive night there, and we wouldn't be staying there again. We were very disappointed.",2,2024,01,15
249,Getting worse and worse,"This place used to be okay. Just to get your head down for a night or two. However over the past couple of years it's just got progressively worse to a place where its really very bad. 

I stayed last night, checked in late and was up early for work. Water pressure so low the shower couldn't operate. Rooms are tired and in need of refurbishment. Sink wouldn't drain due to some sort of plumbing issue. 

Even in a cheap hotel, I expect to be able to get a decent shower. 

Lift call button doesn't work....I could go on and on. 

They've massively lowered the rates over the past few weeks, but unless you are absolutely desparate, I'd give it a swerve. I will be.",2,2024,01,15
249,Terrible,"I don't even know where to start, stayed at this hotel in the past and to say it has gone downhill is an understatement!  Dirty hotel, dirty tables, asked to have the tables cleared of glasses and cleaned, receptionist just smiled at me, don't think she could speak English, or maybe she could and decided not too understand me. Empty chinese bags and take away  pizza boxes thrown on the floor, nobody in sight to clean up anything . Stay away at all costs. Pay a bit more to stay at a decent establishment! ",1,2024,01,01
249,Would not stay again! ,"We are here now and  had to leave a review. While the hotel is clean.. it is very outdated with long dull halls everywhere! The food was very expensive for what we got. I ordered a buttermilk chicken burger from the menu and it was certainly not a 
 buttermilk chicken burger, was processed and more like a frozen chicken burger! For this chicken burger and chips, fish and chips, plate of chips for a child and 2 scoops of icecream.. 2 minerals and a vodka and 7up we were charged over €72.. I do not mind paying for good food.. but the standard of this food was not worth it at all!!
The room is also the least soundproofed room I have ever stayed in.. I can clearly hear every word spoken in the room next door!!! Avoid if you plan on getting yourself or kids to sleep! ",2,2023,12,27
249,Very disappointed!,"On arrival I went to pay with cash only to be told that if I was I would have to pay a €200 cash deposit also which wasn't stated in my confirmation email & I showed the receptionist the email. I asked if there was an BOI ATM near by to lodge money because she had told me if I paid by card there would be no deposit charged. Receptionist advised me to go to liffey valley that there was one, while having to bring a baby & a 7 & 9 year old with us to look for one, after unloading luggage into the lobby! Anyways, went to liffey valley, no ATM only permanent tsb, rang the hotel and a different receptionist answered & said that even if we wanted to pay by card there would still be a €200 deposit! Requested a birthday plate for my daughter who was 7 & was highly disgusted by what was left in the room which went uneaten, a gone off cheese cake with the writing dripping, we had requested a selction of mini desserts! The noise of like someone banging on a wall with a hammer that went on most the night was bad, when mentioned to the receptionist she asked did we ring to complain, there was no answer from the reception when we did. When checking out was told we would have to wait 10-15 minutes for our room to be inspected before we could get our €200 deposit back! When leaving my daughter stood in sick outside the front door infront of the big flower pot before getting in to our car to leave which was parked to the side. Would never stay here again even if it was free! ",2,2023,12,17
249,Lovely hotel within a 5 minute walk of Liffey Valley Shopping centre ,"This is our 2nd time staying at clayton liffey Valley, and it won't be our last. We stayed in a family deluxe room, and there was plenty of room for our family of 4. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and this made our stay extra enjoyable. We booked a dinner package, and the food was spectacular, I would definitely recommend that if you stay to book with a dinner package, you will not be disappointed, there is a choice or starter and main or main and dessert. There is a menu for adults and kids, so there is something for everyone! After dinner, we sat in the globe bar and had some cocktails that were top-notch! The hotel has a play area for smaller kids on the first floor, which was ideal for our 9 month old. We saw a cinema room across from this but we didn't go inside. The pool in the hotel opens at 9am, and it has a kids pool and a main pool, and access to this is included in the stay. The hotel is within a 5 minute walk of liffey Valley shopping centre, so it is ideal for anyone who is looking to go to Dublin for a shopping trip.",5,2023,12,12
249,Hotel needs improvement but location is great.,"Hotel is tired looking, stale smell on entering the front door. The tables in the lobby on the right were dirty & crisp/sweet papers on the ground. Breakfast poor. You need a cleaner in the lobby all the time.
I have stayed here many times over the years but hotel has gone downhill.",3,2023,12,11
249,Last minute Booking to attend an event.,"What can I say 1st impressions did not particularly hold up.  

Booked last minute as we were attending an event at Dublin Zoo & decided we didn't wish to drive 2.5hrs home late in evening. 

On checking in via email you receive another email to say when your room is available you will receive and email with a pin so you can check in using the pods in reception.  Never received.  So therefore had long wait with people jumping queue to check in.  Staff weren't particularly bothered or in any rush. 

Had emailed the hotel to inform them our daughter was in a wheelchair to not receive any response. Communication was pretty poor.

Only one if the two lifts was working.  Noisy corridors.  Bathrooms not particularly well cleaned. 

Breakfast - well we did mention this to a manager.  They placed fresh food out regularly but took the stale over heated food and placed it on top.  Completely put us off eating breakfast which we had paid for.  We left after a few bites. As I said we spoke with supervisor in the lift and he really didn't seem overly concerned. 

Pool - children absolutely loved the pool both kids and deeper pool.  We had to ask attendant for access to disabled toilet/ changing area as locked to then end up using our mobile phone torches as light was broke.  Pool assistant did do his best to change bulb/ find maintenance, even tried Christmas lights to bring light to the room.  He was so kind & apologetic.  

Parking fee of €8 for car park with only a few disabled spots. 

For a last minute stay it's positives would be location to city (20min to Zoo) very little traffic & amenities close by Burger King, KfC, Starbucks & shopping centre.  Beds comfortable.  

Rooms a little dated.  Cleaning staff at your door at 9am ready to kick you out for cleaning. 

Would stay Room Only again purely for location. ",3,2023,12,10
249,Construction work unacceptable ,We stayed with our 3 children for 2 nights. We booked a family suite. We were never told there would be room renovations on the whole floor. The hallways were covered in clingfilm. My son was sick the first night and we were woke by drilling and hammering at 8.30 am. I complained when we were leaving to go out and the lady at reception said she would tell the workers not to start as early the following morning. My kids couldn't even watch the t.v the noise was so bad. The next morning there was no noise which was good. I still think the hotel should compensate guests for things like this as its not the stay we paid for. Just not what you would expect from an established hotel.  This was our third stay here but I don't think we will return as I don't think the customer service is up to scratch. ,2,2023,12,09
249,Dung pit,"Absolute dung pit. 

The worst bar service I've ever experienced. No cop on to identfiy who has been queuing longest, unwelcoming and overpriced. 

Families put on the same floor as parties returning at all hours. 

Dirty, tired and long corridors or nothingness. 

Stay somewhere else.",1,2023,12,09
249,Disappointed ,"
(No title)
Sorry to say but very disappointing stay.  This is not a 4-star Hotel, in any way! Parking is charged.   The Christmas Tree on entering is gorgeous.  Without it, the reception area is cold and unfriendly.  2 staff members were working.  The lady that booked us in was very nice. The bedrooms we were down 2 very long, tired and won halls. No bit of joy in the hall, all very drab and soul destroying.  Laminate floors in the bedroom.  The bed was comfy and cosy.  The sheets were marked and torn in small areas.  The Duvet cover was marked, when we changed it around it was also slightly marked at the other side.  Brown hair was in the bed.  None of us have brown hair.  The bathroom was clean as was the rest of the bedroom.  We could clearly hear the TV from next door. The dining area and bar is also cold and basic.  You would not be enticed to stay any bit longer than you have too. The staff behind the bar were very nice. The queue was long for Breakfast, and we were early, around 8.15am.  A lot of the tables were empty they just did not have the staff to clean them or meet people at the counter.  Our table was not set, we had to go looking for cutlery and someone to get our tea & coffees. The choice of breakfast was ok.  One poor woman was doing the work of ten, she was brilliant.  On going to the swimming pool, they had no towels left.  The guy working there was very apologetic and nice, but it was a long trek back to our rooms for a towel, resulting in two of us not bothering to go for a swim.  The pool packed.  Overall, the three of us very disappointed in this stay. It was a special stay over for Christmas in Dublin and we paid a good price, thinking we were getting a 4-star hotel as the Clayton in Wexford is lovely but this hotel is soulless with no creature comforts.  Not worth the price we paid for it.",2,2023,12,06
249,One of the worst.,"I'm here right now, corridors have dirty plates outside rooms and smell of cannabis. 
Dirty laundry everywhere at 6pm when I checked in. Generally grubby feel to the place. Confusing room numbering system, rooms starting with a 5 are on the 3rd floor etc. 
Lift out of order. 
My bathroom sink is blocked. The place has the feel that I don't want to unpack my stuff in case I need a fast getaway 😆. 
Restaurant food seems decent.
But overall, nah, don't bother.",2,2023,12,04
249,Dont waste your money,3rd time staying here. Again disappointed. 1st time i stayed here when we checked in there was a footprint high up on the wall and broken glass from a picture frame above the bed. Was moved to a smaller room and housekeeping walked straight into the room no knock while i was getting ready. Complained and manager asked me to stay here again and he promised to upgrade for free. Stayed 2nd time and was put in a suite no issue. Stayed here 24th November. Got here after 9pm.Checked in by a rude receptionist who couldnt find our reservation.  She was irritated by other guests asking to be let into the corridor to the elevators. Teenagers running up and down the halls until after 12.30am and then woken at 7am by people with young kids on their way to breakfast shouting. Obviously the hotel cant help the kids shouting but the teenagers could of been reprimanded. Woke that morning to find a blood stain on the outside of the quilt we had slept under that had been hidden by the throw on the bottom of the bed. Large wine stain in the carpet at the side of the bed and the shower curtin was filthy and what looked like black mould on the tiles by the shower. I complained on check out and was told to wait for a manager. Then was told manager in a meeting and would call me back. No one has called me back ive given ample time. Dont waste your money staying here its basic and dirty. Clearly no one cleans the rooms properly. I dont go for fancy hotels im always happy with clean and basic hotels but this just left a sour note.,1,2023,11,27
249,Please don't book,"Rude staff.. paying cash?? €200 deposit, not pleasant or helpful, dirty rooms, awful breakfast wasn't busy but still couldn't manage to get food out into the self service trays at the same time, toilets in lobby has cleaning sign up pretty much all the time, rough crowd hanging around the reception door with bouncer's staff and night, food in the restaurant sub standard, which is not fit for purpose to small slow motion staff and rude also heedless, couldn't wait to get my children out of there, one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in, ",1,2023,11,26
249,Amazing staff member,"My family stayed here recently and had a lovely experience. Our family room was fantastic, spacious and perfect for ourselves and our three kids but the best part about our stay was the wonderful Martina who went above and beyond to assist us when our little girl managed to get into an elevator alone and went missing in the hotel. She found our girl, looked after her and kept her calm and was so kind and caring to us all as we were very upset at losing her for those few minutes. 
She had been amazing with our kids at check in the evening before too and was chatting with them and showing them the Christmas tree in the lobby.
We would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back to stay again. Huge thanks to Martina who was an absolute angel and is a credit to Clayton Liffey Valley",5,2023,11,26
249,Excellent hotel ,"I was concerned after reading negative reviews but I could not recommend this hotel enough.You need a key card to access the lift so it was safe and secure.Our bedroom a deluxe family room was more like a mini apartment.The staff were very helpful and obliging.The breakfast was lovely and all requests were met in a friendly and efficient manner. I don't usually leave reviews but felt this hotel deserved to be acknowledged for what it it. Great stay,thanks to all",5,2023,11,03
249,Good hotel ,"Good hotel, all clean, lovely staff, have swimming pool, restaurant and bar, staff look well-groomed and friendly , bar recommended, I would especially like to thank Thomas and Ina, helped with chose and gave good advices for menu",5,2023,10,31
249,Very poor,"Stayed here many times before but will never step foot in it again. 

Did not feel safe in this hotel, people loitering around in their pyjamas, hanging in corridors and smoking out windows. 

Food disgusting, stale burger buns.

Place needs a good scrub.

Bar service very poor.

We were woken 3 times during the night with security alarms so there was unsociable behaviour issues. Lastly 4.45 fire alarms went off....and that was it, we packed up and left. 

Irish Hotels have changed for the worse",1,2023,10,28
249,"Comfy Bed, good shower","We stayed in the Clayton Liffey Valley from Sept 29th to Oct1st. Good points first,very comfy bed and spotless, a good shower.  Breakfast was great and lovely staff.
When we checked in the staff hardly looked at us, they were more interested in getting cake that was in the reception area and the same at checkout, nobody asked if we enjoyed our stay or was everything ok, they couldn't care less.
The room itself is in very poor state and definitely not a 4 star room as you can see from the pictures.  There was only 1 chair and 1 bedside lamp, I rang reception and not long after we did get another chair but no bedside light, there is no main light in the room so the 2 bedside lights are needed.  The bedside lamp we did have was filthy, old and wobbly, bedside locker had sticky coffee marks.  Furniture is old and damaged.  The carpet is filthy with several stains allover.  The curtain was hanging off the rail, overall very very poor, we didn't spend too much time in the room.
We won't be returning to this hotel",3,2023,10,03
249,Dirty room and below average food,"I stayed here with my wife and the experience as a whole was disappointing. The staff at reception upon check in were lovely and there was a couple of signs apologising for the inconvenience while the hotel was undergoing a facelift. You could see the reception area had undergone painting recently with the masking tape on the floor. It’s just a pity they didn’t give the rest of the hotel along with our room a facelift while they were at the reception. There was stains from drinks spilled on the wall behind the tv and there was also stains on the carpet on the floor. There was also what I could only describe as a blood stain on the bathroom door and what looked like urine stains on the bathroom floor. Clearly the bathroom or even the room for that matter hadn’t been cleaned whatsoever before we checked in. On the desk in the room there’s a card stating that the rooms have been kept to the highest standard of cleaning and that our room was cleaned by someone by the name of Rusu. Now whoever she is, she’d want to get the finger out fairly lively because if she calls our room clean she’d want to get her eyes tested because it was nothing short of a an absolute disgrace. We paid €200 for one night which in this day in age in Dublin is a bargain but the least amount we deserve is a clean room. Now onto the food, I know we may be in a cost of living crisis at the moment but I can’t justify paying €69 for the standard of food we got. I ordered the black Angus burger which consisted of a basket of chips along with the burger which I found to be very dry. My wife ordered the fish and chips. The batter on the fish was cremated and literally rock solid and her chips were poisoned with salt so much that she physically couldn’t eat them. Afterwards I actually looked up online the menu for the Black Forge Inn and for the same two items we ate in the hotel restaurant it would’ve been cheaper to eat in the Black Forge Inn which I find remarkable known how good the food is from the reviews I’ve heard. Now it’s one thing to be paying for a hotel room but to be charged €8 for parking in that hotels actual carpark is an absolute disgrace. If you’re looking to stay in a cheap grubby old hotel this is definitely the place for you. We most certainly won’t be back.",1,2023,10,01
249,A warm welcome ,"I booked a 1 night stay for work and arrived late to the hotel. Courtney & Laura on Reception were so friendly and welcoming. They ensured I was happy with my room allocation as I was travelling alone. I was so pleased to see a lovely pizza menu in my room for late room service at 10:30pm, which I gladly availed of after a long day. Breakfast was really good too, lovely service. I will definitely be back! ",5,2023,09,29
249,Bad stay,"Some good aspects - parking facilities are good, staff are all very pleasant and helpful. 

The family room we were given had a strong smell of sewage as soon as we entered, this didn't go away. It was evident where this was coming from with one look into the toilet. The flush wasn't effective at all. 

Baby's cot was dirty with stains all over the sides. 

TV didn't work, the aerial cable was hanging out with nowhere to plug it in and the WiFi wouldn't connect for online TV. 

My food in the hotel restaurant was fine but my wife couldn't finish her chicken and was up that night being violently ill. 

Next time we're in Dublin we'll be staying somewhere else! ",2,2023,09,23
249,Poor.,"Very poor from start to finish. Stayed for 2 nights with wife and child, rooms were horribly warm. No one emptied the bins or left in replacement water/milk. When we asked housekeeping they said no, towels only and walked on.
No one to answer the phone when i rang 5 times that day, breakfast is €15 which they dont serve and had to ask for tea/coffee. 
Wont be back.",2,2023,09,10
249,Terrible experience,"- Family rooms are totally wasted. All the furniture requires maintenance or new furniture, there are water leaks, stains in the curtains...
- Cleaning policy is totally unacceptable. The term ""room refresh"" means that they do nothing at all, sometimes not even taking away the trash! The room was not made properly until the 4th day when we insisted on the reception.
- Upon arrival they made us wait until 4, which me understood as the policy, but we kindly requested a nice room because we were going to stay for more than one week. When we arrived at 7 they gave us ""what they had"" which was a really noisy room facing the highway. When we got to our room there were no toilet paper, no soap, missing towels, and almost no dishes and cutlery.
- We could continue with the unfortunate events (the list is LONG), but just to give you an idea.",1,2023,08,30
249,The worst experience of all Hotels in Dublin,"I stayed here 3 nights for a family break in Dublin as I thought it would be handy being close to the m50. I always stay in other Clayton hotels throughout the city. This has to be my worst experience staying in any Clayton hotel. It was a terrible experience from start to finish. The part of the hotel we were put was used for refugees and economic migrants. The receptionist told us they don't normally put the public down there. I don't have a problem with that really but the noise was bad and we felt out of place. There were people hanging around the hallway everytime we went to our room.

The breakfast was terrible, the orange juice is not orange juice and the coffee tasted like tar. The food was covered in grease and the service was all over the place. 8 euro for parking and you are outside the city is a little bit of a rip off.

Hotels are merely run now to extract as much money from you as possible and give little in return. ",1,2023,08,30
249,Great food and high tech corporate training rooms,Five stars for food and corporate training rooms! Great standard of service every time. Have been using this hotel for 3 years and no complaints.  They have recently renovated the guest bedrooms and they are fab.  ,5,2023,08,23
249,Out of town Hotel,Hotel is well out of town. Breakfast was busy but well managed. Pool area was great for the kids. Close to liffey valley shopping. Had to pay to park my car. Its handy for someone to go shopping. Had to taxi to Zoo.,3,2023,08,17
249,Two night stay ,"Went to the liffy vally Hotel with my wife & four boys & it was fantastic the staff were great, the rooms were clean & tidy, really enjoyed the swimming pool etc the food both nights absolutely lovely hats of to the chef, me & my family will definitely be back & might I say the staff from breakfast from evening meal where brilliant thank you for a lovely relaxing stay ",5,2023,08,15
249,"Bad service, bad location - not recommended","Very disappointing, the reception staff are really not polite, every request or problem is answered rudely and negatively. The rooms are not cleaned 
and the sheets are not changed

We received a room without curtains when the light entered the room and it was impossible to sleep, the reception's answer was that there are no other rooms and there is nothing to do, it is a fault of the hotel employees who did not return the curtains after painting the room",1,2023,08,10
249,A traveler’s opinion,"Nice clean friendly hotel. Slightly dated and a bit shabby in places. Few water leaks here and there. Rooms were nice and clean, comfortable beds and overall decent. The bar was ok, quite small for a huge hotel but that said was ok finding a seat the couple of nights we used it. Staff are nice, and answer any questions without hesitation. Would I say here again? Yes definitely. The hotel is located very near a hood shopping mall with everything you could need. Transport into the city is easy by bus from the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.",4,2023,08,09
249,Live like a refugee for €250 per night ,"The hotel is full of refugees, I don't think it's appropriate to market this hotel as a family hotel and the place is flooded with refugees. The room was expensive for our stay and that's not good enough. I've stayed here 4 times and always enjoyed my experience here, I think at the time of booking guests should be advised the hotel is partially occupied eith refugees. Went to the pool and was advised swim caps are compulsory. Half the people in the pool didn't have one on. I wouldn't stay here again and would not recommend. ",1,2023,08,09
249,It's a shame as we've had some wonderful stays here over the years.,"Stayed in this hotel loads of times over last 15 years and always thought it was an excellent hotel, however hadn't been here for 5 or 6 years. We stayed here last night and my god, I will not be returning again anytime soon, the service was nothing short of shambolic. We checked in to hotel at 3pm and the room was ready, room was clean as was the bathroom, no complaints there, went down to the pool and despite being really busy, there was no real complaints there, except being made to purchase a swimming cap for my daughter, yet over half the people in the pool had no swimming caps at all. We went in to the bar around 9.30pm  and I had to queue for 25 minutes to get a drink, trust me when i say, there was only 4 people ahead of me in the queue, there is a serious lack of staff issue in this hotel. Breakfast this morning was a shambles too, 20 minute wait to get in to have breakfast, which ok, this happens with a very busy hotel and especially on a bank holiday weekend, but the amount of empty tables that hadn't been cleared off was the reason for this. Also having to wait for food to be replenished in the self service area was a joke. They really shouldn't be taking bookings if they don't have the staff to cover them. We have some wonderful memories  of weekends away when our kids were growing up over the years in this hotel and having to leave a review like this isn't easy, but the service we received last night is up there with the worst we have ever had anywhere. Maybe it's a result of staff shortages, but if the hotel dont address this issue, they are going to be getting more and more people leaving reviews like mine",2,2023,08,07
249,Avoid. 2 star at best,Avoid. Nothing good. Car park is free for all. Buses across disabled spots. Cars on double yellow lines. Hotel hasn't seen any upgrade in years. Strong smell of weed numerous times around grounds. Very noisy. And queue for everything. Online checked in and still have to queue at desk. Queue for breakfast and then no bacon or sausages at buffet for over 10 mins. Signs everywhere telling U it's busy at those times but nobody told the kitchen. And the restaurant is closed in evening and only bar serving food but when booked out they won't serve U at all the empty tables in front of the bar. Rather U went elsewhere.,1,2023,08,07
249,"Excellent Hotel, great location, friendly staff.","I dont usually write reviews but felt this hotel deserved a few moments of my time to express my views on my experience of our stay here.
Stayed here with my wife and 3 kids (aged 6, 3 and 1 year) 
A first class hotel which I cannot fault. From start to finish the whole experience was relaxing and hassle free, just what you need when you're away for a few days.
Parking is convenient with lots of spaces available even at busy times.
Check-in was simple and quick.
The rooms were spotless, very spacious, well equipped and comfortable.
Staff were very pleasant and helpful, they were full of local knowledge regarding places to visit and things to do, even the girl attending our breakfast table had loads of suggestions on how to spend the day. 
Two names I noted were Daniel, the duty manager, and Deirdre on the reception desk. Daniel was keen to ensure everything about our stay was of a high standard and was willing to help with any issues we may have had, he has loads of knowledge on local attractions, which I must add are plentiful and easily accessible from this hotel, examples are Dublin Zoo, Emerald Park, Jump Zone, Aqua Zone to name just a few, he went to the trouble of providing us with information flyers on these attractions which were really helpful when planning a trip. We found all the staff friendly and helpful, they also took time to speak to the children which is always a nice touch.
The food is excellent, breakfast first class with loads of options to please the kids, really a great start to the day.
The kids loved the pool (so did I), great for a wet day when kids are a bit bored and getting out and about isn't an option.
They have a cinema room for the kids which shows a movie every evening at 7.00pm. There is also a wee play zone for the kids which they really enjoy.
The bar is great too, draught beers were good and I thought reasonably priced, food is also beautiful in the bar.
Well stocked vending machines are situated at various spots throughout, always useful if you fancy a snack or a cold drink.
There's a brand new Burger King, KFC and Starbucks immediately across from the hotels front entrance, it's also walking distance from Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and there is a huge Tesco a few roundabouts away by car.
In summary my experience here was a very pleasant one, I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again

249,Excellent service,"Amazing hotel and reasonably priced, the staff are a credit to the hotel they are very helpful and polite. The breakfast was one of the best ive had in a hotel in a long time! Highly recommended.     ",5,2023,07,29
249,Awful stay,"A friend and I booked and stayed in your Clayton Liffey Valley hotel on Friday 23rd of June 2023 and had a horrible experience. 
We left our ground floor room to watch a concert, we returned to find that our room had been broken into. Someone has forced the window open and stolen some of our belongings. My friend and I have spent the entire night terrified that these people would return and have not slept for one moment. We are both young girls and have felt very vulnerable. This has really spoiled, what we planned to be a very happy occasion, spending the night in Dublin and enjoying a concert. 
I think the hotel should be compensating both of us for this horrible experience as the security certainly fell short of what we expected",1,2023,07,10
249,"Good food and service, just bedroom doors to heavy and closed with a bang","Good hotel, just found it to be very noisy as the kids on our floor where going from room to room until 4.30am. The security officers did not do anything.

Also room keys need to be keyed.

Great staff and a clean hotel 

We arrived as part of a four of 52 proplr",3,2023,07,04
249,Awful,"Currently staying at this hotel and unfortunately have another night to go. Arrived and staff were friendly however walking up the halls to the room the dirt of the place is horrendous. Cleaners were in the process of cleaning each room, I walked passed the cleaner trolley and noticed 2 empty glasses on the floor, grapes spilled everywhere and pieces of pepperoni on the floor - came past not long after and these items were still there but the cleaning trolley had left….CLEAN IT UP!!! 
Family room had 1 towel….
Asked for a child’s cot in advance via email, received a confirmation reply yet no cot on arrival. Asked reception about it at around 5pm - come back to the room for kids bed time around 8pm and still no cot…..
Tv channels don’t work. Literally none and when asked about it the reply was “yes most of the channels don’t work” I’m sorry what??? 
Went to the spa and the changing rooms are vile. Dirty tissues lying around the place, all sorts. 
I’ve stayed in Clayton hotels before and have had no complaints but this is so so poor and I’ve only been here for half a day!! ",1,2023,07,03
249,"Very average, skip the breakfast!!","Travel agent helped us chose this hotel and after reading some reviews chose Clayton Liffey.  Rooms was clean and nice bed, but it seemed we walked a mile through looong hallways, up elevators to get to said room.   Ok view of car lot, guess better than parking lot.  $8 nightly rate to park car - WHY??.  Hotel seems to be full and gouging guests with this additional fee is ridiculous!  I must talk about breakfast: charged a fee at check in.  This was the most horrible breakfast we’ve had in all of the 3 countries we visited in this 3 week trip!  No exaggeration.   Warm milk left out on counter for cereal, yogurts and fruit left out at room temperature - just nasty and against all health regulations.!  Warm food (eggs, sausages, thrashersj  - very average.  Do not waste your money on this.  Sorry Liffey, you can do so much better.",3,2023,06,26
249,Can’t fault it.,"Currently staying at the Clayton hotel and can’t fault it.
Really friendly staff on check in. Clean and spacious room. Lovely buffet breakfast, plenty of choice. Staff on hand offering tea and coffee refills. Hotel is in walking distance to a shopping centre and eateries and only a short taxi ride into Dublin centre. ",5,2023,06,24
249,Great staff...,"The hotel is clean and comfy, all the staff are very friendly and helpful. Had breakfast in the restaurant this morning, with plenty of selection. The staff were excellent and again very friend and helpful ",5,2023,06,24
249,Tammy is the best!,The beds are super comfy and the blackout curtains are great. The breakfast is delicious and Tammy is wonderful!! We turned up without a booking (7 of us) 30 minutes before breakfast was due to finish but she sorted us out and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you Tammy! 💚,5,2023,06,24
249,Hen Do,"We’re here for a hen do for the weekend. Breakfast was amazing, Tammy was so nice and helpful. Hotel staff are so friendly. Rooms are lovely and spacious. I would highly recommend staying here, there’s also KFC, Starbucks, Burger King and a night club on the same complex!  ",5,2023,06,24
249,Great stay ,"Fab hotel, prices have sored too much though. 
Spotless clean, rooms are well kitted out. Beds are top marks great sleep. Hotel is waking distance to a busy shopping mall for shops food cinema etc. Not far from Dublin City. 
Big shout out for Loc in breakfast lounge, a brilliant young man who can think outside the box. He was so polite and friendly given us his service. He should be a tutor in table service. Top marks. Food in breakfast lounge was very tasty and lots to choose from. 
Would stay again when prices come down.

249,Stayed  for visit to bloom,"Have returned here several times hotel is so clean  the staff so friendly and helpful

The underground car park is secure for parking up and Liffey valley shopping centre is only short walk away",5,2023,06,03
249,"Location win, but otherwise disappointing ","Some feedback on our experiences: 

Pros:
- staff friendly and helpful especially at reception
- Great location for our needs and 5 mins walk from liffey valley shopping 
- really nice pool and fantastic size kiddies pool. Big changing rooms, busy but kept clean 

Cons
- breakfast very poor. Told to go find a place to sit. There wasn't one, well a clean one anyway. Food very poor, scrambled eggs were terrible. Cold and greasy. 
- food in bar poor also and thought it was overpriced. Got the prawns which were meant to be stirfried but tasted poached. 
- always things wrong with the rooms, all lights went one night, another time Netflix server went down. 
Reception area, corridor seating and bar area run down and needs upgrading. 

Overall very expensive for what your gey.

249,Staff Are So Caring And Kind,"We had an amazing experience here all round from checking in and checking out they allowed us to check in 2 hours early due to being under stress and expecting and allowed us to check out later than scheduled they were beyond accommodating they covered our every need a MASSIVE thank you to Deirdre on reception for being so caring, helpful and understanding in a time of need and for taking a massive stress off of our shoulders and a big thank you to the manager for approving our late check out we can not thank you enough for being so kind and helpful,  we will definitely be back 😀 you went above and beyond for us and we are really appreciative x
God Bless You 🙌 🙏 ",5,2023,05,08
249,A great place to stay for families and anyone who likes good food and nice rooms,"I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. The hotel is a very busy place. Nevertheless, the staff was very friendly and professional staff at the reception where very patient and helpful.

The breakfast offers are very great choice on food and drink. The staff at the restaurant was very quick serving coffee or tea
I had a great time at this place and I would highly recommended",5,2023,05,02
249,Avoid this place but please read why,"Ok, the hotel staff are under pressure from poor management / owners ultimately. 

The room was tidy and presented, bathroom was clean and great hot water. 

However and this is where most of us book a room for….

The mattress was like lying in cotton wool ! If you want to sink in and have a sore back after a nights sleep of no support, then this is the hotel for you. 

€8 car park charge is disgusting when the mattress is soooo bad,

I mentioned it to the reception on checkout and all I got was ‘oh I am sorry to hear that’ 

It’s not her fault, the owner of the hotel has not delivered in the service. 

Book somewhere else, sadly the hotel shortage in dublin makes this difficult,",1,2023,04,23
249,Underwhelming and noisy experience ,The restaurant was closed for dining so we went to the bar. No welcome from staff or invitation to sit down or order drinks. Bar was a gloomy space and felt like a waiting room. Some items on the menu were way overpriced for the setting. We took a walk to Liffey Valley shopping centre instead where there were several nice restaurants to choose from. Breakfast was enjoyable and the staff were very pleasant. Our room was on the ground floor and the noise from the gym was like a nightclub in both the evening and morning. The shower gel was empty. There was a lot of shouting outside the hotel which is beyond their control but definitely was off putting. We cancelled our second booking for the following week despite the location suiting our needs we would rather be elsewhere and drive. The 8 euro overnight parking for guests doesn't instill confidence that guests are valued. Overall an underwhelming and noisy experience.,3,2023,04,21
249,Genuine Staff Who Listen,"A big thank you to all the staff at Liffey Valley Clayton Hotel who made our stay so special.

To Sharon at reception for sorting our issue with the parking ticket. 

To Tara at breakfast for remembering and enquiring about our kids’ adventures from the day before. 

To Sharon in the bar area for reserving us a table for early lunch and remembering all the details our kids shared from the previous day about their trip on the ferry from The Isle of Man to see their cousins etc 

To Dave in Club Vitae for also listening and enquiring about how our kids’ trip to see Super Mario and The Jump Zone went from the previous day.

It is this personal touch that makes a family feel welcome and at home in a hotel. Well done to you all. 

Keep up the great work making your guests feel welcome. It’s the little things that are the big things. 

Kind regards,

It is right that furniture is a little bit old but spirit is better and i like it. Now it looks safe. Good job",4,2023,04,12
249,Unbelievable Care Less Attitude ,"Can’t believe the attitude. A family hotel. Easter weekend. No children allowed in restaurant or bar area after 10. Insufficient seats available outside of the bar and in the large reception area. Lots of empty seats in the bar and restaurant. Manager not prepared to “rearrange the hotel” to accommodate us to permit a table and chairs to be set up outside of the bar. Off to bed,  and somewhere more accommodating next time.",1,2023,04,07

249,Room Maintenance/cleaning VERY POOR,"
Room maintenance/ cleaning is VERY POOR. After two days our dirty coffee cups haven't been replaced, after we've asked for new ones. Our towels that we've hanged up after shower, we've found thrown on my suitcase,not replaced with dry towels. Our bed is half made up, with some cushions lying around in the room . The receptionist isn't very helpful/friendly. We will not recommend Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley to friends/family.",1,2023,04,01

The restaurant was fully book but was not a problem as we ate out
The bar had a good variety of beer and lager

249,Would not recommend,"
Hi, my daughter and I were booked to stay in the Clayton hotel Liffey valley for two nights last weekend. We booked in early Saturday morning, where they understandably said that the room was not ready. They took our bags. We returned at 8pm only to find they had no room available.. the excuse was that there had been a plumbing problem. However, there was many others allocated a room. We do not believe this was their reason. We were asked to stay in their sister hotel in Dublin airport at great inconvenience. They paid for a taxi to bring us to the airport hotel but we were allocated a musty room at 10pm after a very long day!! , with no drinking water in the room, and clearly the room had not been used for sometime. For this we were charged €179 with no breakfast. 

The following morning we returned to the Clayton Liffey valley hotel and the receptionist apologised for the inconvenience and stated that she would include a free breakfast in recognition of the inconvenience. This room was much nicer, however again no drinking water in the bedroom. With regret I must say that breakfast was very poor, and very basic with glasses and cutlery not clean. This is not an acceptable service and I would not recommend it to anyone. The weekend in total cost us €179 for night one and €130 for the second night… this was not cheap for a very poor service and standard of accommodation. 

I would recommend that management review the situation.",1,2023,03,27
249,Not what I expected,"I stayed here for one night with my sister and her 10 year old grandson and had booked a family room with three beds. We arrived at 3.30 pm and we’re greeted by three men at the front door smoking and drinking from beer cans. I found them a bit intimidating and would have driven on by if I hadn’t had a reservation. As check in is 4 pm, our room wasn’t ready, but were assured it would be ready shortly. At 4.15 we enquired about the room and pointed out the men at the front door.  The duty manager was called, he apologised and offered us free breakfast next day and promptly moved the men on.  At 4.30 we’re told room is ready and had been upgraded to family suite as an apology for the delay. Turns out the family suite has one bed and a sofa bed ( contrary to their website which says one king and two singles)  We decided we would make it work and then discovered no bedding for the sofa bed in the room.  Shortly after contacting reception, the bedding arrived, but it was dirty and was replaced. I ‘slept’ on the sofa bed.  The mattress was about 3 inches thick and every bar of the bed frame could be felt through it. I doubt any member of the hotel management has spent a night on one! 
Dinner in the bar was ok.  The food was decent, but the service incredibly slow. Slow to the point that one drink took 15 mins despite being told twice it would be “two minutes”. It was taken off our bill.
The noise in the hotel is incredible and everywhere!  Kids running around shouting and using scooters in the corridors.
The room was clean with a good, hot shower. But I doubt I’ll be back ",2,2023,03,26
249,Well-Located Hotel near Dublin + Wonder Staff,"I was here with a large Marching Band from the USA.  We marched in the St Paddy's Day Parade in Dublin.  The hotel and staff at Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley were terrific.  Upon arrival, management greeted us, and our entire 3-night stay went off without a hitch!  Special Thanks to Nadine and Martina, who, from the beginning of our planning two years ago, have made staying at Clayton Liffey Valley a pleasure.  Finally, our group dinner last night was balanced, tasty, and carried out by a proficient and caring restaurant staff.  Accolades to Sean, Christopher Ngwenya, and Tabushree Mandel at the restaurant for stellar service.  Bravi to all!",5,2023,03,18
249,Great service ,"Wait staff were wonderful. Thomas & Christopher we're attentive and very kind.

249,Great hotel,"I enjoyed my stay here at Clayton hotel Liffey valley, Located not too far from Dublin City. Very clean and comfortable environment and the food was delicious.

249,Best Receptionist  - Ever.,"Arrived at 3.30pm on a cold wintery afternoon having battled snow and manic traffic to be met by Shyanne who was simply wonderful. The kind of Receptionist adverts are made of.  She quickly let us know there was a room ready and efficiently booked us in to a lovely quiet room which was perfect except for being a little chilly (it quickly warmed up though). The hotel was great, food in the bar was good and the staff generally were warm and friendly. Check out the following morning was seamless. The underground car parking rate of €8 per night was terrific and very good value.
Star of the show though was Shyanne. Her empathy for battle weary, exhausted travellers was both a joy and a gift.",5,2023,03,10
249,Very pleasant,"The bed was very comfy. We had a pleasant stay and Deirdre was very helpful the next morning on reception, she answered our queries and was very friendly. Breakfast was also very nice. Overall we had a fantastic stay. ",5,2023,03,07
249,Poor,Corporate stay on 27th February 2023. Regular guest. 20 minute wait to check in. Reception staff struggling. Food poor including breakfast. Drink overpriced. Elevator at rear of reception still not working. Same in December 22. Tv not working. Some very dubious guests....,1,2023,02,27
249,The worst hotel experience I’ve ever had. And I once slept in a bed with ants,"Rather than give a story, I’ll just provide a list of everything that went wrong with our stay

No check in before 4pm??? That’s ridiculous. Have never heard that before. Ended up having to check in at 9pm and had to wait 5 mins while the reception staff were having an argument with each other 

No pen in room - no pens in reception, had to wait 10 mins in bar to get one

No shower hose in bathroom for washing hair

Dated decor, lifts out of order, men’s bathroom had 1 usable cubicle out of 3

Staff have a couldnt care less attitude - ended up having to go back twice to re-program my door key card

Bar full of kids at 10pm running wild with no supervision

Walls paper thin - could hear literally everything either side of us. Horrible to try to have to explain to a 5 year old what’s going on in the next room

Vending machines exorbitant prices €2 for bottle of water normally €1.05 

Couldn’t connect T.V to hotel Wi-Fi (settings were locked with PIN) so was stuck with crappy Irish TV channels when they said that Netflix was available. 

Just a dirty, grotty, dated, over-priced (€190 for one night??!) excuse for a hotel that should be razed to the ground and something else put in its place",1,2023,02,19
249,Honestly not for couples! You won’t get a good nights sleep and can hear everyone’s conversations,"So this is our 4th time staying at this hotel previously it was the clarion… all I can say is each experience has gotten progressively worse… it is by no means a romantic couples hotel! If you’re into no sleep,  kids screaming night and day, house keeping knocking on your door from early morning even when you have late check out and being over charged… then maybe stay here? 

As far as wheelchair accessibility goes we have stayed 4 times over 8years and there has been no upgrades! The bed is minimally raised but the room is small for a powered chair however they do have a good bathroom! 

On the other hand don’t expect much in the way of toiletries it’s just one big pump bottle in the shower… no glasses or water in the room… only plugs on one side of the bed. No menus or QR codes anywhere… had to call reception to find out about the WiFi… over all I would say this place is out of chances with us….",2,2023,02,16
249,Will definately return.,"Stayed at this hotel last night, booked with a friend last year for us and our two teenage daughters  to go up to Dublin for a show.  I saw unfavorable reviews on here last week and was a bit apprehensive to be honest but those doubts were unfounded thankfully. 
We arrived at the hotel early at 10am only expecting to leave the car but were told our room was ready & that we were booked into the suites, check in was fast & friendly.  We had booked a family bedroom so were surprised when we arrived into a two bedroon suite with 2 bathrooms and a spacious living area and more or less fully equipped kitchen.  The suite was absolutely spotless and well equipped it would be great for a family staying for a longer break.  Breakfast had a great choice however as the hotel was fully booked 10am on Sunday morning was bound to be busy but replinshments were somewhat delayed on the hot food but it wasnt a big deal really, very friendly lady doing table service for tea and cofffee with a big smile. Checked out easily online.  Hotel location was great for the shopping centre only a few minutes walk away.  Bus stop (G2) just across the road from the hotel and direct to the city centre.  We came back on the bus into the shopping centre, were hoping to eat at Cosmo but it was fully booked so we went to tesco for drinks and snacks and ordered a chinese delivery from Golden Dragon in Palmerstown Village, very nice food and reasonaly priced.  There is also a starbucks, KFC and Burger King right at the hotel. Will definately stay at this hotel ticked all the boxes.  ",5,2023,02,12
249,Just OK ,"This hotel is badly in need of a revamp.
Our room was clean and spacious. However it was very cold. The radiator was barely warm.. Tea bags, coffee and sugar supplied but no milk!
The corridors were dirty and smelled of damp. Carpets stained, walls marked.
Great location, overnight parking €8,
Overall an air of neglect by the management and for what we paid would expect better. ",3,2023,02,07
249,"Dirty, poor service, the worst experience I’ve had in Dublin.","Cleanliness of rooms poor, initially put in a double room. The bed was blood stained. Move to a suite, however no fridge working, no tea and coffee, room service poor. Noisy, poor service. 
Food not good, bar had kids running all over at 10pm at night. 
No vegan options, despite saying there was. 
Pay for parking.",1,2023,02,05
249,"Great stay, lovely hotel!","We stayed on Saturday night, we got an early check in. Thanks to Lyndsey on reception for sorting us all out! The bar staff are very friendly and attentive, even in such a busy environment our family of 8 felt very well looked after. The leisure club was great fun. The children enjoyed the pool. The temperature was lovely. The breakfast was gorgeous, a lovely selection was available to choose from.",5,2023,01,30
249,Absolutely shocking experience ,"My friend and her 7 year old niece stayed in this hotel last night an it was an absolute nightmare, firstly the milk in the room was passed it's expiry date, grand no problem she rang down for some more she rang reception 11 times from the landline in the room without getting an answer an she also rang from her own mobile thinking there was a technical fault on the phone on the room, in the end she needed to dress the child an go down where there was 3 staff members having a chat, we know it was only for milk but what if there was an actual emergency absolutely scandalous! She explained how she rang so many times and the staff member just replied ""oh really"" eventually she got the milk from reception but asked for teabags as the ones in the room were now dumped as the milk curdled, the receptionist said no problem she would get room service to bring them up as she didn't have any that was at 20:20, 9 o clock I rang to again not have anyone pick up the phone, we went back down and she said oh did they not come yet, she had a very tired an cranky little girl with her who only wanted a cup of tea before bed, 22:00pm they arrived with the tea bags ridiculous no satisfaction what so ever! Secondly we were just drifting off to sleep and a really loud alarm was going off and there was lots of noise and shouting from other guests, there was absolutely no consideration for families and young children i understand that is beyond the control of the staff an these things do happen but there wasn't anyone around to ask about the alarm there wasn't any effort to control the noise and shouting it was just chaotic. The next morming they went for a swim before hand they asked what time breakfast finished at and were told 11 they finished swimming headed back to the room an got ready for breakfast with time to spare they relaxed for a little bit, they heades down for breakfast at 10:40 to then be told it stops at half ten, nobody knew what they were doing she would have been there on time if she was told the correct time! My Friend spoke with the manager the next morning an explained everything after she said everything he asked him to email it to him, absolute disgrace she has stayed in other Clayton hotels an was never treated like that",1,2023,01,29
249,Bad experience,"Rooms ok, no room cleaning even though the room cleaning sign was out for a multiple night stay - cleaners came into the room and put a new towel in the bathroom but the bed not made, cups not cleaned etc.
I checked in on Sunday and the reception was very good service and quuet, but Monday, Tuesday evening large check in queue from 6pm.
The small bar they have is a disgrace and the staff don't care less. Long long queues between 6:30 and 8:30, the staff seem to do everything and anything other than serve customers. Dinner plates, glasses etc still on tables hours later. Needs a overhaul as potential is to make it goid. ",2,2023,01,17
249,Management issues,"Stayed here with a friend and our 2 kids to visit the Wild Lights and to be able to do shopping in Liffey Valley.  Room was ready upon arrival and that was great.  I had said I changed to arriving by train and they said the 8 euro parking would be refunded, I am still waiting for a refund.  Main issue was the people staying in the room across from us. Kids playing in the hall late at night.  Screaming at each other in the middle of the night and the fight continued in the room.  Completely not the hotels fault. I would not have marked them down on that.  The issue is how the hotel dealt with the complaints.  The following morning after breakfast I overheard another family complaining to the hotel manager how they had gotten no sleep due to the loud guests.  The manager kept saying how the night staff told him it did not go on as long as the man stated it did.   I wasn't going to bother saying anything to the hotel about the issues but I didn't appreciate how the manager who wasn't there that night was treating the man so my friend and I told the manager that we had the same experience and how it did go on for long despite what his night staff may have told him.   He assured us he would call up to us but he didn't.  I told the nice receptionist at checkout about our unpleasant stay at the hands of the neighbouring room.  
Overall would avoid this hotel again due to how poorly the issue was managed.",2,2023,01,15
249,Dirty room and mediocre food,"I stayed here with my father and the experience as a whole was disappointing. The reception as you walk in was  breathtaking. The staff at the reception were also very respectable. However, our room was very below bar. Flies in the room, stains on the carpet, it is clear that the hotel are cutting costs wherever and whenever. The hallway was dirty with food left outside people’s rooms waiting to be collected. The prices in the restaurant are way too over priced for what you are getting. Overall, I would not stay here again.",2,2023,01,14
249,We won’t return very pricey rooms are tired,"Entrance to the hotel was fabulous matched what we were expecting for the price we paid. Location right beside Liffey valley was ideal!
Bedroom and bathroom did not align with the price we paid. The bathroom was not clean and bad mould in it. Bedrooms were tired looking. Breakfast was ok nothing special in fact the fry was dry!",3,2022,12,30
249,Avoid,"After arriving near midnight on Sunday, a staff member who worked at the reception area was attacked by a male. My young son was petrified. The attacker arrived again the next morning causing carnage around the car park whilst staff looked on (again my son was witness to this) and not once did any staff member call the Garda - clearly this was a personal issue as they were all familiar with each-other . Not a great advertisement for Dublin or the hotel. AVOID",1,2022,12,20
249,Filth,"Due to car trouble yesterday I required a hotel in Dublin. After looking at various options I decided to go with the Clayton hotel Liffey valley for three reasons:1 I’d stayed there before a number of years ago and it was lovely , 2 it’s part of the Clayton group and 3 the pictures on booking.com
I paid €159 for room o ly.
We arrived and checked in and were greater warmly by a lovely girl on reception. Unfortunately that was the only positive of our visit.
We followed the directions given and stepped out of the somewhat shabby lift where things only got worse. The carpets were filthy and strewn with litter, the smell of sewage or drains was cloying and the nasty air freshener sprayed liberally smelt almost as bad as the odour it was trying to conceal.
However we decided to give it a chance even though first impressions were to get straight out of there!
We checked into our room which looked NOTHING like the pictures of the room I booked on booking.com but we could live with that. We dropped out bags and went out to eat. When we came back the smell of drains/sewage was in reception at this stage and it was gag inducing. No one made mention of it and just acted like it wasn’t there.
Back to the room we went dodging litter en route.
The carpet in the room was so dirty I wouldn’t take my shoes off until I was on the bed. To note there was no mattress protector or anything just the mattress and one sheet. 
My son pulled back his duvet to find some sort of sticky substance on the sheets… I told him it was chewing gum. 
Went to the phone to call reception and surprise surprise the phone was disconnected and the buttons removed….
Down to reception and told the receptionist the phone wasn’t working and that the sheets on my sons bed had something sticky on them and her reply was “ and you want…..?” 
Clean sheets if it’s not too much bother!!
I was told someone from housekeeping would be up straight away.
35 minutes later and still no one had appeared so back down to reception where I spoke to the front office manager.
I told him about the room, the bed, the dirt etc and he offered to change my room but at that  point I wasn’t willing to risk it. 
I checked out at 10pm and had to get a taxi to another hotel.
Here we are lunchtime the next day and NO ONE from the hotel has even bothered to get in touch.
Such a shame to see what was once a lovely chain of hotels reduced to this. It claims to be a 4 star. I wouldn’t give it 1.",1,2022,12,20
249,Fantastic staff and hotel,"My flight was cancelled by Aer Lingus and I was given a room at the Clayton Hotel. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The staff were so helpful and I would especially like to thank Patrick on Reception, who helped me book a ferry, train and taxi at 4.30 in the morning! Patrick went above and beyond to help me and is a credit to the hotel. I intend  to come back to Dublin again for a longer period of time and will definitely use this hotel again. Thank you Patrick for making a very stressful incident with the airline into an adventure by ferry and train!",5,2022,12,12
249,stay here 2022,"your bar staff are a credit to you. i wish i could think of our 2 servers names, they were so kind, professional, friendly and really helpful. your reception staff on the other hand…. 
myself and my husband decided to stay here for our 2 year anniversary to get some christmas shopping done for the children. upon arrival my husband was asked for ID?? when he asked why she said she needed to ensure he was over 18… that must be a joke!
She was very rude and unhelpful when my husband asked her directions, i would completely understand if she didn’t know where certain places were but she stopped and looked at him as if he should know (we are not local) 
I wish i could think of her name, blonde with lash expentions and lip filters !
the room was spacious. bar was lovely with a beautiful tree upon arrival. if only our stay upon arrival could have started well from the very beginning with more pleasant staff !!
TIP!! find somewhere better to stay",2,2022,12,04
249,Disgusting,"Came here with a Christmas group for shopping, the entrance would fool you as it looks nice, the room are the most disgusting filthy room I ever have come across in my travelling years the corridors full of rubbish haven't been hoovered , the dinner was the most basic I've come across no mash just hard roast potatoes l, wouldn't come back if I got for free avoid at all costs",1,2022,12,04
249,"My sister in law and myself stayed here last night 25/11/2022,to say it was disgraceful is an understatement,Clayton Sta","Disgusting hotel,we were on the second floor,the corridor was filthy and littered with kids toys,the smell was revolting,the window handle was broken,curtains hanging off,freezing cold,no drinking water,two chairs in the room were also filthy",1,2022,11,26
249,Bargain price of €317.55 for 1 night or 19 hours,"So disappointed with hotel on this occasion ,have stayed numerous times before and after covid ,but this was my last .Check in has now changed to 4 pm with check out at 11 am —giving us 19 hours in a hotel for the bargain price of €317.55 - based on 2 adults 1 child on B&B basis ( included was a €50 vcr for Liffey valley ) .

Got to the hotel early unfortunately and we weren’t able to check in - manager on duty was very busy - think he walked by us 4 times with a cake ; but rather than walking around with a bloody cake I’m sure there is other departments he could be helping out in , if things are stretched 
rather than trying to look busy carrying a cake and going nowhere.

We ended up going to the pool to kill some time , this was busy with kids swimming lessons , so we were all in the pool in a small square area  like sardines - members not impressed when you tried to do laps - changing rooms were disgusting-rubbish on the ground , staff at the gym /pool reception barely grunted when we were checking in

When eventually we were able to check in corridors were littered ,grubby ,smoky ,in serious need of new carpets ,paint work , 2 new lifts ( 2 were broken) and a complete overhaul .Got to our room where initially we were delighted at 2 rooms - 1 with a double bed , the 2nd room had a converted double sofa bed with springs sticking up in the middle and sharp metal edges on all 4 corners and then a fold up single bed …. Surely a double bed would be easier for staff to manage ,and much more comfortable for guests .

We headed out at 410 - as we had an appointment at 5pm and returned for dinner at 730 to the only bar /restaurant in hotel . Staff were lovely here once you got their attention and nothing seemed to be a bother - we ordered nasi goreng (lovely ), side portion of Thai green curry ( which I can guarantee you was mushroom soup )  ,chilli beef salad (very tough) and chicken goujons (lovely ) 

Breakfast was pandemonium , place was crazy but staff very efficient and friendly -can’t fault them

All in all very very  very disappointed with this hotel",1,2022,11,22
249,Miss,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend with my family, the hotel is lovely, everything went so smoothly the staff all over the whole hotel are super helpful, especially receptionists. Would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2022,11,22
249,Very enjoyable stay ,"Stayed here on a business trip, nice clean hotel, check in and out was very quick and easy, lovely reception staff. Good in the bar was nice, went for breakfast the next morning, great buffet, waiter was kind and polite.  ",5,2022,11,13
249,Lovely Hotel!,"We stayed over the weekend and I must say, we thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay. We were met at reception by warm, welcoming staff. We were lucky to get an early check-in, thanks to Lyndsey and Shyanne! The room was spacious and clean. The pool was lovely, again the staff was really helpful, unfortunately, we didn't get anyone's name! Big thanks again to all at the Clayton hotel for our lovely weekend away!",5,2022,11,13
249,Rachel Clair ,Rachel Clair on reception at night is a godsend to the company she is so helpful and very welcoming always greates me with a smile and is always willing to go that extra mile to make my stay more enjoyable ,5,2022,11,12

249,An inconvenience turned around!,"Michael (Hotel Mngr.) and Dumou turned our inconvenient situation into a memorable stay!
Dublin center hotels were unavailable so we were (unknowingly) sent a bit to the outskirts of the town! These two kind, efficient and friendly folk made our stay more than worth the while! Lovely room, wonderful breakfast!!! Thank you!",5,2022,11,11
249,Worst hotel experience I've ever had,"The hotel took payment from my card twice I spoke to the receptionist who was only short of saying I was lying even though I had proof on my online banking. I then spoke to a manager who told me I'd have to wait to speak to an evening manager. He wasn't available every time I called I eventually got my money back, but it was over €500 and it caused me a lot of stress the hotel just didn't care and I was made to feel like a nuance for politly asking for my own money which was taken without my consent. Awful service",1,2022,11,06
249,Stay somewhere else,"Hotel messed up our booking and instead of having two adjoining family rooms they put us in an apartment that hadn’t been cleaned.    They put in three camp beds for the children. We were booked in for two nights and the following morning I start getting emails about checking out by 11am, with no indication of when the family rooms would be ready. The food is poor quality. Scrambled egg is rubbery and the “best ever curry” is maybe one of the worst I’ve tasted. Overall not a good experience. I wish I had stayed anywhere else. Overpriced for the service and quality on offer",1,2022,11,02
249,Definitely not 4 star,Stayed here for 1 night on 24 September. We booked a deluxe family room. We got a supposedly deluxe standard room. No apology! Pool was unavailable. That was disappointing.Corridors were littered with peoples cutlery and bags of rubbish. There were gangs of kids running up and down the corridors.  Its basically a huge homeless hostel. Certainly not a 4 star stay. For €245 We expected a bit more than what We got.  When I raised My issues I was just fobbed off by the Manager. Very poor!,1,2022,11,01
249,Average,"Rooms are clean, but dated. The hotel Gym is very good & the best you’ll ever likely get with a hotel. 
Always a lovely warm welcome from the reception team, especially Jasmine,  attentive & very in tune to new customers; assisting me with the local area amenities, not to forget excellent communication & friendly professional & social skills second to none. 5* staff 3* hotel….",3,2022,10,23
249,best reception team,"checking in was done easy and quick & the girls on reception girls couldn’t of been any nicer especially jasmine who checked me in. Jasmine is a credit to they Clayton and made me feel right at home as soon as I arrived, she made sure the check in was quick and easy and I had all my needs met, will definitely be back!!",5,2022,10,23
249,Very Poor,"My word , from the second we entered the reception and were greeted by the young girl Jasmine  who couldn’t and never once made eye connection with me while she was checking us in.I doubt if I have ever come across anyone as rude in a hotel environment. 
Pool was closed , rooms were only just acceptable. Place overall seems to be on a slippery slope in my view. Hallways are grubby and need to be updated. We have stayed here a few times previously and never had any issues but this time , I haven’t anything much positive to say about it. Needless to say we won’t be returning .",2,2022,10,21
249,Great family place easy access,We arrived late and after a quick check in we entered into a lovely Family room which was huge! The kids and us had a great night’s sleep and we woke up to have a great breakfast buffet! Warm choices and yummy continental choices. Thanks again and we’ll be back!,5,2022,10,06
249,Two days in Dublin,"A splendid hotel for our stay of 2 nights. A comfortable room, excellent facilities and with particular praise for Libby and Oumou on reception for whom nothing was too much trouble.  We left the car at the hotel and went into Dublin on the ""C"" series buses. Much easier than tackling Dublin's traffic and parking headaches. €2.60 per person (coin only)",5,2022,10,05

Only for tayto park being a great day out I would have being upset athis place ifelt sick leaving this hotel iwasso tired from lack of sleep and the smell lof smoke.dont waste your hard earned money on this pit.",1,2022,09,17
249,Got upgraded!! Wish I didn’t!,"After a long day, we arrived at the hotel, reception lovely. Checked in around 10pm, reception told us we had been upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite in a separate building, and that it was newly refurbished and really lovely. We were excited about the upgrade, but the lifts were shoddy and buttons broken covered in tape, hallways dirty and the room, god, 2 bedroom suite, no double bed, only singles, which we pushed together since we were there as a couple. Mattresses old and could feel the springs. The carpet was filthy with stains. Furniture very old with marks all over them and stains. Tiles on floor leading out to the balcony we’re all broken and chipped, dangerous in bare feet as sharp. Nail polish or paint on the bedside lockers. Drawers broken in desk. Stains in toilet. Stains and marks on walls. Bust plaster on walls. Tried phone reception on both phones that were in the room but neither worked. Our mates had been staying in main hotel building and got original room we had booked, standard double and they said it was lovely so it was disappointing to be awarded an ‘upgrade’ for €165 that wasn’t work €80 a night. Please don’t tell guests they are been upgraded to a really lovely newly refurbished suite to be met with what I was.",1,2022,09,04
249,Just what it says on the tin,"Here you get everything that you paid for. Rooms are clean comfortable and have al the requirements for a comfortable stay.
Leisure center is great- pool is big and the sauna, steam and jacuzzi are the best i have seen anywhere.
Food is good but we did have a long wait for a dinner we had booked. Staff are friendly and helpful .",4,2022,08,29
249,AVOID,"All covered in previous reviews, but for what it’s worth…

Positives: spacious rooms, use of pool (which seemed fine on our visit despite what other reviewers have said - nb they provide towels), parking - we had top box on car, couldn’t go in underground car park, & they let us park in front of the hotel with no problems, sheets/towels seemed clean (again despite other reviews). 

Negatives: *wildly* over-priced restaurant (I mean really - the food is average at best yet costs an arm and a leg. Much better to head for the shopping centre 10 mins walk away with Zizzi etc); but ABOVE ALL it was SO DAMN NOISY. Which after all is the main point of a hotel - to get some sleep. The main issue, as cited by other reviewers, were gangs of kids roaming the corridors shouting, swearing, singing and banging doors until - I kid you not - 3.30am (this was before a 6am wake up - fun times). Zero consideration for other guests. Our best guess is it’s parents getting trolleyed in the bar and letting their offspring roam free. The motorway on one side and noisy car park on the other doesn’t help either. 

Never ever again!",1,2022,08,28
249,Expensive example of how not to provide a hotel service,"Under staffed, over booked and unorganised.  Booked and pre paid over a month in advance, also requested a baby cot upon booking. Arrived in room to no cot.... Requested a cot ..nothing was in room when we returned at 8:30pm to put baby to sleep. Requested again with nothing. Over hour later received a phone call which woke baby up to say they had no cots. Spent 100 EUR at dinner in a hectic over booked resturant to be over charged for two deserts we didn't receive and told they could not refund because we had already paid.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Hospitality business that can't refund without ""writing a letter"" to their accounts team, comical when I think about it 🤣🤣..... Interesting stay! 350euro.... One night, no cot!  absolutely unacceptable in my opinion.",2,2022,08,20
249,Rooms are very hot. Pool is filthy. ,This hotel does NOT HAVE AIR CON. Spending 2 nights here 15/16 Aug. The room is like an oven. There is a single tower fan that only works on one setting. The one window in our room opens out onto the N4 motorway. So choose between cooking and suffocating in your room or constant noise from thousands of vehicles. We resorted to filling the bath with cold water to put our feet in to cool off. You can imagine what this is like with two young children. We went to the pool and it is really quite filthy. You can barely see the bottom because of the dirt in the water. The floors in the changing rooms are revolting. Used disposable razors and band aids lying in the showers. The hotel spa / health club is open to the public and is right next to a housing estate so it not just guests using the facilities here. This is not a 4 star hotel. It's 3 at best. £370 for 2 nights room only is extortionate. I would not recommend this hotel. In fact I will actively discourage people from using this hotel. The travel desk in the firm I work for will also be told to remove this hotel from any possible business use. I would be embarrassed to send members of my staff here. ,1,2022,08,15
249,Room so hot.... ,Had to book this last minute for a family funeral. Was really caught for options as was so late booking. This was still not cheap by any matter or means.. Check in was straight forward....  Lots of families kids etc... We were on the third floor.. Oh my god the heat in the room.... We had window open and there was a noisy fan that we plugged in.. Can't describe how stifling and uncomfortable the room was.. We didn't eat in the hotel due to the additional cost and how busy it was.  Location is good for liffey Valley and ikea and to get on m50.  ,3,2022,08,15
249,Hostel experience at 4* prices,"I stayed her with my son for 1 night.

I couldn't say there was anything that stood out as exceptionally bad but this is no 4* Hotel.

The hotel in generally is very shabby. Lumps of plaster missing from walls which are filthy and in bad need of painting. 
The room was uncomfortably hot and the window couldn't be left open due to traffic noise outside.
I'd hate to see how warm these rooms are in hot weather.
Seems to be a lot of people living here rather than being guests.
There was plenty of noise during the night which include a group shouting outside our door @ 4:30am.

Breakfast was average at best.

249,Won’t visit again !,"Had a meal in the restaurant, couldn’t cater for my granddaughters dairy allergy . Ended up going to Starbucks for food for her . Under cooked chips . Served unopened muscles . Strawberries rotting in the fridge from previous guest . Rooms. Not cleaned had to ask for toilet rolls and towels . Dirty glasses left in reception . I took a tray full back to the bar . Spoke to the general manager who did go and buy dairy free spread for my granddaughter and they ordered in dairy free ice cream . After the experience in the restaurant we didn’t eat an evening meal at the hotel again .  Swimming pool heaving , turned away loads of people wanting to swim . Never seen so many people come into a hotel with takeaway food . Breakfast was good .",1,2022,08,01
249,Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley,"So so bad. No room service. I went to the bar for a glass of milk for a babies bottle and I was told there was no milk!!! I went to reception to complain and I got it no problem. Breakfast was so bad. No room in the restaurant was put in the bar which was very unsuitable. Fresh fruit, pastries left on a table not cover people standing over the food. Extremely unhygienic. Yea and coffee was self service which was cold. Extremely unsatisfactory for €190 B&B. The hotel badly needs to be redecorated.",1,2022,07,30
249,Avoid like the plague ,"Absolutely filthy.

Having stayed several times over the last ten years we were looking forward to a little family trip for our son's birthday. Having booked a family suite we arrived to a broken fridge, filthy toilet and zero utensils or cutlery. 

We asked for someone to look at the fridge and we got someone up to tell us it was fine. The fridge was literally warm. We then asked for utensils and were asked what we needed them for? I said I needed to make breakfast for the kids and couldn't make it without utensils. I was told to call reception again to request them. Upon doing so we were provided with some spoons and bowls and plates....no knives, forks or glasses.

Next up, the toilet. You wouldn't see the filth in a hostel. It was the most disgusting toilet. Looks like it hadn't been scrubbed in years. We asked for it to be cleaned again and they still couldn't get the dirt off. 

My husband went to complain again about the fridge and we were given complimentary breakfast for the following morning and they eventually sorted the fridge. When looking in the cupboard he found leftover raisins... clearly the cupboards hasn't been cleaned. 

In general the rooms needs total renovation as they are completely run down and dirty. No questions from staff when we asked to check out early. Clearly management have given up here as this hotel has gone way downhill and does not deserve a 4 star rating. It was the worst hotel experience in a long time. 

Also the rule about not letting kids in the pool before 9 is a bit mad considering there is a kids pool.. A very disappointing stay. ",1,2022,07,24
249,Do NOT stay here.,The place is a dump. Do NOT let Aer Lingus put you there. No air conditioning and carpet was duck taped together in places. Do not be fooled by the check in area. We were told by Aer Lingus that this is a 4 star hotel in the Dublin city center. Both were lies. A complete dump makes a Motel 6 look upscale.,1,2022,07,22
249,ok for a brief overnight stay,"Had a bad experience here this morning, I had my laptop powered on in bedroom and went for breakfast leaving laptop on bedroom desk along with my wallet, car keys, wedding ring, bags etc. My bedroom was beside lift and I was surprised when I found my bedroom door open when I stepped from lift. I expected cleaners were inside but there was nobody, walked down the corridor and could not find anyone. So the cleaners went into a occupied bedroom with all my belongings, propped the door open by turning the bedroom lock into locked position while door was open, and then walked away. I was checking out that morning so I cannot understand why the cleaners did not simply close the door when they seen belongings still in room. There is no logic to why this happened as cleaners do not clean rooms on day of checkout until the guest has left and all this happened around 10am in morning 2 hours before checkout time.
The cleaners were also making allot of noise from early morning and talking loudly outside bedroom door as if nobody was still in bed.

There is no air-conditioning in hotel bedrooms so it was extremely hot and stuffy due to current hot weather. The mattress and duvet were good quality though and overall the bedroom was clean and bed was comfortable and shower was good.

Parking is also included and carpark is secure underground with roller shutters that close.  Can't complain about breakfast either.

The layout of the hotel is confusing to get around as the numbering system is very odd, for example room 430 is on the 2nd floor and room 200 is on ground floor.",2,2022,07,22
249,Don’t bother,"What a disappointing room. Checked into this hotel for a week due to a work visit. 4* a joke. Room dirty, food bland and staff rude. Arrived and room not ready. Left luggage and checked in later after travelling from London and a day at work to an okay room but very dirty linen. 1st evening meal very average and staff no better ! After eventually seeing sense spoke to Sean who in previous reviews saved the day - spoke to regarding  issues experienced to date.  Smelt the dirty sheets and offered no resolution other than Free breakfast. This wasn’t an option due to work commitments but couldn’t offer an alternative. Didn’t at all feel  valued as a customer. . Food , room and service poor - not at all 4*. Wouldn’t recommend or stay agin.",1,2022,07,06
249,A return stay to a convenient and handy hotel located on the edge of Dublin,"We've stayed at the Clayton Liffey Valley a few times before over the last ten years or so we've lived in Westport, and needed a place to stay in the Dublin area.

We had a standard triple/family room which was spacious and more than adequate for our needs. Everything worked (apart from the TV where half of the Freeview channels didn't work and there was no Netflix option which would have been handy) , and it was all very clean. However the room was a little battered and worn around the edges, but it was all okay for the purposes of our short break. It was nice to have a mini-fridge and a full size bath which was handy for washing our young children in.

We had asked at the time of booking for a room on a higher floor and with a balcony as these had been recommended to us. I had checked-in automatically online, and I regret doing this as I wasn't able to reconfirm with reception whether they had such a room available (which obviously they didn't) as the hotel was quite full.

Some of the carpeting and walls along the hotel corridors seemed worn and well-worked, but it was all quite clean. The downstairs foyer area was very nice, but generally the hotel could do with a repaint and refurbishment as I believe it's been open since 2004.

The staff were excellent, and handled a stressful situation with one of my additional needs daughters in a very professional and calm manner. Our server at dinner confided in me that she had similar life challenges (sorry I never caught her name!)

The food was very good quality and tasty, with plenty of choices for breakfast and plenty of it. I recommend the made to order porridge which comes with a choice of different flavours with berries and nuts as you prefer. Very tasty! The restaurant menu for dinner was excellent, and we used the room service facility via the Clayton Hotel phone app one evening which was very handy,

All in all, a great stay at this friendly and convenient hotel. It just needs a lick of paint in places...then it'll be grand!",4,2022,06,28
249,"Dirty, needs renovation or a very good clean","The towels and sheets were clean. What more can I say? Amazed that anyone has rated this place as a decent place to stay. The carpet was stained, the bathroom tiles were dirty, there was a huge damp stain on the ceiling, and specks of blood on the curtain. The breakfast was ok, but pretty standard for a below average hotel. How they can charge what they do is beyond me. 4 star hotel it is not. It barely scrapes a 3 in my book. 

Basically, yuck. Don't book here.",2,2022,06,23
249,Worst hotel experience ever,"My husband rang the hotel several days in advance of arrival to ensure we had an easy access room as I am disabled with extremely limited walking ability.  
We arrived to basically be told our room was out of reach for me.
When my husband explained they changed the room but still a long distance away which meant I needed my wheelchair, something we’d planned to avoid.
The hotel does not have automatic doors to the corridors  so every time we had to go through the doors my husband struggled bashing me each time as there was no help available.  We observed staff watching but no help.  The whole reason we needed a close room was because I have a serious neck injury and every bash against and unsuitable heavy door is extremely painful.

That evening we saw a group of people eating in the dining room so asked for a table.  We were told by staff we were not allowed to eat there as it was for your groups only.  It was nearly empty!  It’s normal to eat in a restaurant when you stay in a hotel but not this hotel.  We were told we could eat at the bar which is not what we wanted.

The room we stayed in was very basic.  My husband told the receptionist in the morning that we had difficulty sleeping as the room was very hot only to be told that “Irish hotels don’t have air conditioning “.  That really did feel like the most pathetic response.

At breakfast sitting in my wheelchair I had to remove a chair from the table in my own as my husband got us food.  You can imagine as a wheelchair user with a neck injury this was some feat.

I will say the staff at reception didn’t smile at us once, didn’t got out of their way to help.  I did as what I thought was a manager to open the door for me on one occasion and he did pleasantly.  I can honestly say that was the only positive experience of our stay.  Going away for a night is a massive physical ordeal for me and I felt this really couldn’t have been made harder.

On our way home I described the experience to my husband as “rent a room with robots at reception “.  It certainly did not even remotely feel like a hotel.
I felt strongly discriminated against as a disabled person.

I don’t believe the staff even noticed I was disabled.  

All in all a horrible experience.   One definitely not to be repeated.",1,2022,06,13
249,Keycard didn’t work and had to ask for room to be cleaned,"Everything was amazing the food was GREAT but there’s 2 very annoying things,if your a walker and you want to get fit or your room is close but for us it wasn’t like that- the keycard wouldn’t work you had to walk down to the desk to get it work. If you don’t have the time to go down to the front desk and ask for your room to be cleaned this is not the hotel for you we put up the sign for our room to be cleaned when we were out in Dublin and it’s not like they didn’t see it I seen them walking up and down the hall.",3,2022,06,12
249,Still waiting for a call back from the duty manager.,"We were booked for a two night stay. We were out all day on our first day and returned after 7pm to an uncleaned room. I called reception to inquire as to why our room had not been cleaned, to be told that I had to request a room clean. This was not explained to us during the check in process and not mentioned in the documentation received during the check-in. I escalated the issue to the duty manager with no satisfaction. All he wanted to offer was for a cleaner to come to the room at that stage of the evening. I was travelling with a toddler and it was his bed time so it was not suitable for a cleaner to come in. Plus having a stranger come in would of unsettled my toddler so close to bed time. The duty manager never asked if we needed towels, toilet roll etc. The duty manager’s handling of my issue was very disappointing.

Upon check out I raised the issue again and the receptionist took my details and advised another duty manager would call me. Its now 36 hrs since I checked out and no one bothered to contact me. Very poor customer service.",2,2022,06,09
249,Avoid,"To be charged through the nose for a dirty room with broken facilities, inadequate cleaning, a broken safe, alarms going all night, staff who don't care and a frankly dangerous car park exit is not acceptable.

Avoid at all costs",1,2022,06,07
249,No milk at a 4 star hotel 🤣 good job guys 👏 ,"Been woke up at 4AM by people and the guards screaming outside the entrance of the hotel. My sick boyfriend needed milk and rang reception to be told they "" don't do that"" you don't have milk at a 4 star hotel. Absolute JOKE of a hotel. Won't be back.",1,2022,06,05
249,The food is just delicious!,"We have a 6 night stay due to work. Usually we would eat in a hotel for a couple of nights then go further a field on long tours - not at this hotel!
The variety of dishes, presentation, taste and portion sizes are just fabulous! 
Nearly didn’t get in tonight as we hadn’t booked a table! Booking one for tomorrow right now! 
Lavinia, Ina and Brandon are a credit to the company!!!",5,2022,06,05
249,Expensive out of city stay,"Reception staff were excellent on arrival ( sorry I didn't get the young ladies name) she was certainly an asset to the hotel.  The other half loved the Leisure facilities and was pleasantly surprised by what was on offer. Unfortunately, we had "" someone"" hammering on our Bedroom door just after 5. 30 am looking for their mobile phone!!! Needless to say this was quite scary and had I been a ""lone"" Female guest it would have been very frightening!!!. We had been so looking forward to a peaceful night's sleep as we had just arrived from an overnight flight from Toronto and had little or no sleep. When I mentioned the issue to the receptionist the following morning her only response was ""oh I think I know who that was and they are not staying tonight"" no apology, offer of a coffee/ drink in the bar etc etc. The walls in the room appeared to be paper thin and the conversations were clearly audible and guests seemed to be checking out/ banging doors etc at all hours of the night, in hindsight  sleeping in the car would possibly have been more comfortable.",3,2022,05,29
249,Looks lovely but leaves a lot to be desired,"I stayed here 22/5/22 with my newborn & my sister in a family room number 262. My sister had booked the cot when she booked online & rang to make sure it’d be there. Got to the room it wasn’t there! It arrived about an hour later. There was no shower gel in the bathroom again had to ring & have it sent up. No toiletries of any kind in the bathroom but maybe the don’t provide them as a rule? There was black mould in the bathroom in the grout around the bath and soap holder but with no fan in the bathroom what would you expect? Realised the heating wasn’t working at about 10.30 despite turning on the radiator, I didn’t ring reception as my baby was asleep. The coffee sachets were so old the branding was fading off them. I’m all for not wasting things but at the tail end of a pandemic maybe step up the hygiene game a bit? We got the impression the room isn’t used much. 

On the corridor where the room was there was shop bought food containers outside one room & glasses outside another. These were there until just before we checked out the following morning. The door to the right of the reception desk to the rooms is supposed to be key access only, it was not. The food & restaurant staff were lovely as were the breakfast & breakfast staff, we were served by Onosen who was extremely friendly.",1,2022,05,27
249,The hotel was okay but very expensive,"Stayed here for 2 nights recently, I was amazed at the high  prices, I believe this is the same everywhere now in or around Dublin, the breakfast was from memory 17.95 euro ouch 🤕 beer was 7.60 a pint. The room was clean with a nice view of the main road slightly obscured by trees. On a positive note the staff were very friendly for this reason I gave the hotel 4 stars 
Would I return?
Probably not",4,2022,05,26
249,"Loud, unkept and dirty","While the staff that work here are friendly, the hotel is in a poor state of repair!  The room was dirty, children run up and down the hallway half the night, and the adults were just as bad as the kids, but a little more alcohol fuelled!  I’m in favour of people having a good time and enjoying themselves, but it shouldn’t be at the expense of others that are not staying for that purpose! I basically didn’t sleep while I was here.  

General maintenance is not good, some public areas and the bedrooms are not in good condition and housekeeping must be just checking some boxes and not checking out the room!  

I did send some pictures to Clayton Hotels but never had a reply, so I thought I’d share as a buyer beware! 

If the property wants to keep their head in the sand and pretend there are no problems, their choice but the guests should know what they are really getting",1,2022,05,21
249,Brilliant as always,"I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions and each time i have had no major complaints with this hotel.  A couple of minor ones not even worth mentioning.  

The staff here are excellent and on the last number of stays there is an Assistant Front office manger I cant think of his name, he is excellent and an asset to the hotel.  
The food in the bar was very good and the service was very good not problems at all.  Yes when the bar was but you may have to wait to be served but this is the same as any busy place.
The rooms are spotless only thing pillows are to soft but again a minor thing I am sure if I had asked for more I would have got them.

Breakfast good selection on offer and good service.
This is a good hotel in a good location that is why we keep returning.",4,2022,05,17
249,Friendly and helpful just missing them little bits 👍,"Good hotel for a good location. Reception and staff very helpful and friendly. Wonderful use of on site swimming pool, bit strange that we all had to buy and ware swimming hats! My wife and I travelled with a little one, I was surprised that no drinking chocolate in room neither at reception or the bar which was a bit disappointing. They did not seem to have much as we asked for some toothpaste as we forgot to pack ours which they did not have either strange for a 5 star hotel. You had to book your room to be cleaned and book breakfast which we found a bit odd as we already booked breakfast and thought the room would be cleaned as usual. We had a room with a balcony which was lovely to end the night with, with a glass wine.

The morning breakfast was lovely, very friendly welcome. Much to chose from, cooked breakfast, cereal, fruit, lovely fresh  juices and fresh coffee which was a bit strong, it was good to see they even had oat milk which was a big thumbs up.

Like I mentioned the location was good. It was about a 15min walk to the new liffey valley shopping center which was fully of restaurants, cinema and shops, you can also get the C3 bus which is a 15min trip into Dublin center, make sure you have a bus pass or the correct change for the bus as they do not except debit payment on the bus.

Overall nice place to stay for a weekend.",4,2022,05,14
249,"Very disappointing, low standards, very loud.","I arrived at 6pm I had checked in online and I picked up the room key. The reception area was so busy and loud that I had to lip read what the receptionist was saying. Even at that time there was a loud group from a party also outside the hotel on the side of the bar. 

We had reservations in liffey valley to eat and go to the cinema so I just collected the key card and we didn't return to the room until after 10pm. 

When we got to the room, despite the booking clearly being for 2 adults 3 children there was no beds set up for the children and no bedding in the room. There was no answer when we rang reception and my husband had to go to find staff. When they arrived they had 2 sheets and 2 pillow covers. No pillows or duvets. And the pull out sofa bed was not suitable for 2 children and still left us with one child without a bed. 

The noise levels around the hotel throughout the night was awful we were not too near the ground floor but it still sounded like there was a party outside our window, closing the window did not help. 

The last time we stayed we had similar problems but because of location and our plans, I said we'd give the Clayton liffey valley another chance. 
It was very disappointing to see not only had things not got any better but had actually got worse. 
We took the stairs instead of the lift to breakfast and it looked like they hadn't been hoovered in a long time. There was only one bin in the whole suite in the bathroom I'm sure this is to speed up the cleaning of rooms but it wasn't very helpful to us. 

Very disappointed, this was a trip for a special occasion and it really knocked a lot of good out of the weekend. 
Breakfast was standard.",1,2022,05,11
249,"Fantastic hotel, great value for money. Would highly recommend.","A lovely hotel. Great value for money. Very clean and rooms are a great size. Staff can't do enough for you .specially Michael on front desk .Overall, a great stay, and a great hotel.. Would definitely recommend!",5,2022,05,03
249,Fantastic,"Loved this hotel!
Customer service was fantastic - in particular Lyndsey, Ciara and Tara were great and so good with the children. But in all honesty, all members of staff I met were lovely and very happy to do anything we needed. 
Check in and check out were both quick and easy. Very little queueing for breakfast or service in bar. 
We ate one evening meal in the hotel and it was nice. Breakfast was fantastic both mornings. 
Both rooms in our booking were lovely - well appointed, fairly modern and very clean.
Pool was fantastic each of the 3 times we visited!
Secure car parking was very reasonable. 
We will definitely return as location was great for a family trip to Dublin attractions",5,2022,05,02
249,Disappointing,"I stayed in the Clayton with my family on Sat 23 and Sun 24 of April and was seriously disappointed.

The hotel room was basic to say the least. Small uncomfortable pillows; only 2 large towels and no small towels (there were three of us ) and no teaspoons with the tea/coffee making facilities. We were told our room wouldn't be serviced during our stay so the tea/coffee and milk never got replenished. Also, the room was uncomfortably hot, even with the window wide open.

The corridor outside our room was filthy and smelly. Dirty laundry bags, dirty towels thrown on the ground and rubbish everywhere. I've attached photos which were taken at 7 in the evening. The photos don't even show how dirty it really was.

As for the bar. On the first night my husband ordered a pint of Smithwicks. The girl behind the bar started pouring from the wrong tap. When my husband told her she went to the right tap and proceeded to fill his pint ON TOP of the one she had started pouring previously.

On the second night he ordered me a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and the barman had to ask him if it was red or white wine!!

I know a manager will reply to this email with the usual platitude of 'I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your stay but we are short staffed at the moment'. However, if staffing is an issue, the hotel should only be filling the amount of rooms they are able to cope with, both from a cleaning and service perspective.

We have used this hotel a lot in the past but never again. It was a total waste of money and I would urge people to look elsewhere when planning a trip to Dublin.",1,2022,04,26
249,Proximity to airport,"This was  our first stay here and picked for the proximity to the airport and price.
I specifically requested an upper floor room but when we checked in we were located on the ground floor next to a busy car park. A quick call to reception and we were moved to the 4th floor. This was a much bigger room which had a little  Kitchenette and two bedrooms. Unfortunately these rooms are very dated and worn around the edges & in need of alot of tlc. However as it was only a one night stay this didn’t overly bother us. The bed was comfortable and plenty hot water which was the main thing. Dinner in the main bar was a little on the pricey side but good service and food was fine.",3,2022,04,26
249,Great stay,"Can’t recommend this hotel enough really enjoyed my stay Michael from the front desk was so welcoming nothing was an issue he went over and beyond to make sure the stay at the hotel was nothing less than prefect the room was also great .. can’t wait to come back 

Thanks again",5,2022,04,24
249,"Rude, inefficient and a waste of time",This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. They insist on a check in time no earlier than 4pm which means the world and his wife show up then and the queues take hours. No apologies offered whatsoever and rude staff who try to justify this inefficiency with lies about how this happens in all hotels. They also have no means of offering feedback so clearly don’t value their customers opinions and have no desire to improve the dire level of service they provide.,1,2022,04,23
249,Disappointing and won’t return,"I have rebooked this hotel many times so I checked in online and rang to ensure we wouldn’t endure the long q to get our cards for the room. Even still
It took about ten mins to get our cards as the receptionist decided to serve someone who skipped the queue and wasn’t very pleasant to them. Once we got to our room it was fine clean and of normal standard. We left the hotel to go to a show and on return we wanted to go into the bar but the hotel has attracted some clientele that decided to smear the baby changing toilet with number 2. That had to
Be locked to avoid anyone going in. Then security removed one person from
The bar area so we drank in the lobby. It just isn’t the same as it used to be. In order to avoid any issues at breakfast we went down early . We were told we could use the bar for breakfast. Beans were cold there was no fried eggs. It was all very univiting . On leaving breakfast there was a customer complaining to the
Manager about the noise on his corridor from
This crowd over night. We stayed on the third floor and omg the smell that night was horrific. When
I booked this night away I had always book for 5 nights on summer but have cancelled. This hotel has really changed. The crowd isn’t good and it’s sad to not be able to return. Very very disappointing but I absolutely would not recommend",1,2022,04,18
249,Wrong room bot enough beds,"We booked this hotel as we were visiting Dublin Zoo, for 3 adults and 2 children (my third child is over 12 and considered an adult )  when we arrived the room we booked the receptionist told us was for 3 adults,  luckily we had our confirmation of our booking which was for 5 people, she processed to tell us there were no family rooms available as it was late and we were from mayo my 9 year old and to sleep in the double bed with us.

It was €205 for 1 night not including breakfast and not to have enough beds really isn't good enough also its advertised as a 4 star its 2 at best all the small things that make your hotel stay comfortable have been taken away no biscuit with tea very little toiletries really no frills of any kind.

We found a slice cheese wrapper on one of the shelves and the bathroom was grubby,  also cleaning staff told us there was a shortage of towels,  there was 2 big towels for 5 people.

Really don't like giving bad reviews but I feel the turn around on rooms maybe too quick. I've left it at 3 stars because of location and kids enjoyed the pool.",3,2022,04,17
249,Work trip-April '22,"It was first time back here post pandemic and I must say it was great to be back in familiar surroundings, it would be nice to see the Gusto restaurant open again but I know we're still in uncertain times. Pool and gym facilities were top notch as always, even though it was quite busy with the kids on midterm there was still plenty of secure parking available, also loads of room in the bar/restaurant.
Lots of new faces to greet me but delighted to see Sharon in the restaurant for breakfast the next morning, she's an absolute credit to the establishment, always so friendly and helpful.
I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

249,AVOID,"AVOID! Unless you want broken beds, moths flying in your room and totally unresponsive staff. Also, incorrect invoicing on top of everything else. Substandard and not close to 4 star stay. Call for action for the local rating agency to review this hotel?",1,2022,04,13
249,Very nice stay,"Patrycja in the restaurant was fantastic and very helpful. Went above and beyond, we will definitely be returning to this hotel. Had a lovely one night stay with friends and family. Perfect location, lovely clean rooms, comfortable and welcoming environment.",4,2022,04,12

249,Great stay ,"A lovely hotel. Great value for money.  Very clean and rooms are a great size. Iron board, Iron, hairdryer, tea and coffee tray in the rooms. Shower is great and powerful. Lovely fluffy towels in the bathroom. Had food in the bar which was delicious and a great choice of dishes to have. Had breakfast which was very good, self service which is great (only a very little observation is there was no green tea bags at breakfast and I do love a green tea in the morning. I did ask for some and they had none 😢). The staff are so kind and professional at all times. I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay and we will definitely stay again 😁. ",5,2022,04,10
249,Grand …. Not 4*,It was ‘grand’ overall. Wouldn’t fancy more than one night although. Staff friendly enough. Hotel itself needs updating. It’s popular based on its location so probably gets away with more than others would. Main focal point for me was the price of the bar food - €45 for 2 dinners and 2 soft drinks. €20 for a dinner it would want to be better than a handful of chips and lukewarm fish. But I guess it’s the ‘new normal’ we now have to accept that the hospitality industry lost out during the lockdowns so like everything else the customer will be the one paying for it for a long time. Wouldn’t stay there again.,3,2022,04,05
249,"Disgusting, Derelict and Unforgiveable","Our stay at the Clayton Hotel at Liffey Valley, Ireland was one of the worst hotel experiences I've had. I've stayed in a lot of hotels when I travel and what we endured in this hotel was simply appalling and unforgivable, especially for the money we paid. 

What made this worse was that this was my girlfriend's first time in Europe, her first time leaving her country in Brazil. I was extremely embarrassed. I could have left, but I gave this ""hotel"" the benefit of the doubt. 

We had a lot of problems with the cleanliness and room service during our stay, some would say the basics of hotel management. 
When we arrived at the hotel, my girlfriend who had spent just under 24 hours to get to Ireland we quickly discovered we had no toiletries, towels or even the coffee and tea ""compliments"" in the room, simple small things such as no spoon. We even had to ask at a busy reception for toilet paper, because we didn't have that either.

An unusual request was that we had to ask at reception every day for the room to be cleaned and several times it hadn't been cleaned even after our complaints to reception. On our first 3 days out of 15 days the room hadn't been touched by a member of the cleaning staff. 
As you would, we complained to the hotel reception about the complete lack of cleaning for those days, after complaining to a supervisor at reception we managed to get them to give us ""clean"" bedding, but get this.. it was us who had to change the sheets and pillow cases. I have to say, I've never had to service my own hotel room before.

On several occasions in particular the pillows were absolutely disgusting. We were easily able to find blood stains on the pillows....disgusting! We went to reception to complain to the supervisor and honestly it felt that he was struggling to give us an apology, he certainly didn't give the impression that he cared at all, it was like he didn't want to apologize....

We received our ""clean"" pillow about 2 hours later (see attached). Notice the disgusting brown stains splattered throughout the pillow...

The bedroom curtains had also had large brown stains along with sections of the walls (more than likely coffee stains or tea...god knows)

The hairdryer in the room was non-functional, helpful for when my girlfriend had just washed her hair when showering.

The radiator was also broken in the room,  to combat the extreme levels of heat we had to leave the hotel room window open all night and throughout the day. To battle the hotter days we had to use a fan that we found in the room because the radiator could not be switched off. We reported the radiator to reception and they had advised us to use the non-existent knob to adjust the temperature...

On our final day of this filthy, disgusting excuse of a hotel, the breakfast price unexpectedly increased from 12 euros to 17 euros each!

We paid 1,350 euros for 15 days and this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and for what we paid it was absolute daylight robbery. After our long days exploring Ireland we return to a filthy, depressing, abandoned carpet stains in hallway to our room and I am not joking, every night the strongest smells of marijuana was in the air and it was going nowhere, we had the noise of people arguing, fighting and teenagers running up and down the corridors all night and into the early hours of the morning.

I can't rate this experience any lower, poor excuse for a hotel and I will be contacting Fáilte Ireland as they are clearly unaware of how atrocious the experience and quality is and also for the sheer embarrassment I had to endure when having my girlfriend visit... Not good enough!",1,2022,04,04
249,Family stay,Stayed here for one night to go to Tayto Park. This is no way a 4 star hotel more like a 2 star. The hotel is grubby and smelly with dark long corridors and poor signage. No facilities for children. The deluxe rooms are very sub standard with shower curtains over the bath and no water in the rooms. The hotel would need a complete refurb. Children seem to run the corridors  even late at night making noise and would appear to be people living in the hotel as several of the doors are sitting ajar all day. The breakfast is very average and the staff are not very friendly at all. We were also approached twice outside the hotel Door with beggars. We would never come back.,1,2022,04,03
249,Never seen such a shambles in my life,"Upon check in we were greeted by a nice girl who gave us information about the hotel and facilities. We booked a deluxe family room which was lovely but quite noisy due to the main road outside but I suppose that's not the hotels fault. We requested a cot for our baby when making our reservation but it wasn't in our room when we arrived. I had to ring reception to request it again and when we arrived back from exploring the surrounding area it was in our room. On our 1st  night we had an extremely noisy guest next door who got himself unbelievable drunk and was shouting and banging on his door to the extent he woke our 10 month old and 3 year old. My 3 year old had never heard anything like this and was understandably scared. I called reception who sent a duty manager and security guard up. His noise stopped for 20 mins (enough time to get my kids back asleep) when he started screaming and shouting again and woke my kids again. Once again I rang reception and they sent a security guard to his room and once again things went quiet for long enough to get the kids asleep again. This continued for 3 hours. Finally at 11.45pm I rang reception and asked the very nice lady to do something to sort this issue out. Rather than have the guest removed after numerous warnings they suggested we move rooms but offered us a family suite. This meant taking a 3 year old and 10 month old from their beds at 11.45pm and walking the corridors with them asleep in our arms. The receptionist told us all we had to do was take the kids and leave all our things and go to the new room which we did only to find their was no cot set up in the new room for our baby. I had to go to the old room myself and bring the cot to the other side of the hotel with no help. The next morning at breakfast we were greeted by the nicest lady called Sandra (duty manager) in the restaurant. We explained to her what had happened the previous night and she relayed this to the manager who asked us to speak to him after breakfast. He arranged an extra nights stay free of charge by way of apology which we really appreciated. Issue sorted. Our few days were nice only for the staff in the hotel.
As soon as we got out of the lift on our floor we were hit with the worst smell of damp. The carpet on the corridor was discoloured from the damp. Our room was OK. I certainly wouldn't call it a suite. To me a suite is fancy and stocked with things that regular rooms wouldn't have. Our suite had 2 bedrooms a small kitchen area with fridge toaster kettle microwave and sink and a bathroom. There were water stains all around the sink, there was no cold water in the sink so if you ran the hot tap for a couple of mins you got scalded. There were cloths or cleaning products to clean we has to use hand towels. There was no tea, coffee or sugar which we had in our previous room. Half tge TV channels in the twin bedroom didn't work and the remote for the TV in the main bedroom was missing. I requested a remote and never got 1. There was a large towel in our bathroom with the hotel name THE MORGAN on it. Stains on carpet in twin room and some strange silver sticky stuff stuck to the carpet between the 2 single beds. On our last morning I found an earwig crawling on the single bed. Thankfully no one had slept in this bed but my daughter had been sleeping in the bed next to it for 3 nights.
Upon checkout we were greeted by a lady who told us we owed €56.90. When I enquire what this was for she told me it was for breakfast on the 1st 2 mornings which I had booked and paid for previously. I showed her my email confirmation and she tried to tell me the amount I paid was for room only even though my confirmation clearly stated that I added and paid for breakfast. After 10 mins of arguing my point and trying to sort a restless 10 month old and 3 year old a manager came out and told me it was a system error but asked me to forward him a copy of my email confirmation.
This hotel in my opinion is worse than faulty towers.
The only good thing about this hotel is the breakfast and the front of house and restaurant staff.
This hotel needs a serious update of decor and guest facilities especially in the family suites. Don't let the reception and restaurant areas fool you. They look lovely and are well kept but once you go through the double doors to your room that's where the attraction ends. 2 stars are generous. Only reason for 2 stars is the staff, the location is convenient and the breakfast is very nice.",1,2022,03,27
249,Never again!,"We booked a one night stay as a treat for our kids over midterm break. We had stayed in this hotel previously in 2019 and were impressed with the family suite due to its size and lay out for families. 

I regrettably didn't even consider checking tripadvisor reviews as I presumed our stay would be the same as beforehand.

It was extremely disappointing. Upon arrival, the receptionist was unfriendly and I had to ask for all information regarding the pool & facilities etc. She didn't even wish us a nice stay or acknowledge our children who were so excited for their stay. 

We made our way to the room in the elevator. And when we arrived to our floor, we were disgusted with the state of the carpets and walls in the halls. Old dinner trays left outside rooms from the night beforehand (which were not cleared even by the next morning!) And the smell was just sickening. It is like a must or damp smell that lingers into the bedrooms.

The room was fine, not fussy but relatively clean. Apart from underneath the beds.

The pool was a disaster. We arrived before 9am and were told kids were not allowed until after 9am, nobody had informed us of this while checking in. And the lady on the pool reception was unfriendly again & unhelpful. 

The pool itself was horrific. It was filthy! A grit lined the floor of the baby pool! And all guests with us noted that their was some sort of paper & debree floating throughout the pool!

Just completely unacceptable! We will never return and will not recommend to anyone! 

**also to note we had dinner in liffey valley and returned at 7.30pm, we were turned away from the carpark and had to try and find parking elsewhere. Where we felt the car was unsafe to leave. We demanded a parking spot Ns after 30mins were allowed to reenter the hotel underground carpark with no explanation??? Our kids were exhausted.",1,2022,03,24
249,Customer service is non existent and ruined a potentially great stay.,"Booked a suite for a night away as a family of 4. The suite suited our needs perfectly but that's where the good experience ended. There was no towels available for any guests using the pool on the afternoon we arrived. We had no access to our room as our room wasn't ready but they were unable to help with the provision of towels for us or anyone else. Half the pool was closed for swimming lanes,  the kids pool was closed due to a recent contamination,  they had a water babies class using another quarter of the pool so all guests had to squeeze into a quarter share of the pool. The staff were very unfriendly,  at check in there was no directions given to where breakfast was served or where we would be dining that evening. I couldn't get an answer from reception  for 30 minutes when calling from the hotel landline. It was eventually answered when I called from my mobile phone.  The next morning during breakfast I tried to bring my child to the ladies toilet in the main lobby. All 4 cubicles were unbelievably filthy at 9am. They obviously had not been cleaned from the night before.  I alerted the 2 staff on reception who just looked at each other and gave no reply,  not even an apology or offer of access to any other toilet.  I went back 30 minutes later and they were still filthy and had not been cleaned. I had to return to my room to use the toilet. 
Management seriously need to address the poor service and obviously badly or insufficiently trained staff. The hotel has great potential but I know I'll never pay a cent to stay here or let anyone I know stay here either. ",1,2022,02,28
249,Awful experience,"Been there with my two kids: the worst hotel never been. Really expensive, really dirty. Everything was dirty, from the room with blood on the walls to the glasses at the breakfast. Don't mention when the fire alarm starts to go off and on for about half a hour around 11 pm when the kids were asleep. On top of all they charged me twice and I'm still waiting for the refund. Never again.",1,2022,02,27
249,Family mid term stay,"Just back from a 2 night stay for midterm with 3 kids ages 10, 7 and 5. I would not recommend this hotel for a family break, there are no kids facilities, no playground, kids club, kids area, no kids breakfast the pool is good and has a lovely small toddler pool however it is very badly run there were no towels available we had to use towels fr om bedroom and half the pool was sectioned off for lane swimming for adults only, my 10 yr old is a good swimmer and was enjoying the lane swimming and was asked to stay out of the lanes 
We stayed in a family suite and it was a very good size but it was very dark and warm and the carpet wasn't clean  there was a stall smell of cigarette smoke in the room  the shower curtain in the bathroom was filthy.
We ate in the gusto restaurant and the food was not good, we had no other option as bar was booked out, the restaurant was self service with v limited option s and food was cold and very unappetising. The breakfast was average at best, kids were very disappointed that there were no pancakes which are a feature of most family hotels. We had a drink in the bar, sofas were stained my husband had a pint of Guinness and a pint if coors both were warm and glass was dirty.
In our second night the fire alarm sounded for about 30 mins on and off at app 10.30pm when kids were sleeping we all had to evacuate the rooms but nobody knew what was going on communication  was terrible.
The only redeeming factor in this hotel were the staff  every single staff member we met were so nice and pleasant and helpful, the hotel is in a very good location but it needs serious tlc and updating and proper management of the facilities that are there. We have stayed in many family friendly hotels In ireland and this was by far the poorest.",1,2022,02,27
249,Ella from front of house is a credit to the Clayton Group.,All I can say is that Ella from front of house is just amazing! She saved this whole trip from being a disaster. She went above and beyond for me as a customer. I would simply come back just for her. She's a credit to the Clayon Hotel Group. Truly can't thank her enough. This would have been an awful review if it wasn't for her stand out personality!,5,2022,02,25
249,Swimming pool staff really unprofessional!,"I have just checked out of this hotel after a mid week stay with my family including 3 children ages 5, 8 and 10. 
The rooms are spacious for families and the breakfast was very good, in particular Sharon in the restaurant was very attentive and looked after us so well each morning, she really went the extra mile for the children and was so welcoming. The part that really let our stay down was when we went to use the swimming pool. 
On arrival I popped to the leisure reception to enquire if I needed to pre book/wear swimming caps/checked if any extra measures I needed to be aware of and was told no that I could just bring the children and that all extra measures were now lifted. When I returned with the 3 children half an hour later the same man gave us our towels, told us where to change etc and to have lots of fun to the kids! When ready and about to go into the pool a staff member stopped us and said we couldn’t enter the pool as none of us were wearing swimming caps. 
I explained to him that we had checked that with reception and told they weren’t required, but this staff member said we absolutely could not enter the pool without one and that I would need to get changed and go back upstairs to reception to purchase 4 caps for 3 euros each. I looked at the pool and noted that out of approximately 20 people in the pool (adults and children) only 6 were wearing caps!! I queried this with the staff member, but was told they hadn’t listened to him and that the manager would be coming to speak to them or remove them from the pool. I had no problem in buying the caps but surely it must be same rule for everybody??!!
So I purchased the caps, the kids had a great time in the pool and eventually noticed the ‘manager’ come to the pool side. He did not ask the other families to go and buy swimming caps, he did not approach any of the many single swimmers who were Lane swimming.. just started laughing and joking with one couple and getting pool floats out for their children! I felt so frustrated that I had been made to pay 12 euro for 4 caps when these other people in the pool weren’t even challenged by the manager in the end! I spoke to another family who had also been made to buy the caps and they were just as frustrated as me. Surely everyone should be treated the same..absolutely appalling customer service from the leisure centre staff and in particular the dark male who I was later informed to be a supervisor!!! Absolutely would not recommend this hotel due to its extremely poor swimming pool staff.",1,2022,02,25
249,Terrible Restaurant Service,"I stayed here during the week with a large family. The hotel was nice and clean with very spacious family rooms. The pool area was excellent, a little overcrowded but nothing the hotel can do about that. Lovely kids pool. 

The major issue we had was the service in the restaurant. It was absolutely horrendous. I have never witnessed anything like it before. We had a party of 9 at the table and it took up to 20 minutes for our order to be taken. The food was very slow to arrive. Once it came it was very nice. 

Terrible service in the Restaurant. At one stage we ordered five ice creams for our children and three cocktails for the adults. The cocktails came to our table nearly immediately, but the desserts did not arrive at all. I had to look for a manager and ask him to please bring out the deserts as our children were waiting for them for 30 minutes and if they did not arrive soon we would have to leave. Unacceptable!

There was no shortage of staff working in the restaurant the evening we had our meal but at one stage I counted seven people behind a bar doing nothing. The waiting staff seemed very inexperienced. 

There was no sign of any manager floating around the restaurant making sure that things were okay for each table which would be normal practice in a restaurant. Not once were we asked how everything was. 

When our bill arrived the waitress stood over our shoulder looking at us as we analysed our bill. We had to ask her to give us a few minutes to check that everything was okay. This was extremely unprofessional. 

The meal itself was very very nice and I have no complaints for the kitchen. 

Also I would be very concerned about security in the hotel. I left my room key in my room and went to the reception late one evening for a replacement. I only had to mention my room Number and I was given a new one. No verification from the receptionist. I could have gotten into anyones room. 

We may return to the hotel again as the location is great as the pool was lovely for the kids but we will not dine in the restaurant.",2,2022,02,24
249,Poison at a Price!,"I had attended a family wedding at the hotel on 19/02/22. As the party had assembled downstairs in the main bar, I along with others seemed very frustrated as to how long people had to wait to get served at the bar as there seemed to be an adequate amount of staff present. I had asked for a pint of Guinness and a pint of Coors and the bar lady had informed me that there was no Coors. I    pointed to the 2 Coors taps and she then said that the Coors keg had not been connected yet and would let me know when it was. My wife just settled for a water instead and I had the Guinness as it seemed to take a long time to get the Coors up and running. The Guinness wasn't great either at a price of €5.80  and all when I thought it couldn't get any worse, upstairs in the function room I ordered a pint of Guinness at €6.30!! off the young barman and on drinking it, it tasted as if there was disinfectant in it. I immediately brought it back up to the bar and the manager interviened stating that the barman was supposed to throw out the first 4 pints to flush out the line after the cleaning process. 
On a good note, the food was delicious. The venue itself is very clean, clean toilets etc.but unfortunately I did have to leave  prematurely. Even when I got home my daughter said there was a smell of disinfectant off me. My only advice going forward would be staff retraining, Guinness quality checks and drop your prices. After all you are not exactly nearTemple Bar!!",1,2022,02,24
249,Disappointing stay,"I was very disappointed with our stay. Have stayed here numerous times but couldn’t believe how run down it has got.  The hotel was filthy and the service was awful. We had a family suite on the third floor and the smell of mould in the hallway was disgusting . 
I had dinner booked for the Friday night of which they had no record and weren’t very apologetic either. 
The pool is a fine place except when we arrived they had no towels . 
Will never be staying here again",2,2022,02,14
249,friendly staff and great food,"i stayed here on friday night and was welcomed by really friendly front office staff and then bar staff. while i couldn't catch all of their names i remember who i believe was pawel.

the 8oz sirloin steak was one of the best i had and so was the tomato bruschetta and cocktails. what was even better was how short the wait time was, i honestly expected to be waiting a lot longer for my food in what was a really busy bar but got it swiftly within about 15-25 minutes.

the room was very spacious with a very comfortable bed, i'm really pleased!

sadly my trip was short-lived but what i had of the breakfast was really good too and presented really nicely in their buffet. the waiting staff and hosts were very welcoming. ",4,2022,02,13
249,Avoid at all costs,Im young and I have never complained about any hotel but this hotel has got to be the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. I have a very long list of complaints which I emailed to the manager but I will just state the worst ones. Please do not bring children to this hotel as there are drugs and prostitutes on every floor. My partner had to lock the door to our room while I was downstairs as someone tried they’re hardest to force entry into our room. The bar and reception service was the worst I’ve experienced. There is a lot more but i will leave it there. Also I emailed this list to the manger before leaving any reviews and I was offered a free stay as compensation but the manger has since refused to answer any of my emails.,1,2022,02,10
249,Very underwhelming,"I was staying in this hotel for 2 nights. 
First of all I had to change rooms due to the stains on the carpet as I had a baby who would be crawling on the floor and it was very bad. Thankfully I did get a change of room but stains should not be so severe.

My new room the balcony door was broken so there was a bad draft coming in the door during our stay but I did not have the heart to ask for another change so I had to keep the curtains closed to keep the heat in. 

I was with my baby and parents and we went down to get a bite to eat and were told that there were no tables available. I’ve booked into a hotel for a stay and I can’t eat in the restaurant? That’s a first for me. As it was getting late and I had a young baby I did not have time to drive around to find somewhere so we had no choice but to use their click and collect to the room. We ordered 2 burgers, fish and chips and a kids meal. €70! €70 to collect food from reception and go and sit in our room to eat. The quality was not great for the price paid.

We were unaware that we had to book breakfast until another guest mentioned it so we went on to book breakfast again to be told there were no slots available for breakfast. We had paid for bed and breakfast but were being told there was no availability. We ran reception and after debate finally got a table booked. 

We stayed two nights and neither my room or my parents room got fresh towels or any kind of a tidy up on the second day. 

Lastly, I received a call to say my stay had not been paid for even though I had completed check in and payment taken out. The guy on the phone said ‘I’ll get back to you we had booking errors’ - best practise would be to check your accounting system before phoning guests to say they haven’t paid when they clearly have? 

Overall, a very poor and disorganised stay.",2,2022,02,10
249,Close to shops ,Very convenient to shopping centre.  This hotel has great staff. They are so helpful.  The food in the bar is quite good. We had a big and spacious family suite. The only negative about it was the stains on the carpet.  Really brought the room down. Other than that great.,5,2022,02,03
249,Look after yourself stay somewhere else,"Stayed for work, the only positive part of my stay was the room was clean and bed was comfy, it went down hill after that, check in was online, handy when got to desk staff gave me key and said through the doors and elevator to 4th floor, went through the doors and elevator was there but only went to 2nd floor, I had to find my way down the Corridor to the elevator that I was sapoose to use, god forbid, reception take 30seconds to explain that I was to use the elevator further down the corridor, after all I checked myself in online making it easier for the hotel, got to room, all good there, thought no more of it, went to bar for food, left waiting to be seated bar staff standing looking at me, only when the manager shows up and says go look after that man does the person looking at me come over check my covid cert and sits me down without a menu, I have to go ask different staff to get a menu, have to say food was tasty, second night sitting in room, the connecting door to another room  opens and the guest that was in their apologies and goes back in, seriously 😳, what kind of safety/security is this call reception and they sent guy up to lock door, the guest that was in the room had small dog with thin that kept barking anytime a noise happened in the room, all in all one of the worst experiences in hotel in a long time if ever, not one issue a big one on its own, but the snow ball effect made it the worst stay, and will not be returning to this hotel unless I have zero choice, I will pay more to stay somewhere else,",1,2022,01,23
249,Great stay every time & helpful staff !,"Staying here plenty of times , nothing but great service from all the girls at the desk especially Ciara , anything you need or request so helpful with 
Love staying will be back the weekend 
Great bar too",5,2022,01,21
249,Relaxing break away,"I stayed in clayton hotel liffey valley throughout the year for work and stayed last night for leisure. I would highly recommend this hotel for all types of stay whether be family,work or solo. There is plenty of parking . The staff throughout are very friendly and helpful. The hotel public areas are clean and well maintained. The bedrooms are spacious, clean and have super comfy bed. There are little extras in the room like fan and  fridge. The hotel is close by to liffey valley shopping centre. This hotel is great value for money. The breakfast is delicious and excellent variety of foods to suit all tastes . I would like to wish the team clayton hotel liffey valley happy new year.

249,"Lovely stay, thank you Patryjia","Patrycja in the resturant WoW, excellent service with a lovely attitude, a total credit to this beautiful hotel, coulnt praise enough, had a lovely break, rooms very clean and reception always polite, but every night Patryjia was our shining light 5 star",5,2021,12,18
249,Wonderful service from Patrycja,Absolutely fantastic service from this lady and a real laugh. 10/10 service and couldn’t recommended highly enough. Not bad wait for the food to come out so wasn’t left waiting long to be fed. Will visit again,5,2021,12,18
249,Family Xmas Trip,"Annual Xmas pilgrimage to our favourite hotel, and safe to say standards have not slipped!  Excellent customer service on check in (Ciara) who got us an early check in and was very friendly!  Evening meal was fantastic with a great menu choice for adults & kids - we had a very large group who were catered for our every need, special mention to “Usman” who was so friendly and helpful, especially with the kids!  Well done to all and we will be back!",5,2021,12,05
249,Not a 4 star,"The rooms are decent enough but need  a deep clean. There seems to be a constant smell of smoke in the corridors and some rooms. 
The corridors are dirty and grubby. the whole place could do with a freshen up. It can also be very noisy at night time with guests banging doors and shouting. 
I ate once in the restaurant and never again. The only way to describe the food was muck. Pasta arribiata that should have never been put on a plate. Theres no way a chef prepared it. 
Only positives are the location and the staff in fairness are friendly and helpful.",2,2021,12,01
249,"Just how? The food is dire. Like honestly, its borderline scandalous.","So I have stayed here a few times over the last few months. 
For work, so I am spending the majority of my evening in the hotel, and am forced to eat here due to this. 
First night? Steak, 29euro, managed to be over cooked and under-cooked by not being charred properly on the grill, raw onions and mushrooms and one strange little potato gratin kind of thing?  that was oily and gross. 

Second evening, chicken burger, the bun was toasted but still managed to be stale? which begs the question of how stale this bun could be? The chips were like oven chips. it was just grim. all for 16-18 euro. 

Third night, Arrabiata pasta? ow holy chr**st. watery, dramatically over cooked pasta, no spice what so ever, kind of like a cheap knock-off of dolmio sauce from the 59cent range from tesco, with little chunks of probably boiled chicken and hot dog sausages???? with no parmesan a scattering of poorly chopped herbs. and a half a ciabatta, was cut down the middle, toasted, with garlic butter on the smallest the piece of ciabatta? that just makes no sense. 

the Nasi Goreng? Which included? mini-frozen shrimp, little pieces of chicken? Pilau rice? looked like something and tasted like something you would get from an uncle bens rice packet. and stale prawn crackers that one could find in a bad chinese take away? 

I just can't stress enough, that the food here is awful. But, okay if it were priced accordingly, I might say yes thats okay, you pay for what you get? But I would implore the management of this company to take a genuine look at the quality of the food being handed out here. 

All the staff are really nice and attentive. the service was good. But the food guys, i dont know how they get away with it.",1,2021,11,29
249,Not 4 star quality,"Extremely noisy, we were woken by the hotel manager arguing on the corridor about how many guests were in another room. This was at 2:00 am and shortly afterwards a party started in the room across the corridor. Constant banging of doors all night. The room itself was comfortable but very grubby. Staff were friendly in the restaurant and breakfast was absolutely delicious. The front of house staff left a lot to be desired and the lady checking us in gave us absolutely no information whatsoever, she couldn’t have been less interested if she tried. Not the worst hotel ever but absolutely not deserving of its 4 star rating.",2,2021,11,28
249,Convenient.,"Situated within a few minutes drive from the M50, this is a very convenient hotel. We visited when some restrictions were still in place, but this didn’t really cause any issues.

Staff were friendly, rooms good and lots of parking. We had a meal in the bar which whilst simple, was better than a lot of other pub meals.",4,2021,11,23
249,Disappointing for a 4 star hotel,"A night away with my husband and decided to stay at the clayton 4 star, on arrival there was no greeting, the young lady was just there to do a job no anything, we got our key and Went to the third floor, on leaving the eleovater we walked along two long corridors to get to our room.
The room was alright been in better 2 stars, the room was tried then cleanses of the room and bathroom was not good, there were long hairs on the tiles, the sink and bath both had the plugs in with water still left in them.
Curtains ripped, iron mark on the carpet, the bedroom was also an adjoining room so we had the pleasure of listening to sneezing, loud TV and children up at 5am.
Definitely would not go to stay at a clayton hotel again, definitely over priced and needs to spend some money on updating.",1,2021,11,09
249,"Room good and well appointed. Stay let down by disappointing, disorganised restaurant service.","No issue with room, well prepared and clean. Hallways and stairwells were very dirty. Restaurant was dreadful. Poor service, staff disorganised, ridiculously long wait to be served with either food or drink. Distinct impression that staff did not know who was serving who, what and when. Will not be returning.",2,2021,10,31
249,"No cleaning, no paper toilet, no tissues, dirty fridge, missing pillows, bad mattress,","Highly not recommended.
We checked online 1 day before to facilitate, the receptionist asked  to wait to confirm if it was ready.
At the room no paper toilet, no tissues, dirty fridge, missing pillows, uncomfortable mattress.
A “saga” to get Paper toilet, 2 phone calls at the reception, 1 email sent (never  answered), and after 40 minutes the paper toilet finally arrived at 21:00!!!
No cleaning even we put the sign by the door.
Awful location, the worst hospitality experience that I could have, far to be 4* hotel with this kind of quality, service and assistance.
It is not worth what we payed.",1,2021,10,20
249,Clayton review,"Absolutely shocking attitude from staff
Thinking of staying here....do yourself a favour and skip it. The worst hotel staff I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. Rude, dismissive and incompetent. The actual bar manager on 16/10/21 at 10.30pm and 7 bar staff leave alot to be desired in terms of customer service. Absolutely disgusted.",1,2021,10,16
249,Standards have slipped way down,"Recently had a 1 night family stay. We have stayed in the hotel numerous times over the years and never had any problems. This year however I feel the standards of the place have dropped considerably which is disappointing.
Check in-no real problems as we had checked in online.
Rooms- could do with a deep clean
Pool- Has to be booked to restrict numbers, perfectly understandable. However, the problem is then everyone is coming out at the same time, there are no showers available and 3/4s of the lockers are not accessible. So people are on top of eachother in the tight changing areas. 
Restaurant- Don't know where to start. Without trying to sound horrible the majority of the staff should not be employed in hospitality sector. It's a mixture of bad attitude, incompetency, laziness, lack of management , failure to enforce COVID measures which for majority of customers were non existent. In case anyone thinks I'm hard to please (far from it), when we eventually got to order, one of the 2 drinks was wrong, we got food and then had to call someone and ask for cutlery, then had to ask for sideplates as were sharing stater, that never arrived. In a nutshell the restaurant staff are not suitably trained/supervised in how to work in such a setting. 
Breakfast- the only positive of the stay. Breakfast crew are very professional. 
Sad to say won't be returning anymore",2,2021,09,27
249,Awful,Incompetent staff with stupid rules that’s contradict themselves. Made my sister cry. Really horrible check in even though it was done online took 20 mins and only one of our rooms were ready manager was just as bad as the front desk staff,1,2021,09,25
249,Stay at Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley,Was a great stay a special thanks to Samuel in the gym for amazing playlists and friendliness and to Joyce for amazing service. A very nice breakfast and pool as well to top off the morning. Cant wait to go back.,5,2021,09,24
249,Sort out the restaurant,"Lovely hotel, great goons, staff brilliant and food good too👍
However the set up in the restaurant is crazy crazy. 30€ for basically a buffet. You’re not allowed order just a main course, it has to be at least two courses. The staff try to explain the menu but it really is all over the place. A medley of desserts like a wedding. 
I’m sorry guys but give a person a few choices for starter, mains and dessert and stop trying to be something you’re not. 
Again a huge thank you to all the staff that helped us, ye were all fab
All the best guys
Thanks a mil",4,2021,09,19
249,Good Hotel,"Well placed just off the M50, rooms were clean and staff helpful.
We have stayed here a number of times and our stay this time was very pleasant, breakfast being well organised. Validated parking on site at 6 euro a night. It is within a 5 minute walk of the local Liffey Valley shopping centre.",4,2021,09,19
249,Great Stay,"Great stay and brilliant customer service.

Food in  Italian restaurant fabulous. 
Special thanks to Shannon who was very helpful and customer service was excellent 10 out of 10.
Nice place to celebrate my daughters birthday.

249,Poor Customer Service,"Started awful with no dinner reservation pool reservation and very unhelpful staff. we had booked for 4 nights. No cot ready in the room for toddler in bad need of a nap, as we couldn't get lunch we ordered click and collect. at 4:55 three trips later our food was ready it was then 6:15pm!!! apparently when you order reception bring it to the kitchen they never did. Received a phone call from the manager Glen on the first night who arranged two meal and swimming slots for us and asked to meet us in the bar on the third night to buy us a drink as a sorry. He never showed up. I requested housekeeping by putting the cut-out on the door. they never showed I asked  reception for extra toiletries and towels.  I was told to request housekeep and any items needed through the app. The room was not cleaned at any stage during our 4 night stay. we didn't get toiletries nor towels. i emailed glen back but never got a reply .We wont be going back to the clayton Liffey Valley.",2,2021,09,09

249,Amazing family time at the hotel,"We had a great time at the hotel, the staff  was very friendly, we enjoyed our dinner at the bar, the food was delicious. My kids were so happy having good time at the pool. Thank you all, definitely we are going to be back again. We got delicious welcome gift. Thank you !!!",5,2021,08,26
249,Not really a break.,Just back from a 3 nite stay which we ended after 2 nights as the Covid Rules in the Hotel did not give us the feeling of been Holiday.on Check in the Lovely Girl told us we had to book everything Breakfast Dinner Bar Gym Pool which all had a time limit and the Bar was a deal breaker for me I don't make appointments to have a pint.staff were lovely room was very nice and with not much to do in the Area we decided to leave as we would rather stay at home now till restrictions end and eat and drink when we choose.,4,2021,08,25
249,Some issues but still a good hotel,"Our experience was a mixed bag. Our room was not ready on our arrival and we had to wait to 6:30pm to finally get it, rushing to get our swim appointment for quarter to. The hotel gave us a late check out to compensate but our key stopped working at the normal time and cleaning staff were knocking at the door thinking we were late checking out. 

We attended Gusto Restaurant and got a very confusing explanation of the set up. Basically we could order a pizza and also have access to a buffet. A bit strange, but we all ordered pizzas. Half arrived, the other half didn’t. The waiter had a word with the pizza maker who told him he had missed half the order but had decided it was time for him to go home, so half our party were left without. Pretty poor by any standard but to be fair to the hotel, the waived the adults meals and we paid for the alcohol and kids meals only. 

From then on things improved. The rooms are excellent, good WiFi, clean, relatively large and well equipped. I really liked them. Bathroom decent. There was no air conditioning and it’s quite hot in the room at night. 

The second night we headed to the bar instead of the restaurant which was an entirely better experience. Much better variety, excellent food and great service from Iago. We had a very pleasant experience. 

Overall, there were some difficulties but at least the hotel tried to put it right. There are a lot of things to like about this hotel and despite the issues, I would still recommend and return again for a stay.",3,2021,08,22
249,Excellent Family Hotel,"We had the best stay in the Clayton Liffey Valley Dublin, from the moment we got there the staff were amazing & so friendly from reception, restaurant & bar we could not recommend it highly enough. The breakfasts were so filling & the meals in the bar & restaurant were divine. The hotel was so central for Tayto Park, The Zoo & Fort Lucan. The shopping centre beside the hotel was an added bonus for both adults & children. Roll on our next trip",5,2021,08,20
249,perfect break away,"We had booked interconnecting rooms for 3 nights. On arrival at 5pm our interconnecting room was not ready, but the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We went to our swimming slot and when we came back our travel cot was set up in the interconnecting room. Breakfast was perfect, service was brilliant and staff were friendly. We had dinner in the hotel bar on 2 evenings and also could not fault it in anyway, food and service was brilliant.
This hotel is in a great location, the pool is lovely and clean, as are the bed rooms. The rooms are a bit dated and could do with a bit of a revamp but cleanliness could not be faulted. We did have to request extra towels during the stay but the staff were very accommodating. Check out online was so easy and saved a long que. Overall it was a lovely stay and we will defiantly be back.",5,2021,08,20
249,The Most Friendly Staff,"We stayed at the Clayton Liffey Valley for one night and couldn't recommend it more. When we arrived at the hotel, we were able to check in within minutes. Our receptionist who checked us in was polite and courteous. When our room wasn't ready, she swiftly upgraded us to a spacious apartment suite with no hesitation. Such a lovely welcome and good start to our stay!

We had dinner last night in the Gusto restaurant, where the staff were equally helpful and accommodating. The price was reasonable and there was a great variety of Italian options available. When reserving our dinner time, I mentioned it was my friends birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make it a special one. Every waiter and waitress we spoke to was so helpful, but especially Julia the hostess and Stacey who brought us our drinks. 

Overall, we had a lovely time and would definitely recommend staying here.",4,2021,08,18
249,Excellent,"We stayed in the Clayton recently & had a wonderful stay. Our room was spacious with very comfortable beds. We chose the hotel for its location to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and it was ideal. 

The food was lovely in the bar & Mervyn was very attentive to all customers. The breakfast was delicious too and we had excellent service from Mark.  Prebook inclusive dinner & breakfast. 

The leisure facility is really nice but please keep in mind that they do have to follow strict covid rules so the pool is divided in to sections for families. Prebook 

The only small thing I’d say is that it was extremely difficult to hear the receptionist on check in & although I’m not hearing impaired I know a hearing impaired person would struggle a bit.",5,2021,08,18
249,"Good stay, hotel could do with a deep clean","Just back from stay at Clayton Liffey Valley. Hotel is in a good location beside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, lots of good shops and restaurants closeby. We had interconnecting rooms in the hotel. Whilst housekeeping did their best with providing fresh towels and linen, the rooms could do with a deep clean, sticky marks on carpets, curtains and furniture. There was poor ventilation in the rooms and they had a bit of a musty smell. Apart from this, the staff were all lovely, the food at breakfast and dinner was nice. We didn't get to use the pool as it was booked up in advance. Overall, if the hotel were to spend a little bit more in an industrial clean of their rooms, then I would recommended it and would go back.",3,2021,08,16
249,Shocked,"This was embarrassing  trip for me and my family, 
Online we booked a gym for my 16 year old son and my 19 year old daughter and when we came to check our booking they refused me for being underage and they allowed us to book online, at breakfast the service was very slow we had to ask people and sometimes they ignored us, my aunt was with us she hated the place the beds were here hard and we had a room with a window and the heat was imbareable",1,2021,08,15
249,Great break,"Just back from two nights at the Clayton. The main thing that makes the hotel great is the excellent staff! So attentive and couldn't do enough for our group! Especially Julia in the restaurant she was a fab host and was extremely good at her job!

Looking forward to going back!",4,2021,08,11
249,Great family stay!,"Family party of 10 stayed this week and couldn't fault this hotel. The staff were amazing and were so accommodating. The food was lovely and we left the Gusto restaurant very well fed. The location was great too, close to shopping, restaurants and entertainment so plenty to do. Will definitely return next year.",5,2021,08,11
249,Never again!,"Stayed here as a family on 1st august, and I have to say I will never be back!

The only thing good about this place was the food in the bar. Got to room and there was a half eaten biscuit still on the floor from the previous occupants. 

Had the worst family ever staying on my floor, kids running riot in the hall and banging on people’s door. This continued right up until 2am. I rang down to reception but they clearly did nothing about it because they just didn’t stop. I gave up calling to report to reception after the 4th call because what was the point?!

£219 spent for the worst stay I’ve ever had in any hotel. ",2,2021,08,09
249,Unreal,"We stayed here on the 7th. The hotel is amazing & the staff were so friendly and helpful. We had one extra person and expected a pullout bed but they were able to give us a room with an extra bed. Dinner was lovely. Our server, I think his name was Usman, couldn’t do enough for us. It was obvious that he was super busy and still kept everything together.",5,2021,08,09
249,Amazing family orientated hotel,"Amazing stay from start too finish.
Seems like a real family orientated hotel 
I stayed with my 2 nieces and my daughter and it was great. The food in the bar was absolutely gorgouse and not expensive at all . We had 3 starters 1 main coarse and 4 drinks all for 50euro
Will definitely return
Only downfall was we could not get a booking into the swimming pool. Also I could not get a cappuccino anywhere at 10am 🤨(I am a coffeeaholic) 🤣🤣
Honestly doh a great place and just walking distance too liffyvalley shopping centre.
Staff were also great
If your looking for night away with no kids I would not recommend.  I will defo be back with all my kids 🤣
Thabks for a great stay ",4,2021,08,07
249,Excellent  hotel,"We booked a one night stay for a mini break with our three kids.   Checked in online.    Check in is at 4. We arrived at 330 and I checked incase room was ready, our allocated room wasn’t ready but the lovely receptionist checked and gave us another room which was ready so we got to our room early. No queues for reception.  Room was deluxe family room, a double and two singles and we had requested a travel cot which was to be sent up later (as we had got new room on check in, it had to be sent up).  We walked to Liffey valley shopping centre, very short walk, had forgotten to book dinner in hotel and was able to order dinner by click and collect to our room either from bar or the Italian. We opted for pizzas which were delicious.  The travel cot hadn’t arrived so called down to reception and was assured it would be sent up and it was sent up immediately.  My two year old slept perfect in it, it was like new, immaculate travel cot.  Had breakfast booked and we were given table  in bar.  Service was fantastic.  Order taken as soon as sat down, kids menu and crayons and paper for kids to colour.  Food couldn’t have been fresher and no waiting around but we weren’t rushed either.  Highly recommend this hotel.  I never leave reviews but was delighted with our service at Clayton Liffey valley.  Kids really enjoyed the night away.",5,2021,08,06
249,Nice spot ,"My self and my husband and kids stayed here for 4 nights, check in was smooth, had a laugh with the girl on check in, nice and friendly. 
We booked a suite, and kids were delighted with the balcony! The rooms were very hot, but we asked for fans witch were sent up in no time.
Swimming was great, nicely organized considering what's going on. 
Had dinner in the bar on 2 nights, the food was amazing! We dined with another couple and one of them had special dietary requirements, witch the hotel catered for with no problems what so ever.
My only complaint is that the room could have been cleaner on arrival. But yes I'm sure we as a family will be back for another stay at this hotel 
",5,2021,08,06
249,2 night family package,"We booked a 2 night stay for two adults and two children. Booked interconnecting rooms. On arrival there was a queue for check in (4pm). The reception staff moved quickly through and I found check in to be a smooth and efficient process. We had dinner booked on the first night of our stay in Gustos restaurant. Staff were lovely and we enjoyed the meal. On the 2nd night of our stay we dined in the Globe bar (which was booked prior to arrival), again staff were lovely food was delicious. 
Breakfast each morning was served in Gustos all table service no complaints at all.
Our rooms were clean & comfortable.
I can honestly say we had an enjoyable stay and would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again.",4,2021,08,04
249,Very Disappointing,When we arrived check in was very slow and waited about 35 minutes to get a room. Then when we got a room we were given one that hadn’t been cleaned and looked like someone had just left it as there was rubbish all over the place. We had booked this hotel to use the pool but it was fully booked as we hadn’t received an email that was suppose to be sent out for us to book it same with the breakfast so we had to settle with a 7am breakfast. Another disappointing aspect was the room as the iron was broken and there was a hole in one of our towels. We have stayed here 3 times in the past and never had a problem but after this time we won’t be coming back.,2,2021,08,04
249,"Disgusting Rooms, Rude & Aggressive Staff","The rooms aren't cleaned, at all; sticky soda spills on the dresser, crushed water bottles under the bed, rubbish in all the bin. you can make a reservation for meals but don't expect them to be honoured And don't try to address any of this with the staff as they'll get all up in you face (aggressive AF) insisting that it's your fault for not chasing  after them to ensure they're doing their job (pretty sure he was a manager too). Never ever staying here or any other Clayton hotel ever again, a more hygienic and better value use of the money spent in Clayton Liffey Valley would have been as toilet paper. Total rip off and thoroughly disgusting place. The Globe Bar served congealed mayonnaise (like it had been sitting out all night).",1,2021,08,02
249,"Avoid, staff were rude and not helpful.","On arrival for check in we waited in que with 3 staff members at reception with one only taking a check in. When we to got check in the girl was rude and not helpful. After dropping bags to room came down to get food in the bar to be told very rudely that no not allowed even though the place had only two table full.  Would not advise, I have stayed in alot of other Clayton Hotels a big let down very disappointing start to our holiday. Will not be back",1,2021,07,30
249,Disaster,"We travelled as a family 2 adults and one toddler. What a disaster. We checked in and we were given the furthest room in the hotel and it was also disabled. I rang to ask for it to be changed for them to change us to the basement looking out at generators. 

We also called the evening to see if there was a slot for swimming everything fully booked. So we decided to stroll over to the park. Not one staff member from reservations to reception told us it was closed due to Covid. Does Covid not affect influencencers and their gifted stays? This seems to be the hotels main focus. Why get them to promote the hotel but fail to deliver the full information?? Never again!!",1,2021,07,30
249,Fantastic Hotel,"Hi Guys again very professional  Staff Running the Hotel. Rooms were Clean and Beds very Comfortable 
Food Excellent we had Breakfast and Dinner in the Globe Restaurant & Bar as there was 2 Family's Staying
we had a very Professional and Pleasant Staff Member Who Looked after us on Both Days we Stayed Her
Name was Ina very helpful on choice of food on the Menu and Excellent with Our Children she is a Credit to  
the hotel i would like to say Thank you to Ina for her Service on our Stay and we will Definitely Returning to The Clayton Liffey Valley again",5,2021,07,28
249,Basic hotel with varying service levels,"We arrived at the hotel around 5pm to find a small queue to check in. We soon realised the queue was moving ridiculously slow and everyone seemed to be complaining. We waiting around 35 mins to check in and it seemed the rooms weren’t ready for everyone checking in at 5.30pm which is very strange. We were allocated a room straight away but when we arrived the cleaner was still in it. She obviously tried to finish quickly but we had to call her back as there were marks all over the table etc and there was no toilet paper. 

We had no time to change before our dinner reservation at the Italian so quickly hurried to dinner. The dinner menu wasn’t explained proper and my husband and I tried to order separate starters to be informed it was a sharing platter only, when it arrived the breads were missing and we had to request these. The platter was pretty poor and we barely touched it. We were overly happy to discover it was a Buffet for main course. I thought the save choice would be to order pizza as there was a pizza oven and this would be fresh. Somehow my pizza arrived cold and I had to send it back. When it came again it was pretty poor, the cheese tasted like very cheap quality. I barely touched it. I should point out that I am not overly fussy about pizza!  We ordered desert to get something for our daughter but it was so slow we complained to the duty manager. In fairness he took the food off our bill.

The bed was comfortable and there was a fan in the room which was good in the warm weather. 

Breakfast was good and the service excellent. 

Overly I feel the hotel is greatly overpriced for a basic hotel. If I was staying again I would certainly not eat dinner in the hotel. 

I think the hotel should spend less time gifting stays to influencers and more time sorting out issues. 
That being said I know there are staff shortages in these industries but the food really was to a very poor standard.",2,2021,07,23
249,So disappointing,"We have stayed here a good few times, myself partner and kids.. usually love it and no issues.. however this time we stayed we had a hospital appointment with our son checked in grand everything was perfect, next morning we found out we had to be at the hospital again the following morning, so rather than drive 2 hours back we said we would have to stay another night, I went straight to reception at 7.45 am and explained our situation and asked could we stay another right, we had already paid €200 and we’re willing to pay another €223 as that was the rate, we were told by the guy that they were fully booked so I obviously believed him.. I just happened to check online myself and it showed availability, so I went back he told me website wasn’t updated & there definitely fully booked. I went back a third time showed him availability online still said fully booked.. anyway we had to pack up everything including 2 babies under 2.. in the mean time my partner booked the hotel again as it was allowing him to do so online. Check out was 12. We had to park our car up drive / walk Around until check in again which was 4 pm .. got there nobody’s rooms where ready so we actually didn’t get to our room until 5.30.. 2 babies were so tired at this stage.. we got the exact type of room again, so that guy made us pack up our room and get 2 tired babies ready, travel around all day waiting when we could have just stayed in our room for the extra night , because they did have availability, we booked it online while still in there hotel.. so unnecessary so much added stress when there was no need for it.. I asked to speak to a manger at 5pm that day.. didn’t hear anything until I was checking out the next day, I told him what happened he agreed it was wrong and that member of staff who done this was wrong, and that we should have been allowed stay in the original room for the Extra night as there was in fact availability.. he apologized etc gave me his details and assured me he would look after all of my bookings going forward. As we stay here a good bit due to hospital appointments.. I emailed him 3 weeks later as we need to return in august, absolutely nothing back I called the hotel 4 times to speak to him again noting.. Iv spent €400 in July that’s not even including food, and another €400 plus will be spent in august, absolutely no customer service whatsoever. Such a shame because it is a lovely hotel and the location is great.. only giving 1 star as this trip was already s stressful time for us for our son this just made it so much harder..",1,2021,07,22
249,Girls Trip,"Really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Check in was quick and efficient, rooms were spacious and clean, and the bar was great. Big thanks to Cheri for making our pornstar martinis  they were fab! Will definitely be returning",5,2021,07,16
249,Baby Death Trap,"Please do not stay here if you have young children. 

My family stayed at the Liffey Valley  Hotel on Monday the 28th and flagged a serious issue with regards to the travel cots provided  i.e. in the manner that the bed was provided and set up by hotel staff, there was a significant gap at the bottom of the bed that was large enough for a toddler to roll into, but not roll out of. 

No details on how to properly use the cot were provided and were it not for the fact that our 4yr old for some reason got in to her head that she was a safety inspector that needed to check the beds, we would never have spotted the fault and our 9 month old would almost definitely not be alive today. 

We spent 3 hours, between 7pm and 10pm trying to resolve the issue and ended up needing to spend half the night awake watching our baby asleep in his buggy, and then stay awake watching him asleep in a bed because at 9 months old, he is obviously not able to sleep in a normal bed.

We were told we would be receiving a follow up email, but that never happened. We received a phone call in which the manager said they had looked at the bed and were happy it was fine, despite the video footage we provided that highlights the contrary. We are extremely concerned that the faulty equipment is still being used and the hotel has no intention of improving the safety of this equipment.

What was supposed to be a relaxing night away has become the most stressful event of our lives as we are now constantly picturing what might have happened if our 4yr old hadn't spotted the fault, i.e. the death of our baby, and also the fear that someone else will be putting their baby to bed tonight in a cot that could kill them.

We spent over 200 on the rooms, and nearly the same on dining between dinner and breakfast, we travelled for over 2 hours from Limerick and then back, all for a sleepless, horrifying night that will most definitely have long term effects for us psychologically. For the hotel to argue that they are ""family orientated"" just really isn't true.

I'm not comfortable with the response that was given on the cot safety, at the very least I would assume the hotel would be planning on implementing a policy of their staff checking the cots when they are set up, but this is unlikely as the hotel have completely ceased engaging with us. 

Further more, it is important to note that they offered NO compensation for a sleepless night spent struggling to get an answer or solution to our concerns, which just shows if you have a concern they have no concern with fixing it if you have already paid for your room in full.

Also, the bathroom was not at an adequate standard of cleanliness with the toilet seat actually being yellow at the hinges and clearly uncleaned from the previous guests. The location is poor. The restaurant food is mediocre. The staff are unhelpful and rude. The rooms look onto a car park and it is very noisy in the middle of the night, we heard delivery trucks arriving and cars coming and going at all hours. The rooms were uncomfortably warm when we stayed and we needed to sleep with windows open.

It is the worst hotel stay my family have ever had. Avoid at all costs.",1,2021,07,16
249,Bit disappointed ,"Check in was chaotic. We were told to check in at 4pm as presumably were everyone else, families with kids everywhere. Finally checked in at 5.30. Rooms were clean & the bar still serving ""best ever curry"" & it still is. Booked the restaurant for the next nite & was only when we were seated that we were told we (adults) had to have 2 courses & they (kids) had to have 3!! Menu was very limited & our ""main course"" was served as a carvery.  Workmen staying in the hotel walked around in numbers without a single mask between them.",3,2021,07,14
249,Gusto restaurant,"Great hotel in a great location. Near the Liffey valley shopping centre and plenty of varied restaurants. 
We Ate in the new Gusto restaurant, and were not impressed with it. It’s all you can eat on the main courses so If you prefer quantity over quality this is your place.  If you’re not a big eater this is A little on the expensive side for what you get. One on the wait staff walked around with her mask under her chin and it wasn’t until she came to our table and I pointed it out did she pull it up. 😱",4,2021,07,10
249,Liffey Valley Plus,"This is a large complex which caters for everyone.Large shopping centre nearby.Swimming pool.Underground parking.
It is indeed good to see a large hotel,during the current Covid Pandemic,working to a high degree of professionalism.Everything does go like clockwork.Service with a smile,decent food,nlin check in/out.It is also convenient for Dublin Airport and Visiting.Thank you.",5,2021,07,08
249,Great stay,"Had a great stay and the location was great as a shopping centre 5 minute walk away. Food was amazing although ordering system was confusing in the gusto.
Staff were excellent especially Cristina in the globe bar who was very pleasant and helpful. 
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,07,06
249,Not great,"So im reading all of the other 5* reviews here and i really feel like we stayed in a different hotel. We booked totally last minute as we are having work done in our house. 2 adults and 2 children for 10 nights!!! Yes 10 ....... 
We paid an absolute fortune for the family room (yes i know our choice) decided to try make it our staycation with the kids. The hotel not once offered us any discount on the rate. Fair enough. 
Breakfast in the morning was good and service was good and quick so happy with that. We ate in the bar some evenings and one evening my fish and chips were served cold. I wasnt happy. Sent them back and the manager was very apologetic etc. The hotel pool was fully booked most evenings and werent very accommodating to hotel guests. 
The heat and the noise in the hotel was absolutely ridiculous . One evening a group of people on a balcony making so much noise another evening another group of people in the car park making noise. By the last night, all i wanted to do was check out and go home. The hotel was fine if staying for one/two evenings but it definitely would not be on my list again to stay. Sorry to say.

Also because of Covid no room service. I had to phone several times during our stay to ask for clean towels and toilet roll !!!! Not nice at all really.",2,2021,07,05
249,Nice hotel,"We had a 2 night stay in this hotel with 2 adults and 2 children. At first the hotel itself is stunning and in a perfect location. It is clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel states on their website that it has many kids activities , but we did not see this there. The pool was clean , but for 7 year olds the small side was too shallow and deep side was to deep. There was no activities for kids to do baring in mind most of the people in ireland will be staycationing  with their kids in ireland. The playground was shut, and the only thing kids were giving was a few crayons at the dinner table. This hotel also has no outdoor seating not even a bench to enjoy the weather.",2,2021,07,04
249,Fantastic Stay!,"We booked this hotel for a short stay while we visited Tayto Park and Dublin Zoo.  After a slight setback when our rooms were not ready everything improved. Many thanks to Tammy on reception who was so professional, friendly and helpful. Also to Pawel who tried his very best to sort the issue of the late check in. The hotel was impeccably clean and tidy in all areas. The staff were accommodating and friendly. The pool is very well set up and divided into sections so that each group have their own section. There was a lifeguard on duty each time we visited. The changing areas were spotless and the staff were very helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the future. We will also recommend this hotel to others without hesitation.",5,2021,06,29
249,Great Service,Very clean comfortable room. Child loved the pool and the gym was great for myself. Well looked after by Dillon in the restraunt. Means an awful lot to be greeted and given a sense of welcome which is an experience lacking in a lot of hotels I visited. This was followed by excellent table service from our waiter kerry. Over all very impressed with this hotel.,5,2021,06,25
249,Business Trip,"First time staying in this hotel and I was very pleased with all aspects. Was pleasantly surprised by the standard of coffee, considering the reputation hotel coffee has. Check in was swift and efficient. Room location was perfect, floor was quiet so had no issues in doing my work. Really enjoyed the bar food, opted for the burger and the mee goreng over the 2 nights, and they were both delicious. Staff were great, no ask was too big. Special mentions to Patrycja, Ina, Chloe, Sarah, Cheri and Adam for their service. I will most certainly be staying in this hotel again.",5,2021,06,23
249,Trip with friends,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley. Room was exactly as expected, spacious and clean so no complaints in that regard. Huge credit has to be given to the barstaff for making our stay that bit better. The food was delightful, and the service we received was second to none. Big thank you to Ina, Chloe, Sarah, Patrycja, Adam and Cheri.",5,2021,06,22
249,Short stay on business,"Very much enjoyed stay at this hotel. Efficient and pleasant check in. Room comfortable and spacious and plenty of evidence of adherence to COVID guidelines.

Particularly enjoyed my meal and would call out Cristina for exceptional service.",5,2021,06,21
249,"Nice hotel, hotel staff left out to dry","Can't believe I was served a buffet in a restaurant, food was canteen quality, hotel is extremely understaffed in restaurant, can't blame the staff in the restaurant there was 2 staff  for about 30 tables, management should really hire more staff and support them more. ",1,2021,06,18
249,Family staycation for Dublin Zoo,"Stayed here for 1 night with my husband and 2 year old - wasn't expecting too much as it is a chain hotel and we would usually try to stay in family run places which we typically find the better service in - however, I could not fault this hotel at all!! All of the staff were fabulous to deal with, from reception to dinner to breakfast and to the leisure center!! We had dinner in Gusto's restaurant which was lovely and portion sizes generous - we had a drink beforehand in the bar down the hall which was a bit disappointing - no real atmosphere in it so I would highly recommend to book into Gustos for food and a nice layout and atmosphere. We swam in the pool which was well organised and each family had their own section of the swimming pool. The rooms are a bit dated and basic but served the purpose of a 1 night stay.
Our purpose of visiting was to go to Dublin Zoo which was only a 10 minute drive. 
Highly recommend for a short family stay.",5,2021,06,15
249,Brilliant  stay,"Very pleased with our stay breakfast was beautiful the staff  were brilliant  with the kids even though there were time slots for the pool due to covid  the pool staff  had kindly booked us in for the 3 days we stayed big thanks to all staff from all departments

249,Very disappointed as a family,"Absolutely fuming that I booked a room
This morning asked if there was availability for the pool as this was the purpose of the trip ,told I could book a slot when I arrived . When I got there the reception “ supervisor” told me it was fully booked the whole purpose of our trip . I then had two put two very disappointed girls into the car and drive back to mullingar . The most annoying part is that the receptionist didn’t care didn’t offer to ring one of the other Claytons - nothing . I rang every hotel with a pool in Dublin and all booked by that time .terrible service",1,2021,06,12
249,Family trip,Great COVID measures in place. The bedroom was very clean and great size . I think they have the best staff in any hotel we’ve stayed in . So impressed with our delicious fresh breakfast . Ivo on the first morning was absolutely brilliant at his job  he was very friendly and attentive to our needs and we didn’t have long before our breakfast was brought to us .... We had a beautiful meal in the globe that evening fresh and tasty . On our second morning Ramona was our server for breakfast and she was ever so friendly and smiley and took great pride in her job . She was extremely attentive to us and such a lovely lady . Our stay was fantastic . Definitely be back . Great job Clayton Liffey Valley,5,2021,06,08
249,Staff are exceptional,Stayed with our 2 children for the long weekend. Staff were absolutely exceptional & made our stay so memorable. Nothing was too much trouble & food was amazing! Pool was fab & warm. Pre-booking of restaurant & pool made everything run smoothly. Very child friendly with staff doing everything possible to make sure kids really had the best time. So impressive as a 1st weekend open after lockdown.,5,2021,06,07
249,Very disappointing ,"Booked the hotel well in advance, as I am an organized individual had a two night stay well planned ! I am a repeat customer and as we a coming out of lockdown I was ready for a little bit of a break.....the hotel was just open for business....again in advance of my stay I received the barrage of emails one of which was from the hotel manager 🤷‍♀️to pre pay ,confirm pool bookings etc all of which I did ! I did make a small request of arriving one hour earlier than due checkin on June 3rd asking for a quiet room ! I was tired and had a bit of a drive,Omg what a very disappointing stay....arrived nobody at the desk for advance check in , went to reception, met with a “non national my colleague will deal with you over there” ok I smiled through my mask and politely said thank you, after three check ins  a one hour wait in the foyer and several apologies ,I’m new I only started last week and I need your credit card to swipe ! Eh why do you need to swipe my card when I’ve already paid in advance, I was obliged to cancel the first of my pool visits as it was too late and the only slot I could get and I wasn’t ready,I will note that there was an lady I think her name was Natalie who apologized for the level of ineptitude demonstrated at reception with her less experienced colleagues however I found the level of rudeness and lack of training fell very short of a quality assured experience on a meet and greet basis and that is down to bad management! Identify the training  needs and meet them prior to requirement ! Shoving people with bad English and lack of training  front of house is deplorable and I watched this for a full hour people were tired upon arrival and very frustrated ! I’m in training and education and quality assurance ....it was so poor and particularly given it was the beginning of opening up! The room wasn’t great , damp stains on the lamps , stained carpets, peeling paint on the ceiling , all issues that could have been dealt with during lockdown ! The pool was well managed you stay in your own section small but adequate , it was relaxing. The quite room I waited to acquire fell very shot of that, it was like Houston Station the noise was horrendous ! If you get a room on the third floor , forget it......504 isn’t quiet and I waited for this for an hour ! I was told housekeeping hadn’t completed the task of cleaning so I’d have to wait! Singing in front of the hotel in the early hours ,lifts , doors banging etc it was party central ! The room wasn’t serviced during our stay , we did get a rap on the door at 7pm on the second day to ask is we wanted towels but it was a little late as I’d already sought that one out earlier, I suggest a little more attention in the area of more disposable cups ,coffee ,milk etc in the service tray if room cleaning is not to be done daily for people staying  longer than one night! I use this hotel  as I attend the Hermitage clinic regularly but on this occasion it fell very very short of encouraging further business, the little things make the difference !!!! 👎👎👎Training in the area of a warm and friendly welcome , good service and value for money is paramount and particularly in current climate !!!!!! ",1,2021,06,05
249,Very bad experience,Very disappointed got told we were getting moved rooms due to us being surrounded by families and then before we moved a male manager stormed into a room of 7 girls very aggressive and instructed us to leave,1,2021,06,03
249,Coffee,"Needed my daily dose of caffeine and the Starbucks queue was far too long, so decided to see if I could grab a coffee out of the hotel, and I was pleasantly surprised. I have popped in frequently over the past 3 weeks and the Clayton is my new coffee spot. The likes of Ina, Patrycja, Sarah, Cheri and Adam are a credit to the hotel. They’re always extremely polite and always willing to have a chat.",5,2021,06,03
249,What does a 4-star hotel look like?,"The title to my review asks a question to which my answer is  'Not the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley!'

Now, to present a defense on the Hotel's behalf, my visit was during the level-5 COVID regime prevailing in the RoI. However, that, in my mind, should have challenged the hotel management and staff, and spurred them on to higher and better levels of customer service. Sadly, that did not appear to be the case.

On arrival at the hotel, the only visible advice on COVID requirements was two A4 poster stands at the front door, with similar dotted throughout the hotel advising that masks should be worn etc. At no time, either at check-in or in the room was there any additional information given or made available on what protocols were in place for residents. Had there been such, then an embarrassing incident which involved me being abruptly chastised by a manager (whom I later came to know as Andrejz (or something like that!)) that I wasn't permitted to drink alcoholic beverages in the casual seating areas, because if the Guarda were to visit they (the hotel) would be in trouble. During my stay, some 4 days, I never once saw a Garda presence!

The lack of information extended to the room, where there was no hotel information anywhere! I have become used to when staying at well-known hotel chains and even 5-star hotels to have important hotel and location information available in the room to peruse; but not at the Clayton! The only information available was a small info-post stuck on the mirror advising that Guest Services and In-Room Dining are now available online. However, these required a QR reader app to access; something that I do not have on my phone!

Room decor (we stayed in Room 302) is dated and entertainment options on the TV are limited and difficult to access - I couldn't access Netflix which was one of 4 options apparently available. On at least 5 to 6 occasions I was informed on the TV that it needed to update the software - why? This should be a centrally managed thing, not a guest-driven thing!

In-room refreshment provision was very poor with only instant coffee available and waxed disposable cups (two) available, which were not refreshed at any time during my stay! I can get this level of service in Travelodge or Premier Inn anytime!

At no time over a four-day, three-night stay was my room refreshed! 4-star? I think not. Again, the well-known hotel brands refresh your room every day!

The main restaurant was closed, apparently because of COVID, but it could be used for breakfast? The main place for food was The Globe, which doubled up as a bar and a restaurant. The menu was really limited and only changed daily with the inclusion of 2 Chef' specials! The food generally was very good, but certainly not 4-star standard, although my last meal, the garlic & thyme marinated chicken supreme, with pan gravy, gratin potatoes and a bouquet of vegetables, was certainly 4-star level cuisine! Many of the staff I encountered seemed to have little knowledge of what makes for good customer service. Indeed, they mostly just wanted a quick 'in and out' and seemed not to have any further knowledge about what was on offer apart from what was written down on the menu. On one night I asked if with my meal I could have 
 a side order of garlic fries to be informed that 'we don't do garlic fries!' No offer to ask the kitchen whatsoever! Added to that was the lack of slice with my G&T, which I had to ask for! Very poor in my view. 

Now for the upside; yes there is an upside, and that takes the form of several members of staff who were friendly, professional, and yet friendly.

The first member of staff to engage with me was Sharon, the HR Manager, whom I encountered several times over my stay. Also, another Sharon, who was part of the breakfast service and with whom I had several good chats. Also worthy of mention is Lili, in the Globe Restaurant, and Pawel on reception.

Would I stay there again. Yes, I would but only if it was convenient and I had no other options. Perhaps you will enjoy it better, and if so please write a glowing report! As for me and sadly, this hotel didn't look like any 4-star hotel I have stayed in!",3,2021,04,30
249,"during covid times with hotels been essential, this hotel has ticked all the boxes","Highly recommend this hotel as it  has all the procedures in place to run a hotel during these times,  staff very friendly.  had to submit letter on arrival to prove I was an essential worker.  ate from the restaurant ,  highly recommand the food.  Thank you Simon and Pawel .  ",5,2021,04,21
249,Outrageous ,"I have never EVER been more disgusted in my life , this hotel is , scruffy , poorly designed and overall chaotic .Never in my life did I think I would have to stay somewhere like this, the bathrooms smelt poorly and were overall unheigienic, the room was cold and eerie, couldn’t get any sleep as the rooms on our floor were so noisy and irritating, have been here once before and wasn’t too impressed either , I’m very disappointed and upset by my stay , 

Kind Regards, Emma",1,2021,03,21
249,Hotel Stay Feb 2021,"Great stay at the Clayton Hotel once again. Easy check in, rooms in excellent condition, good wifi and a delicious breakfast. Special thanks to Pawel, Michael and Helen for their hospitality. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,02,15
249,Thank you,"Great hotel to stay at. Lovely service and friendly staff. Staff were always very helpful to any requests and I had a very nice breakfast. Special thanks to Helen, Michael and Pawel who went above and beyond.",5,2021,02,15
249,Essential work,Have been staying at the hotel for a while now as I have been working in the area. The breakfast is lovely and the staff serving it are very accommodating. I take a breakfast away with me and Sharon always has it ready for us when needed. Ivo aswell is very helpful when working in the restaurant or on breakfast. Definitely would stay again,5,2021,02,02
249,Breakfast Experience,All staff are great and helpful in my stay here while working away from home but in particular Ivo and Sharon when packing the takeaway breakfasts in the morning for us. The service in the evening in the Globe bar is also first class as well!,5,2021,02,02
249,Globe Bar Experience,I was here on the 10th of December for my friend's birthday and though the food was mediocre (as is expected) I found that the staff were really rather lovely! Cristina (she was blonde and had an immaculate fishtail braid at the time) was so affable and amiable that it made up for the food. I really appreciated her warm demeanour and kind advice as we were ordering. I truly hope the hotel rewards her for great customer service,4,2021,01,02
249,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for a night mid december. Hotel was lovely, young man with dark hair on reception was very professional. We did have to Q for about an hour for check in. There was a blonde lady on staff that I presume was in management of some sort, I understand she may have been busy but her manner was awful. Slamming phones in front of us and walking around really angry, didnt get a nice vibe from her. Also checking out the next day a tall guy checked us out and wasnt very friendly at all. Apart from that the hotel is lovely, the food was gorgeous and it is clean and tidy.",4,2020,12,21
249,Great Staff,"Stayed a night here on the 19th Dec to mark my birthday and thoroughly enjoyed my stay! It was very busy checking in, but our experience was still pleasant. We were checked in by Eoghan, who looked after us in a lovely manner and was very efficient. We were also lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the apartment suites which was a lovely surprise. We enjoyed a lovely dinner and drinks that evening in the restaurant. At breakfast the next morning we were well looked after by waiter Oisín, nothing we asked for was any bother. Overall, I was well impressed by the staff at this hotel, all very efficient and pleasant, and wouldn't pass you by without a smile or a hello even though it seemed to be a busy weekend. Clearly all very well trained.",4,2020,12,20
249,Nice family staycation,"Myself, husband  and 2 children visited the hotel a couple of weeks ago and were really impressed by the the new procedures put in place since our last stay. Everything was so much easier as all breakfast, swim times etc were pre booked so very little waiting around. 
The new family bedrooms are so spacious and really nice. The huge Christmas tree in the lobby is also nice for a pic. We look forward to returning next year.",5,2020,12,17
249,"Great staff, highly recommended","We arrived in Dublin for a family funeral. I have to say that the staff in the Clayton Liffey Valley are an absolute credit. They were friendly, welcoming and really went out of their way to ensure guest comfort. The hotel is spotless. The bedrooms are absolutely the cleanest you will see. We had dinner and breakfast, both were delicious. I would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay here again. Well done Clayton Liffey Valley.",5,2020,12,17
249,Lovely hotel but reception totally not Covid compliant,"I have stayed here many times it’s a lovely hotel . But this was my first stay during Covid. The bar/restaurant were totally compliant in that they wore masks at all times. A group of lads came in that looked like they stay there for work. They were not wearing masks and looked very comfortable not wearing masks. It didn’t look like they were asked to wear masks around the hotel. 
Reception however was a different story. Both receptionists were non compliant. One, a lady wore her mask under her nose and the other a man wore none at all. The people checking in not one of them wore a mask and clearly were not asked to. We had checked in earlier in the day and the man who checked us in was totally compliant. But as someone who has older people that I look after I was shocked at what I saw. Even though this is a hotel I have used many times I will never stay here again. ",4,2020,12,14
249,review,"hotel was lovely, ivo our server at breakfast time was very helpful and nice.

i would like though to have guests who enter any public area, be it, reception and dining to be reminded to wear masks. it was uncomfortable to have people walking around you not wearing masks.",4,2020,12,14
249,Great stay at the Clayton Liffey Valley,"My girlfriend and myself stayed in the Clayton liffey valley. We are frontline workers and got a discount on our stay. We wanted a stress free, relaxing night away and we got just that. Hotel room was comfortable. We had a lovely meal and the service was fantastic. Patricia was our waitress. She was very friendly and helpful which made the experience all the better. I would recommend.",5,2020,12,13
249,Girls Trip,Had a lovely stay with the girls. Mulled wine & cookies on check in. Eoghan on reception was very helpful & efficient when checking us in. Will definitely be back again. Daniel was very attentive while serving us dinner. Lovely staff ,5,2020,12,13
249,Think on you're residents first.,"Stayed at this hotel 14th December, traveled most of the day 3hr 24 min drive but had business to attend to first so didn't get there to 8.50pm.
We had rang to book a table knowing that covid altered bookings, but after being on hold for 10 mins they told us there was a table for 2 only to then say no sorry we are fully booked.

As we were residents we believe we should hace been asked if we would like to book a table at the booking stage or by telephone by the hotel.
Instead we had to download an app an put into it what we would like for dinner get an email to say when it was ready & pay for it, then go downstairs to collect it.

As we understand the risk ofcovid we found this to be a bit ridiculous. A simple call to reception & a collection was surley enough.They had even got about 8 people sitting in another restaurant which was closed  to everyone else,maybe an idea to feed you're residents there! 

Apart from a long tiring drive and being very hungry the food was beautiful as was the room & the hotel, just please get a different way for residents to get its not nice to feel you've been brushed aside!",2,2020,12,12
249,Highly recommended ,"Very happy with our experience in the hotel. Bar food was delicious and we were looked after by Patrycja who was very friendly and accommodating for the whole meal. I would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone. Affordable, clean, friendly staff and a great location. Can’t ask for more! ",5,2020,12,11
249,Lovely stay,"Hotel is a lovely place to stay. Staff were all extremely helpful. Had dinner with a group of friends, our waitress Patrycja was very attentive and friendly, lovely to deal with but not overbearing. No request outside the normal menu was too much, if it could be done they would do it. Would definitely come back again.",5,2020,12,11
249,Birthday party,"Had a lovely dinner party, Patricia was looking after us very nice and lovely food would defo come back again, hopefully after covid ☺️

249,Clarion Hotel,"Breakfast at the clarion hotel was one of the highlights of my stay, served by the amazing Ivo we were well looked after the whole time. He constantly checked in on us to see if we needed anything and it was much appreciated. 5 stars for Ivo he deserves a raise!!!!",5,2020,12,05
249,Amazing!!!,After lockdown myself and my partner needed a night away to destress! When i arrived the absolutely AMAZING!! Helen from Clayton Hotel welcomed us with the biggest smile (Under her Mask of course) the best banter and just made us feel so so good and welcome! Customer service was 20 out of 10!! Highly recommend the Clayton! Thanks so much Helen! After a tough lockdown you made us feel a million Dollors!! 💯,5,2020,12,04
249,An essential stay in during lockdown,"It's great that Clayton's is operating during these difficult times, as I needed to relocate to Dublin and although there was a slight reduction in normal services (the leisure centre for example understandably is closed) other services are completely as normal. Such as food service. Evening meals were truly delicious, as are breakfasts, with some specials on offer and changed daily. I found the very friendly and eager-to-help Sharon will ensure you have everything you want and need served with a happy attitude. Breakfast was served very responsibly where staff ensured a physical and safe distance between diners but delivering great service-ask Tara nicely and she may see you off with a takeaway coffee!  Friendly reception staff too which always helps. Happy with the service.",4,2020,12,01

The kids loved the swimming pool.

249,Overnight Break,"My partner and I booked the Clayton Hotel for an overnight stay on the 12th October. As frontline staff we availed of the frontline discount offer and we were met at reception by the lovely Deborah who made us feel so welcome.

249,What even was that!,"This is the 3rd and most definitely the last time i will ever stay here. We booked a suite (548) 
This is the “king” bed IN A 4* HOTEL...are you actually serious!! The springs popping out of it and a big dip in the yellow stained side! We slept on the sofa bed because I would rather not have caught what ever diseases were on this sad excuse of a bed . 

Breakfast : we were in a queue for 15 mins before been seated . While waiting a further 25 mins before we were even approached by a server who was a room assistant wearing accommodation uniform while serving breakfast..( so cleaning dirty rooms and serving food in the same clothes) do you even realise what Covid is? . Got served and waited a further 20 mins for breakfast..

Absolutely disgusting!!",1,2020,09,13
249,Mr,"Great hotel! Friendly staff and management. Great rooms very clean and family friendly. Good food and really close to Liffey valley mall. 

I especially would like to thank Dara (management) for her amazing dedication and friendliness.

To the rest of the staff at the Clayton liffey valley, thank you very much for everything. Friendly service allround. 

Last but not least, thank you to all the cleaning staff, and a special shout out to Maria and Constant.",5,2020,09,13
249,Amazing visit!,"Me & my family (group of 11 in total) stayed in the hotel from Wed 26th to Fri 28th August on a mini family stacation & we couldn't of had a better experience from the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out.. we dined in the hotel restaurant on both nights 5 adults & 6 kids & everyone's food was delicious the menu suited everyone even 1 of our group who has many food intolerances & allergies was catered to & happy with her meal. We also had breakfast on both mornings & the selection available brilliant, again something for everyone.. used the swimming pool aswell on 2 occasions which the kids really enjoyed.. all safety & social distancing measures were in place to make everyone feel more relaxed.. we will definitely visit again..

Special mention to the lovely Helena at the front reception whole was a joy to check in & out with.. 😊",5,2020,09,09
249,More communication needed,"We are just back from a 2 night stay in a family executive room to go to Tayto park. Hotel staff were mainly all lovely..
There are things the hotel need to be doing though in these different times.
1)room wasn't ready when we arrived at 3. We were told to go to the bar and have a drink. Staff doen there wouldn't let us in because we didn't have a booking and we weren't eating. She just stood staring at us. There was a table outside the bar so i said can we sit here and have a drink. She said ok-we asked for 2 more chairs to be brought out which she did. There is very little space though to sit so others would have just had to stand around waiting. We had a swimming booking at 3.45 too so were rushing. 

2) when any booking is made a staff member should immediately be making contact advising you need to book breakfast /dinner/swimming. Luckily i had seen a comment on Facebook of someone just back who advised of this.. Well-dinner and swimming anyway. Managed to get the last space for dinner at 6pm. I would not have been happy to have got there n not been able to get eating.. Or for us to take food to the room to sit on beds and eat.
Breakfast we could only get 7am...it was too early for us.. We were away for a bit of a lie in too. We asked and the staff said we could just take a chance in the morning which we did.. The first morning the lady was great and said no problem we could eat in the other bar which was set up too. The second morning - a different staff member was on and basically said we should have booked and they were full.. When we said about the other bar she reluctantly said.. Ok but wasn't very happy about it . Waiting staff were great although on the second day we saw there was a kids breakfast menu with pancakes n nutella on that we hadn't been shown on the 1st day-if we had been told the first morning about this my girls would have definitely had it
 then too.
Dinner was ok..it was the same waitress as earlier on. She didn't know they had peroni on draught.. Suggested bottled sol instead. A drink was knocked over on table and broke in front of my daughter -she picked up the glass with her hand and took away. I had to ask her to take away the cutlery and sodden napkin and replace it otherwise it would have been left. Kids macaroni cheese was bland and had zero taste.. Nuggets and chips were nice but frozen chips.  Kids dinners came out a good 5 minutes after ours
. Burger was a good size but lacked flavour-chips were lovely and homemade - not sure why they are serving different chips 🤷‍♀️. Seafood tagliatelle was lovely and full of fish. 
Rooms were great size but stiflingly hot. No biscuits.. No replacement of teabags etc and no housekeeping done except for replacement of towels despite sign being left on the door. I appreciate different times but again when checking in i think they should be advising of these things.
I've seen someone else comment about the tannoy in the middle of the night out over the carpark. We heard it too.. Both nights we were woken with it bit couldn't make out what was being said.
We phoned and cancelled our swimming session on the Friday because we wouldn't have been back in time but when got down for our 8.45 session we were told it had been cancelled too-they couldn't explain why. We were able to get in the middle of the pool but with no side for my littlest it was quite difficult for me on my own with 2 kids hanging off me at times lol
Overall the hotel was nice and staff were nice but as i say.. We like to be able to sit and have a drink and watch the sports or whatever when we are in a hotel and we weren't able to do any of that. I appreciate we are in different times at the moment but if everything has to be booked they should be double checking all that at check in too. And i don't see why if they are serving food all day one can't just sit in the bar and have a pint or 2.
Also there are no spa facilities either. I'm not sure why when other hotels have their spas back open again? 
Hotel well located and secure. Kids had a ball anyway and that's the main thing",3,2020,08,26
249,Worst dinning experience ever.,"At the Clayton liffy valley at the moment. Sat immediately, left 15 minutes before given a menu 15 minutes later order was taken and now an hour after we where seated we still haven't gotten our food. Other tables sat after us have been fed before us. Staff ignoring every request we have made. Talk about pissed off parents and kids. Would highly recommend not to dine here. Rooms are great very spacious and clean.

Food came eventually and doesn't look the best, must say only kids food came. Parents where still waiting 15 minutes after kids for there's 

Should have stayed at home.",1,2020,08,25
249,Hotel stay,"Lovely Hotel, Staff couldn’t do enough for you. You have to book in for the pool and breakfast. I never booked for breakfast and there was only a 7am slot available- but we said we would take our breakfast to the room but the following morning passing by the breakfast room we asked was there any availability as it looked very empty to allow for social distancing and they were more than happy to accommodate us. Lots of staff helping and they were so friendly and nice and made us feel very relaxed. We had an issue with our room and straight away they had no problem in changing us to another room.  Thank you for a lovely stay. I would highly recommend the Clayton Liffey Valley hotel.",5,2020,08,23
249,Very disappointed,"We stayed as a family of 5 and had inter connecting rooms which were v clean but on the ground floor so over looked the car park. We were in a room by the group area check in door where there was a fire exit that people used to go out smoking or talking on the phone which was just outside our window so very noisey. I did not feel safe at all in those rooms. We weren’t aware we had to prebook breakfast or the pool so when we eventually checked in ( room wasn’t ready) we were told we could only eat breakfast at 7am!!! And no pool slots available. Kids NOT happy, restaurant was booked out too so we had to drive to another one. Breakfast despite being at 7am was very nice and bar lunch was v tastey but v dark and dingey room. The pool staff were lovely and put us on a cancellation list so we got a slot but it was all divided up into squares and you couldn’t even swim as it was too small. All in all a very disappointing experience and we won’t stay again.",2,2020,08,22
249,Breakfast experience and stay in Clayton Liffey Valley,An excellent experience. Breakfast was delicious. Oana and all the staff were friendly and very helpful. We had a repacking stay in the hotel. We were really happy with our superior quadruple room. It was very clean. The sanitation stations in different parts of the entire hotel including the lifts made us feel safe. A very good and well-adapted setting during this risky time. All the staff were wearing face shields or masks. The swimming pool was clean  and the limited number of people in the pool at a time made us feel safe. We will definitely stay again in Clayton Liffey Valley Hotel.,4,2020,08,22
249,A great value break away,"We decided to stay here due to its location just off the M50 & how close it was too restaurants & the Liffeyvalley centre shopping. 
The hotel is beautiful & we felt safe & comfortable in it - especially at breakfast. We where a family of 7 and where put into the overspill restaurant, which was very quiet, very airy , very spaced out.  We had a lady called Susan O’Keeffe look after us & the attention was brilliant, nothing was too much trouble, she returned a few times asking did we need top ups etc, definitely could not have fault this experience, breakfast also arrived plated covered in a silver warmer.
As long as you phone ahead and book in the pool/gym & restaurant, it didn’t feel any different than pre March 2020.",5,2020,08,20
249,quick break with the kids,"Im here at the moment.Huge dissapointment.
no room in the pool.after some haggeling we got in only to find that the pool is set in to grids about  2mts  x 3mts  with floating rope.you cannot leave your pig pen.
its horrendous.in a clorinated pool?????
no space to eat even though half the resturaunt  is empty.and well spaced out.now i have to get a taxi to somewhere.we just wanted to chill.
dont waste your time if you want to relax with kids its awful.
staff are nice and room is clean.
WORST SWIMMING EXPERIENCE EVER",1,2020,08,18

The best breakfast we’ve ever had!! Freshly cooked to order. Excellent quality and choice.  All staff wearing full PPE. Excellent hygiene standards.,5,2020,08,10
249,Clean & Friendly but features of hotel disappoint,"The hotel is great for families in that it is clean and staff are friendly and attentive BUT...thats where it stops

The rooms - way to warm, stiflingly hot not air condition at all. two tall fans were provided but they simply recirculated the already hot air around the room. We did have the window open but our view was out to the N4 to Galway. Terrible night sleep due to the room temperature

The bar - poorly designed with cheap decor. The ambiance was non existent the football was on with no sound, there was no music and social distancing was taken to a new level with spacing being excessive. bar had very expensive drinks cost 12 euro for a glass of cheap proseco. Asked for a pricelist so i didnt get blindsided again when ordering a drink but there was none, no straws for the kids and no lemon lime etc for the G&T.

Pool - due to current legislation the pool wasn't exactly swimming pool more or a floating area with our family being restricted to a 4x2m section of water to 'float' in.

Food - we were somewhat forced to eat in the hotel if we wanted to relax in the bar area, food was a burger which was very nice but the menu was shockingly limited to 5 items which whilst nice resembled pub food rather than a hotel restaurant. We dined at 8pm and service was still veyr slow for being half empty.

All in the hotel was obviously impacted by covid19 which they cant be put down for as they did provide excellent sanitizing stations all over the hotel but with bar restrictions you were almost confined to your room. Even with no restrictions the bar wouldn't excite you much and were you are located is a little out from the town. Being stuck in the room was the killer due to the heat - there seems to be a ventilation system but it wasnt on and there was no thermostat.

Hotel is ideal for a pit stop or before airport etc as location is perfect to N4 / M50 but i personally will pay a little more and stay more central next time for atmosphere and hopefully cooler night sleep",3,2020,08,10
249,Amazing family suite & breakfast staff,"Booked the family in for our annual trip to tayto park,stayed here last year & have to say everything was excellent...
On arrival after tayto park Tues evening we were delighted to get a family suite,
Huge spacious suite which was prefect space for our 3 young children,
Unfortunately could not secure a table for dinner but 'click n collect' option available & eat in the room...
Ordered food & was told to collect at 21.10,
Was not ready until 21.35 but the hotel was really busy & its a new system..
Food was really nice,fish n chips,calamari,curry & caeser salad...

Following morning for breakfast I cannot speak highly enough of the staff,
2 large families is tough to cater for but the bar was opened to accommodate us by the girl at the desk,
The serving staff were so good with the kids & with breakie to order now its tough on them but top class service...
They really could not do enough for us...
Thats our families second stay at the hotel & will deffo go back again...

Liffey valley suites were a real nice treat for us so thank you Clayton Liffey Valley for a fantastic stay again in these challenging times for hotels & staff...

249,Highly recommend! Great Job guys👏🏻,"Stayed here all through lockdown on business and the staff couldn't have been more pleasant under the circumstances. 
It's great to see some life back in the place again. Helen, Tammy, Ciara and Deborah on reception will look after you extremely well and the rest of the staff are working tirelessly to make the hotel a safe environment while still managing to maintain that holiday atmosphere. 
Well done guys! Keep up the good work and I'll see you again in a few weeks.",5,2020,08,04
249,"Disturbed sleep, too warm & security sounds in middle of night","Stayed here with my family for 2 nights last week. We were lucky and were 2nd in queue to check in. There was about 10/15 people behind us. If you can, check in online as staff always seem really busy. We had a family executive room with 2 separate bedrooms with balcony & kitchenette in kids room. The balcony was overlooking a Toyota sales showroom & a view of The liffey valley shopping centre in distance.(room 551) It was lovely and big, kids were loving the balcony and not having to share a room with us. We had 2 tables but no chairs so we had to request them. It was extremley warm in the room so we opened some windows and left to have a swim. Once there the receptionist had no knowledge of our booking and seemed very confused. Once I told her we booked over the phone a day previous and spoke to someone she let us in. (We had to buy 4 swimming caps 3euros each so bring your own if you have any) Obviously with the ongoing covid-19 precautions we were aware things would be slightly different but we wernt aware we would only get an 8th of the pool to ourselves (ropes separating us from other families). We all love swimming so that was abit of a disappointment. When back in our room we got washed & changed for dinner in The globe restaurant (included in our booking) We all really enjoyed our meals, they were delicious. We especially enjoyed the bruschetta. No tables in seating/bar area to have a drink so we went straight up to our room which was still very warm even though windows were open. Played some games with the kids and went to bed. After a few hours sleeping my son came into us saying he couldnt sleep as a loud speaker/tannoy was sounding telling people to leave the premises. He thought out hotel was on fire or something. Anyway after telling him it may have been a dream it sounded again and I heard it. I went and slept with him and said if it sounded again I would go to reception and ask what it was. It did 2 or 3 times and we both didnt sleep for the rest of the night. He didnt want me to leave the room and he didnt want to leave with me. At breakfast I asked the waiter about it and he wasnt aware of anything and seemed confused so after breakfast I went and asked about it at reception. The receptionist just kept looking at her screen to see if anything was reported. She  also seemed v confused and couldnt explain what it may have been. She apologized and assured me she would look into it. We never did get an explanation and it happened both nights we were staying!@! My son was so tired the 2nd day he he slept on and missed breakfast. Disturbed sleep for 2 nights with 2 kids and one v.frightened & anxious 8 year old is not good. We have came to the conclusion it was one of the cars show room alarms outside our hotel. If you can, request a room overlooking hotel carpark at the opposite side of hotel room 551 as you dont want to be woken at all hours with loud security alarms. Other guests must have been disturbed & complained, I'm sure it just wasnt us.",3,2020,08,02
249,Family trip,"This was our second time to visit this lovely family friendly hotel. I was a little nervous about travelling due to Covid19 but my daughter had an appointment in Crumlin's children hospital so we had to travel. Table service for the breakfast was excellent, the staff were very helpful and always wearing their PPE. You had to book a 45min slot for the swimming pool but it was very well organised and my children had a great time. A special mention for Susan who was very friendly to my twin girls at breakfast time. 
My only complaint was that the rooms were absolutely roasting and you couldn't open the windows due to the noise from the road outside but overall a lovely stay and we would stay again!",4,2020,07,15
249,Short stay,"Booked into the hotel and found reception and restaurant staff  very helpful, table service for breakfast was excellent. Covid 19 regulations were very good. Had a lovely stay and will definitely return.",4,2020,07,15
249,Liffeyvalley,Under current circumstances I thought the staff played a blinder .so friendly and helpful day and night.would like a more varied menu from lunch to dinner but other than that couldn't fault our stay. Great location for various day trips and shopping. Overall we enjoyed our stay immensely.,4,2020,07,11
249,Brilliant hotel,Lovely hotel and brilliant for families. Handy to liffey valley shopping centre and restaurants. Also a special mention to staff member Deborah who helped me out with getting my baby and her essentials sorted,5,2020,07,08
249,Fantastic family hotel,Recent stay here with my wife and child and it was a fantastic stay. Leisure club and pool was open with simple COVID procedures in place. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was amazing we’ll be back soon thank you to all the staff,5,2020,07,02
249,Awesome stay at this hotel ... Greatly appreciated !!!,"I recently came to Ireland on business from the USA, but had to go into a 14 day Quarantine before being allowed to visit the company campus. While staying at this hotel, I was treated as if I was family. Deborah, One of the hotel staff that works the Reception Desk, really went above and beyond to make my stay a pleasant experience. Not to mention that the lunch and dinner served by the Hotel Restaurant was really delicious. If I ever have to return to Ireland, I'm definitely making it a point to return back to the Clayton Hotel.",5,2020,07,01
249,"Great overnight stay, will go again soon.","We went as a family of four, 3 year old and 8 month old. We had a great stay. We stayed in the executive suite. It was spotless, the sofa bed was comfy for 3 year old and travel cot was perfect for baby. We had a microwave, fridge and toaster so had supper in the room for kids. So handy. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We went to our swimming booking and the water was really warm. I didn't bring baby as thought may be too cool for evening time but she would have been fine. It was lovely. All of the signs were very clear and plenty of sanitizer everywhere. The breakfast was beautiful and the blonde lady in the restaurant for breakfast went above and beyond for us and made us feel so welcome. The location is perfect, very close drive to zoo and the shopping centres. We will go again in August and stay in the same room.
We read previous reviews and saw that staff were to be amazing and they really were. Very nice people to talk to and they just really wanted us to enjoy our stay. Welldone to them all, during such weird times.",5,2020,06,30
249,Thank you,"Just a quick mention to Tami for being so kind to my mother in law when she was in Dublin. Thank you for your help and hospitality. Much appreciated. 
Clayton hotel is always a great meeting place with friends.",5,2020,06,17
249,Work Stay Due To Covid 19,I recently spent 8 weeks here because I work in healthcare and because I live with my elderly parents I was unable to go home. While it was challenging and lonely at times I have to say I couldn’t have picked a better place to stay in. The staff are warm and friendly and always very helpful especially Pawel who was there to check me in on the first day check me out 8 weeks later and for everything in between. I had everything I needed from great WiFi a fridge and clean towels/linen right outside my door I didn’t have to request anything because it was always provided. So a massive thank you to Pawel and the rest of the staff at the Clayton Hotel I know it can’t have been easy welcoming guests during this pandemic but you do it so well.,5,2020,06,08
249,Excellent Customer Service,Both timesnwe stayed in the Clayton we met Helen at Reception. She went out of our way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. She was warm and friendly and couldn't have done more for us. A great addition to your team at the Clayton. The rooms we stayed in were excellent and we were able to work comfortable from them in the evening. The coffee in the morning at the barista was also a great treat. Thanks very much to Helen and the team in the Clayton for making our essential work journey easier. We will be back. ,5,2020,05,13
249,Customer Service,"As an essential workers I am out on the road a bit. I had booked into the Clayton. It was a pleasure to meet Helen at reception. She was warm, friendly and welcoming in this very strange time. We had excellent coffee the next day at the barista station.",5,2020,05,11
249,Romantic hot stay,"I stayed here in feb 2020, staff in the Globe resturant was very helpful, well mannered and well experienced. Ina, Cheri, Chloe, Sarah, Anthony and William went above and beyond to make stay more enjoyable.",5,2020,03,14
249,Good location and great gym,"The hotel is basic enough everything you need.  Beds are comfortable. 
Rooms are as expect for a budget type hotel nothing spectacular but clean. Breakfast was good, its self service and had a selection of everything. Had dinner in the bar on one night and food was good.  There is a hidden charge of €6 per night for parking. Great big by gym with everything you need in it.  Was here during the coronavirus issue was very disappointed with the lack of signage and no hand sanitizer compared to other hotels.  Felt like they really weren't worried about guests.",3,2020,03,14
249,Very enjoyable stay,"Spent two nights there last week and really enjoyed it. Good rooms, good breakfast.

The main reason for my excellent rating was one of the staff there. A lady on reception called Helen. A really nice person who had a lovely smile every time we passed by reception.

On the day of checkout as I went to checkout there was some guy having a meltdown and being very abusive to her. She kept her cool, called a manager to assist yer man and promptly greeted us with the usual smile.

Helen you are a legend. Thank you. ",5,2020,03,12
249,Mr. Efren Miranda,I am regular customer in their restaurant for my breakfast and I can say that the breakfast is delicious and healthy. The customer service is excellent . Manager Ivo and Staff Sharon are both very good to all my need in thier restaurant. I can tell that all staff I encountered have positive attitudes!,5,2020,03,11
249,Family weekend away,"Great weekend away here at the Clayton, lovely staff special thanks to Chloe. Rachel and also Christopher in the restaurant who are lovely friendly staff always a smile despite it being busy, 
Reception staff are very pleasant. Rooms are lovely and clean 
We ate in the hotel bar/ restaurant and also Gustos.
Restaurant food is big portions and kids menu is so good and reasonable priced. the cheese/melon starter is a great healthy option. 
Gusto was great the Buffet style Main course, loads of selection and freshly made pizzas. and an ice cream cart. 
Only little downfall was breakfast, Buffet was not topped up , people were waiting on sausages etc. and also the pool was unavailable for the weekends, we did not know this on booking,
we will be back , as its ideal for kids. thanks you all",5,2020,03,08
249,50th party ,We attended a 50th birthday party last night have to stay it was a brilliant night over 150 people and only four staff on the night did not stop for a min always there to help and was on hand if we needed anything especially Daniel he was everywhere working in bar then making sure everything was ok on the floor when he had the time bar was busy but never under pressure fantastic job from Daniel and the other three girls I didn't get there names thanks for a great night brilliant job guys ,5,2020,03,08

Amazing, helpful  and  keen to please  staff  members.  Very  convenient  location the views  are  lovely. Highly  recommended  this  hotel.",5,2020,03,08
249,Great stay,Staff were amazing so friendly and helpful. Rooms were good bed amazingly comfortable.plenty of selection at breakfast. Very little on for kids over midterm as cinema broken. Overall an enjoyable few days staying there.,4,2020,03,06
249,Pool Closure ,"I'm current staying in the hotel which is very comfortable. I'm on business which I do almost on a weekly basis. I checked the hotel for amenities & booked through my usual provider. Just returned from a well earned run, then time for a dip in the pool only to be told at the pool that is is closed until 13th March. At no point on the hotels website does it mention the closure, when I checked in there was no mention of the closure, the only reason I booked this hotel was for the use of the pool.

Not good enough Clayton Liffey Valley.

",1,2020,03,02
249,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here with my girlfriend and had a great time, check in was fast and easy and the receptionist was lovely! We dined in the bar and the food was lovely, the steak was cooked perfectly and my girlfriend said she loved the Curry! The staff there are a credit to the place too as Adam and Anthony were very helpful all night and had us both laughing all night, two very lovely young lads. Will definitely be back for another getaway!",5,2020,03,02
249,Poor service as pool shut with no advance warning,Very disappointed as booked this hotel purely for the use of the swimming pool . It is now shut for refurbishment with signs going up the day before !!! This SHOULD have been on the hotel website in advance of the works to give guests the choice to stay here or NOT . We would have definitely stayed at another hotel . Not good enough.,1,2020,03,01
249,Very noise and busy,"We checked in to room 302 and was so noisy could hear everything doors slamming ,people talking and from rooms above . Its seamed like a business hotel . We were at breakfast at 630 am and was cold and staff no help  also breakfast chef touching food with hands no gloves ect . Wouldn't stay again",2,2020,02,25
249,Nice Visit,"We had a nice visit to the Clayton, it is a very busy hotel and child friendly. The gym and pool were great - very busy but nice. The lady on reception could have been a bit more friendlier - she was a supervisor also! The rooms were nice, we were in a room that shared onto others which made it quite noisy at night time.",3,2020,02,22
249,Monaghan,Stayed here for a week for work was a fantastic experience all round. A lady called Sharon made this experience all that much better through the help we received from her expecially at breakfast was mostly appreciated and would strongly recommend lovely staff,5,2020,02,21
249,"personable, reliable and commitment like never seen before","I work out of your hotel quite often and I have to say your teams are so personable and reliable I would actually consider staying here for a night away from the kids (the only reason I wouldn't is that I live literally 10 mins away just past maynooth) I recommend your hotel to everyone I meet when I tell them that I work out of here. 

The people I interact with are so professional yet they still maintain a real genuine approach with not just me but with any client they meet - something that you don't see often nowadays - well done, Adrian, Coco, the 2 Sharon' and Lily as well as Ciaran who always stops for a chat to see how everything is  - and Ian has filled the role as Barista well wit a good teacher on side in Jess. you just have to look at the range of the people I've mentioned across the team that it runs in their veins rather than just being a job - well done Dalata and team for having such a special team in Liffey Valley",5,2020,02,20
249,Hotel review,"Highly recommend this hotel. Friendly and staff very helpful. Room spacious and spotless. Fab breakfast and such great variety. Great entailment in bar area. Front desk staff so polite. 
Thanks for enjoyable stay",5,2020,02,18
249,Good value,"For the price, hard to beat. Room spacious and comfortable, and staff on the whole friendly and helpful (bar staff could make more of an effort). Two major downsides though would have to be the room connected to another and separated only by a door (really a separate room?) and the fairly expensive car parking.. no call for this! ",3,2020,02,17
249,Valentines stay,"Our stay in this hotel was, in one word, lovely. The rooms were basic yet effective. Beds were comfy and the rooms in their entirety were spotless. The hotel staff were fine. We tried the ‘globe’ restaurant during our stay. The food here was gorgeous, I particularly recommend the fish and chips! The restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is only a 5-10 minute walk from the big Liffey valley shopping centre, which is perfect if you’re looking for some retail therapy, some places to eat or a movie date. I would definitely recommend this hotel and for the price you cannot go wrong.",4,2020,02,16
249,Lovely staff,"Visited this hotel for a concert in Dublin and stayed one night,the reception on check in was first class a really lovely guy and the room was clean and really roomy.Breakfast the next morning was delicious and the whole stay was great value for money too.",5,2020,02,15
249,Only Arrived and I believe I'm in for a lovely stay,"Just greeted and checked in by a wonderful man by the name of Powel. He gave myself and the future wife a few laughs and lots of information about activities in the hotel, couldn't have been any nicer. Our trip is off to a great start. 
Thank you Powel",5,2020,02,14
249,Great service,"Location suited us so stayed one night. Had food at the bar which was very tasty and we had great service from Andrew in particular. Reception were very helpful, Deborah in Liffey Valley and also the receptionist in the Clayton near Bord Gáis who arranged a taxi for us on Saturday night. 

Breakfast queue was a bit of a surprise but didn’t disappoint. Hope the stray cat has found some shelter and thanks to Amanda for agreeing to try and help it. 

Really great service was the hotels standout asset.",4,2020,02,09
249,3night work stay,"Was working in the city centre so this way a bit far out of the way but fine if you’ve got a car. Great gym for a hotel and the pool was nice too. Room was as needed for a few nights at work. Bit noisy from the room
Next door 1 night - the walls didn’t seem very sound proofed at all. Reception staff were lovely as was the man who worked the coffee bar in the morning / cheap enough parking for a hotel too and plenty around to keep busy, cinema, shopping centre and restaurants ",4,2020,02,04
249,not bad at all,"we stayed there on Saturday night, 2 adults with 2 kids. The staff is very nice and will go an extra mile for you!!! We got a good price so did not expect too much, hence no major disappointment. The only thing that blew my mind was, on Sunday for breakfast we had to que for 7 min at 10am to get into the breakfast room, to find out that they only had one toaster that was toasting one side at a time and we were told that morning they had 500+ people for breakfast. One toaster!!!! can they not spare a few bob and buy a second toaster. Otherwise everything else was above the norm that you d expect for the price that we paid. We will come back again.",4,2020,01,27
249,Great family hotel,This was our second stay in Clayton Liffey Valley in a family room with 2 children. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The beds are really comfortable. The corridor was quiet overnight despite the hotel being busy. Great value. My son told the receptionist it was his 5th birthday and he organised for a birthday dessert to be delivered to the room! Made his day! Pool area clean and family friendly. Great location. Easy access to several Dublin family attractions. Great breakfast and fantastic friendly attentive staff. Amanda and Tammy really went out of their way to make a fuss of the birthday boy! We will definitely be back. Thanks to the Clayton Liffey Valley team.,5,2020,01,26
249,Phoenix,Stay in your hotel during the week with my mother because my father was in the hermitage hospital. We had a very nice stay and I would like to mention the lovely lady on reception Deborah who went out of her way to be helpful and especially caring towards my mother. Will definitely return.,5,2020,01,24
249,Ok,"Stayed here. Location is brilliant right beside Liffey Valley shopping centre, however some inconsistencies with staff regarding late checkout and paying/not paying for parking leading to our confusion. Could hear neighbours alarm going off at 6am for about 1 hour - walls quite thin. Limited evening meal menu but lovely food. Long walk to room depending on where your room is!",3,2020,01,21
249,Week end away,"Main reception on arrival was very friendly room nicely presented and clean 
breakfast was good only down fall in hotel was the restraunt/pub food was not a great selection fish and chips was lovely steak was not so nice for 28e left waiting for staff to come and offer us desert menu and more drinks gave up after 30min waiting paid and left wouldn't return to restraunt/pub area to eat again but would return to hotel 
The hot tub didn't work  in pool area",4,2020,01,19
249,Family Break,"A lovely,  clean hotel. Rooms are a nice size, family rooms have 1 double and 2 singles. Breakfast is lovely. On the down side the childrens pool was not open while I was there and this was a big inconvenience so I would ring to check this before you book. Also seem to be alot of people living in the hotel as opposed to holidaying, this changes the ambience.",4,2020,01,17
249,Fantastic location,"I stay in this hotel on a regular basis due to it being close to my office but also for numerous other reasons. The rooms are very modern, the food is excellent and the staff are friendly. Ina behind the bar/restaurant is always very welcoming and pleasant! I have regularly stayed in this hotel and will continue to do so in the future.",5,2020,01,16
249,Good service Globe bar,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago when it was the Clarion and decided to come back again for our anniversary last December. This hotel never fails to disappoint. Everything about our stay was perfect.

The service in Globe bar was our highlight on this occasion. We had drinks in the bar until it closed and not once did the service disappoint. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and made us up a range of cocktails. The prices were very reasonable too which was great to see! 

We will definitely be back to this bar for another nights of drinks soon!",5,2020,01,16
249,The Globe Bar!!!!,Myself and my family recently stayed in the hotel for a Christmas catch up. The room were all lovely and comfortable. We decided to have some food and drinks in the Globe Bar. I have to say the service we received was next to none! The staff were so kind and friendly! I will have to mention a lovely bubbly girls called Rachel who was looking after us- This lady was so attentive to our table and made sure we were well and truly looked after!! The food was amazing also so hats off the the chef! Myself and my family will 100% be returning,5,2020,01,15
249,Globe bar,Visited here with my family after Christmas. We live nearby so weren’t guests of the hotel. We didn’t have a booking either as it was a late decision yet staff were so accommodating and very friendly. Found us a table straight away even though we’ve a big family. The service all night was brilliant. Received our drinks immediately and food very quickly afterwards. The wings and curry were a big hit. Couldn’t fault anything from the service to the food to the atmosphere. Big thanks to the staff for making it special. We definitely will be back again.,5,2020,01,15
249,Bernard,"I use this hotel regularly and always appreciate the warm welcome from friendly staff at reception, who learn your name, and in the dining rooms, clean spacious and comfortable rooms, great leisure center and nice food. Convenient for shopping and cinema",4,2020,01,07
249,Lovely stay in Dublin,"Firstly, hotel is in a great location especially if you are heading to the Bord Gais Theatre which is right beside it. We also found it walking distance from the city centre and many of the attractions you would wish to visit. 

The room was very spacious, quiet and comfortable. The beds were extremely comfy and it was neither too hot or cold. The bathroom was clean and the shower worked well!

We did order room service on the first night and there was a mix up with orders so our food arrived an hour after we ordered but this was given to us complimentary due to the delay so no complaints here! 

Only issue and one which is hard to resolve given how busy the hotel is at weekends - the breakfast foods can be a little cold but on the whole, there was a great selection of both healthy and not so healthy options!

If you are planning to use the pool, bring a swim cap! 

Will definitely be back! :)",4,2020,01,05
249,Best bar staff ever!!!,"Big shout out to all the staff behind the bar, for the best pints ever poured over 2019. Andrei, Andrew, Adam, Anto, Cheri, Ina, Coco, Julia, Sarah, Kevin, William, Chloe, Lili and Rachel. Keep up the awesome work and keep the pints coming. Happy New Year",5,2020,01,04
249,VERY RUDE,More about leisure center. My kids did not know how to swim so I went in and they were just holding on to me in the swimming pool and the staff came out and gave me a dirty look he had brown hair then he came out and goes to me we have cameras for a reason and I was a bit confused because  my kids are 7 and 5 they were not doing any harm so I was just teaching them how to kick there legs so then we got out and I asked if there was any swim lessons for beginners and he was like they are to bad to go lessons and he said u are gonna have to teach them the basics but I was like they will get thought that in beginners will they not he said no no I was like ok and left and he really hurt my children’s feeling to be honest my kids kind of lost confidence and I do not think that’s ok your kid should be full of there self I think it effected the mentality and physical of my kids but I have to say all the staff in the hotel are always great,1,2020,01,04
249,Very noisy,"We stayed in a room with two adjoining rooms that seemed to be having an all nighter, i felt like they were in the room with me. Walls are so thin. 
Comfortable beds. 
Clean. 
Decent breakfast too. 
Would recommend for a short stay if you can deal with noisy neighbors",3,2020,01,03
249,Not Good Avoid,"I have stayed here before but it’s really gone down hill. Very noisy the walls are paper thin. Very limited food options as main restaurant now only open on Saturdays.  OK if only want to stay for one night but not for any longer. It feels tired certainly not a four star experience, maybe a two star at a push",2,2020,01,03
249,Disappointed,"We stayed here for a night over the Xmas period and picked it for the location. The hotel itself is very modern and looks great. The rooms are small but have everything you need for a stay, including iron and board. Check-in was a little lengthy with one man checking in and 4 other staff just standing at the end of the desk?? But have to say we were granted early check-in as the room was ready so we could throw our bags in before heading out...very pleased with that. However....  the down side was a terrible night's sleep...there were two locked adjoining doors so  you can hear the rooms on both sides throughout the night, doors banging, children shouting in the corridor at all hours. There is no air conditioning in the rooms so they are very very warm and uncomfortable for sleeping. But the main complaint is that the TVs don't have a volume limmiter that most other hotels have. The person next to us blared the TV all night and we were unable to sleep! This could be so easily rectified. Having paid for a nights sleep and not getting one we left tired and disappointed. I wouldn't stay again!",2,2020,01,03
249,Nice hotel and good food,"Room was a nice size, clean and warm. It is a long walk from the room to the reception. Staff were friendly. Food in the restaurant was really nice. Steak and chicken curry were the nicest we have had!! ",4,2020,01,02
249,Ciara,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend, I had a very nice experience there and I would like to say the reception staff were very friendly especially Deborah who was very helpful throughout our stay. I will definitely return",5,2019,12,31
249,Dublin break,"A 1st stay at the Clayton Liffey Valley was a pleasant experience. Check in was efficient and room was as requested high floor. The room was clean and bigger expected. The king size bed was very comfortable. The shower over bath is not ideal. I would prefer a stand alone shower. The toiletries supplied were minimal for 2persons. We didn't have breakfast in hotel. We did have ""dinner"" on one evening but this proved to be a bad decision. Italian buffet style... however the main course was the only part of buffet self service. Starter & dessert were served to table and no choice available. Food was the usual buffet ...luke warm and pretty tasteless. And all for 50 Euro. Most staff were pleasant. A return visit is unlikely because of the food experience. Otherwise  it would be a possibility.",3,2019,12,31
249,Not great stay,Stayed here two weeks ago had a lovely stay stayed again on Saturday the room was very cold turned up the heat to try to put heat into the room  later went down to the bar tables busy but nobody seemed to be clearing off all the emptys that had built up and not many staff on was enjoying having a drink but as evening went by children left unattended running wild through the gap beside the fireplace screaming and being generally abandoned by who owned them no problem with children normally but it was after 11pm it was very high pitched screaming and chasing around the bar staff did not do anything to stop it later back at the room heat was not good in the room for the time of year and with staying previously the room and hotel was a lot warmer,3,2019,12,30
249,Great hotel,"We stayed here in December and had a great time, the rooms were lovely and spacious and the location was brilliant. We used the pool and it was lovely and all the staff were so helpful and friendly at all times.",5,2019,12,29
249,bar service,"Don't typically write reviews but felt compelled to based on the service I received in the Globe Bar. Stayed over the weekend with my wife and 2 young kids and the barman Cheri  was very kind and made my daughters two delicious strawberry dacquiris (non alcoholic of course :)) . Our waitress Sarah was very helpful and answered all our queries regarding allergens (as our daughter has a severe nut allergy), she was very kind a credit to your hotel.",5,2019,12,28
249,Amazing !!,Hello my name is Courtney and I am a member of staff from the Maldron and newlands cross I booked in here last week with my partner for 2 nights let’s just say was great especially right before Christmas when I checked in I was looked after very very well by pawel front office manger I think he was so so kind and very polite and had gave up one of the apartments which I was not expecting the room was out of the world and I was gobsmacked when I entered it but unfortunately the room was really cold as the heaters did not work but when I had mentioned it they had gave me up plug in heaters which really help a lot ! Myself and my partner enjoyed our stay it was very comfortable and a lot of space thanks to pawel who had made our stay that little bit more special he made us feel at home so please mention it to him from me that I say thank you and I really enjoyed it and that he inspired me with his communion and professionalism skills that I will try to carry out myself back at my hotel I will be sure to let my HR no how my stay went and I wish you the very best will definitely be booking with you again soon !!,5,2019,12,27
249,Nice stay,"Hotel was really nice.
The room was excellent where the TV was entertaining, and the room was well equipped and had a Fridge too.
Also the location of the hotel was good as it was close to liffey Valley shopping centre.",5,2019,12,23
249,Birthday Celebration,"2 days ago I celebrated my mother and Godmother's  birthday in the globe restaurant & bar function room. Kevin gave us a warm welcome and performed exceptional service.  From my friends and family we greatly appreciate how you looked after us kevin and a massive thank you! Will return again next year,

Samu.",5,2019,12,22
249,Mothers Birthday,Today my best friend and myself brought our mothers for a birthday celebration. Kevin looked after us. As the restaurant wasn’t open he seated us in a private area he opened himself. He was exceptional in every regard. Constantly looking after us and checking up on us. We’d a brilliant day and it was in large part due to his excellent people skills and caring personality. I hope you’ve a good Christmas Kev! You’re a top top bloke.,5,2019,12,21
249,Business lunch,"Had the most amazing lunch here recently the warm beef salad and curry ate both delicious. The service was excellent (can be tough when on a time) and the 2 Sharon's would lighten any mood.
Will be back over the new year
Happy Christmas to all

249,Super staff,"Chloe and Kevin 
Looked after us so well. The best cocktails in Dublin. Great laugh Superb hotel, lovely rooms, sounds like a plant but it's not. I'd highly recommend a visit

Alan Murphy & Adrian Quirke PI",5,2019,12,17
249,Nice hotel,"Recent stay here was very enjoyable, front desk friendly and helpful. Rooms really spacious and comfortable. Food and beverage was good, breakfast was excellent. Overall atmosphere very good and definitely worth a visit. ",4,2019,12,13
249,Serve the purpose,"First impression was good: reception friendly although I had a late check in. I asked for a quiet room and got offered a family room.
I had a drink at the bar and Guiness was nice. Nice Christmas decorations.
The corridor to room was shabby and felt dirty. Lots of rubbish and stains (see pictures). The state in the room was similar, really in need of proper clean and stains of pillow (see picture) not acceptable. Also scruff marks everywhere and holes in wall (see picture). Bathroom similar impression of being filthy, big pink stain on sink (see picture)
Night was okay. Breakfast was typical, focus on cooked breakfast but liked seeing a toaster specially for gluten free bread.
Overall okay hotel as walking distance to office. But only a choice because it serves a purpose! Best is the friendly staff.",3,2019,12,12
249,Lovely Friendly Staff,"Myself and my friends meet a couple of times a week for coffee in the Globe bar. I find the staff go out of their way to be helpful, especially Coco, Lily and the two Sharon's. The staff are a great asset to the Clayton Hotel.

The Aqua Ladies.",5,2019,12,12
249,Lunch,"Recently stopped in for some lunch when going through Dublin, we were served by two women, both named Sharon!! The food was lovely but the service really topped it off! Will call in again for lunch when in Dublin",5,2019,12,12
249,Excellent service,Had lunch here recently on a work meeting. The atmosphere is lovely and the service from the 2 Sharons was second to none. 2 very friendly and very helpful members of staff. They are an asset to your company and really helped us get into the festive spirit,5,2019,12,12
249,Review,"I met with a few friends for a cactch up and a bit of lunch. The service received was really brilliant. There were two ladies, both Sharon, who were so welcoming and helpful, a credit to the Hotel. They were a pleasure to meet. We all had a lovely time and will be sure to visit again.",5,2019,12,12
249,Credit where credits due,"I dropped in to have a quick cup of coffee. As always I was welcomed by the two lovely Sharons. They always greet me with a smile and talk to me like we are old friends. Even watching them with other customers is so great to see. They show what good customer service, friendliness and professionalism is all about and are a credit to your company. They are the reason I pop in for a cup of coffee or bite to eat when passing by.",5,2019,12,11
249,Lovely lunch,There for lunch this week with some friends. Food and service was great. The two Sharon's did everything to make our girls lunch a success.will definitely return and recommend it to others. Well done to all!,4,2019,12,11
249,Lovely Reception staff ,"We were up for a family meal the other day and the girls at reception were so lovely and helpful,especially with our 2 youngest children.  Both Deborah and Ciara were so nice and a pleasure to deal with. A fantastic representation for the hotel.",5,2019,12,11
249,"Clean hotel, good atmosphere","Very clean hotel, really good atmosphere and was very festive this time of year. Bed was very comfy.
Spa and pool was included. Lovely spa, pool however wasn't what i was expecting and not like the pictures,and have to wear a shower cap if you want to go in it!
Other than that great hotel, close to bus links and lots of food options within the hotel.",4,2019,12,10
249,Disappointing,We stayed here last weekend and were very disappointed with the hotel  Firstly we had a problem at reception accepting our voucher in part payment. The manager was quite brash and uncompromising in sorting this hiccup out   The one saving grace at reception was a girl called Ciara who was more than helpful and pleasant. The adjoining rooms were clean and comfortable. The dining rooms were again very disappointing. The one near the bar had a very poor menu and our kids were aghast that they only offered sausages and chips and chicken goujons and chips on the children’s menu. They wondered why there wasn’t “proper food” available   We moved to the buffet meal in the restaurant and the selection again was poor and some hot meals were only lukewarm   There was no Christmas atmosphere in the dining room. One lone Santa sitting on a couch and a small few lit up sprigs   Very poor effort to create an atmosphere. Overall the hotel is tired and could do with a shake up,2,2019,12,10
249,Never again,"Grubby room, disgusting bathroom, BAD restaurant food.we were told the restaurant would open at six, arrived at 6 and managers were having a meeting so we were asked to wait until it was open. 6.18 we were graced with the permission of entering the restaurant. Fiery hot wings (starter) - I've had spicier ice cream. MR steak - ordered 2, both were WD. Skipped dessert. 3 of the red wines we ordered were not on the list of 6 red wines. Asked for a Spanish rioja, our wedding wine, and were told ""we are out of that wine but we have other Italian reds"" we hate to complain or write bad reviews but for the grace of all gods, please don't stay here.",1,2019,12,10
249,Disappointing Noisy Night,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary on the 8th November. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the bar / restaurant. The room was spacious but wasn't happy it was an adjoining room and to make matters worse, a room that was occupied by what seemed to be teenagers /kids who were noisy til the late hours.Not their fault but I think we should have been advised it was an adjoining room also. As this was a rare  night away on our own for our Anniversary, we were so disappointed. We posted a review on booking.com but never heard back.",3,2019,12,09
249,What a charming staff...,"I had a wonderful lovely lunch in the bar....and I had to say what a charming were Sharon& Sharon!!!.... They made my day.... smiling, chatting and charming.... Thank you girls!!I shall definitely recommend this hotel as I was made so welcome so thank you",5,2019,12,09
249,Average ,"Avoid the bedrooms that are facing the Liffey Valley shopping centre as the traffic noise is horrendous and makes sleeping through the night impossible. The cleaning staff are conscientious and very friendly.
",3,2019,12,08
249,Excellent bar service,"I had lunch in the bar with my mother and sister in law.
 Excellent food especially the curry! Excellent service. I think our servers names were Sharon and Sharon. Lol. :) They were very professional and friendly. I would definely eat in the bar again!",5,2019,12,08
249,Lunch service,Was in for lunch. Was looked after by the two Sharon's. Food and service was brilliant. Definitely be returning again. Have had lunch here numerous times and would recommend for families and work lunches,5,2019,12,06
249,Excellent service from the staff at this hotel,"Excellent service from the two Sandra's in the main bar today. Great food too at a reasonable price. Coffee was exceptional. Upon  arrival  the staff were attentive and ready to take orders, I was only in to use the wifi and eat lunch so I am unable to comment upon the rooms or any other service the hotel may offer. The meal was fish and chips and well presented with a small salad on the side of the plate.",5,2019,12,03
249,Amazing Customer service,"My stay here was really good. Arrived here for business, and was greeted by a wonder reception team. The customer service was A+ Ciara at the reception did her utmost best to accommodate us. Really good hotel and a vibrant vibe. But the customer service from the reception made the stay better than expected.",5,2019,12,03
249,Great Service by Kirsty,"Arrived at the hotel to stay for the week a business trip....Service provided by Kirsty at reception was onpoint, great service and facilities. Kirsty went that extra mile to help.. good facilities and breakfast... #AmazingKirsty",5,2019,12,03

249,Shopping Trip,"Stayed here for one night while on shopping trip to Dublin. Was checked in by a very friendly lady called Deborah. Room was very clean and comfortable , bar staff fast  and efficient.  nice family feeling about this hotel.  Great location for shopping in Liffey Valley.",4,2019,12,01
249,Chrismats party,We had our christmas party in the hotel last night have to say the night was great food was lovley and band were great and bar staff were barillant they pull out all the stops mostly a fella called Daniel as we had a big table and he had no problem doing drinks orders for us on as we had about 20 poeple at our table and i was paying so he made it so easy for me and was very quick doing drinks a very busy night in hotel thanks again to everyone for a great night cant wait to come back again.,5,2019,12,01
249,Excellent rate ,"I booked 2 rooms here for myself and my family for one night.
On arrival at reception we were made to feel really welcome, the receptionist noticed our rooms were on separate floors so swapped rooms so we were right next to each other
The rooms were reasonably sized and very clean and beds comfortable 
The breakfast the next morning was very nice plenty of choice too",4,2019,11,30
249,Great Family Hotel,"Another return family visit to this nice hotel, will review this visit with simple points:

- Poor check in as no info given re breakfast or facilities, just told where room was.

- Booked Executive King Suite which was roomy and clean (Room 631)

- Usual quality service from bar and restaurant staff, and food was fantastic.

- Brilliant guy in room service after late return from Santa experience, didn’t get his name but really good guy who couldn’t do more to assist us.

- Breakfast was the usual quality, great choice and staff very helpful.

- Checkout was excellent, “Amanda” deserves great credit for first class customer service, well done!",4,2019,11,30
249,Great stay,"Stayed for three nights by myself. Was well looked after, friendly staff, clean, great cocktails. Very easy to book taxis through the reception desk too. 
Only downside was the very limited menu for dinner - would have loved more choice. I dined in both restaurants, food was lovely, but just limited was all. 
Breakfast was always great! Oana made sure I was catered for and always checked back. Nice touch.",4,2019,11,29
249,Family Friendly,"We just had a three night stay and really enjoyed it. Most of the staff made us feel really welcome, buffet breakfast is excellent standard and a very nice environment early in the morning.
I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good value for money. 
Pawel on reception was excellent, the bar is very professionally ran and the breakfast staff had the place running like clockwork. 
The pool area is a bonus. 
Good location for N4 and near Liffey valley for cinema or shopping.",4,2019,11,28
249,Upgrade? ,"Arrived on a wet Friday evening, we were given rooms in an adjoining building - these were apartments!!
Not needed for one night but spacious, comfortable and clean.  Had a good evening in the bar with family.  Highlight of our short visit was the excellent buffet breakfast next morning - fresh food and plenty of it.  An all round good venue. ",4,2019,11,27
249,Business lunch,"Great lunch here yesterday in the oriental section. Nice and quiet brilliant service from Sharon . Fee parking great location.
Very accessible from all parts of the city just off m50 heading west on N4. We’ll done all!",4,2019,11,27
249,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in facilities. Shabby decor, mattress visibally concave, curtain hem torn, dirty oven, mouldy dishwasher, pungent odor from fridge, no basic cooking equipment so no potential to self cater defeating the whole purpose.",1,2019,11,26
249,Mr,I stayed in this hotel last month. The lady on reception Deborah who Checked us in was very helpful and made our arrival very pleasant. We had a lovely room. I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely return. Would recommend this place to anyone.,5,2019,11,26
249,Outstanding hotel with outstanding service,"Arrived today to be treated by Helen at the front desk, amazing welcome and because my room wasn’t ready they upgraded me! Thanks Helen! Room is out of this world! 

I used to come here with the family many years ago and it’s just as good as it was then! Great for business and great for families! 

Can’t wait to come back!",5,2019,11,26
249,Thanks for a great stay.,"Absolutely amazing Hotel. Great breakfast and food in general. The staff is friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Ivo, Ramona and Sharon. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Situated close to the mall and on the bus route.",5,2019,11,26
249,Room not fit for purpose,"I stayed for one night. Please see photos attached. I had booked and prepaid for a double room. I was given an apartment as there was no room available. As a single female traveler I did not think this was appropriate. The apartments were in a separate building to the hotel with no room telephone available to call reception or security if need be.the balcony doors in the apartment were left unlocked so there could have been anyone in the room. The two internal fire doors had their chain hinge broken so just pushed open/close.The Hall light flicked on an off constantly. No lights worked in the bedroom. The apartment smelt of cigarette smoke and there were four furniture burn marks from cigarettes. The sofa and dining chairs were very badly stained. The carpet had patches of black engrained dirt. There was an item of stale food on the bottom of the dining table. There were Greasy hand marks on the wardrobe doors. The air conditioning unit had an out of order sign on it. There was no hairdryer or milk in the room. When I complained on the night the duty manager said he could cancel my reservation. It was 11pm, I had no option but to stay. I was offered a complimentary drink, how was that going to make things better? 
At breakfast the next morning a duty manager approached me to acknowledge the situation with the room. She offered me a complimentary breakfast. I showed the manager the photos I had taken, she appeared very shocked. I asked for a refund as I did not get what I had paid for, she consulted her manager who authorised the refund. Please see photos attached. ",1,2019,11,24
249,Breakfast,"I went to the Clayton on Thursday 21st November to have breakfast, which was very nice, and the staff there were equally as excellent and nice in particular Sharon and Ivo. I  definitly will return again in the future.

Keep up the good work and many thanks.",5,2019,11,23
249,Fantastic experience,"I was in the hotel few days ago, and I only can say that I have had a fantastic experience.

I felt welcome since the moment that I stepped in. Powel, the receptionist from that evening, he couldn't help me more, and make feel very welcoming. 

The staff from all the areas of the hotel are very friendly and helpful. The food was fantastic, and the room very comfortable.

Definitely I will comeback.
I will also would like to mention Helen from reception.

Thank you everyone.

Regards, 

Olimpia Crisan",4,2019,11,22
249,Meeting Room,"Very well looked after by Diana this week. Nothing we asked for was too much trouble. The room was perfectly set up and all amenities 5 star. Diana had validated car parking tickets ready for me to give out to all my attendees which was a lovely touch. She also ensured there were gluten free options available for my attendees.

I will happily choose this hotel for all my future meeting room needs.",5,2019,11,22
249,Exactly what i was looking for!!!,"First of all im not one for writing reviews as im constantly moved around for business, However i felt quite at home at this establishment. Im quite particular to whom i converse with,The staff were so helpful and could not do enough for me ESPECIALLY Deborah from reception she held such professionalism dealing with me,a warm and charismatic smile and a''hello'' everytime i passed reception,and if i ever needed a lift in my spirits Deborah would always go out of her way to ask how i was, Iv visited alot of hotels around europe and i have found this gem of a hotel....... Thanks Deborah youve restored my faith in humanity again .....Thank you Clayton Liffey Valley i shall return.",5,2019,11,22
249,Mr Charlie.,I have just visited the Club Vita this morning at the Clayton Hotel liffey valley. The very friendly and helpful staff member Martin showed me around the facilities which were excellent. I will definitely be joining and looking forward to meeting the staff again.,5,2019,11,21
249,Mid week trip,"We have just stayed for two nights in a family room. We checked in with ease, the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The room was clean and very comfy beds. The food in the restaurant was tasty. We enjoyed the pool as a family. Helen checked us out on the morning of departure and again was very helpful. It's a short walk to the bus stop for the city/zoo. Next to the shopping centre is also a bonus. Would be happy to stay here again.",4,2019,11,20
249,Good food and service,Only visited for lunch in the bar area but I was very happy with what I got. The cajun chicken burger was a generous portion and decently priced. The bar area is spacious and clean. Sharron who served us was also very friendly. Would highly recommend!,5,2019,11,18
249,Perfectly adequate ,Stayed here for work. Room spacious. Good hairdryer (v important!). Fast check in and check out. Little fridge (empty mini bar) if like me you like copius cups of tea and coffee and bring your own milk. Room was comfortable and good temperature.  Breakfasts were normal buffet fare. Nothing spectacular but perfectly fine. Usual selection of hot food and continental breakfasts.  Parking in underground was quite tight so if you have a long or wide car expect to do a good bit of toing and froing especially if it is busy. I parked outside the second night.  Didn't seem to do room service for breakfast. Car alarm going off at 3am woke me but otherwise it was quiet in the area I was in.  Obviously very convenient to liffey valley shopping centre.  Overall was fine and would stay again for work.,4,2019,11,17
249,Very Disappointed,"We stayed here for one night, great location & pool was a good size. Very familiar with The Clayton Hotel chain, and usually very pleased. Nothing more went well though...between noise, mainly late at night, neighbouring room occupants smoking and awful, very expensive breakfast with very poor quality food - we felt we had been taken advantage of! Will find another option when in this area again which is a shame.",2,2019,11,14
249,Liffey suites,Booked a double room. Actually got a one bedroom suite in the adjacent building. Lots of room and if our stay was longer I might have made more use of it. Also I probably wouldn’t have booked breakfast if I had known I had a kitchen. Price was very reasonable but the suite although very clean was a bit worn looking. Could do with new carpets and sitting room furniture,3,2019,11,09
249,Meeting in Clayton,Had a meeting here yesterday. It is a nice modern business hotel beside Liffey Valley Shopping Mall. I was surprised it had paid parking as a out of town hotel! The interior is nice and modern with lots of comfortable seating. I like the coffee bar in the lobby area.,3,2019,11,07
249,Pre-Hospital Stay,"Have stayed here more than once. It's fine, but a very busy Hotel. We stayed the night before my daughter's Hospital appointment. The room was very noisy throughout the night, with loud guests in an nearby room making a considerable racket until after 2.30am. Not ideal when you've an anxious child and have to leave the Hotel at 6.00am. On checkout, the Reception staff didn't even enquire as to how our stay was!",2,2019,11,06
249,Not very clean and very disappointing,"We stayed here from Friday 1st November to Sunday 3rd November. We have previously stayed in Maldron and Clayton hotels so were expecting to have a great stay.
The check- in was reasonable enough. We ordered room service on our first night and it was good value and quick.
The problems were with the cleanliness of the room. The lamps etc were dirty and dusty. The bathroom sink took forever to drain as did the shower, they are in good need of maintenance.
We were away for most of the day on the Saturday and when we returned about 11.30pm we were shocked to find the room had not been cleaned, or fresh towels, toilet rolls left. With having 2 small children with us, this was not acceptable.
We told the receptionist when checking out about our concerns and she stated the duty manager would ring or contact us by email.
We are still awaiting them to contact us.
Would not recommend this hotel and have to say that the location is basically in the middle of an industrial estate. Please note also that you have to pay for parking even though the hotel is nowhere near the City Centre.
Very disappointed.",2,2019,11,05
249,Worst Customer Service,"I originally booked and requested to have something special done for our stay as it was my husband’s birthday but they didn’t organise anything. 
Also, a NICE woman in reception gave us a FREE parking pass for the first night. But when checking out the blonde woman at the reception was SO RUDE and charged for the 2 nights. Even when the parking machine was only asking for 6€!!!

I then complained to the Deputy Manager (Ciaran I think his name was) but he wasn’t very accommodating and just said he will “investigate” the whole thing. He didn’t even offer to give back free parking because of all the inconvenience. 

Also, this whole thing feels very racist to me because if it was an Irish person complaining I’m very sure they wouldn’t be so rude. 

Just the worst hotel service we’ve ever experienced and we’ve travelled a lot.",1,2019,11,03
249,Lovely break!,"I don't normally write reviews, but this time we  really enjoyed our stay at Clayton Liffey Valley. Kids had a lot of fun swimming at the pool, myself and hubby loved the shopping centre, located within walking distance from hotel. Our family room was spacious and clean. We enjoyed our meal at the Bar, our waitress, I think named Ina was very friendly and professional, with good knowledge of food allergens and was able to accomodate  our special dietary needs.",5,2019,11,01
249,Relaxing stay,"Stayed at Clayton Hotel with my partner in October, hotel is lovely and was not overcrowded as it could be during school midterm break, which made our stay more relaxing :) Breakfast was quite good, unfortunately the Italian restaurant wasn't open for dinner, but we enjoyed our meal at Globe bar/restaurant. The food was lovely, we enjoyed Calamari starter and their Thai curry is really good. Loved the positive attitude of staff around the hotel, Amanda at reception and Ena from Globe made our stay a bit more spacial.",5,2019,10,25
249,Perfect stay,Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed our stay here the staff were very friendly and the facilities were flawless. I remember a young man by the name of Adam being especially welcoming as he helped us enjoy our stay. Will definitely be coming back soon,5,2019,10,24
249,Disappointed ,"My family and I are currently staying in the hotel, Thursday 24th October.  My husband booked an executive suite for us for one night. 

Upon arrival my husband dropped myself and the kids off to check in and continued on his way for a meeting. It is there where we were not allowed to check in as I did not have my husbands credit card with me, which was used for the initial booking. I offered my debit card but was told that was not adequate.  I then phoned my husband to ring and pay via phone using the same credit card he used for the initial booking.  He was then told via the phone call that he could in fact not pay for the room over the phone???? My husband tried to explain that you can take a booking for a hotel room over the phone but when offering full payment we were refused?????

It resulted in my kids and I sitting in the bar, as the restaurant was closed, for two hours.  Once my husband arrived back we went to the bar restaurant for food. Kids were given lovely coloring menus but the staff had no coloured crayon’s for them to use.  We ordered two main courses for the adults and two kids meals.  We got our meals first, followed by the kids ten minutes late which I thought was inappropriate. 

My husband then checked us into our executive suite where we were told we were booked into a family room in which we would all be in one room. My husband had to stand his ground and show the receptionist the receipt of our original booking for the executive suite.  The receptionist ageeed but we had to wait an additional 15mins for the room to be ready. 

Finally, at 9:30pm, after arriving in the hotel at 7pm we got into our executive room. To which we found one single made up bed for our two children. Again, had to speak to reception to get the pull out couch dressed and made into a bed. This in turn took a further 20minutes. 

Overall I’m very dissatisfied with every aspect of our stay and for a 4 star hotel this is unacceptable.  It was also my daughters 7th bday. Which added insult to injury. 

Sent from my iPhone",1,2019,10,24
249,Very poor,"Very grubby room and paid €126 for 1 night. Heating on full blast all night, thermostat broken, no reply from reception, no hairdryer, broken shower head, stained curtains, desk area but no chair to allow me to work. Needs a complete upgrade . cheap and nasty instant coffee. Never again!",1,2019,10,24
249,Wont be back,"I stayed here last Saturday, October 19th.
The check in was practically an interrogation! But as it turns out, this is actually a direct provision location. This is not advertised by the hotel to give the guest the choice of booking here or deciding to stay somewhere else.
For most of my stay, there were a number of individuals roaming around the hotel lobby and bar area that didnt exactly encourage me to want to stay there. The attitude and manner of them was quite intimidating.
The bar staff are quite slow on service. There were 2 staff members, a young guy and blonde girl standing behind the bar chatting away while I was trying to order a drink and they just blanked me until one of the bar men told them ""there's customers waiting""

I was very disappointed in my experience and wont be back.",2,2019,10,23
249,Lovely hotel and shopping centre,"Great hotel, excellent breakfast, handy location beside huge Shopping Centre and excellent leisure centre complete with full gym and swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi. Lovely friendly staff, special mention to Ina in the Bar,very professional, great service! Will defo stay again!",5,2019,10,23
249,Great stay at reasonable cost,The Room was excellent. Reception staff were efficient and pleasant..  Unfortunately the restaurant was closed and we opted for the bar food.  Not great.  Would dine out when there again.  Good breakfast.  Safe and convenient car parking.  The meeting room was perfect and I would recommend it for meetings.  Sylwia looked after me very well.  Looked after my bookings right up to the end. ,4,2019,10,21
249,Excellent Service,Recently stayed here for business and found it outstanding. Breakfast is superb and Sharon and her staff are helpful and friendly. Pool facilities are clean and standards remain high. Keep up the good work ,3,2019,10,21
249,Family day out,Nice hotel. Staff very helpful.Mattresses on the beds very comfortable.Room was clean.Good and tasty food.Shopping center Liffey Valley just 5 minutes walk. Leisure centre. That was a good family day out.,5,2019,10,21
249,Great Breakfast ,"We stayed in the service apartment. There was 5 of us and due to the movie they moved us to the apartments which was great, we still got breakfast with our booking but the room in the apartments was great, as we.stayed for 3 days. They have in the larger apartments a washer dryer which was very welcomed. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a meal or just have coffee. There is an elevator to get to the rooms, there are stairs as well, the apartments are all on one level, tv's in each bed room and lounge room. You have a balcony and door to let in fresh air. We found the food to be great for both dinner and breakfast. You do how ever have to walk to both and it's not undercover, so if it's raining you get wet. I would stay again. ",4,2019,10,20
249,"Persistent and deliberate disruption to privacy, so bad I was going to call the police","As a freelance travel journalist I always stay at hotels unannounced so I will not be treated better. This always generates a real experience.
I stayed three nights. 
1) The breakfast hostess deliberately pretended not to see my breakfast reservation. I found out from reception later that she lied. But WHY? I speak to the manager who happens to come over and say this is equivalent to harassment. Thats stress for ten minutes. That harassment continues.
2) My room door I put a do not disturb sign on and notify a housekeeper I will not need cleaning. Not once but TWICE I get her knocking and asking whether I needed cleaning. All within an hour.
I realise something is up as on my return from the front desk to complain about this deliberate harassment my room card is deactivated.
3) My room card is deactivated a further two times. This can ONLY be done by the front office. As a freelance travel journalist I know this. The term is called Card bombing. Which means deliberate temporary room lockout until you go to reception. Never accept thst your card was deactivatef by your phone. This is deliberate harassment.
4) Finally either when I am out or when I am asleep some piece of lowlife xxxx puts a do not disturb sign in my room.

Disgusting just plane disgusting and I look forward to writing my travel piece and doing this contemptuous too big to fail(hundreds of rooms) and sucking on the teet of European conference money, and disdaining the private guests, the justice it deserves. Maybe if a few future conference organisers see this review they will take their big budgets elsewhere. The welcome of Ireland. Shame on you.",1,2019,10,20
249,Definitely be back!,"Just back with a stay with friends and would highly recommend the hotel, the food was amazing and service too, We were served by Adam and Anthony through out the night, couldn’t have thanked them more for everything. The room was to die for and will definitely be back soon",5,2019,10,20
249,Great Hotel. Amazing Staff.,"Recently stayed here with friends while visiting Dublin.
Staff were really friendly and helpful. Especially Ciara M, who went the extra mile to help us on multiple occasions.
Will definitely be staying here when we're next in Dublin.",5,2019,10,20
249,The globe,"My waitress Julie was extremely pleasant. She served us quickly and with a vibrant attitude. She was also very informative when we were ordering and it was very helpful. The bar was very clean and presentable, will be returning very soon.👍",5,2019,10,17
249,Nice location for quiet break away,"Secure underground parking. Friendly reception. Lovely double room. Bed very comfy. Basic bathroom, nice shower pressure. Que for breakfast about 10 minutes wait between 9 and 10. Very nice breakfast. Residence bar not the best atmosphere or seating but staff very friendly. Guinness was good. 
Walking distance from liffey valley shopping centre. 
Would highly recommend especially when not looking to go into city centre.",4,2019,10,15
249,Amazing service,"I work away every week and stay in many different hotels, this has to be one of the best. The reception staff couldn't be more obliging, they went out of their way to make my stay amazing. Thanks Ladies",5,2019,10,13
249,Disappointed,"We stayed here with our baby for one night.there was a long confusing walk to our room, no cot as requested before arrival and the room was freezing with the window open far from ideal with a newborn in tow. Bed was comfy could have done with extra pillows and blankets I was cold but too lazy to request more if I'm honest. Bathroom was small but room was fine. No restaurant open for dinner and v poor expensive choices in bar menu. Wandered next door to a fab Asian restaurant instead. Shower was good plenty hot water. Breakfast was not good. No fresh tea and coffee but two burco type flasks over by a wall in the middle of the dining room, one of coffee and another of boiling water, no milk and no choice of milks. Waitress wasn't bothered when I told her. No milk on table and no jugs for milk for cereal pour it in bowl or do without No trays available for breakfast, apparently when I asked they don't do that but got me one which three other patrons asked me where I had got it. Bit ridiculous ppl trying to manage everything and the hot breakfast plates weren't warm they were boiling hot. A woman warned me in time before I touched them. Cooked breakfast was very disappointing potato cube things were so dry they stuck to the roof of my mouth, the rashers and puddings were of poor quality and jumbo sausages I didn't taste. The mushrooms however were fab, eggs were there a while. Big cubes of cheese brie  etc looked unappetising and bread selection wasn't good no fresh berries or smoked salmon either.the fresh oj was lovely. Overall if you want somewhere to throw your head down for the night it was fine. Avoid the food there. The leisure centre was off on the other side of the hotel past the reception and bar we didn't visit didn't want to trek all the way back.",3,2019,10,11
249,Quite Helpful ,"Enjoyed our stay the staff were helpful as my sister had hurt her leg traveling they were helpful with ice etc but the Standout was the Coffee made by Leo best we have had in a long time he was also polite and friendly,  chloe in the resturant was also very helpful ! ",4,2019,10,10
249,The Globe restaurant,"The Globe Bar and Restaurant at Clayton Hotel Great spot for dinner and night time pints 🍻 with extremely friendly professional staff especially Ina Barisova, she make our evening 5 of 5 . I definitely recommend it",5,2019,10,09
249,A little stop over after a hard day's work,"Staying in the Clayton was definitely a good choice. We just decided to stay as we were tired and didn't want to drive. As a last minute booking we got the room for 72€.The girl at reception was really nice and validates our parking tickets so we had them ready in the morning. The place is a clean and the rooms very spacious. We were given toothbrush and tooth paste.
We had a lovely rest.",4,2019,10,08
249,Superb Staff,I stayed in Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley on 4th October. It was very busy but check in ran very efficiently. I could not sufficiently compliment Helen on the front desk. She was extremely professional and pleasant and offered me an upgrade to a superior room. This made my stay most enjoyable. I also ate in the bar where the food and service were equally good! ,5,2019,10,08
249,Enjoyable comfortable stay,"Stayed here for 1 night after a long flight. Room was excellent with tea/coffee facilities. Very well presented. Bed was very comfortable. Reception pleasant and helpful. Breakfast super. 2 negatives for me however, one being the €6 parking fee on exit and the other being the cost of drink in the bar. Enjoyable all the same.",4,2019,10,08
249,Lovely Hotel and friendly staff,"Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley is our hotel of choice when visiting Dublin, the location is just perfect! Standarts are as high as ever, hotel is lovely, nicely decorated, rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable, as good as at home! We had our dinner at Globe restaurant, was handy that you don't have to book, just walk in. Food was fab, enjoyed calamari and their Best Ever curry is BEST EVER! Special mention to Ina , our server, she was absolutely amazing,  nothing was too much for her, we had a lovely chat, also Cheri, the lad behind the bar, well done,  service was excellent!",5,2019,10,06
249,"Top marks, great hotel",Stay here quite regularly. Would highly recommend it for its value and cleanliness. Staff are always very friendly and professional. On my last visit Helen on reception was very helpful and courteous. She is a credit to the hotel and I’m sure a very valuable member of the Clayton team. Well done,5,2019,10,03
249,Needs improvement ,"I recently visited this hotel for a short business trip. Check in was a very slow process. The staff were friendly on arrival.
I was really hungry and proceeded to the carvery area only to be told that this was closed! Yet people were eating here. I later realized and it was confirmed that the people eating there were refugees.
The menu in the other restaurant was limited so I chose to dine elsewhere.
Room was comfortable after I wedged a magazine and shower cap onto the patio door lock to block out the road noise!
I wouldn’t be in a hurry to recommend staying here again.",2,2019,10,02
249,Lovely staff ,"I have frequent nights in hotels as I travel with my work. My recent stay here was surprisingly pleasant. I didn't have high expectations as most of these style of big business hotels are the same. However the Clayton Liffey Valley exceeded my expectations. Very friendly and helpful staff. A big bedroom and super comfortable bed and pillows. Delicious meal at lunch time for our conference event. I will stay here in future when I am in Dublin. 
 ",5,2019,10,02
249,Nice Stay,"I stayed at the Clayton for 2 nights recently with my wife and 2 toddlers. I was very happy with the hotel.

Pros:
- Good location right beside the m50, handy if driving to the hotel 
- Hotel staff were extremely friendly anywhere we went, be it at reception, breakfast or the bar. 
-Swimming pool was great. Had the toddlers in there. There's a large pool and a small pool. Small pool ideal for toddlers and small children as it is shallow. Towels provided for free at the leisure centre. 
- Breakfast buffet was great. Good selection. Bacon was superb and loved that there was wheaten bread on offer. 
- very close to liffey Valley shopping centre which has a big tesco out the back of it. Very handy.
- small fridge in the rooms. Great for keeping milk for the children and the odd beer cold. 
- Good atmosphere at the bar and the staff are friendly and good Craic. Not a rip off either for the drinks unlike some other hotels. About the standard price you'd expect to pay in Dublin. 5.30 euro for a Guinness. 

Cons:
These are quite minor but contribute to the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars:
- the room was very hot. 25 degrees was the coolest it got even with the window open. There wasn't any air con. 
-some staining on the floors. Looked a bit unsightly but was only in small areas. 
- parking isn't complimentary and is charged at 6 euros per night. 
- Swimming caps required for the pool and these cost 3 euros. Don't really see the necessity for these as you can get into the pool if you have a beard without a beard cover.

",4,2019,10,01
249,Conveniently located but not great service,The hotel was close to my workplace as well as not too far from a bus stop and the airport. Noticed that the hotel was very crowded so it did nit help that one could get breakfast after queuing up for some time. The fact that the restaurant only worked for dinner on weekends did not help. Specially for folks like me who did not do alcohol it was a limited choice place. One effort to get a coffee was quite a bad experience. The coffee was changed twice but still was pretty tasteless. The billing was messed up as well. Seemed like the place was being manned by folks who really had no experience. Overall this place would not be my preferred place next time around,3,2019,09,30
249,Terrible Customer Service,"I stayed in this hotel twice in 2018 August/October - Second visit was booked before the first one. We had a few issues from the first stay - processed duplicate payments on my card - rebated one back on without notifying me (this blocked my card). Issue with lighting, which we had to go to reception multiple times to get resolved. From this, they upgraded our room for the second stay.
The second stay - I booked an additional room for family travelling. We booked a family room. They called the day prior to us arriving to confirm the stay. They had made an error with the additional room - triple and not a family which with 2 teenage boys was an issue as they could not share a single bed. We had to travel (a member of the group was doing the marathon), and I couldn't get availability elsewhere on short notice,so we took the extra person into our room - which was by no means an ideal situation.
We checked in, no apology given for their mess up, no travel cot in our room, no single bed/roll out bed in the additional room. These were rectified but not pleasant to arrive to more issues that we had to chase to be fixed. We went for dinner and again more issue, standard/service/unacceptable delays.On that occasion we were deemed the lucky ones as we only had to wait over an hour others were waiting a couple of hours.
I raised these issues at the time and on check out. A duty manager called me back, following on from and email I sent in. He apologised and offered a free night stay for both parties and we were to communicate with him for the stay.
I did so in March/April, Sent in an email and I have still received no response. This hotel in my opinion does not was repeat custom and lacks in most areas of customer service.",1,2019,09,30
249,Super hotel for business stay,"I was attending an event in the hotel on Tuesday past and so stayed the night before. I was really impressed, plenty of parking available and the room I stayed in was clearly newly refurbished and very impressive. Great big comfy bed resulted in a great nights sleep. The event itself was really good, with creative breaks and impressive audio visual set up. I'd def recommend the hotel for a conference. Didn't get to use the gym or the pool - maybe next time?",5,2019,09,27
249,Nice Hotel,"Nice Hotel perfect for families ive stayed here many times, and have to say I was quite impressed this time initially as they have tidied up the rooms, However a couple of niggles this time stopped me marking the 5* I don't normally ring roomservice but this time i was kind of short of time so said I would so that at least we had eaten,  the menu is a bit expensive but figured well a one off! I rang but was told sorry I would have to come down to the bar as the restaurant was closed (not sure why) I explained I couldn't as literally had to get ready and go again but nope couldn't help either come to bar or nothing,  my 2nd niggle was the restaurant in the morning for breakfast,  I was seated at a 2 person table (only 2 of us so fine) however I watched as other people were coming in in 4s then being placed next to me, now the tables are extremely close and the entire restaurant was quiet so sitting 2 adults and 2 children at a 2 person table baffled me especially when I kept getting knocked along with the table getting knocked everytime they moved! In front of me was 3 people at a 2 person table 2 sitting on the chairs and a child I'd say about 5 sitting in the same chair as the mum but behind her - I've kids I get it but I thought with all the space there was no need for it, maybe they had only paid for 2 breakfast and maybe that's why no idea but it shouldnt be at the expense of other paying guests.
Anyway apart from my niggles location is good and have to say some of the best beds I've slept in.",4,2019,09,26
249,Very nice hotel,Myself and my mom stayed here for 1 night as we were attending Ariana Grande's concert at the 3 Arena. The rooms were clean and the staff were nice. Would come back again. Price was very reasonable too.,4,2019,09,24
249,Refugees everywhere in the hotel,"Having waited at this hotel several times over the years, I’ve always been happy with the rooms, it’s amenities & location. The location is great if you want to shop, it’s literally a two minute drive to Liffey valley shopping centre, with a cinema & various places to eat.
The hotel pool is lovely & warm & the sauna & steam room are excellent. The changing rooms are clean & there's plenty of room. 
Gusto, the restaurant beside reception seemed to be closed both nights & it was just refugees that seemed to be eating there.
The globe restaurant is nice with plenty of seating.
The room service was very poor & the girl that serviced my room has no English so I had to go to reception.

There seemed to be refugees everywhere, on the corridors, seating around reception, standing outside. Mainly groups of men. I’m not against refugees but I really don’t think a family hotel is suitable to house them.
I wish I was informed of this before booking.
Having stayed here numerous times over the last ten years, I’m sad to say it will probably be my last. It’s very unfortunate as it used to be such a family friendly hotel.",2,2019,09,23
249,Average hotel,"Best point was the service was very good.  I was waiting for a lift for quite some time and one of the staff saw me and insisted to take me to my room (i.e. took my luggage and brought me up the stairs) and told me another route to take.  The room and bathroom were average.  The shower was annoying and the shower head kept flipping around so I had to Jerry rig it to be straight with a hair clip.  There were some particles in the shower so I did not want to take a bath.  It was quite expensive but I booked last minute so am not sure what the usual fee is.

I didn't eat breakfast but had a coffee on the way out and that was GREAT.",3,2019,09,21
249,Horrible,"Stayed here one night on a business trip. 

Paid 211€ for a night in a double room, expecting some ok standart of quality and service level. 

The minibar was empty, the toilet could not flush, no aircondition but a broken floor fan (I did not think I had to check for air con when the rate was 211€), fuldt booked hotel but only one restaurant open (not actually a restaurant but a bar showing sports on huge flat screens). 
What asking about the minibar I was told to purchase from the vending machine which was almost empty. 0.33l. water was 3€ at the restaurant. 

The room view was over a parking lot with busses and cars coming and leaving 24/7. The window could not close properly to soften the noise, so sleeping was also an issue. Maybe the rooms facing away from the parking lot had less noise. 

The pictures on the website are mis leading and If you actually read the reviews (which I obvoiusly did too late), you can wonder why the rating is so good. 

I did not receive one single smile from any of the staff during my stay. Never have I had this little value for money. ",1,2019,09,19
249,Bed Bugs,"It was a horrendous stay. I was bitten by bed bug on our first night. 2 days of our planned trips were canceled because I suffered from severe pain, itchiness and rashes. Clayton compensated me by upgrading our family room to executive suite and giving us free dinner and breakfast. They also paid my medical and medicines bills. 
However me and my friend who has physical disability who came over from the far east missed so much activities and experience.",1,2019,09,19
249,Great customer service,"We have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, mostly in a family room.
This time we were put in a non renovated room. Its a big difference. The rug was stained, lamps were rusty and bedding was blah.
I asked to be moved, and was quickly upgraded to a renovated suite.
What a beautiful beautiful room.
I highly recommend booking this room and will do so in the future.
1 bedroom has king bed and pull out sofa, second bedroom has 2 twin and mini kitchen. Bedding was beautiful, room was clean and Im very greatful for the upgrade.
My suggestion to the hotel is continue to renovate the rooms they look much better. Also all beds should have mattress pads then sheets for comfort and sanitary reasons. 
I have never seen a nice hotel without them. The king bed had it but not the twins. 
The pool is always good for kids and lastly the food at the restaurant and room service is amazing!",5,2019,09,17
249,Room needed redecorating,"Stayed at the hotel on Saturday night, as part of a wedding reception party.  The Phoenix room was excellent venue for the reception, staff were very good.  We were charged EUR159 for bed and breakfast, which we were told was a special rate.

Breakfast was good.

Whereas the room that we stayed in really needed to be decorated.  There are what looks blood splatters on the wall on one side of the bed and many knocks in the wall on the other.",3,2019,09,16
249,Functional,"Stayed for one night and chose the hotel for its location to work.  Check in and out staff were excellent, very quick and all completed with the minimum of fuss.  Didn't eat at the hotel due to late arrival and early departure. If you need a hotel in Liffey Valley this will do, if you want to be closer to Dublin centre this isn't right for you.  As a word of caution, some rooms are on the lower ground floor, mine had no ambient light and was next to a stairwell that was noisy on occasions.",4,2019,09,16
249,Absolutely shocking Prices,"I paid €3:50 for a cup of tea! €3.50 is ridiculous for a teabag , some milk and the service itself! I’m shocked. I shared a pot of tea with my friend who also had to pay €3:50!? Madness. €7 for a pot of tea, I have never heard the likes of this .",1,2019,09,14
249,Excellent standards,Having recently had the unfortunate experience of staying 2 nights at the Clayton hotel in Leopardstown and the lack of hygiene there we checked in to the Clayton Liffey Valley for our last night and were delighted from arrival we were greeted by professional friendly staff the hotel was clean the room was spotless well equipped.The lobby bar and restaurant are welcoming the restaurant food was fantastic as were the staff .Excellent standards of hygiene and customer care convenient location thumbs up the management and staff here should be commended definitely recommend this hotel ,4,2019,09,14
249,Nice Lunch.,"Had a very pleasant lunch in this hotel. A hotel with a very nice restaurant, good food served by friendly staff,at a reasonable price.Nice modern decor, and a good atmosphere,fresh and well designed.",4,2019,09,14
249,Adequate ,"Stayed with a relation who had an early morning medical appointment at the nearby Heritage clinic .
Check was extremely slow and not particularly welcoming . 

Our room was quite a distance from the reception area , down two very long corridors. The room itself was very clean and the beds comfortable but far too warm .
The shower was over the bath - one of those where you pull levers to switch from bath to shower . 

The Italian restaurant was closed and the bar/restaurant was packed with s waiting list for tables .Service at the bar and for food was dreadfully slow - there didn’t seem to be anything like the amount of staff needed to service either areas .staff members were polite and helpful , it must be said . 

The food menu is quite limited, we opted for the chicken wings - good, soup - was so-so . For mains we ordered the curry and the burger . Curry was good , if not a good portion size . The burger at €16 came with chips and some very sad and ancient salad leaves , such as one might find pre-packed in a supermarket . 
Tables were very close together and we were unfortunate to be seated between two very noisy tables .

All in all, the hotel served our purpose as an overnight stop, but realistically, we wouldn’t be rushing back here for an extended stay . ",3,2019,09,12
249,Great venue,Best hotel for big birthday party and great food! Food was served on time and was fresh and delish.  Staff were all accommodating and helpful. A big thank you to Helena and Stephen for all the assistance. Highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,2019,09,11
249,VERY NOISY HOTEL,"Stayed Saturday week ago as a stopover before an early flight the following morning from Dublin Airport.   The hotel is well enough located for access to the airport.  Car parking is for a fixed charge also.

Check in was very slow and we had to stand in a line for about 20 minutes.   Once we got to our room it was fine. The room itself was clean if a little worn.

The main problems we encountered were all noise related.   We ate in the hotel bar and there was a large crowd of noisy men who were disturbing everyone by their boisterous shouting/laughing etc.  Not to be a killjoy but it was ridiculous.  The food itself wasn't great.  It was also over-priced in my opinion.

Once in our room the issue again was noise.  There were different parties running in the hotel and the corridor noise and noise from a girl's birthday party constant.  Totally defeated our purpose of staying over.  Whenever we were leaving the hotel in the early hours, the party was in full swing with numerous people wandering around the reception are.

All in all, the hotel mgt should be doing more to contain noise and look after guests who paid for a night's sleep.   Although a member of the Clayton loyalty programme, I won't be staying here again and nor would I recommend it to others.  Sorry but far too noisy for me.",2,2019,09,09
249,Busy time needed a guiding hand,"My wife and I stayed the Saturday night before the Camogie All Ireland finals in Croke Park. We expected the hotel would be busy as indeed it was. Room was clean and all in order. Breakfast the next morning however was not a success. We were sent to an overflow dining area as the main restaurant was crowded. There were no cups, and no tea. There was a coffee dispenser but with no mugs.... We ended up going back to the main dining area and taking cups from there , filling up with tea and going back to the overflow area. I do appreciate that the hotel was extremely busy, my complaint is not with the ordinary staff who despite being very busy were very courteous especially the lady seating guests at the main dining area, it would be that a competent manager was not present as far as we could see, to oversee matters and direct operations. The hotel had to be aware that it was going to be busy from bookings beforehand.",3,2019,09,09
249,Worst service we have ever experienced,"We arrived early and approached reception to ask politely if it would be possible to check in early and the receptionist responded with a rude ""no"" , nothing else so I asked well when will there be a room and she abruptly responded that check in is at 3. When we returned later on in the evening to check in we were greeted by another cold receptionist. She proceeded to inform us that we must pay 100e deposit or ""there is the door and we can find somewhere to stay"". We have never experienced such ignorance as this before and have never been left felt so unwelcome. That wasnt the end of it. Upon check out they refused to give us back our deposit after not even spending 24 hours in the place until they check the room. After making us wait 20 minutes we finally got our deposit. Worst service we gave ever experience and  would not recommend staying here to anyone due to the very poor service they provide.",1,2019,09,08
249,Husbands 60th birthday,Absolutely amazing staff looked after us brilliantly nothing a bother manager a gentleman there were 15 of us adults and children what great child friendly hotel would not stay anywhere else and we most Will definitely be back AAAAA++++ Thank you once again for your kindness,5,2019,09,03
249,Unhelpful staff and poor checkin procedures,"We as a family visit this hotel twice a year and have done so for the past 5 years, on our return recently we have noticed a massive change.  The check-in procedure was atrocious with families queued up for an average 30 minute wait to check-in, certain staff members were unsure of what rooms people booked and the staff member we had could not understand any Irish accents which made the whole procedure very frustrating.  We had booked online a few days previously and we were paying in cash, we had the money ready to pay on check-in but the staff member refused to take the money and instead told us that we had to pay on check-out!!!  She then told us that we also needed a 100 euro deposit and/or a credit card to be validated before she would give us the room (that we'd booked online), we travelled for over an hour with a toddler, we had the money for the room and yet we were faced with problem after problem, it was as though they had rooms but they didn't want to sell them.  I later noticed what seemed like immigrant families coming in and out of the hotel so perhaps the government are giving the hotel money for this reason and they now no longer care about their previous paying customers.  Never be back to a hotel we loved.",2,2019,09,02
249,comfortable and friendly,"We had a very comfy sleep all 3 nights we stopped here for. Staff were friendly, had no noise other than the motorway being a bit noisy during the night. Room was a bit hot so had to use the air con provided but didn’t cool us down entirely. The bus stop isn’t far from the hotel either so perfect to getting in and out of Dublin city centre. Really enjoyed our stay overall.",4,2019,08,30
249,Spacious room but not close to the action,"We were returning from our West Ireland road trip and needed a place for a single night before our flight the next morning.  This was bookable through Diamond Resorts for a reasonable rate.

So why three stars?  

The hotel is large - too large - to get to our room, we had to walk through secure doors, down a long hallway to a second set of elevators, up to our floor and then down another long hallway.

The hotel is nowhere near downtown or the airport.  About a 30 Euro car ride to either of those.  Whatever we saved on the room rate was offset by the vehicle expense.

Lastly, although we prepaid for our room and the front desk confirmed it, we still got charged, which led to several emails and international phone calls to get it cleared up. 

The one saving grace:  The room had two bedrooms with a queen and two twins, which was nice - plenty of room for the four of us.",3,2019,08,28
249,Tayto park stay,Excellent value for money. 20 mins to tayto park. Comfortable room for 2 adults and 2 children. Nice play area and cinema room for the children in the evening. Breakfast was fine. 5 mins walk to shopping center where we had dinner in tgi s. Overall we had a lovely stay. Will visit again.,4,2019,08,24
249,Stay was ok,"We stayed at Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley for three nights and the stay was ok for us. The family room was spacious but a little bit worn. The bedrooms and bathroom were clean. Breakfast was good, but overcrowded. The same is for the pool and sauna area. There were a lot of guests there as well.
All in all our stay was quite fair but coming from another Clayton hotel before, our expectations were not fully met.",3,2019,08,23
249,Family break 4 days with Zoo & Tayto park.,"My self my husband & 2 kids 12 & 10.
Visited her 4 nights last year.
We received a warm welcome.
We were treated like royalty by all staff.
Food was delish. A big fuss was made if kids...my daughters birthday. Staff sang  happy birthday & brought out chunk of cake with candles.
Jamie went out of his way to get us bus routes taxis etc for Zoo & Tayto trips. 
Big Mike & Breakfast Sharon were so good to us.
Thoroughly enjoyed or stay.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,08,23
249,Rooms unbearably hot.,"Stayed for one night, check in was fast, we had a triple room which was really hot and stuffy, we had a portable room fan which was of little use.  The lighting in the room is really bad, no ceiling light and only one very low watt desk lamp.  Beds were comfy, but duvets are much too heavy for summer weather, we took ours out of their covers and just slept under the covers.  The Restaurant closing time is advertised as 9.30pm, we arrived at 9.25pm to be told the Chef was finished and Restaurant  was  closed.  Breakfast was chaotic we were directed from main Restaurant to overflow Restaurant where tables were not cleared, no bowls or plates, no milk , just seemed to run out of everything and took ages to replenish. One Guest told me he had Breakfast in main Restaurant the previous morning and there was no comparison between the two Restaurants  the main Restaurant was much more organized.  The left luggage are is not supervised, no tickets to reclaim luggage, when I went to reclaim my luggage I was told just to walk in and take it, anybody could just ask at reception and be directed to luggage storage where the door was not locked.",3,2019,08,20
249,Child free night away for musical!,"Arrived at 4.15pm Saturday 10th. Room was not ready even though check-in was between 2 & 3pm. Offered complimentary drink in bar while we waited. Missed lift to city centre as a result of delay and had to drive in & pay to exit car park!
Awoken Sunday morning at 7.40am by house keeping. We would have gotten a longer sleep in at home with the children! No apology or reference to the disturbance at check out. I mentioned it & they offered me a coffee!! I suggested that they validate my overnight parking of €6 instead which they did. Bear in mind I has already paid to get out of the car park they previous evening anyway after missing our lift as were late getting ready when the room was not ready.
I have since sent a query almost a week ago to the Clayton Website & have had no reply. Maybe they hope I will go away. I think for €170.90 for 1 night we deserved to have the room ready & not to be woken at 7.40am!!",3,2019,08,20
249,Where to begin !!,"Stayed here with My wife and two kids for one night. When we went to check in we were told check in was an hour later than advertised. When we finally got checking in and were paying for our room we were asked for a € 100 deposit. What !!! Never in all my years have we been asked for a deposit , maybe this shows the typical clientele that frequent this hotel but immediately this put a dampener on our stay. 
Hotel room was clean but too warm and felt wet worn 
Hotel is massive with a lot of people about moving about. Where our room was located it was a long walk with kids and baggage 
Vending machine dispensed warm drinks which was far from welcome when the heat at night in the bedroom was very warm. 
Breakfast was very busy and while food was good there was no bacon or tomatoes available despite two visits. 
With the noise and volume of people moving about it reminded me of the hotels in Disneyland Paris .!!
The swimming pool looked like it had a scum on the top of the water , public areas didn’t look clean and there were no working locking lockers available. 
On checking out I bought a bottle of coke from the vending machine , again it came out warm. I told the manager who suggested it may have just been stocked but considering the water was warm the previous night I don’t think I so !! Despite me telling him I only wanted a cold drink he didn’t offer to swap the drink for one from the Bar. 
We  definitely won’t be back.

249,Does the job,"Stayed here for two nights in a family room. 
The room was clean and in good condition.  Lots of negative comments about the stuffiness of the rooms, but in my opinion this is something that is normal in summer - not many Irish hotels need air con in the rooms apart from a few weeks in summer. Fan was provided in the room and we found it to be ok if you left the window open overnight.

Can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't use it - we did however see huge queues for breakfast both mornings.

Found staff to be helpful and friendly. 

Pool was fine - good sized kids pool.  Changing rooms could do with a little attention - a damp/musty smell hits you as soon as you open the door which isn't great.

For a place to rest our heads at night this hotel was fine. Location is good and close to good restaurants in the Liffey valley shopping centre.",3,2019,08,19
249,Disgusting,"Just back from staying at the Clayton liffey valley Hotel was highly disappointing, the hotel rooms where very small too hot and not the cleanest. Hotel its self is very run down could be doing with a revamp which you don't mind if it's clean but it wasnt. The bar/restaurant was disgusting floor was filthy dirty dishes sitting the whole way along the bar all night! The food was terrible actually I was served dessert (bonffee) it was a frozen bought in dessert with banana that was black and mushy because it was so off then covered with squirty cream on top so I couldn't see the banana! Also went to have the breakfast and food was just as bad and the floor still wasn't cleaned! Kids play corner was also dirty it had dirty coffee cups and plates siting. While we sat there 3 members of staff passed and still didn't lift them! Pool also wasn't the cleanest and showers smelled off urine! Checked out of the hotel and lady at reception asked how was your stay so I told her and she said I will call management to talk to you so I waited 10mins and no management!  They sent someone else to come speak to me who told me that they try there best and took my email! I booked through booking. Com and cancelled cause I seen the hotel had an offer with food included in a package so I payed a extra €80 to get the food and it definitely wasn't worth it! I would avoid going to this hotel and I definitely Wouldn't eat in it!!!",1,2019,08,18
249,Very nice hotel. Would highly recommend this Hotel,"Had a really nice stay over experience here. Staff are friendly, helpful and do a great job. Food is very good and the room was excellent. can only say good things about this hotel. Good location also and close enough to the city without being there.",4,2019,08,18
249,Appalling!!!!!!!,"Unfortunately we are still at this hotel!!!. We stayed here approx 4 years ago and had a great time. It has changed significantly since then.  When we checked in online we stated we would arrive at 3pm. On arrival at 3.45pm our room was not ready and we had to wait 20 mins on a room being allocated, what was the point in online check in!!!!! We were also hit with a carpark charge that we weren't made aware off. The room was clean but unfortunately the shower was like a bath tap.  The kids went to the pool and arrived back 20 mins later. The pool was so dirty you couldn't see the bottom!!!! As for dinner  I don't know where to start. We previously ate in Gusto restaurant so booked this again, however this is now a buffet. This was not highlighted on booking and was so disappointing.",1,2019,08,17
249,"Very disappointing, FILTHY!","We have just stayed one night in the Clayton, Liffey Valley. We stayed at other Clayton’s before so we were expecting the same high standard. After a long day we checked in quite late. Check in was fine. Expecting to go up to our room to shower and rest, we were greeted by pure filth!! Paying the money that we paid for one night we expect the room to be clean, we should not have to be going down to reception to ask the housekeeping staff to do their jobs and the management to do theirs also! Problems with the room (to name a few): Bathroom filthy!- bath had not been cleaned (we didn’t shower because of this), hairs in the sink, grime on taps and on the overflow on sink. Room- clearly had not been hoovered (reminants of food on the floor), lamp bases disgusting (definitely had not been cleaned in weeks), flies and cobwebs on windowsill. The bed seemed to be the only thing that was clean! I’ve never once written a negative review about any establishment but in this case I feel people need to know. On checking out we were asked how our stay was, we did mention all of the above to the receptionist. We were told we would receive a phone call later in the day by management however this has not happened. Disgraceful, definitely will not be back!",1,2019,08,16
249,Very noisy ,"Stayed here for 1 night . The hotel is very noisy. Unfortunately, our room had a connecting door to the next room and when the people who were staying there , returned around 11.30pm to their room they were incredibly noisy. They were partying very loudly until 3am and despite different people asking them to keep the noise down , it did not stop. It was so loud , I felt they were in the room with us. I was totally exhausted after a pretty sleepless night and would not stay here again.",2,2019,08,14
249,Average,"Stayed one night with grandchildren 
the reception staff were competent and sorted our booking quickly but could have told us details like where breakfast was served and where to eat dinner options  etc. One member if staff needs new uniform it was bursting at seams.
Our room was clean and comfortable but really uncomfortably hot no aircon and just a small fan which we left on all night but still had to sleep on top of bed
Bar food is served in different area after 6 apparently but nobody told us ...so sitting in bar at 5:45 we were ignored for 15 minutes eventually caught attention of and ordered drinks from haughty “waitress” who left our drinks and stated we needed to move to get food no offer to help move drinks as we struggled with 2 children and 4 full glasses plus jug of water. This same waitress with very long hair which really should be tied up for service then became a door stop ..thank goodness a good efficient waiter came for food order and was really helpful and pleasant when one of grandchildren spilt  their drink. Food was mediocre quite disappointing bland curry and rice dish which suggested contained prawns pork and chicken good luck finding prawns or pork. Expensive for bar food 
Breakfast was very average 
Pool as others have noted staff did not maintain standard of most regarding hats
So overall most of staff were helpful and pleasant ..one in particular needs customer service training 
Heat really needs sorted I notice others have complained too
Has potential to be better but repeated negative comments need action rather than standard response re learning opportunity 
Needs new chef!!",3,2019,08,13
249,Good if you just want your head down,"My wife, child and I stayed here as a last minute night away. On arrival the place seemed great. Staff on the front desk were lovely and very engaging with our daughter. Gave her a little treasure hunt to complete with stamps to collect. 
There is a pool which is a good size but the thing had been split in half for use by members of the fitness club. This meant the families staying in the hotel were left with a small pool to use or left using the kids paddling pool to the side. The rooms were spacious and clean. I usually rate a hotel on its shower. The shower in our room was pretty poor. It either shot the water out like a missile or spat it at you. The plug in the bath also didn't work so I had to unscrew it to get the water out. I haven't mentioned the restaurant in the review as I feel its separate to the hotel. But feel free to eat at Globe if you have a spare hour to wait on your food and don't mind being served substandard food or paying over the going rate for oven chips.",3,2019,08,12
249,"Lovely hotel, but could do with some improvements","Second time staying here, great location & lovely staff.  Rooms are lovely, breakfast buffet has a good selection of foods.  Our room was on to the (busy) road which was noisy so we had to keep the window closed - as there was no air conditioning & it was warm, this was uncomfortable.  We used the leisure centre a fair bit, but we had forgotten armbands for the kids and there was none available from the hotel, unless you were willing to buy them [lots of other leisure centres in hotels have armbands available for guests to use - small touch & cost for hotel, but means a lot to guests].  Ate in the restaurant one night, but very expensive as you had to pay for 2 courses - our kids just wanted something small to eat, so didn't go back there again.  Ate in the bar another night - menu wasn't great, and limited for kids.  We therefore ate out on 3rd night.  The playroom had the same (limited) equipment as was there 12 months ago on our previous visit, it could do with having some more toys for the kids.  Overall, a nice hotel, but some simple improvements as suggested here could make the stay that bit better.",4,2019,08,12
249,Terrible from start to finish,"First off gave us a apartment when we booked a double room.
Apartment block is lived in by some families full time which I have no issue with but hanging around the hall way and no staff around as the apartments are in a completely different building? 
Anyway long story short we got moved into a double room after I complained and to land to a door wide open, room with no aircon piping hot.
Terrible stay never again, furthest man from fussy ever first review I’ve ever left but had to as I was so disappointed.",1,2019,08,10
249,Chaotic ,"Stayed here for a week with work. It's so unorganised.
Both restaurants were a nightmare, slow and the food is mediocre. Not allowed to eat in the bar area.

I witnessed so many people receive the wrong orders in the main restaurant. 

The Globe restaurant was very warm and no air-conditioning.

I stayed in an apartment and there was food crushed into the stairs in the public areas for the whole week I was there. Hotel staff just walked past it. Food left in the cupboards from previous guests and I found a bottle of nappy rash cream under the sofa.

No air-conditioning in the rooms either. 

I have to say the staff are lovely, polite and friendly, customer service is great but it just feels like they have not been trained or there is poor direction leading them. 

",2,2019,08,08
249,Mixed review,"Good points hotel spotless and comfy beds.  Reception staff very friendly and welcoming,  breakfast lovely and great selection.  Bad points make sure you ask for a none facing main road room a nightmare to get any sleep.  Leisure center there is a rude male staff member who in my opinion needs customer service training.  Globe restaurant slow service and not great choice don’t order best ever chicken curry definitely doesn’t live up to its name.",3,2019,08,07
249,Nice stay,"Stayed here August bank holiday weekend for one night, arrived before check-in time but they were able to supply us with a key to our room straight away. receptionist was very nice and kept easy chat while checking us in and made sure to tell kids where movie room was and what movie was on that night (Peter Rabbit) Room was nice and clean but very hot, there is no air conditioning in the rooms, they do supply a fan which helps a little. Enough channels on tv to keep you amused. used swimming pool which seemed ok, there is a small shallow kids pool and then a big main pool, it was a little too deep for our daughter as it is 1.4m deep thoughout but we managed overall. Breakfast was nice, good selection to choose from. 
One thing that should look at is charging guests for parking",4,2019,08,06
249,Great Family hotel..,"Myself, my wife and 2 toddlers stayed for a 2 night break. Executive suite was a great job. Spacious room and living area. Good and clean. Loads of parking for the car. No complaints about the hotel except the pool is well below par.  Dampness is everywhere in the roof and the water was murky. A sense of dirtyness lingers around the pool and changing room. A good overall is badly needed of the leisure centre. Overall it is a great hotel for families but just the pool was the downfall but didnt ruin our breakaway",4,2019,08,06
249,Hot Hot Hot,"If you can't stand the heat stay out of the Clayton Hotel liffey Valley.  The heat was unbearable even with a fan and the window open. The fan was very noisey to have on but there was no way you would cope at all with the heat of the room without it. The girl at check in was nice and friendly and so were the staff at breakfast and also the breakfast itself was good.  Alas that is about the few good things I have to say.  For example we had dinner there one night and I ordered the icecream that came with chocolate sauce (the chocolate  sauce being the main reason I ordered it) and when it arrived it came with no chocolate sauce?.  I pointed this out to the waitress and she said it depends on what chef is on as they all do their own take on desserts. Now I don't think chocolate sauce is a hard thing to make and it should have been pointed out when I ordered it that it came with a sprinkle of coco powder and no chocolate sauce ( well that night anyway).  My daughter is a chef and she told me that was ridiculous and that she rekons they just couldn't be botthered to make any (even though it is so easy to make). When the bill arrived they were still charging me for it.  I pointed out to the waitress that it wasn't the dessert I ordered and I shouldn't have to pay for it, she clearly showed she wasn't happy about having to go to a manager to ask for it to be taken off the bill, it was a very uncomfortable experience but it was taken off the bill in the end. I have stayed here before but I feel it is not the hotel it once was. No music on in bar even though you would expect it this time of year, rooms too hot, you have to pay for parking even though the carpark is on hotel grounds. I could go on but I think people get the idea. At check out we were not asked how we enjoyed our stay which is common place in most hotels, this is probaly because they prob already know what a majority of the guests answers would be. Don't think I will be staying here again as I really don't think they take on board guests feedback and try and improve the conditions. If you do decide to stay one tip, pack your swimsuit, and I don't just mean for the pool 😉.",2,2019,08,06
249,Mr J Dunn,"This is an above average 4 star hotel & I have stayed in lots😉 decent food & friendly staff particularly Leo & Jess @their coffee deck  best coffee too.
Would recommend for a short staying for business or pleasure 👍",4,2019,08,05
249,Ok stay but a few issues,"We chose to stay at the Clayton for the bank holiday weekend for a very reasonable rate but there is a reason why it was at such good value, staff are ok, some welcoming, some not, receptionist took my card details and typed in my card into the system without telling me why she was taking it, I had to ask. Fair enough we did book with a different card but I hope we aren't charged for double or anything ""extra"" Rooms were standard for a family room, we asked for a travel cot it wasn't there when we arrived, had to ring for one, room is very warm at night, we had one fan which is quite loud and with a 2 year old it took him ages to sleep. The positives of the hotel is that there is a mini fridge in the room and the breakfast is good and very accommodating for families, if its very busy they open the 2nd restaurant. All in all it was an ok stay but I doubt we will be back here again",3,2019,08,05
249,Appalling accommodation coupled with rude incompetent staff,"Stay anywhere but here - a tent in the car park would be better.

For a week and a half I stayed in this hotel and every single day there were multiple issues. The first night I stayed the restaurant could not accommodate a simple meal, I returned 3 plates, food was covered in oil and before the starters were finished they cleared away the main course - it was help yourself.  The restaurant manager for ""Gusto"" was beyond believe, rude and dismissive and shouted for 40 minutes at customers complaining. Zero options or the ability to attend to dietary requirements. 
Queuing for breakfast was mostly 30 to 40 people deep. 

The hotel itself was filthy dirty, dead moths and flies outside the room for the extent of my stay. Cups and plates all through the hallways waiting days to be cleared.

When issues were brought to the attention of staff they not only dismissed, but the issue was left without any suggestion to alleviate the problem, but argued with customers loudly. Horrid attitude and behaviour. 

Daily taxi booking was a complete ordeal - incorrect times, amount of people, and places booked after a lengthy discussion to actually book the taxi in the first place. 

Room service was also terrible, incorrect orders, under-cooked food and nearly an hour waiting for soup! 

I check out two days early and also heard some other guests checking out early too.

Don't waste you time or money staying in this hotel. 

Any good things?
Yes only a few: 
The breakfast staff were mostly very good and helpful.
Liffy Vally were shopping is walking distance with great options for food.",1,2019,08,04
249,Very disappointing,"After contacting the hotel twice in hope of a response I feel I have been left with no choice but to leave a negative review. I have stayed in the Clayton hotel in Sligo and liffeyvalley before and really enjoyed our stay, but unfortunately last Saturday night was a different experience. We booked an Executive King Suite for the night of the all Ireland semi final. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 kids. When my husband checked in there was only one bed made up in the room. He rang reception who said they would send someone to make up the sofa bed and set up another bed. This bed never came. I would have expected at least a double , single , and a sofa bed to accommodate 5?? It was a very warm night so 3 in a bed wasnt ideal. The sofa bed didn’t have any pillows, the spare pillows on the press had no pillowcases and when we asked for pillowcases we were asked if we really needed them?? When we asked for extra pillows we were told there was only one available.... in the whole hotel??? There was melted soap in the bath which leads me to believe the bath hadn’t been cleaned out. The bathroom was a bit dingy looking. The most worrying thing for me was the fact that there was a shower cap over the fire alarm. This is a huge safety issue and it made me wonder how well the room had been cleaned after the last visitors. Obviously they were smokers and had covered the fire alarm but it should have been noticed. It was very worrying. As I said I was slow to put up a negative review as I have had pleasant stays here before but after two failed attempts at contact with the hotel I felt i had no other choice.",2,2019,08,03
249,Club Vitae,"I have 4hours free time and I prefer to go to relax in club Vitae in Clayton Hotel swimming pool, jacuzzi for 6 person, dry sauna, steam room absolutely high standards you haven't swim suit and hat and towel no problem the staff give for you. Very important in same place you find an ultramodern gym, enjoy!",4,2019,08,03
249,Stay elsewhere,"Stayed for two nights starting 28th July 
Large queue on checking in when eventually got to the desk the receptionist was friendly however she was unable to find my booking .
I gave her my email confirmation and told her I had been in contact with the hotel that week to confirm and request a quiet location 
She asked me and my family to sit while she sorted it half an hour later I queued a second time at which point she apologized and said she had forgotten about me 
A very abrupt manager took over at this stage and accused me twice of booking the wrong date 
Despite having the correct booking details in her hand 
I informed her that I had further email confirmation if she required it but she admitted the mistake and handed me a key 
The room was lovely and housekeeping had done a good job 
The area around the hotel is rough and the hotel exterior particularly by the so called suites was littered and overgrown with weeds 
The pool was only ok a little lax on hygiene rules for my liking e.g children swimming in their underwear ( looked clean underwear but still a bit gross) swimming hat rule not enforced which I have never seen in an Irish hotel 
Breakfast was poor on the first morning 
But ok on the second though they had no record of my booking at this stage either 
Wouldn’t stay again 
Checkout was very slow for no apparent reason 
Also just checked my credit card online and I have been charged twice for my stay 
Quite amusing considering my booking was a total mystery to the staff of the hotel 
 Fingers crossed I deal with someone more efficient to sort this problem 
Overall a comedy of errors there are better hotels with staff who actually care. 
Ps believe the reviews the rooms are stifling even with two fans running all night it was uncomfortable",1,2019,08,01
249,Spacious Exec 2 bedroom rooms but tired and worn rooms,"Good location, friendly staff, nice pool, gym and bar and a good price.

The Exec suites are an excellent choice if you have a large family like I do.

Its a nice hotel but it has been well used and the rooms furniture is in need of a serious revamp (mould and holes are available to see)

Also the hotel rooms need some sort of air conditioning as it can get very warm",3,2019,08,01
249,Family break.,"The rooms were clean but uncomfortably hot.
The reception staff could badly do with attending a course on hospitality, they  were rude and disinterested both on checking in and checking out! 
Daniel in the restaurant was very friendly and attentive as were the staff in the leisure centre. It's a pity the front of house staff let the hotel down! 
Wouldn't recommend.",1,2019,08,01
249,Poor value,"All the good points - nice breakfast.
The rest well here we go 
Checked in and went to the room had to ring reception for housekeeping to lock the interconnecting doors . We wanted to go to Liffey valley , had to pay €3 to get out of the car park . Was a total of 40 mins and 20 of that was waiting in queue to get to the desk. I asked if I could get the ticket validated as a guest , no you have to pay. So every time you come into the car park it's €3
Caution it's €6 per night to park your car. 
The rooms are boiling there is no air con. There is a tower that you plug in which offers a little relief but really non effective. 
The bar had no Budweiser , Hop House 13. And that's only what I asked for. And to be fair to the 1 barman he tried to serve as many people as he could while other staff including supervisors were walking around. Long wait for bar food but that would be expected with the numbers on site. Bar like a crèche but again with people waiting to be expected. There is a very enthusiastic gym instructor at 7 am as you can hear him motivating his class across the car park. The little things are the most annoying i.e. 3 in a room only 2 cups. So you all can't have a tea or coffee at the same time. Only 1 chair in bedroom, 
Overall a very disappointing stay. Will not return . Ironically it would take a few small changes to make this hotel value for money. At the moment it feels like a bit of a rip off.",1,2019,07,31
249,Restaurant and staff,"Brought my mum out for lunch, seriously I cant recommend this place highly, first of all the food, I had soup and a chicken and salad sandwich, delicious, my mum had fish and chips, she loved it, for the staff, 100%, the bar and waitress were brilliant, I was looking for the toilets, the manager not only showed my mum, but linked her to the toilet as she had walking stick and got staff member to walk her back, now that's what you call a top class service, thank you very much, very much appreciated",5,2019,07,30
249,Pick another hotel ,"6 month pregnant wife along with 1yr old stayed here on a Sat night. Room was not available untill 5pm, check in was 3. This is not family friendly for naps, etc.
The room was really warm with no air conditioning. The rooms either side were very nosey.
The Jacuzzi was not working on Sat evening. 
The food in the restaurant is average at best, the buffet main course was nice, but we left all the starters behind.
Felt the staff were rude and to the point and not very nice to deal with.
I wont be staying in this chain of hotel again 

",1,2019,07,29
249,Go somewhere else,"We stayed here at the end of a 10 day tour of Ireland. There’s no air conditioning in the rooms even though their website advertised air conditioning. When we pointed that out, the hotel clerk said that it did not specifically state that there is air conditioning in the rooms. The lobby and restaurants are air conditioned. The breakfast buffet was ok but the plates and glasses were dirty. If you are looking to stay here to save a few euros while visiting the city, you should go elsewhere. It costs 20 euros each way to get to the city centre unless you walk a long ways to catch a bus (which you will need exact change for —- and the hotel was unable to help us break our notes).",1,2019,07,28
249,Room unbearably hot,Booked a three day stay with the family . Got 3 hours sleep the first night . The heat in room was un real.  There was a fan in room but it was as loud as it was useless. We checked out after 1 day.  We paid in cash for the room and were told we would have to wait for a refund via bank transfer. RIDICULOUS. I would not recommend this hotel during the warmer months.the service in the restaurant was also poor .,2,2019,07,28
249,Hot and disorganized ,"Arrived to the hotel with a family of 5 earlier than the check in time of 3pm. We had two rooms and didn’t expect them to be ready but one was.  To our surprise the rooms weren’t air conditioned even though their web site says it has AC.  The receptionists response was the web site doesn’t say that and when shown the website she said that’s only for the common areas. At 3pm the second room still wasn’t available.  Once we had both rooms for our family of 5 - our kids are 16, 13 and 11 - they were on different floors of the hotel.  How does that happen.  I wouldn’t recommend this hotel for families of more than 4 or anyone that can’t handle sleeping in the heat as the rooms are NOT air conditioned.  ",2,2019,07,28
249,Amazed they Knew I was disabled.,"Straight to hotel and totally amazed that they knew I was disabled even though iam not.
These hotels tell you it’s random that coach drivers are given disabled rooms.
Well in three nights had two disabled rooms at this rate iam out now buying a lottery ticket .",1,2019,07,26
249,Pool out of action,We stayed in the Clayton hotel on Sunday night which I found to be spotlessly clean. The room 405 was spacious but the only blot on our stay was that the swimming pool was out of action for the duration of our stay. We had our two children with us so this was disappointing. The breakfast buffet was very good and the staff were very helpful. I would recommend this hotel for families. The car parking is not free in this hotel which I found to be strange even though it’s only 6 euro I don’t think hotel guests should also have to pay for parking. It was a shame the pool was out of action but that wouldn’t deter us from staying here again. It is a perfect location for those visiting Dublin Zoo. ,4,2019,07,23
249,Never again,"Very average hotel. Leisure facilities aren't great although they do look appealing in the photos. 
Bedroom was like a sauna, fan didn't work, neither did the TV remote control. Not even a single complimentary bottle of water in the room. 
Noisy bus parked outside window which had to be left open as room was too hot. Woken up at 7am by what sounded like a rave in the gym. Food was average. Lack of free parking at the hotel is also a negative.
Staff were friendly though. ",1,2019,07,23
249,Tayto park deal,"Great value tayto park deal.Very friendly helpful staff.Beds were so comfortable. Kids got great use of the pool/play area. Breakfast food/staff were lovely.
Only downside rooms were so hot. But the kids took no notice of it. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,07,23
249,Not kids friendly,We booked this hotel to bring the kids away for a night!! The first thing was when we arrived we were told the pool was closed. We were very dissappointed because they could have rang or emailed to inform us. They never meantioned any other entertainment for kids! Secondly we got to our room to realise it was a sweat box we had one fan in the room. I went down to complain and all we were offered was another fan!! As you can image we did'nt get any sleep because the fans were just blowing the heat around the room!! We would not stay here again none of us had the energy for the trip to the zoo!,1,2019,07,22
249,Tropical Room Tempretures,"Pack your bikini for bed!! This hotel is roasting even with windows open. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the front is VERY noisy facing the road. There is no air con and the fans they provide are tiny!
Kids play room is a bit of a con as they have toy machines for €2, unless you're prepared to have your kids beg for money every time you go there, avoid and head to the outdoor playground instead.
We came here on the recommendation of it being kid friendly however, playroom could do with some slides and soft toys (for younger kids), colouring in sheets, toys and books also pool could have kiddy water toys like buckets and ducks etc.
High lights, friendly staff, movie for kids in hotel cinema (if a little late for young kids) at 7pm, and early breakfast on weekdays from 6.30pm.",3,2019,07,18
249,Family Break,Excellent customer service in every area. Courteous & friendly staff. Clean & comfortable rooms.  Amazing breakfasts! Delicious evening meal for family in Gusto restaurant.  Great pool & leisure facilities. Well Done!,5,2019,07,18
249,Family meal out,The new menu in the gusto restaurant is great really nice food for adults and kids and the staff were very helpful mostly Daniel look after us the hole night making sure everything was ok for us i couldn't fault him on anything this customers service was excellent and always had a smile on this face from the time we sat down to the time we left it was just brilliant service from Daniel he is a credit to the hotel,5,2019,07,14
249,Great place to go ,The gusto Italian food was delicious the meatballs were amazing and great choice of other foods and our waiter Daniel was excellent with our kids very friendly and very helpful with some choice with food what would be not to hot for the kids,5,2019,07,14
249,Not what we booked and paid for. Very Disappointing.,"We booked an executive suite, for our family of four, as it was my son's Birthday, and we wanted more space than a family room would offer, as it was shown on their website an executive suite had a separate sitting room with kitchenette, and then two separate bedrooms. NOT THE CASE. When we arrived we found they had turned the sitting room with kitchenette, into a bedroom with a kitchenette with two single beds in it, and then one bedroom. We were VERY DISAPPOINTED. WE were told by reception that, that's how the executive suites are now. Not on your website, not as advertised.",1,2019,07,14
249,Comfortable and quiet. ,"A very comfortable hotel with plenty of amenities such as a pool, jacuzzi and steam room. The changing rooms and the pool areas were a little dated but were all clean. The hotels location is perfect. It’s surrounded by car showrooms which means it’s silent at night. 

The rooms were spotless and comfortable. The TV lost signal several times throughout the night but it was easily rectified. The beds were the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in and had more than one pillow which was much appreciated. The bathroom was clean and modern, and the shower was very powerful. There are vending machines in the lobby area which sell drinks and snacks, but be aware of them. I put in €2.00 for a bottle of water and it ripped me off by keeping my two euro and not even giving me the water. 
The following day, I tried to get a packet of crisps from the other vending machine and it done the same thing. 

The breakfast was excellent but rather expensive. There was three of us staying here and it cost us €40 a day for nothing special or any different from any other hotel. It was well presented and offered more than most would ask for. 

Proximity to Dublin City centre isn’t too far but not walkable. A bus stop, about a 5 minuet walk away from the hotel offers a bus that hops into the centre every 15 minutes or so. The bus takes about a half hour and doesn’t stop too much. 

",4,2019,07,13
249,Gusto ,"Gusto food is the best thing about the hotel all you can eat is great for a family meal and the service from Daniel on the night was fantastic very pleasant and very friendly such a nice person cannot wait to come back for another stay 
",5,2019,07,13
249,Gusto food restaurant,"We attended the hotel for a family meal , we were very welcomed from the 1st stepped into the hotel but the gusto food is amazing especially the service from Daniel on the evening he was very helpful and friendly he is an assist to the hotel , job well done and we will be definitely making this a once a month treat for the family",5,2019,07,13
249,Never again,"Before Clayton took over the liffy valley hotel both me and my wife stayed here and were blow away by the place really pleasent stay great food friendly staff comfortable room, Soo we thought we would take are son here for his birthday weekend and from the second we walked in to the hotel you could tell it wasn't the same place, the atmosphere wasn't great, the staff wasn't rude but could do with a bit more training as she didn't know what she was doing and we were left confused how to find our room, that evening we went down to get some food and was told the main  restaurant was closed and if we wanted food we had to use the bar, so we went in and waited 10 mins to get seated we were handed the menus and told when we were ready to order we had to turn a light over which turns red and then they would know we were ready to order but once we turned the light it took 24 mins before someone come over and took our order when the food came, I ordered the burger which looked like it came from McDonald's no flavour cold and very cheap looking, my wife order fish and chips but what came was 3 small fish  goujons which were cold and soggy and not great at all, so my son ordered spice chicken wings as a main now my son love spicy food and he was very disapointed the wings had no spice to then at all im not a liver of spice food but I tried them and he was right there was no spice at all, and for what we had with three drinks came to €90 total rip off, so we went back to the room still hungry to get some sleep as we had a long day ahead, and at 4am we were woken but the room next door with the TV full blast and shouting banging and it never ended untill till we got up for breakfast, now the break fast was ok but no fruit juice on offer the food was hot but we were hungry coffee was cheap instant coffee, and breakfast cost us €45 ish again a total rip off 
, We got out in to Dublin and had a great day and even had dinner out as we didn't want to eat in the hotel, we had a quieter night but could wait to leave the whole hotel stay was stressful and not worth the €300 room rate never again 😡",1,2019,07,12
249,Family Break in Nice Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel previously with young kids as the hotel is family friendly and location is perfect for various day trips (zoo, shopping, city, etc). 

We found bedroom to be clean and comfortable, however bedroom is extremely warm and humid and there is no A/C apart from fan provided which you will have to have running 24/7 to keep cool.

First evening meal was a disappointment as we waited for over 20 minutes for soup for kids before main meal, anyway meal was fine but waitresses customer service skills were poor.

Breakfast next morning was fantastic, mainly due to the outstanding customer service skills of Jamie, we met this guy on previous stays in this hotel and his professional is second to none, very good range of breakfast offerings!

Second evening dinner was lovely and made the stay worthwhile, cocktails were also lovely and bar staff excellent.",4,2019,07,12
249,Never... Again,"I stayed here with my partner and our 2 children prior to leaving for our holiday. We had to vacate the hotel at 6am to get our boat. 
Anyway, checked in and got our keys. Told to go in the door n take the lift. Into a sauna of a room we went. Absolutely roasting due to the head. Flimsy fan in the room that didn't work. We asked reception to send up a new one. Told one would be up soon. Dumped the bags and went to the pool to cool down and tire the kids as we had an early start. Back to the room we go to find it still boiling. Back down to reception I go to request a new one... Again informed that one would be sent up. We tipped into the bar for some grub which was ok, all we wanted was a sandwich but we had to ask as it wasn't on the menu. Then ask the chef if he could make a sandwich. Would have been quicker to go to marks n get the thing myself. Anyway back to the room to find a 'working fan'... the noise of it was ungodly. I knew it was going to be a long night. Anyways, we got the 2 excited kids to sleep eventually as they were roasting. We then got to try n sleep. Only for me to be woken by a horrendous rendition of the American national anthem outside and the door slamming Olympics going on on my floor to which I rang reception about. It didn't get any quieter and I had to stick my head out the door to tell them to shut up myself. 
3 hours sleep we got thanks to an over heated room among other issues. If you are going to advertise air conditioning then do it..... 
You pay money to sleep in a hotel, not to be awake all night listening to stuff that you hope and pray a night porter or staff would sort.
Oh an I forgot... breakfast offered at check in. Packed breakfast due to our early departute at the discounted rate of €13 pet adult and €6 per child. No thanks....
Never again would I stay here and I do not recommend it.",1,2019,07,11
249,Never staying here again,"We stayed here a couple of days ago. Receptionist was very rude. I booked two rooms so I had to put a name for each room, when I was trying to locate the booking confirmation the receptionist asked me “can you just pay now for the first room”. She didn’t direct us to our rooms either. We had a balcony in our room which had tablets on it either from a previous guest or dropped from a balcony above. 

After arriving home from our stay here I noticed I had been double charged for one of the rooms. I rang the hotel to get it refunded to find out I had been charged because my booking was deemed a “no show”. I asked for a confirmation email of my refund - never got it. I then rang again today to see why I haven’t gotten my refund or the email confirming it only to find out the lady I originally spoke to never issued my refund. I have been charged for missing direct debits from my bank this week. I brought it to the managers attention and asked for either a full or partial refund on my room as they did not have my authorization to charge me twice. I got told “we can only refund you the €12.70 your bank charged for missing your direct debit or give you a discounted rate on your next stay”. 

They are so quick to take your money and don’t care how it effects you when they take money they weren’t supposed to take. 

I will never stay with any Clayton hotel again after this experience.

Only positive I took from this trip is there was a guy who served us food in the bar named Kevin and he couldn’t of done more for us, he deserves a raise for having to pick up the slack for fellow employees not working to their best ability.",1,2019,07,11
249,No longer a Four Star Hotel - Major Disappointment!,"My family and I regularly stay with the Clayton . This was the second time in row we have stayed at the Clayton in Liffey Valley. Upon first impression there was a lot of wear and tear in the room from rusty bathrooms tray , discoloured tiles ,remote control broken, no air conditioning and most important the fridge freezer in the room was broken.

I have two small boys and I myself cannot have gluten so I usually always book a room with a kitchenette for convenience.  I reported the fridge was broken with the door hanging off and maintainence came and allegedly fixed it ,only to come back later and the fridge door still hanging off ,water everywhere and all our food spoiled. I again reported it to the hotel who agreed "" yes the fridge is broken"". They didn't even replace anything ,not even milk for our cereal. 

In addition, on both nights a group staying at the hotel were up all night screaming , playing music , singing and overall extremely loud so on both nights nobody got sleep despite multiple guests on our floor including ourselves reporting it . 

Upon check out again ,I brought all this again to their attention,  I received a half apology with a card from Orma saying ""when you come back we'll give you complimentary breakfast "" which I  want eat . 

Thanks but no thanks , we will never return to this establishment!!",2,2019,07,09
249,Perfect stay,"Stayed two nights here. A great hotel just outside of Dublin about 15 mins. Reasonably priced. Up the road from it is a major shopping centre, you can drive into Dublin or catch a taxi around 20-25euro or catch a bus 3 euro, the walk to the bus stop is about 5 min past the shopping centre across the bridge, we found this the best and cheapest way. It also showed us a bit more of Dublin. The hotel has a great restaurant Gusto’s and also a bar/cafe. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,08
249,Great hotel,"The bar staff are excellent,  the ladies both called  sharon have been an emince help and the perfect hosts and coco , and I would recommend them to work in the hotel  for for the forseeable future.rooms are lovely and clean and  food is great also do a nice cold pint ..",5,2019,07,04

249,Busy hotel,"Family room was a decent size but very hot, fan was supplied. Swimming pool was great for the kids. Food was average enough. €6 for overnight parking. Hotel is in good location for a stop when traveling on to other parts of Ireland",3,2019,07,02
249,Helen,I'm a returning guest as it's such a convenient location and great service but this time I had the pleasure of meeting the lovely Helen on reception for the first time. Although all the staff are lovely this is the first time I was ever made feel appreciated as a returning guest. Helen's customer service and professionalism is A1 and the Clayton are lucky to have this lady on their team. She is an absolute credit to them.,5,2019,07,02
249,Great hotel ,I’ve stayed here a number of times the staff are amazing always go out of there way to help especially the two Sharons in the bar and coco food has never let me down and the rooms are clean and fresh... keep up the great service until next time ..,5,2019,07,01

249,Excellent Breakfast ,Stayed over recently really friendly hotel check in was fast and efficient the breakfast was excellent the next morning. The service and food in the bar very good. I will definitely be back. Well done ,5,2019,06,28
249,Best Staff,"I want to highlight a particuliar member of staff Sharon who went out of way to help me on a recent business trip to the hotel. 
She could not do enough for me at breakfast-So helpful, so cheerful, would brighten anybody's day up and a great asset to the hotel.",3,2019,06,26
249,"I’ve been wanting to write this for a while, amazing hospitality!","I’m a regular attendee to the Clayton Hotel for business purposes, using the conference rooms once a month. 

I just want to say show appreciation to the amazing hospitality to the hotel staff, who go over and above for me every time, in particular Diana and Keith. 

Always having a smile on there face and providing me and clients with world class hospitality. The food is always perfect and it’s like they can read my mind, if I need something it’s there before I even ask.

The rooms are perfect, service is super fast and kept to a very high standard at all times. 

I would definitely recommend to anybody to visit the Clayton and I won’t be changing anytime soon. 

I also stay in the hotel overnight a lot and the beds are super comfy, and breakfast is great.

Thanks guys, absolutely world class service!",5,2019,06,24
249,Lovely place,"Room was perfect, all the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Young man at the bar called Adam was particularly nice and really kept us amused while we were down there. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,06,22

249,Part of Leger tour around Ireland,"This hotel caters mainly for coach tours, but does so well. Rooms are roomy and comfortable with all required facilities. Breakfast buffet was adequate. Dinner was par for the course for mass produced food. It is a pity that so few staff were native Irish. Communicating was at times difficult due to language and lack of training.",4,2019,06,15
249,absolutely splendid !!!!,I stayed over at the Clayton and what a fantastic hotel this is.  Check in went well and the room was super clean and smelled so fresh.  Went over to the Globe bar for dinner which i did enjoy.  The breakfast was just absolutely one of the best iv had in ages.  I will surely be back again to this lovely hotel.,5,2019,06,14
249,NEVER again - almost 8 Euro for 2 cups of coffee,"We used to come here regularly when it was the Clarion and it was always lovely, staff were really nice and helpful.  All changed.  This evening, after a long wait we were charged 7.90 for 2  Americanos.  To add insult to injury they were barely tepid which might explain the reluctance to provide milk!!  Almost 8 Euro for 2 cups of coffee!!",1,2019,06,11
249,Not happy,"I have stayed here several times before. But this has bein the worst.. I stayed with my husband an 2 kids for two njghts. I never complain but it was a disgrace the rooms were dirty, the hair dryer didnt work. The telly wouldn't work kept knocking off an on.. did not fill up tea/ coffee area the next day had no spoons or cups as I was using them for feeding the kids snacks.. over all I was so disappointed as I really like the area.. also one women at reception wasnt helpful an seamed very tick",1,2019,06,11
249,Work stopp over for training,"Booked at last min and got a great deal, then arrived very early howvere Piroska could not do enough for me to accmodate, she got me a great room stright away and made my whole stay. Great location you have Gym, shopping, cinema, restuarntants and bar if not in the hotel very close. shuttle bus to the airport and close to the city. 
Highly recommned this hotel....... i will always stay here when in the area. 
Thanks again Piroska

249,Christening,"I had my sons christening in the clayton hotel. We had a great day. Staff were more than helpful, and very obliging. I like the clayton liffey valley. I'm a member of the gym here too which is brilliant. Plus it's only 5 mins from where I live and a great location!",5,2019,06,09
249,Very poor services to once Loyal customer,"I Booked my wife and friend in for 2 nights, I request a room with twine beds. My wife arrived at 21.00 She was  told the room was a disabled room on the 3rd floor which was ok, the only problem it had a double bed my wife called the reception requesting the bed to split,  no one showed up called  again after an hour she was told someone would be up after a 3rd call by this time it was 1am without a response from any staff they gave up.
Next day went to reception requesting again for the bed to be split and was told yes madam by the time you get back the bed would be split she got back at about 5 from the flower show and found the bed was still the same she rang twice 2 more before something was done.
We have been staying at this hotel since 2010 about 20 to 30 times may be more this type of service was 100% more responsive back then. I will look long and hard fore I book into your hotel.   
PS. As a good will goodwill gesture she was given 2 small bottles of water how kind?",1,2019,06,05
249,Great stay in Rainy Dublin,"We stayed in the Clayton for 2 nights with our 4 and 2 year olds. Unfortunately our plans to visit the outdoors was affected by the rainy weather. We made use of the excellent pool facilities and my husband was very impressed by the facilities in the gym, particularly the weights section. A special mention for the fantastic  staff member Ivo who went out of his way to open the cinema room so that our children could watch their new DVD. He was so friendly and kind to our kids and they loved the cinema experience. He was also so friendly at breakfast. Breakfast itself was very easy and the barista bar in the reception had top notch coffee. Looking forward to staying again and hopefully the weather will be better next time.",5,2019,06,05
249,4 star at a stretch,"Booked an offer with the hotel to stay 2 nights, breakfast included both mornings and dinner 1 evening and a family ticket for the zoo.

Arrived with my wife and 2 year old daughter on Monday. I had completed the advance check in that was emailed to me 2 days before our arrival, which advised that check in is from 2pm. We arrived at 4pm, went to check in, we were told that the cleaner had gone home and weren’t sure if our room was ready, they called to get someone to check for us and could we wait at reception. Waited while I chased my toddler in and out of the front doors, on and off chairs, anything to keep her occupied. Wife went back to reception desk sometime later and asked if there was an update. “Oh, we forgot about you”, and also no one had bothered to check if our room was ready. So because we had asked a second time they moved us to a room that was ready. Happy days. Zoo tickets can’t be found..come back later for those after having to wait again at the desk. Finally got Room cards but they wouldn’t let us through the door to access the corridor to the rooms, back to reception we go. Get to our room, no cot now for toddler because they switched us rooms but don’t want to go back to reception again. Room is a good size, clean and has iron and ironing board and hairdryer. However, no biscuit for your tea and coffee and the mini bar is empty.

Dinner is included for 1 night with our stay, however, the restaurant it’s in doesn’t open on weekdays so have to go to the other one. Head down for dinner about 4.55pm, restaurant serves lunch until 5pm, no dinner until 6pm. Now we have 2 hungry adults and very hungry toddler which isn’t pleasant, so we went out for dinner.

Next day, heading out in the car need to pay €6 for parking overnight, didn’t expect that. Have to use cash to pay for parking - nowhere seems to take card!

Swimming pool is free for guests of the hotel, so head down to the swimming pool, it’s €3 to buy swimming caps, I’m ok but have to fork out another €6 for my wife and daughter. Head down to change, no way of locking the lockers, so back upstairs, it’s €5 per padlock to rent, so another €10 for 2 padlocks. Now, no towels. Find someone working down at the pool, “oh they give you towels at reception” thankfully she ran up to get them for us. Get into the pool and the swimming caps seem a bit redundant as there is a lot of bits floating in the pool. Short guy at reception desk in the pool/gym is rude. Want to use stronger words but review might not get published.

Down for dinner on the second night. 6pm, restaurant not open yet for dinner, only 5 minutes late opening but still. Head in sit down, yes dinner is included with our stay, hands us the menu, we study it for a few minutes, waitress comes back over, takes our menus away and whispers this is your menu. This menu now has prices on it so we question are you sure this is right since it’s included with our stay. Yeah that’s right because nothings showing on your room as included. So we ask her to go check again please. She does, and comes back and swaps our menu again back to the original one. Dinner in the globe restaurant was nice. Service was good and food was excellent.

We are leaving in the morning, so will have to fork out another €6 to get the car out. We stayed in a hotel a year ago in the centre of Dublin, with our car and parking was supplied free of charge, that’s why I’m making a big deal of the fee.

Overall, the staff are pleasant, trying hard and doing their best, but I think the management perhaps and the systems and processes in place are failing them.",3,2019,06,04
249,Trip,"Just like to take a moment to review globe bar, I visited the hotel last week. Rooms were ok in need of a slight face lift. Reception staff pleasent. But the pride of the hotel should be the bar,  all i can say is the service in the bar was fantastic. Staff so friendly specially natalie and ina made me feel welcome and at home.",4,2019,05,31
249,Function in the bar,"Hi I visited the globe bar for a double communion/confirmation party the room was layed out perfectly very comfortable,the food was lovely and the service from baby faced Kevin was amazing very polite and easy to talk to will definitely be booking here again.",5,2019,05,31
249,Exceptional Staff And Service,"We checked in yesterday and from the moment we got to the desk we had nothing but smiles and kindness from a lovely well put young lad""Eoghan"" we got there a little before check in time but they tried their very best to accommodate us..The Front Office Manager ""Ramona"" greeted us and made sure the check in went smoothly and not to mention that she gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Superior Suite to ensure a comfortable stay the room was really spacious and super comfortable we even had our own balcony from Check in till check out everything went pleasantly smooth we definitely had a great stay and we will revisit in the future.",4,2019,05,31
249,Awful ,"This is the second time I have stayed here now, the first time was a normal hotel room, but last night they put me in a “suite”. The building is separate to the hotel, it smells awful the carpets are filthy dirty, frayed, and there was rubbish on the floor. The room was not even painted properly. The lift stinks. The atmosphere does not feel safe and easy. €135 for the privilege.. would not recommend. ",1,2019,05,30
249,Food service,"I had to take their names down because of the warmth they gave me. Irina, Ramona and Piyvsh👏👏👏❤️❤️. Thank you for your hospitality and service. Your smile while serving us the good food was incredible. I loved staying at the hotel and i’d Recommend anyone visiting Dublin to book in advance as the hotel normally full. Will be coming back soon as I always feel at home there. I loved my stay 💯💯",5,2019,05,30
249,Dublin Zoo / Hotel Stay  ,"Hi, Dont normally write reviews but felt compelled to do so after a lovely break away with the family at the Clayton Hotel. Room was great, food was excellent and the staff are a credit to the hotel. Couldn't do enough for you and nothing to much of an ask. Always smiling ( makes a huge difference) when with a young family and always engaging.
Pool is a bit dated and locks can be bought at reception for lockers but if you leave valuables in your free room safe no issues.  Overall I'd happily stay here again and again with the family.

",5,2019,05,29
249,Pool is a health hazzard,"Just back from short break in the hotel and had great time with the family. Couldn’t fault hotel and staff were a credit to themselves. One negative would be the club vitae leisure centre. You need to see it to believe it😲 the dirt, rubbish lying everywhere, locket doors hanging off, staff just grunt at you. Enter at your own risk. No excuse for being dirty. It would be a environmental health issue. Disgusting🤢",3,2019,05,28
249,Will stay again,"Stayed here recently and got checked in by Zoe - Great service and very welcoming - Even though she was new helped us out in every way she could.

Very spacious room and clean.

249,Nice hotel,"We stayed as part of a tour group. Room was quite spacious with a little table and sitting area as well as a desk. No air conditioning though, you have to open the windows for some air. High bath to climb over to have a shower which seems to be the norm. Nice open wardrobe for hanging up clothes. Lifts were a bit slow and congested. There was a nice coffee shop in the hotel where you could order take away food.",4,2019,05,25
249,Avoid,"Car park is not included in price of hotel. 
One would expect car park to be secure. Just returned from a stay here to have my number plates stolen from the underground car park. 
Received no satisfaction from management. Will not be staying here again.",1,2019,05,22
249,Lovely Place ,"Stayed here recently, family of 4. 

Plenty of room in the family room. 2 single & 1 double bed. 

Breakfast buffet has plenty of choice and staff are very good at refilling the food area. 

Loads of choice on the buffet menu, hot & cold food.

Bar area has plenty of seating in it and kids were welcome. 

All guest have use of the pool and leisure centre.

Food & Drinks prices very reasonable.

Short walk to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre for both shops and restaurants (if you don’t want to eat at hotel)

Underground secure car park @ €6 per day.

Also has some EV charge points.

Overall a nice hotel that we would recommend.

249,Staff praise,"Hotel is lovely. Would especially like to thank Owen at reception. He was so kind and helpful. We would nearly stay here again just cause of him. 
He is a credit to the team. 
 We loved the leisure center also. Great Jacuzzi.",5,2019,05,17
249,Great breakfast experience,Recently stayed at this hotel on a business trip. The usual self serve breakfast foods that you loaded onto you plate. The food wasn't extronanory but good. What made the breakfast experience outstanding was a couple of staff. Sharon was very friends and helpful and was very willing to assist however she could. The assistant manager Ivo was just as helpful. He is working full time and attending college. Thank you both for being a positive influence on my start to the day. Clayton hotel Liffey Valley are lucky to have you. Good luck in what ever you decide to do next.,4,2019,05,17
249,Absolutely Terrible.,The only thing going from this place is the semi comfortable beds. Have stayed here three times on different occasions and in different years and have tried to give them the benefit of doubt. The staff are very very rude with no care or attention to any paying customers. The corridors are miles long so wear walking shoes on checkin. The car park is a joke to try and get in and out of. Food could only be rated as average as well as the service a simple smile or hello can go a long way. As with previous reviews on here someone will respond with and apology and a fake promise that the hotel will preform better but don’t waste your time responding to this as I will never ever return.,1,2019,05,17
249,Good Value but poor service,"Have visited this hotel on a number of occasions and we have always loved it. However,  we have noticed the service and cleanliness and declined in our last 2 visits.  Stayed here a few weeks ago - price was great value for a family room and is ideal for a night away with the kids as there is a pool.  However, the cleanliness of the restaurant for dinner was very disappointing. 3 out of 4 of the glasses on our table were dirty and the cutlery was dirty - the restaurant looked like it needed a deep clean and a bit of updating. The food however was very good. Service from the manager in the restaurant was very good but the waiting staff were extremely unfriendly. 
As for the manager in the bar, I have never seen such an ignorant woman and was appalled at the way she spoke to her staff.  Service at the bar was extremely slow even though there was more staff behind the bar than waiting to be served as it was a quiet night. At one point, she was screaming at one of the waitress and being very smart to her which was very embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch.  
Apart from the good value, the overall stay was a bit of a disappointment and will probably try a different the next time we visit Dublin",3,2019,05,16
249,Stayed 2 nights on business,"Stayed for 2 nights in May on business. 

Slight problem checking in as the receptionist could not find my booking but was quickly resolved after I was able to show them the confirmation email.  Couldnt fault the staff at all during my stay.

Room itself was nice enough, nothing spectacular.  Bed arent particularly comfortable and the room was ridiculously warm at night even with the window open and fan on; ended up perching the fan on the bedside table to be able to sleep.  

Odd numbered rooms back on to a dual carriageway which can be heard through the windows, some soundproofing upgrades are definitely needed.",4,2019,05,16
249,Avoid,"It's all good when everything goes well , however the slightest little problem and they certainly do not go out of their way to resolve . They are not responsive , unhelpful and simply do not care  about guests . Clearly the hospitality business  is not theirs ...
Avoid at all costs .",1,2019,05,14
249,Highly recommend for meetings/conferences,We often use the Clayton for conferences and have found Helena and her team to be more than helpful in accommodating our needs. Lunch is always lovely and the staff are always on hand if there are any technical glitches!,5,2019,05,13
249,Good coach trip stop,"Large well organised hotel. Rooms are a good size with good facilities. Had an issue with the room TV, phoned reception and within a few minutes two people arrived to sort it out - excellent service. As on a coach trip w3 had a limited menu evening meal but the food was very good, as was the service. Excellent buffet breakfast with a very good selection of hot and cold food. Spent two excellent nights there.",5,2019,05,12
249,Italian restaurant,"I dine in the main restaurant often and i love the food and the staff. The breakfast service is fantastic. The dinner food could use more options, but overall its very tasty. Staff makes me feel at home - in particular Ivo and Oana",5,2019,05,11
249,may,"very nice hotel. bar and reception staff are nice, but i have to single out the restaurant. Breakfast is wonderful, staff are ao nice, Ivo and Mahen in particular. I would easily recommend ans return.",5,2019,05,08
249,Clayton Liffey valley,"Hotel is lovely.i am a frequent visitor and I love it here. Ivo looks after me very well at breakfast.he is very accomodating and all staff are just great.i should also mention mahen from dinner, as he is very good also.",5,2019,05,08
249,Consistently good,"I travel to Dublin every month and always stay at the Clayton at Liffey Valley.  The beds are very large and comfortable, the staff are lovely and the rooms always clean and bright.
The gym and pool are really useful but not too busy.
Over the road is a large shopping centre and cinema which is great for a night out or just a meal.",4,2019,05,08
249,CSF group,"Stayed with a group of 44. Very well looked after. No fuss, Efficient, friendly, great hospitality, food excellent, service excellent, very positive and enjoyable experience. We had the use of dining facilities, meeting room facilities, pool and leisure centre facilities, rooms - all very positive.",1,2019,05,08
249,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here Easter Sunday, the hotel was very busy. The staff were very nice, food was gorgeous, beds were so comfortable and it was fantastic value for money. Good location. Very nice swimming pool. Spotlessly clean.",5,2019,05,07
249,Car parking only - excellent,"We only booked the parking so our use of the hotel itself was fleeting. The cost of fuel for the drive from Belfast plus the parking at Dublin airport was comparable to the cost of parking at Belfast International or Belfast City, and the flight times were more convenient. We pre-booked and the car was recognised on arrival. We waited maybe 10 minutes at 3:30am for the next bus to the airport. On our return the bus was waiting so we were back at the car within 15 minutes of reclaiming our baggage. Unfortunately my car wouldn't start, so I returned to reception and asked them to call a recovery vehicle. The receptionist, despite some language difficulties, asked why, and said the hotel could do a jump start. We waited about 10 minutes for the car park attendant, whereas a recovery would have been probably over an hour and maybe €100. The attendant was very helpful and got us on our way. Excellent service, and we weren't even ""proper"" guests.",5,2019,05,07
249,Great hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions, most recent stay was at the weekend. It ticks the box every time, clean facilities, good breakfast and friendly staff throughout housekeeping, pool,bar, restaurant and in particular reception. Special thanks to Helen at reception for handling the one small issue we had.",4,2019,05,07
249,Great trip,"Thought I’d take the time to write a review as it’s well deserved!!! Staff are brilliant and cannot do enough to help from the reception to the bar to the pool, we only planned on staying one night after a trip to the zoo but couldn’t help our selves to stay another night so we booked online and when we arrived silly us booked 2 adults and forgot to book the children 🤦🏾‍♀️😂 so any ways we meet a member of staff named Helen at reception and she was able to sort our problem within minutes no fuss or hassle 💖 our trip has been Amazing and we will 1000000% be back to stay again , great hotel for families or couples, thank you xxx",5,2019,05,06
249,Great hotel,We booked a last minute trip here in April for 2adults and 2kids and I must say the hotel staff were just amazing. The room was clean and spacious. The bed was so comfortable I had the best nites sleep. The breakfast was great had a great selection. We ate in the bar for dinner and the food was just lovely couldn’t fault a thing. The pool in the hotel was so warm the kids just loved it. ,5,2019,05,01
249,Great Spot!,Very good hotel. Good location. Special mention to Sharon in the breakfast dining area who was very kind and offered us a bag to take pastries for the day ahead. Very nice lady and with staff like this it would encourage us to return. Great pool area also,5,2019,05,01
249,Holiday stay,The hotel is good for families the pool is good but the bar staff and reception are slow and never follow up on what they said they would and to get a bill for parking after 4 days and eating in the hotel was a joke ,2,2019,04,25
249,Easter break,OK here we go for another amazing Clayton experience...hotel great as always value for money fantastic and can I just say that we have just had a meal at gusto and food was lovely but what made it a complete enjoyment was the hostess Oana who could not have done enough for me and my family....this woman made a dining experience a delight...thank you so much and because of her we will be back again...Ali Douglas,5,2019,04,25
249,easter break away,Nice hotel but extremely busy. Great location for liffey vally shopping centre. hotel way to warm especially down at bar was like a sauna.Bar service very slow. Breakfast was only ok was not very hot actually luke warm at best. Coffee was filled already made in airpots  (absolute pet hate of mine yuk). Breakfast staff so busy,3,2019,04,25
249,Lovely food,Had lunch today food was amazing and the two sharons were lovely to deal with and such nice girls will definitely be back again nice relaxing lunch and very pleasent staff would recommend this place for lunch,5,2019,04,25
249,The breakfast,I really loved the breakfast it was really good and the server was very nice and he always checked in with us and asked if everything was alright his name was Oisín. The space that I ate breakfast in was really clean and I liked that it was included with the hotel and also I liked that it was buffet style,5,2019,04,25
249,Hotel Stay was great!,"The service was amazing at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley. I enjoyed every part of my stay. The food was delicious, especially breakfast! Amazing servers at breakfast especially Oisin! Can not wait till my next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,04,25
249,Average enough. ,"Staying here at the minute. Just an average hotel. Have to pay in full on arrival before seeing the room if you “only have a Visa card” rooms in need of a revamp. Cracked plaster, stained and ripped carpet. Staff very friendly but food seems to be slow leaving kitchen. Breakfast good and hotel kid friendly. Food good but pricey. €3.50 for a regular tea. Also seems to be a lot of non nationals living in hotel... ",3,2019,04,24
249,Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in,We checked into the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley in the early morning to drop our luggage into our room. We payed at the reception for our room the receptionist gave use our card to put into the door of the room. The card did not work we went down to the reception area again with it and all they did said  that they would get the manager to look at it. We went back up to the room again card still would not open the door two cleaning staff tryed to open the door with the card and there own keys one of the cleaners rang down to reception for use. But when we went down to tell them that the cleaner rang down to them about this issue they made lyers out of use and laughed at use. In the end they give use a double room a different number room when we wanted a twin room. I will never ever stay in this  hotel again. Rudest people I have ever meet. And you have to pay a deposit of 100 euro for a room I did not reserve. Will never be back..,1,2019,04,21
249,Visiting Family & Dublin,"Our room was better than we could have expected. Perfect accommodations for 2 adults/1 child. The breakfast buffet each morning was excellent, not to mention the service from our server SHARON! She greeted us with a big smile each morning and couldn't do enough to help us enjoy our morning. Kudos to the hotel for having such a great staff member!!! We enjoyed a dinner in Gustos one night and drinks at the bar a couple of nights. One afternoon we enjoyed a cup of tea with barista JESS who offered to help us finish off our day with great suggestions!!! She took the time to write down her suggestions even letting us know which bus to catch into Dublin. It was a perfect plan and we could not wait to see her the next day to offer our thanks!!!! Sometimes it is just the little things that make the most difference. Nice job Clayton Hotel! Your staff is wonderful. 
Our only frustration was the heat in our room. It was extremely warm and housekeeping was not able to help. They gave us a fan and that did help. 
Location is perfect and the Airport Hopper is awesome. Highly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2019,04,19
249,Great venue for company events,"We use the Clayton on a regular basis for meetings & conferences as it's in such a great location. The conference facilities work well for smaller meetings as well as for larger events and the staff are always on hand to provide any help should you require it.

249,Very much an airport hotel on an industrial park,"It’s a functional hotel, but very much just an airport style hotel on an industrial park. Checking in quite slow, amenities ok but bland, but does the job just about with no frills . I wouldn’t book it again unfortunately. ",3,2019,04,16
249,Great friendly hotel .,"This is my second review on this friendly hotel , the last one been in 2017 , again a very warm welcome on arrival from Payel who happened to be on reception again checking us in - she assigned us such a nice suite - lovely and quiet and spacious , had a perfect night sleep , We had dinner in the restaurant where we had friends join us for dinner it was excellent once again , breakfast was excellent also and set us up for the day ahead.  Once again many thanks for a wonderful night stay and I would like to nominate Payel for  the employee of the month award - its great to see someone loving their job and making the guests feel so welcome . Great hotel with great facilities .",5,2019,04,15
249,Very unhappy,"After reading all the great reviews we booked the Clayton Hotel as a treat for our son's confirmation. What a disappointment. 
The room was ok well laid out for family but the dirt of the carpet was discusting. Tiles were cracked in the shower. Staff were very nice. View from our room was of homeless people living in a tent. 
Also extra charge for secure carpark wasn't stated before we checked in. 
Over all very disappointed with our stay.",1,2019,04,14
249,Breakfast experience,"My son and I are currently staying at the Clayton Hotel. We have always had great breakfast for the past month we have been here. There's a wide selection to pick from, it caters to everybody's taste really. The staff are warm and welcoming. One of the staff that particularly stands out for us is Binta, she has been very consistent with her excellent customer service. She gives us a ""home away from home"" feel, ever smiling and happy to help. Thank you Binta, you have contributed positively to our stay here at Clayton....kudos to you👌👌",5,2019,04,12
249,Home from home,"I stay at the Clayton regularly and each time I visit the experience is always welcoming and friendly. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, the food is fantastic but what makes it special is the staff who always go above and beyond, in particular I’d have to say Natalie and Nadine in reservations are worth their weight in gold. If you are looking for a great Dublin hotel then don’t pass it by.",5,2019,04,11
249,First class,"Had a full day business meeting in the hotel. Both Sharon's in the restaurant were first class. The service and food  was excellent and the we were looked after very well.
Diana and her team at the meeting rooms area were also great and really looked after us. Definitely using this hotel again",5,2019,04,10
249,Lovely hotel,"Recently I visited this hotel with my friend driking coffee in the morning,it was very nice,i will be back.thanks to leo and jess in the cafe.the room is quite new,the staff here is perfect,i like the bar food as well,it is kind of asian food,and lot of choice for drinks,me and my friend really enjoyed our stay.",4,2019,04,08
249,busy well equipped hotel,"Rooms are spacious, breakfast buffet with friendly staff. 
There are two restaurants a bar style and an Italian however the Italian was closed all week except for a conference guests. There is a nice chinese fusion restaurant next door which is good value. The car park is controlled. Local shops and restaurants in the nearby retail park however walking around at night is not recommended/.",4,2019,04,07
249,Conference room booking,"I regularly hold training days in the Clayton. I can’t fault the lads for the service they provide.

Keith was taking care of us on Saturday and Daniel was on duty on the Sunday.

Thanks a mil lads,
See yous next next.",5,2019,04,07
249,Super family hotel,"Stayed for 1 night in family room. Everything about hotel was positive. Very friendly staff, all facilities very clean. Family room not cramped. Good food. Everyone great with kids. Fabulous breakfast. Will def return st some stage. ",5,2019,04,07
249,NOT a 4 star hotel,"I booked this hotel for our first two nights in Dublin. It was labeled a 4 star hotel, had an indoor pool, and had a good rate on a family room (we were traveling with our two children.) This is NOT a 4 star hotel. I'm not even sure I'd call it a 3 star hotel. The beds were decently comfortable and clean, but that's about all the praise I've got. My kids love a hotel pool, and after days of walking and sightseeing, I wanted them to be able to burn off their energy in the evenings at the pool. However, the pool closes or becomes part of the fitness club (I didn't quite understand the explanation given to my husband) and they were unable to use it. The carpet in our room was hideous. I wouldn't even allow my kids to walk on it barefoot and really didn't want my suitcases touching it. The shower head was not adjustable and only sprayed out in a hard single stream of water that was quite uncomfortable. There was no air conditioning so we had to keep the window open. Our room faced the parking lot so we heard everything. I'm not sure they used any insulation in the walls because we also heard everything from the rooms on either side of us and the hallway. This did not make for restful sleep after jet lag. Overall this was not a pleasant experience and I would not stay here again.",2,2019,04,06
249,What a lovely hotel ,Hi is me mr mustafe I am here to express my feeling about Clayton hotel I really loved it the hotel nice people clean need and good personality staff I will came back soon specially I will miss the service I had when I came down for breakfast Oana helped me and I love her services many thanks to staff manager and the managements off hotel ,4,2019,04,05
249,Wonderful Stay,My wife and I stay regularly at the Clayton. We especially like the breakfast. Ivo and Sharon always know how to make us feel comfortable and as if we are at home. They are both very professional and friendly and they just cannot do enough for you.,5,2019,04,03

249,Paddy’s day stay,"I stayed here on paddy’s day and it was amazing. The rooms were lovely and the breakfast was fantastic, the staff were great especially Andrew Ann’s the food was perfect. The hotel is very close to the city centre which was great. I will stay here again next time I’m in Ireland",5,2019,04,03
249,NIce Hotel,"Location is handy for the airport & the room rate makes up for the taxi's needed to get into town. My taxi  is a useful app 

The rooms are large & beds comfortable.

The staff (kevin on desk) & breakfast are very good.",4,2019,04,02
249,What a breakfast ,"We visited a few weeks ago and I don’t normally comment but the service we had here left me no other option but to do so. From the moment we walked in until we left we had a unbelievable experience, the service was fantastic, the atmosphere in the bar was the reason why I didn’t feel the best each morning as I probably stayed too long. I am leaving the best part to the last, the breakfast was unbelievable, the secret of my daily recovery from too my Guinness the previous night. Thank you to everyone, we will certainly be back again 🇬🇧. ",5,2019,04,01
249,hope event,"Just want to say how great our hope event went last night in our hotel the room looked amazing and the three lads working it Jamie M&E Manager and the two other lads Daniel and Jack they did everything to make our night great looked after us really well with the food, drinks and helping out with laptop for slide shows I wasn't going to come to the event cause i was coming from cork but I'm so happy I did now because it was a brilliant night can't wait to come back again",5,2019,03,31
249,Amazing service,"Jack, Daniel and Andrew were very helpful during our staying at Clayton hotel. We really appreciate the kindness of the staff! I recommend this place to stay for a few days in Dublin. Trust us on this!!!",5,2019,03,30
249,Staff,"Jack, Daniel and Andrew are the best staff. The function was amazing and the drinks were the best. The customer service is the best and staff so friendly and did everything right on the day so good ..",5,2019,03,30

I will come back and request their services personally they are so nice and have great customer skills,5,2019,03,30
249,"Noisy (again) - didn't sleep - due to this was worst ever hotel stay - lifts very far from some rooms, food average","Stayed with my mother and son, room had interconnecting doors(double set) but doors must have been of poor paper like quality as we could hear TV and kids laughing from next door late that night and the family next door weren't even terribly noisy.  We managed to sleep by focusing on tuning out the noise and did get some sleep but it did start again next morning.  On leaving though I asked for parking ticket to be validated and thought I had paid for same, as I approached the exit ramp the ticket did not work, it was stressful and annoying asking the cars behind me who also ready and lined up to exit,to reverse so I could leave to go and get the ticket sorted.  When I went back to reception to get ticket sorted I was annoyed enough at this point to complain about the noise, the receptionist at least listened and acknowledged the noise and suggested an upgrade if we re-booked.  Which we did and were, as promised, given an upgrade to an executive  suite.  We had booked a room with double and single bed, in the suite there were two rooms, one with super large and comfy bed to be fair, the other room with small leather sofa.  We went to reception to ask where the single bed was, we were moved then to another suite, which was exactly the same as the first suite, so we went to reception again to ask where the single bed was.  We were told the leather sofa was a sofa bed, which was fine to some extent though I don't know why they just didn't tell us this in the first room.  The move was therefore unnecessary and annoying. Reception said someone would be up in 5-10 mins to make up the sofa bed, it was well over an hour before someone came and it wasn't that comfy.  Lifts also long way from some of rooms, stained floor in one  room, bin on one room only, plug in bath really hard to get out.  These are only small things and I wouldn't have minded if i didn't have the noise problem again.  Again the room had interconnecting doors, this time there was a bunch of lads next door, not terribly noisy but louder than our neigbours on previous stay.  Had felt silly packing earplugs as I was sure it wouldn't happy again but glad I brought them as my son couldn't get to sleep without them.  Well after 1am when I finally fell asleep, tried tuning them out but it was just too loud.  Woke much later to...what i can only say were noises i am glad my young son wasn't awoken by. Felt uncomfortable and tired.  Complained next morning to management, manager said he would ring my that week, though i didn't ask him to, he simply insisted he would.  Though he never rang.(so I don't know why he bothered making such a bid deal about ringing me in the first place given that I didn't ask him to, in fact I didn't ask for anything).. he offered late checkout but I had three hour drive ahead and I was just exhausted.  My son was dissapointed as we had planed to go to pool early that morning before leaving but i was too tired to bring him.  I see other complaints about noise and those paper doors on review sites, I see management responding in various ways.. but its all meaningless to me if the complaints keep happening... I don't consider myself a light sleeper and think getting a nights sleep is a fairly BASIC expectation of any stay.  worst stay ever....and I stay in a lot of hotels... management need to demonstrate a bigger commitment to customers by actually doing something about those doors ....for this to happen twice isn't good enough....",2,2019,03,30
249,Conference Facility,"I delivered a training course in the hotel in March 2019. The room was well set up when I arrived, and the conference officer (Jack) was most helpful throughout the day. He sorted out a problem with the projector/laptop connection, was flexible and efficient in terms of refreshments, the room was thoroughly refreshed over lunch, and he checked in with me at the end of the day too! Thanks!",4,2019,03,28
249,Great hotel,"Just had a very pleasant three night stay at the clayton liffey valley rooms, food and staff all great, special mention for Ceiran and the 2 Sharon's for looking after all our needs. Many thanks William and the boys. ",5,2019,03,28
249,Dirty,"Standards have seriously dropped since a couple of years ago. The staff were friendly but theres only so much that they can make up for and in the end, nice staff cant compensate for not having a good, clean, comfortable stay. The rooms were filthy(see pics). I dropped something behind the beside table and when I moved it, there was food, dust and stains behind it. The lamp switches were filthy, the toilet hadnt been cleaned, the curtains were dirty and had cigarette burns and the one chair in the room was badly stained. The shower head was coated in white stuff and didnt work properly although it was replaced after we reported it. The toilet bowl hadnt been cleaned. We were also placed in a room over the function room even though it was known that we had young kids and when that noise stopped then the noise from the hall and rooms was ridiculous. The walls were like paper, we could hear somebody snoring and I’m not sure what type of guest this hotel is used to but the people in the room next to us actually looked through and ate our left over room service food that we had put outside to be collected. The family room was just a double room with extra beds and a desk with only one hard chair for four people. The room service menu had a deal for family of 2 adults and two kids. Pity we had nowhere to eat it. The lobby and public areas were very clean so the state of the room was a shock. We werent asked about our stay at check out but to be honest after two nights of no sleep we were just happy to leave.",1,2019,03,26
249,Excellent coffee and service by the Barista Leo,"Highly recommend the coffee in the Red Bean Roastery in the foyer of the hotel. The Barista Leo is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and provides excellent service, a credit to the company be sure to grab a coffee here from Leo.",5,2019,03,25
249,St. Patrick's Day in Croke Park,We always go to Croke Park for the All Ireland Club Finals on the 17th March. This year we booked  into the Clayton Hotel in Liffey Valley. The receptionist was a young lad called Kevin and he was very helpful indeed. Everything was perfect for us and Kevin was there again in the morning to check us out ( Good Lad our Kevin )! We enjoyed our short visit once again.,5,2019,03,19

We had such a fabulous time, the staff were excellent, the rooms were big and very clean and the best part of all was the breakfast we had.

249,Excellent Staff & Breakfast,"Staff esp management were top class and very helpful. Lovely coffee corner in front lobby. The breakfast in the morning was exceptional!! Will definitely be back. Great location, so close to Liffey Valley.",5,2019,03,13
249,Paying for parking is ridiculous,"Visited this hotel for a weekend and spent there 3 nights. It was just ok, wouldn't say that it deserves for 4* as I visited 3* hotels with better standard. The biggest plus for profesional staff, very friendly, nice and helpful. The biggest minus for hotel parking. You pay for accommodation and then extra €6 everyday for parking I've never seen something like that especially in 4* hotel, unacceptable! Every time when You leave parking You need to ask for special ticket to not pay again. Don't know if I come back there as I can get better option with free parking from different hotels.",3,2019,03,10
249,Excellent Breakfast! ,Stayed in this hotel last February and I found it faultless! Excellent breakfast options with a very warm hospitality received from Adrian Foy and his team. Superb stay indeed! Looking forward on my return to this lovely place. ,5,2019,03,10
249,Breakfast,"The breakfast at they Clayton hotel in Liffey valley was greatly enjoyed by all our family, there was a fantastic selection between the continental breakfast as well as the hot buffet. All the food was freshly produced and hot and tasty. The idea of heating the plates was very clever ! There was great service abc Binta was particularly friendly and helpful.",5,2019,03,10
249,Great Location and impressive Hotel not far into city!,"Just completing a 2 nights stay here and have to say the experience has been very pleasant. I have read many negative reviews on here but i have not had the same experience. I called ahead at the hotel and requested a room that was not interconnecting and also no children running about in corridors they was very helpful and placed me on the lower floor and i have heard no noise at all! From inside or outside the hotel.
Amenities: there are restaurants inside the hotel you can dine in however we went out and about so i can not comment on the food. Bar is situated in the hotel also we had 2 pints of Guiness which came to €10.10 not at all bad! There is a pool sauna and Jacuzzi which is open mon to fri till 9pm no kids after 7pm and sat and sun till 7:30pm the pool is very big and kept clean! There was no locker available when we went in but we kept valuables in our room.
The Rooms: i booked a superior double room it was very spacious very clean and has the most amazing black out curtains! Bed was super comfy pillows you have two and lots of cushions! Duvet lovley and thick to keep you warm :)) the Bathroom was spacious includes a bath tub and a shower head water not staying hot for very long but this hotel has over 500 rooms so if you all shower the same time you can not expect hot water for ages! The room also had a fridge that you can put your drinks into. a TV that has freeview english channels on it hairdryer stand alone heater which we did not need to use at all duvet kept us very warm! 
Transport links: the liffey valley shopping centre is a 5-10min walk away where here you can jump on buses into dublin city centre and the Guiness storehouse as we did! Bus takes around 35-40 mins. We took the number 40 into st james watling street where you stop right outside the Guiness storehouse! €3 single per adult not sure on kids price! We then got the number 26 back from temple bar in the city again €3 single and this took 35 mins back to liffey valley!.
Liffey valley itself is huge and has alot of places to dine! TGI Fridays nandos lots of places to eat! Also across from the hotel is thai restaurant LemonGrass and food is stunning! 

I would chose to stay at this hotel again based on my experience the location the price the transport links are all positives and the reception staff very helpful also!

249,Needs improving ,"Unfortunately I cannot be too positive about this hotel. Stayed one night for business to check if it would be good enough for a large group stay in April. First impression wasn’t good, had to wait at least 15 minutes to even check in, there just isn’t enough check in desks for the size hotel. I was happy to let that go but the other, what I would say bigger let down was the lack of hot water in both mine and my colleagues rooms. Neither of us could have a bath and the water was just about bearable for a shower. I decided to mention it on check out,  but you’ve guessed it, the queue at the desk was huge and we had to be somewhere. If you like waiting and don’t care about hot water then everything else about this hotel is great. It’s close to lots of restaurants and cinema, so not all bad ",3,2019,03,07
249,Great location and facilities for Meeting & Events,"Very positive experience with the Clayton Hotel in Liffey Valley this week. We held 2 days training here.  The room was well laid out to our previously discussed needs, and bright with a large amount of natural sunlight (very important when in the room all day).  A few things stood out
- Quality - from the biscuits at break, to the lunch provided, the quality was excellent.
- Service - Diane looked after us, and was very attentive and proactive.  
- Location - great spot to gather individuals across Dublin.  Free carparking.",5,2019,03,06
249,Great Staff,"We have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions and the last two times in particular we met Kevin at reception. He was very friendly and accommodating and we cannot praise him highly enough. 
Great staff and great location",5,2019,03,04
249,Average hotel,Stayed for 3 nights on a business trip. Room was average not particularly clean room. Milk was off in the cartons in my room and my colleagues. My other colleague had to ask for her bathroom to be cleaned. Walls are extremely thin which makes you feel like you’re sharing with the people next door. Very poor nights sleep on all three nights as hotel is so noisy. Limited lounge area. When trying to sit somewhere quiet in the hotel there are people and families coming in and out as they use the leisure facilities there. Will not be staying here again,3,2019,03,04
249,Super tasty Prawns;) friendly professional staff !,"I stayed for 2 night with my 2 kids  and must say we really enjoyed stay.  Beds were super  comftible. Delicious food  and fantastic service. Especially super tasty PRAWNS! OMG the best I had in my life :)  a Big Thank you to a  waiter AJAI for his great profesional service! Outstanding attitude!  And a lady called OANA fantastic personality , verry friendly and helpful! We enjoyed our stay a lot! Definitely will be back!
Thank You",4,2019,03,03
249,This hotel has gone down over the past few years,We arrived at 6pm and our room still wasn't ready. We were given another room and the window frame was so bad even with the window closed the room was very cold with a bad breeze coming in. This wasn't the end of the world as we closed the curtains. The kids wanted to watch tv but it wouldn't turn on and  none of the sockets had power!. I went to reception and talked to the receptionist where I was rudely interrupted by another member of staff. We were upgraded so a suite ( they knew there were 2 adults and 2 children) which was great until we went to the room and there was only a double bed. So my son and I had to sleep on the couch. we did get blankets and pillows but no covers on the blankets or pillows.. overall a very bad experience and we will not stay there again.,2,2019,03,03
249,Beds hard like a prison.,"Oh dear where to start! Beds so hard a prison would have been more comfortable. Noise from rooms next door was too loud. Child friendly swimming pool is quite the opposite. Staff at restaurant were very unhelpful to my partner and her child resulting in her having to drive to a local McDonald's. Finally they charge you a premium for parking in their OWN carpark as a guest. One thing is consistent with Clayton for me, terrible each time. My partner booked on this occasion. Had it have been me I would have avoided to begin with given previous experiences.",1,2019,03,03
249,Mr. B,"I stayed for one night on business and I must say that I will definately be back. Big shout out to all the staff who made my stay great. Service was excellent, couldn't fault anything. And breakfast was perfect, well done with this. Just what I needed in the morning before my meetings. Would recommend this hotel to any friends or colleagues staying in the city.",5,2019,03,03
249,Spring Cleaning or is it?,"This must be a first in my years of traveling for work or indeed relaxation. Many thanks to the hotel for such a clean and pleasant room. Perhaps housekeeping forget to replace the table and chairs, an oversight maybe but one that signifies the adoption of a much lower class of service. The Clarion brand commanded strength, the Clayton, please enlighten me so u can believe in the brands attention to customer detail and satisfaction. I await. ",2,2019,02,28
249,Friendly staff,I have stayed here several times over the last few years. Natalie in the bar / restaurant is always friendly and does a great job. Sharon and Ivo in the restaurant are always pleasant and friendly and ensure everyone is looked after. Kevin on reception desk is always very polite and helpful. Rooms need AC for the hotter weather. ,4,2019,02,27
249,Staff make difference,"Having just checked out I would just like to stay the reception staff were definitely the highlight in particular a young man named Kevin,  who made our stay so much easier.  His pleasant demeanor, and going the extra mile makes all the difference and hope the senior management takes note. Having worked in hotels in a previous life and now working from the other side,  reception is the first and last impression of any establishment. The hotel is always good for as family visit, with good food and pool close to shopping and cinema.  Would also like a special mention for Chris as well,  again very sociable and going the extra bit.  Looking forward to coming back again.",5,2019,02,24
249,Staff so helpful and pleasant,"I arrived at this hotel to find that the charger for my laptop had been damaged in the hold on the flight over from Manchester.
I took this to reception and left it with them for half an hour, hoping they would be able to straighten one of the prongs on the plug, which had been bent.
Unfortunately, they were unable to do so, but to my huge gratitude, they replaced the whole plug.  I was overjoyed as this was imperative to the success of my business trip.  As far as overall service goes, Oana was extremely pleasant and helpful.",5,2019,02,22
249,Family break ,"Stayed here with my family for 2 nights and I am glad we didn't take any notice of some of the reviews about this hotel. We were able to check in from 2pm which, although there was a queue, didn't take too long. The hotel is fairly big and we were given a room on the ground floor near to the movie room and kids play area. The family room was spacious and clean. Only downside was we couldn't control the heating like in other hotels we've stayed in but it is only a minor gripe. The bathroom, although a bit tired looking, had plenty of toiletries and towels. We had a small issue on our first evening but after speaking to the duty manager it was soon sorted out and drinks were then sent to our room as a gesture of goodwill. 
Breakfast on both mornings was superb with Sharon making sure we were made to feel very welcome (she should be commended for her friendliness and knowledge of the local area). 
I can't comment on the hotel restaurant (Globe Bar and Restaurant was the only one opened during our stay anyway) because a short stroll brings you to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre where places like TFI Fridays, Cosmo and Nandos are located so instead of eating in the hotel we ate here.
All in all we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend it to our family and friends.",5,2019,02,19
249,Screaming teens,"Stayed here for 1 night on the way to the airport, was put in a room next to a bunch of teenage girls from a sports team who were running up and down the halls all night, screaming at eachother. Sounded like there was 10 of them in the room at any time of the night. Shower in bathroom leaked everywhere as well, will not be back here.",2,2019,02,16
249,Weekend stay,"Stayed here in January for one night. Hotel was easy to find and had plenty of parking out front also with an underground car park that was safe and secure. 
Our check in was quick and friendly and the room was very spacious for a standard double room. The bed was very comfortable we had a great nights sleep. We used the pool too which was fantastic although it was a busy time when we went. There is a jacuzzi there we didn’t get the chance to use it as it was busy. 
The shower in the room was not great it was like a high pressure hose which was kind of sore. 
They also had a little play area for kids which is a great idea for families. 
Location was ideal with the Liffey valley shopping centre just across the road would advise leaving car at hotel and walking over (5 min walk) as the shopping centre car park is very busy and hard to find spaces. 
Plenty of options for food in the shopping centre too. 
Great value for money we got a very good room only price for a Saturday night. 
",4,2019,02,16
249,Disappointing ,"We booked this last minute & price wise got a good deal. The hotel was very busy, but staff were friendly. There is a policy that booking the restaurant through reception gets you a discount/ free glass of wine which is a bit strange. The room itself was fine, clean, but not as nice as other Clayton Hotels I have been in. The down side is that soundproofing is very poor, we could hear things being plugged in in the next room like they were in our room, and there was an alarm going off from 7am on the Sunday morning. Toiletries were provided but the bathroom needed refreshing- the floor looked like CSI had been out with luminol. To add to that there were kids running up & down the hallway & making a lot of noise, I’ve no problem with children but we wanted a quiet break. 
We ate in the seated area at the back of the bar, the food was fine - nothing special but overpriced, and this seems to be a Dublin thing. Our server was Tracey who was lovely, very attentive & did a great job! ",2,2019,02,14
249,Excellent Service.,"Staff at the hotel was excellent. Very caring friendly and jolly.
Sharon, Ramona, and Ivo along with all made me feel special.

Would definetly recommend for stay in Dublin.

Clean hotel premises, good rooms nice connectivity near to shopping center And excellent people.",5,2019,02,13
249,Perfect,We stayed here the night before the schools swimming final and it was a perfect location.  Lovely breakfast.   Ideal location    On the m50 so handy for all locations - city centre etc and of course Liffey Valley shopping centre.,5,2019,02,12
249,Rooms bit jaded,Check in was swift but I always have an issue travelling alone and the receptionist announces my room number! The room number is on the key card so no need to tell me or anyone else listening. The room was clean and comfortable. The hallways could do with a refresh the carpet is jaded. The Globe restaurant was great and good value for money. Hotel is in a good location for city and M50 access.,3,2019,02,11
249,Felt like a Hostel - not a 4-star hotel.  Not nice for a Family stay.,"PROS:  Great location.  Good Breakfast.  Nice Pool facilities.
CONS:  Poorly trained staff.  Eateries closed.  6 euro charge for parking.  Not a safe feeling environment, clientele seemed rough and common areas were treated like a sitting room in a hostel.

Stayed here on a Friday night walked through smoke from 4/5 people shivering around an ashtray bin at the front door.  The only smoking area for the bar it would seem.

Pleasant guy welcomed us and checked us in.  We were a family with a young child.  He told us where to find our rooms and the breakfast time. No further information.  I have just found out that there was a kids playground somewhere and other amenities, but was not informed so did not use them.  Other staff not so nice.

Gusto Restaurant that is advertised on the website had a sign saying Closed (8 pm Friday) Food was offered in the Bar area (limited menu). There were a number of different groups in and around the bar.  Some with kids who were running amok, most in their pajamas.  Some adults were walking around in slippers.  After one drink and a bowl of chips we left for bed.

1:30 am we were woken a number of times by noise from what sounded like children in the room next to us, running and screaming.

Paid for a late check-out (30 euro for 3 hours).  Our door was knocked on 3 times by housekeeping to clean it.",2,2019,02,09
249,Will never return here.,On arrival to this Hotel it looked good from the out side but that is where it stoped. We were checked in by a slightly rude and obnoxious blonde haired lady that had more interest in talking to her colleague than make us feel welcome. The rooms are good with the exception of the shower very poor condition for a 4star Hotel. The biggest disappointment of all again for a 4star Hotel is they do not supply room service at breakfast time what is that about. This place won’t have my business again. Also need to give guests a map to there room as very poor signage in long corridors.,1,2019,02,08
249,Great staff,Would just like to say I attended a 30th birthday party on the 2nd of Feb and found all your staff extremely help full and a big thank you to Daniel who was working behind the bar he was an absolute gentleman it's not often you get some one so nice behind a bar that's extremely busy 👏👏,5,2019,02,05
249,Thank you,"My dad has asked me to leave a review to say thank you to the staff working the 30th upstairs on the 2nd. He said though Rachel was learning, she did fantastic and to keep up the good work, Jamie was very welcoming and a huge thank you to Natalie and Andrew in the globe bar for helping them get a taxi to come home. Keep up the great work guys.",5,2019,02,04
249,Pleasantly Surprised,"I’d stayed here when it was run by the Clarion group and swore I’d never return. However I was pleasantly surprised by the Clayton. We checked in late and were upgraded to a suite, which is always a welcome treat. Be prepared for long corridors (a little like a Vegas hotel) and with that in mind better signage is needed. 
Staff were friendly, especially Eoghan at the desk. The breakfast was good, with the exception of the tea and coffee, which stands in large flask type containers and over brews. I asked for green tea and despite a busy restaurant it arrived promptly. The charge for parking, although only €6, was unnecessary and should be forfeited for overnight guests. Room for improvement but a lot better than my last stay in Liffet Valley.",3,2019,02,03
249,Great Team,"Thanks to Dara and the team who pulled out all the stops for a great day. Hotel looked fab.
Conference facilities and set up where great.
Food was 1st Class.
Special mention to Ciaran,Adrian,Derek and Stephen. Will most definitely return.",5,2019,01,31
249,Average,"We have stayed in this hotel many times. The staff used to be so wonderful but on the last few occasions we have found that the standard has really slipped and can be hit or miss. 

We will stay here again as it presents good value for money but there are definitely better places to stay in Dublin.  ",3,2019,01,28
249,Breakfast,"The best breakfast in Ireland! Real Irish breakfast with the best staff that give you a home feeling. Amazing staff- Ivo, Sharon, Ramona and all of them take individual care of each guest. Lovely place ",5,2019,01,26
249,The Staff are what makes this hotel a winner.,"I've stayed in this hotel numerous times in the past 18 months with my partner and also with young nieces and nephews and we've loved it so much it's now become our home away from home especially for our annual Dublin zoo lights trip as a Christmas treat to my nieces and nephews.
But one million percent what makes the hotel for me personally is the staff and in particular I will single out Ivo Todorov at this time. Over the years I've stayed in numerous hotels around the world and all types ranging from hostels to top of the range five star hotels but in my experience Ivo is top class in all areas. His personality and smile are always in top form and his cheery helpful disposition is a joy to watch as he helps all customers in every way he can and I'd observed him working and interacted with him way before he sorted out a problem I had on one of my stays where in error my ""late check-out"" was interrupted 3 times by housekeeping staff. When Ivo found out about this he went above and beyond with upgrading my next stay and other services which truly made my next stay with my niece's and nephews a brilliant experience for them including the complimentary late check out which meant they got another few hours in the pool. His professionalism and manner are amazing to experience and if all staff and management were as good as him in all Clayton hotels then the experiences would always be top class. But overall in all my stays in Clayton liffey valley most staff have been amazing, notably Sharon too at breakfast time. I love this hotel and would not be put off by its out of the way location because in other ways my stays there are always top class and I can't wait to return.",5,2019,01,24
249,Good hotel~! Good breakfast team!!,"I have been staying here for a month. 
I like this hotel..lovely helpful staffs,comfortable room and location..
Most of all, I like breakfast best.
I especially want to thank Ivo and Sharon for kind greeting and bringing me tea every morning^^",4,2019,01,23
249,Mr.ciaran Murphy,Excellent hotel facilities very good friendly staff food was amazing and swimming pool found my stay so relaxing whould highly recommend staying here all around great hotel I stayed with my girlfreind and had a great time Ile be defenetly staying there again and my family have also stayed a couple of times were going back on the 25th for one night all around very friendly and welcoming staff 😁🏨🏊🍱☕🍷🍸,5,2019,01,23
249,Nice hotel for families with children,"Location- The hotel itself is right beside the motorway and inside a sort of industrial estate with car show rooms etc. Although I found it to be relatively quiet. We took a trip to Dublin Zoo which was a 20minute drive from the hotel and would highly recommend if you have children with you (you can buy the tickets on your phone and show the email for fast entry to the zoo, it’s also cheaper). The hotel is a 2 minute drive to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which you can nearly see from the front of the hotel, it has every shop you could think of (Penney’s, M&S, next, cinema (vue), it had loads of restaurants also (check the website for details). We did not venture into Dublin centre so cannot comment on this.

Breakfast- Breakfast was good it had cereal and cooked breakfast, fresh fruit which was often gone and croissants etc. Good bacon and the scrambled eggs were delicious. The staff will bring you fresh pots of tea and coffee on request and there is newspapers in reception to read. The staff on the breakfast area are very good. Had lovely service from a young man and a women on Sunday 20th January, checking in with us if we needed anything, excellent service. 

Food- The Gusto restaurant was closed during our stay which was a shame and the bar area is very small so we choose to eat at Liffey Valley Shopping Centre so cannot comment on food quality.

Parking- It costs 6euro for a full day parking. You can pay at the machine in reception but I went to the reception desk to pay and they gave us a ticket for free parking for when we were leaving the next day which was good.

Rooms- We were put in a family room which was a decent size, tea/coffee facilities, iron, ironing board, hairdryer. Tv had good channels and also childrens channels. The beds were so comfy I slept like a baby. Only downside was the view which was of a car showroom. Room service is available if required although no option for tea/ coffee on this menu which is a shame. (I don’t like to drink out of cups and kettles in hotel rooms) so the option to order would have been nice. Coffe area at reception for takeaway coffee though if required. 

Customer service- The reception staff were nice enough but they could be a little more clear with communication. On Checkin they did not explain anything properly and I was just given a page with details on it. I think there is a park for children some where but this was not explained or pointed out either. 

Swimming pool- Children swim times are Mon-Sun 9am-7pm daily. Adults can go swimming mon-fri 6.30am-9.30pm, sat-sun 8am-7.30pm. There is a children’s pool, jacuzzi, sauna and a larger pool which had lanes split for any swimmers and half of it for family use to play etc. I found the water to look a little murky although warm.  You go to the swimming pool receptions and state you are a hotel guest they give you towels and you need to pay for swimming caps which are 3 euros each. If you have a lock bring it with you for the lockers otherwise they have small free lockers for valuables such as phones/money at reception.",4,2019,01,20
249,"Nice hotel, poor service","Stayed here for one night on a trip to Dublin. Hotel is well located and good value. The service however is terrible. When I stayed restuarant was closed, food available in small bar area only. Service was awful, very difficult to get servers attention, left sitting for 20 mins waiting for drinks which eventually arrived 10 mons after the very average food. Certainly wouldnt eat here again. ",3,2019,01,19
249,Pretty Good Hotel,"I enjoyed my 2 night stay at this hotel. The room was large, clean, and had lots of extras including an iron, safe, kettle etc and hairdryer. Plenty of towels and hot water. Didn't eat at the hotel much but what I did have was fine. In particular, the bed was extremely comfortable and QUIET! I live in a quiet area so can rarely sleep in hotels, but had no trouble here. Only reason I have dropped one star is the location. Its really close (10 mins walk) to shopping area but not great if you are reliant on public transport. Its a good walk to the nearest bus stop and then quite a long bus ride into Dublin City Centre. If you've got your own transport though, it has good parking space.",4,2019,01,16
249,Work party,"Had our work Xmas party here in January,,,lovely hotel,lovely food And especially the staff,,in one particular was Daniel form the bar,,,who help us with lost items,,,total gentlemen and yous are very lucky to have him working there.",4,2019,01,14
249,2 night break 7 adults 5 children ,"Great staff esp Sharon at breakfast and Paula at reception.
We got a great deal excellent breakfast 
Only neg  bedrooms way to warm for this mild January 
Plus if anyone had a baby or child in a cot rather than family room I would definitely recommend executive suite which was €30 per night extra it gives you 2  separate rooms including kitchenette don't think website makes it very clear that it's actually 2 separate rooms so at least at night baby can be in bedroom and ye can relax in kitchen living area 
Excellent children's pool ",4,2019,01,10
249,Family time,Great staff. Friendly accommodating. Room was comfortable with all amenities expected as described. Only criticism is swimming pool. Two options baby pool ankle deep or 1.4 metre only suitable for confident swimmers. My kids are confident in water but youngest couldn’t stand up in main pool and couldn’t swim in the baby pool. Otherwise very satisfied with stay.,4,2019,01,06
249,Basic,"I always stay in Dublin for 3 days Xmas shopping and excursions.
Great for Liffey valley and restaurants. 
About 45 mins in traffic to city center.

Parking charge horrific considering your not city center.
Coffee dock was never open when we looked for a coffee at 11am... 

Staff were very much zombies that grunted...",3,2019,01,06
249,Christmas trip away,"Hotel stay with my partner and children over Christmas stay was pleasant and where pleased with our stay hotel was clean and rooms nice size with 2 double beds and tea and coffee provided.

Car parking however was not free and to use the pool in the club vitae we did have to pay 3 euro each for swim caps.

Hotel is close to liffey valley shopping centre with great choice of restaurants.",3,2019,01,06
249,Amazing breakfast staff,"My partner myself and our 3 years  old baby was staying at the clayton liffey valley for 2 nights we had a very good  experience with the  receptionst  and i  would specially thanks sandrine who make our little one  feel at home in the  breakfast room

I would  recommend this place to anyone who want to have a nice family time. .",5,2019,01,04
249,Great break in this hotel,"I just want to say ‘Thank You’ for taking such good care of us on arrival at the Clayton Liffey Valley, especially Emma Dalton - You were so kind to upgrade us to an amazing room - or 2 bedroom room. The room was fab and it made the break for us. We will definitely be back and we will be booking the same room! 
We loved the pool - plenty space and very family friendly - food was great as were all the staff. 
Great hotel - very reasonable.",5,2019,01,03
249,DISGUSTING treatment to staff,"I was staying at the Clayton hotel last month (December 2018), and while my room was okay, I am absolutely appalled with how poorly you treat your staff. I can't believe that you treat your employees with such disrespect.",1,2019,01,01
249,Super staff and excellent customer service,"Can’t say enough about the staff and customer service at this hotel, especially the assistance given by Paula at reception and Nadine in reservations. After I made a mistake with my booking dates and arrived a day late, they sorted me with a room for my family without any hassle or additional payment. I also have to complement the staff and management who worked tirelessly during an extremely busy breakfast service and did so with a smile and friendly word for all their guests.",5,2018,12,31
249,Overnight stay,"Stsyed here the night of Dec 30th and i can't fsult the place. Great location close to M4 and M50 aswell ss Liffey Valley shopping centre.
From the moment we checked in it was a great experience. The lady on reception( Emma O) was very helpful and friendly and even had a laugh with our kids, she was the best receptionist i have ever dealt with.
The rooms were clean and well sized with plenty of choice on the tv which was great for the kids.
Had room service and food was good. The breakfast the following morning was good with plenty of choice for all. Carpark was free. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and always said hello as they passed you, i know it's only a minor detail but it's still nice and is a sign of a well managed place.
I will 100% be back to stay and i have no problem in saying that.",5,2018,12,31
249,Excellent,We stayed here for a family trip for the second time and it was fab. Perfect. Good in the globe was great. All staff are so friendly. Rooms are super clean and modern with great amenities. Pool great and warm and clean.  The highlight of our trip was Gustos restaurant were Ana from front of house was so welcoming and friendly and the food was so good!! Fantastic meal. We can't wait to come back.,5,2018,12,31
249,Excellent,"Stayed overnight on the to Killarney.
Lovely hotel, super pool and hot tub.
Large room with King size bed. Shame it was just one night. Excellent choice of Breakfast food and very good evening meal. Very good service both restaurant and bar.",5,2018,12,29
249,Family friendly- if you want to drink!,"Stayed here as a family of four, with two children. Room was ok-drawer fronts were hanging off, the reception smelled of sewage, staff were friendly and polite. However I think that child friendly is a bit of a stretch-the hotel was full of families but many were drinking, including at the children’s play area, in lift, coming out of rooms with boxes of drink and kids running everywhere! 
The final shock came when we were charged €6 for parking even though we’d just stayed in the hotel?! I’ve never heard of parking not being complimentary for guests?! Then my brother in law wasn’t charged for his parking so the rule obviously isn’t even consistent. Glad the stay was a gift and I didn’t pay for it myself!",1,2018,12,28
249,Nothing was too much for the staff,"Despite letting the organisers know in advance about my dietary requirements a vegetarian meal wasn’t ordered for me. 
I was attending a conference at this hotel. 
As soon as the staff were informed they got into action and made sure I had a proper and a really delicious vegetarian meal and wasn’t left hungry. 
Full marks to the chef and the restaurant staff. 
Well done.",5,2018,12,21
249,Christmas party,I had the pleasure of booking a Christmas party for 16 people with Stephen coogan.  He made my job so easy from start to finish.  On arrival we where greeted by Dianna who quickly got our party seated with a glass of prosecco. On the note we where so well looked after by Rachel and Keith. Making sure everything was ok. We all where extremely impressed with the fast and friendly service we received.  I would like to thank Stephen Dianna Rachel and Keith for helping to ensure our nite out was a success.  The food was amazing the band csi was brilliant overall a total success.  Will definitely be back,5,2018,12,20

249,Nice place close to shopping center,"i recentley stayed here with my family,the kids loved the room and allwas good, breakfeast was very busy and there was not alot of staff, Sean was quite helpful as i asked for warm milk and i recieved it immediately, Andrew helped us with nice tea and coffee food was good, pool and facilities arevdecent over all stay i am pleased",4,2018,12,17
249,"Thoughtful, kind, staff and lovely clean room","Super room, very comfortable. The staff were so sensitive, thoughtful, helpful and kind as we were staying there to attend a funeral. There was a lovely Irish girl in the restaurant who was so kind to my 90 year old dad. Thank you to Emily who organised taxis and ensured every aspect of our stay was positive.",5,2018,12,17
249,Mr Rodriguez,"I had a lovely stay in this hotel not too long ago, check in was fast and the lad that was helping me at reception was lovely, I think his name was Owen and the room was lovely. I had dinner in the bar and my waiter Adam was very friendly and happy to help with everything. I will definitely be returning.",5,2018,12,16
249,Excellent,"Having stayed here in early December with my girl friends everything from Hayleigh on reception to Mahen in the dining room was top quality. The rooms were is beautiful, clean and comfortable. The food was delicious cant fault anything or anyone. We will be back for another visit!! Thanks very much guys!",5,2018,12,15
249,Elaine,"Have just had a really fantastic stay at Clayton hotel in Liffey Valley.  Receptionist was very helpful, friendly yet so polite.  Bar food absolutely delicious. Room perfect, bed was so comfortable had great night's sleep. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,12,13
249,Poor Experience For a Loyal Customer,"Having stayed at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley over 20 times for business this calendar year tonight will be the last.

It would have been nice for them to either inform me at the time of booking, on the website or even at check in that the restaurant is now CLOSED Sunday to Thursday. YES even their website states the restaurant is open Monday to Saturday 6pm - 9.30pm

With it being Christmas time i invited a couple of customers to join me for dinner only to be left embarrassed when we turned up to a restaurant closed sign.

Sad end to my Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley days!!!!!",1,2018,12,11
249,Shopping,What can I say about Clayton.We arrived Sunday evening minute we walked through the door we felt welcome. Paula and all the staff  were brilliant could not do enough for us lovely quite room on lower level lovely  clean room and big .breakfast was fab and staff to .Definitely stay again. Thanks Paula,5,2018,12,11
249,UporDown ,"Stayed here for one night and it all went wrong from moment. Set foot inside door receptionist was abrupt and not professional in my opinion and manager called was not much better basically felt I was been treated like some one that was about to steal from place 
Matters got worse when restaurant was closed and got bar food curry was like cold sour milk then met friend in bar for drink I was driving so not drinking very limited range of English by person serving not interested in serving non alcoholic beers and limited to one did not have any experience and said this is bar so alcohol drinks main idea also had only limited soft drinks again more excuses 
The breakfast was the same again cold with scrambled egg like rubber and I’ve given better looking fried eggs to the dogs really this needs management and sooner than later for to be honest when it’s like this in the public view I’d fear what it is like in out of bounds  areas 
and on check out the other receptionist did not even have the cop on to ask if everything was ok a suspect she knew it was not  so my opinion if visiting Dublin stay well clear  of this dive that’s my experience and spend your money where it will be appreciated and you get good service neither of which are high on this hotels list 
So my opinion steer well clear 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿",1,2018,12,07
249,A wonderful family stay,I recently had the pleasure of staying in The Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley and had a wonderful experience. From the moment we walked in the door we got a lovely greeting at reception and felt at home. The hotel and the rooms are very tastefully decorated and cosy. The rooms and facilities in the rooms are of a very high spec. Nothing we asked for was a problem. We had breakfast on both mornings in the hotel and the selection of food was excellent. There were two very helpful waitresses Sandrine and Binta who couldn’t have been more pleasant. Anything we requested they were more than happy to sort for us. A real case of service with a smile. The Clayton Liffey Valley is definitely going to be our No: 1 go to hotel in the future when visiting Dublin.,5,2018,12,06
249,Christmas party,stayed here and attended Christmas party on 1st December 2018 great night and great service from all staff i would say the only thing i would fault would be the size of the bar was pretty small so had to wait long times to be served drinks but other then that great time,4,2018,12,04
249,Average at best !!,"I hadn’t stayed here in a while and it will be a long time before I stay here again. It was as I said average at best. 
Check in was slow, at 6 pm, one person checking in and a queue of five people waiting. A second person was added before I left. 
Rooms are ok, nothing special. Not the cleanest I have ever stayed in. 
The most disappointing part was the food. I stayed on a Tuesday night and there was only bar food available. I took a seat and waited 10 minutes to be told if you want food you need to sit in the back side of the bar. I moved to another table and waited another 15 minutes, but nobody came to take drinks order or give me a menu. In the end I had to go to and get a menu from the bar.
Food was ok....service was poor, the only thing that was high was the price.

Better hotels within the same price range not to far away.

249,Disappoonting,"It is easy to understand that the cutlery and delph in this restaurant are anything but clean. Cups, jugs, teapots, coffee pots etc could badly do with a proper cleansing or replacement. Not impressed.",3,2018,12,03
249,Basic and ,Nothing very inviting about this hotel. Reception area not welcoming.  Big metal stairway right in the middle of it. Total lack of atmosphere especially at this time of year. Lack of seating in small bar area and then ran out of ice for drinks later in evening. Kids running and playing until 11pm with absolutely no supervision. Not what you want when trying to have a relaxing night out. Restaurant and bar struggled to cope with numbers. Menu so badly photocopied you couldn’t make out what was on the limited menu. No specials available. Breakfast had watered down orange juice and messy tables not cleared. Floors dirty. Not a hotel for rest or relaxation. It’s overpriced and 2 stars would be enough for this hotel. Plus you are also charged €6 to park your car. Staff nice and pleasant at all times. ,3,2018,12,02
249,Amazing!!!,"We loved the Clayton Hotel in Liffey Valley, the accommodation was fabulous and extremely comfortable.The food in Gusto was excellent and a chap called Kevin  made my kids with Autism so relaxed 👌🌟🌟🌟",5,2018,12,02
249,Business Meetings,Frequently use the hotel bar for business meetings and find the food (Chicken Curry in particular) and the service to be excellent - always well looked after by Sharon & Sharon. Will keep coming back.,5,2018,11,26
249,Conference service,"On Saturday 24th November, I was on a business trip to address an audience of about 160 people at a conference  at the Clayton Hotel. My presentation involved switching from powerpoint to a video clip and then switching back again.  I had experienced problems doing this in other venues.  On this occasion, Jack, who was the person designated to assist with arrangements, ensured that the technology worked perfectly and was most obliging.  I was both impressed and appreciative!",5,2018,11,25
249,Enjoyable stay,Had a great 2 night stay in this hotel.  Check in was seamless.  Room was bright spacious and bathroom was big. Breakfast was varied with lots of healthy options available. Had dinner in Gustos Restaurant both nights and staff were friendly and professional.  Food was lovely. Would like to thank Kevin in the restaurant especially who looked after us both nights and was very witty. A very enjoyable stay,5,2018,11,24
249,Couldn’t fault it,Lovely clean hotel. Staff very friendly. USB Charging doc in lobby was very useful. Great choice and variety at breakfast. Big comfortable bed. Very accessible from motorway and on Liffey Valley’s shopping center doorstep. Great gym and was very busy with locals too. This hotel was great value for my mid week stay. I will defiantly be back.,5,2018,11,21
249,"Fabulous Hotel, not enough staff","My husband and I and 2 kids (8 and 6) arrived at the hotel at 3.15pm as we knew checkin was from 3. There was a queue and when we finally got to the counter we were advised that there was a problem with our room and that it would be ready within 10 minutes. Paula then asked if we drank beer and gave us a drinks voucher for 2 complimentary drinks and asked us to wait in the bar. We decided to keep it for later as we were going out to the Wild Lights and waited in the lobby. After half an hour I approached the desk and queued again as the kids were bored and asked for an update. She didn't have one and I asked if my family could go ahead to the pool and I would wait for the room. She gave me our room number and said this was no problem so they went ahead down. I sat in the lobby until 4.30pm and had to approach Paula again. She told me that she had moved us to another room as the one we had been assigned still wasn't ready and this was the same as the one we were supposed to be in and she gave me 2 free parking tickets by way of apology for the waiting. It was a long walk to the room and when I arrived one of the cards wasn't working so I had to return to reception. The room was lovely but very warm and we couldn't find any controls to regulate it. The bar was lovely and the hotel itself very nice. The kids really enjoyed the pool and the steam room and sauna were great. the next morning at breakfast was chaos. There was a queue for breakfast and the staff were just chucking delph and cutlery from one table to another to clear them. There were 3 large tables next to ours just piled high with dirty dishes waiting to be taken away and the ladies waiting on tables just kept adding to them. It made me feel uncomfortable to see such a mess everywhere. The food was fantastic, great choice and all very tasty and fresh but it was almost impossible to get a pot of tea. Parking was very secure and lots of spaces. The hotel is in a fantastic location and any of the staff we spoke to were pleasant and helpful but I feel that it is extremely short staffed and management needs to up their game.",3,2018,11,21
249,Dirty Room,"I’m so sorry  I didn’t take pictures ! 
Bathroom was dirty and the shower was full of hair so it needed a good hose down .. By the curtain we discovered men’s dirty swimwear / shorts .. 
We were fortunately given one of those adjoining rooms so next door spent the night on phones and having a mini party as well comming and going banging the doors .. 
We rang down to reception 3 times between 1am and 3 am  to complain about the noise and asked to have something done .. nobody came and we were just ignored ! 
To be fair the staff were all very nice as was the manager who dealt with all our complaints the next day but  considering we book 2 rooms ,dined in their restaurant( 4 of us so we had a hefty bill) he has offered us a ‘ better ‘ rate the next time we stay ! 
Safe to say you ll never get a another penny of us again . Disgraceful experience!",1,2018,11,19
249,Terrible/Poor Service,"The only reason this hotel scores a 2 is because of the close proximity to the centre of town and the airport and the rooms are nice, however, what was really a let down was the service we received when we first checked in. 
I will admit I did make a mistake when booking the room, I booked a triple room, however, I only booked the room for 2 people. So I asked them to fix the change as my younger brother was with me as well, I didn't think it would be that big a deal as it happened in Florence as well with an addition 10 euros, which was fine. However, on this occasion the hotel decided to double the price from 92 euros to 184 euros! I understand they were busy and the hotel was full, however, we weren't asking for an extra room. Clayton Hotel was just taking advantage of the fact that my younger brother had no where else to go. 
So I go upstairs to the room to find that were were given a double bed with a fold out sofa!!we paid double the price for a fold out sofa?! So we went downstairs to get it changed and to their credit, we had it changed to a room with two double beds.
We were also told upon check in that we had breakfast included. So before we went out for the night, I went to confirm that we would be having the breakfast in the morning, only to be told we would have to pay and extra 12euro per person! I asked the guest relations manager why were we told differently and she couldn't explain only that she would speak to the staff member involved. When I saw the staff member I went to ask him why he said we had a breakfast and he said it was his mistake and we didn't get breakfast. No apology! And the Guest Relations Manager didn't seem to care that we were misguided. What had happened if we didn't confirm and had the breakfast?we would have been charged for something we were told was included in the price. Unacceptable service allround!  ",2,2018,11,18
249,Nice staff doing their best but not enough of them,"Firstly to provide positive feedback on the staff who seem to working within a system that forces them to offer a less than ideal service. We arrived to check in at 4.30pm, not too late, yet as we parked the hotel called us to see if we were still coming! At the desk we were told that despite us booking a double room 3 weeks previously there was no double rooms available. They could however upgrade us to an executive suite...however this was not yet ready. With a dinner reservation made for elsewhere we were tight for time. I queried how our room could have been reallocated so early and I was given the number for the reservations team. One of the team came up to meet us; however, there was little she could do except offer us free parking and a drinks voucher. This gesture was appreciated but did not get us closer to our room, it was now 5pm. Shortly after we were given a room with 2 double beds, which was fine. We arrived down for breakfast this morning at 10am to be greeted with a queue from the restaurant to the front door. There are signs to warn of busy periods but what was most frustrating was to see, when we finally got into the restaurant, that there many free tables just waiting to be cleared. One would have to surmise that there are not enough housekeeping staff or waiting staff rostered to meet the demands of the bookings taken! This results in at best an average experience of staying in what was in the past a really good value hotel. I overheard a few people in the breakfast queue remarking that they won't be back and we would certainly have to explore other options before returning.",3,2018,11,18
249,Great weekend break,"Spent two nights here over the weekend. The room had great facilities, the only negative was the fact I could hear the people in the room next door until early morning because the rooms aren’t soundproofed. 
The breakfast is very nice, would recommend arriving early as after 8:30-9am the queue of people starts. 
The bus into Dublin City costs €2.85 per adult each way, and the bus only takes coins in exact change so be prepared. There is a shopping centre a 10 minute walk away with restaurants and shops which was good to have. 
If you drive, the car park is €6 per day. 
There is an airport shuttle bus costing €10 each which was convenient. ",4,2018,11,17
249,Business booking for regular meetings & training sessions,"We have always found the Clayton Liffey Valley to be very professional with highest of  standards for holding meeting and training sessions for our clients . There food is also excellent , overall great service and value for money",5,2018,11,16
249,Great service😀,"Was there with a friend during the week, absolutely great service by the 2 Sharons who were great company and a great laugh, we were going through a bad day and they completely turned it around, such nice people, Thank you Clayton Hotel and also a very big Thank you too the 2 sharons!!!",5,2018,11,14
249,Lovely Hotel But ...,"We stayed in the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley for 2 nights, 5th and 6th of November and all went well our breakfast was lovely but on the Sunday evening we had to have our dinner in the bar as the restaurant does not open Sunday nights. We sat for near a half hour and nobody came near us so eventually I went up to the bar to ask if I had to order at the bar and the bar man was rude and said that I did not turn the light. I had no idea what he was talking about and he said again “ turn the light” I returned to my chair and turned the light which turned red, now I must say that it was written on top of the light but how many people examine the light on a table as often they are candles. I think it should be written on the menu or on a card on the table, I had to say it to an elderly couple who were sitting there before we came in.",5,2018,11,13
249,Good quality hotel quite near Dublin,"Two nights on business stayed at the Clayton hotel Liffey village, quite handy for a shopping centre. Got on an airport hopper bus €8 straight to reception! Saved a small fortune in taxi fees for my company. Great rooms large and well appointed. Nice bar area and quality Italian  restaurant. Breakfast very good although a little busy.

All in all great hotel close to Dublin City centre.",4,2018,11,13
249,Very pleasant stay in the Clayton,"Rooms very comfortable, beds comfy and linen nice and crisp. 
spotless room. staff very pleasant and accommodating. Will def be back. We are planning a stay maybe coming up to Christmas to do a bit of shopping in the local shopping centre.",5,2018,11,12
249,Great Spot,"Friendly check in staff. Rooms spacious and very reasonably priced. Excellent location for any trips to the Capital. Secure carpark facilities. Hotel has fabulous pool and leisure facilities. Ideal for Families, couples, friend's, the lot !!! ",5,2018,11,11
249,"Great hotel, lovely staff.",Food in both the bar and restaurant was great as was breakfast each morning. The staff we met were lovely and accommodating. We arrived late and needed milk for our daughter and they provided it. Parking is €6 a day just to let people know. ,4,2018,11,10
249,Irish friendliness at its best,"Having spent the week at the Clayton Liffey Valley to attend a training course I cannot find fault with the staff, facilities or quality of service - but a special mention is warranted for Sharon (breakfast and lunch waitress) who brought sunshine (to match her blonde hair) into the restaurant whenever she went about her day.

As I was travelling on my own Sharon's infectious charm and easy going friendliness brightened up my stay so much and reflected so well on the hotel and on my first impressions of Ireland.

I would not hesitate to return to this hotel in the future if I am back in the area.",5,2018,11,09
249,Well located,"This is a well-located hotel that appears to be primarily for business people but has leisure facilities that were in use by families during our visit. We too were staying for a business meeting and our meeting room was light and, although small, didn’t feel cramped. There is a coffee station in the lobby which serves good coffee and is a nice touch, and the lunches were decent with extremely generous portion sizes. My bedroom had three beds but was spacious and comfortable enough. There was a varied buffet breakfast but yet another of those rotating toasters that you have to put the bread through two or three times - why, oh why do hotels have these toasters? The staff were very nice.",4,2018,11,07
249,Breakfast serving a little dissapointing,Recently stayed at the hotel and bedroom was lovely but very warm..Mobile air conditioning unit wascavailable but not adequate enough.. Beds were very comfortable..There was a queue for breakfast in the morning and we were sent to the restaurant.. No side plates or napkins by bread or nothing to handle the hot breakfast plates.. .. we had to request butter and milk..pastries.. We had to wait for a fresh batch of all hot food.. Also noted tables were not being cleaned off...Staff were doing the best they could in following up with guest requests..,3,2018,11,06
249,Pleasant overnight stay,"Stayed here for one night as I had an appointment next day.  Room was lovely and comfy with great blinds which keep out the light which I like.   Staff were lovely and friendly and helpful.   I ate in one of the restaurants that night and it was nice ,   breakfast was fabulous.    My only negatives were that I felt check in was a bit slow - I was very tired and in a hurry to get to my room.",4,2018,11,06
249,"Mark,Cork","Returning fanily of 4. Modern hotel, convenient location to Airport & Dublin City Center via Car. Liffey Valley shopping center within walking distance. Food quality good in bar/restaurant & great breakfast. Staff friendly and rooms clean & comfortable. Good pool & gym facilities and would definitely return.",4,2018,11,05
249,Disappointing,"Just returned from a three night stay, not really value for money.  Rooms in need of of a make over, for example plug in bath broken and temporary rubber plug not a good fit so had problems filling bath, curtains didn't fit window as hanging off rail! Had problems in restaurant with food ordered not arriving at the same time! For the price did not meet expectations and would prefer a Premier Inn/Travel Lodge. Make sure when booking your room is not able to be ajoining as we experienced an annoying level of noise from the young family next door. We did have a nice stay just disappointing for the price!",3,2018,11,03
249,Lovely hotel very convenient to all amenities ,"I found this hotel to be easily accessible from the motorway and it is very convenient to all amenities. The room was very well laid out including a lovely kitchen with a sofa and a small table, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom immaculate. 
I was checked in by a nice, helpful young man. However, this was in stark contrast to his non national colleague, I was going to my room when a non English speaking tour group arrived. They had great difficulty finding their rooms and I let the receptionist know as the rooms were not well signposted, I explained that I am local and I also had difficulty finding my room. She dismissed me and claimed that there was a tour guide along with them - this was clearly not the case as I spent 10 minutes with them and there was total confusion and they were asking me!! I felt that her attitude was most unhelpful and very negative, it also left me feeling that they did not go out of their way to care about their customers. ",3,2018,11,02
249,Very basic,"A family of 5 with no availability of inter-connecting rooms. Check-in took longer than is usually required after a 2 hour drive from Galway. Kevin at reception was obviously just training-in as he provided no information about the hotel, pool, breakfast or other facilities!! He didnt even utter that important phrase ""enjoy your stay!!!  Very disappointing as other reviews specifically commented on the courtesy of the staff. 
 Room really cold and no extra blankets provided. Such a pity as I really wanted to enjoy my stay and give a positive review. However apart from small portion size in bar , food was tasty and the location of the hotel is great.",3,2018,11,02
249,Great hotel in convenient location,"This is a really great hotel in a location that's not too far from the city centre or the airport-if you have a car. The staff are very friendly and mostly efficient. I did have an issue with my room and the desk staff immediately dealt with the issue and put me in contact with the duty manager.
Breakfast was good, with a great selection and plenty available but there was no tea or coffee available until 15 minutes after the start of breakfast so that was a little disappointing.
The hotel has a good spa facility with a jacuzzi,sauna and steam room.
The hotel is located next to a really great mall with a wide selection of restaurants and a cinema. ",4,2018,11,02
249,Wonderful Half Term Stay,"Just home from our first (hopefully of many!) stay at the Clayton. Its a wonderful family friendly hotel and we can't wait to return. It's in a great location just off the motorway and very close to a huge shopping centre (Liffey Valley) as well as express buses into the city centre. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food, both at breakfast and dinner was 1st class with something for everyone. We had one meal included but went back for a second night as the pizza was magnificent! The pool was great and large enough to handle plenty of people and not feel crowded. It's a big hotel but it's also got the personal touch thanks to the friendliness and attention to detail of the staff.",5,2018,11,02
249,Great location and friendly staff,"Clayton HOTEL Liffey Valley is great hotel, prefect location, 15 mins to airport and 20 mins to city center by taxi, 40 mins by public transit( great way to see the city on the cheap). The hotel is also just 5 min walk to a huge mall. We enjoyed our stay very much. Khalid on front desk even had takeaway bags with breakfast treats for the three couples in our group, for our early morning flight. Dining room staff especially Little Kev (O’Leary)were super friendly ,food was great too.  I would highly recommend this hotel if youre looking for a place to stay in Dublin. You won’t be disappointed..",5,2018,10,31
249,Good facility,"Located just outside Dublin, easy to get into the city down the N4 or head over to the West Coast.  Nice room, friendly service, plus gym and swimming pool you could use.  Parking available onsite for a low cost, food available, standard unknown as ate out.",4,2018,10,31
249,Frustrating stay! Not suitable for families of 4+,"We’d travelled all day and were looking forward to getting checked in with three small tired children. On arrival at 6pm our interconnecting room was not ready. We were asked by a lovely young man at the check in to wait in the bar until it was ready. We had been promised by email that we would get an interconnecting room as all of our family could not be accommodated in one room. After half an hour or so the room was ready. I took the key card, went to allocates room and walked in on a roomful of guests!!! Back to reception! We then got the correct key and wandered back down the long corridor again (dragging three children in tow!) 

 We waited for 2.5hrs for the connecting door to be unlocked. Then a lady arrived up and returned twice more to unsuccessfully open the locked door. At 9:30 after her third trip she promised a solution would be found. That was the last communication we had from the hotel. I spent a dreadful night/morning trying to sort three children across two rooms. €191 room only!! is a lot of money for this level of poor service.

I found Amanda on reception to be less than helpful. I was not asked if I was happy with my stay.

A beautiful clean hotel, some lovely staff but sadly due to our very frustrating experience we will not be returning. I would urge you to be very careful if you have more than 2 children and plan to stay here.",2,2018,10,30
249,"Lovely staff but busy, noisy hotel ","We stayed here for 4 nights during the October half-term holiday.  We chose the hotel because it was near the centre and the airport but cheaper then staying in the city.  It’s fine for what it is and the only reason I am posting a review is that there are just a few things I wish I’d known before I stayed.  The hotel is beside the N4 dual carriageway and there is traffic noise day and night (we saw 2 accidents from our window during our stay).  Other reviewers didn’t seem to have a problem with this but we found the sound proofing of the rooms to be non-existent. We were in an executive suite which is great for families (kitchenette, separate rooms to sleep in etc) but it is the closest room to the road and to the lift which was going up and down all night.  On one night during our stay there was a party going on in one of the rooms until 5:30am.  We complained and the staff tried their best but the party started up again once security left.  The hotel offered to move rooms the next day but we didn’t take them up in their offer as it was our last night and the guests causing the commotion had checked out.  None of this is necessarily something that is easily changed by the hotel and it’s not a complaint.  It’s just worth knowing that this is a big, busy hotel which is not going to make for a relaxing stay.  We had to queue for breakfast and the swimming pool was crowded at all times.  The rooms and leisure centre could do with  a bit of attention and maintenance. The staff are all really nice and do their best to help but we wouldn’t return.  The whole experience felt a bit exhausting.  It may just have been the timing of our visit. ",3,2018,10,29
249,The staff made the trip.,"We stayed for one week in the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley. The rooms I cannot complain, clean and spacious. The over all cleanliness off the hotel was top notch. The restaurant Gustó was fantastic, the food was enjoyed by all and the service was quick and friendly. The one thing that genuinely affected our stay in the hotel would be the over all heating. We found the hotel to be very cold from about 8pm onward. During the day the air curtain would be on over the double doors making the lobby area cosy but after dark the curtain was switched off and the hotel became very cold. In the bar the draught was icy which made the us and many others not want to be seated in the area. I asked numerous times for the doors to be closed over or for the air-conditioning to be switched off to which I was told it was not possible. Also, to be charging residents €6 a day for parking is shocking when visitors do not have to pay a penny. You'd think it would be the other way around? The saving grace of the hotel would have to be the staff. We all took a shining to Natalie the night resident bar manager. She was a delight to be around and provided excellent service any time of day. Her help and friendly personality made us feel right at home. I also have to mention Emmanuel, his service and fantastic bubbly personality without a doubt always put a smile on our face. I'd like to thank all of the staff for having us in the hotel.

Kind regards. 
Alexandra.",3,2018,10,28
249,First class comfortable hotel,We enjoyed our stay at the Clayton Hotel.   Our room was big and very comfortable and the breakfast and evening meals we had there were excellent.   The hotel is easy to get to from the airport and there are good road links for onward travel.   We would be very happy to stay there again.,5,2018,10,23

249,Important to congratulate excellent service,"Important to congratulate excellent service, 
I have used this hotel on a number of occasions, and I must congratulate the two Sharon's who work in the restaurant. Both are a credit to the hotel. I have observed them on a number of occasions going over and above to look after us. It is for this reason that we have and will return time and time again.",5,2018,10,23
249,It could have been...,"I will start with the good things about the hotel; easy to find, next to motorway and M50 to get around, breakfast is very nice and plenty, its very clean inside both rooms corrifors and main areas except windows! Maybe its almost impossible in Ireland as it rains a lot. Now, we took an offer and I who travelled alone got a room in the basement!! Yes in the basement right out to a stairway with people passing from underground parking window imposinle to open though excepto for 5cm to get air in but it still created a lot of insecurity being on my own. Using the shower the water was absolutely everywhere as the curtains ( who uses curtains today and in a 4* hotel??)were too short but even so the so-called showerhead were broken or something because the water judt splashed out. Making it dangerous to step out as you would have 3-4cm water all over. Had to use towells to dry it all up. Hairdryer was not working. Bed was good though and the room was spaceful, clean and furnitures all right. There are also facilities for tea and coffee +a small fridge. But the idea of paying 229 for 2 nights in a basement next to the storerooms killed was cery dissappointing. Ok we were not there to stay in the room but still you would like something nice to return to after a long day out. You have to have a car here!!! Parking 6 euros pr night I find reasonable though other hotels nearby offers free parking.  There are other hotels same price in the outskirts of Dublin to same or better price. It could have been nice  but...no. Will only recommend based on breakfast good and near everything if you find a very good offer pointing out high up.unless of course offer rooms are here but if so it should say. My friends were ground floor right out to parking. From the motorway you dont hear any noise at all. ",3,2018,10,22
249,Overnight stay before onward travel to family wedding,Hi had a great stay on Wednesday 17 october. Booked a suite traveling with mum and my partner great value very spacious and well appointed was allocated family of day which was a pleasant surprise dined in main restaurant meal was delicious and welcome after days travelling.

They really  topok care of the sonas gtoup.on Friday  the 19th of december I  would highly recommend  them ,5,2018,10,19
249,Too far from Dublin City,"Clean, comfortable hotel, but too far from the City Centre of Dublin. It cost between £25/£30 by taxi to get into the city. Be careful if going by bus, some don't take cash, you need a pre paid card, others will only take the exact money.",3,2018,10,19
249,Staff,"I have stayed in many hotels and have to say that the staff are very friendly. Rooms spotless And the pizza is to be had...restaurant staff make you feel welcome and look after you, to make you feel relaxed to enjoy your meal. I will return.",5,2018,10,18
249,Great hotel - ticks all boxes,"I've stayed here a few times now & it's just great!  The staff are really good, location perfect, plenty of parking & our kids loved the playroom and swimming pool.  Rooms really spacious and clean.  Reasonably priced.  The food is great in the restaurant and good choice at breakfast buffet.  We will definitely be back!",5,2018,10,18
249,Nice clean place. ,"Reception and the manager were really good and accommodating. My friend slipped off the shower and they came right away and looked after my friend and offered to call doctor. They checked on my friends for the next consecutive days 
One day we arrived, we found fruits , chocolates and water in our room that we never expected. You feel safe straying  at the lobby or walking to the mall and walking back to the hotel even when it’s dark
Today we went for breakfast and asked for milk when they served the coffee which they normally serve, the lady server said the container of milk which is 1/3 full was there to wait for any customer.  I replied, that milk was the left over from the previous customers  because even the host said someone was seating and had used that table. I just tried to explain to the server but she said”it’s ok I will take it off if u don’t want this milk” I explained again you cannot let us consume somebody else’s left over, its also infection control. She said “well you can go see the manager if you want” 
I’m just saying this so it won’t happen again and before answering,, one must listen first and be careful in responding. 

Our stay here is still very good and the rest of the staff are really respectful and pleasant specially the receptionists and the coffee bar at the lobby. 

More power. Will stay here again and will recommend  this hotel to our family and friends ",4,2018,10,18
249,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here with my family for 4 days at October holiday. Lovely hotel very friendly and helpful staff, nothing was a bother. Great selection at breakfast too. My teenage son was very impressed with the hotel gym too and the range if equipment. Would definitely go again!
",5,2018,10,17
249,2nd Stay and already looking forward to our 3rd!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in Oct 18 for my son's birthday - we had stayed before and will stay again. Before arrival, I advised the booking staff about my son's birthday and he was greeted with some chocs and a card in his room. It really made a great first impression for him. On check in, there was a queue, due to an arrival of a bus tour - understandably. One of the managers on duty came over to every one in the queue, welcomed us and advised that another staff member was en route to help us. I recommend this hotel 100% and the pizza meal deal for the room (2 pizzas, a truck load of wedges, wings, garlic bread and 4 soft drinks for €35!). The leisure and bar/waiting staff were also very helpful/polite despite the hotel being very busy. This is how a hotel should run. Thanks to all @ Clayton for another memorable stay.",5,2018,10,16
249,Brilliant staff in Kudos,"I always eat in Kudos for lunch as I work very close and the 2 Sharon's are always very welcoming and chatty :) Keep up the good work. I would recommend the hotel for food, business or overnight stay. I have also used the hotel for meetings and the rooms are very spacious and the staff always have everything ready to go when required.",5,2018,10,15
249,Brilliant service,Was there last Friday for lunch and the service we received was next to none. A special shout out to the two Sharon's that assisted us. They were both very welcoming and pleasant. Will definitely be back.,5,2018,10,15
249,Family trip,"Just back from a fab overnight package at Clayton Hotel. Warmly welcomed at reception with staff taking time to get my kids a welcome gift of colouring in books. A box of chocolates were awaiting my husband with a hand written birthday card from staff in the room. The room was really spacious with 2 single beds and 1 double lots of room for family of four and good that the kids didn't need to share. 
Our package included 3 course dinner at Gusto restaurant which was excellent steak was a 7 euro suppliment but well worth it. Kids were well catered for too with good choices and pizza boxes provided as they couldn't finish their meals. All in all great hotel we will definitely be back. ",5,2018,10,14
249,Convenient for early flight,"Staff were very nice and friendly.  Hotel is clean and updated . Less than 15 to the airport which was great for our purposes.   The hotel gym / pool offers membership to local residents so considering the size of the amenities, the gym and pool area is crowed .  The whirlpool was full the entire time I was in there - about an hour. 
We were offered an ""upgrade"" to a suite .  It is a separate building a hundred feet away from the hotel.  This building and surrounding area was not well lite . There is no staff in this building . Your room key allows you access to the building.  There was a guy hanging around the door .  He waited for me to open the door and walked in with me.  Security might be an issue.  I was uncomfortable with the fact there wasn't staff on site.   When we went out to use the gym facilities, we asked someone we met on the elevator about parking.  The gentleman explained that he has been living in this building for 5 months as part of a program with the government to aid homeless people.  He is waiting for subsidized housing and until the government can find him something they have placed him in there.  He was very nice and we never felt unsafe but let's  say if I were to stay here again , I would politely decline the ""upgrade"".",3,2018,10,12
249,Top quality service,"Visited the Clayton for a conference and was greeted with great grub and service all around! Payal at the desk was so professional and courteous and was able to assist handily. The restaurant was fantastic too, as the burger was beautiful and the desert, delightful. I also wanted to thank Sharon (both of them) in particular for the consistent service and for being so great at anticipating what my group and I needed. If you’re going to the restaurant look out for Ivo as well, he has some great tips and suggestions in him.  ",5,2018,10,11
249,Great conference venue,"I recently organised a conference with Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley and was super impressed. All the staff were really helpful and all of our delegates were well looked after throughout, in particular Jamie and Daniel. The service and food were great. ",5,2018,10,10
249,Business stay,"I’ve stayed here many times in recent times and enjoyed every stay. The hotel is great and is in a great location. The staff are also great especially Ivo, Sharon, Oisin and Andrew at breakfast. The food is really good also. I used the gym quite often also and it was a great gym. Overall the hotel has very few flaws and I would recommend to both business and family stays.",5,2018,10,08
249,WOW WOW WOW!!!,"Amazing experience from start to finish. We were greeted at reception by Amanda who was just fantastic. So friendly and welcoming. We were upgraded to a lovely suite which was a lovely surprise. Had dinner is the restaurant and breakfast the following morning. We met kristina from the reception the next day a to say she was amazing is just and understatement, what an asset you have in this lady, so helpful.
Will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,08
249,Attended a business seminar,"This hotel really looks after their business seminar clients. Excellent facilities & location, delicious food for lunch too. The restaurant management ensures that large numbers of delegates are served very efficiently. Highly recommend ",5,2018,10,07
249,Amazing stay,Myself and my husband stayed here with our two children just before they went back to school. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we thought the activities for kids were great especially with the shopping centre being less that a five minute walk away and good value deal in the cinema. We ate in the restaurant two out of three night and had breakfast each morning. Food at dinner was good but breakfast was great with friendly staff especially Andrew. We will definitely be back!!,5,2018,10,05
249,Should be a 5 star,"This hotel is great. Ivo the restaurant manager gave me one of 3 teddy bears remaining when I asked and for free!!! Thanks Ivo. Its My new favourite hotel in Dublin. The staff are great. Its modern, great food etc but the staff give it the edge of quality that make it a place worth visiting and a place worth returning to.. Its the little things. 100% thumbs up. Thank you for your hospitality.",5,2018,10,05
249,Clean with comfy beds,"Great hotel for a third of the price of staying in the city centre. Convenient location with its own restaurants plus across the road from a mall with a big choice of other restaurants. An easy 20 minute bus or taxi ride into the city.  Approx €2.85 per adult on the bus and approximately €18 in a taxi. Hotel was clean and the beds in the rooms comfortable. We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 kids and the kids’ were normal single beds-not sofa beds, camp beds or similar. Only complaint was we were not offered a package to include breakfast whereas our friends were-instead, if we wanted it, it was €40 for 2 adults & 2 children to have breakfast each day! We had the breakfast on one day and there was a lot of choice including gluten free options. ",5,2018,10,01
249,1 night stay,"Just after a one night stay in the Clayton Hotel at Liffey Valley.  My sister and I attended the Shania Twain concert at the 3 Arena and stayed here.  The hotel was great.  Reception staff were nice and easy to check in.  We had food in the bar before the concert.  I had the prawns which were amazing!  The room was clean, comfortable and had a small balcony which over looked the hotel entrance.  Car park was €6 for overnight.  We went to the shopping centre the following day.  The hotel is very convenient for a shopping trip or if in Dublin.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2018,09,29
249,Best breakfast ever,Just returned from a lovely stay. Myself my husband and baby girl stayed for a two night break. Our stay however was cut short due to a family issue but your reservations and reception team were brilliant and refunded our second night with no issues. We did get to stay one night. Rooms are nice and clean and nice and quiet considering how close it is to the busy motorway. Breakfast is amazing. Best breakfast I've ever had and we were seated very quickly considering how busy the hotel was. Great staff and a great location. The manager Paul was amazing and a credit to your hotel. ,5,2018,09,27
249,Perfect location for bussines and plesure,"I always stay here for business. They have a nice spacious suites and apartments with living area and kitchen, perfect for long stay. Very easy acces to Dublin centre, shopping and to the airport. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 

When I had to wait for my room to check in (it was not ready yet) I was offered a complimentary dinner in Gusto restaurant. 

I enjoy fresh Guinness in the Globe Bar served by Andrzej always attentive and proffesional as well as the rest of the bar staff.

Thanks for great evenings.",5,2018,09,25
249,"Wonderful Hotel, Excellent Staff","My stay here was for business.  The location was perfect for me going to the shopping center (Mall) and to work (Intel).  I especially looked forward to the breakfast, were I was always greeted professionally by Ana (the petite young lady) and Sharon (the one who made me hot lemon tea because I was sick) with a warm good morning, friendly smiles and a nice pot of hot coffee or tea.  Both ladies are truly a credit to the success of the hotel in my opinion.  Thank you both for making my business trip feel complete.  I'm truly looking forward to staying at this hotel on my next business trip or my next vacation.",5,2018,09,20
249,"Fantastic hotel, amazing staff, quality grub","i tend to spend quite a bit of time at this hotel for work throughout the week, and i cant compliment the quality from start to finish enough. Leo and the girl at the front bistro are such lovely people and make my morning coffee that bit more special with their heartwarming smile and attention to detail. Leo's mochas are awesome - i actually look forward to it everyday. and as for the team in the Globe restaurant....they are 2nd to none. Their attention to detail with every customer makes them feel like the only customer here. And for all of the staff to be this way is remarkable - testament to the culture of the team (and especially the 2 Sharon's whom I've come to know a little). Their positivity and smiles are infectious. 

It really is rare these days to find a team in the hospitality industry so dedicated to their work and their customers.

thank you for being AWESOME!!",5,2018,09,18
249,"Stay from 6th to 9th September, 2018","Very pleased with the room, the service and the restaurant! Proximity to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre a real plus. Swimming pool a delight! Beds very comfortable and the staff very pleasant and helpful!",5,2018,09,15

249,Fantastic family break,"Booked a family break with dinner, breakfast and tickets to Dublin zoo for my daughter's 12th birthday and so glad I did. This hotel is beautiful and very family orientated. Check in was straightforward and the lady at reception was really nice. I had pre-booked my daughter a surprise birthday cake and when we got up to the room it was on the table for her she was so excited the look on her face was priceless. Was so nice of the staff to arrange this for her and can't thank them enough. We booked an executive suite and it was huge just perfect for us as we had 2 children and a baby with us. We booked dinner at the gusto restaurant and it was lovely. I have to mention Ben, he was a waiter here and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. He really does know how to treat guests properly. Food is delicious and you will not leave this restaurant hungry we were all stuffed. My daughter had a second surprise when she had happy birthday wrote on her dessert such a nice thing to do and Ben had asked quietly was it her birthday so I believe he was involved in this kind gesture. We all got up for breakfast early and staff were pleasant to us again. I can see why the hotel has 4 stars it is a great hotel and my family will carry the memory of staying here for a long time. Great base for visiting the zoo or Dublin. Thanks so much to the staff will not hesitate to come back in the future.",5,2018,09,12
249,Mr Jonathan Harris,"A lovely hotel with brilliant bar staff they always make you feel and home and welcome especially Big Little Kev and Natalie who are brilliant.

249,Amazing holiday,"I stayed here recently with the family and we had such an amazing time. The staff went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed everything. Payal welcomed us to the hotel and she was such a lovely girl. The room was great, very cosy except for the fact that it was loud at times as we were beside the motorway. Andrew couldn’t do any more for us to make our breakfast the best. He was so kind and he even hit my son a birthday present. What a wonderful young lad he was. The food was great at both breakfast and dinner where the portions were brilliant. We went to the pool a couple of times and Martin was great craic and making the kids laugh. It was great to have such a wonderful stay in this hotel and we will most definitely be back again soon. Thank you Clayton hotel Liffey Valley!",5,2018,09,12

249,Liffey Valley Clayton is worth staying at.,"Checked in at 3, reception was very helpful, they even printed something for me to do with work at no charge. Room is very spacious and comfortable. Shower gel, soap and shampoo provided in mini bottles upon arrival. Used the Globe bar for dinner and it was outstanding service, Kevin in the bar was so helpful for me as I have a dairy intolerance, very patient with all my questions. The food was amazing and a good size portions, I was unable to finish my main.
My only problem is paying 6 euros per night to park as a guest, I think you should have free parking if you pay for a room.
Al in all a very pleasant place to stay.",5,2018,09,09
249,Convient location,We were collected from the airport and taken to the hotel were we had an easy and quick check in. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the airport. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. The hotel is situated a short walk awy from the Liffey Valley mall which has some nice restaurants if you dont want to eat in the hotel. Breakfast was good and the staff were helpful and friendly. I was very disappointed by the fact that we had to pay for parking on the hotel premises.,3,2018,09,09
249,Mr McBride,Regular business visitor to Clayton Liffey valley. A really friendly atmosphere and polite and helpful staff especially big little Kev in the bar. Highly recommended. Check in staff and breakfast staff always happy to help. ,5,2018,09,05
249,All-Ireland stay,I stayed here for a few days for a match in Croke park and I couldn't be happier. The hotel is only 30 minutes away from Croke park with a bus only minutes from the hotel. The staff were also extremely friendly and helpful (shoutout to Chris and Andrew in particular). The food was great during breakfast and the service was brilliant  and the young man at reception was amazing too when checking in ( I think his name was Eoin). Thank you for great stay and I hope to return soon.,5,2018,09,04
249,Dublin mini break,"Great stay at the hotel, pretty easy to get the bus to the city centre and great shops and restaurants nearby. The two Sharons are lovely girls who go out of their way to make you happy. We had a great stay and would come back. ",5,2018,09,02
249,Good hotel,I recently stayed here with my father while visiting family so we didn’t spend a lot of time in the hotel there were some aspects of the hotel which were both good and bad. We really enjoyed the breakfast in the hotel as we found it very peaceful and the staff were very friendly(especially Andrew and Binta). The atmosphere around the hotel was also very good but we were not happy with the room. It was very warm and we could not open the window because we were beside the noisy highway. Otherwise we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.,4,2018,09,02
249,Excellent Stay,"We stayed recently as a couple to head to a GAA match at Croke Park. This hotel was perfect for us. We decided on location as it was so easy to get to from the M50. Parking was great, just at the front door. Check is was so friendly, with a young man who seemed to be training, but was so professional. He seemed genuinely interested in us checking in, not the usual hotel script.
Our room was on the ground floor, but was so comfy and the beds were great (we slept like babies). Our trip to Croke was a 15 mins taxi, which the reception team orgainsed hassle free. 
The next morning for breakfast we were greeted by such a friendly team in the restaurant. The food was amazing and such a huge selection. I loved the sausages! 
The manager Paul went around each table asking how everyone’s night was, he couldn’t have done more for us! Such a great guy and the team was managed so well. 
We didn’t use the pool but went for a nosy, it was huge! (And their gym looked so modern!)
Perfect if you are bringing kids down for an escape away. 
There is a shopping centre about 10 minute walk and was great for us to get new clothes.

I’m already planning my next visit down to Liffey Valley 😃",5,2018,08,31
249,Last night of a travel through northern Ireland,"staff very friendly - especially Mr. Kalid, the manager on duty in the very early morning of Aug. 29th.
Because the hotel is located near the highway it is noisy also in the night, so you can't enjoy sleeping with windows open - what is our favourite 
the service in the restaurant is very quick and attentive",4,2018,08,31
249,Great hotel,Had a great stay here last week. The receptionist was very helpful upon arrival while breakfast was very welcoming every morning with Sharon and Andrew helping me each day. Ben was very pleasant at dinner also. The hotel is in a great location and I really enjoyed my short but pleasant stay.i will definitely stay again soon.,4,2018,08,30

249,Birthday Party,"My family had a big birthday bash at the venue. Excellent staff and facilities. Staff (Keith, Stephen and Helena) could not do enough to organise and cater on the night looked after our every need to make sure the celebration went off without a hitch. Highly recommended",5,2018,08,27
249,Short family break,"We had a fantastic stay here from 22nd to 24th of august  this year to visit family and to do a tour. The hotel was busy but the staff we encountered managed to make us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. Special mention to Ben, Sharon and Jamie  who looked after us at our evening meal and breakfast. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All the staff are a credit to their management team and whilst I'm sure everyone is the same these 3 stood out.  The room was booked for 3 and we had been put into an apartment so it was a lovely surprise.  Everything was was spotless and the beds were so comfy. I can't find any faults and would recommend to anyone wanting to stay. Far enough away from city center with great local bus links. Keep up the good work x",5,2018,08,27
249,Standard Hote,"Travel a lot with work and found this hotel was very busy and very like a work type hotel. Stayed with my partner as we were going to a gig in the city. Took over half an hour to check in. Receptionist wasn't very friendly or helpful. Took us about 15mins to find our room. Two lifts, and a long walk to find it. Bit of a trek to get to the pool from your room. Especially with people trying to check in and people rushing to conferences and you walking through with your swimwear and towel. Its very much a business type hotel with people coming and going. I wouldn't be staying here if you want a night away to relax but is fine if your just passing through.",3,2018,08,27
249,Sisters 40th birthday,"Hi All, we had my sister's surprise 40th birthday recently in the Clayton hotel Liffey Valley, from the time of booking the staff were absolutely brilliant, my brother in law and I booked it with Stephen who was friendly and professional, when he went on annual leave it was Helena who was in contact with us the whole time and she was absolutely brilliant, super friendly and helpful. Daniella in booking was also another super staff member, on the night Keith was very efficient and friendly, the bar staff were also brilliant (I don't know their names) the manager Jamie was another champion, I would like to mention Payal when checking in she was so helpful and polite and so friendly. There are other members of staff I don't know their names but all of them were brilliant, I could not fault any of them.
Thank you all for a great experience on having a party there, my sister and all the guests had a spectacular night, I would definitely be going back. Carolyn & John",5,2018,08,27
249,Business Meetings,"Irish Prestige Signs Ltd uses the Clayton frequently for business meetings and is always delighted with the excellent customer care provided by the staff.

249,Recommended ......,"Firstly this is 100% genuine and solely my opinion.
I have recently stayed here for several days and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
My room was very comfortable with a lovely comfortable bed and good decor.
I dined here most nights and the food was above average.I particularly liked the seafood linguine.Perhaps the menu could be extended a little as I was running out if different meals to have.
The hotel has a lovely swimming pool area.
Breakfast was nice too with a special welcome from Sharon who was always very welcoming.
I would not hesitate to return and I can see why the shares of this group Dalata are currently rated as a strong buy.",4,2018,08,24
249,Good hotel,"Have stayed here on a couple of occasions over the last few weeks.Conveniently located just off the M50 it’s a fine hotel and perfect for business clients.
Rooms are clean and comfortable, there is a warm welcome at reception, had food in the bar on two occasions which was fine. Bar is lacking somewhat in atmosphere but does the job. Breakfast was good with plenty of options available. Staff were friendly and helpful.
All in all a decent option when trying to delve through the myriad of options available when looking for a room online.",4,2018,08,24
249,GREAT TRIP,"Stayed here a few weeks back, nice rooms, helpful staff, lovely swimming pool. We had two kids with us, the restaurant staff were brilliant with them especially ""big"" Kevin. We had a great time. We will definitley return.",5,2018,08,24

249,Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley,"This is my second visit for work to the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley and both stays have been excellent, booking in and out was easy and quick. The reception staff are knowledgeable, professional and very friendly. Always smiling and very chatty, making you feel very welcome. The rooms are very clean and spacious, had everything you need even down to soap, shampoo etc... if you'd forgotten yours. As I travel for Business there are plenty of sockets around the room to plug your equipment into. Bed was very comfortable and gave a good nights sleep. Both visits I have eaten in the bar and the food, service and value for money is excellent I couldn't fault mine.
I will definitely be visiting again for work as it is close by to many shops and only 15mins into Dublin, Great place to stay.",5,2018,08,23
249,Good business hotel,"Spacious and clean. Good buffet breakfast with large selection. Dinner was bland (served to a group in a separate room), and the boxed breakfast (for early start of the day) was poor and sub-standard.",4,2018,08,22
249,Friendly staff and great location,"I recently stayed in the hotel with my son when going to a match. We stayed for a few days and had a great experience. The staff were extremely friendly especially Coco in the bar and Andrew at breakfast. They both were extremely friendly and easy to talk to. The food was very good in all areas of the hotel also. I also had some help from Amanda at the reception who was very helpful in helping us find our way around the city centre. The pool is also really good and the room was perfect, beds were super comfortable. The hotel is in an ideal location and I would definitely be back here for any event that is in Dublin.",4,2018,08,19
249,Sleep the sleep of the just,"The rooms here are spotless. Beds are so comfortable and cosy once you’re in them all you can do is sleep and awake refreshed. The staff are cheerful and helpful at reception. The health spa is very clean and professional very relaxing. If you are going to have dinner in the Italian restaurant think ahead and book well in advance. We didn’t and had to go to the bar. We sat ages for menus, drinks orders, and food orders. communication regarding food available on evening meal deals was not offered it had to be extracted. Food delivery was intermittent. The restaurant was untidy at best. The bar was covered in dirty plates and glasses. When the bill was requested it took 40 minutes. It was such a let down. Breakfast however in the other restaurant was superb.",3,2018,08,19
249,Good for families,"Have stayed here a number of times with family when visiting Dublin. Very good location which is one of the major attractions. Disappointed to be charged for parking, i can understand a city center location charging for parking but this far outside the city leaves a sour taste. Breakfast was good and overall service was excellent, especially Oisin during breakfast service. Pool was great and my kids very much enjoyed it. One disappointing aspect is the bar area. It is way too small relative to the size of the hotel and the number of guests and very difficult to find a seat as there are many bus tours that stay here which makes it very busy. The bar staff were rushed off their feet and wait time to get served was unacceptably long. Would give a 3.5 rating if i could and while 4 is a bit generous, a rating of 3 would be unfair given the friendliness of the staff.",4,2018,08,19
249,"Great Staff,","Stayed here for a family break, for 2 nights and had a great stay a big thank you to both Sharon's in the Globe Bar, and Kevin in the restaurant, also to Nadine when checking in at reception, all rallied around to make our stay that bit better, will definitely be staying again.",5,2018,08,17
249,Two night stay,"Thanks for much to the Clayton for a great two night stay. The staff went out of their way to help us even though the hotel was very busy. The good was lovely each day. The only improvement I could see would be to have kids toys in the pool. We went to the pool both days with two children,any other pool we went to in the past had buckets and water toys there. Thanks again for a great stay.",4,2018,08,17
249,It's OK,"Pros:  Got a well appointed suite with sofa bed in the living room which was great value for a family of 3.

Cons:  It's outragous that they charge for parking in a hotel that is not in the city-centre.  This is a very family-centric hotel so there are lots (and lots) of kids everywhere - the bar and restaurant were extremely noisy and unappealing.  There was a massive queue for breakfast and the food was a bit hit and miss.

This is a decent option for families looking for value in the greater Dublin area, but I woudn't recommend it to anyone else.",3,2018,08,16
249,Daughter's Christening,"I had my daughter's christening & stayed in the hotel, first off I would like to thank Paul and his team Keith, Daniel & Nadine first class service & going that extra mile for our family. The facilities at this hotel are first class from dining in the restaurant to the breakfast & Pool & Fitness, one of the best hotels we have stayed in a long time would highly recommend this hotel to enjoy a break away with family & friends.",5,2018,08,15
249,GREAT STAY,"I stayed for 2 nights bed and breakfast with my 4yr old, the check in procedure was fine , they lady was extremely helpful and friendly. I think her name was Tammy. Our room was on the 1st floor it was good only issue was the connecting doors than that spotless , comfy bedding even a fridge , we ordered room service after spending and hour or two at the pool and this arrived within the 30 mins piping hot and everything we asked for. The hotel was very busy but I don't think this is an issue I think it adds the buzz especially for the little ones availing of the Tayto park packages , loads of little children like my own daughter excited and busy about the hotel and pool. Breakfast was 10/10 both mornings not a single complaint yes it was busy but nothing serious , lots of choice for children and piping hot breakfasts too,,, overall I plan to return before my little one starts school as perfect little treat.",4,2018,08,13
249,"Lovely Hotel with a Pool, a Great Breakfast & A1 Staff","The hotel was lovely and very clean. The staff were friendly and willing to help make your stay was enjoyable as possible. 

The Plus Points
- Great clean hotel with clean family room, en-suite with toiletries provided.
- Pool available for the use of residents.
- Great buffet style breakfast.
-Within walking distance of a bus stop to get the bus into Dublin city centre.
-The staff, very friendly and they provide a good service.
-Newspapers available for guests.
-Taxis and shuttle bus available at a fee.

Negatives
- You have to purchase swimming caps to use the pool - tip - bring some with you.
- Hotel can be used for events and celebrations - this meant there were children running up and down the bedroom corridor screaming one night. However, after phoning reception the staff sorted it and it was then quiet.
-The location - although you can get a bus nearby, we would have preferred somewhere nearer to the city centre (would be better if you had a car).
-Tip - buses do not accept notes, so you will need plenty of change if taking the local buses.
- Taxis appeared to be very expensive - would take local transport or a hire car.",3,2018,08,13
249,Expected More! ,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week with my wife and son.
We stayed on the 1st Floor but its quite a walk to the lifts to get there.
Room was ok but NO Air Conditioning, we had to leave the window and door onto the balcony open overnight as the room was so hot.
On the 1st night we ate in the Italian restaurant...... What a rip off!
Almost 16 Euros for a soggy Pizza and the kids menu was terrible.
Breakfast was good with plenty of choice but very busy.
I was also shocked that it was 6 Euros per night to use the hotel carpark.
In my opinion the Hotel could have been alot better considering the price.
Location is good but sadly for us that was all! ",3,2018,08,11
249,Laura,"I recently stayed at the hotel with my family and it was absolutely beautiful. The offer with Tayto park was amazing.
The staff where very friendly especially Paul the manager.
The food was beautiful and had plenty to choose from..I will definitely be back.",5,2018,08,08
249,Nice and clean - exactly what it should be. ,"I stayed here the ladt weekend with my 2 kids and husband. Check in was fine, bit longer than needed but it was fine. We got 2 VIP passports for the kids to complete but we didn't get around to it. The room was nice and clean, exactly what it should be. It was an interconnected room, the door was locked, however the kids kept knocking on it so I'd imagine annoying the neighbouring room. The only downside to the room was the lack of air conditioning. It was very warm!! The swimming pool and area was really clean, nice but very busy. Again no fault of the hotel. Breakfast time was quite busy, thankfully we got down before the major rush. Alot of choice. The kids enjoyed their stay! Unfortunately my husband and I didn't sleep too well given the heat but again it was fine. ",4,2018,08,08
249,Overnight stay,"Hotel staff extremely helpful and welcoming
Breakfast was a diaster with food debris on the floor around the area and unpleasant to look at.
Room was nice but small window allowed a tiny amount of air in on an extremely hot day
",3,2018,08,07
249,7 months of stays here - mostly good with a few exceptions!,"Just completed 7 months work in Ireland which involved staying here every week for anything up to 4 nights per week. Since my original review things have improved in many ways but there have been the odd issues - Most of the hotels i have stayed at during the hot spell have ensured there was water with ice available either on check in or brought to my room with no charge. At he liffey valley several times recently i was quoted a room service charge of 5 euros even though my company had spent over 25,000 euros in bookings for me alone in the past months.......OK thats one of the frustration things.
On the plus side once i had been 'allocated' room 115 for my bookings things improved.
Service by the regular reception staff was very good and only an issue when the hotel moved new staff in who had yet been training. The restaurant served regularly good food - my only issue is that after 7 month, i was so bored of the same menu!
Help from one of the managers, Kevin, did take away some issues and from time to time his humour helped a lot - thanks.
Breakfast was also well delivered even if from time to time the screaming babies was a noise issue but the service from Sharon and Jamie was very good, in fact talking with sharon every morning did brighten up the day.
The hotel does offer a great deal beyond being 750mtr from my office - the rooms were adequate (powerful shower) with tea/coffee making (but no iced water) and UK TV stations, Good under ground parking which helped when the snows came in march. On the down side i would expect a hotel of this standard to have Air Con but maybe no one expected these recent temps.
Overall my stay improved over the months and the general good nature of the staff (lets ignore the maintenance man who lacked customer relations handling skills) and management made 7 months away from home more manageable.
Thanks for the stay and maybe i will be back some time.
PS - the final nights delivery of a mug with Room 115 on it was a nice touch too!",4,2018,08,06
249,Globe ,"Had a lovely meal over the weekend in Globe and tried something different and as usual good was super,hotel looking great with some new decor and staff can't fault! Kevin, Ina,Coco,Nathalie to mention a few and the Sharon's!😂  staff make a place oh and the food! V happy customer

249,"Carlsberg don't do Bar Staff, but if they did...","It's my local for a few pints, but not only do they serve a cracking pint of Carlsberg, the staff in the Bar are tops! Kevin and CO  will look after you for the evening. Big shout out to all the lads and ladies behind the bar..  Keep serving the nice pints ",5,2018,08,05
249,My favourite hotel,"Love this hotel. This is our 3rd year here and I cannot fault it. We have 3 small kids and it's just ideal. Only hotel in Ireland I feel fully comfortable in as they are so welcoming with children. There's plenty there to do with kids and staff are welcoming in all areas of the hotel. Good breakfast and love gusto restaurant. Credit due to all staff. Friendly and approachable. All in all, a fab hotel which I highly recommend",5,2018,08,04
249,2 nights stay,"Stayed in family room lovely and comfy 1 double and 2 single beds but no air con ridiculous as the rooms were so hot even though we had a fan
We couldn't sleep properly because of the heat. Did say reception but told nothing they could do but the up side lovely hotel lovely staff and nice pool

249,One Night Birthday Stay With Bf,"As soon as we arrived we were informed There was no Rooms For us that they had apologised and had to upgrade us to an apartment
OMG it's so much better than a room.. We had a bed room sitting room kitchen utility room wow so so worth it
Staff were helpful
",5,2018,08,04
249,Great stay,We stayed for just one night in a family room. Staff were excellent and could not be more helpful from reception to room service to breakfast in the morning.  Beds were super comfy. Only reason I have not rated five is the lack of ac in the rooms. Room was uncomfortably warm with four in the room overnight and only one small window to open. ,4,2018,08,03
249,You have to stay here,OK first up I stayed here 4 years ago and was happy.....just about to finish a 3 night break here with my family and I have to say it has been brilliant...hotel very clean and staff amazing I have to give big credit to gusto staff Oana and Mahen who just served us at dinner....nothing was too much for them and we had a great meal with very attentive staff...all in a great stay and we will be back.....soon..Ali..Lorraine ...Ella and Tilly,5,2018,08,02
249,Certain things make a huge difference ,"I am currently staying in the hotel and do so regularly throughout the year.  Since it has been taken over by Carlton, the standard and hospitality of the employees has vastly improved. 
The reception staff were welcoming happy and very nice on checking in. Nothing could be any trouble, and they seemed both helpful and relaxed in dealing with your needs/requests. Especially Amanda. Big smile, and a bubbly personality.
At breakfast, the staff said good morning every day I entered the room and one particular lady, Sharon O even remembered I had coffee and asked if I’d like my usual poached eggs before I’d even sat at my table. I found this very impressive and homely.
The bar staff have took it to a higher level too with the charismatic and very humorous Kevin, who with his professionalism and lighthearted sarcasm, was entertaining to be served by. Had me in stitches most nights. Then there is Natalie, who I’ve got to know over the repeated visits, who was as always, pleasant, hospitable and even asked how my family was doing, from a previous visit conversation we had had. 

The only reason I’ve not give the review a 5 is due to the beds. The mattress is like sleeping on the floor and takes me 10/15 to straighten up once awake. But, this could be just me, some people may prefer that type of bed to sleep in. 

Very impressed overall and look forward to many future visits.",4,2018,08,02
249,Event held and booked some rooms,"Most amazing customer service received from the staff. Had an event and the staff worked so hard to make sure that the event went well. Huge thank you to Stephen Coogan best event organizer I have ever met, best staff to work with Kieth, Daniel, Jamie and Amanda🙌🙌",5,2018,08,01
249,Christening party,"I had my daughters christening last weekend and the staff couldn't be anymore helpful, I would definitely recommended the Clayton for a function my guests said the day was perfect from start to finish and it was all down to the staff so thanks again",5,2018,07,31
249,Cold and unfriendly,"Stayed here for a few nights with my family and it wasnt a nice stay,bed sheets had blood stains,full irish was poor to say the least,family was cramped and stuffy,never again.food and empty wine glasses left outside room doors for ages on end and kids coming and going to their rooms,neglegence",1,2018,07,29
249,Very Pleasant Stay,"Have stayed here many times before when it was the Clarion, this was our first stay since the hotel changed ownership. Our family room was spacious and very clean, breakfast was very busy, but thoroughly enjoyable, although we did have to chase down someone to get tea/coffees, but given how busy this hotel is it really is a minor issue (beverages arrived immediately once we asked). Will not hesitate to book again. The location is perfect for shopping or accessing most of the family orientated attractions in Dublin, it’s also only 20minutes drive to Tayto park. The reception team are all very pleasant, a special thanks to Amanda for her kindness towards our son. We look forward to returning.",5,2018,07,28
249,Customer service was awful!,"We stayed here at the start of the month for a concert and chose the hotel as we had stayed here 2 years prior for a similar situation and it went well....times have most certainly changed!  I arrived to check-in and the entire check-in process with Piroska was awful.  She had zero interest, I found her very unhelpful and she was very sarcastic in some of her responses to any questions I asked.  She couldn't find my reservation so we had to be put in an apartment even though I had a double room booked since January.  This set the mood for our stay really and was on my mind all day.  Then, on checkout we had to stand in the lobby for 15 minutes while someone went to make sure the apartment was okay which I found embarrassing as I watched numerous check-outs and not one other room/apartment had to wait.  Lastly, I was not even asked how our stay was as I would have expressed my concerns then so instead I decided to wait and privately review and I have still not even had a response!  Overall the customer service is clearly an issue and people should not have to leave feeling these ways, especially after paying €199 for one night, room only!!",2,2018,07,28
249,Lovely,"Lovely hotel, rooms clean and comfortable. Great location for shopping and attractions, only downside was dinner in the restaurant.  Badly organised, cold food and long wait.  The waitress Tracey was polite and doing an amazing job but had it all to do herself. ",5,2018,07,27
249,Stay was just ok,"Arrived on Sunday 15th July for 2 nights with my family. Upon arrival at check in it was obvious this was a very busy hotel. We checked in, got to our room and we were happy enough with it. Used the pool then headed to the bar for a drink, wanted food so we were showed to a table in globe restaurant at 6pm. At 6.20 my husband had to go and ask for menus. At 6.50 he then had to go and ask for someone to take our order. There were 4 other tables occupied so it wasn't busy. Food was ok staff weren't overly friendly and not once during the meal were we asked was everything ok.
Monday morning we left our room at 9.45am and put the ready for cleaning sign out. 5.30pm we returned and the room hadn't been done. We needed towels, house keeping didn't arrive until 6.25pm. Where upon the person knocked the door, asked did we need towels, they were replaced, then the bin was emptied. That was it. At 7pm we had to go and ask for toilet paper. Not acceptable from a 4* hotel. 
Overall our stay was ok, food was good, service wasn't so good. Don't think we'd return here again. 
In my opinion also, I don't think the hotel should be charging €6 per night for parking. We weren't aware of this, when we arrived the barrier was up so we didn't get a ticket. We were baffled then on Monday as to how we were supposed to get out. It wasn't until I asked at reception that we had to pay a ticket which we didn't have.",3,2018,07,24
249,Awful dont book,"Ment to stay here for 2 nights with my husband and 2 young kids in the execitve suit. On the first night we asked for a refund for the following night it was so bad.
Don't book huge waste of money and a total disappointment.",1,2018,07,22
249,Great Hotel,"This was my first time staying in the Clayton Hotel, and I was very impressed. The staff went out of their way to help you, especially the manager, Paul, he really made our stay here special. The room was perfect, everything you could need and the hotel restaurant was one of the best i’ve tried. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,20
249,Fantastic hotel ,"This is my 2nd time staying with the clayton and I can promise you they never disappoint. The rooms are beautiful, the staff are excellent, a special thanks must go to the manager Paul, from the moment we arrived he done everything he could to make our stay a special one. Everything is so handy to this hotel, the shopping centre is close by, walking distance away and the restaurant in the hotel does the best pizzas in town! I will definitely be returning to Liffey Valley and to this great hotel. ",5,2018,07,20
249,Amazing,My 2nd time staying here while in Dublin for work. And both times were fantastic. The food in both restaurants is out of this world. And every single staff member is polite and helpful and a pleasure to deal with. I look forward to my next stay!! ,5,2018,07,16
249,Terrible experience,"Spent two nights in this hotel and was thoroughly disapointed. We arrived half an hour after check-in to find our room wouldnt be ready for another hour and a half. After complaining and speaking to a manager we were given a voucher for 3 free drinks but the bar staff ignored us and left us waiting half an hour before eventually we didnt have time to get our drink.

When we finally got our room, the bed throw was dirty and the duvet was put sideways into the sheets. Wasn't cleaned well at all.

When booking taxis to and from Marley Park the receptionist, who wasnt in training, didnt seem to have any idea what he was doing. He ended up not booking enough taxis for us to get there and then our return taxis never showed up, leaving a group of young girls stranded in Dublin in a completely unfamiliar area. The receptionists were extremely unhelpful and didnt give us as much as a number to call.

If I'm paying 300 euro to stay in a hotel I expect far better treatment and service than what we were given. The staff didnt seem to care about the quality of the service they provided. Will absolutely never be wasting my money on this hotel again.",1,2018,07,15
249,Liffey Valley,"Had a lovely time here. We stayed 2 nights and got use of the pool which was great for the kids. The staff are lovely and helpful especially Kevin o Reilly assistant bar manager who helped my kids fill in the task sheets which they were given on arrival and kept them busy and excited for a time. Kevin even listened to them talk about the fun day they had at tayto Park. Thanks Kevin
Will definitely be back and have stayed here numerous times before. 
Thanks guys",5,2018,07,14
249,Great stay,"Stayed for one night check in was very busy but efficient, The receptionist Paula checked myself and husband in lovely girl she was very professional and worked well under pressure. We dined in the restaurant Gusto and the food was fantastic I had chicken wings to start fish for mains my husband had the steak for main cooked prefectly, and the waiting staff were very pleasant and helpful, beds are extremly comfortable and room was spotless. We will definitely return",5,2018,07,14
249,Never again,"Booked self catering apartment year before our stay. Arrived to be told no apartment available. Double booked. Put in executive suite for one night which was lovely and would be upgraded to penthouse for last two nights of stay which we thought would be fantastic. So after being out with three kids all day we arrived back at hotel with 60e worth of food to be cooked in kitchen. Got to penthouse to find a filthy kitchen with no utensils, pots or pans to cook food. Spoke to reception to be told they had to be prebooked which we were never told off.they eventually agreed to supply utensils but after an hour of waiting still nothing. It is 8.30pm at this stage, kids crying because of hunger, so we decide to go to reception and speak to manager. Manager arrives dirty jacket and promises to get them to us, which after 10mins they arrive and we finally get to cook food. But at this stage kids have had sandwiches and are in bed as we have to be on road at 7am.  No bins, dish cloths, nothing. We coming to Dublin for last 15years staying in different hotels and this as been the worst experience so far.",1,2018,07,14
249,Great for a family break!,"Stayed here for two nights with their great family deal- 2 nights for 2 adults and 2 children with full breakfast, 3 course dinner on one night and tickets to Dublin Zoo included. Staff were so friendly and accommodating especially as my children are small and we were also travelling with a 4 week old infant. We ate in the hotel on both nights. Food was lovely and reasonably priced. The outdoor playground and use of the swimming pool kept the kids happy and daddy even caught the World Cup game in the bar!! Dublin zoo is fantastic and you should spend the whole day there to really have the chance to see everything then head back to the hotel to relax! Will definitely be back in the future. ",5,2018,07,11
249,Perfect for Business and Leisure,"Stayed for 4 nights with my wife and daughter. I was attending a business seminar as well as a family leisure weekend. The meeting room was large, spacious, and comfortable. The lunch was held in the restaurant and it was cooled to perfection.
As a family we had a great time. The bedroom was large, the reservations team gave us an upgrade of a balcony room. The room was large comfortable and had a large double and a single bed.. The only down fall of our stay was the comfort of the bed, both beds were old and had a huge hollow in the centre but of they had new matresses the stay would be 10/10
The staff were brilliant, all staff in every department, reception, housekeeping, bar, leisure and restaurant were all welcoming, genuine and professional. They are all a credit to the hotel. Friendly helpfull staff make a huge difference and make it a good experience. 
The food is excellent, from breakfast in the restaurant, lunch and dinner in the bar and dinner in the restaurant, its all excellent. We had no complaints with any of the food or drink.
We also got tickets for Tayto Park and Dublin Zoo as part of our package. This was very handy and the hotel is located in a great location with easy access to both places and easy access to Dublin city. The hotel is also located beside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and cinema complex which has something for everybody.
We will be back and we would highly recommend The Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley for business and leisure.",5,2018,07,10
249,Great food and staff,Stayed at Clayton Liffey after a trip to Dublin Zoo.  Super handy and comfortable with pool and play area for the kids.  The food and staff in the kudos bar were great so big thanks gents for the fantastic service.,4,2018,07,10
249,Bloom Birthday Weekend,"Came here as a group of 4 sisters, as one was celebrating her birthday. One sister arrived first and when checking in was asked if we had children with us... we had 2 twin rooms booked... when she replied we were 4 adults she was immediately upgraded to 2 of the apartments. This was a wonderful surprise as we now all had our own room and bathroom, plus kitchen, dining room and lounge. The rooms were spotless and nicely decorated. It was a lovely weekend, made all the better by our hotel stay",4,2018,07,10
249,Only ok,"Considering we got it last minute and the hotel was cheap, we got exactly what we paid for then. Wouldn’t come here again for the lack of friendly staff and breakfast isn’t great. 
Has a wide variety but the Irish breakfast was freezing cold. 
No staff member that we encountered took any interest in us, no small talk or even was everything ok at each meal from reception, bar, breakfast to the pool. 
The swimming pool is a good size for families and had great changing room facilities. We went down first thing when it was open for kids and had a great time, wasn’t too busy then. 
Overall the place is clean and if it’s location your looking for it’s perfect. Look for a deal when booking. 
It has Liffey valley shopping center right beside it and the zoo is only a short drive away. 

",3,2018,07,09
249,Great food and fantastic staff,We spent Thursday shopping in Dublin and decided to eat at the Clayton Hotel.  The hotel was spotless and the food was exceptional.  We travel a fair bit throughout the Country and abroad and have never before encountered such wonderful staff.  We highly recommend this hotel for great food and wonderful staff.,5,2018,07,07
249,"Fantastic and very consistent, long time review..","I have stayed here before with the family for a mid week break where we used the two night, b&b, dinner and zoo package which was great for everyone and simplified the stay when you have two young kids in toe. From the rooms to the food, the service and facilities it adds to the experience making a real difference and making it more like a relaxing break with the kids which is a hard blend to get right. Generally kids and relaxing don't mix! Personally too I've have now been using this place for corporate bookings (probably booked about 30rooms) this year so I feel I am in a strong place to give an accurate comment on the hotel as it's not just me that has stayed here but lots of my colleagues too! I have stayed here numerous times I 
the last few months but also everyone that I book in that has stayed here has always great feedback about the hotel which is much better than the previous hotels we used to use. This is great to hear as we spend a lot of money on accomodation for our colleagues and here we get great value for money and I will continue to use this place going forward. Well done Clayton Liffey Valley, keep up the fantastic work! Kind regards, Oisin.",5,2018,07,07
249,Would highly recommend ,"Stayed here with my wife and two young children (6 and 3) for two nights mid week. The accommodation was great with nice big beds, plenty of storage and the usual setup of TV, great shower etc. There wasn’t any air conditioning but a fan had been supplied and was great. 

The car park was a good size and had a lift up to reception. It wasn’t free but was reasonably priced and as the hotel also caters for a lot of events I could understand the charge. 

We did use the swimming facilities and generally enjoyed the pool. Our only criticism here would be the lack of information about their setup. Towels are provided to hotel guests free of charge. But we were told that we would have to purchase swimming caps to use the pool. I’d like this information to have been provided before hand so that we avoided the embarrassment of trying to scrape together the unexpected cost for four caps. Then we were told we would also have to pay a deposit of €5 for each padlock for the locker rooms. Other than this I would recommend using the gym/pool while staying here. 

We ate in the Italian restaurant in the hotel and found the food to be of a very high standard. I had the Bolognese and it was lovely. The kids menu offered good choice and the portions seemed ample and the twelve inch pizzas looked very authentic. 
Again, our only issue was upon arriving at our table. The server came over almost immediately and asked what we would like to drink. At this point, we had not even been handed a drinks menu. I asked her what lager/beer they had. The server said she thought they might have Heineken and added they had the usual stuff. She then didn’t know what ciders might be on offer when asked by my wife and had to go and find out. I do think that drinks are something a server should know in a restaurant. 

These are very minor things and it wouldn’t put me off staying at this hotel again in the future. 

The breakfast selection was typical for a hotel but well executed and definitely helped to set us all up for our days ahead. 
The hotel was buzzing, vibrant and full of life which I always like to see. It clearly caters for all types with families, couples, groups and business people all sharing the bright and airy setting. ",4,2018,07,06
249,Short stay over June bank holiday,"Couldn't believe there was no air conditioning in the room. Having a big fan is not practical in a small room with kids. Also kids fold up bed was at an angle and no headboard so poor set up over all. 
Thought food in restaurant was poor. Overall wouldn't return. ",3,2018,07,05
249,Disappointing,"We stayed in early June and were disappointed with several elements of the hotel.

1. The hotel has an in-house Italian restaurant called Gusto.  Much of the branding shouts about 'authentic' Italian experience - this is taken to extremes by the restaurant choosing to play terrible 80s Italian euro-pop music by Toto Cutugno on loop.  It's naff and loud.  We asked our waiter if there was any chance it could be changed and he said something like ""no, we have to play it as it's Italian and it's worse for us as we have listen to it every day"".  How strange.  they could have a much cooler playlist with some nice Italian influences.

2. Authentic Italian didn't count with the food though, oh no.  We were given a chicken ceaser salad with spicy cajan chicken.  

We called the waiter over and said that the chicken was strangely spicy and he said they had run out of plain chicken so they replaced with with cajan chicken (without telling us). 

3. The bill came, we were asked if everything was Ok, we pulled a face and said no not really, explained why.  We could see managers discussing it, but no-one came over, no attempt to make it right.  

4. We booked a family room with a double for us and sofa bed for the two kids.  When we arrived late in the evening, every drawer and wardrobe door was pulled open (?) and the sofa bed was not made up.  We also only had towels and shampoo for 2.  they obviously missed our booking was for a family.  it took AGES to get someone to make the bed with bedding, pillows etc.  

5. Check-in was poor.  Receptionist took far to long looking silently at her screen doing things.  a poor welcome, leaving us standing dumb for several minutes.

6. Breakfast, much is made of the Vitality Breakfast, with images on menus of amazing looking healthy concoctions, none of these items were available.

7. Pool is nice but very busy at weekends, with locals and swimming classes.  We had a very small square bit to use.  Also, the sauna has a sign that kids are allowed under adult supervision and another sign that says they are not.   Our kids only wanted to come in for a minute to experience it of course, but it's annoying that we were told off even though there is a signs.  there are LOTS of signs in that swimming pool area.",1,2018,06,27
249,Brilliant weekend away,"Me and my friends booked in for a weekend away few weeks ago.
The service and the staff was superb from start to finish. We received a complimentary upgrade as it was one of our friends birthday. The girl on reception Pirska (I think) was very informative about the facilities. We had a small issue in our room but the manager on the front desk was very helpful.
Had a lovely meal in Gusto, where we were grated by Kevin who is a gem to the place.
Had no time to use the gym, but definitely be back and will try it.",5,2018,06,27
249,lovely stay,"had a lovely stay in the clayton hotel liffey valley. lovely food, lovely room and friendly staff. Had several queries regarding places of interest and found Christina very helpful and informative. would definitely come again.",1,2018,06,26
249,Really friendly staff and good facilities,"This hotel is a quick bus ride away from Dublin City Centre, it has great facilities including a well equipped gym and swimming pool.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful, in particular Sharon our breakfast waitress.",5,2018,06,25
249,Lovely hotel,I stayed here at the last minute and got the room for €79 .The hotel had alot of families staying as there is a swimming pool at the hotel .There is a bar and restaurant also .Liffey valley shopping centre is a 5 min walk away . The rooms were spacious with tea/coffee making facilities and there was a large double bed .,4,2018,06,24
249,What a disapointing start to our holiday in Ireland,"We stayed at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley as part of a Shearings Tour. After a very long wait for our rooms we went for our dinner in the restaurant. I appreciate on a coach holiday we are going to get different food from the main menu but what we were served (canteen fashion) was absolutely tasteless, unimaginative and no better than school dinners.   Other guests food looked really good.   So Clayton Hotels get your act together if you cant cater for coach parties dont take bookings for them.",2,2018,06,23
249,Good Hotel,"Hello again Peeps, 
I'm currently working in the ROI & have managed to secure accommodation at the Clayton Hotel. 
It's a busy hotel with many different nationalities of people staying here. 
There is a shuttle bus for the hotel to the Airport (and visa versa). 
The hotel has a very busy gym & nice pool which I have still to find time to enjoy .
There are two restaurants, one is an Italian and the other is the bar restaurant. Both reasonably priced to eat at for a Dublin hotel & the food is pretty good. You can eat outside the hotel at other eateries nearby but I've not managed to visit these due to time limits of my stay.
I would definitely recommend staying here as the rooms are good & the staff are friendly.
I've currently been here for 4 consecutive days & will be staying here in very near future again.
in my opinion its well worth a visit for a day or two or maybe even longer.
Again I'll add a further review on TA once I've stayed again for a period of time.
Feel free to ask any questions & I'll get back to you as quickly as possible with an answer.",4,2018,06,21
249,Convenient location,"We stayed here as part of a Shearings Group as it isn't far for the ferry transfer.  The hotel looks quite grand from the outside and the same inside, nice modern décor and very clean with all the mod cons you require in a hotel.  We had a three course meal which wasn't great,  unfortunately it is a business hotel as its all quick and easy without the quality.  Location was convenient but probably wouldn't return",3,2018,06,21
249,Overnight,"Stayed st this hotel on a Sunday night. Check in was quick and efficient. Room was clean, spacious and as requested very quiet. Went to the bar for a drink and some food. The noise level was incredible due in most part to music. Not live music but recorded. Supposed to be background music however it was anything but. We had to practically yell at each other to be heard. Suddenly it stopped. World Cup came on the TV. Usually this would be way louder, but not in this case. I hate football on TV but not in this case. It was a blessed relief. E.",3,2018,06,18
249,Iffey Valley- Iffy Experience,"Firstly, the room was excellent & the food was exceptional. Unfortunately this was let down massively by the service provided by the staff at all levels with the exception of one guy working the Globe Bar. There was no managerial guidance or motivation for the young uninterested 'shop floor' staff. There was no interaction from them to us the customer no matter how hard we tried. We were in room 325 & there was no plug in our sink, a minor problem quickly resolved? We reported the missing plug, we had a chain from which the plug should have been attached but no plug. 2 receptionists had to have the concept of a sink plug explained to them! We came back to find the chain had been removed but still no plug. We reported this & a chap who appeared to be in charge said it would be sorted immediately, no it wasn't & we left the hotel still not seeing our elusive sink plug! May I suggest that the management team at this hotel send representatives to the Dromhall Hotel Killarney( out next hotel on our tour) to see how a proper hotel trains it's staff. Hellos & conversations with every member we met during stay, much better than the monosyllabic grunts & complete indifference we experienced at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley.",3,2018,06,18
249,"Good, hotel - room for improvement","Large but nice hotel in the edge of Dublin City.
Rooms generally ok (stayed there many times - only had one duff room where I requested a move - to which they moved me without quibble).
Could do with a few more staff (they always seemed really busy).
Had one interesting experience with a rather rude bar man but there is a nicer bar just outside the hotel (slightly better food too!!).
A bit of internal maintenance and some staff training and I feel that this could easily become a top class hotel",3,2018,06,17
249,Excellent ,"Stayed here a few. Months ago , was ok only , however upon another trip this time round , so far has been a stellar experience. This hotel is so close to shopping centre and bus outside door , ample parking , room immaculate, staff super friendly esp the young gentleman in the bar , and one of the managers Chris most certainly is a very happy chap and makes sure your needs are met . I think the six euros parking is a small price to pay for an over night safe place in Dublin . We will most definitely return and recommend to anyone . ",5,2018,06,16
249,Receptionist was the best part of our stay!,"We had recently stayed at the Clayton in Sligo, it was such a fabulous stay that we decided to stay at another Clayton Hotel in Liffey Valley. We were greeted by a lovely young lady Amanda, she was extremely friendly and made our check in very easy. We had a nice family room on the second floor, that was clean and airy. Unfortunately that is the only nice things I can say about the rest of our stay. We ordered room service, the family pizza deal (luke warm & not very nice) and the staff member who delivered it wasn’t overly friendly. Then the kids (aged 12 & 5) and myself were woken by what can only be described as what sounded like very UN PG behaviour in the room next door late in the night. My daughter was extremely distraught by what she had heard and wanted to change rooms. I ended up staying up with the kids until past 1:30pm with the TV on as they couldn’t get back to sleep. Totally understand that couples need to enjoy their time away together but perhaps the Hotel could put their rooms away from the Family ones! 

So overall a very disappointing stay, no sleep and felt sick from the dinner. Such a shame because we really enjoyed our Clayton Sligo stay and were looking forward to the same in the Liffey Valley. 
",2,2018,06,14
249,Great hotel for a young family visit,"We are just home from a three night stay here and it was excellent value for money. The family room accommodated two adults and two small children comfortably and the breakfast was excellent. Our children loved the pools! 
The location was excellent - we went to tayto Park and the zoo and neither was more than 30mins by car from the hotel with the shopping centre a few minutes away too with shopping and lots of different places to eat : car parking on site was also a bonus 
Excellent service and attention from staff most notably Jamie in the breakfast room -he was extremely patience with two very small children . 
Will definitely return and our only negative was we’d have loved some air conditioning in the bedrooms as it has been warm but fans were provided to help and nothing was a bother to any of the staff",5,2018,06,13
249,Short but good stay ,It's nice hotel with big rooms and good area there is fan in room because some time it's bit hot here so aircondition is not req but fan is required I use that Windows can be open but u have to remove curtains so sun light comes in that case over all it's only one day stay here gym and swung pool is amazing you cannot say it's hotels gym it's lime big size professional gym ,4,2018,06,13
249,Disinterested staff made for a mediocre stay.,"My sister and I booked into the Clayton for one night so we could go to a gig in the city centre. The stay was overall okay but there were several factors that put a dampener on our stay:

Upon checking in the reception offered no information on breakfast times, facilities and overall seemed very curt and uninterested. We had to ring reception to ask these questions and they seemed put out by us enquiring. Check in was also very slow and awkward. 

Our room was fine but we discovered one of the mugs was filthy and it turned us off using the second mug. That evening we had a small meal in the bar. The staff again were very uninterested and stood around speaking to each other. When our order came to the table one of the dishes was missing key elements described on the menu. When we were told the chef didn’t have that ingredient. This would have been no problem at all if we had simply been told once the order was taken. They knew it was insufficient and sent the dish out anyway. They offered a substitute of either rolls or soda bread. We chose soda bread and were brought rolls instead. We were running late for the gig and did not have the time or patience to bring it to their attention. We recieved a small discount but the damage was done. There was a blonde woman who appeared to be a manager who was highly professional and tried to deal with the matter as best she could.
The food was average at best and not worth the inflated price tag. Salad was covered in mayonnaise and greasy and the portions were very small.

The leisure facilities were excellent. Had a great range of facilities and the employees were competent.

At check out no one enquired how our stay was.

We were looking forward to this stay for weeks and had expected for it to be the highlight of the visit. We enjoyed the leisure facilities but nothing else.",2,2018,06,11
249,Derek,"Lovely hotel, stayed in the Liffey Valley Suite which was brilliant, very clean, spacious and has every appliance you would need, great restaurant with great food, very impressed with the staff throughout the hotel, professional and spent effort to attend to every requirement,    the bar is very welcoming with a good atmosphere, all the bar staff are great and made my stay very pleasant especially Natalie who was brilliant, will definitely stay again.",5,2018,06,08
249,Good pay for the money,"Stayed here for a business trip for 5 days. Rooms were clean and cosy. The staff was always very helpful. Oana from the hotel’s restaurant helped create a very nice atmosphere during our breakfasts, always smiling and attentive. A good stay overall",4,2018,06,08
249,Mr,"Had a fabulous stay at the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley-rooms spotless, bus into city very close by. Breakfast was great. Staff friendly and very helpful thank you Amanda and Kevin, and Paul Truscott, I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2018,06,07
249,Adam Lacey,Hotel very clean and staff very friendly especially Natalie who works in the bar very charming and nothing but helpful....bar across the road quite nice...and cosmos is a lovely all you can eat restaurant less than five minutes walk away ,5,2018,06,07
249,Great Location  - Minor things that could be improved!,"We arrived home yesterday from a 2 night stay in the Clayton :) Myself, my partner, my 12 year old and 2 year old toddler stayed in one of the Executive suites. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were very nice and spacious! The staff seemed friendly too. We visited Tayto Park and Dublin Zoo during our stay and the location was excellent. We also took a trip down to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which was less than 2 minutes away. 
My only issue was the heat in the rooms........... There is no air conditioning in the rooms and we all struggled to sleep with the heat especially with me being 7 months pregnant, My 2 year old really struggled with the heat and was very congested because of it. We got speaking to another family who also found it very hard to sleep in their room because of the heat. Our room was also facing a really busy road so the noise all night was very loud. We had to close the window because the noise was waking our toddler but even closing the window didn't make a difference and made the room even warmer.
The swimming pool was good but the changing rooms were absolutely freezing. My 2 year old was shaking and crying while i was trying to get him dressed - It really wasnt very nice. The temperature really needs to be turned up in the changing rooms. 
Again, The hotel was very clean and in an excellent location and i think if anything could be done about the few minor things the hotel would get 5 stars from me :)",3,2018,06,06
249,Excellent stay for a Girlie night away!!!,"Myself and my friend stayed here for a one night girlie getaway/ Birthday celebration. We had a great time. I would like to thank Danielle Richie for organising the Apt for us. It was much appreciated as both us ladies were in matching PJ's and just chilling out by 11pm and just wanted to relax and chat. We Loved our 1 bed apt-staff put a roll out bed in the living room as I wanted my friend to have the bedroom and be comfortable-roll out bed was fine. The apt had amazing facilities if you needed them whilst on a Business trip or long stay with a family-fridge, toaster, microwave, oven,dishwasher, washing machine etc. We are already planning our next trip back in a few weeks!!! The Only negative was No AC in the apt-although it was Very hot for Ireland-I got two fans sent up which sorta solved the problem. I cannot wait to return again!!! XxX

249,Most relaxing night ever . ,"What a place to stay . We had an apartment for the night it was absolutely fantastic. So relaxing. The room was spotless and the living area and kitchen were so spacious. 
It’s situated by the motorway but noise was not a problem at all . 
Can not wait to return again , real soon . ",5,2018,06,05
249,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"A huge THANK YOU to Paul Truscott for helping my friends and I get a nice room. This is an EXCELLENT hotel. Great place to stay for families and couples alike. Delicious Irish fry, friendly staff, a 15 min bus ride to O’Connell Street",5,2018,06,05
249,"Relaxing visit,professional staff,high quality facility","I contacted my Brother Vincent who works at the Clayton hotel Belfast regarding accommodation during our stay in Dublin .We were arriving from New York ,Paul Truscott arranged our accommodation in Clayton Hotel in  Liffey Valley . The hotel was exceptional,with clean rooms and comfortable beds and fantastic service for the price. 
Upon check in Amanda at the front desk was so informative, polite and helpful regarding transportation options and tours. Food was excellent at breakfast and Kevin (staff member)was so friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to those visiting Dublin.Thank You .",5,2018,06,04
249,Fantastic facilities and great service!,"The facilities were great, really pleased with the room - felt more like a flat which was handy considering I was staying for a prolonged period. Made use of the fridge and living room area which had a nice balcony. 

The thing that makes this place was the great service, it was 5 star - In particular Kevin in the restaurant gave great service to everyone, really friendly but what inspired me is his consistency, he showed no signs of letting up as the days/evenings went on, he gave great service to each and everyone including myself, thank you Kevin for your great service. 

Kind Regards
Steven Stickler",5,2018,06,03
249,Great hotel,"We had a night here at the end of a tour, and it was the best hotel by far.  The room was large with a king sized bed plus a fridge which we hadn't had in any of the other hotels we had to stay in.  You could have the window open during the night which is a big bonus for us.  The staff were friendly, the bar and restaurant food was good quality and nice. Just a 15/20 minute taxi ride back to the airport great all round.   ",4,2018,06,03
249,Lovely hotel  great staff ,Stayed here with my family on a treat weekend to Dublin. Very busy hotel but lovely rooms nice beds and very clean. The staff are lovely and the kids club is great was on this time which was a pity. The food is good also which helps ,5,2018,06,03
249,"Outskirts of the city, boring location, no pubs in vicinity, long walk to bus stop.","We had a room on the 4th floor - size was ok, no air-con, no sockets next to bed to charge smart phones etc, single box spring bed-good, safe, kettle, ironing board, small fridge, hangars avail. Breakfast buffet  - good choice, ordering pot of coffee ( weak in taste ) took ages even though we were told to be down for breakfast for 730am , coffee could have been served on the table in a thermos. The waiters were running around like ' blue flies '. Dinner - canteen style  - not 4 star style! We sat at a long table, no table cloth, waiters seemed and looked to be beginners, we had a set menu for dinner! Carrot/coriander soup was good, melon starter - two very small pieces! We had to get up ( canteen style ) for our main course - small portions of fish or chicken, little gravy, veg a bit hard. Dessert - three tiny portions ( not adult size ). Waiter had little knowledge of wines - whether dry or not etc. End of meal waiter brought the total drinks bill/check for 14 persons in stead of asking if we wish to pay as a couple or individually etc - in the end the waiter had to break down the bill - time wasting. Hotel bar - no bar lounge atmosphere, no drinks menu for wine or cocktails etc, no variety of crisps etc. The day we checked out reception staff very helpful with allocating a storage room for our luggage  as we had a late afternoon departure back to FRA. The Dining Room Supervisor was very helpful in helping to sort out a small problem with an unfriendly dining room waitress - he offered us a complimentary bottle of wine with our dinner , I thanked him and explained we had a flight in a couple of hours , he then offered us a round of cappuccino's etc with biscuits, he acted professionally and politely apologised that this had happened.",4,2018,05,28
249,Great staff.. good coffee!,"I don’t often write reviews but my recent experience of the Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley well deserves one. There’s a nice atmosphere at the hotel and I had a very comfortable stay. I ate in the Gusto restaurant and the chef’s signature dish of linguine al frutti di mare was very enjoyable. But what particularly motivated me to post this review was the excellent, friendly staff. I’m a seasoned traveller and staff attitude is always a benchmark for me; here they were all consistently great, very obliging and very efficient, servers and managers alike. And that goes for the front of house staff, too. Plus you can get a great coffee.. five stars!",5,2018,05,26
249,Good standard hotel,"Stayed here rather than closer to town as it was close to the next mornings meetings. Clayton. Good facilities, but it needs to be as there is nothing near by, in terms of eating or drinking.
We ate in and it was OK.
Rooms pretty good, size and comfort, plenty of car parking, gym etc.
Generally Clayton is a good group and I often use the Ballsbridge hotel.",3,2018,05,24
249,Genuine great service,"Perfect location for what I needed for a week long work trip.  Staff very sincere & genuine making you feel welcome. Kevin O’Reilly top notch employee epitomising this 👍 Good local bar near by, as well as Liffey Valley Centre quick walk or drive away. Overall genuine great service 👏👏",5,2018,05,23
249,Nice hotel in a great location,Stayed here over the weekend for the Ed Sheeran and was very happy. Staff were were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were big (we got a complimentary upgrade which was huge - thank you!) and the beds were extremely comfortable. The food was lovely also. Would happily stay again.,4,2018,05,21
249,Happy customer ,Just back from staying at the clayton Hotel have to stay it was well situated to a shopping area unfortunately I didn't get to go to. Staff were great friendly and more than willing to help us. Main bar was clean and again friendly staff and food was good. The room it self was clean big and had everything we needed. Breakfast was good alot of choice plenty of staff to attend to our needs. Would go back for a stay again and would recommend it ,5,2018,05,20
249,Stop Over For A Concert,Delighted to say we stayed here on Friday night. Hotel were extremely accommodating and confirmed us a family room for the evening. We enjoyed a swim in the pool on Friday afternoon before a spot of lunch in the hotel bar. The steak sandwich went down a treat after some bubbly! The room was a great size for 4 adults so would be just as good for a family with kids. Hotel was easy to locate - plenty of parking around it and surprisingly lots to do with a large shopping complex close by. Easily accessible to Dublin City Centre also. Brekkie the next morning was a treat! Lots of tasty food to start the day off well. Would recommend a stay in this hotel for all the reasons above. ,5,2018,05,20
249,Fantastic,"This hotel is absolutely fanastic - the rooms are clean and comfortable, staff extremely friendly and helpful, great facilities (modern gym, ample parking, etc.), varied menus with good quality food, and a great location (so handy to the M50). 

I really can't say enough positive things about this hotel and always recommend to people coming to Dublin. A special mention for everyone on reception, they're a fanastic team and a pleasure to deal wit (Nadine especially, she's a star!)",5,2018,05,20
249,"Some good, some not so good","Stayed here a few nights for business and stayed in a Penthouse suite.

First the good. Location is walking distance to a local shopping mall with food options and a movie theater. Staff was helpful. The breakfast is really good. It has a number of food options both hot and cold. The breakfast restaurant becomes an Italian restaurant at night and while I was skeptical, it was also very good.

The not so good. The penthouse suite is very large and appears it was once very awesome but it hasn’t been maintained well. There are many cracked tiles in the bathroom and stains on the carpet. If this is one of the better rooms I’m worried about the quality of the regular rooms. The hallways smell of cleaning product. The design of the shower is horrible as the only way to turn it on is to spray water all over the bathroom (probably accounts for the non-solid flooring and cracked tiles. There is mold in the shower. Simple caulking would fix this. It was quite warm some of the days and with no AC you are left using a fan to keep cool.

This place is in need of a refresh.",3,2018,05,19
249,Wonderful stay,"We visited here on the first bank holiday of May, staying 2 nights with our 2 little folk in tow. Used it as a base to visit Tayto Park (25 mins away) and Dublin Zoo (15 mins away). We went for a king suite and it was huge and perfect for our family. The kids had their own separate room and own tv and we also had a kitchenette. Ate both nights in Gusto and it was delicious and kid friendly. Breakfast buffet very impressive. We also visited the pool and had a great time. We got the same lady for check in/ out and she was very friendly and professional. Would definitely book again for a family holiday in Dublin.",5,2018,05,18
249,2 adults 3 kids shopping and Zoo weekend,"This was an exceptional weekend of service. We booked in on a Thursday, (the receptionist (Amanda) was really nice and very very helpful.. 10 out of 10.. a duplex room which means that the kids (ages 4, 6 and 9) were in our room but at the same time had their own. The 2 bedroom worked great, the room was clean, had a small eating area to make a sandwich and  had a microwave, kettle and a few basic utensils.
The breakfast was fab, and plenty of it.. Thanks to all the hostessses (to many to name).
The dinner in the evening was really good and very reasonable (€140 inc tip for family with a bottle of red). The manager Kevin is a great guy, exceptional at his job and looked after us really well. The girls in restaurant were always quick to act and knew the menu.. my wife is a vegitarian and nothing was a ""problem"".. i have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone.. I can tell you for sure that we will be back a few more times..",5,2018,05,17
249,Clayton Liffey Valley Top Class.,"My partner Maureen and I can't recommend highly enough Clayton Hotel Liffey Valley. Our stay at Clayton exceeded our expectations. We both travel a lot and this hotel punches well above it's weight. The reception staff are excellent. Most noteworthy for us was Ernestas. This gentleman is an excellent ambassador for all the Clayton has to offer. Ernestas, once aware of our requirements prior to arrival made sure we would not be disappointed. We weren't. We were delighted. Indeed, all the staff were excellent,welcoming and friendly. The accommodation and facilities like pool and spa were amazing. The room was spotless, comfortable,relaxing and excellent value for money. The location of Clayton Liffey Valley is ideal for an employable relaxing stay. We felt safe, looked after and well fed. As in past stays at former Clarion, we now both unreservedly recommend Clayton Liffey Valley, to all visitors, as a Top Class accommodation. It's well worth a revisit and that we certainly shall. Again. Well done Ernestas and the wonderful staff/management of Clayton Liffey Valley. Thank you all. Much Appreciated. John&Maureen.",5,2018,05,17
249,Poor customer service,"Stayed there for one night recently and it left a bitter taste. 
Prior to the night in question we requested to change the date, this could be done though that was not the problem. The problem was the customer service over the phone. First we were told there was no booking, even though it had been paid for, and then we were made contact them (on the day of the booking) to see if it was still there or not. They finally recitified this and we were able to travel, though did not receive even an apology, just an attitude. 
Then upon arrival we were then told there was no booking and upon our insistence they investigated and realized there was, again with no apologies. After the night in question upon checkout we were publically called back and shamed (if you will) for a due balance- which had been paid upon arrival. Upon insistence again they investigated and realized it had been paid. Again no apologies received in any form. Overall bad experience, with hotel staff who lack any training or desire to be there.",1,2018,05,12
249,"Very clean, comfy beds, nice rooms, let down by customer service","We arrived at nearly midnight after a long journey to find that although we had requested a twin room, a miscommunication from the booking agent meant that we were assigned a double room. Although it was quite clearly neither our fault nor the fault of the hotel the receptionist made an enormous effort to deflect blame and no effort whatsoever to find a workable solution to the issue. At this point another member of staff stepped in and offered to arrange a fold out bed to be placed in the double room for the night, gave us complementary breakfast for the morning, and suggested that we ask at the desk in the morning to be moved to a twin room when one would be available. Why he couldn't have just booked us into a twin room from the next day onward then and there I have no idea, neither do I know why we were only offered complimentary breakfast for one morning instead of the rest of our stay, but we accepted this as we were tired and, after the way we were spoken to by the first receptionist, really rather frustrated. This was by no means helped by the first receptionist insisting that we smile for him on our way to the room, which was wildly inappropriate and downright unacceptable behaviour, aside from being the last thing that was going to make us actually smile. Luckily we had no more interactions with him during our stay.
The other staff we encountered were much more pleasant however, were unable to provide any information about the airport hopper service that stopped within clear view of the reception desk twice an hour. They were unable to book us onto the service when the website wouldn't work and were unable to tell us what times the bus arrived at the hotel even though they could clearly see it every time it arrived and there was a timetable within view of the desk also.
We ordered room service once during our stay which was extortionate considering the underside of the tray was covered in chocolate sauce which was then transferred to the white bed linen upon being set down.
The hotel was actually one of the nicest I have stayed in, and were it not for the customer service it would have got a 5 star rating as the entire hotel was spotless with lovely rooms and comfy beds, but we were most certainly unimpressed with the staff, and having worked in customer service I feel they did the absolute bare minimum.",3,2018,05,12
249,Perfect location for Liffey Valley,"It was our second visit here, having visited five years ago (to the day!) when it was the Clarion. 

The rooms are adequate for a night or two, clean and tidy. It’s a great location for the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, which is only a ten minute walk away.

The staff were so helpful. Every member of staff I spoke to was courteous and it felt like they wanted to be there - something not often found in hotels like this. ",4,2018,05,12
249,Fantastic,"We have just returned from a 1 night stay here. The entire hotel is spotless and smells so fresh. 
There is a large selection of food and a lovely bar.

249,Perfect venue for business seminar,"This hotel is very well situated, great facilities for small or large meetings/seminars and the staff were very welcoming & attentive. 
I was in a very large group, so the lunch queue was long, but it was very well managed and moved quite quickly. The food was piping hot, very nicely cooked and served with a smile. 
Would be very happy to recommend this hotel for business groups.

249,"Brief trip, wished I'd stayed longer","I visited here in Sept of 2017, the room was great and comfortable, Leonela in the restaurant was very helpful and courteous. I had booked also booked a few days at the Green Isle at the end of my trip. They could  learn a thing or two from the Clarion",4,2018,05,09
249,Great atomsphere ,Love this hotel ... food is top notch... great atmosphere in the hotel night nor day.. all staff sre very friendly .. me and herself have stayed here 3/4 times rooms are big and very clean comfortable ... one person that is a credit is paul the barman ... he is a credit to the hotel very welcoming great personaity and very hard worker the man needs a payrise !! Breakfast very good food is lovely never a fault and also liffey valley right across the road .. we will be back,5,2018,05,06
249,Good friendly hotel,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at the hotel on the 25th April - 30th April. We were travelling for a wedding and our first holiday together. First of all all of the staff were incredibly friendly and really did assist with anything we asked for. 
The gym was a little bit haphazard and a lot of the weights were not matching and the equipment wasn't brilliant, however for me *cardio bunny* it was acceptable. The swimming pool, sauna and steam room are amazing! Family friendly and very clean, yes you need a swim cap but I think that makes it just seem more hygienic and well looked after. The staff were very helpful especially with my gluten allergy. Furthermore, it is a very big hotel and one can get lost so be mindful of your room! The room service finishes at 10 - there is a wonderful shopping centre just down the road with a Vue cinema and many restaurants which me and my boyfriend used throughout our stay. Do not get on the no. 40 bus into town! It takes forever - instead walk towards the motorway near the shopping centre and use the bridge for the overpass and get the 25,66,67,25a,25b into town! Only 25-30 mins. Very close to the town centre and the wonderful zoo! Very worth a visit and made our trip amazing 😊 
Overall was a good hotel, with yummy food and a good customer service 3.5/5",3,2018,05,01
249,Ok stay,Some of the staff did not seem happy which does not put you at ease when staying at a property. The bartender was downright rude to my brother and husband. The “hydration station” at check in had loads of cups available but not a drop of water to be found. What’s the point in having a “hydration station” if you’re not going to supply water?!?! The coffee bar area to the left of the check in desk was left dirty around 11 pm at night. Coffee grounds were all over the place and some sort of wooden plates left hap-hazardley underneath the bar. The wooden plates/ serving boards looked dirty and were just left there after sitting just under the bar. I noticed this while I was sitting there waiting for my husband. We did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel and wouldn’t feel confident doing so after seeing the state of the bar/restaurant area after hours. The rooms were clean and what you would expect. Comfy beds and pillows.,3,2018,04,29
249,Good Hotel,"Nice hotel with great staff. Check in was easy. All the girls at the reception desk were fantastic, friendly and helpful and a special  mention for Nadine who really went out of her way to help us out with a personal matter we needed to attend to urgently. The room was great and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and room was very clean. The reception staff where the best staff we encountered during our 5 weeks of travelling around Ireland and Northern Europe.",5,2018,04,27
249,Only ok,"Check in is great and fast staff very friendly looks.like a nice hotel but if say it more for.business than pleasure by the clientele. 
Rooms are in need of up dating we booked a family room and got a standard double room with and extra single bed shoved in to make the room more cramped. Not.much space for a family of 4 especially a young family.
Food only ok went to bar for food to be told they don't serve dinner until 6 pm.and they have a menu on table which was a lunch menu with sambos and bits on not very impressive making a lot  it says on the menu lunch until 4.30 on website it has 2 different menus to what's on display .. very disappointed..got pizza for our 4 year old and it was so hard and over cooked little or no cheese or sauce. Very rude bar staff no one seemed friendly and managers speaking among themselves in there own language !. Back rooms over look main road and are very noisy maybe sound proofing should be looked into ",3,2018,04,25
249,Very nice staff - lovely room,"I have just returned from a weekend there (April 2018). The staff are lovely and helpful.
They sorted out all my special dietary requirements. The rooms are lovely, spacious, well appointed with nice bathrooms. You can get there in 15 minutes on the Airport Hopper (cheaper to buy fares online). And .... it is right next to a big shopping centre. Lovely",5,2018,04,23
249,Shortest ever,Called on a Sunday evening..730 pm.. pre cinema to have a drink.apparently not....only residents bar...not impressed ...nor did the bland anodyne bleating about hotel policy impress....and maybe it was policy toi not to direct us across the car park to the Elms bar,1,2018,04,22
249,Limited Time Meeting Room,"Our meeting went well and the Clayton service and meeting room greatly helped. I am delighted that it’s possible to get a meeting room for a short 1 or 2 hour period at a reasonable cost and this will encourage us to use it more often. Check in, the in room service (really good, nice guy that was very helpful) and then your follow up was all of the highest standard.

Good experience and we’ll be back.",4,2018,04,13
249,Clayton Stay - Business but would not stay for more than one or two nights,"The front desk staff were friendly, but they had constant issues with the key card cutting machine.  Over the three days I stayed here I saw an almost constant flow of people at the front desk getting keys re-cut.

The breakfast was lovely, the pool facilities very good.  The gym unfortunately has a lot of broken equipment, and weights need replacing / updating.

The room quality is beginning to look a bit aged, specifically the beds are probably due the upgrade!

The hotspot system in the hotel is old and antiquated.  Its looking for logon details which can easily be falsified.  There are many new hotspot systems that are much more seemless and work with all devices.  I tested with Apple, Android and Windows and only Windows worked ok.  Android and Apple had issues, which were intermittent, with the popup hotspot pages.  Suggest review of this.  The internet speed itself was perfect, and great quality once you got past the hotspot system.

The last comment is that I stayed in three different rooms at this hotel (on this stay and one previous).  Every time I come here I find the place to be quite noisy.  There do not seem to be rooms where you can get some quiet time.

Here is a nice simple one...   put some bottled water in the rooms for your guests....

Hope this is taken as positive feedback.  Not trying to lambast anyone here.  I am certain that this hotel will improve with the new ownership.

:)",3,2018,04,11
249,"No sleep, very loud hotel, unhelpful staff.","I'll start with the positives. 
Breakfast was good, rooms nice and clean and the executive rooms are good size for families with kids. 

Negatives
The pull out bed for a child was impossible to sleep on it was very uncomfortable. 
We got no sleep at all. There is no sound proofing at all I could hear every word of every conversation in the next room. Any time a door on the corridor closed the walls shook. We had someone knocking on our door at 3.45am. There was obviously people leaving about 5am and pulling their suitcases along the corridor it sounded like a rally. No soundproofing on the windows could hear all the traffic noise from the road.

There was no latch on the door so when my daughter mistook the room door for the bathroom door in the middle of the night she went out of the room and into the corridor. She would have been locked out only that we weren't asleep due the aforementioned noise levels. 

Parking was expensive but then it is Dublin. 

When I made this booking because of the family room I made another booking for a few weeks time. My account has been debited for that booking but I got no email confirmation so I asked the hotel about this and they have no record of the reservation. I am getting absolutely no where with the staff as to why my account was debited. 
Bad bad bad customer service. Don't use the website, don't use click on Clayton there are issues with the booking service. 

It's a good way out of town we parked in the shopping centre and got the bus into town. 

I thought I was getting a good deal but it was cheaper for a reason. If you are a heavy sleeper or can bring ear plugs and sleeping pills that is the only way you'll get any sleep here.",1,2018,04,08
249,"Very well looked after, staff excellent","We had an excellent experience in Clayton Liffey Valley recently. Room was large, quiet spacious and comfortable. Staff were most helpful and efficient. Breakfast was very good and there was a great selection. I couldn't fault anything at all and look forward to returning.",5,2018,04,05
249,Excellent Stay,"We stayed here from 29.03.18 until 02.04.18 & can say without any doubt, we had a fabulous experience. From check in to check out, nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were great, clean & comfortable. Restaurants excellent, lovely food. Staff were outstanding, friendly, helpful, polite. We will definitely be returning. Thanks everyone at Clayton Hotel, Liffey Valley, Dublin.",5,2018,04,02
249,Good hotel and good price for Dublin ,We stayed here for the Easter break. Cheapest hotel we got as it was a last minute deal. Right next door to liffey valley shopping centre. Breakfast buffet style with lots of choice and delicious. Rooms are lovely warm and clear. This hotel is ideal for families going to zoo or tayto park. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Parking yes is 6euro per day but for Dublin that's a steal. Would definitely stay here again a great find. Great bar and restaurant across the road called Murphy's inn. ,5,2018,04,02
249,Great Dublin hotel,"Was pleasantly surprised by the peace and quiet in the lower floor rooms in this hotel. Everything was spotless , beds comfortable and the breakfast was great. The leisure facilities were very good . Will definitely return.",5,2018,04,02
249,Easter break,"The only reason I booked this hotel was down to the price. The lady at check in was very courteous and gave plenty of information about the hotel. The room is quite out dated. This hotel has spent most of their money upgrading the public areas and restaurant. The rooms need a massive refurbishment. Maybe they’ve already begun this and I just got unlucky. Car park is underground and costs €6 for 3-24 hours. If you drive in just to drop your luggage to your room and freshen up and can do all of that within 3 hours then parking is free. Overall it’s a comfy stay, walls are quite thin - I clearly heard a full blown conversation and the guy sneezing sounded like he was next to me. I was on the second floor in a twin room. It’s a grand hotel, but there’s better out there for good prices. ",3,2018,04,01
249,"Second review of this hotel - Overpriced, bad service","Seems to me that since my previous review service has gone down hill. 
Prices have increased substantially and not justified. Unfortunately there is an error with reservations every time I check in. 
It is certainly a good location if you are looking for shopping - close to Liffey Valley shopping centre. Not great if you are looking to see Dublin city - quite far out so you'd be better off staying close to town. 
Hotel is clean.
If you are looking for a quiet nights sleep - I suggest that you request a room away from the roads as it is very loud. Also if you are there for business / with your partner, there are a lot of families staying in the hotel meaning the noise levels are increased in the corridors and bedrooms.",3,2018,03,27
249,So helpful and accommodating at a difficult time for my family,"We stay at the Clayton Hotel (formerly Clarion) for our annual trip home to Ireland.  We chose it because of its proximity to M4/Dublin, price and great buffet breakfast.  Normally we stay in the serviced apartments because of the space/size and ability to entertain as well as ""live"" there (cook/eat etc).

This year my Mother and Sister flew urgently to Ireland for a dying relative.  There were limited rooms available and I send a pleading email.  Within on hour, I was contacted by Leione, a Director at the hotel who was so helpful and understanding.  She was able to find the room I needed and on the two days that the hotel was totally booked (St Paddy's Day weekend) she went above and beyond to find room at an affiliated hotel in Dublin.

Unfortunately my Mother got sick while there and once again the Clayton Hotel staff were there for my mother arranging the hotels on-call Dr to visit my mother in the room.  Hotel employees even called the next day to see how my mother was doing.  My mother go more sick and needed an ambulance - again clayton hotel called ambulance and brought them to the room.

Hotel staff asked my sister everyday about my mother and wanted to know if they could do anything to help.  Mum and Sis had payed for breakfast in advance and the staff who knew my mum liked the paper set aside a newspaper and some food in a care package for my sister to take to the hospital.  Extending the room for my sister on a day by day basis...Mum got discharged and flew home to Canada - well again :)

I cannot express how grateful I am for the outstanding service and compassion shown my family at a difficult time.  We were worried about the hotel changing ownership but I must say without hesitation that the Clayton Hotel staff and their entire team GREATLY EXCEEDED our expectations and were so caring and helpful to my family at a difficult time.  THANK YOU CLAYTON HOTEL",5,2018,03,26
249,You stay for the people,"For the best part of a year I've been staying at the Clayton (previously Clarion) hotel in Liffey Valley. Now as I enter my final week I feel I should provide a review of my time. 

As you'll see from the range of other reviews on this site the Clayton is a large hotel and as such there is always something going on. With that in mind it's always possible to have a disappointing experience. That said, having stayed on most floors and in most of the room types  I can honestly say that any negative experiences are by exception an definitely not the rule. 

Compensating for any problems are the staff, who go out of their way to try and resolve whichever issues you might have. From the team on reception (who are always willing to try and be flexible) to the management again always readily available the desire to help is clear. The breakfast team (led by the wonderful Sharon & Ivo) face a constant whirl of customers and remain bright and cheerful throughout, which from 6:30am is an art in itself. 

The gym is fantastic, whereas other hotels claim to have gyms (which turn out to be converted bedrooms with a few machines in them), the Clayton has a genuine leisure suite with a large gym, swimming pool, spinning, exercise classes, etc. The atmosphere is relaxed with all kinds of body shapes and ages present. You're just left to get on and exercise at your own pace.  

I will be genuinely sad to say goodbye when I depart this week, which is probably the greatest compliment that I can give.",5,2018,03,26
249,Business Meeting,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night. Room was excellent with a very comfortable bed. The restaurant and bar are welcoming and the food is of a very high standard in both. The staff are welcoming ,friendly and efficient. Although the hotel is a little outside of the city there is the Liffey Valley Shopping Mall within 5 minutes walk which has a great selection of shops, restaurants and a cinema. That said the hotel is easily reached by motorway and the city is a short drive away. there is also an airport shuttle bus to the airport.
I also booked a meeting room for a training exercise and the staff could not have been more helpful, assisting me in setting up the lap top, screen and taking orders for lunch etc Their attention to detail made everything run very smoothly and the room itself and associated equipment was state of the art.
The hotel has a leisure facility, with pool, sauna and steam room. I saw the facility being thoroughly cleaned early in the morning and later used the staem room and pool. The showering area is a little tired but clean and functional and the changing rooms are spacious with ample lockers etc.
I had stayed here previously and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for either business or leisure.",5,2018,03,22
249,Coffee in the Morning,"If you are planning in staying in the Clayton, at breakfast I would highly recommend getting your coffee from the Barista Leo, this is much much better than the coffee/tea offered with the usual breakfast. The coffee is great and so is Leo himself. The best way to start the day. ",5,2018,03,22
249,Family break,"We spent two nights recently at this hotel and it was very enjoyable! My daughter and my three grandaughters had a family room with a separate bedroom and kitchenette which was very comfortable, lovely breakfasts and very close to shopping! Would recommend it for a family break also kids pool and play area was fab! We will be back!",5,2018,03,21
249,Excellent ,"I am happy to give this hotel 5 stars. The service was excellent, the staff were so friendly and helpful; Payal, you were a star, accommodating our changed plans. Very relaxed atmosphere. The rooms were immaculate and the food was really good too. Just can’t find anything to complain about! Would highly recommend it. ❤️",5,2018,03,16
249,Very bad Lunch ,"Work near by & needed to catch a quick lunch , got table in bar , waited 10 mins to have order taken . 
Choose veg soup together with tuna sandwich,  no butter. 
Both arrived 5 mins later . Soup was tasteless served with a slice of stale brown bread ! Sandwich was delivered with butter . Send sandwich back & swiftly got replacement with less butter ! To busy to wait so just ate food , paid & left . Service here is the worst I have experienced . Will not return  

 ",2,2018,03,12
249,Two night stay!,"We stayed for two nights and found the hotel a nice clean & friendly place to stay, ideal for a walk over to Liffey Valley shopping centre and just off the M50 motorway so ideal location for the airport among other amenities. The breakfast is buffet style but very hot and a good selection to choose from also. the only gripe I would have with the hotel is charging paying guests €6 a day for parking which I can see other reviewers have also mentioned also, rooms are very spacious and clean and good selection of channels on TV also, enjoyed this hotel and would stay again!",5,2018,03,12
249,Fantastic facilities,"Myself and my husband stayed for one night at the hotel. 
Rooms are really lovely with very comfortable beds, plenty of storage space, good TV channels, ironing board with iron, safe, proper fullsized hairdryer and tea\ coffee facilities.
Staff were extremely friendly and could not do enough for us. 
It has a lovely pool, sauna, steamroom and Jacuzzi (also a gym which we did not use). Towels were provided. 
Location wise there are plenty of restaurants. We ate at the Arc bar which was delicious and good value. Breakfast at the hotel was also delicious with a really good selection of hot and cold food.
There is an extremely good shopping mall about 5-10 minutes walk away. Here you can also get the number 40 bus to the city center ( journey takes about a hour and costs €3.30 for an adult). There is a quicker bus if you walk past the shopping mall (marks and Spencer entrance) and use the pedestrian bridge to cross the main road. All buses here go into the city center.
The airport hopper bus goes directly from the airport to the Clayton hotel and costs €10-12 adult single, €18-20 return. 
If you do not mind being so far from the city this hotel is an absolute gem!",4,2018,03,12
249,Exorbitant parking rates,"After using one of the conference rooms here for a meeting my colleagues and I brought our parking tickets to the reception for validation as would be the norm in most hotels. To be told that we must validate our tickets in the blue pay machine for €6 each. May not seem a huge amount, but multiply that by the number of unsuspecting patrons who may use their facilities every day and it amounts to an exorbitant practice.",2,2018,03,10
249,"Long stay, made better by staff","I have been here for over two months for work. 
The staff, Sharon (breakfast shift), Ivo (EEvo), Natalie and Kevin (in the bar) stood out as genuinely being happy to see me even during the snow in for days (storm Emma and the Beast from the East).

My hats off to all the staff (management included) for the service during the snow in.

It has been like a reoccurring episode from cheers, very much like home (away from home)
The hotel is dated but clean.....the staff is what makes the stay memorable and I will remember this trip for a long time because of that. 

Easy walk to bus into Dublin or to Liffey valley mall.
Stayed in the apartments.",4,2018,03,09
249,Angels,"Thank you very much to all the team. To Paul, Sibella, Simon, Craig, Kevin. We felt safe there during the big storm. They looked aftter us like family in a very hard times.
The hotel is fantastic, amazing rooms, very nice dinner and spectacular breakfast.
Thank you all, we’ll be back.",5,2018,03,06
249,Buried by 'the Beast from the East' (Storm Emma),The staff at the hotel made this trip fantastic for what was looking to be a disastrous weekend at the onset with a very real likelihood of a wedding being cancelled.  We arrived a day early and booking the extra night was no problem. We arrived at 1am in the height of the snow blizzard known as 'the Beast from the East' to the point that the roads leading to the hotel couldn't be seen at all.  There followed a national red alert the next day and everyone was stuck.  For 5 days most of the staff stayed on site and cooked/served/waited on us with smiles and professionalism throughout.  The decision to go to buffet food was a great idea and the drinks didn't run out keeping everyone happy.  Great forward planning by the management and super team spirit by all the staff.  The hotel has a pool & sauna/spa which is small but very welcome and a gym meaning our running training could continue!  The car park was ploughed eventually and staff happily helped push cars when needed.,5,2018,03,06
249,Pleasant enough,"Does what it says on the tin - reasonably priced, clean rooms, with functioning showers. By request we were given a quiet room on the ground floor - apparently at weekends there are often children around who aren't necessarily quiet.
We stayed 3 nights. Bed comfortable but sheets not straightened when made - just covered!",3,2018,03,03
249,Pleasant,I stayed here for business for a week in January. It is a busy hotel with lots of people about and lots happening. Always a bit of a buzz around the foyer/lobby. The room was nice and the restaurant offered a decent variety of food. Liffy valley centre is only a short walk if you fancy eating somewhere else.  There is complementary access to the leisure centre attached to the hotel for guests which was good to use in the evenings.,4,2018,03,01
249,"Wonderful Stay, Great Location, Friendly Staff","Stayed here recently with friends for the purpose of exploring the sights and wonders of Dublin. Great base hotel to use as it is only a ten minute taxi to Dublin City centre! Staff were friendly from the receptionist at check in, to the duty manager, to the senior management. Paul was exceptional helpful and provided my fiends and I with a show-round of the hotel and the facilities they could offer. He explained the exciting future the hotel has ahead and I will definitely be back to see this! Breakfast was lovely, with a great choice of continental and full Irish. Well done team Clayton, you’ve done it again! And as you say .... your stay your way!! ",5,2018,02,24
249,Never again!!,"My son booked this hotel for himself and me. He was meeting up with friends and so was I. We arrived to find that there were no parking spaces on the ground floor carpark or anywhere near to the hotel. I dropped my son off and asked him to book in and I would follow as I was late to meet my friend. Staff refused to allow him as he was 17 years old. When I abandoned my car, the reception staff asked if my son was staying alone which I said No and I informed them I was staying. Quickly, over the receptionist shoulder another stout women appeared asking me was I sure as my son was under 18! Then she quickly disappeared to a room behind the reception and a man with glasses appeared asking me was I sure. I said yes. Totally humiliating!!
I had intended to visit my friend and leave my car at her home and taxi back to the hotel but was forced to pay the extra 6euros for underground parking which was FULL to capacity!! I had to wait until a car left to find a space.
The worst was that when I cancelled my visit with my friend as I was made feel I had to stay in the hotel the room phone rang from reception and when I answered and they heard my voice they hung up - clearly verifying my stay.
I was so disgusted with the way the staff treated me - I felt I had stolen from them even when I had paid in advance for the stay, that when my son was due to come back to the hotel I collected him and drove all night home - didn't stay or have breakfast I paid for!!
Avoid unless you like playing foolish games and totally feeling worthless!!",1,2018,02,23
249,Excellent conference facilities,"Having used the Clayton Hotel yesterday for the delivery of a training programme, we were impressed with the standard of meeting room facilities and, in particular, the professional support provided  (thank you Helena!).",5,2018,02,21
249,Weekend Away,We stayed at this hotel for two nights.  Nice hotel the room was lovely a big thank you to Brigetta at reception who was very welcoming and very helpful. The staff really make this hotel for me.  All the staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very close to Liffey Valley shopping centre.  We got the no 40 bus from Liffey valley to the city centre which is very convenient. Nice swimming pool also.,5,2018,02,18
249,Italian restaurant staff ,"Our stay was amazing, we went to the restaurant gusto that’s located in the hotel, one of the girls who works there Amanda was nothing but helpful such a polite girl, made our flow easy , we would definitely stay here again and attend the restaurant ",5,2018,02,16
249,Great venue for meetings,"This is our third time to use this venue for our meetings and interviews. Conference staff were extremely helpful, and the room was presented very professionally, with all of the necessary equipment available.",5,2018,02,16
249,OUR STAY IN THE CLAYTON HOTEL LIFFEY VALLEY.,"Having just ended my stay here at the Clayton Liffey Valley ,I can say it really is an excellent place to stay with great overall service which includes Sharon in the breakfast area who looked after my wife and myself every morning throughout our stay always with a smile and excellent service as both of us are disable despite the large numbers staying at the hotel we were well looked after. So easy to see why the hotel is so popular for business and family stays",4,2018,02,16
249,Great staff,"Never thought we would find Kudos bar in the Clayton Hotel to be our go to, but it is. If you are from Lucan area and looking for a change try it.  Food so far has been fantastic,great with the kids and the staff are so obliging especially Kevin,Ina and Nathalie,always make the kids feel special. Stephen makes one mean pizza defo worth a try!",5,2018,02,12
249,Soul destroying hotel. ,"Grey Hotel, horrible setting, very long walk from reception to room. Room itself was clean and cheerful. The bar was completely without atmosphere. Good value if you just want somewhere to put your head down near Dublin. ",2,2018,02,10
249,Lunch ,Visited the hotel today for a business lunch and delighted with the quality of service. I was served by Sharon (blonde lady) who couldn't of done any more for us. Food was amazing. We were then greeted by Jamie who was very friends and helpful. A+++ will have to revisit soon,5,2018,02,07
249,"Great, friendly service at lunch-time today.",Many thanks to Sharon for looking after us so well today. We were a group of 5 attending a conference upstairs. Sharon went out of her way to seat us in a quiet area and made sure we were well looked-after. Thanks a million.,5,2018,02,06
249,Lunch before Seminar,"I had lunch prior to attending the seminar. Our waitress Sharon was very professional, friendly and helpful. We were a group of five and she opened up a section of the restaurant so we would sit together. I had soup and a sandwich both of which were really tasty and fresh. ",5,2018,02,06
249,Great Hotel,"Stopped here for 2 nights with my teenage son on way to/ from athletics comp in Athlone - brilliant point to stop with motorway links to everywhere easily. Easy commute to the city centre also. 
Great facilities .... pool, sauna etc, which is hard to come by in Dublin, combined with fab food and a clean spacious room. 
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff throughout  - nothing too much trouble - special mention to one of the managers Paul, and Glen in the bar for all your help and advice. 
Thanks to all - will definitely be back. ",5,2018,02,05
249,Brilliant Hotel !!,"We had an amazing trip this past weekend!  The hotel staff, in particular Paul Truscott, were all very helpful and friendly from we checked in until check out.  The rooms are great and the food is lovely in the bar lounge area.  It’s great to have the swimming pool and would highly recommend this hotel ! ",5,2018,02,05
249,Only Average.,"Stayed Feb 2018 in a family room. Not great really to be honest, and I wouldn't be the hardest person to please.  Kids were bored.   It says on their web site that there is a movie room.....There isn't, We even spoke to the manager about this and he denied its saying this on the web site.   Click on the family section.....It says ""Movie Room"" !!!
Swimming pool was okay,  Kids weren't allowed jump in, yet the photos on their web page clearly shows kids jumping in enjoying themselves. !!!
Parking is charged at 6 Euro per night.......Really!!!!!........I'm staying in your hotel, It's not prime city center location....Parking should be free for patrons.

Check out the web site before thinking about staying here, and phone the hotel to find out if the activities they say they deliver, make sure that they actually supply. 

Conclusion:  Wouldn't stay here again. - Sorry.",3,2018,02,04
249,Clayton or Childcare? ,"One word, appalling. I haven’t even finished my stay here as of yet but I cannot wait to. The standard of customer service is absolutely shocking!   

Firstly, I arrived to the hotel on Friday night with my mum for a weekend stay.I got to the customer service desk and I was notified about a 50 euro deposit that must be paid on arrival and will be given back after you leave, I was never notified about this when booking however i didn’t mind much, just not exactly ideal for people who may not have the extra cash at hand. Secondly, there was an overnight charge for parking that we were never notified about,unlike most hotels. Again, this didn’t bother me much and so I didn’t mind. We got to our room and there must have been a huge shortage on the tea and coffee supply, there were 2 teabags and not a sachet of milk in sight.However this is something reception did fix.

The beginning of the real problem started that night, the walls of these hotel rooms are thin as paper. I could hear everything even with the TV on high volume, I could hear a whole conversation from the room next to me and especially from the corridors. I let it go and done no complaining to reception, apart from tonight. There has been and there still is groups of children running up and down the corridor outside our room banging on doors and screaming. I understand children play etc and that’s why I rang reception and asked if they could ask the children to kindly stay quiet,they agreed and said they’d send a manager upstairs. However that was an hour ago and clearly nothing has been done as I still have children banging on the door as I try to sleep.

To top it off there’s a poor gluten free breakfast section and the hotel keys work when they want. In my opinion, you’d be better off in a hostel.

249,Amazing stay ,Stayed here with a colleague in January.  From check in to check out we were really looked after.  The food in the restaurant is excellent.  The bar staff couldn't have been friendlier.  The breakfast was great and Paul the Manager came and chatted to us and really made us feel welcomed.  This stay was amazing and I've booked here for my next 6 trips ,5,2018,02,01
249,Excellent Family Hotel,"Great family hotel . Have stayed an number of times with  my family and have always found it to be a excellent hotel in terms of facilities and accommodation 

The staff are very helpful and the rooms are very clean and tidy",5,2018,01,29
249,Unbelievable service ,"I have stayed a few times in this hotel in the last year. It is without a doubt one of the best hotels in dublin. The staff go above and beyond to insure you have a wonderful stay. It has an absolutely ideal location. Directly across from one of the biggest shopping centres in dublin. Airport shuttle service. 10mins to heuston station. Buses into centre every tens mins ; only a few mins walk from hotel. Excellent food ,luxurious rooms.",5,2018,01,28
249,Second time visting and will be back again,"We stayed here on the night of the 20th January 2018.. Two adults and two children.  Room was great perfect size. Beds very comfy.  We had to leave before 7am on Sunday morning and we were given a choice of a boxed breakfast or a continental one.  We chose the continental and was perfect.  Liffey Valley is within walking distance.
Very easy to find.  Free parking.  Will be staying here again. 
Only con was only 2 mugs in room.  Only 2 towels.  Even though there was four of us in the room.  Now the cleaning staff were great and very quickly delivered the requested items but I think reception might ask if you require extra towels etc.  Four people were booked into the room so should have amenities for four.",4,2018,01,25
249,Adapted room,"Fantastic hotel for wheelchair users. Our room was huge, hubby has a large electric wheelchair and he managed to move around no problem. The wet room was easily accessible,  hand rails at appropriate places, large low wash hand basin and great shower area although the fold down shower seat was very small.  Plenty of hanging space and drawers too. We noticed how clean everything was too, I'm a fanatical about cleanliness but slept easy!! 
Good food and brilliant friendly smiley staff. It was lovely to go down to breakfast and be met and served by Sharan  nothing was too much trouble and she was so welcoming it was a great start to the day.",5,2018,01,24
249,"Nice hotel
Bar is poor","Nice warm room it was very clean 
Shower was powerful
Bathroom was very clean
Reception staff were great 

Bar was poor and had temple bar prices
Some staff were rude in the bar also
I’d stay again for a night",3,2018,01,23
249,"Interconnected doors on both sides of room; very noisy, food poor","The room itself was very small - it had interconnecting doors on both sides of the room.  Walls are paper thin; all television programming could be heard even though on low volume.  I was spending night in hotel as working in area during weekend and too tired to travel back North afterwards; and husband had joined me. 
Very hard to sleep in. 
Only had breakfast in the hotel; everything for some reason smelled and tasted as though had been cooked in vinegar.  Very poor service at breakfast and on check-in; almost have to go and track staff.  That was on both mornings. 
Very hectic hotel overran by large families - particularly next morning.",3,2018,01,22
249,"Good hotel, poorly managed","The Clayton Hotel is a nice hotel but I get the impression it's not very well managed. Despite requesting a travel cot at booking, emailing them to make sure there would be a cot a few days before we arrived (and getting an email confirming there would be a cot) there was no cot in our room. Four beds but no cot. The cot didn't arrive for another half an hour after I called down to reception. My son is 18 months old, he can't sleep in a bed.

The carpets in some of the hallways needed a good hoover and I saw front-of-house staff doing this, while housekeeping was still working over the rooms at around half four in the afternoon.

Despite having not taken our rubbish that day.

We did what most other guests were doing and left it outside our room. Which didn't help the look of the hotel. 

The hotel is not accessible unless you drive to be honest and the food was stupidly expensive so I don't know if it was any good because we didn't go to their restaurant.

The beds were comfy and the room was warm (once we turned the radiator down) and it was the best value option in terms of actual money I paid for the nights I stayed. 

I doubt I will be staying with them again to be honest. Nice but not great.",3,2018,01,20
249,Favourite hotel for meeting people,"My husband Declan is self employed and meets people in various lobbies/bars in hotels around Dublin. This is his review! 
 The Clayton is my favourite Dublin Hotel for meeting people including all the city centre hotels.  The 'two Sharon's' are excellent team players and are fantastic workers. I never have to wait for a coffee or my bowl of soup and the girls are exceptionally friendly and efficient.  The food is excellent, the hotel is spotless and the service I receive is second to none. Keep up the good work as I have no hesitation recommending this hotel to my country friends when they stay in Dublin.",5,2018,01,16
249,Value for money ,"1 family night out 2 adults and 2 kids. Nice hotel, well located. Close to City, 15 mins from the Zoo. Few mins walk from shopping centre, which has a large selection of restaurants, a cinema and a good selection of shops which close around 6. Breakfast was good in a comfortable restaurant, plenty of choices. Room was a double room with 2 extra single beds fitted in. Not much room to move around but as we were only there ford one night it was fine. Pool was good sized. Main pool was deep but there is a nice kids pool if they are under 5 or 6. We would go back again as the rate for B&B was very good for 4 of us for 1 night.",4,2018,01,16
249,"Excellent stay, highly recommend! ","Extremely friendly service! Our room was so clean and very well presented. Breakfast buffet is great, we ate at 9.30 (half an hour before close) and the food was very fresh. The staff are lovely. Highly recommend. ",5,2018,01,12
249,Excellent stay!,"I stayed with the Clayton Liffey valley just before Christmas it was brilliant, we booked direct with the hotel a very kind lady abbie from the reservations gave me such a generous price for me and my husband with breakfast.she was so nice she made us excited for our stay. We were checked in by another kind welcoming staff member Niamh and she gave us a complimentary upgrade. Our room was more than amazing , we ate in the Gusto restaurant and it was quick and food was exceptional and great location.only down fall would be the staff in gusto were not very friendly but we will not let it stop us from booking again. We hope to book again this year",4,2018,01,11
249,Overnight stay,"Stayed one night with family when visiting Zoo.
We arrived two hours early before check in time but was no problem rooms weren't ready but we were able to use the pool until rooms ready.  The pool was excellent and was thoroughly enjoyed by our 2 year old grandson and even more so by his mum and dad.
The rooms were very clean comfortable and great size.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked good and it was quite busy.
The hotel was very busy and We had never experienced so many kids in a hotel so many families but despite this it caused us no problems whatsoeve.
We had a lovely breakfast next morning then back in the pool for an hour before checking out and heading home.
It was a very enjoyable short break and we would certainly stay again in the future.",5,2018,01,10
249,Slight changes needed to make this a great place,"Just had an overnight stay here. It was a Christmas gift. The room was lovely and  spacious.  We decided to have dinner in the Gusto restaurant situated in the hotel. We ordered a childs portion of spaghetti Bolognese, a calzone, and a main portion of prawns in garlic sauce. The calzone and pasta were of great quality and a good size portion. However the prawn dish consisted of 4 prawns and some baked zucchini which we thought was expensive at 18 euro. We had to order a side dish at 4euro to bulk the dinner order. I was also surprised to be charged 6euro for parking when checking out. As residents i would have expected free parking? 
",3,2018,01,08
249,Was warned the standard of service at this place was poor!,"Booked in for 3 nights (and now regrettably I also have another 4 nights next week to follow)
Colleagues warned me this place is like faulty towers and tonight I find they are right.
Arrived back in room at 1750 to find no milk to have with a coffee. Rang reception and was told some would be sent to my room......strange I thought it might be fairly immediate but after waiting some time, then gone for dinner and returned nearly 3 hrs later I find nothing, absolutely nothing has been left.
So I then try reception again......no reply, I try room service, no response, I try every number available for service in hotel and nothing, no one is answering.
So clothes go back on, walk back to reception and join queue of people and wait.....why because there is only one person on reception and no one has the idea to call for support. 
Finally I get to the front and ask again for milk......finding a cow and milking it myself would have been easier.
Go back to room and wait another 10-15 minute and finally someone brings a jug of milk and then attempts to provide excuses.
I don’t want excuses, I just wanted some milk 3 hours ago and then because I won’t listen to him and want to close the door he struts about and suggests I am shouting at him.
Shouting......I wanted to scream but it would have make no difference. if this person wanted to excuse the pathetically poor service by accusing me of shouting then he misses the whole point of the service industry he works in.
There is a sign outside advertising some hotel event soon based around faulty towers, the john Cleese sitcom. When let me assure the hotel,they should have no issue delivering the standards of service the tv show presented.
One not very happy hotel guest....... ☹️",1,2018,01,03
249,The best place ever with the best treatments for all my family,"I came to this hotel with my entire familly. Even though it was a very busy night, I've been delighted to see the outstanding service in the Kudos restaurant from this hotel, especially thanks to Sheela who took care of my entire family with a lot of professionalism. 
She even helped me out with my allergies so I would not get something I can't eat. 
The place is clean and the food was amazing! 
The entire staff was nice and I can only say one thing: go to this place, I highly recommend it. Thanks for making my holidays in Ireland memorable!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) !!!!",5,2018,01,02
249,Very disappointing. Avoid ,We arrived here for New Years celebrations and sadly the room wasn’t up to standards. The bathroom needs updated. There was hair around the plug and the shower is part of the bathtub. A thing of the past in hotels in my opinion. The “double bed” we had was just two singles pushed together witch made sleeping together uncomfortable. The food is all over cooked. The staff seem to leave their personalities at the door. The hotel pool is just a fitness centre next door that you need to take your own padlock to. Or be forced to buy one. Good to know! The pool itself is small and overcrowded. I’m very disappointed with the stay altogether. A very grey hotel. Dublin as a city tho is fantastic. It saved the trip. ,2,2017,12,31
249,great food,Staff were excellent throughout my stay but especially Kevin and Ciaran and the waiting staff who were both friendly and professional at all times. Have to say the food in the restaurant was top class for such a low price. Would highly recommend,5,2017,12,23
249,friendly and helpful staff,"Our room was very comfortable, also found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. It is a great location if you want to visit Liffey valley shopping centre. Would definitely stay there again when in Dublin or had to go to Dublin airport as the airport hopper bus stops there.",4,2017,12,23
249,Special thanks to Oana,"Great place for such low price, i found the staff very helpful especially Oana, great accommodation with such activities such as pool indoor. 
Breakfast was really good which was included in the price.
Very clean place especially the rooms.",5,2017,12,19
249,Average ,"Stayed here last night. Room was nice and comfortable. Bar staff were not very friendly. Breakfast was not good. Ran out of orange juice, bacon, and milk. Had to wait for all 3. It was all a bit manic. ",3,2017,12,17
249,Fantastic food and service,"Had a lovely lunch on  Friday with my friends at KUDOS bar,staff were very helpful and attentive to dishes suitable for vegetarians which was greatly appreciated!! and the food was very tasty indeed!

Many thanks to lovely staff  2 Sharon  and lily.They all made we feel very welcome.",5,2017,12,16
249,Security,Our car was broken into on the 15/12/2017. We were made believe that the car park was secure it has shutters on both sides. It needs to be made clearer that it is not fully secure. I was traumatised and I felt very unfairly treated I don't feel I was dealt with in a manner where a person is in shock. I'm so so upset and the way I was dealt with was not very good is the only way I can put it. The manager was quite confrontational not apologetic at all. Not caring no empathy to my plyth its Christmas I was not happy with the service given. I would like to take it further. Yes I wasn't easy to deal with but I felt because I was a customer and it was on your premises that you could have done more. He actually said it wasn't him that broke into our car and what did we want him to do. I will not be recommending your hotel for that reason,1,2017,12,16
249,Very disappointed,"Everything was an effort, everything went wrong, and no one cared to rectify. I spent 3 hours accumulated at the desk trying to sort out various issues experienced......Wouldnt stay again...Very disappointed",1,2017,12,13
249,Long term business trip,Excellent amenities including pro gym and pool. Within 5 min walk from Liffey Valley. Leo is the coffee barista. Probably best coffee in town. Interiors are cosy but now slightly dated. Cleanliness good. I find the self-catering Apartment Suites ideal for longer business trips. Good internet access.,3,2017,12,12
249,Special Xmas visit,I cannot praise the staff enough of the Clayton hotel Liffey Valley. When I was booking with them I explained it was an extra special trip as the family we travelled with had just been through a very tough year and one of the children we travelled with had just been given the all clear from cancer. The way they had decorated the room all the extras they done for us blew us all away. It was an amazing night away and cannot wait to go back again. The food was amazing and the staff were so helpful and friendly. Thank you to all the staff at the Clayton for making our staff so un believable we enjoyed every second of it! ,5,2017,12,10
249,Good value hotel,"When in west Dublin, we always stay here. Easy drive from airport and good access to motorways.
Beds are always comfortable and the breakfast is good value.
Brilliant bar staff who always go the extra mile for you.
Only down side for me is main restaurant, not into Italian style cooking.
But still a good hotel.",4,2017,12,09
249,Clayton Liffey Valley Hotel,"Just returned from a short break to this hotel:

I had asked for, via email, a room facing the main car park, on a upper floor and near to the lift as I have walking difficulties .. the hotel failed on all 3 requests. We were given a room at the rear of the hotel ... 115 paces from reception !!!. and not on an upper floor

Setting aside these issues , I can say that if you can get a suitable room the quality and overall cleanliness of the rooms is fine. The only downside was that the heating is controlled from a master control and the room was  very cold from about 10pm onward. A heater was asked for the next morning and arrived almost immediately.
 
The food in the restaurant at breakfast and in the bar in the evenings was really good and well served -  good  choice on menu.

Overall I would certainly stay in this hotel in the future , but I would ensure that a ""suitable"" room was selected and confirmed at time of booking.

Some advisory sites rate this hotel as  3* and others as 4*    I would sway towards a 3* but with very little effort it would be a certain 4*.

Yes I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",4,2017,12,08
249,Overnight stay,"Stayed with 2 friends.
Reception good
Room clean and comfortable 
Breakfast food very good with lovely girl serving teas/coffees.
Only negative is charging for car park when staying in hotel.In most hotels this would be complimentary. 
",4,2017,12,08
249,Surprise phone call,"Stayed here for one night last week. Really enjoyed the hotel. Had a lovely meal in the restaurant and went to bed. I woke up at 4:20am with a party going on in the next room. I rang reception who acted on it straight away. They even offered to move me. When I was at a meeting the following that day I received a call from the duty manager who apologized and offered me a compliment in my next stay which will be in two weeks. Great staff, very clean and really focused on customer retention",5,2017,12,04
249,Weekend in Liffey valley clayton,"We stayed here for the first time as 2adults and 2kids. When I booked I wanted to get 2 rooms adjoining but none were available. On check-in I thought I'd ask again  and there was availability, however the receptionist recommended taking a suite (apartment) instead and she was right. The suite was really big, separate bedroom, living room, kitchenette and 2 TVs. An extra 2 beds setup for the kids and the layout worked out much better for our family. However there was an issue with the TVs in the room, contacted the duty manager and he replaced the 2tvs when we returned. Excellent customer service everywhere here. Really professional and friendly staff especially the duty manager on evening of 1st dec that went beyond call of duty to get our TVs sorted for the toy show. 

Breakfast buffet was really good in the hotel and we had dinner also, everything top class for a family.
We also used the pool onsite as well as excessive WiFi use by the kids. 
The hotel is about 5min walk to the massive liffey valley shopping center.
The rate was approx €400 for the suite B&B with an evening meal for the family. 
Overall we had a really good time here and will definitely come back again.

I called in twice and very little help and phoned several times and was assured someone would call me back, never happened  ,,,and I never got the item of clothing back very very disappointed",3,2017,12,02

249,Divine,"Beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff and ideally located just off the m50

Brilliant hotel with secure underground car park and gym/pool centre 

Only downside was the breakfast. It just the overall experience down- the sausages were out of date. 

I wouldn’t let the breakfast be the deciding factor as it is a fabulous hotel",4,2017,11,27
249,Friendly service & Clean,"Nice hotel, friendly staff and clean rooms. The only downside was a noisy family across the room. For a family father trying to get away from kids stuff for a day, is a kind of a downer, but obviously no fault from hotel staff. Attention from Sharan and Sharon in the bar was superb. Thank you.",4,2017,11,23
249,didnt enjoy it,"Went for an all day event, found the hotel amenities very poor. Had to ask 3 different staff members where vending machine was and couldn't find it, a customer showed me in the end. Couldn't buy a drink. Waited for ages at bar near front lobby, no staff nor any signage to indicate where I could find any. Couldn't get the kids a drink of water. Reception staff officious and cold and gave the impression of being annoyed at being asked any questions. Couldn't see a restaurant or anywhere to feed kids. Really didn't enjoy my day here.",2,2017,11,22
249,Lunch,"Would like to thank Sharon & Sharon again for great service during lunch. Service was very friendly and food & coffee was great. I have come to the hotel for lunch on numerous occasions over the past two years and have always found the staff very friendly and service quick.

Sharon on breakfast was super  efficient and helpful, and had business meetings in bar all morning and met another Sharon in the bar, great girl altogether,  really pleasant and attentive. Good meeting point location,  definitely worth coming back as a Base location for meeting clients. Well done.",5,2017,11,22

249,Weekend stay,"Booked for Friday and Saturday night, I thought at first I was too far out from the city, but it is only a short but maybe a little expensive trip in a taxi, if you want to go cheaper the hotel is virtualy on the bus route. We booked in for bed and breakfast, the food was fantastic and the service was great. The rooms are very clean and well had every thing we needed for a great stay.",4,2017,11,16
249,Food and staff could not have been any more accomodating,"I lunch here every week and I have to say Both OF THE Sharon's are fun, kind, friendly staff members, They always make you feel comfortable and cannot do enough for you, If one is not around the other is always there on hand.

249,Good for business meetings with attendants  from outside Dublin,Average hotel with rooms needing refurbishment. Perhaps will come with the name change to Clayton Hotels? It is conveniently placed to held business meeting with attendants coming from outside Dublin. The restaurant (Italian food) and breakfast are OK.,3,2017,11,14

249,Lunch review,"I regularly visit the Clarion Hotel in Liffey Valley to meet colleagues for lunch or to use as a base to get some work done for a couple of hours. The food is good with a food counter where you can get sandwiches, salads and soup. There is also a menu for hot food, the 'Best Ever Curry' is always a winner. The staff are particularly friendly, there is always a friendly welcome and chat from the two Sharon's who look after everyone so well.",4,2017,11,11
249,"Great coffee, lovely service!","I go for coffee and lunch frequently in this hotel as I go to the (excellent) gym there. The staff are lovely and friendly. There are 2 ladies called Sharon, blonde Sharon and brunette Sharon I call them LOL! They are always friendly and make time to chat, especially to older people, who seem to appreciate it. The coffee is excellent, if a little pricy.  They have just started a loyalty card scheme however, which helps as you only need to buy 5 to get 1 free. Happy days! The only thing I don't like is the amount of people who sit (usually in the nicest seats by the windows) on their laptops not even ordering a drink! My friends and I then have to sit in the dark bar. If they opened the double doors  (even keeping the area cordoned off) it would be much brighter in there. ",5,2017,11,11
249,Great hotel excellent service,"I stayed here with my wife and children over the mid term break brilliant hotel especially  the breakfast buffet there was a great selection of food that catered for all my familys tastes.the service was outstanding a lady in particular called  sharon greeted us every morning and by day two she even knew what hot beverage we liked she always had a smile on her face even when one  our kids spilled over there juice she was very accommodating and got us a new one. She is helpful,  friendly,  efficient and very professional at her job. She is an asset to your company. I have been to many hotels for  breakfast  and yours really made it stress free eating  with the kids and the  kindness of sharon towards our kids. We will definitely  be back in the near future",5,2017,11,10
249,Birthday Celebration,"Third visit to this hotel and unfortunately will not be back had booked three rooms for  family celebration staying with three  children under three , two of the  rooms not available untill 5.40pm  which was totally unacceptable staff tried to sort rooms stating reason housekeeping staff had not turned up for work really was total shambles",2,2017,11,08

249,Dance competition,"Really early to arrive at the hotel from the airport. Couldn't check in any earlier but able to use the facilities and walk to the local shopping complex.

249,"excellent service, very clean,staff very professional.","This was our first stay and all of us really enjoyed the four night stay.   The two bedroom app was in excellent condition. very clean, and enjoyed great views.    Breakfast had something for everybody and was very enjoyable.   The evening meal menu was extensive and thanks to Ivanna the service and presentation was very good.   The leisure centre was clean and staff again very helpful.    Over all we could find no basis for any complaint.    To the management and staff, a very big thank you.    We will definitely be back for another visit",5,2017,11,05
249,Tired Hotel in need of refurb.,We booked in for 2 nights. Our room was supposed to be Family size but I found pokey. No AC only fan supplied. I didnt think the room was as clean as it could have been.. i found hairs in the bathroom & they were not ours! Breakfast was good. Swimming pool has seen better days. Was shocked to find we were being charged for parking in the hotel we stayed in.  I complained at Reception and was given complimentary parking which i appreciated.  All in all.. i was not impressed and will not book again as a little extra cash would ensure better quality.,2,2017,11,05
249,What a hell hole,I should have guesses this place was going to be crap when they rang me to confirm booking 4 hours after checking in. The only good thing about this place is Natalie in the bar. If she quits avoid!!!!,1,2017,11,04
249,Great Service,"I regularly stay here for business and my experience is always enjoyable thanks to helpful/welcoming staff, with special mention for Patrycja in restaurant who always has a great welcome for me after a long day.",4,2017,11,03
249,Good sports facilities,"Not a bad option after all. Staff is friendly and I want to acknowledge one of receptionists, Alina. She is knowledgeable, has a positive attitude  and a friendly disposition.

249,Poor service + Management V Friendly Staff,"Superb location with friendly and helpful staff, this unfortunately is where the customer experience ends. Service from room to bar to restaurant was a disaster primarily due to a lack of management and coordination. This was not just our family experience but was similar to numerous other family’s we met during our stay. To make matters worse, numerous families were left standing or retiring to their rooms early as there was limited seating available. Unfortunately Mr Clayton, location alone does not make up for poor service!",2,2017,10,29
249,Home from Home,"Have been working in Dublin for the last seven months and staying at the Clarion.                         
The Clarion has been a great place to stay with good facilities including the Gym,Pool and on site restaurants.
The staff are what makes it a great place to stay though,in particular to Kevin and Natalie who are always warm and friendly and a great double act in Kudos Bar.
Similarly In Gusto's Ivo and Sharron on breakfast and Leonela on the evening staff.
Hats off to them all and all the staff who run this hotel.
Will certainly be coming back.

249,Excellent hotel and extra special staff,"Have been stopping at the hotel now for over two weeks and cannot fault it in anyway. Every single member of staff are so friendly especially Kev,Ina,Patrica and Natalie in kudos and on breakfast Sharon. The management team have been so helpful to us and Simon the GM especially. Would be pleased to come back again
",5,2017,10,25
249,Good Location for shopping.  Would stay again,"Room was spacious and clean.  Decent blackout curtains.  Nice food for dinner and breakfast was good also.  Really nice coffees available at the bar.  Great location for shopping in Liffey Valley.  Staff were pleasant and very helpful and went the extra mile by leaving a fruit bowl, chocolates and bottled water, this was a lovely surprise.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2017,10,24
249,Night away with wife ,"What a disappointment, 1st our room looked out onto a stairway.
2nd my wife went for a bath and discovered when leaving the bath there were no bath towels, called reception while she waited in the bath, bearing in mind she is 8 months pregnant, after 10 minutes still no towels had to call again.
3rd, breakfast was hideous, staff were poor after having to call someone for tea and coffee it was left on our table with no cups. Final had to go and get them ourselves to discover there was no milk, food was all over cooked, we just left at this stage.
Stay away this place is like faulty towers ",1,2017,10,22
249,Poor Customer Service,"We made arrangements 60 days in advance using our hotel points to stay at this hotel for three nights.  After driving through afternoon traffic in Dublin to this location we were told by the desk that our hotel location had moved.  They had our telephone number and email address but had failed to inform us of a change.  They told us that they could not reach us by telephone because they could not get through, we have had our telephone number for over twenty years.  They told us that arrangements had been made at another hotel for us close to the airport.  It took us two hours to find this airport hotel since no map or worthwhile directions were offered.  When we finally reached the Clayton Hotel they knew nothing about the move and the manager had to call them to verify this change.  We were never offered an apology for this change, we had to pay for tolls on M50 to return to the Clayton.   Choice Privilege collectors may be bumped.",1,2017,10,21
249,"Clean, friendly but menus not the same as online","We booked in here for 1 night due to an unexpected change in travel circumstances.

Hotel is very clean and helpful, the hotel is huge and the lifts are not adequate, when you get to your floor you can walk miles to your room.

Room was large with good facilities, however attention needed to the laundry our bed sheets had a stain by the pillow as did one of the towels.

Leisure facilities are open to the public and are busy. Was very hard to swim.

We only booked this hotel based on the on line food menu and the kudos bar with its Asian menu we were really looking forward to something different. 
We needed to eat early due to our little girl needing an early night. We went to the kudos bar which was supposed to open at 6, restaurant didn't open until 6:30. The menu was disappointing and wasn't as the online version. It lacked choice and personality, we decided to move to the ""Italian"" (term used lightly) restaurant we ordered a sharing board priced at £9.95 per person. When this board arrived it was tiny. I questioned this with the staff who advised its a 1 person sharing board and not for two people. I tried to explain that we ordered the sharing board to share i.e. needing enough for two people but it was completely lost on the staff.
We then ordered some dough balls these were very hard and not doughy at all.

They homemade pizzas were also disappointing. If we didn't have a small we most certainly would have upped and left for another restaurant in the city.

249,Great service ,We visited the Clarion hotel and were served lovely food by Ina who was very pleasant! Patrycja behind the bar was also very friendly. Always a plus to have good friendly staff! I come to the Clarion on a regular basis and find it very convenient (next to M50) and shopping close by too. The gym is excellent and rooms are very modern. Shane ,5,2017,10,05
249,Excellent Service,"What really sets this hotel apart from all others and gives you the best service, is its friendly staff who are polite, prompt, cheerful and always happy to help. If we could single out two people who encapsulates this excellent spirit of customer service, it would be the two Sharon's in the Lunch / Bar area. Their friendly and welcoming manner is exceptional. It is the friendly, attentive and quick service that they give, that allows our company use this location for our business lunches and dinners.

It is the kind and considerate nature of the staff that is the success of this hotel.

249,Grand place to stay for short overnight,"This hotel is fine . I would rate it a 3 star, definitely not a 4 star .
Perfect for  a short  overnight stay. 
There was only two  of us. We ended up with a room with 3 beds( a family room?)
No chair in the room..... Difficult to use to desk writing up any reports with only beds.... and not one single chairs....... Don't need 3 beds, when 1 bed would be fine....",3,2017,10,04
249,Wonderful Service & Amazing Food,"Myself and a few friends met up for lunch in the Clarion Hotel, Liffey Valley. The service we received from the two staff, both named Sharon, was just incredible. The food was absolutely delicious and along with the service from the two girls made our visit more memorable.  We will definitely be back again.

249,Outstanding Service and Nice Hotel,"We have had our lunch at the Kudos bar for the last two days in a row. It has an incredibly nice atmosphere and the food was delicious. We had the chilli chow mein and one of the best tasting curry's I have ever had. Every staff we encountered was friendly and helpful especially from Sharon L, Coco and Lily. Will definitely be back again!",5,2017,10,01
249,You don't always get what you ask for.,"I booked an overnight stay for 2 people room only on Hotels.com, in special requests I said i was looking for an accessible room with an accessible bathroom, on the confirmation I received it clearly said only shower in ensuite which suited me fine.
When I checked in I was told to press 1 in the lift so I did that, it was a mile and a half before we reached our room (not exaggerating) and just beside our room was a lift that went down to the ground floor and you only had to walk down a corridor to reach reception, just image if I wasn't able for that on the night.  The room itself, well what can I say, the bathroom was far from accessible, their was a bath in it  with a shower that couldn't be moved, the beds were hard as a rock.  We were told at reception that there was no breakfast room service but online it says 24 hour room service and in the room there was a menu and on it was written and I quote 24 HOUR ROOM SERVICE.
One thing that kind of shocked me a little, well I asked the receptionist at 8pm that evening do we have to order a taxi or do they park out the front, some hotels have that service, she asked me where we were going, I told her and her response was ah sure thats only 5 minutes walk, now it may be 5 minutes to her but for me who has a disability first of all and secondly we would be 2 women walking in the dark, what is wrong with this person, I wish I could remember her name.  I know checking out she asked me was everything ok, I wanted to say well we werent kidnapped thank you but I was just too tired and annoyed to bother.  I don't know if I would stay here again, the sad part is I use to stay regularly in the past.",3,2017,10,01
249,"Very unprofessional, intimidating staff","This review would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for the appalling ""customer service"". Myself and three friends booked one night here as we were going to a concert in the city and it seemed like a great deal. Having arrived an hour early for check in thinking we would just drop off our bags in a luggage room, we were pleasantly surprised that we were allowed into the room. Reception booked us a taxi and we left around 1.30pm. We arrived back to the hotel at around midnight, and very quietly made our way up the stairs and down to our room, which was a lengthy walk from reception. As we were going up the stairs the two men standing at reception were very intimidating, staring at us the whole way. As we knew it was late we stayed very quiet walking the whole way back to our room, but having got there I was disgusted to turn around and see one of the receptionists had followed us all the way. I was so angry to even confront him then, so decided I would mention it to reception the next morning when checking out. 
After breakfast I told the receptionist on duty what had happened the night previously and I said we felt it wasn't very professional and that's not how guests should be made felt. However she said it was only the security guard doing his round of the floors and he simply came upon us as we got to our room. I told her this was not the case, as I could clearly see it was one of the men who was standing at reception so it was not just a coincidence he ""came upon us"". She then changed her story to say there was a complaint further down the hallway so he was simply following up on that. I then told her that was not possible as we were staying in the last room on that hallway (365). Hearing this she changed her tune and refused to listen anymore, stating he simply wasn't following us. We felt completely discriminated against and I would hate to think other guests would be made feel the same way. ",1,2017,10,01
249,Home from home,"Been staying here since February now in one of the appartments that they offer. Very handy for long term business travellers as it's more homely than a normal hotel room. The hotel does need some money spent on it and could do with being modernised but all in all it has everything you need.

The restaurants and bar do sometimes struggle when the hotel is at capacity, it can get very busy but the staff are great even if occasionally there isn't enough. Kevin and Natalie do an excellent job in the bar and never keep you waiting for a refill. Mariana and Nicole are great in the Gusto restaurant, they will always find you a table even when it gets busy.",4,2017,09,29
249,Business and Family friendly,"I travel regularly to Dublin on business and will always try to stay here. It's ease of access to the M50 puts most of Dublin within easy reach. There is also a selection of restaurants so there's always variety for returning guests. The waitstaff could not be more welcoming and helpful, namely Leonela in Gusto and Sharon at breakfast always remembers a face and has a chat. 

The hotel is also great for families, with the pool and child play zone there's plenty to do on the occasions the family join me on a trip.",5,2017,09,28

Great staff but menu is long overdue for a change",3,2017,09,20
249,Superb staff,I use the Clarion regularly for meetings and I have to say that the staff are second to none. Friendly engaging and always so willing to help.

249,Not up to standard,"Our ""Non smoking room"" had more smoke in it than a Japanese casino. The residents bar which had a group of approx 20 people at it shut up at 12:30 leaving an angry and thirsty group. Breakfast buffet kept running short on food and the staff were slow to re-fill. Also went through the entire breakfast without being offered tea/coffee. Disappointing in all.",2,2017,09,18

249,Modern hotel in the suburbs,This modern American style hotel is located in a suburban area near a shopping mall and about 20 minutes from the center of town.  There are a few restaurants nearby.  I booked an executive suite and was told that the hotel no longer had them in their inventory due to a sale but the web site keeps selling them.  Received a standard room instead.  Due to the heavy doors that slam the hotel can be quite noisy if busy and some rooms face a loud highway.   The TV did not work and we were told that it would be fixed when we got back but it was not.  A manager had to come to the room and fix it.  I did not use the pool because you had to buy a shower cap in order to take advantage of it.  Get directions to the bus downtown when you arrive.  We took the slow bus and it took forever to get to Temple Bar.,3,2017,09,13
249,I want to go back,"We arrived at this seemingly average hotel to find we had an amazing room. Actually not a room more like an apartment. It was absolutely beautiful and spacious. There was a whole kitchen area, large lounge and dining area, hallway, large bedroom and beautiful bathroom. I can't recommend this enough. Booked through Ryan air at a very reasonable price. Don't all go booking now as I need a room there soon.
",5,2017,09,12
249,Potential .. okay. Disappointing ,"Arrived to reception. From underground carpark. Feels a bit like a airport or bus station area.  Helpful check in. Went to room. Basic sized family room. Small bathroom. Hangers no wardrobe. View of motorways very noisy.  Room too warm but there was a working. fan and fridge.  Bathroom drains gave off bad smell which got worse.  We had unpacked before we realised to get to swimming pool which closed at 7pm.  Swimming pool good enough. Hat required.  Very busy. Swimming lessons on.  Back to room. Housekeeping said the smell wouldn't go and we could change to room downstairs. We were unpacked and kids tired so didn't bother.   Went down the kudos restaurant we wee told was closed as hotel wasn't.l busy enough.  So we are in restaurant. Nice views and window seat but the service was incredibly slow. We were there over 2 hours waiting between meal and desert.  Staff were very pleasant. Run off feet mostly.   The toilets in foyer were filthy and no loo roll. The male toilets were covered in vomit.  
All in all this hotel seems unloved and has potential which sadly really spoilt our stay.   ",3,2017,09,12
249,nice and relaxing,just back from a family weekend and cant say anything bad .. clean..  great steak.. good size pool .. only thing was there was not many in the bar so the crack was minimal but kevin made the crack as he was great with kids and adults,4,2017,09,10
249,"Clean, comfortable, convenient","Nothing special, but good value for our two night stay. Easy access to Dublin's fine public transportation systems and helpful staff made this a good choice. Much more affordable than places closer to downtown, but with the easy and frequent bus service, getting to Dublin's attractions is no problem. Airport access is good and inexpensive using the airport hopper shuttle service. A large shopping center is nearby if that's of interest.",3,2017,09,05
249,No respect ,We have booked and when we arrived they said no space and there is a company how booked all rooms which is impossible because we booked room when there was sale 😡💩 .. also they have the worst reception ever,1,2017,09,04
249,Disgraceful,"My family and I had booked to stay here for one night. When we were on the way up to Dublin, I got a phone call from the hotel to say that the hotel was being sold that day and that they were moving all their guests to other hotels. They were moving us to Tallagh which was the other end of town and didn't suit us. I asked would we be getting a discount as it was extremely short notice and she said we wouldnt. Surely the hotel would have known a closing date of the sale of the hotel.  ",1,2017,09,02
249,Dangerous room- no response from management,"I was told I had an UPGRADE as I was staying for 2 weeks!
My room was dangerous! No way to turn on lights on entering and door would not stay open to provide light whilst you struggled to find an unstable standard lamp on other side of room. Same problem from bed - no light switch by bed so staggering about in the dark to find lamp, which broken bulb with exposed mains for the 2 weeks I stayed!
Heater control had 'Out of Order' sign on it for the two weeks
Although fridge and room service booked neither existed
Bed was made three times in 2 weeks!
Safe was so high manager could not reach it, I had to stand on a chair to reach in!
Had to go outside to reach restaurant and reception - got wet going to and from breakfast most days!
Complaints to management - no response after 2 weeks - even though room visited and manager agreed with faults raised
Complaints to head office IRELAND no reply in two weeks - tried to phone - automated response just says dial the same number!
Tried calling head office USA - although 'My call was important to them' they could not bring themselves to answer it!!",1,2017,08,31
249,Very Happy,Stayed here just one night foe my birthday in July with my Girlfriend. I never stay in hotels much in Dublin only when I go away. Mainly because I go away!! So dont see a point in staying in one here!! Anyways this place is nice and has me reconsidering! We got an apartment(suite) for the night across from the main building. Lovely it was very cosy. Beds comfy nice bathroom sitting room and kitchen. Didn't make use of the pool or gym so cannot comment. Main building is nice and breakfast was brilliant one of the best Ive had in any hotel. It is a stone's throw away to liffey valley shopping centre which has starbucks food courts and a cinema along with the shopping. Directly across the road from the hotel is a lovely bar and carvery called The Arc. I would highly recommend this hotel if your driving its a lovely spot and well placed of the m50. I'll surely be back again.,4,2017,08,30
249,Bad stay ,Decide to stay here family of 2 adults and 3 child's stayed in room 214 room. Got to the hotel about 7 and ask was pool still opened for kids and was told it was but when we got to the pool at 7:10 was told it was closed at 7. Went to the bar for food it was busy so we sat at the front part of the bar and was told no food aloud in the front bar and come back later bit of a attitude but there was no other tables free but on the second tonight went down to the bar and there was a table of men in the sits I was in eating food and watching a match. We ended up get a pizza delivered on our first night and the second night fire alarm going off after 11pm which woke my 2 year old and my 6 month old went down to reception and was told they are fixing it 5 mins later knock on my door telling me to evacuate the floor and by the time got to reception was told that they thought it was smoke and to go back to my room  all in all first night there had to get a pizza delivered for the whole family after being told come back later to the bar and restaurant  the second night was spent listening to a fire alarm wouldn't recommend for a family but if it's only a bed your looking for the I would recommend. ,1,2017,08,30
249,Actavo Cup,"I have recently returned from Dublin where our Newcastle United Under 14 Academy team participated in the Actavo Cup. We were very fortunate to be accommodated in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley where for the duration of our stay we could not have received better service and hospitality. Having been abroad on various tours this season I can certainly say that the hotel did us proud. The rooms were spotless each day, the meals were superb and perfect for our boys and the customer service provided by the hotel staff could not have been bettered. The additional facility of the swimming pool meant that our boys could use it to recover after the tournament matches which was a boon. We have been invited to return to the tournament next season and if the Clarion is part of the invitation then we will certainly be hoping to return.",5,2017,08,30
249,Love the place,"We live local and always seem to end up back in Kudos.  Its simple the food has always been fantastic and presentation we have never faulted.  We have 4 children that are always looked after amazingly by the really super staff especially Ina and Patrycja, nothing is ever a problem to them. Thats why we always come back.",5,2017,08,29
249,Great service at the Clarion by Sharon! ,"Wonderful service at the Clarion Hotel. Great stop after we got off the plane from Canada. The hotel rooms were good, superior rooms have King beds even though they call them large double beds. The only shortcoming was the Wifi. The wifi connection was very spotty so an investment may be required. However the star of the Clarion Dublin was a wonderful server named Sharon. Her outstanding Customer Service made our stay very memorable. I am gluten / dairy allergies and she was so helpful and accommodating. She was also very accommodating to my very jet lagged family. Special call out as well for the great front desk team that looked after us and the tall bartender at Kudos bar. 

Food was really great in bar and restaurant with generous servings.   Great stay we will come back! ",5,2017,08,24
249,Great hotel for everything,"Brilliant hotel lovely staff, wonderful food and great amenities for the kids. Our room was very clean and even had a fridge. Close to a great shopping centre and only 20 mins from Tayto Park will definitely be back.",5,2017,08,23
249,Review not happy.,"Lovely hotel, absolutely wonderful staff, very helpful but the food was a nightmare,
Had two things to choose from every night something or fish. The desert is extremely small and not worth it, wouldn't recommend the hotel at all. Breakfast is also cold every morning especially the bacon absolutely disgraceful.",2,2017,08,17
249,"Clean, spacious & great breakfast","Family of 4, stayed in room 216, it had everything we needed. Adequate size and clean room.
Used the Pool/Gym whilst there, both were great & the pool was warm & clean, liked the family cubicles for changing.
Breakfast was great, although the kids were disappointed there were no pancakes - there were however lots of other things they liked.
Only downside - the bar area is lacking atmosphere, and we had a bit of a wait for our room even though we arrived to check in after 4pm.",4,2017,08,17
249,A real treat for a weekend break ,"We chose this hotel almost exclusively on price. The location is not city centre, so the rooms cost less.

But the hotel is great. Staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms was spotlessly clean and well serviced daily. 

The hotel breakfast was excellent and the full Irish breakfast was a treat. 

The location is great if like us you like to use public transport to explore a city, or if you hire a car it's a very easy journey. 

In walking distance there is a range of shops, several bars and restaurants (which where fantastic). 

We would strongly recommend this place and will be back ourselves. Dublin is wonderful. ",5,2017,08,15
249,Back again four years later for a weekend break,"We stayed here for a family weekend break - it was nice to be back in this hotel. We had a very nice family room with enough space for our family of five. The cot we requested was already set up in the room, and it was very clean and tidy. We appreciated the fridge in the room, and the full size bath in the bathroom. The girls in reception were very friendly and helpful. The morning buffet breakfast in the Gusto Restaurant was very nice (as we remembered it), with very tasty scrambled egg. Friendly staff again, who offered colouring packs to our girls whilst the grown-ups finished their leisurely breakfast. Our girls also enjoyed the kids indoor play area situated on the ground floor on the way up towards the bedrooms. There is also a nice outdoor playground situated behind the annex block with the suites. A nice touch. Only a couple of negatives...some cleaning staff refused to hold the lift for my wife when she was carrying our youngest downstairs which was not nice, and you have to pay for car parking (€6 per day), which I can't recall every paying on our previous visit. However for the location, and the facilities which this hotel offers, you can't beat it.",4,2017,08,14
249,Good base for Dublin City ,"For a quick visit to Dublin, this was a perfect base. Staff were lovely. Room was spotless, family room included double bed and two proper singles , not a fold up. They have a lovely pool in the leisure centre. Breakfast was buffet style which was fine. They had lots of a activities for children, movie nights etc. We just didn't have enough time. Would stay here again. ",4,2017,08,12
249,Microwaved kids food??,"Second time staying at this hotel for the Dublin Zoo/Tayto Park package. It's a good base for travelling around Dublin. One of the evenings however we ordered Chicken fillet, with mash & vegetables for the children thinking lets get them a healthy dinner tonight instead of chips & sausages. I have to say it was appalling! The chicken was clearly baked in the oven at some point earlier in the day and then part heated and served to my kids half cold, with half cold mash. It was awful! We sent this back and it was returned now hotter, on a hot plate this time, so clearly microwaved to heat! The chips & sausages would have been fresher I would think! I'm not a one to normally complain but this is not acceptable in my opinion!! The hotel sells this 'kid friendly' hotel image but in my opinion it's a token gesture for more customers!!! Two of the 4 customers here were children who are being served crap food! I will not be returning! ",1,2017,08,11
249,Not Good🙁,"We stayed here on a recent trip to Dublin Zoo, from the outset our experience was very poor. I did request a room away from the noisy road which did not happen, the room was extremely warm with only a fan to cool the place, this could not be left on during the night as it was very noisy so with the heat in the room along with the road noise led to a very broken night sleep. In the morning the breakfast was a complete disaster, the buffet food was warm not hot, the lady walking around with the tea pots must have our tea pot on her tray for some time because the tea was cold when I poured it. We left this hotel feeling tired and disappointed as we had paid quite a lot of money for this hotel. Unfortunately we will not be returning.",1,2017,08,10
249,A good break and good value,"An ideal base for a short family break.
Rooms clean and tidy. Some corridor noise.
Breakfast, especially the porridge is a must. Gustos a bit pricey. Parking easy to do. Convenient for accessing outside Dublin destinations.",4,2017,08,10
249,"Great night, great hotel ","I recently stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend as a break away for my birthday. Never been to this hotel before but will definitely be returning! The facilities are out of this world and the local shopping centre is amazing! And it's walking distance away! We spoke to Paul, one of the managers there who was extremely friendly and helped us settle in great. I was very impressed with Paul as he was taking time out of his day to speak with guests personally to ensure they were enjoying themselves and having the best experience possible. Unfortunately I didn't get into the pool on this trip as we had lots planned but when I return I'll make sure I'm in it! Great staff and great location! ",4,2017,08,10
249,Training Days #sydsaid,"Stayed at this property last week for a 2 day training course. Arrived early on the first day as I was travelling up from the country, and enjoyed a lovely breakfast on arrival, plenty of options between the Buffet and Continental, I even enjoyed 2 poached eggs. The training days were in the Myra Suite on the first floor, room up to standard and myself and my colleagues were treated frequent refreshments which was well needed. In the evening when I eventually did get to my room it was fine, I was given a king room, clean and comfortable. On my final day I requested a late checkout and this was granted with no issues. Thank you all for a great stay.........P.S. Special Shoutout to Kayleigh the restaurant supervisor who has to be one of the most enthusiastic people I have ever met, no task to big or too small for her. Girl Your Totally Amazeballs! Thanks for everything!",3,2017,08,09
249,Never fails ,"We have just recently returned from a little trip to Dublin, I always look to book The Clarion in Liffey Valley as you know what you get. Great service, great staff, great rooms you cannot fault it. 
Only situated about 15mins outside of Dublin but very accessible via the motorway & public transport. 
Liffey Valley shopping centre only a 10mins walk away also. 
Thanks again all. ",5,2017,08,08
249,Great family hotel,Extremely comfortable family room with 2 proper single beds for the children as well as the kingsize - all v v comfy. Lovely friendly and helpful reception staff. Great food in both restaurants. Great breakfast club. Pool is lovely with great kids pool and the best sauna i've ever been in. Ample parking. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2017,08,04
249,Great location,"We stayed here with our two young children recently! Reception staff very friendly and attentive! Hotel was very child friendly with kids clubs etc! Our room was clean and plenty of room in it! Bedrooms very warm which meant we all had a terrible sleep, their was a fan in the room which helped but produced a lot of noise! Cost €6 to park in the car park! I found breakfast a big let down I always look forward to a hotel breakfast but it seemed to be unorganised! We were seated at a table with only one cup and it look 10 mins to get a staff members attention to get us another one for our tea! The orange juice tasted like it had been watered down! Defiantly wasn't pure orange! My husband went to get juice on 2 occasions where there were no glasses left! And also no teapots available to make our tea until another guest asked for some! Other than that overall we had a good time! ",3,2017,08,03
249,What friendly staff especially Payel & Brigitte in reception .,"Lovely hotel , On arrival we were checked in by Payel  very welcoming and what a nice suite  she assigned us to .. it was absolutely fabulous - words will not descibe it ! luxurious furnishings etc and the most comfortable bed . We were part of a group of six that had reserved a table in Gusto - a delightful experience with friendly staff and good service . Breakfast was lovely with a great selection . On checking out we met Brigitte who had the most wonderful smile and personality . These two girls should both be considered for employee of the month . They are sure happy in their jobs . We had stayed on at least two or three other occassions and this time we will not wait as long for a return visit .  Thanks Girls .  .",5,2017,08,02
249,Birthdays ,"In the Clarion Hotel liffey Valley for the weekend as it was our daughters birthday and our neice's birthday also. We had a lovely break in the Clarion Hotel. It was great the staff are lovely especially Kayleigh and Jamie in the restaurant at breakfast and the room was lovely too, very clean and the bed was so comfortable.",5,2017,08,02
249,Terrible reception service lets down decent hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights en route to visit family in Mayo. At first glance appears to be a really nice hotel; clean and modern but...the reception staff! Oh my word I have never come across a more incompetent array of disinterested people. The lady who 'welcomed' us didn't even bother to acknowledge the fact we were waiting and just gave us 'that glare'. Anyway we checked in, much to her inconvenience and headed to the room which I have to day was lovely, again very clean and with all amenities you'd expect. 

Dinner was incredibly average; I had meatballs in arriabiata sauce which had about as much kick as an invalid duck, really disappointing but we figured we'd just eat somewhere else the next night. Breakfast was ok. Everything you could want if you like greasy hash browns and rubbery scrambled egg but it was nice to see gluten free options at least. Staff were slow but pleasant. 

We ordered room service pizza the second night which took over an hour to arrive! Pretty nice though although I was bloody starving.

But the worst part of our stay was to come... I stupidly managed to leave our passports in the room safe and it took 3 weeks to get them back. I was messed around so much I was considering going to the police. Firstly, having arranged with reception the time and date they'd be collected, they told the courier that the duty manager wasn't available to release them. Surely the point of a duty manager is that er, they're always on duty to manage?? The situation then turned into something not unlike a farcical comedy show. One receptionist after another told me they'd call me back within an hour or half an hour, and not one out of the 8 or so times I called honoured this. Utterly inept and unprofessional. One even mistook the word 'passports' and kept referring to them as wedding rings. I actually thought they were either taking the p*** or in the process of defrauding me. Luckily they were just taking the p***

249,"Nice Hotel, Great Staff","Stayed here during a business trip, never been to this area before but the hotel was easy to find being right off the main road. It's close to the main Liffey Valley Shopping complex (10 minute walk) and right next to a nice bar/restaurant area. The room was very comfortable, clean and had everything needed. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as we felt the prices were a wee bit over the top but crossed the road and had a great bar meal in the local pub. Breakfast was good, everything piping hot in the buffet selection. Only negative was no cash machine in the hotel, (which would have been handy to pay for drinks in the hotel bar) the nearest was located in the Shopping Centre itself so be prepared to walk there or to charge things on your debit/credit card. Would stay here again when in the area.",4,2017,07,31
249,Excellent hotel with wonderful staff,"Our whole family booked into this hotel for 2 nights to celebrate my father in laws 70th birthday. We ranged from age 70 down to babies of 7 months. 22 of us in total. 
From the moment we arrived we were treated so well by everyone we met. 
Check in was easy and quick. 
Myself and my husband's room in particular was spectacular. It was our first night away from our 2 kids since having the younger baby and this was a special treat. A huge open plan room with a small kitchen, massive bed, enormous balcony, beautiful bathroom with separate shower and bath and twin sinks
We couldn't have asked for a more wonderful room. 
All 22 of us went to dinner together and the service in the resturant was top notch. Waiters and management all stopped by regularly to make sure we were happy and ok. 
Food was delicious. And very reasonably priced. 
We retreated to the bar for the remainder of the night and again service was excellent, they had a fantastic 3 piece band playing who came and sang personally to my father in law. 

A fantastic hotel. We will be back. ",5,2017,07,26
249,Very plesant service from the 'Two Sharons',Called today for first time aroun 1.30pm... Just had soup... Must say we found the staff (especially the Two Sharons) to be very pleasant and obliging... We will be back again very soon - Sean and Patricia Creedon.,5,2017,07,25
249,Almost perfect ,Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband and 2 toddlers. Lovely clean hotel. Friendly staff. Bedroom was really good size. Had dinner one night in the hotel. It was really nice. My boys loved the pizza. We used the swimming pool one of the days and couldn't fault it one bit. Was so clean and fab facilities. The only 2 things that left it down. Was the heat in the room it was boiling at night. There was a fan in the room when we arrived which we had to have on the whole time. The think that let it down is the kids playroom/teen room. Everything was broken and really old and dirty looking. Really needs a bit of attention. But would def stay here again on our next visit to Dublin. My 3 year old cried leaving as he loved the hotel so much,5,2017,07,25
249,Fantastic,"What can i say about this hotel, from the employee i spoke too when i booked to the check in staff and everyone else, nothing was too much. Bedrooms where clean and very well kept, amenities within the rooms are great. Will be back as both myself and my family enjoyed our stay. Got this at a good price as there was a very big concert on this night, still high but nothing on other hotels in Dublin. Breakfast was great, staff with you with in mins.

If there was one thing that could be improved is the kids that either stand outside the walk way in or that come into lobby / the sit down / bar area asking for money. This is very off putting and should be stopped. The little girl who got money off me ( as we walked in) had a card with nine or ten lines filled in with amounts of €10 to €15 , making you feel this is what you give ( i didnt), when i gave money she told me she had no pen to sign card. Boy who came in to lobby / sit down / bar area and was doing the same thing, this was in the space of an hour and a half. I didnt give this time, but a few people next to me did.99",5,2017,07,24
249,Fantastic ,"Stayed in clarion for 5 nights food was good but have to say the staff were fantastic especially Kevin & Natalie really friendly & helpful would recommend it & would stay again really nice hotel & room was very nice
",5,2017,07,22
249,Gusto Italian restaurant ,"I visited Gusto Italian restaurant after probably 8-9 months and it was a bit of a let down .
Firstly , I could barely recognise any staff and that definitely made a big difference , only 1 staff ( Indian girl ) don't remember her name was from the older team and did good job on the night .
Secondly , Pizza wasn't the same either I think the chef is gone gone to .
I hope they fix these small issues so we can cone back and enjoy dinner like before .
Thanks

249,Certainly not the 4 star hotel they claim to be,"I stayed one night for work.
Due to delays at airport I checked in at 11.40pm. I asked the man in reception if bar was still open which told me it was. I put my bag in room and headed to bar to get glass of wine. I tried to charge it to my room but was told I hadn't set this up at reception. ..I'd even told him I was going to get a drink! !!!! 
So then had to go back to room to get money.  Not impressed after very long day.  I also hadnt eaten so wanted food from room service, but the only thing on offer was a choice of 4 cold sandwiches, so I went to bed with no food 
Then at breakfast I was walked all the way round whole restaurant to find me the right table, had to find someone to bring me a hot drink,  and there was no scrambled egg, no fried eggs, no mushrooms, cheap tasteless sausages, cold baked beans and over cooked hash browns. 
My room was lovely and roomy and clean,  but the catering and service really let it down
I stayed in 3 star jury's inn in Belfast the following night and received 5 star service all round. 
Very disappointed
",2,2017,07,21
249,"Lovely stay, great for families","I booked the 2 day family package including breakfast dinner 1 night with entry to the Tayto park which was great value at €339.
Check in was very easy, staff were polite and friendly, the hotel itself was great and lots to offer for families, my 2 boys aged 7 and 3 went to the kids club both nights and had a great time there was also a movie zone available, the only thing was finding out about these as the hotel didn't really promote them, we just came across it by accident.
Our room was lovely and clean, the beds were comfortable and the hotel was relatively quiet at night, the only drawback was the lack of airconditioning however they did provide a fan which we definitely needed.
Breakfast was great, there was lots of choice and quality was good, we ate in Gusto the service was excellent price wasn't too bad and the food was beautiful 3 courses for 2 adults and 2 children including our drinks came to €74
Location is good aswell 20 minute drive to Dublin city center or catch the nearest bus about a 10minute walk away, there's a great shopping Centre near and plenty of restaurants too.
Overall I would highly recommend as a great hotel for the family",5,2017,07,20
249,Just OK,"Just back from staying here for 2 nights.Hotel was neat and room was excellent.The issue I had was more to do with the attitude of some of the staff.On check in it took about ten minutes to have our room assigned.Even though it was passed check in time the receptionist had to make some phone call to check the room was ready.I would have expected that a room would have been allocated.For cash paying customers an extra deposit of 50 euros is requested for security.How ever I decided to pay by debit card which did not require any addition cost.
In the bar at 16.00 I ordered a plain ham sandwich .The server told me to take a seat and at 16.25 I had to return and request the sandwich which took another 10 minutes.I was offered a drink for the error ,however I feel that it does not take 30 minutes for a sandwich.Later on in the bar I found the staff to be under pressure and this showed in their attitude to the customers.Breakfast was way over price and I just opted for a coffee to go.Car parking is 6 euro per day which I think should be free for guest of the hotel.I did have evening meal in hotel on second night and found it quiet reasonable and served quickly.
The following morning I encountered many staff in the corridor area, however I found some of the who seemed to be working in an office on the corridor very unfriendly and not very customer focused.",3,2017,07,20
249,Quick stop convenience.,"Had a one night stay here recently with some good points and some distinctly average. First issue is parking.  Luckily we arrived early in the day and used the underground car park with no problem, however, I would be concerned if I couldn't get in here as the car park outside the hotel became excessively busy from mid afternoon, mainly lots of sportily clad people heading for the gym.  Anyhow, if you're taking a car, go early (also an extra charge for parking). Room was pretty decent, basic but with several well appreciated extras, such as extra pillows, electric fan on a stuffy humid day and big cushions which made sitting up in bed a lot more comfy.  Our room overlooked the car park which did get noisy sometimes but as it's a city hotel there was nothing unexpected here and it wasn't a big problem.  We had an early dinner in the bar and although our waiter was really nice he was very young and inexperienced, so service could have been better. Probably best to go later as kitchen and service didn't seem to be in full flow. Food was distinctly average, nothing obviously wrong with it, just seemed to lack freshness and definitely not noteworthy. This was our only meal as we were leaving extremely early the next morning.  Any staff we came into contact with were pleasant and helpful.  Overall a satisfactory stopover in a very busy location. Very good free wifi in the room. Served a purpose, but would have loved a really nice meal.",3,2017,07,20
249,Great hotel ,"I stayed here for 1 night on a work trip. Staff were lovely , my was room very clean & comfortable. Great breakfast in the morning . Hotel is just off the motorway and easy to get to dublin city centre from there. ",5,2017,07,20
249,Just a night out. ,"Stayed at the clarion with my wife, they upgrades us to a suite it was really good. Room was fantastic.  Staff were so nice and helpful.  Dinner in the restaurant was excellent. Breakfast the following morning topped off our visit with fresh fruit and what not.
 ",5,2017,07,19
249,Avoid booking on hotel website......,"This is a tale of two reviews......I booked 2 nights accommodation for my family (2 adults, 2 kids) at what I thought was a good price. On check in I was told my rate was higher..... When I queried this and took out my confirmation email there was a small line at the bottom adding ""estimated additional costs, taxes and charges""- which accounted for the extra charges (about €40). I have never seen this added before to Irish hotels and never an ESTIMATED cost. The girl on reception (Emma) seemed entirely unsympathetic and totally disinterested. When I requested to see a manager she told me the manager was in the toilet!! I insisted on seeing a manger and did speak to one shortly after- she was professional and polite, told me she couldn't understand the ""estimated"" part either and apologised, however had to charge the full amount. She stated that the parent company is Choice Hotels and they run the website so she had no control over it. But they were changing to Clayton hotels shortly and this would be resolved. But for now she could do nothing. NOT GOOD ENOUGH in my view. 

I was already very angry at this point, then they added on parking (€6per night) and wanted to charge my 2 year old for breakfast. Again when I queried that most hotels don't charge under 3's, then I was told that actually that was their policy too so I wasn't charged. I asked if there were any dinner deals in the restaurant - again I was told no, only after paying for our dinner seeing a poster in the lift offering meal deals that the restaurant or reception staff seemed to know nothing about. I would've left if I had a choice but given the time of year I knew finding an alternative would be difficult so we stayed. 

Next was the kids club.....my children enjoyed it thoroughly and the children's entertainer who does it is lovely. However she and a hotel staff member are the only staff. The doors were left open into a busy car park - I stayed to supervise my children as I was concerned about the safety aspect. I was right.....15 mins in -a 3 year old ran out on to the carpark and neither of the two staff even noticed. My husband ran out and caught her and brought her back in- I requested they close the safety door then. They didn't appear too concerned but phoned the child's mother to come and collect her. I was horrified by the whole incident. There are two safety doors which if used made the kids club perfectly safe and very enjoyable for the children. But it was clear the staff weren't used to being RESPONSIBLE for children. I raised this with the hotel staff also to prevent a serious incident.

Ok that was all the bad.....and it was pretty bad! That said I have to be honest and say those issues aside -the hotel was very nice (I begrudgingly say!!). Our family room was well equipped, food in the restaurant was good, and my children enjoyed the pool, playground and kids club. We were driving and the location was good. Liffey valley shopping centre across the road was also good. 

I expected at the start for this to be a seething review.....but I would have to say it is a good option for families, HOWEVER double check the pricing and hidden extras as we were caught out, also monitor safety of kids club.....go but be warned!!!",3,2017,07,19
249,Lovely food great location friendly mangement and staff,We spent last weekend in this lovely hotel celebrating a special birthday. The Manager Simon was so helpful and welcoming. The family rooms were nice and big (with their own kitchen and sitting room wifi was great!). We had a lovely dinner in the Asian restaurant on the Friday night and a fab meal in the Italian on Saturday where a lovely girl called Kayleigh couldn't do enough for us. Food and service were excellent. Adam was the same in the bar so nice and attentive. There was a great band playing in the bar and they were playing requests and even sang happy birthday to the birthday boy. We cant wait to go back and would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.,5,2017,07,18
249,First visit to Ireland,"This was my first visit to Ireland travelling with Shearing Coaches - The Hotel had obviously had a lot of money invested in it to present a lovely reception area/business facilities and two restaurants.  However, the bedrooms were really basic and as I was travelling with my daughter for a 4 night stay, five coat hangers between us were obviously not enough. The bathroom was very dated and the bath had a large chip in it which was rusty and the soap dish was hanging off the wall.  Its been a long time since I have used a shower with a shower curtain so flimsy it either stuck to you and let the water run down the side of the bath until it gathered in a large pool in the corner of the bathroom floor.

The breakfast was buffet style and was very nicely cooked, however, scrambled egg every morning did get a bit monotonous.  Each morning was a struggle to find a clean and cleared table, we just got the feeling the staff were harassed, albeit they were polite. We can only put the problems down to mismanagement by the Restaurant Manager.

Evening meal was equally as boring as breakfast.

Personally I would not wish to stay in this Hotel again.",3,2017,07,16
249,No Air Conditioning and No WIFI,"Summary - Rooms were much too warm and there was no WIFI signal in my room.

Stayed with a party of 10 in three rooms (2 family rooms and 1 double). The rooms were all the same size but the family rooms had two extra beds crammed in, making them much too small. I had to stand on one bed to close the curtains. The bedside lockers were tight against all the beds in the family rooms but the beds were different heights, so sleeping in a single bed was a danger if you happened to move your head during the night.

The heat in all three rooms was unbearable and there were no temperature controls. Opening a window or leaving the fan on were the only options to get some air, but a fan that sounded like a tractor and a room several hundred yards from a motorway meant we had little sleep the two nights we stayed.

I know most hotels don't provide full facilities for four people in a family room but this reached a new level for me. We had one chair, two cups and toiletries for one. Given that the bar excludes children after 10.00 pm and all the tables in the lobby were already occupied with bored looking families we had to go to the room and take turns sitting down and having tea. Because there was no WIFI the children entertained themselves by dividing the shower gel into four equal quantities to see if we would have enough to get washed.

We had dinner one evening and the service was terrible. The three-course meal took two and a half hours (by which time the children weren't allowed in the bar again). One person had their meal served after everyone else was finished and although more than half of the meals were of good quality this is not somewhere I would consider staying in or dining in again.
It might however suit families from warmer countries; who like living in cramped conditions; don't use the internet very much; are happy drinking tea from the same cups and often shower together!",1,2017,07,13
249,Pat,"I've had several meals in kudos bar/restaurant and I've found the service bad all 3 staff members on there phone and all times I've eaten there I've had to go to the bar to order my food,simply bad management,won't be going again.

249,"A decent, comfortable stay!","Stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting family in Dublin- room was on the ground floor, large rooms with plenty of space and lots of space to move around. Room came equipped with a safe, iron and an ironing board which was a bonus. Had access to the swimming facilities also which I did not utilise but definitely comes as a bonus. The hotel is close by to the shopping centre where there are plenty of places to eat and roam around and also not so far from Dublin airport. A comfortable stay in a great hotel.",5,2017,07,13
249,Amazing,"The hotel is at a great spot in Dublin as its only a five minute walking distance from Liffey Valley Shopping Center. Kids club is great, and fun.

249,Bad breakfast and questionable cleanliness,"We visited Dublin for 5 days and stayed in the Clarion Hotel. 
First impressions were overall good, the room was spacey, provided all needed amenities (TV, free Wi-fi, water cooker, iron etc). Also the price was good in comparison to other Dublin 4 Star hotels. We had rentals so the position of the hotel were good for us.
The problems started with our first breakfast, which was pretty pricey - 14,50 EUR/person. The food did not quite live up to this price and the bitter part came with what the hotel though coffee must be with a breakfast of that price - no espresso or any type of cappuccino is included, that one will cost you a extra of 3,50 EUR minimum and only if it is not Saturday or Sunday, at these days, the Cafe Machine that greets you at the front of the designated breakfast area is not operational.

Last part was that although the hotel provides room service, no body seems responsible for collecting the dirty dishes. At a certain point there were trays with dirty dishes all over the hallway and this made my every exit and entry to our room quite unpleasant.",3,2017,07,11
249,Complimentary Upgrade of Room,"Myself and my boyfriend came up here for a concert in Croke Park at the weekend and stayed here. It is a bit out of Dublin city centre itself but Liffey Vally Shopping Centre is fabulous. The actual hotel is brilliant, especially for kids! We had booked a twin room, so when we were checking in, I asked if there was any double rooms available. They upgraded us to a Superior Suite and when we asked for an hour late check out - I got my purse out to pay and the lady at reception but then she said this would be complimentary also. The staff are so so nice and friendly and the place is SPOTLESS. I would definitely come here again. Thanks so much, we loved our stay here!",5,2017,07,10
249,Pleasant stay,"Check in was smooth, room clean and tidy and the breakfast was great what more can I say. Only downfall was the vending machine you needed to use a credit card. Staff were nice enough also. The hotel has a two restaurants and a leisure centre",5,2017,07,08
249,Absolutely did the job,"Ideally located to have access to dublin, visited this location for two nights , family room for four was fine, kids club had movie night and a pool . Staff were fine even though hotel was busy. This hotel is very close to a shopping centre with lots of big names and restaurants. ",4,2017,07,07
249,over charged,"I had a nice stay, but there was extra money taken from my account.  It was meant to be sorted on checkout.  I rang the hotel 3 times and they said it would be refunded, I am still waiting 3 plus weeks now.  I don't think I should be making a 4th phone call.",1,2017,07,06
249,Ok,"I had read some quite bad reviews before we came so was a little worried. This hotel is ok. The positives are it's clean, the dinner in Gusto was lovely and it was a suitable base for a visit to Tayto park (about 25 minutes away). There were however some negatives to our stay. I had requested a cot for our baby before we arrived and had to ask a further two times when I arrived eventually getting the cot at 9pm when my baby usually goes to bed at 8pm. The rooms are also very hot but a fan was provided which helped a bit. The breakfast wasn't very good either. ",4,2017,07,04
249,Great break,"We had a two night break booked and it couldn't have gone better,the hotel was spotless,the room was lovely a bit of a walk from reception but I've come to expect that from family hotels and that's ok,the swimming pool and gym facilities were brilliant.
All the staff we met couldn't have been nicer and food was fabulous.we thought it was great value and we had a dinner and zoo tickets included in our package hoping to go back again next year.",5,2017,07,02
249,short holiday,"Our stay was great, made all the better for meeting Kevin and Sharon who made us feel very welcome.Great food in restaurant and for breakfast as well,nice room.Our first visit to Dublin and yes we will be back",4,2017,06,30
249,No Céad Míle Fáilte here!,"By far the worst reception I have experienced in any hotel Ive visited. The girls at reception were so unfriendly. Checked in Friday for one night 180euro  Breakfast 14euro extra per head. considering we are coffee and cereal people it was overpriced. Had a couple of encounters at resption requesting things and each time we were left standing there while they chatted amongst themselves for several or so minutes before looking up with an annoyed expression as in ""Why are you bothering us ?""... Very blunt and unhelpful. On checkout again we got the frosty reception. Simply asked our room number and took key. Nothing about how was our stay ? was everything ok ? Hope to see you all again. NOTHING ! The are very much in need of a training course in hospitality. I t would put you off going to them about making enquiries. I am unsure as to how some of these girls landed themselves a job welcoming guests because it seems to be an huge inconvenience to them. Staff at breakfast are quite friendly but I would imagine they were hired for the Summer as they all seemed quite young, but nonetheless a lot happier with their position! This was my third time visiting in the hotel, the last time I brought my two children and it was also unpleasant. I said id give it another go as the location was convenient but this is certainly the last time ill stay. The rooms are also terribly hot in the summer. They havent air con but do offer a fan that makes a loud mechanic sound through the night so it is a toss up of which you can bear the most. The sound of the motorway rivals the sound of the fan!",1,2017,06,27
249,Quiet spot away from the city center but only a short bus ride away.,"Check in and go for a walk in the area. You are minutes from a large mall, grocery stores and two different bus stops. The reasonably priced transit system can have you in the heart of Dublin in minutes for only a few euro's each way on a double-decker bus and you can see the sights along the way. If your suite has a fridge and you are on a budget why not walk to the grocery store just a couple blocks away and pick up some beverages or snacks for your stay. Large and comfortable suites offer a separate seating area away from those trying to nap. Watch out for the sometimes confusing halls and floors to find your room since it is not as you might think.",5,2017,06,25
249,First and last visit,"What an awful place to stay. Arrived on last Friday evening for one night. There were 5 reception staff and 3 other staff members behind the 3 reception desks, and they all ignored us as we stood there waiting to check in, despite our approaches and excuse me's, we were ignored. They seemed to be on a training exercise. We almost felt like walking out.
Eventually a lady said can I help you (like hello, we are not standing here for fun).
We had booked a superior double room which she told us was just a standard room so she had kindly given us an UPGRADE to an apartment, which wasn't in the hotel itself, you had to go outside to the back of the hotel to access the apartment, which was on the second floor. If this was an upgrade I really wouldn't want to see the superior double. On exiting the lift to our room the smell was horrendous. The door/glass was filthy, lift was filthy, and the carpet in hall and the apartment itself has not been hoovered for quite a while.
I feel sorry for the people who live in those apartments long term and there are quite a few. 
Appalling that they are allocating those apartments as an upgrade and I can safely say I will never return to this hotel. What a dump.
",1,2017,06,25
249,"Ok, but not value for money","Paid 180 Euros for B&B. The entrance is nice and modern. The check in was quite quick and the receptionist was friendly. You get free wifi and the speed is good. So far so good. 

I made my way to my room, it was a long walk. The room was ok, just like any other hotel. It is not air conditioned. It was very hot but they did have a floor standing fan in the room. It wasn't that spacious but adequate. It had twin beds and they were single beds so I was at risk of falling out of bed at night. Saying that, the bed was comfy as were the pillows.  

The breakfast was very good. The restaurant was quite busy but the staff were very good at clearing tables and turning it round and replenishing the food and drink. The food was nice. The orange juice wasn't that nice, a bit bitter but drinkable.

In summary, I would say that this is a mid range hotel, rooms may need modernising, for the price I don't think it is that good value. I am unlikely to return.",3,2017,06,23
249,Great location for a stop over ,"We needed a place that could get us to the airport quickly - this worked! Less than 15 minutes. Breakfast had lots of options as well. 

Our check in was relatively smooth. I booked two rooms through Expedia, but one of the rooms had been given away. They gave us two apartments beside each other for free (which was greatly appreciated!) 

The only downside was it's in a separate building from the hotel and the heat wave with no AC made the rooms unbearably hot. They gave us two fans which helped. Our rooms were also facing the motorway which was very very noisy. Since we needed two beds in one of the rooms, the bed was separated into two singles which worked but not as comfortable as the bed sizes we originally booked. 

Not the greatest sleep but I think that wasn't the hotel's fault.",3,2017,06,22
249,Sublime sleep,"Had the most comfortable sleep here, beds are spacious , bathroom is lovely and despite the unscenic surroundings, we had a lovely stay here.

The pool, steam room and sauna are all lovely and at 7.30 in the morning nice and quiet.

Breakfast had a good selection of fruit, yogurts, cold meats and cheeses as well as the cooked breakfast.
My only complaint was the scrambled eggs which had been microwaved.
Coffees outside the restaurant were absolutely delicious and the barista was charming.
All in all, a really good place to stay",4,2017,06,22
249,Dublin by bus,"Hotel situated approx 10miles from Dublin. We were in room 116 which was lower ground floor, really big double bed ,bathroom good size with shower over bath. No view but very quiet and curtains very effective light block. Being with a group evening meal either/ or on 1st two courses with dessert to follow. Breakfast serve yourself Buffett with everything you could really want. Staff friendly and helpful. Bus stop for Dublin 10mins walk away next to a shopping center.Also gym and swimming pool on site.",4,2017,06,22
249,Excellent adventure until Miss Trunchbull checked us out!!,"My family stayed here for 3 nights ending on June 21st. The hotel facilities were first class, the swimming pool provided an enjoyable experience for my two sons and the staff member Marty was excellent with the kids, very friendly. The room was spotless and the cleaning staff were very helpful and always spoke to us when walking along the corridors, although very disappointed the amount of corridors we had to trek down with 2 young kids to reach reception as our room was located at the back of the hotel. The breakfast was first class and was great value for money. Great Irish breakfast every morning with an extensive amount of food to pick from. Front of house each morning was different but all very friendly. I had planned on giving the hotel five stars but the final encounter when checking out ruined the perfect score. When checking out the front of house who was wearing a white shirt with red hair (spawn of chucky) was very blunt in asking me my room number and surname, once we got through the formalities of basic numbers she then decided to snatch the room keys from my hand totally unexpected, then very rudely and bluntly said a single bye. No question of how was your stay or was everything ok for you. Sad end to an almost perfect stay.",4,2017,06,21
249,Quality Hotel ,"Staying here tonight this hotel has excellent facilities . The health club with pool is great and stayed in suites large sitting room , tv , and own room big enough at rear with tv also.  Can not fault this place if I tried . AAAAA+ . Thank you Clarion for everything ",5,2017,06,18
249,Mrs,"I went to a function in this hotel last Tuesday. I have to say the service during the meal was atrocious. At dessert one person was left short and it took about 15 minutes to get attention to bring dessert. At tea and coffee time, cups were laid out at one end of the table for 10 leaving 5 people short. When this was brought to the attention of the waiter, after a long time, 1 cup was brought.  After another 10 minutes or so of trying to get attention, 1 more cup was brought and ""tea"". This tea had been lying in the pot since the original service. Was cold and impossible to say if it was tea or coffee. Disgraceful. On the plus side the room was lovely and music good
",2,2017,06,18
249,Pleasant Stacy,"We stayed here three nights and it was pleasant.  It's not the Ritz... but our room was clean and the staff was friendly.  The room was a bit warm (no ac but typical of area) but not horrible as they have a fan and window opened a little way.  There is some road noise, but it did not keep us up, depending on your light of a sleeper you are it's something to keep in mind.  Pool is a health-club that's attached to property, whirlpool is on the small side.  Breakfast offered a nice variety of options.",4,2017,06,15
249,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here on a business trip. At checkin I was upgraded to a suite, thank you very much. I had stayed here previously. The suite itself was great, spotless, and in a quiet location. Ate in the bar and the food and drinks were very tasty and reasonable. Staff were attentive and pleasant. Retired early and had a good nights sleep. The fans in the rooms were very welcome as the rooms were quite warm. Lunch the following day was good.
Overall, I was very happy with my stay here at this hotel. I would have no hesitation in returning. Thank you Clarion Hotel.",5,2017,06,11
249,Staff will let this hotel down,"Nice Hotel, spotlessly clean but the staff are only paid from the neck down just wandering around filling in their time until they clock off.
Without well trained, friendly, smiling staff, it's just another travel lodge.
It's a shame as the location is perfect, a short drive or bus ride to the city centre. A choice of restaurants, shops and a cinema within walking distance.
A family friendly hotel.
Bar:
What would appear to be a manager in the bar on Saturday night, because of his different attire, felt the need to molest the top of every glass he touched. Nobody's fingers/hands are that clean, then he either picked his nose or licked the beer off his fingers. Pulling pints should provide the same level of hygiene as serving food.",3,2017,06,11
249,Customer service poor,"Two rooms had been booked for a weekend trip to Dublin, one half of the party arrived earlier and checked into their room. However once we arrived we were told they hadn't paid. There was confusion by the receptionist and we were treat without care as if we were responsible delaying our check into the room. The woman did apologise once our friend brought her receipt to show she had paid. The rooms were furnished nicely however they were not cleaned once whilst we were there and I had to go to reception everytime I needed the more tea bags etc. Overall nice hotel decor etc but poorly run so would not return.",2,2017,06,10
249,"Great Value, great service, Nice rooms","Cant complain about this place, parking on site, not far from city centre, spa available (bring a swimming cap), indoor pool. We have received free upgrades a few times we stayed also. Went with friends, family and children and each time staff have been very accommodating each time.",4,2017,06,08
249,OK,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as its location suited us for the reason we were in Dublin. Its a hotel that I have driven past many times over the years and I often wondered what it was like.
The hotel from the outside is very unattractive. The car park is underground and very secure.
The room was ok but the housekeeping was sloppy. We mentioned this to a very pleasant receptionist called Bella who said she would pass on our comments.
The cooked breakfast was inedible-the ingredients appeared to be of a very poor quality. It was very busy and chaotic-I had to ask for cups,water,orange juice and milk. There was no fruit or yogurts at all.
The hotel is very worn and tired and needs a major overhaul-perhaps when it becomes a Clayton this will happen.",2,2017,06,08
249,Mini break,"Just home after staying in the clarion hotel. I had booked my room online through another agency and upon check-in was told there was no such booking under my name, which by The way I had paid for.  Now these things happen which is understandable, but The rudeness shown by The receptionist really took me by surprise, I mean it seems like a busy hotel and guests should not be treated in this way especially when I was The one having to wait to be checked in. Then upon checkout this morning another receptionist wanted to charge me again.  The bar and breakfast staff where so friendly and couldn't do enough for us but first impressions count I'm afraid. Overall The  hotel is nice and modern with a lovely swimming pool which the kids enjoyed, and very convenient to the liffey valley shopping centre, but there are plenty of nice modern hotels in dublin and I don't think I will be visiting this one again. ",2,2017,06,05
249,Visit first family break,Great hotel for short stay. Room was very clean and beds were v cummfy. We asked for a family room . Double n 2 singles.  If you were there any longer than one maybe 2 nights with kids youd want a bigger room.. staff were friendly. Got room service very quick and tasty got a pizza and wings .pizza was delicious. And the room service staff could bring card machiene to room if u dont have credit card registered to room.. it was great that there was a fridge in the room and as THE weather was exceptionaly hot they had put in a tall fan to help with the cooling of the room.kids zone inside was ok.. could do with few more bits maybe a kids slide . The playground was good and clean and modern pitty there was no steps to the slide for smaler kids that arent able to climb successfully.. breakfast was ok. Had to ask 4 a tray breakfast was buffet style plenty to.choose but tea and coffee was in hot flasks at the buffet but ur cup was on the table.   No cups beside the flasks . Had to ask 4 a tray to carry food down as there was none left out 4 customer use . Mad that you have to pay 6€ 4parking over 24 period  .,3,2017,06,01
249,Great Family Hotel,"I stayed here recently with my husband and young son (7 months). The staff were so accommodating, no problem getting a cot in the room. We got a great deal for B&B and dinner. In the morning we enjoyed the pool and leisure centre. Dinner and breakfast were very enjoyable. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,30
249,Could be excellent; let down by small things. ,"Stayed here with my wife for the weekend in Dublin; firstly this hotel is not in Dublin, it's either an expensive 20 minute taxi or a 40 minutes to an hour on a bus after a 15 minute walk. 

The room was very nice and comfortable; the bed was large and comfy. We had a separate area for dressing/ chilling out. 

The hotel is very big and caters to all from Families to business visitors. The issue that this has is that there are hundreds of rooms and guests but only one small reception with mostly only 1 member of staff. 

Check in is not until 3pm which is not ideal with the location being remote and the restaurants and bars in the hotel being very over priced. 
When booking we requested champagne in our room as it was for a birthday celebration but this was not done although we had conformation it would be. When we called to ask for it the receptionist said it would be on its way but an hour later we called again and told them to cancel it. 

Overall the hotel is good and clean with everything you need but they need to pay a bit more attention to guests and lower prices for food and drinks. ",4,2017,05,29
249,Impersonal,"stayed recently, room was clean and everything worked , beds comfortable however 
staff need to understand they are in the hospitality industry , ignored by receptionist on arrival , breakfast food fine staff non existent dirty tables and supervisor on entrance asked for room number and no other information forth coming . 
Management no presence, It would have been nice to have heard a good morning, welcome , hope you enjoy your stay",3,2017,05,29
249,"Large bedrooms, friendly staff ,good for airport","I was here for three days running some training courses and was very pleased with the help and support provided by all of the hotel and conference staff.
The bedrooms are very large and the beds very comfortable with good quality free Wi-Fi.
I was not able to connect my laptop to the TV in the bedroom as their HDMI connection did not work- but I can live with that.
It's very well placed for the airport with regular shuttle buses every 20 minutes and lots of car parking.
The breakfast in the morning are very comprehensive with a huge range of hot and cold foods, pretty much everything you could ever want.
Although everyday there were very long queues both for checkout and check-in which became quite annoying-.
People would commonly wait 20 minutes or more just to check in.",5,2017,05,27
249,Adequate,"Party of 10 stayed at the Clarion for two nights. Overall the staff were friendly and accommodating at check in. The rooms were adequate and clean, however although my room was fine, others in the party found there's to be too hot and could hear the gym instructor from the fitness centre doing a class at 6ish in the morning. Fans are provided in the rooms. I visited the spa on one occasion which was very busy with lots of children so I personally did not relax due to the noise level, apparently it was busy again the next day early morning. The spa staff were very friendly. We travelled into Dublin City by taxi which can get expensive if used more than once. There is a nice restaurant by the hotel which we used and the staff were lovely. There is also a shopping centre close by.",3,2017,05,26
249,A hotel in just the right place.,"When we fly to Ireland, we mostly utilize the airport in Dublin. We rent a car at the airport and have reservations at the Clarion Hotel in the Liffey Valley. The location of the hotel solves several problems for us. We have just completed the night flight from Boston to Dublin and we need a place in the immediate area to take a nap. I have just rented a car in a country that drives on the other side of the road than in the U.S and I have not driven on the other side since my last trip. So, I do not want to drive a great distance from the airport. I want to be in a good position for tomorrow morning to start off to County Galway. 
So, I can get on M-50 (highway) right outside of the airport and a short (15 minutes) drive will get me to the Clarion Hotel. The location of the Clarion Hotel is right next to N-4 which is the highway to Galway. Therefore the location is excellent !
The Hotel is a modern hotel with clean & well maintained rooms. The food is good, especially breakfast.  My stay is usually brief (one night) and I am off. I don't travel connected to the Internet so I don't know much about the hotel services. From the photos, the pool looks great !!
On the topic of airports. remember the the airport in Cork is a nice airport with rental car returns. We used the Cork Airport to get us to Paris which was very efficient for us to get to from Sneem in the Ring of Kerry.
Enjoy each Day !!",4,2017,05,24
249,"Promising, but let itself down in the end","On the face of it, this looked ideal for our stay over for business nearby. We arrived and were asked to re-locate to another hotel due to overbooking...when we refused and upgrade to a suite in the apartment block was offered, so again seemed great on the face of it.

We were impressed by the footprint of the suite, but we found it very tired and with limited facilities, no aircon, wifi that did not work....and sad as it may seem...basic 6 channels for TV.",3,2017,05,24
249,Weekend away,"My husbands birthday falls just after the new year and as such, is often relegated to the bottom of the new year pile of important things to do.
I decided to surprise him with a trip away.
I found an excellent deal on the choice hotels uk website. Two nights B&B, one evening meal and a €50 gift card for the neighbouring mall... for less that €200!
As it was such a great price, Dublin itself is generally quite pricey, I thought the out of town address of this hotel wouldn't matter.
Well, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again unless I was driving. It was a good 20 min walk from the bus stop and on our arrival evening it snowed over a foot in less than 2 hours. Thank goodness for the gift card, we nipped over to the mall and bought hats and gloves from primark (penneys). 
The hotel was nice enough, the room was basic and a long walk from reception.
Some places could do with a decorative tidy up. 
The shower was disappointing, but with a spa next door we coped.
Access to the spa (sauna, steam room, pool, gym) was complimentary but swim hats were required if swimming. They were not included, towels were.
Breakfast was a buffet style, our first morning was quite quiet and there was always a good stock of everything. The second morning it was very busy with Irish families visiting the city and we us to wait for a table, the food was being taken faster than it was topped up and I had to wait some time for a poached egg.
The staff were courteous and brisk in their work.
We had our included evening meal in the hotels 'italian' restaurant. It was tasty but obviously not freshly made. Microwaved I think.
There was a slight issue with the deal I had booked not showing up on their system, a quick google from their public pc and I printed off the required information. It seemed that the hotel was leaving choice hotel group and had not yet been removed from the main website. Thankfully for us, the manager agreed to honour the offer and so we had a lovey stay.  Although I'm unsure as to the outcome if I had been unable to replicate my booking because their system had no option for our deal.
Previous reviews I read before our visit mentioned noise on the evenings. As our room was at the furthest point possible from reception I can honestly say we had no issues with noise. Tho it might be more of a problem in rooms closer to reception and those with high footfall past their doors.

249,Fab one night stay,Went with my sister on a nights break. Staff Very friendly on arrival.  Check in was quick.  Room was spotless and comfortable.  Had booked a meal in Gusto's Resturant.  It was delicious.  Staff there friendly and food served quickly.    Check out was slow as only 2 staff on.,5,2017,05,14
249,Great hotel ,"Had a very good stay for a 5 day business trip. This busy hotel met all of our needs - good restaurants for breakfast and dinner, great fitness center, good spaces to work during the day, comfortable rooms and located near a shopping mall for work breaks. I'd highly recommend ",5,2017,05,13
249,"Fabulous hotel, stylish, caters for all ","Stayed here for 2 nights during the 'summer ' week. Weather was fab as was the few from my balcony. Room was brill; spacious, fresh, bright and very well equipped. One of the few locations where sleeping is easy due to perfect room temperature and lighting. Favourite memory was the added bonus of sitting on balcony watching the sun rise and set and enjoy the odd glimpse towards the hills in the distance. 
This hotel is fab for families, couples, business visits. It's large enough to cater for all yet offers a personal service (in my experience) normally done best by smaller businesses. Location is easy to navigate to and situated in the hub of shops, restaurants and cinemas too.",5,2017,05,13
249,"A good, clean, quality hotel","Liffey Valley is a busy, quality hotel situated about 6 miles outside the centre of town. If you need to stay in this part of town, then I have no problems whatsoever in recommending this hotel.
The staff are smart, friendly and efficient, the rooms are spacious and clean, the service is good and I enjoyed the breakfast and two restaurants. 
This is not a luxury hotel and I have to admit I did find the noise from the busy road next to the hotel a little disturbing, but I can say this, I would have no problem staying here again should I need to visit Dublin again.",4,2017,05,12
249,Amazing hotel!,"Booked this hotel via booking.com for a visit to Dublin in order to see a concert at the 3 arena on saturday 6th may 2017. flying in from heathrow we were due to arrive at midday even though the room wouldn't be ready until 3, so i called, being cheeky and asked if we could get in early. The receptionist kindly said she would try but due to a function she couldnt guarantee it, but upon our early arrival it was ready. 

even though i thought i had booked room only, i was told that breakfast was included and we were given a room on the lower floor. The room was brilliant. Huge bed, very nice decor, safe, table and chairs etc. The room even had an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was big with an amazing power shower. 

The hotel in general was big with several places to eat and the food was exceptional, with a gym, pool and coffee bar all available. Free wifi was a good added bonus. Staff were very helpful and friendly and the whole stay was very good. i would highly recommend to everyone.

PLEASE NOTE: if staying here and travelling from dublin airport, use ""airporthopper"" 9 euros per adult (7.20 if you prebook online) for a one way trip to or from the airport. highly recommended as we used it to get back to the airport and it was markedly cheaper than our initial transfer.",5,2017,05,08
249,Relaxing visit,"Recently stayed in this hotel with my kids. We didn't get to use the leisure facilities. Lovely hotel. Walking distance from shopping centre incl cinema, restaurants, coffee shops etc. Accessible from M50. Teapot didn't leak. Had curry for dinner in bar. Wanted non spicy food, but was really tasty, just what I wanted. Room on 1st floor. Not too far from reception. Staff v nice. Two single beds, one had single duvet, the other had double duvet. Duvets heavy but extra pillows in room. Blackout curtains. Free WiFi in room. Selection of stations in room. Room view of M50. Not noisy. Safe and mini fridge.",5,2017,05,08
249,Good hotel,"We had a 3 night stay at this hotel at the end of April. First impressions were very good. We parked in the car park beneath the hotel which, although is quite tight, was perfectly adequate. There is a 6 Euro charge to use the car park per day which we paid at reception when we checked in. 

I'd emailed the hotel prior to arriving to ask if an early check in was available and was told that they'd do their best. We arrived at 1pm and our room was ready, which we were delighted with. 

The room itself was possibly in the furthest area away from reception, but at least it kept us fit! We had a superior room which was very comfortable and spacious.

We had booked room only but arranged for breakfast on our first morning there. On a weekday, breakfast is served until 10am. We arrived just before 9 to find it really busy but found a table straight away. It's all self service, even the tea and coffee. We were really disappointed to find that there was hardly any cooked breakfast out. We thought maybe because it was busy that they'd run out and were replenishing but they only brought a few bits of bacon and sausage out at a time which rapidly went. There was only the choice of scrambled egg. There were no staff around to ask, which again was disappointing. There were other cold items such as tinned fruit, yoghurt and pastries. They also ran out of teabags! Again, no staff around to ask for more! For 15 Euros each, the breakfast was definitely not good value for money. We didn't bother with it for the rest of the stay.

We did eat in the Italian restaurant on 2 evenings and the experience couldn't have been any different from breakfast. Both times we hadn't booked and arrived fairly late after being out all day and we were accommodated straight away both times. The food was freshly cooked and lovely. The pizza in particular was really nice - you could actually watch it being cooked in the pizza oven. 

The receptionists are very good but we did experience long queues practically every time we needed them. I don't know if we just hit it at a busy time each time or if they are under staffed. The one major problem we had was that our key card had been programmed incorrectly so after 24 hours it locked us out of the room. After a full day out (on my birthday!) to come back to the hotel to find that we were locked out was not ideal to say the least. However, the receptionist (once we'd queued for about 10 minutes!) explained the issue and resolved it straight away to their credit. 

We didn't have chance to use the health club facilities unfortunately. 

All in all, we would stay here again and would recommend to others but I would not recommend breakfast.",4,2017,05,07
249,Great hotel ,"Thanks to the staff at the Clarion Liffey Valley, especially Nadine who made our first impression very good. She checked in my wife, 3 children and I and gave us lots of helpful information to make our stay unexpectedly great. Travelling with kids can be  stressful at times but with the warm welcome and friendly advice it set the tone for a great stay and we will definitely be back. Well done. Kevin McGee Donegal. ",5,2017,05,05
249,Was ok..ish,"Stayed here for one night with my kids as we where going to see a play, I've stayed here plenty of time with friends & with my partner, but my last experience wasn't very tasteful, I felt like one of the reception staff thought I was homeless & looking for a place to stay, felt like she was looking down her nose at us. (Maybe overreacting but it's who I felt) nevertheless wouldn't put me off staying again.",5,2017,05,04
249,Very nice hotel to visit,The hotel is very nice staff very courtious  only thing you need to brush up on is the breakfast very slow to get tea delivered to your table if you are in a hurry to get to work the next morning alot of staff but not keeping an eye on what is needed ,5,2017,05,04
249,Very good hotel,"After a bad experience, I moved to the Clarion and I was not disappointed.  Lovely room, great check in and great room service.  The hotel was busy but the staff coped with this very well and customer service did not fall. 
",4,2017,05,03
249,Dublin and naas,"Great hotel outside the city from the minute we walked in we was greeted with friendly and polite staff all willing to help at the drop of a hat the rooms we had was spacious and clean and the facilities was spotless the steam room was a great treat after a night out in dublin i wasnt very keen on 16euro for a standard breakfast but if you dont mind a 10minute walk there is a shopping centre up the road with lots of places to eat i chose mcdonalds and a pub on the front for breakfast and tgi friday for tea.
If you dont mind the walk i would recommend the bus just across the bridge by the shopping centre return only 7euro go by taxi anything from 60 to 75euro depends on your driver all in all great hotel and would recommend to anybody dublin as a city not a chance unless you dont mind being ripped off for being a tourist ",4,2017,05,01
249,Lovely hotel and staff ,"Lovely hotel! 
Arrived after midnight due to a late flight, man on reception was so friendly and funny, made to feel comfortable straight away! 
""Gorgeous George"" was also a hi light to our stay haha! (Security man) 
Room was beautiful and clean, comfortable bed, lovely big room. 
Handed our bags in on our last day to store for us and the lovely girl on the desk gave us advice on the quickest way into town on the bus, so friendly! Everyone we came into contact with whilst staying here were so friendly! Will deffo be back!! 
😊👌🏼",5,2017,05,01
249,Excellent experience!!,Really enjoyed our stay in the Clarion Hotel. The staff couldn't have been anymore helpful. The room was very comfortable with enough room for all of us. Great WiFi signal throughout the hotel and it is free of charge. The hotel have a wide range of food options for guests and a tasty wide range of breakfast options to fill up on.,5,2017,04,30
249,Loved it. ,Visited with my wife and son and another family. Great hotel clean comfortable and very child friendly. Kids had a great time in the pool and using the teen room although someone had kindly kept the Xbox stuff. Ate in the gusto restaurant and all thoroughly enjoyed our meals ranging from pizzas pasta and steaks. Will definitely be using this hotel again. ,5,2017,04,27
249,"Noisy, impolite, number","I have had to stay here for 6 years. There are constantly kids running up and down corridors at all hours that parents and staff are equally able to ignore.
Food has never changed on the menu in that time in the bar so a business traveller will go around the menu many times and is all the same style. 
The staff turnover is high and therefore you are never met by the same staff and they don't give a monkey as to who you are therefore you are just another number on the books. Not pleasant for a regular. I recently changed to the Aspect Hotel nearby, cheaper, more variety of food and fabulous staff.
The reason it gets a two at all is clean rooms.",2,2017,04,25
249,"No sleep what so ever,little girl and parents exhausted for an Irish Nationals event ","If it's sleep your after than this isn't the place to go,,we travelled the day before a big gymnastics event to relax and sleep before a very long ,exciting and nervous day for our daughter,we had a lovely evening in the restaurant, food was lovely staff were polite but getting a very important nights sleep was NOT to be had,childern up all hours and people talking all night ,we were woke 5/6 times,I even got dressed at 4 am and charged down to reception to complain,couldn't go back to sleep after that as the usual noise a hotel brings around 6 am with people leaving,,,complained to manager following morning looking for refund on room only(not food,food was good)only to be told no way I should have rang down to reception more often  to complain ,,HELLO,,obviously getting up and dressed going to reception at 4am,isn't enough,,Not happy,,",1,2017,04,24
249,Very short but impressive stay,"Myself and my Fiance stayed at this hotel as we simply needed a bed for the night as we had lots to do in Dublin the following morning. I booked the hotel only two nights before our planned arrival and thus got a very competitive price. The hotel is out beside the Liffey Valley shopping centre and is thus quite functional in its purpose. It's not close to town and public transport in is limited to the bus. For our purposes it was perfect as it was within striking distance of the M50 orbital motorway upon which we had to travel in the morning. 

We arrived late and were greeted by a very personable member of staff despite the late hour. The hotel was busy and the lobby was well maintained and clean. The bar area seemed lively which was a good sign. Our room was of a higher standard than we would have expected for the price. The bed was comfortable, there was a couch in the room, a decent TV and most importantly - a decent shower! All in all, very good for the price. 

We didn't have breakfast in the morning as we were on a budget so we were able to leave quickly in the morning. Part of the reason we got such a good price is that we paid in advance and did not chose breakfast. Also of note is that the car park is six euro for an overnight stay. High relative to the location of the hotel but the car park is underground and secure which makes a big difference. 

I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone with business in and around Dublin who has access to a car or is willing to pay for an expensive taxi if going to down. Hotel is handy but is not city centre!",5,2017,04,23
249,Great stay ,"Room was a great size and big comfy bed.  Breakfast was lovely too, had a nice meal in kudos one night then over to the Arc restaurant across the road, veggie options in all places. Pool facilities lovely and massage/treatments available. Cinema and liffey valley shopping centre very short walk away also. Staff were lovely, we got a Taxi from heuston which was 16 euro would def stay again.",4,2017,04,23
249,Great family hotel!,"Our first communication with the hotel was check in. My kids were totally taken with Bella who checked us in. She made the whole experience so special for them, explaining where the pool was and what time to come for breakfast. They insisted on letting her know about their every move after that. Thankfully she was so patient and very friendly, even remembering their names :) 
The room size was adequate and very clean. Beds were comfy and bathroom was spotless. There was a bit of a trek to the pool from our room so perhaps next time we would request a room a little closer.
The location of the hotel was spot on for proximity to Liffey Valley and access to the M50. 
Within the hotel the pool facilities was fantastic and clean and the little children's area on the ground floor was just what we needed. The barista at the coffee counter made unreal coffee and was also very kind to the little ones! 
My only minus point would be the absence of a family pizza deal which was advertised on Facebook and then ""not available during Easter holidays"" when we asked for it. Surely the Easter holidays would be the ideal time for a family deal? The restaurant food was just ok for what we paid for! 
Overall a lovely, family friendly hotel, we would definitely stay again. ",4,2017,04,23
249," Night away with the kids","Booked a last minute night away with the kids as the hotel had a pool. Pool was good, very busy because of easter holidays. There was a bit of a smell in the shower area on both days. Rooms were good with everything you needed even a little fridge. There was a good hairdryer in the room but no mirror nearby which you really do need when drying your hair. We ate in the Italian restaurant at night which was very nice, although we found the drink very expensive €6.95 for a cider. Maybe I am just not used to Dublin prices, stayed in Portlaoise last week and it was only €5.10 in a hotel. The hotel charges €6 for parking which I don't understand as it's their own private car park, really should be free for residents! Overall a good stay if you are getting a good deal. We paid £80 for a family of 4 room only and I think it was good value at that",3,2017,04,22
249,VERY STRESSFUL OVERNIGHT STAY FOR FAMILY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN,"My family stayed here on 17th April and had a horrendous experience, it was without doubt my worst stay in a hotel EVER. 
1. TRAVEL COT-On booking we requested a travel cot and were told that wasn't a problem and one would be in the room-none in room on arrival(5.15pm), we phoned to request one and were assured someone would put one in the room as soon as possible. We went back to the room after dinner at approx 7.30pm(refer to point 2 for complaint!) STILL NO TRAVEL COT. We called at reception AGAIN to request a travel cot only to be informed that 'unfortunately there was none available in the hotel' They reluctantly put a roll away bed in. Stress really began when trying to get kids to sleep, my little one has only ever slept in a cot and refused to sleep in a bed. After a very stressful period of time with 2 of my kids crying at this stage from exhaustion and unable to sleep I phoned reception to plead for them to locate a cot somewhere from within the hotel only to be informed AGAIN that there was no cot anywhere in the hotel but they could give us a roll away bed. Being at the end of my tether i informed reception that I was 5 minutes from checking out. I was told I would be phoned back in 2 minutes-which i was- and informed someone was on their way to the room with a travel cot!!! Baffled by the sudden turn up of the cot I asked the staff who brought it where it came from and they informed me it was in a room for another family who hadn't checked in yet--at 11.30 at night???? were they ever going to check in???? should we not have been given priority particularly after several requests???????
2.DINNER- food in the restaurant was okay, but then i'm going on reviews from the rest of the family because mine didn't come until everyone else was nearly finished theirs-very disappointing!!! ALSO, we had ordered side orders of chips with our meal, 2 extra portions of chips were given, when we informed a staff member we had been given extra(incase another table were waiting on them) they told us not to worry and to eat them-we didn't- but when settling the bill we were being charged for them!!!!!!!
3. BREAKFAST- There is a good spread of breakfast options. orange juice was running low, container had to be tipped to get the last drop! milk jug was refilled and had small black item floating on top of it. We went for breakfast at 8.30 and there was a few family's there but not an overly busy time. We had an approx 5 minute wait on breakfast bowls for cereal, I sorted the kids out with their breakfast cereal and went back up for mine only to find all the cereal bowls were gone again, opting out of another 5 minute wait for bowls I went for a fry and fancied a fried egg, so had to order one, I'm still waiting for it to come!!!!! 
4. THE SWIMMING POOL- kids loved it but not a life guard or staff member in sight, only at the door on entry-Health and safety risk??
5.THE CHECKOUT- Some of the above issues were relayed to the manager who did apologise and informed us that the hotel had run out of travel cots and had to go to another hotel to get some-may have been a plausible excuse only we had bumped into people we knew in the hotel and they had said they had a travel cot in their room all night that wasn't needed!!! so maybe we were told lies to cover up??? also, the sequence of events would indicate we were never getting a travel cot to begin with!!!! 
6. THE MANAGERS LIES- because of the horrendous experience we were offered a very small partial refund on our stay but guess what? to date we havent got it, not surprising!!!!! 
Take my advice, stay elsewhere, but unfortunately when you have a family of four kids trips away don't happen to often and sadly for my family this was their only getaway of the year, a precious memory? I think not, unsufferable flashbacks are more likely?!!!!",1,2017,04,21
249,Tayto park family visit,"Myself my husband and our 3 children  age 12 , 4 and 3 stayed here after a visit to tayto park really enjoyed our stay, clean , comfortale plenty of towels and toiletries plenty for the kids to do plus lots of tv channels to keep them occupied. Breakfast was tasty with plenty of variety we also had a quick swim in the pool which was lovely definitely would stay here again",4,2017,04,20
249,So impressed ,"Gusto restaurant absolutely beautiful.  Pizzas amazing, best we've ever had and I don't say that lightly!   Pasta dishes gorgeous.  I would eat here even if I wasn't staying here!  I just wish we lived closer, and the staff were so lovely.  I saw the manager giving off to the pizza chefs for some reason, totally unwarranted as our pizzas were the best ever.  And we are hard to please lol.",5,2017,04,19
249,Spectacular,"I can not say enough about my stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley as it was beyond stupendous! It began well before I even arrived in Ireland, with two phone call inquiries, spoke with manager Artur who displayed courtesy and patience giving me confidence that I chose the right hotel. When I arrived at the facility flying all night from the US at 6:30am of course my room was not ready but Artur gathered my luggage and stored it for me. He personally walked me the health center, and I was able to get in a great workout, swim and sauna. Soon after Hazel greeted me and made me aware that my room was ready and away I went. Wow the accommodations in this hotel were ""Lovely"". I also wanted to give a shout out to Noelle and Sarah from Sanovitae health and fitness center, this is a top notch facility and they made me feel right at home. Location is convenient to the shopping center, Dublin city and City West conference center where my daughters were competing in the Irish Dancing World championships. Hotel in my option gets a 10 out 10 in every category. I strongly recommend you stay here. Thanks for making my trip a precious memory. ~Tim",5,2017,04,17
249,Room not ready on check-in,We arrived at 6pm to check on for a 2 night stay to be told our room was not ready. Not ready at 6pm! No family rooms ready. We were offered complementary parking but that doesn't really help when everyone is tired after spending the day walking around the zoo. ,2,2017,04,17
249,Totally NON relaxing,"This hotel is like a zoo. It's really busy but they do not have enough staff to cater for this....if your busy get more staff!!!  Surely a hotel knows in advance if it is fully booked and that there is a conference on..??
We had to queue for min. 20mins to check in. I felt like I was checking in for a flight.
There was an empty desk at reception the whole time so they don't seem bothered by letting guests queue for so long.
If that wasn't bad enough when we got to reception we had to listen to a sales pitch about the restaurant,bar and breakfast. We didn't ask for any information about these and they are right next to the reception and hard to miss!
The bar was messy and kids everywhere..corridor is like a playground in the morning!!
Overall this hotel is too busy and badly run. Rooms are fine and clean so its a pity that downstairs is so chaotic.
Stay away if you want peace and quiet..!!",3,2017,04,15
249,Excellent ,"Lovely clean and tidy room, excellent food in the restaurants and bar. Good, clean swimming pool and in a good location. Would recommend to friends. This is a good choice for central Dublin as long as you have a car. ",5,2017,04,14
249,Perfect for Business and Leisure,"This is a great hotel. It's very busy but the team are extremely efficient. A very welcoming and professional team.
The rooms are comfortable and clean. 
On the outskirts of Dublin city but nice to get away from the hustle and bustle. A 15 minute drive to city centre or A short taxi ride. A short drive/taxi from the airport and good value for money.
Great menu in the bar and the restaurant with plenty of choice.
There's a gym and a pool too.
A 2 minute walk from Liffey Valley shopping centre which is open late most nights. Loads of shops and a food court with a separate area full of restaurants and a cinema too.",5,2017,04,12
249,Fabulous Hotel,"Lovely hotel with excellent service and it was real good value. Rooms were spotless, plenty of amenities on site at this hotel for everybody, couples groups or families. We had an evening meal in Gusto restaurant which was most enjoyable and reasonably priced. Airport Hoppa bus stops right outside the entrance here so if you don't want to take a taxi cab you can get back and forth from Dublin airport easily. Wasn't too far from Dublin town centre we aped about 30 euro in a cab between 4 of us. Breakfast was plentiful we paid for this on check in. Service n bar area was friendly too. All in all a lovely place to stay and one I would recommend to anybody and most definitely re-visit if we returned to Dublin.",5,2017,04,12
249,Busy but running smooth ,"Back in the Clarion liffey valley for a night. This hotel is busy as ever but well managed. I had a problem with noise coming from a room near by and reported this to reception, straight away I was moved and upgraded. Some guest sometimes don't realise that there are other people staying in the hotels that are not in holiday mode.
I find this hotel it's staff, service and food excellent. The hotel has family rooms,leisure centre and meal deals. The location of the hotel is fabulous just off the M4 and M50 with plenty of shops and restaurants in the near by shopping centre.

249,Great potential but just doesn't hit the 4 star rating,"Rooms were good size and bed was comfortable, but it was freezing.... Was probably warmer outside! No individual room temperature controls and radiator when it did come on, was behind curtain so heat was blocked from coming into room. No heater in bathroom. Check in was very slow and while the lady who checked me in was lovely, there seem to be a load of staff wandering around doing nothing while there was a massive queue at check in. Also to charge for parking in the location of the hotel seem to be a rip off, as surface parking seem to be free. To be me this hotel, fell well below its 4 star rating.",3,2017,04,09
249,Lies and dissapointed,"Dirty sheets with blood stains and yellow pillow cases.

Pillow cases changed bedsheets dabbed with type of cleaning solution and other stain tucked in to bed out of sight. Was told bed was changed completely. Showed them the pictures I took for record to prove they didn't change the bed as requested and they had no response but to say oh we didn't realize it was the duvet sheet bit yet they told me they would change the entire bed and that they checked the entire bedsheets for stains. Luckily I had the pictures to show them they lied to me and got caught out doing so!

Don't appreciate being lied to and attempted to cover up a bad attempt to rectify a bad situation !",1,2017,04,08
249,Family trip,"We were a family of 6, I checked in with my three daughters ,5,3 and 1. A double buggy and bags. Not once did I get asked did I need any help or help with my bags. Seems like a basic hotel greeting.
The hotel reception staff overall not very friendly. The breakfast was average, buffet not very appealing. Not very many breakfast staff. 
The pool was great, kids area perfect so overall we got what we asked for. Just wished our experience was a bit more cheerful",3,2017,04,04
249,Well Located Hotel,Stayed at this hotel while on business. Not disappointed. Nice welcome at reception and a comfortable room with good mattress and towels. It would be nice to have water in room and a chair. I'm not into shower curtains!! Great food in lounge bar. Good selection and well priced. Free internet. Will stay again. Thank you.,4,2017,04,04
249,Wowcher Deal,"Stayed here for 2 nights through a Wowcher deal which had upgraded us from a 3* hotel to this, 4* hotel. Rang a few days before to check we could drop airport luggage off before check in, and the receptionist was lovely and said this was fine. Stayed for 2 nights, the first of which we ate in the hotel restaurant. Unfortunately only the Asian menu was available, so we had spicy beef & rice- which wasn't very spicy at all but was a nice meal regardless. Breakfast each day was worth the extra £5 per person, buffet style with everything you could think of! Really set us up for the day well. Staff were friendly and on our first day the lady who took our luggage was very helpful in giving us directions to the bus stop. The hotel is about 10 minutes drive (minus traffic) out of the city center but there are regular buses from a stop 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Buses are every 15 minutes & stop at all the main places. Overall a lovely stay, bed was so big and comfy too!",3,2017,04,04
249,Rip Off and poor customer service,"If your willing to pay 6 euro a night parking on top of your already decently priced room stay and ridiclious €14.50 for a basic buffett breakfast then this is the place for you. 
Upon arrival the receptionist was vague non informative and failed to mention important details that we were to find out at a later stage which was major inconvience.
The hotel itself is very clean neat and rooms basic but well presented so I cannot fault that part.
Unfortunatly I will not be returning
",2,2017,04,02
249,Good meeting room facilities - let down by poor lunch facilities in a self service Kudos area,"Very helpful reception and banqueting staff. Good meetings rooms. Changing cups and glasses at lunch breaks was a bit hit and miss, but the staff could not have been more helpful. A good meeting venue.
Alas, the Kudos area lets the hotel down.
Really basic and a bit chaotic soup and sandwich queue-up and watch the inefficiency (and wait!). The range of choices for a ""Kudos"" was another let down, particularly when compared to the Santry Clarion.",3,2017,04,01
249,Wonderful ,"We stayed in a suite here for one night , it really was something , spotlessly clean , so spacious , sliding doors onto a balcony to watch the busy M50 swamped with traffic , room is sound proofed, stone throw from Liffey valley & perfect gateway to Dublin airport an easy 100%",5,2017,03,30
249,Ok for a one night stay,"Booked a twin room but was allocated a double.  When I went to reception to request the room I had booked I was firstly told I was wrong and had booked the wrong room (email confirmation showed 2 single beds) and then that I must have booked through a third party website as there's always problems with that (email confirmation showed direct booking). No apology and on re-assignment only one key card was updated.  Charged €6 for parking even though there is no mention of this at time of booking and I have since gone back to the website and can find no mention of this hidden charge.
Room was adequate.  Shower was powerful and a good temperature.  Bed was very comfortable.
Had food from the limited bar menu.  Ordered a wrap with a side of chips.  Had eaten the chips by the time the wrap arrived.  Waited at the bar while the barmaid looked at me three times before deciding to serve me (I was the only one at the bar at the time).
The hotel was fine as a one night stopover and I can't argue with the price but customer service needs a serious review.

249,2night stay,I stayed in the clarion the first night with the intention just to stay one night for a weddings but I came down with a bad flue.I was so impressed with everything the staff were so helpful and friendly and went beyond there jobs to help me out there was a man named Manny (Emanuel who was especially helpful my phone had run out of battery he went out of he's way to find me a charger I was so grateful I was in pain and couldn't contact anyone. so on both days I found the staff a real pleasure to deal with both rooms were spotless and light and modern my 13year old son stayed with me the second  night and there was plenty to keep him entertained. by far my favourite hotel so far we will definitely be stays there age an thanks guysxx,4,2017,03,27
249,Lovely Stay,Had a lovely stay over in a family room in this very appealing 4 star hotel. Friendly fast check in. My only reason for not giving a 5 is the shower curtain was a bit dirty and I have a personal hate of these anyway. All up would certainly recommend to stay here. ,4,2017,03,26
249,Business Trip,"Great location, great room. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the food and Italian restaurant ! !
Food dreadful, having waited 45 mins for my meal so not terribly happy. A second attempt wasn't much better - worst gluten free pizza ever !!! What was even more frustrating was not then being able to use the facilities and have a swim as by the time I finally finished my meal it was too late !
Didn't get charged for the meal but I should think not ! 
Breakfast felt like I was in the middle of a nightclub. the music was so loud and completely unsuitable for morning ! Please consider your guests rather than what the staff may want to listen to. 
So not the greatest of experiences and suspect I won't be going back there as a result which is a pity, as the hotel itself was pretty good.",3,2017,03,23
249,Comfort that's light on the pocket,"Have stayed here on numerous occasions. Perfect for West/North West traffic. Not well covered with public transport so you will need a car to get into city centre or further afield. 
Excellent family rooms, restaurant food available until 10pm in bar (Kudos) and decent wine list. 
Liffey Valley shopping & cinema are just a stroll away. Ideal location for family breaks if taking in Dublin Zoo/Tayto Park/site seeing but you will need that car.
Price is always reasonable, even last minute. Booking room rate only can be as low as €49 mid-week.
I have done cheap & cheerful, luxury apartment and adjoining family rooms here over the years and never had a single complaint. 
Not my ideal for a romantic break would be my only, slight, negative.",4,2017,03,22
249,Good stay!,"Great hotel, rooms were very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Prices for the room were reasonable, is a while from town but on the bus it's fine. Only negative is that there was a lot of noise early in the morning from children ",4,2017,03,22
249,Suited our needs,"Stayed in this hotel over St. Patrick's weekend! It's not a central hotel so don't book if you're looking for a city centre location - however we got leap cards from the newsagents in the shopping centre topped them up €20 and it lasted the whole weekend. The buses are very regular! Only problem is the night bus doesn't announce the stops...we accidentally ended up a 35 minute walk away from our hotel at 3am - not ideal! The hotel itself is lovely, unfortunately we didn't find the time to use the facilities. Beds were comfortable and rooms clean. First night we arrived late from the airport (€45 taxi) it was extremely noisy, however the noise at night didn't bother us any other evening as we joined in on making it. Screaming children running up and down the corridors at 8.00am however did bother us - though worked as an alarm clock and it's more the fault of the parents than the hotels. We had breakfast one morning in the hotel, great value for money it was all super hot and of fantastic quality! Even made me poached eggs to order - the best I've ever had. Would probably stay in a more central location on my next visit! ",4,2017,03,22
249,sbeakily charged for prepaid room,"beware this hotel, treated with disdain and double charged for room despite being assured were swiping my card as a back up and that the corporate room was sorted when i asked before leaving, they pre authorised 2 payments and took one when it had been paid for by my company, customer service terrible as i am trying to sort the refund i am entitled too, very disrespectful, unclear information, no call back when promised then a hasty voicemail claiming they had no details of booking and were on annual leave-",2,2017,03,18
249,Great hotel but take a cab to get there  - bus is too long!,"We arrived at Heuston Station. I called ahead of time and asked if I should take a cab to the hotel. The gentlemen said it would be too expensive and said to take the 40 bus. DON'T DO IT!  It took almost 2 hours when a cab is about a 15 min ride and well worth the extra money. When we arrived, we were in a hurry to make a scheduled tour. The young lady at reception, Payal was extremely helped and pleasant. She quickly checked us in and arranged for a taxi back into Dublin. She saved the day!  The rooms are very clean, beds are very comfortable and the windows open for a cool breeze. Great rooms for families. The food is really good as well. Hazel assisted me at check out and was also very helpful. We will definitely stay here again. ",4,2017,03,18
249,Excellent value,"We only stayed at the Clarion for one night, but it was a comfortable stay. Our room was very clean and nicely appointed and the rate included a breakfast buffet. The hotel is closer to the airport, so you're on the outskirts of Dublin. However, there's a bus that's about a 20 minute walk away that takes you into town.",4,2017,03,18
249,very family friendly,"stayed here with two year old. they have a nice little park on site be prepared to lift your toddler onto the slide each time though the climbing part not for someone so small but apart from that great facility,  swimming pool was excellent nice warm for our fairy and they provided towels. staff were very friendly lady on reception was very very nice and helpful gave us tickets for car park so we could go in and out during the day without having to get our car park ticket done at reception each time and also gave us a late check out without any drama so our wee one could get a nap in before we headed off. play area on one of the floors also nice for small kids. ate in hotel for dinner food was fine not grand dining but big portions and a nice kids menu where you could actually got potatoes for child not just usual chips menu.free wifi in hotel so happy hubbie. tea coffee in room with toiletries in bathroom nice room  big comfy bed and travel cot with enough room to run around. one negative about hotel is that elevator seems to leave you off good distance from room so if your not lugging your buggy in and out of the car or you had elderly person with you, would need room nearer to either reception or an elevator we had two corridors to go after elevator just some thing but worth bearing in mind if booking. overall enjoyed our stay just few min away from liffey valley shopping centre. as another commentor said the parking is 6euro a night but its underground parking nice access to hotel bit expensive if staying more than one night i guess but go park in liffey valley for free??",5,2017,03,16
249,Ireland-summer 2016,"This is a very busy hotel that is located off a highway(outskirts of Dublin). Many Tourist buses use this hotel. The room was quiet and clean. it has the basic amenities. 
we left our rental car in the parking lot and took the bus to Dublin. It is long walk from the hotel to the nearest bus stop. The parking is free if you are staying at the Hotel.",3,2017,03,15
249,"Superb value, comfortable family overnight","An overnight stop prior to a flight from Dublin airport - excellent value DBB rate found on the Clarion website. Room was good for families as it contained comfortable double & 2 single beds (real ones - not sofa beds = happy rested kids!). Dinner was really good and served with a smile. Breakfast was a bit manic but that was due to the number of people who were staying - tables need to be cleared faster... 

Some confusion over the dinner bill at check out - quickly and efficiently sorted. Overall a much better experience vs a previous visit around 4 yrs ago and one we will repeat.",5,2017,03,13
249,Shar,"We went to stay for the weekend . Very pleasant . Was extremely busy on Saturday due to having a function . You have the choice of the restaurant and eating in the bar . Both were ok . Nothing fantastic . Think they were very short staffed as the tables were never cleared unless they got more people coming in. So poor show. Breakfast was good.  We stayed on the ground floor . Our room was fine on the Saturday night . On Sunday different story . We had neighbours and the rooms had doors going through to the next room . Guessing if a family was staying it would be convenient. The walls  are really thin and bad luck on our part . Our neighbours didn't consider there neighbours at all . Television blaring really loud and infact  most of night kept us awake until early hours . My husband did go and ask if they could lower the volume , which they did but could still here it until early hours . Then there was more noise , not pleasant to listen to. On leaving we did approach reception and they apologised . Didn't feel like going to reception early hours complaining . They said we should have .  My advice any noisy neighbours make the staff aware !!  Also you may need a car . Although parking is expensive ! Buses are available , but a bit of a walk ! Although the shuttle bus is good to the airport . Which we didn't know about on our arrival .",3,2017,03,13
249,So disappointing,"I stayed here saturday night with 2 friends. Room wasnt too bad.  But beware the extras. All  three of us drove seperately and stayed overnight but each of us had to pay for parking  we had paid for food, hotel accommodation and drinks and then parking too. Not only that but we were charged €13.50 for breakfast too!  A very underwhelming breakfast  considering the price.  I left my car lights on and had no jumpleads. The male receptionist was uninterested, unhelpful and rude. This place lacks polish, professionalism and warmth. Really disappointing and will  never go back. Theres a lot better hotels that are cheaper, are in nicer locations and have more pleasant staff. NEVER AGAIN!!",1,2017,03,12
249,Ideal for a shopping break,"I have stayed in this hotel several times for both work and leisure, most recently in September 2016 for a weekend shopping break. 
If I am not intending to visit Dubin city centre this I find this hotel ideally located.  That said, Dublin city centre is only a short car or bus journey away.  Liffey Valley shopping centre is a short walk from this hotel, it has lots of shops, restaurants and a cinema so has plenty to offer if the it's a typically Irish rainy day!
The rooms are clean and functional and I would recommend asking for a quiet room if you are (like me) a light sleeper as traffic noise may be a problem.  I did not eat in the hotel on this particular stay but only because we ate while we were in the shopping centre.",4,2017,03,12
249,Weekend break in Dublin,"Good hotel, clean and comfy. Good standards. Location isn't the best, 10 min walk to nearest bus stop, then at least 20-25 min to get into city centre. Coming back is a nightmare- took  60min due to traffic, also bus is going all around the liffey valley. Will recommend using taxis instead it's around 20-25 euros (also at night). Hotel staff nice and helpful. Single beds quite small but apart from this rooms in good standards.",5,2017,03,08
249,Overnight stay,"Fabulous hotel great location for Liggy valley shopping centre. Very convenient, as just off the m50 . Rooms were of a great standard. Breakfast was very good , plenty of variety.  Staff very welcoming. ",5,2017,03,07
249,Clarion hotel,"Good hotel, comfy mattresses. Shower was strong. The breakfast food was not great. Internet was spotty. Girls at reception were very nice. The kind mister from the bar Jack took good care of us. Good place",4,2017,03,07
249,One night stay with friends. ,"Good shopping at Liffey Valley Centre, 5 minutes walk away. Clean, spacious,  comfortable room. Noisy on corridor outside room, not hotel's fault, some guests having no consideration for others.
Ate in the Kudos bar, food good but plates cold so food went cold quickly. Server was very friendly and helpful. Bar didn't stock many of the drinks our party usually have but had some nice wine, well priced at €6 per glass. We thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment provided by music duo 'Upbeat'. Would stay again. ",4,2017,03,05
249,Unruly parents ignored child,"Had a business meeting in lobby of Clarion and had to move to main bar area as there was a young family with a crying child 
We were only set up again when the couple and child came into bar area and the child continued to scream and be upset whilst her parents ignored her!
We had to leave as we could not hear ourselves think!
Another couple left too.
I have reared 3 children of my own and I do not understand how some parents absolve themselves of their responsibilities 
Paying guests and patrons too should be able to enjoy their experience at the hotel 
In fairness to the hotel the staff were friendly and attentive to us and the venue was very clean and bright 
I felt sorry for the staff 
 ",4,2017,03,04
249,Happy Out 5,"We stayed for 3 nights (17th,18th & 19th February). As always everything was fantastic, room very clean and comfy, food top class, staff especially reception were very very helpful. Had a fantastic Massage in the leisure centre downstairs.Terrific value for money. Will be back soon.",5,2017,03,03
249,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed in a one bedroom suite and I found the hotel to be extremely friendly, clean , tidy safe, secure and overall excellent stay! The buffet breakfast was the best I had in Ireland and the Arc bar next door was great for dinner, also has some excellent room service. Close to the shopping centre and close to the city, highly recommend would stay again if ever in Ireland",4,2017,03,02
249,Girls weekend,"Was a lovely hotel room was spotless the staff were excellent couldn't do enough for us from the check in staff to the restaurant staff to the cleaners lovely restaurants we ate in both food was lovely in both . The only downside was how noisy the ppl were above us but that's not really anything to do with the staff ,was lovely to see the management so involved and they were also very attentive ,looking forward to going back but I would ask for the top floor .",4,2017,02,26
249,Good Location,Recently stayed in Clarion for one night as had appointment nearby --- Staff helpful on check in and for dinner but cant say same for breakfast staff -- or for the food at breakfast -- not what you would expect in 4 star hotel -- hot food was dried out even at 8.30 in the morning. Dinner was lovely as was accommodation --- 30 euro for breakfast way too much  -- especially for what was on offer == also 6 euro a night to park ---,3,2017,02,25
249,Bookings,I booked this hotel through booking.com for two nights for the family. Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances we could only stay one night so we checked out at 11am after staying one night. The contract with booking.com states that there can be no refunds if you decide to change the booking within 24 hrs of your arrival. I asked the hotel could they refund me for the second night and they said i would have to go through booking.com to do this. I therefore did this after being told payment had already taken place through booking.com. Further to this booking.com informed me that they tried to negotiate with this hotel but the hotel was having none of it. They said i had entered into a contract and that was it. A good hotel but don't book through booking.com.,3,2017,02,22
249,Great hotel...,"I stayed here for one night with my partner, and the hotel was very practical and has a great location. The staff were very friendly, and the room was extremely spacious and clean. The bed was a great size, and there is also a nice bar downstairs, where we had a couple of drinks. There is also a very nice restaurant, but we didn't go there. Dublin city centre is 20-30 minutes away in a taxi, and Liffey Valley shopping centre is a five minute walk away, so you really are spoilt for choice!
If I had the opportunity, I would stay here again!",5,2017,02,20
249,Good hotel and close to a mall!,"Stayed here during a layover and visited the mall for a movie and cheap eats. Good location, walking distance from things to do. Mid-level hotel with adequate internet speed and guest service. I wish I couldve stayed longer to see what Dublin has to offer.",4,2017,02,19
249,Comfortable but noisy,"Had a comfortable one night stay the room was nice and the bed excellent. The hotel was a little noisy though seemed to be full of very young children. 
Breakfast was a little disappointing with luck warm food and watered down orange juice. I was also seated at a table already being used plus a waitress then leaned across me to try and reset the far side of the table while I was sat eating!
The €6 car park charge rather offsets what would have been a good value stay.
It won't be my first choice in future but I won't rule it out either.",3,2017,02,19
249,Vist,"Had a lovely 2 night stay at the Clarion Hotel liffey Valley, The hotel staff are very friendly and family oriented, and the rooms are lovely clean and spacious, comfortable prices are very reasonable and the bars staff are very helpful and friendly. two members of staff that stood out to my husband and I were Kayleigh and Brendan I would recommend this hotel it is central to liffey Valley shopping centre and bus routes to dublin city centre ",4,2017,02,18
249,Great hotel,"Great hotel. Unbelievable staff very helpful, understanding and professional. Especially receptionist Martina. Couldn't meet nicer.! Did her best to make sure our stay at the hotel was most enjoyable. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
THANK YOU,
MARTINA.",5,2017,02,17
249,ideal hotel.,"This was a lovely place to stay, it was quiet, clean, very accommodating, helpful and great value for money.  Its a short ride away from dublin centre, however buses are easilly accessible and there are local shops and ammenities.",5,2017,02,16
249,Always a nice stay ,"I've recently returned form a short stay @ the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley, it's not my 1st stay & wont be my last. 
Always nice to stay, staff are always attentive and the rooms/beds are very spacious. 
It's about 15miles outside of Dublin but great access with the motorway 2mins away. ",4,2017,02,14
249,One night in Dublin,"The hotel is spotless and the rooms are sizy and clean. The front desk staff are a bit clueless and overwhelmed. They were both very young and slow - in terms of speed. I did ask for a cit centre map, like the ones you find everywhere. We only got different companies maps, like the bus map etc. Small annoyance. 
The hotel bar was okay. Does what its supposed to. Cheap wine and nuts. The location is about 20 minutes outside the city centre, not a problem as there is a bus stop outside, about 10 min walk both ways. Walk to a black bridge, cross over and there you go. Very important....you MUST have the correct change for the bus otherwise you can't get on. We had to walk to the mall after finding this out. Everyone is super friendly in Dublin and the city centre is quite cool. Festive atmosphere and narrow cobbled laines with Irish music blaring from every pub. Cool visit.",3,2017,02,14
249,Great access to shopping at liffey valley and cinema complex,"I had a lovely stay at the Clarion.  It was very comfortable with a nice clean room.  The staff were very friendly and the bar food was good.  A nice atmosphere especially for families.  The breakfast was acceptable but the buffet was a bit too busy to really relax and the food was cooked in bulk.  Overall, I would go back again.",3,2017,02,14
249,Good Hotel,Very comfortable beds with great bathroom. Quick checkin. Great staff and not far from great shopping. Conference and training facilities are high class. The food was great too. Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to prospective visitors.,5,2017,02,13
249,"Good room, a few disappointments","Stayed here on Saturday evening for a gala at NAC. On arrival receptionist was a lovely girl,  very pleasant. Room was clean,  large and beds very comfortable.  Ordered room service which was prompt. Food was generally good however beware of chicken wings with celery and cucumber sticks....only 1 piece of celery and cucumber...more of a garnish than part of the dish. A lot of noise outside the room,  noisy people banging on doors, shouting etc. Bathroom was fine,  good selection of toiletries although the conditioning shampoo definitely is not conditioning!  Breakfast was awful....hot food wasn't replenished and what was available was freezing. I didn't complain however discovered later others had and been refunded. I phoned to enquire about getting breakfast that morning and very short man put phone down mid conversation.  I paid for the car parking ticket when I paid for my room then when leaving the car park couldn't get out...said I had to pay! No one answered the help button. I had to call reception externally as had 2 young girls in car. Said they would send manager and again put the phone down on me...same man as before...shocking!  Manager eventually arrived to question me on my ticket...not my issue although felt they thought it was. Mostly hotel was good but very average service and awful breakfast. We normally stay at Premier Inn close by and think I would rather return there as I just didn't feel the service or breakfast was up to scratch. ",3,2017,02,12
249,Family Night away after a show,"Number One on a night away is a good nights sleep.  The beds, supportive, and comfortable, all four of us awoke refreshed and energised.  The usual organised chaos at breakfast was eased by very helpful staff which makes any hotel visit enjoyable.  Standout's for me at breakfast was the pudding and fresh fruit salad, the let down was the scrambled eggs, bland and tasteless.  We ate in the Gusto restaurant the previous night.  Reasonably priced pizzas went down a treat.  Very tasty.  All in all, we would all love to return.",5,2017,02,12
249,Awful,"Busy, noisy hotel. Hard to find parking space. Couldn't get anything to eat as we'd arrived at 10-20 and they'd stopped serving food at 10-00 so evening meal consisted of a packet of dorritos from the vending machine. Could hear everyone walking down corridor. Our room had 2 adjoining doors which meant that we could hear the group next door as the talked all night long/ it's 06.44 now and they're still talking. The unasked for adjoining rooms also meant that we could smell every cigarette they lit, really unpleasant. Can't wait to check out and leave, will not be returning",1,2017,02,12
249,Comfy,"The Clarion was a nice modern comfortable hotel. 

The room was really spacious and comfortable. We also had room service for dinner. which was very quick and tasty.

If your looking for somewhere Comfy for the night this is the spot",3,2017,02,11
249,"Good location and hotel, average staff","The location is good,  the hotel is nice, however breakfast and reception staff let the hotel down.

Our room was very good, quite a distance from main reception but a large room and very nice, our breakfast experience was awful. On the second morning I had a word with reception staff whom said and did nothing.

Service in this industry is key, we wouldn't stay again sadly",3,2017,02,09
249,"Nice Hotel But, Not Great Location","We really enjoyed our stay once we settled in. We were on honeymoon and I n arrival they told us they'd upgraded us. They gave us directions to an outside block containing apartments. We entered into what I can only distribute as a cold empty worn out flat. I returned to the hotel to tell them it wasn't suitable and a bit of a walk for my wife who has a bad hip so, instead they reluctantly gave us a room in the hotel which was a longer walk than the previous accommodation?
It was a nice clean room and we enjoyed our stay and we loved the Italian restaurant in the hotel. I was however cheesed off when the nice music was replaced one evening by the noisy football match. The bar wasn't that busy but, they insisted on pipping the sound of the football throughout the whole bar. Breakfast was good but the tables were left in a mess and not cleared.
The hotel isn't in a great location for visiting Dublin and a taxi to the centre will cost you between 25/30€",3,2017,02,05
249,Very relaxing weekend at Clarion,"My most recent stay at Clarion Liffey Valley was very relaxing and enjoyable.  Food was excellent and room was very quiet, clean and comfortable. Excellent staff who made my two night stay even more enjoyable",5,2017,02,05
249,Very busy weekend stay!,"We stayed here with our 3 yr old daughter for a weekend when we were attending Disney on Ice. Alot of other families had the same idea so the hotel was very busy. Checking in was fine for us we got lucky because most of the time the queue was out the door. The room was great spacious, clean, great tea tray and beds were really comfy. Everything we needed was there including fridge which was so handy. The bathroom was nice, bright and spotless. A few cons were the noise in the corridors you could hear every person that passed the door. The queues for breakfast the 1st morning were ridiculous we ended up being brought to the other restaurant where they started setting up a make shift breakfast buffet there was very little, no variety basically a big let down. That night a notice went up saying when busy breakfast times were so we went early to avoid the previous mornings disaster. The lady asked had we prepaid for breakfast (which we had) as we were not on the list. She said go on in and she would check when she could. We went in got our breakfast and were sitting down eating when I notice herself and another staff member staring at us talking going through the list. This went on for quite a few minutes. We felt very uncomfortable. When leaving I asked had she found us and there wasn't even an apology. The breakfast was nothing special (fry was fine but tiny croissants and little fruit selection) for the price we paid compared to other hotels. I wish we hadn't prepaid as I wouldn't have went back the second morning. We had to pay for our 3yr olds who would eat a sausage and toast. We travel a lot and have never had to pay for hers. The hotel should have been prepared for breakfast seeing as they knew how many people were booked in. Again the queue to check out was out the door. On a normal weekend I would hope this hotel is more organised because we really liked the room, location and facilities if they were we would return.",3,2017,02,04
249,Enjoyed our visit,"Stayed at this hotel for the third time in December. Once again, could not fault it.  Lovely clean rooms with the added bonus of a fridge.  Ate at the Bar on the Saturday night and the food was beautiful.  Entertained by the brilliant Tropical Storm (again).  We were asked to leave the bar after closing time as we had our daughter with us but had a drink in the lobby and the atmosphere was great.  Noticed a girl had a trip on the stairs and the staff were straight on to it.  Beautiful swimming pool and changing rooms.  very clean.  Very good value for money hotel.  Would definitely stay again.",4,2017,02,03
249,Great location,Stayed here for the weekend was attending a concert in the national concert hall.. buses are very frequent to town..which was great saved a fortune no  taxi's..hotel staff all so friendly.came back late after our night out had a drink in the bar. Once again staff were very nice..hotel room was lovely and the bed so comfortable very clean also..am planning on a return visit as we really enjoyed our stay.and was so handy getting the bus into town on both nights ,4,2017,02,01
249,Sleepless night with scared kids!,"This was my fourth stay at clarion liffey valley as we had always enjoyed our family breaks here...however this time was a nightmare! 
We had booked 2 adjoining rooms for a 2 night stay, 3 adults 4 kids. The restaurant was undergoing renovations and the kids club isn't on at the moment but we didn't mind as the shopping centre nearby kept us occupied. 
We had rooms 304 and 306 which were on the first floor close to reception, but there was a lot of noise from the corridor. The curtains also didn't meet which woke us early however all this pales into insignificance after the disaster night we had on the second night!
We were woken (both rooms) from our broken sleep in the early hours of the morning by a loud guest returning home. He went into the room next to us with a few friends and after a prolonged period of shouting and banging about a fight must have started as we could hear something (or someone) being thrown against the wall adjoining our room. All the children had awoken at this stage and we're quite scared. My sister  phoned reception and security came up and asked them to keep the noise down...however these hooligans carried on with this behaviour and even started to threaten the security who came back. This continued on and eventually security removed these guests from the hotel. At this stage it was close to 4am and we were relieved to try and settle back to sleep...however security just put these guests outside the front doors immediately below our rooms! At this stage one of the one of the guys started screaming threats at security...the exact threat was ""I'm going to get a gun and come back and shoot you in the morning"" and also ""I'll shoot you in the face and you will be drenched with blood"" this was screamed over and over but with plenty of profanities! The children were hysterical at this stage!! This continued for about 20 mins until they finally disappeared into the underground car park. No one called the gardai, no one called to reassure us that the violent guests would not come back or to tell us that our vehicles were safe in the underground car park. It was the worst night I have ever had and it was supposed to be a relaxing family break to help us get over a recent family bereavement. On checkout the receptionist was next to useless. She called the duty manager who was apologetic and took our details. 
 Well my sister received a call from the hotel today who (not so generously) offered us a free meal on our next stay...needless to say I don't think we could drag our kids back after this experience! We had booked this room well in advance and really should have been on a floor for families not raucous drunk young men. We will not be back.",1,2017,01,31
249,"Good, but slipped up ","Nice clean and bright hotel. Very comfortable and a good nights sleep. 

The reception staff were very badly trained. Could not answer the simplest of questions, that really should be roll off the tongue answers. 

Room was freezing. Rang reception and all they done was send a portable heater. 

Tried charging for overnight parking. Not a chance, after no heating working in our room. 

Nice place, but reception needs more training and rooms should be checked to be in working order before setting. ",3,2017,01,29
249,Dirt and terrible service!,"Used to visit a hotel for business meetings, but stayed as an overnight leisure guest for the first time. And last.

Read over ""terrible"" comments about this place after a check out and could not agree more. Really surprised that similar events happened to us. Means no management involvement after feedback here. A shame, so here comes one star from me too. 

Attaching photos of filth in the room - hair on carpets (behind the door, so cleaners do not care), stains everywhere and dust on bulbs. Toilet speaks for itself.

Were asked to purchase swim hats for €3 although some people did not wear them in the pool. Staff don't care.

Sleepy staff during breakfast, not offering a coffee and being late with poached eggs- we finished breakfast when 4 overcooked eggs were delivered. We only had one, when realised they were hard inside. Staff taking plates away did not even bother asking whether there was something wrong. Dirty plates were left on our table for a long time while staff were walking around. The girl who took the order for the eggs did not even go to the kitchen, but went wiping more tables. Sorry?? 

Went to have lunch before a check out and Gusto restaurant has a sign to go to Kudos. Kudos had no hot food, just sandwiches. Girl at the bar said there was some renovation happening. Was not too bothered about it. There are Kudos room service menus on tables in rooms though serving food from 12pm. 

Here was a post about lack of customer service skills at reception and clearly nothing has been done since. While waiting in the queue to check out another guest was ignored by a receptionist when a guest said ""bye"" to her. She just stared at the screen. She kept staring when another lady came over. She said ""hi"" to to the lady without even looking at her.

We were called by a girl next to her, who quickly took the payment, printed the receipt and said ""bye"". I asked whether she was going to ask us how was the stay, she panicked and apologised. Not good enough. Too late, hence the post here. Receptionist's job is to make sure the guests are welcomed first and then make sure the stay was pleasant. Not a rocket science? Not in this hotel apparently. Both management and staff themselves are to blame - common sense to ask the question about the stay if you work in hospitality.",1,2017,01,29
249,First Class Hotel,"Quality hotel with excellent location, customer service, food, comfort and cleanliness.  Kids really enjoyed the stay and hotel really caters for families and staff were well trained and helpful - special mention to Jamie at breakfast - has a natural talent for customer service and a pleasure to deal with! We will be back!",5,2017,01,29
249,Top star stay!,"Wonderful hotel in a wonderful location, Liffey valley shopping centre virtually minutes away. 
Clean and comfortable rooms, excellent food in Gustos and amazing cocktails in Kudos! Perfect for a girls night. Would definitely recommend ",5,2017,01,23
249,Not a quiet night's sleep,"Stayed over new year, there seems to be a difficulty with lots of kids playing in the corridors - not such a problem during the day, but when the noise level late at night is similar to what you'd find in most play parks during a summer's day, then it becomes a problem.

Apparently the rooms in the basement are quiet so if I were ever to venture back then maybe I'd head down there.

Breakfast is good, meals in the Italian restaurant which seems to open from 6.00pm was excellent - bar food is extremely limited, there's a good bar across the road with reasonable bar food, also good restaurants at the nearby shopping centre which open late.

Not likely to go back.",2,2017,01,23
249,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in the Clarion hotel last weekend and had a fantastic experience. It's a stones throw from Liffey valley shopping centre so we spent the day shopping and then came back to the hotel for cocktails in the bar it was the perfect way to spend an afternoon. That night we enjoyed a gorgeous dinner in Gusto's restaurant in the hotel. Brilliant location, huge breakfast selection at the buffet and the staff were all so helpful, we had a brilliant time and we'll definitely be back! ",5,2017,01,23
249,"Overpriced, appalling service and breakfast carnage","Stayed here recently as a family. Check in took over 25 minutes. Rooms were average but very dirty underneath the sofabed that my children had to sleep in. Dined in Italian restaurant. Food good but service shocking. Next morning, breakfast was like a car crash site. I counted over 15 staff and 4 managers and the place was still a disaster zone. Poor food and a strange lack of cutlery. Spoke to a manager who refused to give his name but he had a strange dent in his head and were told he would take a formal complaint on our departure. returned and asked for him but was told he had gone for the day but the receptionist thought his name was Andy (?).
Do not stay here unless you have t. There are much better hotels within minutes",1,2017,01,21
249,I had to travel to Dublin for one night and stayed here what a magnificent Hotel,"I was given an apartment which was not only immaculately clean but had everything I could have asked for, including a huge bed! I was absolutely delighted, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, It has everything from a lovely restaurant, to a gym ect google it and you to will be impressed.",5,2017,01,19
249,Saturday 14th Nightmare,"Maybe this was Just an off day for hotel.... Our room was big and spacious. The walls had marks and scratches and tan on them but I can deal with that. it started when i brought my daughter (3) downstairs to the pool. The main pool was closed so the kids pool was very overcrowded leaving not much play area for my daughter. These things happen I'm aware. 
After our pool visit we went to our room and freshened up and went across to the nearby shopping centre and done a bit of shopping and afterwards we went for some dinner. Be arrived back to the hotel between 9.20-9.45. My fiancé and I decided we would have one drink before heading off to bed with our little one. Went to the bar, ordered a drink of which they had little selection for my partner. Never the less we got our drink only for the barman to say, by the way our policy is no kids after 9. Now I had no problem with that but for him to say it AFTER I have received and paid for my drinks is totally wrong, leaving us with no option but to leave the bar AND the fact that there were kids running and playing around the bar was a bit mind boggling. 
We said we would go up to my daughters grandmothers room which was a few doors down from ours to say goodnight. After about half an hour or so of chitchat we headed up to our room (338) We all went inside and got ready for bed, my little one was exhausted from her lovely day out and then shopping and dinner. We could hear noise from next door, it had to have been next door as it was that loud through the closed connecting doors. People shouting and screaming at one another and kids screaming. I know people are on holidays so I let it go for a period of time. After over an hour of this carry on it was so loud. My daughter was crying because she couldn't sleep. I wouldn't mind if there was a break in the noise but it was constant. I decided I would ring down to complain and just as I pick up the phone I hear a knock on the door at their room. I hang up the phone. I hear a staff member asking them to keep the noise down and respect other guests. Of course they said they would.....
The staff were up a further 3 times!!!!! And on the last occasion it was a manger with security removing  two individuals that were very loud and drunk. They kept screaming abuse at the manager. A guest from across the way opened his door and said please can you keep it down as I've small kids only to screamed at. As they were escorted passed our room the security or manager kept saying to them you have to go back to your own room, to which one replied, we have no room, we are not staying at hotel!!!! This infuriated me!!!! Not even residents at the hotel and it's after 1a.m. After all of us guests paying good money to stay in family rooms!! Completely unacceptable and just when you think that's over, where does security escort to the two drunks?? Right down outside our bedroom window! A further 45mins- hour of abuse and foul language, my daughter eventually fell asleep! She woke up the next morning more tired than she went to bed! 
Next morning we got up and went and had breakfast before checking out, the breakfast was good and great selection to be had but the fry could have been hotter.
After breakfast we went up and got our bags to check out. And of course the usual How was your stay was asked, I told the two ladies on reception all of the above, Nadine was one of their names, only to be told that they are so sorry about it and they knew nothing about it , that it was the night team who were on last night would know all about it and would I like to speak to her manager about it even though he is part of the day team wouldn't know anything about it. I said no it's not your fault. It was handled very poorly last night and something must be doen about it but probably won't. She said will I take your email address and number and get the night manager in question to contact you about a discount or complimentary stay in the future, I told the girl nicely that you have all my details from my booking and that I look forward to getting a mail from him.........

Needless to say it's Thursday and that happened 5 nights ago.....

Don't think I'd be rushing back at all let alone anytime soon.... residents have to pay for parking as well.....

I wouldn't mind but the hotel in itself looked clean, it's in a great location and has a nice child play area. Such a pity because the beds seemed comfortable, or maybe that's just because sleep was well needed...",2,2017,01,19
249,OK hotel,"Room was clean. The hotel is one of these big impersonal hotels. Reception is a conveyor belt type. On the up side they serve breakfast from 6am. We opted to eat in the restaurant which is 'Italian'. Had 1 starter and 2 pizzas washed down with 4 glasses of wine 62.50 euro. The pizza was awful, left half of it. The cheese seemed to be cheap, very little tomato sauce. My partners pizza, pepperoni was equally as bad and only half was eaten again. The service is slow and seems to take ages and there was hardly anyone there. Hotel is ok for 67 euro room only but to be honest, I have stayed in far better for less and eaten better food for less too. One to miss.",3,2017,01,17
249,"Enjoyable, clean, spacious, great customer service","I took my partner here for his birthday. We found check in and check out very easy and quick. We requested a late checkout and we given unril 2pm free of charge which we were extremely pleased about. 
The rooms were spacious and clean. The room we intially checked in to had quite a bad leak from the bathroom sink. We reported the issue to the front desk and they immediatley changed our room although we would have been happy with maintainance coming and fixing it. But A* to the hotel to speedy resolution. 
We had issues with the key cards on a few occasions where they were not working. Whilst every time the staff were happy to do thier magic to make them work it did become a nusence and inconvenient. 
The rooms did not have any way of controlling the heat manually, we phoned down to reception to see if there was anywhere we could turn up the heat but were told that the radiators would come on when the temperature dropped to a certain level. So if your in a rush and havent dried your clothes fully before arrival dont expect to dry them in the room. 
Other than those few minor issues, the hotel was beautiful, the staff were helpful and friendly, issues were resolved quickly and we enjoyed our stay here. ",4,2017,01,17
249,January 14th,"We stayed in a family room on Sat Jan 14th. The room itself was nice and plenty of space for 2 adults, 2 kids and an Infant. Breakfast was very nice and plenty of choice. 

However having 3 kids and needing to be up at 6 in the morning we were dissappointed with the noise on the corridors after midnight even after a phone call to reception the continued for some time. It seems there was a large group on our floor that continued to shout and slam doors. ",3,2017,01,15
249,30/12 disappointing customer service ,"Arrived on the 30/12 to meet up with some friends that were home from the US. 

We arrived around 3pm checked in and dropped our luggage to the room. We took a 5 minute stroll to the Liffey valley shopping center which is very  convenient it's got everything,  cinema and plenty of options for nice food. 

We met your friends and headed for town, had a really great night and catch up. we got back to the hotel around 2:30am with a few drinks on board said our good nights and went to bed. We were staying in room 325 a really nice room large comfortable bed and clean. Could not fault the room. 

Here's where it started to go down hill, even with a few drinks on us we woke numerous times during the night due to a banging noise! There was a corridor door right by our room, every time someone walked through it banged 3 times almost clicking closed. This was extremely frustrating the following morning when you expect to get a nice lay in etc. 

On check out I said I'd mention it to the lady at the desk. I was not looking for anything may I add. just so they would be aware possibly get it checked and save the next guest a restless nights sleep.. 

The lady at the desk had the worst attitude I have ever experienced. To be fair I don't even think it was her fault, she clearly was not given the tools as part of basic customer service training to deal with a complaint. The hotel management Seriously need to review what exactly is happening at their front desk, the face of the hotel. 

I would stay at this hotel again for the location only, But I would like to think that a hotel of its standing would have the basics in place and invest in its people giving them the tools to deal with any situation. ",1,2017,01,11
249,"Good Location, Nice facilities","We stayed here over St Patricks weekend. The bus into town is only about 10 minutes - get a leap card from the shopping centre before hand!

The hotel facilities are really good and the rooms are sizeable and comfy.",4,2017,01,11
249,overcrowded new year,"long queue to check in, rooms spacious and well maintained, breakfast plenty of choice, but self service even to the point of making own tea /coffee. Tasty enough.The hotel itself seemed to be filled to capacity and beyond, by lots and lots of children, allowed to run riot by their parents and not prevented by staff. The bar area was jampacked with new year revellers making service at bar very slow. All in all not a relaxing break at all, don't tgink i could recommend this hotel.",3,2017,01,06
249,"GUSTO!!, service only dreamt of!!","Our stay at the hotel was very pleasant, comfy beds, accommodating staff, clean and serene atmosphere.
Now we have two very boisterous, PICKY, fussy children, both 4years old. We had a very smooth time of it during breakfast, it was busy but well maintained, as clean as physically possible for the volume of people, plenty of lovely food, drinks.. very happy..
Come dinner time our boys where very loud, cranky, hungry etc. One starts screaming, the other joins, then comes in David, **heroic music**,,, a manager if I recall correctly? In a suit anyway.
He was amazing, spoke TO our boys and not to us ABOUT our boys. Had a lovely wee chat and informed them that to be as tall as himself they must eat up and must let mammy and daddy have their food also. WELL ive never had two more behaved, quiet, full babies in my life.  They loved him, he gave them a great giggle with their little chat and made them feel great, calmed and ready to tuck in. (Food was DEVINE) This is a level of communication we have never before recieved in any other establishment and I have to say it just made our trip as normally the kids are ignored or seen as a nuisance. The boys want to back to gusto asap. Great job guys its people like himself who make the experience so enjoyable, he is a credit to the hotel/restaurant. We are due another trip soon and 100% know where we're staying. Many thanks again for the wonderful experience all round. Ann, Mark and the twinsies.",5,2017,01,06
249,Very disappointed,"My partner and I decided to bring our baby daughter to this hotel for her first New Year's Eve. We went swimming, it was great. We went for dinner in the Italian restaurant, it was delicious. Staff were lovely. Everything was going great until we went back to our room. There was dozens of unsupervised children running up the hall banging and slamming  doors, screaming and shouting. There was music blaring from at least 2 rooms. It took me 3 hrs to get my baby to sleep and it was 5am when I eventually got to sleep. Not one member of staff tried to stop the kids ds or music. Other guests decided to fill lunch boxes with breakfast leaving hardly anything. No one stopped them. As an apology for what happened, the receptionist validated our car park ticket, which was only €6. But when we left the car park barriers were open. Great start to 2017! (Not!)",2,2017,01,04
249,Illegaly breaking safety regulations by approving of smoking in rooms and corridors  / Children running riot,"Stayed at this hotel on January 1st and had a LONG drive the following day. Chose the hotel because of location and the standards it advertises but what lies they tell. I was lucky to get a couple of hours sleep only and falling asleep going home several times and having to stop the car for safety.Starting with most serious issue. They clearly approve of guests smoking throughout the hotel, in rooms and corridors. Throughout the early evening til almost morning people were constantly smoking in the corridors and the smoke was coming under the room door causing severe passive smoking. My breathing is not good already and I had to place a towel at bottom of door on several occasions throughout the evening and night. Not that it stopped the smoke but cut it down slightly. Clearly the smoke alarms throughout the corridors and rooms are disconnected too because the amount of smoke present SHOULD have triggered them. Being a fire personnel I know this. So issue number 2 is that smoke alarms are probably deliberately disconnected which makes staying there dangerous and the allowing of smoking highly ILLEGAL.  Another issue being the kids running riot until very late at night in the corridor and constantly knocking on guest doors. On complaining to reception in morning it was clear they were aware of all of it and clearly approve of it. IF this had been travel lodge group they would have refunded the cost in the morning and charged the guilty parties for the bill as well as taking action over the incidents in question.  So the smoking issue and alarms issue WILL  be getting reported to the fire inspectors in the Dublin area. Perhaps a SEVERE fine or being shut down for several months will be a lesson to the Clarion group.",1,2017,01,03
249,"Read the reviews before you book, price and location is not everything","Family of 4, last minute booking with a view of taking in some New Year shopping. This for me would not be the ideal location for a quiet romantic break, as a family it ticked our boxes but we did check in late, got up for breakfast early (8am) and hit the pool as it opened for kids (9am). One lift was out of action but my beef was about a set of fire doors that banged as they closed- right next to our room(reported to staff). Other reviewers commented on the lack of sound proofing between rooms, I would concur with this. 
Yes the place was full of families and kids that seemed unsupervised (notices in the lift suggest this is not an unusual occurrence). We ate in the restaurant as Kudos as so noisy it was impossible to have a conversation. Food was acceptable and so was breakfast. 
Room was spacious, hotel looks great, clean and modern, pool and spa area were great but as I say we went early. 
My concern is that despite the 4 stars with continuous poor reviews this hotel will begin to suffer unless they address some of the issues highlighted. I would return and would recommend for location and price but with the caviats mentioned. 
Parking of 6euro was a bit of a pain (I like other guests seem to hate this charge) especially as I don't know how they would prove you had or hadn't paid as the barrier was up. 
Tread carefully read the reviews but on the whole our trip was not adversely affected by our stay.",3,2017,01,03
249,Not ideal,"This stay just started out all wrong.  It started upon arrival.  Parking is horrible.  There was a gate across the entrance that was malfunctioning and we couldn't get in.  Then after parking illegally and going in, they came out and manually let us in, but it's not free for guests (really?  just build it into the room rate please, stop with the bs extra charges).  The restaurant was closing as I arrived so forget about dinner.  Room was OK, breakfast was not great.  I don't think I'd stay here again.",2,2017,01,03
249,Mayhem ,"We go away every new year as a large extended family ranging from a one year old to an eighty year old, about 30 of us in total. This year we chose The Clarion. We arrived about 2.30 to be greeted at the door with a huge queue to check in, after 2 hours we reached reception only to be told some rooms were not yet ready and we would have to return to reception later. We accepted this and waited in the bar area. Whilst there we did notice a large number of children running around but this didn't bother us as there were children in our party too. After finally getting our rooms we did notice the corridors were very busy with lots of kids and tracksuit clad parents going in and out of each others rooms, this continued for 48 hours solidly with no thought or respect for any other hotel users. It was simply a case of 'the lunatics took over the asylum ' and ran amok unhindered by hotel staff. Many of them had checked out on New Year's Day but were still there on the 2nd , how? It was an extremely intimidating and uncomfortable environment and I would never return here nor would I recommend it to any one else unless you want to feel as if your in an episode of Love Hate.",1,2017,01,02
249,Kids running riot all over the place ,"Booked to stay overnight for a bit of new year shopping - as soon as we arrived we noticed the place awash with kids- Those kids seem to run riot unsupervised & screaming until all hours of the night. Kids were sitting eating crisps and popcorn on the stairwells too. Not allowed in the bar after 9pm so obviously left in the rooms instead. 
One of the 2 lifts was out of order. The vending machine on our floor was too, therefore water @€2 a small bottle was not available. (P.s. Vending machine prices vary from floor to floor)
I do understand it's a very busy time of the year and the staff are pushed to the limit
. 
Family rooms are generous size. Plenty of car parking. Rooms are okay, with tv and fan etc. No face clothes. Good location.Overall , Basic but adequate-but won't be back in a hurry",3,2017,01,01
249,Big disappointment,"Our work team Recently attended this hotel for our staff Christmas party night out. Over the years we've tried several hotels but this year we decided to try the clarion. we were a group of about 20 people so understandably we had set out to have a nice meal and drinks, which meant there was a lot of money spent! 
The service on the night was absolutely appalling from the rude staff at reception to ""security"" checking our handbags before the meal! Never in my life have I ever. We than sat down to a slapped up meal which was €55 ahead . During the meal we were then told they would not serve us wine to the table we had to go to the bar,  where we would be standing for 15minutes before we could get served.  Breakfast the next morning was also a big let down. Food was cold and cups had coffee stains on them.

I understand that it was your busiest time of year and it can be hard working under pressure, however it does not excuse the bad manners and lack of customer service skills that your staff should have. People pay good money to stay at your hotel and should at least be greeted with a smile, and feel comfortable enough to relax.
I had hoped I would enjoy my stay at the hotel as I had future plans to travel here again but after that experience I can truely say I will never be back.
Shocking experience the whole way through!",2,2017,01,01
249,An alright stay,Had a two night stay here recently. On arrival we were met with a slow queue and unpleasant receptionists at the end of that queue. Rooms were spacious and clean.  First evening we ate in kudos which had a small menu but nice food. Second evening we ate in the hotel restaurant.  Again a small menu but the food that was served was of a good standard. There was a great selection for breakfast in the mornings. The facilities were great with a good kids pool. The staff  (with the exception of the receptionist) were friendly and polite... but be warned they charge you €6 a night for the carpark. Why they charge this I don't know because they have enough signs up to say that the hotel is not responsible for your car or its belongings. ,3,2016,12,30
249,Very disappointed,Stayed here several times in the past and never had any problems but the one night we booked in recently I was very annoyed with the the treatment I received off the receptionist. Two other family members were staying in another part of the hotel and wanted to come over to our room for a glass of wine and a chat that night. When they tried to get past reception to go towards our room they were told they were not allowed. I had to walk the whole way down to reception to try and find out why and once I approached the receptionist about this he arrogantly fobbed me off. The fact that I am younger (23) I feel may have given him the idea he could treat me that way as I doubt someone older would have been disrespected like that. I paid good money to stay in the hotel that night and to be told two other family members couldn't come to my room and then when asking for a reason for this man to not even look at me and continue working at some thing else at the desk is so disrespectful and unprofessional. I won't be staying here again which is a pity as I had always liked the Clarion up until this.,1,2016,12,22
249,Businesses ,Use this hotel for sales meetings and business lunches.  Good meeting rooms which are fully equipped at no extra cost.  Food is good and reasonably priced.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  Overnight rates are reasonable for dublin.  Excellent value for money ,4,2016,12,20
249,"Location, and price the key","This hotel is for many travellers very well placed for accessing most points of interest in Dublin, in that it sits just off the M50 ring road, and is on the main access route from the West. Pricing due to various offers can be good, but as always Season will dictate. 
We found the room fine, clean is where we start with all hotels and this hotel was at least to us, that. Where we had a major problem was in the evening when we went for a meal in the bar area, my wife found a hair in her food, which no matter what happens afterwards is really unforgivable.",3,2016,12,15
249,Worst service ever!!!,"Me and my husband went for his birthday. We checked in at about 10pm after our flight landed we had to stand in the lobby for 45mins before being spoken to by a member of the team. The woman that served us told us that she couldn't find our name on the list that she had in front of her then turned to her colleague (who was serving another customer) and asked her to have a look as she had to go call her father ( this was incredibly rude) we were eventually checked in and settled for the night. We woke to go out for the day upon our return we were locked out of our room as the key didn't work due to the system issues from the night before. I spoke with the manager who promised to call me when we returned home to resolved our terrible Experience ( still to this day we haven't received a call I think he just said this to shut us up) I would never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone there service was atrocious. Very disappointed and upset with our experience and I'm her very very upset that we never received a call back from the ""manager"" that we spoke to ",1,2016,12,11
249,Not a good not a bad place to stay,"This is one of the places where there is no certain impression. You have good feelings on the bed, you face professional service and convenient location for airport connections. 
Also you have poor breakfast, old style bathroom and last century fashioned walls and decorations",3,2016,12,11
249,"""Modern Concrete Block""","I was among a delegation of linguists to attend a conference. The organisers booked our accommodation for 3 nights at Clarion Hotel. The hotel is pretty much impersonal and utilitarian. Reception staff polite and helpful. Long queues for reasonably good breakfast. Good size clean rooms, but empty little fridge, not even a tiny bottle of water. Stll, good vale for money.",3,2016,12,08
249,Ok considering the price,"Stayed here with my sister and mother in November for 1 night. I have stayed here a good few times because of the price and its location, great for kids but not as a romantic getaway by any means. Check in as always in this hotel was a painfully slow process. Cannot understand why they haven't at this stage reviewed there checking in procedures as I have literally always had to queue for at least 15 minutes to check in. Only one lift worked which in a hotel this size means again a lot of waiting. Room was a good 2 minute walk from reception, on getting to the room we couldn't enter. The room keys hadn't been activated. Back down to reception to rectify this. Room was plenty big for three, nice and clean. Good hot showers too with comfy beds. We ate in the new restaurant  and it was fantastic, great selection of anti pasta, pizza and pastas, great wine too. Staff weren't amazing could do with more training. One waitress though bed Sharon was great, she saved the rest of them. Would return for the food here!
Not a bad hotel at all especially when you consider the price. Just a shame the check always starts the stay on a bad note",3,2016,12,07
249,Bad service ,"My friends and I stayed in this hotel...Our rooms were perfect but the following morning when we went for breakfast, we had to que for 20min only to be told there was no seats available. We were then sent to another area for self service breakfast but the quantity of all food was Very limited and low and we had to ask staff 4 times for juice and twice more for glasses for the juice to (at this stage unimpressed staff member  that I caught rolling her eyes)...After paying for our breakfast with the room, we got leftovers.. we found this unacceptable....so we have decided not to return.",3,2016,12,06
249,A Great Hotel at Very Reasonable Price,"I have stayed at the Clarion for work purposes on two 6 month stints since October 2014, this is a really well equipped hotel with excellent/friendly staff, both restaurants, Gustos & The Kudos Bar, serve really tasty food and of course the Guinness is always excellent. Situated only a 20euro taxi ride from the city centre, with a well equipped shopping mall on it's doorstep I can wholeheartedly recommend the Clarion to those who are in Dublin on business or on a break to Dublin",4,2016,12,05
249,Average hotel,"The room was big and clean, we didn't eat dinner in the hotel instead we went across to the shopping centre for food. we went for a swim the pool was dirty and packed with kids throwing balls across the pool kids on floats! breakfast was so busy and we were sent to another restaurant were the food was cold and no selection",3,2016,11,30
249,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is nice but the service could be improved in general . There always seems to be a queue. When I checked in I found the room I was given was still a mess from the previous guest. This was at 7pm in the evening. They quickly changed the room which was good and the price per night is much better than city centre so it's good for business trips.

249,Noisy with thin walls,"Stayed for one night. 

Room: Very large, clean and with a comfortable big bed. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was good.  The walls are NOT SOUND PROOFED so we slept very badly. From arguing neighbours one side to being woken at 5.00 by children running around upstairs and then television on at 5.30 from the other side we got little sleep.

Staff: Pleasant

Parking: Easy to find underground parking where car felt safe.

Overall: Ok for one night but noisy and probably would not stay again.",2,2016,11,29
249,Clarion Hotel in Liffey Valley Dublin,This is a very nice hotel with rooms that are way bigger than what the standard European sized rooms are and just a very short walk to the mall. The room I was given had a bathtub! In-room amenities are superb with the in-room safe provided able to accommodate your laptop for safekeeping.  There's also a gym and a pool and a jacuzzi all available for your use! and the free wifi signal is excellent all over the hotel. The only thing to look out for is to ask for a room that is close or near the stairs or an elevator or else it's a pretty long walk to get to either one.  The front desk has a very courteous and very helpful and accommodating agent in the person of Nathalie(?). I'm not so sure about her name but she's the black front desk agent and she works in the mornings when I was there for 4days and 3nights from the 14th-17th of this month. ,5,2016,11,24
249,"Appalling, Unprofessional Service","This hotel lacks any class or basic professionalism one would expect from a four star hotel. I just stayed there for a number of nights as my relative was having surgery in The Hermitage nearby. 

Firstly the hotel does not offer a special rate for family members of patients in the hospital so do not be fooled. This is a lie.... they offer the same prices as if you book online. 

The decor and cleanliness is of a 2 or 3 star hotel. Shabby interior, lack of bathroom supplies and towels, grubby upholstery, etc. 

Staff lack any sort of manners or standards..... 

I had to ask to be served 3 times in Kudos Bar while staff, including management continued speaking to each other in my presence. 

The staff have not been trained to express gratitude or enquire about customer satisfaction. 

On arrival and departure it was pretty clear I am heavily pregnant and was laden down with luggage but was not offered any assistance. 

The hotel staff could not provide me with a taxi number but asked me to download the hailo app to save them the hassle. 

I wasn't asked when checking out how my stay was or if everything was OK. No ""Thank You"" or anything you would expect. 

I tried ordering room service but anything I wanted on the menu was not available as they were out! The room service operator was only concerned with how I would be paying and telling me about tray charges, etc.... they simply didn't want the hassle of the order. I had provided reception with my credit card details but he called back 20 minutes after taking my order to say they no longer had them and he couldn't process the order unless I paid in cash.... treated like I would run without paying!! Zero class.... just money, money, money. 

The food and drinks in the hotel are below standard and what you would expect in a low grade motel. This is by far the most disappointing stay I have ever had in a Clarion hotel and it does not offer any value for money. They even charge residents for car parking. They do not offer a special rate for a single room so you have to pay for 2 people regardless. I frequently stay in The Clarion in Cork and Limerick and have always been satisfied with my stay and with staff. 

I asked about how the car parking tickets operate and was basically grunted at by the receptionist. There were endless queues at reception with one girl on at any time I went downstairs. 

Appalling service..... avoid avoid avoid. Stay in a hostel for quarter the price for equal service. Staff are ignorant, unhelpful and unwilling.",1,2016,11,23
249,Not as good as expected ,"I didn't spend much time in the hotel due to arriving in quite late and then going out. The actual hotel is nice and we'll laid out. The staff on check in were very friendly.  

I had to go out to see family and got caught up in some awful fog which meant we didn't get back to the hotel until gone 11pm at night. This meant we missed dinner. There was a prepaid amount on the account and I did enquire with the desk about having room service in place of this. The manager on duty was not willing to help and said I would have to wait for the day manager to see if there was something he could do. I tried to order room service to then try and sort in the morning but was told that I would need to pay there and then. Given that the money was on the account I didn't have anything spare to get food so I had to go without. 

When I got up in the morning there was nobody to greet us for breakfast and the same manager was on from when I was in during the night so it was a good job I didn't get food because I would have lost out either way as I had an early start.

The breakfast was pleasant but not as great a variety as some hotels I've stayed in. 

The bed was Comfortable and the room well equipped. Be mindful of the parking charges as it's around 6 euro to park over 3 hours.  It's also close to some shopping amenities. ",3,2016,11,22
249,Great all rounder ,"I booked this hotel to hold a training session for our staff based in Ireland.  I was very impressed by the professionalism of the events staff who helped co-ordinate everything.  We booked three rooms for an overnight stay for staff, meeting facilities and lunch for 30.  The guest rooms were quiet and well appointed, big bed, the usual amenities, tea/coffee making facilities.  A few areas looking a little tired and could do with a touch up but overall a pleasant and stress free stay.  ",4,2016,11,21
249,Very noisy room,"I stayed for one night for a conference in a suite. The room was huge with a totally separate sitting room and small kitchen. Large separate bath room. 

The decor was dated and basic. 

The room overlooked the main dual carriage way. During the night the windows hardly deadened the traffic noise at all. 

The Asian restaurant was very good. Fast service and very authentic menu. 

The conference facilities were excellent. I would return but definitely ask for a room on the far side from the road. ",3,2016,11,18
249,Over night stay," Well I booked this overnight stay through TripAdvisor. I have to say we were disappointed in the hotel.
Our room had a cot in it. Why? The reason given was that it was left from a previous booking!!! Not really acceptable. The room itself was tatty - damage paint work and plaster visible on the walls and a broken mirror in the hall.
They did give us another room which was better.
General decor in the hotel corridors is tired not really what you would expect of a 4 star hotel. Damaged fixtures, missing lift buttons etc.

We ate in the Kudos restaurant- it lacked any cudos. We were told by reception it was Asian and European- it is Asian only.

We ordered wine - the manager served us in wet glasses - and one of them had lipstick stains. Come on this is definitely not 4 star management.

The only save of the evening was our waitress. A very pleasant young lady, Natalie Mullen, she was considerate helpful and salvaged the evening.
The food- well........ unimaginative and very average. Udon noodles in a laksa. That's Japan meets Malaysia. Come on guys get it right. My wife had a chicken in Tumeric beer batter- over cooked and heavy. Beer batter is not Asian.
 Desert menu- boring and limited 
Ah well thank goodness for Natalie.

I would think again about booking a Clarion and would avoid this particular hotel.

249,Modern hotel at a great location,"This was the first hotel i stayed in on my trip to Ireland. One reason I booked this hotel is it is served by the Airport Hopper airport bus service. It's a modern style hotel.
My double room was spacious, comfortable, clean and quiet. The bathroom was the same.
Was easy to get to Dublin city centre from the hotel. It's a short walk to the footbridge over the N4 motorway to the Dublin City bus stop, which is served by multiple bus routes.
I ate in the dining room three morning; it's buffet style. Had the full Irish breakfast; the food was delicious with plenty of choices.
The staff was friendly and helpful.
Would stay here again.",5,2016,11,18
249,Comfortable stay ,"It was an average stay for us - nothing to set it apart from other hotels. Except that they were having trouble with their system the night we arrived and there were fire alarms going off left and right directly outside our room. So that wasnt very fun. 
Room and bathroom were very clean, beds were ok. Service was good; everyone we spoke to was friendly. Restaurant closed earlier than we expected so we had to order from pizza hut to get a late dinner 
It's quite away from Dublin airport and the city centre, but is about a 10 minute walk to the shopping centre, which is a 2 minute walk to the bus stop on the other side of the freeway. Busses can take you to city centre easily.
Good value hotel ",3,2016,11,17
249,Good value for money ,Stayed here on a Saturday in a family room. Room really comfortable and clean. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Plenty of parking available. Food in the bar was good. Convenient location to M 50 ,4,2016,11,16
249,Familycentric,"A hotel truely set up around keeping the whole family happy. Pool area was ideal for the kids with a jacuzzi area for the parents. 

The food in the Italian area was a real surprise it was great and breakfast was good although there was a queue. 

I'd recommend doing the hotel deal with Tayto park tickets included-we also visited Kildare shopping village while we were there(30mins away). ",4,2016,11,15
249,A great place to stay with family. ,"We stayed here on Friday the 11th November. Check in was fast and a lovely young man was very helpful. We booked a 2 bed apartment for me, my husband & our 4 children. It did not disappoint. It was massive with 2 double bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a small kitchenette and a big living room with a pull out couch. Had all the mod cons supplied (hairdryer, fans, iron, TVs in all rooms) 2 balconies looking out on to the outdoor playground. The playground is fantastic for the kids, there is also an indoor playground but we did not get as far as it. There is also a kids club & swimming pool. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to explore these. Our apartment was lovely the only down side was that the counter in the kitchen had not been wiped down & there was chewing gum left on the side of the bath by the previous guests. This is why I only rated it with a 4 star not a 5, but this did not put us off and we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who need a family safe Holel to bring kids. When I checked out I mentioned it to a helpful girl on reception, she apologised and made a note so it would not happen again. The staff are really friendly and helpful with all requests and always have a smile for the children. We did not have dinner here we went over to the arc bar. Check it out food was fab. Breakfast was very expensive so again we chose to make our own in the apartment. Plenty parking with underground parking. It's €6.00 a day. As I all ready said I really would recommend this hotel & with the big shopping Center Liffy Vally only a 5 min drive/ 10 min walk away it's a perfect place to stay",4,2016,11,13
249,Excellent service from Sharon (Blonde),"Just called into the Clarion Hotel for a tea and scone with my wife.
A lovely waitress whom I later found out to be Sharon( I call her blonde Sharon because there are two Sharon's working in the hotel) asked if she could be of help. We ordered our tea and scones which were served with a smile and a chat. This Lady was a breath of fresh air. One could tell she loved the interaction with people. You could also tell she loved her job and loved doing what she does.I told her if I was a secret shopper I would give her a very high rating. It really is the simple things that make customers feel welcome and she had the simple things in bucket fulls.If you ever read this Sharon well done. Even though it was only tea and scones we were two very happy satisfied customers. We will call again.",5,2016,11,11
249,Lovely hotel,"A very nice hotel . Rooms are nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. The gym is well equipped and a nice pool are with steam room , Jacuzzi etc. 
The breakfast was nice also.
The staff were helpful with catching buses etc",5,2016,11,07
249,Lively family city hotel ,"Stayed at this lively hotel.  First impressions was it could do with a lick of paint all over outside  but once inside was fresh and a bright atmosphere. Check in was efficient and quick as a lot of families might stay over night on a shopping trip . Family room was fine for four people with three beds,  often not seen in other hotels. Evening meal in Italian restaurant was lovely , staff there were friendly with a lot of young families there they were very patient with them.  Breakfast is fine,  tip is  to get down early enough to avoid the queues later on.  ",4,2016,11,06
249,Dublin hotel,"Brilliant stay   Upgraded to apartment which was nice . Was hot though all the time central heating on permanently. But would stay again . System was down when we got there though , Also someone walked in our room at 2:30am with same room number and key !",5,2016,11,06
249,This Is Not A Four Star Hotel,"I stayed in the Clarion Liffey Valley for the last three nights with my wife and two children. We used the hotel as a base during the midterm to enjoy a few days exploring Dublin. I booked an executive suite with breakfast & one evening meal included. It was the perfect arrangement for our family. I had researched The Clarion Liffey Valley and the Castleknock Hotel & Country Club, both of which I've stayed in before, prior to finalising any arrangements. I chose the Clarion as it was better value. My memory of the Clarion was not the same as it is now. I found the Clarion to be under staffed, poorly staffed, shabby and penny pinching. From the start I found the reception desk at check in to be under staffed with reception desks empty even though there was a queue of about 5 groups looking to check in. An easy situation to happen, it didn't bother me and I thought no more about it. The hotel room was perfectly laid out, the kids in one room and us in the other. The room was clean but there were marks on the wall and door frames, it could do with a few touch ups. Shortly after arriving in our room, my wife phoned the hotel operator looking for a travel cot for our daughter. We forgot to request one on booking. We were told one would be delivered shortly. Unfortunately this was not the case. Almost two hours later, we had to phone again asking for the travel cot. That evening I rang the hotel operator and the Gusto restaurant about reserving a table. Eventually I got through to room service and easily made a reservation. Dinner was lovely, we were on the deal menu. I'd the bruschetta and chicken supreme. My wife had the chicken wings and pepperoni pizza. Dinner lasted over two hours, that's a long time with kids. During our dinner a lady in a clown costume came into the restaurant promoting the paid kids club that evening and then left again, with out any interaction with any child. My wife left before dessert with our youngest child. I couldn't fault the food in Gusto. Our waitress was lovely but couldn't cope with her work load, she struggled to keep up and often made mistakes. A duty manager was happy to stand there idle while trying to look busy. The kids enjoyed the experience so we had planned on returning to the restaurant later during our stay. The following morning we joined the constant queue for breakfast and had a nice breakfast. The breakfast was nice, it's served in the Gusto restaurant but it's not fit for purpose. It's too small a room with too many people passing through. We left the hotel early that day and spent the most of the day at a local theme park. On our way out I asked at reception about getting the car parking validated. I was handed a ticket for the car park, said thank you and thought no more about it. That evening on our way back to the hotel we had dinner in the bar across from the hotel. The food here was lovely too. We returned to the hotel and went to bed. The following morning my wife joined the breakfast queue only to be told that the restaurant was full but there was an overflow service in the bar area. This was a mess. There were limited options, guests had to wait ages for requested items and there were dirty tables everywhere. As we left the hotel to go on another adventure, I went to reception and asked to have my parking validated. I was told there was a pay station next to the main door & that the cost to park in the hotel car park for 24hours was €6. I refused to pay it and explained to the receptionist that I had gotten a validated ticket from reception the previous day. She continued to say there was a charge of €6, I then asked for the manager. The manager would not speak directly to me and a validated ticket for the car park was thrown at me. This was the straw that broke the camels back. This shows the cost cutting and penny pinching that is going on at the Clarion Liffey Valley Hotel. As a result of this we decided not to return to Gusto restaurant that evening, we ate at one of the many restaurants in the Liffey Valley shopping centre instead. We had a great trip to Dublin, the running of the hotel didn't ruin it but I won't be returning to the Clarion Liffey Valley Hotel. We should have returned to Castleknock. I'm not normally one to knock hotels or any businesses, but I've been disappointed enough by this hotel to give it the poor review that it deserves. ",2,2016,11,04
249,OK,"Check in was pretty awful. We did arrive at 3pm, check in time, but the queue was still just as bad a couple of hours later. We waited 25 mins...and when you have two lads that just wanted to go to the pool, it felt like hours.
The rooms were OK and the beds were very comfortable. The shower was weak and the plumbing in the toilet was awful. Didn't flush and had to use toilets in reception. We were travelling with another couple and when we booked the rooms we asked to be near each other......we were on completely different floors. We also asked if they could put a balloon or decoration in the room for my sons birthday. We were told on three occasions that this would happen but nothing in the room at all. Which was very disappointing. 
We also had a lovely view of a building site which started very early in the morning. Not what you want on a holiday. 
We had breakfast included in price of the room.....only reason we went. The breakfast wasn't the best. Cooked breakfast was lukewarm, not a lot of choice with hot drinks....a few herbal or fruit teas would have been nice. 
Our boys enjoyed the swimming pool. If you have swimming caps take them. You must use them in the pool. Otherwise you'll have to buy them. €3 each. There is also a steam room and a sauna. There are lockers, you must leave a €10 deposit. 
OK if you need a quick stay on a road trip or need to be near the airport....not for a Dublin City Break. Only option of getting into Dublin City is a bus that you pick up at the shopping centre, outside ""Vue"". Make sure you have the exact amount of money as the buses only take change,  no notes. €3.30 adult single €1.40 children's single. They do not do returns. 

We will be returning to Dublin, but not to this hotel. 
",2,2016,11,03
249,Don't stay here. The service is appalling me the hotel is tired and worn. ,"On arrival, I was nearly 25 deep in a queue to check in. 

Check on was average, and the reception staff didn't seem to know that much about the hotel. 

The room was ok but tired. 

Went to the restaurant, Kudos. It was also very tired. The staff where clearly overwhelmed. Multiple people were complaining about the amount of time their food took. I had some wok flavoured noodles which turned out to be boiled noodles with raw spring onions on top. 

Half way through my meal, the staff decided they would put the football on and lowered the projector screen which landed on my table whilst I was eating. 

When I called the operator for information - because there was absolutely nothing in the room; firstly it took an age to answer and when my call was answered. The operator was nothing short of rude. 

Pretty shambolic overall. ",1,2016,11,02
249,Scary,"Nice thought and good will but location of hotel is not the best choice. If you need place to sleep ok but dont go out when dark outside, it could be dangerous. Enjoy dublin, enjoy ireland but clarion is not hotel for family.",3,2016,11,01
249,A dissapointing 3rd stay ,We booked an executive suite for 2 nites. While we appreciate it was a busy weekend the management team know well in advance how busy the hotel will be and should prepare more. Our room 429 was right beside the elevator and stairs. The noise from the lifts was really loud. I called reception on sunday morning and was told someone wld call me back to see about the possibility of changing. No one called back and we were out all day so with 2 tired kids we just thought  no point in saying anything. The queues for everything was crazy. Two bar staff in the main bar. 20 minutes I waited for a juice before giving up and going to gustos and asking for a juice to be told it wld be easier for me to go back to the bar...which I stupidly did. Another 20 minutes later I waited. I then went back to gustos and a very helpful waitress got me one. We paid for the kids disco and we were told at reception to go to the kids club area..along with 2 other family's we stood outside in the cold for more than 15 mins and no sign of any disco..it was in a different room. The breakfast this morning was nothing short of a disgrace. We were seated in the bar area as the main area was packed to the rafters. Food was cold. No milk on tables no cutlery. Basically everyone was pretty annoyed. The clarion and in particular liffey valley promote them selves on being family friendly. .this wkend was actually very stressful in comparison to previous stays. I didn't want to leave a poor review as I thought I'd clear it up at reception.  Checked out and receptionist didn't even look at us. She did ask how our stay was but it was only to tick a box and she couldn't not having given 2 hoots how our stay was. Food in gustos was brilliant on Saturday evening. We had booked to stay their again towards end of Nov but after the chaos this weekend  I'm considering cancelling and going elsewhere. ,2,2016,10,31
249,good hotel,"I  stayed here at the weekend  with family and i was very happy with the room and services, staff very nice and friendly and efficient despite the hotel very busy with checkins. I thought the breakfast could be a bit warmer but nothing was too much trouble for the breakfast staff when asked for something more or fresher , as i did with eggs, thank you, we had a very pleasant stay.",4,2016,10,31
249,"Lovely hote,l let down by shambolic staff","This is a beautiful hotel. We stayed the night before the Dublin Marathon  on 29th Oct.  I had booked a family room and then added breakfast. Upon arrival I found checkin very slow but  not a major problem. The receptionIst was not particularly friendly or welcoming. She said I hadn't booked breakfast even though I had a confirmation email proving it. Eventually she added it on, I paid the full bill including parking fee. No information was provided to me about breakfast times, check out time etc, The apartment was fantastic however we found sunglasses under the bed so cleaning couldn't have been thorough. There was only enough shower gel and towels tea, coffeeetc for one person so I had to find a maid in the main hotel and get the items myself. In the meantime you couldn't get moving n reception. People were queued out the door in the check-in line. Families with babies and young children were complaining that their rooms were not ready. This seemed to be the situation for the majority for our stay. Later we noted the tables in the bar were not cleared, we were in about an hour and the dirty glasses from the last people were not lifted. The next morning  went early for breakfast, which was not too exciting. My husband and children went down for breakfast later only to be told it hadn't been booked. I had the receipt to prove it had been paid for. At checkout my husband asked for the carpark ticket to be validated, he was told to just put it into the machine. We did that and it was trying out charge us double the fees.  My husband had to go back to reception again to get the ticket sorted as I'd already paid for it. This is a lovely hotel however a lot of staff training is required to bring it up to an acceptable standard.",3,2016,10,31
249,Excellent service,"I stayed with my daughter one week ago overnight. We arrived late and we're greeted by a very pleasant receptionist. The room was spotless and very comfortable. Shower was fantastic.
Breakfast was superb. Great variety and again everyone was so helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back 😊",5,2016,10,30
249,Vey good hotel,Lovely hotel. With a luxurious and spacious swimming pool and a kids clu very child friendly. Staff very friendly. Would recommend for family's with young children. Breakfast can be a bit slow and when it's gone it's gone,5,2016,10,29
249,"Reasonably Priced, Friendly Staff ","I stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a business trip to Dublin.

The rooms are of a good size and comfortable. A word of caution, my colleague stayed on the top floor and had several problems with water flow, i.e. Not able to take a shower at peak times!!!

A decent Breakfast and very helpful staff. Hotel is well situated for the Liffey Valley, Clondalkin area.

Car Parking is chargeable at €6 Euro per night.

Happy to stay here again.",4,2016,10,29
249,Kudos restaurant ,"My dinner of fish and chips was fine. My friend ordered an Asian dish but it was terrible. It lacked 7 out of the 10 ingredients it had on the menu. 
Manager was a nice guy, done what he could to help but was a bit too late. He also didn't charge for it so that was decent of him. 
Won't be back to this particular part of the clarion. ",3,2016,10,28
249,A good option for an early flight out,This was a good hotel for a flight out of Dublin the next day. It was clean and the bed comfortable. It was also very quiet. Only downside was it's isolated from restaurants (but that's to be expected as it's so close to the airport).,4,2016,10,28
249,Pleasantly surprised ,"Having read a lot of awful reviews about this hotel wasn't sure what to expect!Got two twin rooms they were both nice and clean,the temperatures were just right and all the staff we came in contact with were very helpful even when we needed a few extras.It is also not too far from the shopping centre and easy to get into the city from there.If you don't have a ride the airport hopper goes straight from the airport to the hotel and back.",4,2016,10,27
249,Wedding party weekend experience,"My and my partner had our wedding locally in Angersrest (Strawberry Beds, Chapelizod, Dublin 20) on the 23rd of September just gone. Now that we are back after our honeymoon and are catching up with ourselves I'd like to write my review based on my experience. 

Planning our wedding at a venue that didn't accommodate one of our considerations was of course where we'd suggest our party stay. We decided on the Clarion Hotel as it's that bit cheaper (we know being a guest at a wedding can be expensive so we wanted to keep that cost down).

We made contact well in advance and understood we couldn't block book rooms (which is fair enough) but reserved a few rooms for ourselves. The kind lady we first spoke to even assured us an upgrade to a bridal suite which was fantastic. Unfortunately, this didn't happen and having explained that we were the wedding couple...couldn't even assure a room for early check-in...as we were traveling from the midlands and had a lot to do in the venue before getting dressed into suits. When we did arrive at the hotel we were given a most basic room overlooking the N4 when many of our wedding guests were given upgrades (this was a shame as we had brought many bookings in for them).

Our experience in the hotel was fine as we didn't use any of the facilities but I want to highlight something that happened to me at the bar on our wedding night when we returned from the venue. There was a bit of an altercation caused by one of the other guests when I told him I didn't have a wife but I have a husband instead (he was very drunk with his mates and was asking where my wife was)...this lead to a few homophobic comments which I ignored and didn't engage with. I was a bit annoyed and felt some shame that this behavior still happens when you're out minding your own business and enjoying yourself (plus, it was my wedding night...could it be any worse lol). Anyway, the next night the bar manager offered me two drinks on the house as the way of an apology as he witnessed the incident himself. He told me he saw me handling it myself and didn't want to get involved or cause a scene (fair enough I suppose). I would like it brought to the manager's attention though that later the same night when I went to use the restroom I had to again leave as I was about to be confronted by these same guys again who wanted to engage in conversation. As I said to the bar manager the following night (when he gave me two drinks on the house) that it wasn't his fault...or the hotels fault and not to worry. What does bother me now is that the bar manager on duty should have a better experience in dealing with situations like this that may often escalate throughout the night. I am a paying guest there and I should feel safe. I can handle myself pretty well but in a confined space with 3 drunken strangers (who I was previously involved in an altercation which through no fault of my own)...things could have come out a lot worse.

I also want to highlight that, weeks before the wedding I had been in contact with people in conference and events (3/4 phone calls) looking for them to get back to me with a price to feed 35 of our wedding party the following day. For whatever reason someone didn't bother to return my calls and that cost you at least a €1000 as we went over to Lemongrass (who even offered us personalized menus...they couldn't have been any better).",3,2016,10,27
249,Pleasant stay,"The ligation of this hotel is never going to rock your world, but I is convenient to the airport and for travelling to see sites outside Dublin. Room was large but for me, the best thing was the good pool and gym. Staff wee pleasant and efficient.",4,2016,10,27
249,Cheap n Cheerful place,"Went on weekend break, amazing comfort for the price I paid. Staff so friendly. As near motorway, easier to go to town centre by car n bus. Spa facilities n swim m, zaccuzi n sauna was refreshing. Lovely memories Kish ",4,2016,10,26
249,Business,"I stay here every now and again for work. I have stayed in all types of rooms in this hotel but my 5* excludes the rooms on the ground floor as they are on noisy communal corridors.
The executive suites are worth the extra money as you get your own living room, balcony and kitchen area + are in quiet area of hotel. + a pullout sofabed if you decide to bring someone or your other half snores ;)

The asian restaurant was nice. 1 main and a pint of coke was about €18 ish.

For business travellers i defo urge walking over to the liffey valley shopping centre as there are loads of restaurants incl Nandos and TGIs. Get a nandos card if your work pays for your food regularily so you can accrue free meals for your days off ;) 

Reception are great and friendly
Breakfast is a good - hotel buffet
Parking is €6 overnight
Off licence next door
Handy to M50
Casual atmosphere

Sweet little number for work or shopping.

Enjoy :)",5,2016,10,26
249,Need more staff,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The rooms were comfortable enough, however the walls are like paper and you can hear everything.
Restaurant was not great, never seemed to be enough people to serve everyone, and breakfast left a lot to be desired. In fairness they were really busy but compared to a lot of busy hotels i have stayed in they struggled.
There is a cinema and few restaurants about 10 minute walk away, and taxis in quick supply. ",3,2016,10,25
249,Has everything you need ,We enjoyed a great weekend at this hotel as the hotel had everything we needed to simply relax. Location is great with a nearby shopping centre that has loads of shops and lots of restaurants with even more opening shortly. Hotel staff are great and always available to help. We had breakfast at the hotel and although the Sunday was a bit chaotic there was always plenty of choice with everything being nice and fresh. Breakfast room could probably invest in a new toaster as this slows everything down during busy periods. Pool area is great with everything you need to relax. Only issue with the hotel is that you have to pay for your parking. One of the only hotels we ever stay in where you need to pay for this. Overall this is a great hotel and worth staying at,4,2016,10,25
249,One night stay,"Disappointed, very disorganized staff, paid a 50€  refundable cash deposit for each room on arrival despite me securing with my credit card, booked two rooms at same Time yet on arrival we were on different floors miles apart, confusing layout, would think twice about staying again or recommending to friends or family",2,2016,10,24
249,Typical business hotel,"This hotel is a typical business hotel near the motorway. It is not practical if you don't have a car , because coming and going to the hotel might be an issue. No easy public transportation nearby. The hotel is pretty busy. Breakfast could be a rush hour. The gym and pool are large and better than average, because it is also open for external guests. The hotel is spread over a large area, so walking could be an issue for elderly people.
",3,2016,10,19
249,Avoid if you can,"The rooms lack air conditioning or controllable heat. The hotel is geared towards coach tours. The expensive breakfasts is a poor quality buffet. The main restaurant is marked by shambolic service from both front of house and serving staff.

I stay here because it is close to where I work in Dublin.  It is its only saving grace.",2,2016,10,18
249,Good hotel in a great location,"This hotel is not in the centre of town, but it is ideally situated for the airport, for trips to the city and as a base from which you can plan a road trip to explore Ireland.

The facilities are superb and include a spa. There is a choice of dining - we chose the restaurant for our evening meal and found the quality of the food and the service to be top quality. The all-you-can-eat breakfast was also of good quality, although my partner did have to wait a while for her special order of a poached egg. When it arrived though, it could not be faulted.",4,2016,10,18
249,Two nights away with great friends,"Great hotel just a 10min ride from centre, arrived at hotel booked in by bernie, who seemed new but as he was trying to find our booking, he answered the phone and took another booking. Not good service !!!!

But was booked in by another lovely young lady. Lovely clean rooms, every thing we needed, tea and coffee in rooms,

One of the managers Kiren, wow what out standing services, he could not do enough for us, from bringing us menus passing the time if day with us, to making sure we had seats on Saturday night to see the live band in hotel.

We had so much fun up dancing, singing. Great fun.

We would stay there again, making sure we see the band again.",4,2016,10,18
249,Disappointing,"We were given an apartment thankfully so we were away from the main hotel. The apartment was clean and modern and very spacious.
The clientele at the hotel was a little intimidating. While we were waiting for a taxi outside, 3 20-30 year old men were drinking and jeering at us (3pm in the day), at 6pm, upon our return a bloody faced man (clearly after being in a fight), came up and into the hotel talking and behaving aggressively.
There were people wandering the hotel in dressing gowns, at breakfast also.
Breakfast was very disappointing. No table service, a domestic (non-industrial) 4 slice toaster that took 5 mins to toast bread, I asked for and was told there were no teaspoons or small milk jugs, so had to make my tea with a dessert spoon and a glass of milk from the bar. The bar area was generally untidy, dirty tables from the previous guest (crumbs etc.).
It is a pity as the hotel has serious potential, but the apparent need for security should be addressed. I believe this hotel is being used for long term housing (so I've been told since my stay), not that this makes any difference but I made the effort to be presentable in public and paid a lot for the pleasure of it, so I would expect that others do the same and the hotel should insist upon this too asking guests not to wear night clothes in the bar/ restraint/ front areas and address any harassment and intimidation of guests.",2,2016,10,18
249,Great Value,"I stayed Here in Sept 2016. Had two double rooms booked for two nights and got upgraded to two suites. Lovely pool for granddaughters. One grand daughter wasn't booked in but hotel had no problem with her sleeping on couch and offered an extra bed for her, but we declined. Playground just outside our suite.
Breakfast wasn't superb but adequate. Staff very friendly and helpful. Will visit again",5,2016,10,18
249,Very good hotel with easy road access to city centre and north or south of city for tourist visits.,"We stayed for three nights and found the easy access and parking excellent for a hotel in a major city.  It is few miles from the centre but this can be reached by car in about 20 minutes. It is within walking distance of a large and very high quality shopping centre and cinema which provides a wide variety of entertainment. The hotel is very comfortable, staff very helpful, rooms very clean, quiet and comfortable and service is good quality. The food is generally good and on the one occasion our son was offered a dish that was clearly over-cooked and dry, the staff readily agreed not to charge for this. Overall we will stay again due to the convenience, comfort and cleanliness of this nice hotel which provides good value for money in what can be a very expensive city to visit.",4,2016,10,17
249,Excellent and corteous service,"Visited the Clarion due to a day long conference. I don't know if it's been done up lately but it is looking much fresher than I remembered a few years ago.There's a spacious and fully equipped conference room which can take about 150 guests. Chairs are comfortable, an important detail if you have to sit the whole day. Fresh tea and coffee facilities were on offer at breaks. Cooked lunch was served at midday and was of a reasonable quality, a bit above pub lunch quality. The young restaurant manager was corteous and kind and went out of his way to accomodate you. Bar staff were also extra kind and as we arrived a bit late for lunch we were trailing behind. After lunch, barstaff made us coffee or tea to go and treated us to fresh biscuits. Hadn't expectes the extra personal touch from a hotel hosting our conference.Thanks!!

249,Saturday - one night stay.,"On arrival we were checked in by a very friendly Trainee. She had some difficulty finding our booking. No assistance was offered by the gum chewing second member of staff in the reception desk. Not a good first impression.                                       We were surprised we were charged €6.00 for parking especially as this hotel is not city centre and the adjacent Liffey Valley Shopping Centre does not charge for parking.                                                                                                                     We were offered breakfast for €13.50 per person but we felt this was over priced as we were adjacent to a shopping centre with a choice of restaurants. (We were delighted we had decided to forgo breakfast when we saw the long queue in the morning)                                                                                                             Without explanation we were told we had been upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. We were directed out the front door and along a pathway in the rain! While the bedroom in the suite was beautiful - spotlessly clean and comfortable the suite itself was bleak - wide expanses of bare walls, very grubby, uncomfortable soft furnishing and cushions.  A dirty stained carpet in the entrance. A fan with electrical flex rolled around it in the corner. Tall light shades with the light bulbs hanging below the shades. Table and chairs, coffee table and side table looked cheap. These are not 4 star furnishings. More student accommodation.                                               All the advantages of a suite were negated by the fact that all pots, pans and cooking utensils had been removed from the kitchen.                                              The childrens pool was lovely but the main pool at a consistent 1.4M dept would not suit older children who were not confident in the pool.                                           While we were disappointed with our visit - more 3 star v 4 star experience I would ask the hotel not to 'upgrade' 60+ customers to suites I feel if we had been in the main hotel we would not have had such a bad impression. With a family wedding coming up in 2018 I invited my daughter to the hotel. She felt it was far too busy and unattractive.",3,2016,10,16
249,NO SLEEP ,"we stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of October , and it's was very difficult to sleep as the noise from other guests outside and around the bar area went on till after 3am in the morning , the hotel is miles away from anything and the breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo ",2,2016,10,13
249,Fantastic Customer Service,"Sharon O was our server for 3 days during our stay at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley.  She was always available to answer questions & had a smile on her face. She was extremely customer focused while also being accessible & very friendly. We couldn't have asked for a better server. 

I would also like to commend the morning
Barista who made cappuccinos that were both delicious & beautiful. ",5,2016,10,13
249,Suites are not great,"If you're staying here try and make sure you are in the hotel and not in the building next door which they call the Suites
I just arrived and the first suite they gave me the lights wouldn't work.
They moved me to another suite which was very cold upon arrival and the seal on the windows is clearly very old as the noise of the traffic outside is monotonous",3,2016,10,12
249,Lovely Stay,"Myself and my partner stayed here for 2 nights. This was my first time to Dublin. The Hotel was situated 20 minutes on the bus from the city centre which cost around 3 euros each way. If you will be traveling to the centre of Dublin, I would recommend that you purchase a bus hopper ticket so this way you will save money.
The Hotel was clean and friendly. This is what we would have expected for the money we paid.  We did not dine in the hotel as spent our days in the City Centre. The health spa was a nice little treat, with a steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi.
We even joined in with the Aqua Aerobics and the regulars were really friendly.

The bus stop is around a 10 minute walk to the dual carriageway and all buses go straight to the centre.",4,2016,10,12
249,Fantastic stay,I stayed here with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved it.. the staff could not have been more helpful.. The receptionist kindly changed our room to a double room after I had accidently booked a twin room without any hassle. The gusto restaurant was amazing with a lovely atmosphere and Rebecca couldn't have looked after us better!! Vinicius in the bar was excellent and there is a great selection of cocktails on the menu!!  Great value for money! We will definitely be recommending this hotel !! Thanks,5,2016,10,10
249,Truly International,"We stayed here for a 21st birthday weekend as Dublin city centre was to pricey. Whole hotel  was immaculately clean,  staff incredibly helpful, decent breakfast and a swimming pool sauna and jaccuzzi what more would you need ? i must admit the hotel is on a busy motorway and I wouldn't have been too happy if we had been placed in a roadside room however we were in 365 which was quiet enough. Going   Into Dublin the bus stop was  a short walk away however the taxis mostly charged 20-25 euros which wasn't much more than the bus for 4 people so we used the taxis.There's also a shopping mall approx ten minutes walk away where you can purchase the usual take away type food such as KFC or Mcdonalds in the upstairs food court with downstairs being some super shops. 
My only complaint is when I phoned for room service I was quoted 5 euros for delivery and no where on the literature does it say that, so I walked down to collect my food.... .
The girls spoke to several of the staff about going out and about in Dublin after midnight and found Paddy Mooney from the bar took the time to tell them where best to go .. literally ! a good time was had by all and we would return which is a bonus.",5,2016,10,10
249,Big Hotel far from the city centre !!!,"This big hotel offers two restaurants and a beautiful hall. In the hotel there are some games for the children. Some rooms are not soundproof. They should be renewed.  It is far from the city centre.  The international breakfast was good. 
Our stay was pleasant!!!",3,2016,10,09
249,Its gone downhill,We used to love this hotel .but was dissapointed when we stayed there recently . The room was freezing like the a/c was on .we asked for heater but never got one .the room was right next to building site which started bout 7.30 am.we paid in full when we checked in but we still had to pay a €50 deposit on top of that which we never had to do before or do that anywhere else .i dont think its a 4 star hotel anymore unfortunetly.,2,2016,10,09
249,Disappointed with the accommodations ,"We booked the room for myself and fiancée and my three year old son, the first room we where landed with was on the first floor (room 355 a mile away from reception which would be fine if my fiancé hadn't a disability) which was overlooking a very busy and noisy building site, when I asked what time the building stops to reception they decided to move me which I wasn't to persistent on. To room 248 ground floor directly next to the main car park. (Which costs 6€ per night to anyone staying!! On top of what you've already payed) Cars where driving directly at our window lights on as they do at night turning right and proceeding to exit. With a three year olds first time trying to stay in the hotel it was torture. Breakfast was ok, food was good enough and coffee came in its own individual pot which I liked but it was freezing in the restaurant, it was if they had the a/c on cold to get people in and out faster. 
Overall food was good, rooms where very poor and it felt like staff where to busy to care and have a proper thought towards where they where putting my family. ",2,2016,10,07
249,Lovely hotel,"The Liffey valley is 15 mins from the airport & accessible via the shuttle bus (€9) but is a bit of a distance outside Dublin City but is served by a good bus service. You'll need a good pair of walking shoes, bus stops are about 10 mins walk from the hotel. Hotel bedroom is spacious & beds are very comfy. There are plenty of towels, tea, coffee, ironing board, hairdryer & fridge in all rooms. The telly is a descent size & room has a desk & chair. Restaurant in the hotel offers a choice of food and there are restaurants nearby. The Liffey valley shopping centre is about 10 - 12 mins walk away. I'd recommend this hotel.",4,2016,10,06
249,Good stuff,"Clean room, good breakfast, it is far from Dublin however we had a vehicle. Close to Liffey valley mall. Check in and out was prompt, even let us store our luggages pre/post check inn/out.

Parking is $6 euro.
",5,2016,10,03
249,Negative staff.,"Stayed here last night for family gathering. Happened to coincide with Dublin Mayo replay so hotel very busy but found most of the bar staff to be extremely unhelpful and negative and seemed to go out of their way to ensure that we did not enjoy our stay.
Music played in bar must have been way above health and safety decibel regulations. I asked could the music be turned down... was told no. We went, therefore, to the foyer with our drinks. Most people, I think, had the same idea as it was impossible to have any type of conversation. As all the seats in the foyer were taken with people who, I imagine, wanted to keep their eardrums intact, I asked could we sit in the restaurant with our drinks. Was told no until I asked for the manager who begrudgingly let us stay....until they turned off the lights!
Went back to bar but still too loud so sat in the corridor which was freezing cold. Eventually loud music stopped and we sat down to watch the Ryder Cup....but after about two minutes the  channel was changed. A couple of us asked could the channel be changed back...the answer, you've guessed it, was no! We were told they were setting up for breakfast and we had to move to the front bar but were told the TV there was broken. This all happened between 10 and 11.30pm on a Saturday night, by the way, and we were residents.
My brother then went up to the TV and turned it on, where, miraculously it was working...leading me to believe the staff just wanted us out of their hair. 
Unbelievable. 
Stayed in apartment which was nicely furnished but bad sleep as next to busy roads. Had to get two beds into it too as when we arrived at 9pm, they weren't there.
Never again.",2,2016,10,02
249,The saving grace was the bed!,"Myself and my partner stayed last night at this hotel. We were attending an event at the 3 Arena.  

My daughter rang to enquire if we needed to drive through the M50 toll to get to the Arena and was advised not, however when we arrived and asked for directions to  avoid the toll no one was able to help and the sat nav took us back through the toll!

This set the tone for our stay, we found the staff unhelpful on several occasions, for example my partner attempted to get change both at reception and at the lobby coffee shop but was refused.

We also discovered there was a parking fee, a fact the hotel fails to mention in it's booking information! 

The bar area is very run down, the bath in our room was badly chipped and the instant coffee provided was very poor quality. 

The breakfast was mediocre and my partners was cold. The coffee at breakfast was served in pots but because of the aircon in the dining room it was stone cold by the time we got to the second cup and the orange juice was warm.

The only saving grace was the bed! It was fabulous and the pillows were beautiful. I had the best nights sleep ever! It was the bed and the bed alone which got this hotel it's mark, however sadly on it's own it is not enough to warrant a return visit.",3,2016,09,29
249,Events ,I've had a few family events in this hotel and stay in it occasionally it is an outstanding venue food & service  is top class the staff & management can't do enough for u & they are very honest to their guests as I have left personal thugs behind on two occasions and they found them & was returned to me just love this hotel ,5,2016,09,28
249,"Noisy, poor quality","This is a dowdy, tired hotel that needs investment.  There's a major building project next door with noise that starts early.  Service is indifferent and the quality of the rooms and public areas is poor.",1,2016,09,26
249,Great value break,"This is my third time to stay here. It's a great hotel with excellent service and very friendly staff. It's a great overnight stay, right beside the shopping centre and cinema. I went with my daughter and we shopped, saw a movie and had dinner after in Gusto's at the hotel which I can highly recommend. A lovely weekend. Well worth a visit. Bed, breakfast and dinner package is very good value.",4,2016,09,26
249,Uncomfortable beds!!,Hotel was used for a wedding we stayed for.  The bed felt like cardboard and the room was semi-clean.  The walls were pretty marked up and the curtains were dirty.  I simply would not stay again because the beds were so uncomfortable!!,2,2016,09,26
249,A very nice Hotel for a relatively good price,"A splendid hotel to stay for few nights. Excellent rooms size, clean and comfortable, a nice restaurant where you can get a good breakfast. The staff in this hotel are welcoming and professional in their approach to the guests. Regretfully, reception is too small and not well mended, which can cause long queues when booking in and booking out. The reception staff seemed to me a bit stressed and overworked, which may have an effect on the way they are dealing with the gusts. 

The hotel location is well-suited people on their business trips, but a bit too far for travellers who are aiming to visit Dublin for more than a day.",4,2016,09,25
249,Felt more like a motel,"We felt very let down with this hotel. We was using this hotel as a place to stay for a wedding we was going to.

I will starting with what was good. The room was kept clean and it had a good shower. Having a fridge & safe in the room was a great inclusion. The staff were very friendly and tried to sort any issues.

Now to the reason why the low mark. We had a ground floor room, the view from this room was most days blocked by coaches parking in front of the windows, about 3 feet away! 

We tried to pre book a taxi a couple of hours before, this was refused by the hotel, we had to book when needed. We gave ourselves 1.5 hours even though journey was only 15mins, the taxi took 50mins to come despite being told was 10 mins away. If we had left to the last minute we would have been late for the wedding!

The WiFi is advertised as being available in every part of the hotel, it was but only just and very intermittent. The most we managed was 1 bar on signal strength from our room. For around 50% of the time we had no signal at all.

We ate once in the resturant for breakfast which was a buffet. This is as per most hotels and I enjoyed the food. They did however manage to get the only part of the order wrong, we received Tea not Coffee. The waitress did rectify this but I was then given a replacement cup which had a hugh chip in it, around half inch long and stained brown! From then on we ate elsewhere, the Arc resturant down the road was very good.

",2,2016,09,25
249,Great for business,I have stayed in this hotel on a few occasions in the last few months but never got round to writing a review. I must say from the moment you enter the quality of service I always receive is very good. My most recent visit I got a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The free wifi on offer is very good for working and the hotel for Dublin is very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this hotel for both the business or pleasure traveller,5,2016,09,24
249,Lovely staff,"Breakfast was excellent , staff were very friendly especially Natalie in the Kudos Bar/Restuarent.  Room was quiet as requested, very comfy bed.overall a very relaxing stay in sept close to Liffey valley shopping center.",4,2016,09,22
249,Breakfast let it down,"Just an overnight stay for us. The reception staff were friendly and efficient, the family room had a single and camp bed along with the double, all good. There was little noise from outside the room and we all slept well.

There was no wifi in our room but there was free wifi in reception and some other areas of the hotel. For a 4*, I would expect free wifi in the rooms.

The shower had some mildew on the tiles, blackened grout. minor issue but again a 4* hotel.

My gripe would be the breakfast. Plenty of food, just not very appetising. No apple juice, no fried eggs, pastries were hard.

To the IT/Marketing staff, get the hotel location registered with google maps. It leaves you are the round about just off the main road and there are no sign posts (that I saw) to the hotel from there.",3,2016,09,21
249,Way past expectations.,"Stayed as a family in early September.Staff were efficient & friendly.Standouts were the guy on the coffee station who took the time to explain bowlers coffee to me and recommended some places to visit in the city.
Housekeeping were amazing, on returning to our room not only were the beds made but all the children toys were arranged on the bed, bathroom and desks were organised and shoes placed neatly together etc.I did not expect that level of personal service and certainly have not seen it Hotels with room rates four times higher than Clarion.
Breakfast was as expected however one server really went out of her way to strain the orange juice for our daughter who doesn't like ""bits'.On a very busy service it was wonderful that she would make the time to do this.A good hotel with some amazing staff, thanks.....",4,2016,09,19
249,Home away from home,"Loved the staff at the Clarion! It's what all Dublin hotels should aspire to be like. When the girl at reception checked us in, she was very welcoming and friendly, she didn't even bat an eyelid when our check in was rudely interrupted by other guests! She was lovely to them even though in my opinion they were just plain rude, she was very efficient and took care of them while not making us feel ignored. Unfortunately I didn't check her name badge as I would have liked to have named her here. All the staff were friendly throughout the hotel. The room was very homely very clean with everything we needed, I like the whole vibe of the hotel as well. Only a couple of things are needed to make this Hotel perfect! There was no option that I could see to have breakfast in the room, so that was a little annoying as I hate overcrowded dining rooms in the morning. The bar itself was very large, open and quite cold. It needs warming up, I know it's used as an eating area as well as a bar but a few comfortable booths would be lovely, it would break up the huge open space. That been said the food was lovely, we ate In Kudos which was lovely, when I go back again to stay I will definitely try the Italian restaurant Gustos as it looked a beautiful place to dine in.",4,2016,09,17
249,Not advised for business stay,"I won't advise the hotel for business stay. They have very limited continental breakfast. No machine to get a cappuchino. On one day the yogurt was out, after waiting 5 minutes for refill, they told me that there was no refill anymore.  Bad sound isolation, you will hear every door slam of neighbouring rooms, bad sleep is no good if you have to be fit at work next day. Next to that it is far outside the center, not good  if you want to have  business diner closeby.  The reception was helpful to explain how bus worked but did not tell that the busdrivers were on strike after 9pm , so the cheap bus ticket of Eur 2.70  became expensive taxibill.",3,2016,09,17
249,"Terrible service, long queues. Personal items missing from room.","I was very excited to be staying in the clarion hotel for a few weeks on business. I previously enjoyed the Clarion in Limerick but I could not wait to be finished with my stay.

Firstly, you have to deal with long queues, at check in and breakfast is the worst. They do have a board telling you of peak times but even at 6am and all I want is a glass of Orange juice and you still have to queue to get into the breakfast area. 

I often came home from a long day at work to find my access card wouldn't  activate my bedroom door (this happened nearly everyday one week, and I always kept my card away from my mobile to prevent this) and then you had to queue all the way at the back after a bus load of people!

On my first week they had me located on the bottom floor near reception. I barely got any sleep with people chatting down the hall or kids screaming or hearing luggage rolling. Usually from my experience longer staying guests were placed in quite areas of the hotel but no, the second week I was located next to a building site! 

My biggest issue was when I reported my missing work vouchers from my room. 3 months worth of vouchers were taken from my room. They can be used by anyone and unfortunately the company I work for cannot trace the booklet they gave me. These vouchers were for my personal use only to get uniform. Now some cleaner or whoever is out their selling my vouchers for profit or taking advantage herself. 

When I highlighted it to reception, they took note of it and I specifically asked them to contact me on my mobile whether they heard anything or not. I knew well I wouldn't get the vouchers back but a courtesy call is all I wanted. For the manager to contact me, tell me what action he took and perhaps apologise? Oh no.. I still haven't heard anything from the manager. 

A few days after I reported the stolen vouchers I did bring it up to a girl in reception. She replied ""Oh your the girl who THINKS her vouchers went missing...an email was sent around to everyone""
Wow, amazing... an email? Did someone own up via email about stealing from my room? Ridiculous.

So anyway the company I work for who use the clarion on a regular basis will be now looking for other accommodation for future employees. Big.Loss.

On a final note, the thai restaurant is vile don't get me started on what the chef does to the sweet chilly sauce. Looks disgusting- he needs to stop putting that white stuff in the centre of it.

Only marks I'm giving to is the Gusto resturant where the food is very tasty. 
I will never stay their again and will be recommending friends and family the same.

Anyone reading this, the Louis Fitzgerald  is nearby, much cheaper, friendlier and I love Joel's resturant next to it. My advise is to stay there!
",2,2016,09,17
249,Building work,"We have just stayed here and At the moment there is some building work going on behind the hotel. It would have been nice to have been told this by reception when we arrived  . The work started around 7.45am  which would be ok if you were just using this hotel for business and  not for pleasure . 
The shower which is over the bath has a shower head which does not move which means you have to get so close to the taps for a shower and  is not practical.
On a plus side the new Gusto Italian restaurant is very good and the food is delicious.",3,2016,09,16
249,25/75,"Must say this hotel was somewhat below average. Stopped for a 2 night break easy to get to from the city centre bus number 25a stops less than a 5 -10 mins walk but an 10 -15 mins walk to get an bus back to the city centre. Good location 5 -10 mins walk to get to the massive Liffey Valley shopping centre. With many options should like to pop out for a meal. We had an suite which was a bonus great size with breakfast included. The hotel has a swimming pool too an added bonus again. The breakfast was the highlight, really enjoyed the great selection available. However, the downsides to the stay out weight the good points.  During breakfast we had no milk on our table so I asked for some milk, and was given an half used milk jug picked up from the neighbouring table with food stains clearly visible on jug, I didn't expect that. The room cleanliness was very disappointing, the room was cleaned very poorly the used towels where rolled back up and left to be reused, still damp the bed was not made left as it was. No mini bar or bottled water available in the suite rooms. To request bottled water there is a service charge of 5 euros added on to cost of water. The air conditioning was not operating very warm rooms. No toiletries in bathrooms, did have an shower gel only 1/5 full and same for the hand moisturiser, nothing else. Found KY jelly in the suite kitchen, it's still there... Proves how bad the team of cleaners the hotel posses. Upon check in was incorrectly directed to my room, could not locate room on signs available by the lifts so returned to reception and was told our room is on the outside of the hotel again I don't expect that from staff to make an error of such nature. But I'm sure this all is all just my bad luck. There is potential for improvements to be made. ",3,2016,09,15
249,Surprised ,"Actually fairly surprised by this one. TBH wasn't expecting much. However decor, Food and especially service was all above standard. 
It's location is so handy though. Straight out to the m50 which is why I booked our colleges in there. All very happy with their stay 
Will be back
",4,2016,09,15
249,Top Class,"Stayed there for weekend with my wife and two young kids weekend of 9th September.

I loved everything about the hotel from start to finish.

Family friendly, very clean throughout. Great food which was reasonably priced.

Staff and management were very helpful friendly and considerate.

We all loved the pool and great to see that unlike some other hotel pools, it was nice and warm.

We ate there the 2 nights, Friday in Gusto's and Saturday in Kudos. No complaints there, hats of to the chefs and waiting staff.

Was a little dissapointed that there was only one craft beer available on the Friday night and none on Saturday. 

We will be back.",5,2016,09,14
249,1 night stay,"Booked a family room on line but found out afterwards we would have got it at a better price if we had booked it with the hotel directly.  Lovely room, good food, enjoyed the swimming pool and secure car parking and close to shopping centre/cinema if you want to hit the shops!!
Only downside was the room was too hot-even with the window open and the fan provided in the room on-too hot to sleep. Asked other guests in the pool the next morning and they said they were too hot too. No heatwave in dublin at the time so cant figure why rooms were so hot. 
Would like to go back there but heat of room would put me off.",3,2016,09,13
249,They care about Customer Satisfaction!,"All staff were keen to assist and accommodate me from my iniitial call from London, to reception, to my room. Polite, welcoming, warm and it felt that nothing was too much trouble for them.   
 
There are indoor play facilities for children with an adjacent social seating area; a room for table games (i.e. air hockey, pool) ...yet still a quiet hotel. Vending machines for snacks and drinks on each floor. A huge reception/lounge area.

Cafe, restaurant, room service menu are all great!  ...Oh, the fitness center is outside of the main hotel building, but immediately adjacent to it.

I am soooooo going back there.  Thank you CLV

Big shout out to Deniyi and Ashleigh  on reception #A*

Bus service from Dublin airport delivers you to the entrance door of this hotel.  
15 minute ride at most. Cost about £14/15 return journey (each).",5,2016,09,13
249,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"My partner and I stayed here for a couple of nights during our trip to Dublin. 

While a bit far away from the town centre if you don't drive, the hotel itself was very nice; the rooms were clean and had tea/coffee facilities, hairdryer, iron, and mini fridge.

While the breakfast is good, it's best to go as early as possible as it gets very busy. We didn't have dinner here during our stay, so can't comment on the evening meals.

The best thing about this hotel in my opinion is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them, and they were so helpful when we asked for their advice about local travel.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,11
249,Would come again! ,"My boyfriend and I came to Dublin for his birthday weekend and stayed at the Clarion hotel! We were very impressed with the room and lovely comfy bed! The food at the restaurant is amazing and we were served by a lovely, helpful girl named Rebecca. She was a delightful and nothing was too much trouble! There is a bus route from the hotel to Dublin which only takes about 15 minutes. Very easy!! The receptionists are happy to help give directions to the bus stop! The pool was great and breakfast also lovely! 

The only reason for not giving the full 5 star is because of two reasons- number 1) there were 2 hairs in our bath on arrival and we are both blonde; the hair was black! Although I understand things can sometimes be missed and all it took to get rid of it was running the water. Number 2) we left the hotel at 10am and left out the 'please service our room' sign. We arrived back at 4:30pm and it still wasn't done. We received a knock on the door at 5pm asking if we still wanted it done, by then we just wanted to get showered and ready for dinner so said no. 

None the less I would 100% stay at this hotel again as staff are lovely and overall it has been a very pleasant stay. 

",4,2016,09,11
249,Ideal for families,"We had a poor experience a few years ago but after hearing about friends' positive experiences, we decided to try the hotel again and I'm delighted that we did. The staff are friendly & helpful. The rooms are spacious- we stayed in a suite (2 adults & 1 child) and the sofa bed was made up with pillows and a duvet on arrival. The room was warm as most hotels are but there were large fans in both rooms which made it comfortable to sleep and I appreciated that we didn't need to request them. The room had a small balcony (no furniture - not really enough space) but in addition to the normal lock on the door, there was a child lock high up which was much appreciated as that's where our son slept. Breakfast was busy but service was good and the selection was fine. It's not a luxury hotel but it is great value for money. Overall we were very happy with our stay and will stay again. ",5,2016,09,08
249,Double Booked and overcharged,"Although a staff member rang to confirm our booking on the evening of our stay, when we reached the hotel it was double booked and they had no room for us. we were offered a hotel further out from the city that was to be more expensive but the clarion would cover the cost.  When we reached our new hotel, we were suprised to find it was a 3 star, which we were not informed of, and it was cheaper than the clarion, however we got no refund!",1,2016,09,08
249,Will stay again,"Stayed here while attending a concert in Dublin, they upgraded us to a suite at no extra price and we loved it, dinner in the bar was nice the breakfast was lovely. Bus took forever to get into Dublin but a lot cheaper than a cab, by the looks of it this hotel gets a lot of bus tours so it busy place.",3,2016,09,07
249,Nice hotel,"Lovely hotel with great facilities. We had a good time, the meals were lovely. Staff were helpful and friendly. Their meeting rooms are nice and were very ideal for our meetings. The hotel is quite big and has free parking. It is very close to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and just two minutes drive from the M4 exit.",4,2016,09,07
249,Great hotel on the fringe of the city centre,"We stayed in the hotel for one night as it was near the highways to drive to the west of Ireland and didn't want  to face Dublin rush hour traffic. The hotel was everything we wanted. Nice size rooms, friendly staff, free parking, clean place. Beds were comfortable. We had a king size bed and a single in our room and paid for the basic room. Got a good deal booking online off a third party website. Would stay here again if need be but wouldn't stay here if I would be doing a lot of visiting around the city centre simply because of the location. Very satisfied overall. ",4,2016,09,06
249,weekend trip,"Myself and family had a brilliant time in Dublin Friday to Sunday, we had booked four single rooms but we got a suite each, the hotel had nice staff who were willing to answer any questions you had. Did a bus tour all over the city and the tour guide was excellent regarding information, the Guinness Tour was also excellent and you got a free drink at the end of the tour,bus stop was a ten minute walk from the hotel and plenty buses to take you into the city, Trinity College was also on our route, they had a hugh college game with students from Boston in the States so thousands of Americans in town which made for much excitement,plenty bars and food outlets to visit and excite your taste buds,plenty to see in the main thoroughfare. Only downside to our holiday break was being well overcharged from a taxi driver from the airport to our hotel, the driver didn't listen to where we were going so we paid for his mistake, My niece reviewed this hotel on TripAdvisor and it was stated taxi fare would be about 25 Euro from airport to our hotel, we were charged 40 euro so not a good start.We used taxis a couple of times and the fare was between 20-25 euro, apart from that a good trip.",5,2016,09,06
249,"Big hotel, lovely food.","I stayed here at the weekend for 3 days, 2 nights with my family. On arrival it was buzzing with so many people from all over the world which I love. The reception was quite slow and we noticed this the whole time we were there; Saturday morning there was only 1 person on reception with a very long queue of people trying to check out and catch a flight etc. Our room was lovely, no AC but there was a fan in the room which substituted for that. None of us slept very well as the beds were not that comfortable. We ate in the Italian restaurant both nights and weren't disappointed. Food was delicious and the staff remembered us and chatted away to us, very friendly and attentive people. Overall it was a lovely hotel, very big and more of a family with younger kids hotel, but ideal if you want a quiet and relaxing getaway.",4,2016,09,06
249,"Visit Dublin 22, Clarion hotel","Hi had a great time thanks to Stella and Monica showing me Farm Leigh Phoenix park and the bar staff at the Clarion Liffey Valley, Paddy the bar manager a man who knows his Guinness and Vinny from Rio. If you enjoy a good bed and a pint of the black stuff the Clarion and its staff will sort you out.
cheers Ian",5,2016,09,04
249,Good hotel for families,"Firstly, all staff we came across were exemplary: as we found is so typical for Dubliners, they all went out of their way to make whatever you wanted to happen -happen. So, a lack of deposit for lockers- no problem. A rule that DVD players couldn't be borrowed (because people continuously and unapologetically broke them apparently) was got around, probably at great effort. Special mention here to Martina on reception. Truly lovely lady- especially to our kids.

Good solid four star hotel otherwise. No frayed edges, lovely to be in.

It was also very good to be so close to the Liffey Valley mall. Enormous Vue cinema, M&S, Boots, Pizza Express (Milano) and Prezzo, amongst many other shops.

Downsides: not easy to get in and out of Dublin if you don't have a car. Hotel is about 20 minutes outside the centre of town  and another 10-15 minute walk from the bus stop. However, it was nice to be able to leave Dublin and it didn't bother us unduly.

One thing did though: the hotel has a lovely pool and we went there specifically for it. The pool is divided in half for lanes and family swimming. Fine. However, on two of the three times we went, the family area was unapologetically carved in two again by a private Waterbabies class whilst we were there. Most hotel guests with families were completely bemused by being crowded into a tiny area and it made it very unenjoyable. Presumably, the class could have used the baby pool, but didn't. This was all the worse as kids are prohibited from using all the other facilities in the pool area: the jacuzzi, the sauna and the steam room!

The hotel staff were so good, we forgot about the downsides and enjoyed the many upsides. I would highly recommend this hotel, but could the hotel make it clearer that there are limitations in families using the pool?

",4,2016,09,04
249,Handy base,"Had a nice stay at the Clarion. Family rooms decently sized, comfy beds.
Good facilities for families with kids but they seem to struggle when they are busy. Service was extremely slow in Gusto restaurant we had to repeatedly approach staff and ask for more drinks. Breakfast was chaotic and again had to approach staff to ask for cutlery and cups. They seem to struggle to manage but overall it's a clean hotel and handy to venture out on trips to the zoo and tayto park etc. Not central at all but perfect if you want to stay out of the centre, great shopping centre and cinema 2 minutes down the road.

",3,2016,09,04
249,Enjoy our stay,"Myself and husband arrived fri 2nd sept -4th sept, rooms very clean .. Breakfast had a great selection .. We ate on the fri night in kudos it was delicious and they had a €35 for two courses for two people which was very good Sat night we ate in Gusto the Italian .. Prices quite pricey but food was delicious,  I had the lasagne, rooms very big, only downfall was the heating, it was switched off but the room was still very hot during the night, could have opened a window but the motorway facing our window was very noisy so had to have it closed which resulted in us both waking up each morning with blocked stuffy noses and headaches , rooms aren't very soundproof either, we came for a relaxing break away from our young kids but were woken up with kids and babies in rooms next door crying and carrying on all night .. Would go again but would rather they put adults in beside adults and families together",4,2016,09,04
249,"Average hotel, pool closed no communication beforehand","Arrived at the Clarion on the 28th August for a 1 night stay having booked about 3 weeks beforehand only to find that the pool etc was closed for refurbishment.  Had booked this hotel purposefully due to location (headed to Tayto Park the next day) and wanted to treat my kids to a night away with a pool to play in.

The receptionist (Katrina) informed me that Lastminute.com hadn't forwarded my details on only my name for the booking but that just doesn't sit well with me.  If they knew I had booked through Lastminte then they should have contacted them to get the details and let me know as I would have changed my booking; I drove 4 hours to Dublin for this!

I've since tried to contact Clarion to complain, but there's no head office listed on their website and even if you try to tweet them they don't reply.  Lastminute also haven't bothered to reply to my complaint.

The room was very small for 4 people, and the car park costs €6 a night although that wasn't mentioned in our booking at all.

The only reason this is getting 2* and not 1* is because it was very clean and the staff we did encounter were friendly enough.

Free wifi.",2,2016,09,02
249,Not a four star hotel.,"After queuing to check in I was told our room wasn't ready (despite it being past the check in time). We were offered a cup of tea in the bar. After 45 minutes I came back to see if the room was ready. The queue to check in was out of the door and I was told I had to queue again. Another 30 minutes to queue and I finally checked in. There was a sign at reception stating that the pool was closed for three days. No apology or explanation from the staff. The only reason I booked this hotel was for the pool and I feel they should have contacted me to let me know so I could have made alternative arrangements. The room was fine and seemed clean, the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was ok. The rooms are very hot and despite having an air conditioning feed this wasn't switched on. Overall the hotel feels like it is being run on a budget. The staff are poorly trained in customer service and the hotel is a little grubby in the public areas. I would not stay here again.",3,2016,09,01
249,What do you want,"A good hotel that serves as a staging post. Rooms were nice and clean and  staff were family friendly. Parking is reasonable and location is fine...to get to someplace else. For the price point it's perfect, a decent breakfast set up for a nice day ahead.",4,2016,08,31
249,Trip of a life time,"Highly recommend this hotel, food staff and room was great. Mr. Patrick Mooney,  restaurant manager was wonderful.  Made our family feel so very welcomed to Ireland. Also very helpful helping us discover the Irish culture.

Thank you,
Dave and Kathy Burns August 2016y",5,2016,08,31
249,"Wonderful stay, great staff!","My family and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel.  Food is good, rooms are great. The restaurant manager, Mr. Patrick Mooney, also made a huge impact during our stay.  We had a long flight to Dublin and had arrived after the hotel restaurant had already closed.  He offered to call restaurants nearby on our behalf to have food delivered.  He really went out of his way to provide us a great experience.  Highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2016,08,31
249,Free upgrade :),"I stayed here for one night on a business trip by myself. I was a little overwhelmed when I arrived as it was extremely busy and there were guests everywhere, checking in and wandering around. But when I eventually got to the check in desk I was dealt with quickly and professionally. The main hotel seemed to have a lot of families in and I think it may have been because of this that I was given a free upgrade. I was given a suite just to the right of the hotel. It was a beautiful suite. I wished I'd been staying longer than 1 night! The only downside was the fact that the air-con wasnt working...but I did have a fan and windows and a balcony, so I can't complain.

I had dinner in the restaurant around 6pm which was the earliest I could book. I was starving! If you are put off by the noise of children, probably best you eat later. I have 3 of my own so wasnt bothered. Plenty of room and a nice atmosphere in there. The cannelloni I had was nice but wasnt amazing. Its was a bit like chain restaurant food, nice but not a great deal of flavour.",5,2016,08,31
249,Will NEVER return,"Booked this hotel for a family getaway. We had never stayed here before and will not be staying in he future. When we arrived, it took half an hour or more get checked in and then we were informed that the hotel pool was closed for maintenance, as this was one of the reasons we had booked, we were extremely disappointed. We were sent to another hotel and were then asked to pay to use it. Not impressed! We ordered dinner that night and our children had their food finished a good half hour before ours arrived on the table! The rooms were extremely warm and had no air con only a fan. Breakfast was chaotic and we queued again. When we got to the top of the queue we were asked to pay which we had already done the previous day. The information hadn't been given to the rest of the staff. There wasn't enough cutlery in the table, food choice was limited and when we asked for tea, the staff member was extremely rude. We had misplaced  something and the reception staff were appalling! Absolute disgraceful staff who need serious training in dealing with the public...will NEVER be returning.",1,2016,08,30
249,Cancel if you booked to use pool,"Booked to stay here for 2 days with my wife. Asked for quite room and was given noisiest beside building site. Requested switch straight away which was accommodated and new room was lovely. We left 2 young boys at home to get a break away but there were a lot of families here and had we brought the kids we would have definitely booked with the pool in mind as they love swimming. When we arrived 28th August we were told pool is closed for 3 days. No explanation given. We were not informed of this before booking. 
Breakfast is bland and noisy/busy with poor selection of food. No pastries, soda bread etc. Rooms are also very hot. All in all not very impressed and I don't have particularly high standards. Staff were indifferent bar one lad in restaurant for breakfast who was excellent. Reception staff need to be trained on what it take to be in a customer facing role. A smile goes a long way. Would not stay here again. Hotel is very busy and it seems like they get business regardless of reviews and therefore put no effort into addressing. ",2,2016,08,29
249,Another fab weekend at the clarion Liffey valley,"After staying in the clarion Liffey valley last year it was a no brainer to book again this year for an end of summer treat before the kids go back to school, while the rooms are nothing special they are clean and comfortable and there is more than enough going on in the hotel that you really are only in the room to sleep shower ect! Our kids love the kids club and the pool this year taking in a magic show a disco and movie night, also supervised swim sessions gave the adults a chance to relax in the hot tub :) the 2 on site restaurants serve good quality food at reasonable prices and the bar at the kudos restaurant is a nice place to unwind after a busy day while the kids play with the new friends they've made at the club! The bar has such a relaxed vibe nothing is to much trouble for the staff, we were well looked after by the bar manager Patrick and the kids just thought he was the coolest guy ever!! In short we had a fab time this weekend and would recommend this hotel to family's we intend to book the same weekend again next year for the third year running and hope Patrick and his team are still there to look after us as they made such a difference to our trip this year :)",5,2016,08,28
249,A great stay,"Stayed here with family on a 2 day deal which includef entry to Tayto Park. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. We all agreed the beds were amazingly comfy and had great nights sleep. It was warm but kept windows open and fans on. Breakfast was good. Plenty of choice and hot food tasty. We ate in Gustos both nights. First night food was great and staff attentive. Second night food not so good but alerted management to this and they agreed to waive bill. I would stay here again as kids had a great time at pool and other than issue with food on second night could not fault.
 ",5,2016,08,28
249,Mr Gordon Dickey,"My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights to take our 4 year old daughter to Dublin zoo. Upon entry we were greeted by an unbelievably long check in queue!! It took us 30 minutes to reach the reception desk, having a young child with us I find this totally unacceptable!!! Once we reached the desk the receptionist didn't even have the common decency to apologise for our long wait. The room itself was clean and spacious but without air conditioning. The heat was unbearable at night time resulting in quite an uncomfortable nights sleep. 
Having a child with us, the first thing she wanted to do was understandably go to the swimming pool. Entering the pool reception we were told we would have to wear pool hats supplied by the hotel at an extra charge of 3 euros, even charging for the child and that this was compulsory!! We begrudgingly handed over our 9 euro and proceeded to the pool. Once in the pool i was absolutely shocked to discover 2 dirty plasters floating around which I personally picked out and disposed of. Not only that, but I also noticed a teenage girl swimming around in her bra!! I find all this completely ridiculous whenever we were forced to wear pool caps for hygiene reasons!! 
The next morning we headed for breakfast. Set up as a buffet, the food itself was nice though the air conditioning blasting above our heads not only made our child freezing, it also made our food go cold very very quickly. I find this slightly ironic as there's not air conditioning in the rooms which is where it's needed the most!! Breakfast is shockingly over priced at €13.50. Though at reception you can opt for an inclusive package reducing that rate to €12.50. A whole euro difference!! Fantastic!!
Dinner in the restaurant was enjoyable although my girlfriend wanted the mussels only for the waitress to turn around and say 'we don't have any!!' Charming!! Yet again I found the whole dinning experience over priced for what you get. 
To sum up, in our experience this hotel should be a fair 3 star and NOT a 4 star which is what it proclaims to be. ",2,2016,08,26
249,Mediocre hotel.. with some great penthouse suites,"There are not many positive things to say about the hotel. Everything appears a little worn out, old carpets, crowded breakfast room, lack of service staff, cues at the reception and the breakfast, noisy (lots of kids).
However, the hotel seems to be quite popular--mostly for tourists visiting Ireland and Irish people on their way to or from vacation, most of them families with kids (to me it was a little peculiar to stay a night in a Dublin hotel prior to flying into vacations or coming back, Ireland is so small that the longest drive to Dublin Airport is not more than 4-5 hours). 
However, on the positive side: the hotel is close to the airport (20 min. by taxi) and there are buses to Dublin Centre (20 min.) with a bus stop in walking distance.
Most pleasant surprise where that I was booked in one of the penthouse suites on the 4th and 5th floor. They appear to have been just recently built, are spacious, comfortable, offer a living room as well as a small kitchen. If you are on a business trip--ask for those rooms. I have not seen the other rooms, but judging from the overall state of the hotel I would not expect to much from them.",2,2016,08,25
249,Rooms too hot,Having read reviews before coming to the hotel.  When people mentioned the heat in  room. I thought it wouldn't be too bad.  Unfortunately the heat was terrible. We had to have the stand alone fan on at all times and the windows open.  Very uncomfortable environment.  The breakfast was nice but trying to get tea and coffee was a struggle each morning.  The pool was lovely and the kids enjoyed it. The WiFi was excellent. The meal we had in the restaurant was great and staff friendly. I wouldn't stay here again due to the issue of no air conditioning in the rooms.,3,2016,08,25
249,"Enjoyable, convenient, clean","Stayed here for one night having visited Tayto Park and moving onto Dublin Zoo the next day. Location very convenient for both. Hotel is extremely busy however staff at front desk are very attentive and checked in in no time at all.  We didn't opt for dinner or breakfast in the hotel so cannot rate foodwise.  Room very clean, one double bed and one single bed, bathroom immaculate.  Tea & coffee making facility in the room was great.  We went accross to Milano in Liffey Valley for our evening meal and again had breakfast in the Liffey Valley Centre also.  I had anticipated a bad night's sleep seeing as the hotel so busy with a lot of families with children on our floor but I have to say it was one of the best night's sleep I have had. My husband and son availed of the pool next morning and thoroughly enjoyed. Overall very impressed and yes I would stay again.",4,2016,08,25
249,"Average room, disappointing service","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and on the initial impressions it looked like a good hotel. However things soon went downhill:

For an evening meal in the hotel bar 'Kudos' the food wasn't up to scratch. The 'best ever curry' was certainly a big misrepresentation. 

At check in we had pre-paid for breakfast.  So as a reasonable expection for 4 star rated hotel you would expect the staff to talk to each other and have a note of what rooms had ordered breakfast... apparently not as I had to go back to my room to get my receipt to prove I had paid for breakfast. After apologies from the staff I was promised that it wouldn't happen on the following day as they would make a note on the room. However unsurprisingly I had the same aggravation the following day.

Now on to the room, we had a TV in the room but there was no remote to be found. Disappointing for a 4 star hotel.

Furthermore the complimentary tea and coffee wasn't restocked when the housekeeping team came round. Not a major gripe but still something that you'd expect from a hotel of this standard.

Overall this should have been a good hotel but there was just problem after problem which was disappointing ",2,2016,08,24
249,Very nice,"Nice hotel, lovely warm swimming pool, food nice but no eurpean restaurant was v disappointing. Room nice and v clean hotel over all. Would stay again 
6euro per night in car park which I was not aware of when booking",4,2016,08,24
249,"Awful visit, won't be going back","I never normally complain about hotels, but I couldn't avoid it this time. 
I stayed here for 2 nights recently whilst my baby had to have an operation in Crumlin hospital. 
We asked for a cot in the room, and when it arrived I set it up and realised the base was faulty, had to ring twice to get someone to come up to change it.
On the first night I couldn't book a meal as the main restaurant was fully booked, so had to make do with the Asian restaurant. Unfortunately there was a christening on in the function room right beside us, with kids screaming and running round the while time we were in there. Made for a very uncomfortable meal. On top of that, the music was blaring from the christening and also the fire alarm went off twice in quick succession, scaring the life out of my baby boy.
That night in our room there was a room full of kids beside us who wouldn't stop chatting til 3am. The walls were paper thin, we had to ring reception to ask them to ring the person in the room on the other side aswell as his TV was keeping us awake. 
We went for breakfast on the second day (we only paid for breakfast on one morning as my boy was fasting for an operation on the first day) but had to queue for a good long while at 7:30am as the place was heaving with some of the coach tours, at least 15 of whom skipped the queue and went straight in ahead of us.
We were glad to be checking out, however after arriving home the same day that I checked out, I realised I had left a memory stick in the TV (to watch a show I had saved on it). I rang the hotel to get them to send it back, only to tell me it wasn't there. I definitely left it in the TV, so I'm not sure how it went missing, but it unfortunately topped off a highly miserable two night stay at the hotel, one which cost me over €240 for two nights with one breakfast for myself and my wife included.",1,2016,08,24
249,Noisy & hot,Stayed here recently with my family. Enjoyed most aspects of our stay including the free wifi but our room was looking out on a very noisy building site. The traffic noise is bad enough but add in the building site meaning you can't open the windows means a hot sticky night in a room with no ac. Once I got up to make sure the window wasn't open given how noisy it was. Disappointing as you want to have a lie in when you are on holidays.,3,2016,08,24
249,Nice stay,"We stayed here as a random quiet night away and I must say the staff are so nice and accommodating and helped us with anything that we needed during our stay. hotel itself is so clean, lovely hotel for a quiet break and would definitely recommend it to anyone.",4,2016,08,24
249,Good enough short break,"Spent 2 nights in this hotel staying in 2 bedroom apartment with my wife and 4 children. Very impressed with the apartment. Huge living space as well as 2 generous bedrooms and bathrooms. Also included kitchen, dishwasher, microwave and washer dryer. Only negative was kitchen poorly equipped with only 4 plates, cups, bowls, and 4 of each cutlery. A few dishwasher tabs would have made a difference also. Website could do with more information on accommodation and facilities in these apartments.

Pool was enjoyed by all the family. Didn't eat in the restaurant at night - need to book in advance for this. Breakfast was ok, on our second morning they ran out of pastries/croissants by 9.30am but porridge and cooked breakfast was good.

Overall we enjoyed our stay, would book the apartment again. Place beginning to show its age a bit and in need of some updating in places.",4,2016,08,23
249,Great Location,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights with my husband and 2 children (5) . Arrived after a day spent in the zoo which is about 15 minutes drive away (if traffic is moving )check in was very quick. 

Our room was quite spacious but as my children were quick to point out the lack of a table and chairs in the room. Room was very clean. 

Breakfast was served in a large airy room with an array of options I am sure would suit everybody. During rush hour an Kudo's Bar was opened for breakfast. 

Location is great for the City- the number 25 bus from across the carriageway (5 mins walk) brought us right into the city center in 30 mins approx.

2 mins drive / 10 minute walk brings you to the liffey Valley Shopping center which has a huge choice in dining options and plenty of shops. We even went to the Cinema.  

There is a kids club here during school hols @ €5 per session

The Swimming pool here is really nice with a seperate kids pool. Children are only allowed between 10am and 7pm. 

Staff are cheerful and helpful

Will definitely return here- good value and great location",4,2016,08,23
249,more of a creche,"we stayed two night our room smelled room service only clean the rooms every third day .
lots of children running wild no supervision ,no quiet area to sit and chat or relax food was overpriced and not good",2,2016,08,23
249,Another excellent stay here,"Our family are just back from a 3 night stay here. Room only rate €350 for 3 nights. Spotlessly clean hotel with friendly staff. Quiet warm at night but we did have a fan in the room thankfully. 5mins walk from Liffey valley shopping centre with lots of shops, restaurants & a cinema. Tks to everyone.",4,2016,08,23
249,Consistently Excellent,"We have stayed here numerous times over the years, we have always enjoyed our stay. The rooms are spacious and quiet. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The hotel is close to Liffey valley and Dublin city. 

If you're staying in Dublin then you can't go wrong staying here. 

",5,2016,08,22
249,Very clean and comfortable hotel,"We stayed here for a two night break to take kids on a tour of Dublin City. The check in staff are very helpful and friendly and nothing was a problem. The rooms, we were on the second floor, are very clean, modern, and the beds are really comfortable. We also had a fan as it was very humid. Breakfasts were great but very busy. I'd definitely stay here again, secure parking 6euro per day and a super leisure centre on site. Very reasonably priced.",5,2016,08,22
249,Great Value Hotel,"Stayed here recently for one night as our youngest had an appt in Crumlin Childrens Hospital. We stayed on a Sunday night. Our room was spacious and clean. The decor in the bathroom was tired however it was very clean and the shower head over the bath was powerful. We had dinner in Gusto's and i have to say i was very impressed by the food and i would highly recommend to anybody.

Our kids went to the kids club and thoroughly enjoyed it and were completely entertained for the two hours. Breakfast on monday was a bit manic but we did arrive down at the busiest time so i cant really have any complaints.

All in all a good hotel and as we travel to Dublin regularly for hospital visits we could well use it as our base

",4,2016,08,22
249,Very Noisy,"We booked here a week in advance and were informed that we would have to bring our own travel cot. Obviously extremely busy and we had no issue with this. 

When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist and when we went to our room we were impressed by the size of it. It had a wheelchair accessible toilet which you don't see in every hotel as they try to maximise their use of space. 

We ate in the Kudos, which served Asian food. The waitress was very friendly and the food was delicious and we were not waiting too long even though it was extremely busy. 

As we had an infant with is we went to our room around 8 to get some rest. However the amount of noise from then until around 23:30 was way too much. Every door seemed to bang closed and there was a lot of activity on our floor. As it seemed to be a family floor there were lots of kids running from room to room and along the corridors. They eventually woke our baby up with the noise being made from banging doors. I thought it was something that took from our stay. 

At breakfast in the morning there was a long queue for to get into the room. We were there around 8 but had to wait 20 mins to be seated. Everything in the breakfast area is self service. I didn't  really like the sausages, rashers or pudding as they were way too salty. The sausages were also hard and had probably dried out too much. 

Overall the noise took from our stay even though I must say it was very busy. Having said that we have stayed in many hotels that were very busy but didn't have same levels of disruption for us.",3,2016,08,22
249,Very Professional and Comfortable,The only complaint I have was the chairs in the bar were incredibly noisy when moved! Get some felt guys! Oh and there was no Guinness all weekend for some reason. Check in queues were pretty long too.,4,2016,08,22
249,"Great stay, as usual!","Arrived before midday to check in with my sister & two daughters. Martina our wonderful receptionist upgraded our accommodation to an apartment! We were delighted as  she offered to arrange all sleeping arrangements with a smile & no bother. Couldn't fault the Clarion, as usual. Although it's a busy hotel, staff are efficient & very friendly. Hope to be back again soon. Thanks Martina for being so kind 😃",5,2016,08,21
249,A stayover with daughter and mother.,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Clarion Liffey Valley. An upgrade saw us stay in an appartment which was very convenient when staying with my daughter and mother. It was spotless and my 6 year old was fascinated by the washer/dryer that had a room to itself. We had dinner at Gusto which was excellent and even though restaurant was busy, service was first class. Even though we were early to breakfast it was still very busy, this was handled excellently by staff and we were sent to the overflow room. It was very nice and probably quieter than the main room. My daughter served herself scrambled eggs and hashbrowns and also loved getting juice for us. The only thing that niggled for the whole stay was that the toaster was in the corner of the breakfast service and a bottleneck would occur as people tried to get bread. It should be moved separately like the tea/coffee is. My daughter really loved her kids club experince at Masterchef and enjoyed making pizza and cookies. I cannot fault the staff and i have already booked a return visit where i hope my daughter can avail of more of the kids club activities.",5,2016,08,21
249,Good hotel for a quick stop,"We stayed here in a family room three adults and one child the room was fine though warm a fan was provided which we did use.The staff that we dealt with where friendly and professional.We are in Gusto in the hotel food was fine and not too badly priced for a hotel,overall the hotel was fine for what we needed it for don't know if I would like to stay for much longer with four people in this room but it was grand for our stay.",4,2016,08,20
249,Nice but very busy hotel. ,We have stayed in the hotel numerous times over the last few years and have always enjoyed our stay. The hotel is always busy with families and breakfast is chaotic as there's not enough staff to cope at peak times. We ate our evening meal in the restaurant to avail of a midweek meal deal advertised on the hotel tv service but when we got to the restaurant the deal had been withdrawn some time ago apparently. Rooms are always clean and well presented. ,4,2016,08,20
249,Family trip,"Stayed for 2nights with our 3 kids and nanny too. Got a 2bed apartment and wow is all I can say. It was fab, really modern, really clean and really spacious. You could live there and be comfortable. Had dinner 1 night in the restaurant and the food was delicious and staff could not do enough for us. Kids club was brill a magic show and disco the kids were well entertained. 
Only downside is there was no music or entertainment for the adults in the bar either night we stayed. ",5,2016,08,19
249,Very good value,Stayed here twice during the summer of 2016. It is good value for the price charged. Good variety of food available in the bar and restaurant and the quality is very good. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.,4,2016,08,18
249,Brilliant complex for families!,"When we arrived we were greeted by friendly helpful staff. We stayed in a family room as a group of 3 adults and a child for 2 nights. The room was clean and modern with enough space for everyone and our luggage with good free wifi. There was a well stocked tea tray, an iron, a TV, a hair dryer and toiletries. The beds were so comfortable and I had a brilliant nights sleep on both nights. We were at reception several times for advice and every time the staff were more than helpful.

The complex includes a health club and the swimming pool is free for hotel users and the provide towels and sell other swimming bits and bobs. It is worth noting that it is compulsory to wear a swimming hat which can bought for 3 Euro. The staff in the health centre weren't as friendly but adequate.

There is a shopping complex and plenty of places to eat just across the road and it is situated close to Dublin City centre.All in all fab place for little money.",5,2016,08,17
249,Fabulous hotel for kids! ,"Just back today from a 2 night stay for my daughters birthday. First of all we had a problem paying at reception after a lengthy wait they were so slow to check us in. Thankfully that was the only problem we had.. The hotel was extremely warm but our room had already a fan which was a life saver for us ! Swimming pool was great and the kids where always in it .. Kids area was hard to find but once we found it it was easy enough to get to , plenty of vending machines if needed a drink and in this weather it was a must.. Also we where surprised at how much storage we had in our room and it also had a fridge which was a bonus.. We ate at the shopping centre which was a 2min drive or a 10 min walk we found that the restaurant in the hotel was overly expensive. Deffo would love to come back to this hotel!!",5,2016,08,16
249,Modest Accommodation,"We chose this hotel for it's location, relatively close to the Dublin Airport. Nothing spectacular, but an average hotel, good enough for a night's sleep before heading to the airport.  Decent price and relatively comfy room.",3,2016,08,14
249,Is it not illigal to have kids in a bar after 10pm!!!,Currently writing this review at 11pm on a Sat night in one of your hotel rooms!! Why? Because of the ridiculous amount of kids literally running riot in the bar! Between the adults and kids doing the Congo past us from bar to reception and another group dancing in a circle it is not an atmosphere to enjoy a drink in. The noise level is ridiculous I'm not a kill joy but obviously you are milking these parents for as much money as possible 'it seems like a case of sure if the parents are happy drinking what about the kids if they run around a bit! Well any chance you might consider the adults like me with a child over 18 who are willing to spend more at bar instead of being in their room? I did ask a barman is it 10pm you ask kids to leave his answer was Ya: Well last time I stayed here approx 8 years ago we were asked by staff to leave bar area with our then 11 year old so we duly did sit near reception to enjoy our drinks and rightly so because who wants kids pumped up on coca cola and crisps mashed into the carpet while paying for drinks! Date of stay Aug 13th and if you ask security about telling kids on 1st floor near play area to shut up because of noise distruption then there is your answer...won't be back and won't recommend to anybody!,1,2016,08,13
249,Great Staff,"Thank you to Michalina & Ashleigh for looking after us when there was a mix up with our booking..( a third party booking ) The Hotel was not at fault, but to their credit gave me the room i thought i had booked. I am very grateful ladies...you might not have noticed it but i was ready to drive home.!! When we eventually got our family room the girls decided that they wanted a pizza in the room from Gusto Restaurant . they were not disappointed 
..top marks from them and they are fussy !! Will post a comment tomorrow about breakfast but am expecting good things in the morning.  The girls were impressed with the Games room also.. Again thank you Michalina & Ashleigh for taking matters into your own hands and making our first visit to The Clarion a very happy one. We will be back.",5,2016,08,12
249,A mixed bag - 4*?,"Positives - location for Tayto and Zoo (20-30min drives) & a shopping cebtre 10mins away. Friendly staff (mostly) including house keeping etc. Pool. 

Negatives - too warm. 6euro a day parking, food quality, communication, room size/standard.

The detail- 
We arrived to a warm welcome - roasting in fact - as the entire hotel is incredibly hot. Well almost everywhere, apart from the male shower room in the pool/spa area which was freezing.

There had been a lot of communication regarding adding on meals pre-arrival but - in short - information was conflicting & very inflexible. For instance, we had been told of a deal of 50eur for a family meal package but this had gone up in price to 60eur...I had assumed the 50e was a 'unique deal'. Not to worry we thought...we can just book the deal when entering the restaurant, as instructed. Unfortunately, the lady at the Gusto restaurant had no knowledge of any Gusto meal package but was able to find us a table. I had also read of a pasta/pizza and glass of wine deal - but this was not offered. Not to worry...

We had our dinner which was disappointing for the price paid. The pizza carne was greasy, the kids chicken dinner was very dry and the veg overcooked (possibly reheated) and a strange tasting cream lacking carbonara pasta. There was no gusto to the food and we were sorry we had eaten there and not at the shopping centre. No one checked on us throughout the meal. Service was hap hazard but ok. With two tired children we paid up and went to the room. Why start serving at 6pm? Surely 5pm would be more family orientated to allow kids to avail of the pool and kids club in good time. This resulted in our son having 15 mins to sample the pool (within generous times to be fair 9am to 7pm). Unfortunately my wife was directed outside with my son and not through the Kudos bar area. 

The family room was average for the price paid and in a 4* hotel. Have seen better in 3* hotels. It was compact. Storage was lacking for a family staying for 3 nights, although having a fridge was great. The carpet had seen better days (stains and threading). The bathroom was decent but had a shower curtain (a pet hate). On the plus side there was plenty of warm water - to help keep the room in its warm state (no extractor fan). The room was so warm that I took to the spare single by the window and left my wife the double. Thankfully we had prearranged a large fan otherwise sleep eould have been even more uncomfortable. No biscuits on the hospitality tray or a couple of bottles of water...come on?

Breakfast on the first day. I had been told breakfast would have been added on by email...it hadn't been arranged. We got breakfast but we're bemused by the tea and coffee flasks. The food was OK and consisted of the usual fry, cereals and cold selection. Who doesn't love a Danish pastry? Unfortunately, the pastries seemed liked the previous days offerings. Thankfully on the next two mornings it improved...although we were never offered tea or coffee when seated while other tables were. Be prepared for a coffee hint to your tea when it comes. The staff at breakfast were generally very professional & pleasant. I felt sorry for them due to the large number of guests - perhaps another couple of people would improve service for everyone. 

Our son enjoyed the entertainment at tge kids club (7-9pm). Unfortunately we had to hunt for the info our selves as we were not told about it at checkin. We were not told about having to buy a 5e wristband. This resulted in being turned away by the lady at the kids club room and having a long wait at reception behind many other arriving guests to get one (15mins). 

Conveniently a tour bus picks up around 945am at the hotel and a public bus stops nearby. My wife was told it stopped at the shopping centre...25 a stops at the side of the busy dual carriageway. Again the wrong information!

The small Playpark is decent, but the room with air hockey needs revamped - the air hockey table needs replaced and the pool table was ripped with no cues in the room. The smaller kids area near this room was nice.

All in all, our sons enjoyed the stay but at the price I am not sure it was good value. The gbp to eur rate didn't help when considering value for money.

249,Enjoyable evening,"I recently dined in the clarion & have to say there was very little i could fault. We ate in the Asian restaurant ""kudos"" ( i think it was called) & the food was brilliant. The staff were on top of everything & nothing was too much to ask for.Our waitress Coco was very attentative and constantly made sure we were looked after. After dining we then went into the bar area & were served by a lovely young lad called jack who looked after us despite looking after a queue of people at the bar aswell! The one bad thing I have to say however is the lack of air conditioning in the bar, while there were fans placed around the floor it was still very warm,other than this it was a very enjoyable evening and we will definitely be back soon",4,2016,08,11
249,Excellent Overnight stay,"We stayed in this hotel after our flight from Spain, we got in very late, but the staff were very helpful and good customer service. We did ask for a quite room and we got it, the bed was one of the most comfortable bed I have sleep in. Bathroom had a bath (was delighted on that one) had shower cap and all gels in place, good night sleep. Breakfast was very busy but very enjoyable and yes we would stay there again and would tell everyone to say there.
Well done to all the staff and a big thank you to all.
Ger & Sean",4,2016,08,11
249,Handy place to stop over on your travels,"We stayed at The Clarion at the beginning and end of our tour of Southern Ireland. It is very handy as it is not far from the ferry terminal. The rooms are big, clean and spacious but the hotel itself is very busy with people rushing around and queuing for the dining room. Breakfast was very pleasant but our set evening meal was little disappointing. Not a lot of choice just chicken or fish on both nights and they kept running out of veg. We had a very long wait for an average meal. The portions were very small too and although we don't eat a lot we were still hungry. However the hotel served its purpose and seems to be run efficiently.",3,2016,08,11
249,Disappointing,"My  wife and I have just returned from 3 expensive nights in this supposed 4 star hotel
Firstly booked I had booked a superior room but was advised that were  allocated an apartment which was several minutes from the main hotel it was near a noisy main road it was cold and the bed was unmade by housekeeping  during our stay 
At breakfast the porridge was congealed and the only fruit available was fruit salad
There is no bar and the  only place  get a drink was a dark and dingy room This hotel not cater for mature couples",2,2016,08,10
249,Great hotel for kids,"My kids have attended swimming lessons at the clarion hotel for the past 2 years. My son went from being nervous in the water to lane swimming within in few months. 
We also live local and have had meals in the restaurant. The food is excellent and the staff are very friendly. The offers that they have are fantastic. During the summer months my kids love to go to the Gusto Master chef where they make Pizza and Cookies. ",5,2016,08,10
249,Superb staff,"Some of the friendliest and most helpful hotel staff I have encountered...especially Patrick by kudos Restaraunt. 

Family rooms are very good and hotel is well located for access to Dublin zoo and city centre.  

Near restaraunts and shopping. 

",4,2016,08,09
249,Family Break,"Stayed in this hotel on recommendation from friends who had already mentioned how warm the rooms can get but I have to say we still weren't prepared for how warm & uncomfortable they were.  Stayed 3 nights and got very little sleep each night.  Breakfast was included and it was OK, we also had 2 dinners included and both nights dined in the Italian Restaurant.  Food was average each night and we were disappointed to be given a different menu when the meal was included.  Location is good for Zoo and town etc.  The staff are friendly and helpful but I wouldn't stay again.",3,2016,08,09
249,Disappointing dining,I have previously stayed in this hotel and the rooms were lovely. I couldnt fault the rooms. I had breakfast that time which was average enough. I was back to eat in the Italian restaurant again today which was very disappointing and overpriced considering what you get. There was 5 of us. We all agreed the food was tasteless. What bothered me more was the crockery wasnt clean as had been the case on my previous visit. I find that very offputting. Its a lovely hotel but i advise giving gusta's a miss!!,3,2016,08,07
249,Family friendly and good value hotel near Liffey Valley,This hotel has everything a family could need when visiting Dublin. 2 on site restaurants and a swimming pool mean that you can entertain the family without leaving the hotel iif the weather isn't on your side. The Liffey Valley shopping centre is across the road and there is a regular hotel shuttle. Recommend checking this for your next trip to Dublin. My only issue was the lack of air con and the room was therefore too hot at night.,4,2016,08,07
249,Family Break,"We have just recently stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley, availing of their Dublin Zoo 2 night stay deal. Rooms were really clean and spacious but our bed was unacceptably noisy - we got very little sleep and our kids were woken every time one of us moved a muscle. The heat in the rooms was also sweltering and unfortunately this made for an uncomfortable 2 nights.  Reception staff were absolutely lovely - really warm, friendly and efficient and great with the kids. We went to Gusto for dinner one night and were shocked at the final bill for OK quality food. Breakfast was a decent selection however our seats (by the windows) had very cold air con directly above which made our food and coffee ice cold in no time. The hotel was good value for the deal and the children loved the zoo - location was great for handiness and staff were fantastic but I think a couple of small improvements could be made.",3,2016,08,07
249,Could have been an outstanding stay if it had air condition!,"Stayed in Clarion for 6 nights.  My room and service was wonderful!  It was very clean and had almost a great night of sleep.  Because I feel like I'm a hot nature kind of person, I do require a room to be cooler to enjoy my sleep.  I don't think the hotel has air condition in their rooms.  I was brought an extra fan to keep the room cooler.  The bus stop is a good 15 minute walk.  I was fine doing this everyday to get to the city.  Did use a taxi on 2 occasions.  The taxi is quite expensive to get to the city compared to the bus fare.  If you want a peaceful hotel away from the all the action at the end of the day, then this is the hotel for you.  The only reason I filled in 4 circles was because it lacked air condition.",4,2016,08,06
249,Nice hotel ,"Staying in the clarion at the minute. Nice hotel , very big. Reception staff lovely. Ate in kudos one night.. Overpriced and just ok...It's an Asian restaurant. 2nd night ate in gustos restaurant which is also located in the hotel. Pizzas to die for.. Only downsides to this hotel is that you have to pay for parking.. Our room is miles away from reception and also would've been nice to have an Irish bar/restaurant in it. Seeing we are in Ireland! All in all I wouldn't rush back but ok for short stay. ",3,2016,08,03
249,Great value fab location,Stayed in January with my sister and niece in a deluxe family room.Really spacious room.Bathroom great complimentary toiletries. Great location near Liffey Valley shopping centre and close to bus stops into city.Breakfast while very busy was tasty varied and fresh.Had great food in bar and restaurant.We will return,5,2016,08,02
249,Good value for money except for parking.,"We booked two adjoining rooms and were happy with the quality of the accommodation and the service. We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel as it was quite expensive but, we got a good deal on the rooms. The bar is a bit staid and could benefit from some live entertainment but the Kid's Club got a high five from our young ones.  It is a really family friendly hotel and well located for Dublin Zoo, the National Aquatic Centre, etc. My only real gripe was having to pay €6 per night for parking.",5,2016,08,02
249,Disappointing stay,"We stayed in the Clarion Hotel in Liffey Valley in July for 1 night , we booked a family room with breakfast. The room was standard enough but it was fine for the 1 night. The room was very warn with no air conditioning except a plug in fan . When we got up the next morning we went down for breakfast it was approx 9.40am so we knew it was peak time so we didn't mind joining the queue for the restaurant. We queued for approx 20mins reached the top of the queue and the lady took our room number and name, she checked her listing and then proceeded to ask us if it would be OK if we took our breakfast in the bar area and not the restaurant, we obliged, but I am very sorry that we did...... when we got into the bar area all the tables were dirty and unset and there was only 1 staff member there to look after the number of us that were directed to the bar area, we got a table and the staff member set the table for us, we then proceed to get our breakfast (self service which I didn't mind) but the food was all cold, the tea was in a one of those service flasks that you would use in a garage and it was also cold I would say that it was there since early morning. We were very disappointed with the hotel and the service and I had planned on complaining when we checked out an hour later but we were never asked ""how was your stay and if everything was ok"" because we had already paid for the night in advance all the lady at reception did was check us out. I really don't think that we will be staying there again we have stayed in other hotels with a lower star rating and they are miles ahead of this hotel when it cones to service. I will not be recommending this hotel to family and friends.",1,2016,08,01
249,Frustrating!!,"We arrived here on Thursday at 5pm. No queue at check-in which we were happy with until we spoke to the receptionist! We had booked 3 rooms, paid for one and had the 2 others to be paid on arrival. We were told that nonpayment had been made and we had 3 rooms to pay for. After finding the receipt for payment we were still told that we had not paid!! This went on for a further 20 minutes until the receptionist, Sheila I think her name was, finally informed us that one room had been paid for!! We were then given a room, two double rooms with extra beds made up. We complained to said receptionist that it was only two adults but she said we had two children with us! No we didn't we explained and she gave us a further room. This room also had a double bed with two single beds made up!!! Again we went to reception and said we didn't have children with us!!! We got upgraded to a suite, huge balcony but very basic room. We had a very long corridor to walk before we got to the lift. It got quite busy with guests and housekeeping trolleys in the way. We asked the same receptionist to book a taxi for us that night as its a bit out of town and we asked for 6 people. After waiting nearly 45 minutes a taxi for 4 people turned up!! They said that was what was ordered! Another 30 minutes later we got our taxi to town. Hurray. 
Disappointed all restaurants around the area stop serving around 9-10 pm but Patrick from Kudos was brilliant. When we got home after sightseeing one day and everything was closed he gave us a number for a local delivery service and went out his way to help us. Excellent customer service. Cocktails here were also fab! 
Breakfast had good selection. Rooms too hot and we stayed 4 nights and our bedding wasn't changed. We paid 800 + euro for 4 nights b&b so expected better than we had. ",3,2016,08,01
249,More good than bad,"Room was very nice. Well decorated. Massive bed that could've slept four! Had a great sleep. I would describe the hotel as well decorated and nicely designed throughout.

We went as an overnight stay as part of a coach tour and this is, I expect, where the hotel let itself down. Three coaches turned up at once. Evening meal tasted good but it was service with a sneer and was very slow. 45 minutes to get the starter and a further 30 to get the main. Not all plates were cleared between courses and food was slapped in front of us.

Breakfast was a let down. It was  buffet style and the food that was meant to be hot was cold. 

The food meant this was a four rating. Better food and service and it would be a five.",4,2016,08,01
249,weekend family break,"We stayed here as part of a package from Stena line   We travelled from Glasgow Scotland to Belfast and we drove down for a first family visit to Dublin, Hotel lovely, the staff were very welcoming.  There were extra charges were incurred for 6 euro per day for parking and 3 euro for a swimming cap which was compulsory to use the pool.  We had a family room, a double bed and sofa bed, tea coffee making facilities, iron/board, money safe big enough for a laptop, hairdryer included also shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, were complimentary.  We also had free WIFI, this was good.  I asked for a wee fridge, this was handy as the rooms were very hot, although we had a fan it was too noisy to use during the night, so I opened the window as we were on the 5th floor, this kept the room cool, but felt it was noisy in the morning with coaches arriving. Our Bed was made daily and towels changed daily if required. We never used the restaurants, the leisure centre or the pool. 
 We went into the bar at the end of our day,all the staff very friendly, the prices were expensive but so is the rest of Dublin.. the hotel is less than 25 euro taxi ride from city centre.  There is a large shopping centre a short 5 minute walk away.  We enjoyed our stay and would go back there.",4,2016,08,01
249,Sean Mac,"We stayed in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley for one night 31st July with our teenage daughter and on arrival we were upgraded to an apartment which had everything from a dishwasher to a washing machine and it was immaculate and massive ! Unfortunately as it was just an overnight, the only appliance used was the kettle. The hotel was very busy and the queue for breakfast reached the front door but the lad on the door was on top of his game and was seating people along with serving tea or coffee pots at the same time ! Definitely worth watching him in action !! On check out Jane was really really nice and cheerful ! ( she has an uncle in a very internationally famous Dublin band but I won't tell which one ). We had a lovely stay and are looking forward to a return visit !! ",4,2016,08,01
249,Summer Break,Reception staff excellent especially Jane. Food in Gustos very good. Rooms very clean. Swimming pool good. Car parking facilities excellent.  Really recommend. Kids club available. Breakfast can be very busy especially after 9. Great variety of food in morning.,5,2016,07,31
249,family stop,handy to get to from the motorway. rooms are not massive for a family. pool is good. Dinner was lovely. Big queue @ breakfast but well managed.Downside...Had to pay to park my car there. I spend money on accom drinks dinner and i have to pay to park my car. Should be free for residents,4,2016,07,31
249,So much has changed since last time stayed here,"We stayed here for 5 days,the bed was not changed the whole time were here or the floor wasnt hoovered ,it was 6 every evening by time cleaners got to our room,so we had to wait till they went to get showered for dinner,we ate in both restaurants in hotel,very pricey for what u get and the waiter in kudos restaurant was so rude as he thought I didn't pay bill and I had already paid the manager,he kept pointing at me in front of others then didn't even apologise,there was just no atmosphere this time round and we thought standards fell to an all time low since our last visit,we also were not informed it would be 6euro a day to park in the hotel car park",2,2016,07,31
249,Good fun ,"Ok so myself and my husband had a week off work and we were day tripping around with the kids. We weren't planning on staying anywhere overnight but we got a great deal on an executive suite, the only reason we took it was the separate sitting room area so we cud put the kids to bed and relax but unfortunately the door separating the rooms is ""no longer in use"" according to the staff. 
But despite that the hotel is really nice, the staff are great and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel is so family friendly and I would stay again I was just disappointed about the door.",3,2016,07,28
249,Good base for family break,"Stayed in family room with 2 children for two nights. Wanted to stay reasonably close to Dublin, but without the hassle of driving into the city. 

Its in a good location and the family room was a decent size and nicely presented. Staff helpful, although the check-in seemed to take far longer than necessary (must have taken over 20 minutes to check in 3 rooms in front of me in the queue).  Staff very helpful though and the facilities in the hotel are good.  The fact the hotel had a pool was one of the main reasons we chose it and its definitely worth a visit.

There is a smallish childrens playground in the grounds of the hotel, which won't keep them occupied for very long, but is still a nice touch for those visiting with small children. It was nice to have somewhere to let them run around for half an hour and definitely appreciated. 

Its in a great location for venturing into Dublin or to visit some of the attractions nearby. With children we went to Tayto Park, and Fort Lucan adventure playground, both of which were only a fairly short drive away.

On the whole its a good spot for a short family break.",4,2016,07,28
249,Fantastic family friendly hotel,"We stayed here this month with our 2 kids for the first time. The hotel was recommended by family who had stayed before. From our arrival to departure everything was thoroughly enjoyable. The food in Gusto was delicious and the portion sizes perfect  😀  The staff in the restaurant were obviously used to dealing with families and were as attentive to the kids as the adults!  The breakfast was well presented and had so much variety. 
The room was ample for what we required and well stocked with all the necessary requirements ie iron and board. .safe etc. The tea tray was well stocked and had mugs which was a small delight for 2 that love their tea 😁
The children (4 & 8) really enjoyed the Kids Club evening entertainers and it gave mum and dad 2 peaceful hours to relax! 
The highlight for or kids was the pool and they would happily have spent all their time in it. The wee play area outside was a great addition during the warm weather. 
The hotel staff were all very pleasant and accommodating at all times. 
There was only one negative from our stay which was the lack of air conditioning in the rooms. It was quite warm weather during our break and although a fan was provided it did little really to cool the room! I believe that air conditioning would be a huge bonus in the future. 
Well done on providing such a great location and service for families and we would certainly return again!

249,Terrible customer support ,"We stated at the clarion liffey valley for one night , to be close to the airport the next morning.  When we got there the people on reception were very nice . Went to the room which was a large double bed and a couch bed (for a family of 4). We didn't eat in the hotel . We did have a drink in the  bar , which was fine,  a bit rough around the edges but fine. 

We went up to the room for baths / showers and noticed that there was only towels for one person. Rummaged through the wardrobe and found another one.  As there were 4 of us we rang down to reception and asked for more towels. Waited over half an hour and they didn't show up so the 4 of us made do with the 2 towels.  

Went to bed, the 2 kids were asleep and myself am husband were falling asleep when someone walked into our room !! We rang reception and we're told it was probably housekeeping even though no towels were left behind and it was 11:30 at night !! 

The next morning when we checked out nothing was said to us and we didn't say anything either because we didn't want to start our holiday off bad. I sent off an email complaining about how we were treated.  And the best they could come up with was to come back and try the hotel again but we have to pay for it !! 

We paid €174 and didn't even get any breakfast, we didn't have enough towels, reception didn't do the simple request we made and someone  (we still don't know who ) walked into our room while we were asleep.  ",1,2016,07,27
249,Family 2 Night Stay,"This is very modern hotel in immaculate condition. The rooms are very nice as the bathrooms - very standard in layout but nicely finished. 

There is a secure and spacious underground car park, a very reasonable price too.

The bar gets busy (live music omn Saturdays) but if you get served by either Dan or Jack you'll be fine! Two great young fellas behind the bar.

The food was also good with plenty of fresh hot breakfast and a great Italian menu at night. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, thank you Nicole.

Be aware the breakfast is busy some mornings and a queue can form to be seated. But the young staff were turning the dirty tables around quickly and the queue moves along at a fair pace.

The leisure facilities are top notch. The kids will love the pool. Ours did.. we had to drag them away!

Liffey Valley shopping centre is a 5-10 mins walk.

Nothing bad to say really... We will use this hotel again.",4,2016,07,27
249,Avoid the restaurant and don't expect too much from the reception staff,"Clarion

The first impression of the hotel is made at reception and the hotel fails on this one. The desk was staffed by teenagers who did not really know what they were doing and check-in took way too long.  The impression I got was from dealing with Asleigh was that it was her first day. I had phoned her the previous day and it took an age to get the matter sorted.It was also clear hat there is no cooperation or coordination between restaurant and reception.It has always been like this. 
I was about to go into the restaurant which was a bad idea. I was greeted by cheeky teenagers who appeared to be working there. The staff do not seem to realise that the way they speak on the streets and with their friends is not the way they should speak with customer, but that is a failing of management. I dined instead in the bar where the staff were great. I also encountered a waiter called Stephen who was very professional and helpful. It was almost like a different hotel.

Breakfast was a miserable experience. The staff all had dour expressions, more miserable than the grey morning outside. I had to fight to hold onto my crockery before it was snapped away by a staff eager to get people out the door. By contrast the cleaning staff all seemed to be in a good mood. 
I have stayed here on business before and it has the reputation hat the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  It is different to other Clarions around the country. Don’t expect too much from this one.
The hotel does have some positive aspects such as being child friendly and having a leisure centre.",2,2016,07,27
249,Average hotel,"Stayed Friday to Monday. Hotel was nice and clean but very noisy with kids running up and down the corridors until the early hours. Bed wasn't comfy at all in fact was on a slope! Breakfast was ok but didn't eat anything else. Handy mini bus shuttle for airport was good. Room was acceptable, just. ",3,2016,07,26
249,Break away,I had a wonderful time away with my two kids here. We ate in the Asian food restaurant which was delicious. Kids were allowed be kids here and the restaurant staff were so helpful that I was very grateful. It was a delightful experience which I hope to relive again soon.,4,2016,07,25
249,"excellent staff , service and facilities","i was here for business related activities, staff could not have been more helpful, and friendly.facilities are very good , especially the leisure centre. food in the bar and the restaurant was of a good standard. bedrooms were spacious, very comfortable and clean.the shuttl bus to the airport is a great service , and i have used it on a number of occasions to and from the hotel.the coffee shop in the hotel lobby serves the best coffee , and the baristas are charming and very professional.whilst this is not a luxury hotel, i think that it offers great facilities and services for tourists , and business people alike. it makes a great base to see Dublin , and the countryside , and beaches of Wicklow, and Co Dublin.",4,2016,07,25
249,Think twice ,"We decided to travel the day before and stay near the airport to make our departure relaxing and unhurried. Sadly The breakfast experience put paid to that idea and was not to be repeated. The main problem was the poor quality of the food. Cereals were all child focussed. Porridge was just awful. It had run out, with what was left burnt and dried onto a le creuset  pot. When the newly made porridge arrived it was added to the previous leftovers. It was so sticky, thick and tasteless that it couldn't be eaten. While the experience couldn't be turned round the manager dealt with my feedback extremely sympathetically and genuinely wanted to rectify the situation. He was more than reasonable in compensating us including refunding the breakfast cost as it was inedible. My suggestions include more streamlined queuing with the front of house person being aware of the requirements for table size for the front of the queue, a bain marie for the porridge with a lesson for the chef in how to make proper porridge (the crowne plaza and Aisling hotels will assist), a two tier pricing as many dublin hotels have for a mini or full breakfast as €12 for cereal and tea is a little excessive. I am truly grateful to the manager for his professionalism. The hotel is obviously a very good place for families with children But not for couples in the high summer season.
We had breakfast 'again' when we got to the airport which i have to say was 200% better if you can believe that.",3,2016,07,25
249,Good but very busy,"Cleaning of the lobby area was poor , dirt around the grooves on the tables , young manager at breakfast was too busy trying to order staff to get cups which he could of did himself instead of complaining about his staff , in the end I had to get them myself , young blonde on reception was abrupt and rude when I just tried to hand over my room cards on leaving . Restaurant should have more staff at night to seat customers and let people pay bills instead of having one guy trying to do both badly",4,2016,07,25
249,""" A nice modern hotel in the heart of Liffey Valley""","Only stayed here one night. And the experience was very good. A very clean and tidy hotel, with pleasant, helpful staff, food very good. Our room was very airey with a great view over the front of the hotel overlooking the car park. Make sure if you do book in here that you get a room at the front as the rooms at the back of the hotel are looking out over the motorway. Which for people who are light sleepers it could come over a (tad) little noisy. Some rooms have a veranda. Large dining area and many amenities for you to enjoy while you spend time at The Clarion Hotel.",4,2016,07,25
249,Good Hotel for Dublin Getaway,"We stayed a Clarion Liffey Valley July 2016 and the personnel was very nice.  Had quick check-in and stayed in the suites area.  Our room was nice and all the amenities were there.  Bed was quite comfortable.  Bathroom clean.  We had breakfast included in our reservation and found it to be very good. As far as I'm concerned it was a little hard to find, but then again our gps wasn't updated. To resumed mid range hotel that did what it was suppose to do.  We had a Great Stay!",4,2016,07,25
249,Very helpful and friendly staff,"Cannot commend the staff enough in this hotel. After a busy day with a young child manager in duty in Gusto was only to willing to help us by carrying the remainder of our meals down to our room for us when out son fell asleep in the middle of the restaurant. Clean, comfortable and good sized rooms accompanied by helpful and friendly staff. ",5,2016,07,24
249,Big spacious hotel,"Visited this hotel several times already for business. Hotel is huge, the outside looks like a hospital. Wifi is excellent in most rooms. Enough choice for breakfast, but it doesn't change. Bar is at the Eastern restaurant, could be better. Eastern restaurant is fine, Italian also ok but expensive. If You prefer Italian go to the mall to Prezzo.",4,2016,07,24
249,"Excellent hotel, with excellent facilities & food! Great location also","We booked a family room which was excellent, very spacious, clean and comfortable.  We had booked a meal in the hotel restaurant (Gusto's) and the food was exceptional, both for the adults and my two kids.  Good variety to choose from especially for the kids.  The leisure centre was very nice with a lovely pool.  Very good size baby / kiddies pool and main pool, excellent changing facilities etc.  Free Wifi also which was great.",5,2016,07,22
249,A very welcoming  Hotel.,"We recently stayed at the clarion Hotel and we had a very enjoyable stay,from the reception staff and from the staff in the restaurant  and throughout all very helpful and friendly,very accommodating for children with the kids club and pool area,food was delicious and rooms very comfortable would really recommend  this hotel if planning on a trip to tayto park or Zoo,would definitely come back here and will be recommending  the Clarion Hotel to friends and family.",5,2016,07,21
249,Super helpful barman,I stayed at this hotel for one night with two young children.  On leaving I discovered my car battery was flat.  I struggled to find someone to help me until I spoke to Paddy the barman.  He was extremely helpful and accommodating and helped me to get my car started again.  He was also very considerate of the fact that I was travelling alone with two young children.  I would also like to add that he provided a high standard of service when we had a meal in the bar the previous evening.  The bar was very busy and it was difficult to get service while keeping an eye on my children.  Paddy was great and brought over menus and drinks as he could see I needed some extra help.,3,2016,07,21
249,"No AC, unorganised mess","No air conditioning causing lack of sleep, useless fans in the room only. Even on a colder day the halls and rooms are unbearable we would have left the hotel to stay somewhere else if it had been possible for us.
They don't change the sheets in the room for your whole stay. They don't give enough towels only 1 or 2 for a family. Takes them a long time to bring extra towels when requested.
Rubbish left it hallways. 
Car park tickets never work causing hassle everytime you want to leave. 
It is a family hotel so children are everywhere.
Breakfast was not good, mainly fried food options, plus bad coffee and warm juice, no water at breakfast.
Restaurant is very expensive for the type of food.
I wouldn't recommend, the heat is too much. 
This is NOT 4 star.
AVOID",1,2016,07,21
249,Very good,"Very good hotel but could have done with AC in the bedrooms and not a portable fan.
Hotel staff was fab and Gusto restaurant was very good. 
Didn't use the pool as you had to wear a swimming cap!!
Would use again if AC was in place, very hot at night and hard to sleep.",4,2016,07,19
249,"Avoid the restaurant, otherwise ok for a flying visit","Stayed for one night with two children. Staff friendly, room good - clean and comfortable beds.
Pool area very nice.
Was very disappointed in the restaurant. For a place with huge turnover and lots of families it should have been a lot better. Pizza was good.
Kids pasta was vile. Sent it back once as it was cold, tasted nothing like pasta - came back the second time a bit warmer but still tasted like plastic. I'm guessing it comes pre cooked in packs? Asked for the pasta with butter and parmesan, it came with a bowl of melted butter. Confusing.
Ordered dough balls with a selection of dips. Came with some kind of creamy pink stuff, tasted of nothing. When I asked what it was, I was told it was spicy ricotta. Eh no it wasn't!
Asked for garlic butter instead and was given melted butter.
Kids had icecream, I had a cappuccino which was basically warm milk with a slight coffee flavour.
Very disappointing for the price of the food.
However I would recommend the hotel, just eat out!",3,2016,07,18
249,July family break,"Stayed here mid July for 2 nights in a family room. I chose the clarion for a few reasons:
- the ease of access just off the M50 with Dublin zoo and Tayto Park accessible 
- the pool
- shopping centre nearby

Overall it's pretty overrated
- parking is extra at €6 a night 
- the pool is tiny and packed to capacity during our stay
- avoid the Gusto restaurant- over priced mediocrity- €6 for a class of Merlot (I could have got a bottle in Lidl for it). Even by Clarion standards this is hey day Celtic tiger nonsense 
- finally the room is ok but I've seen far bigger family rooms elsewhere.

In conclusion it will do the job but perhaps you could get better bang for your buck elsewhere.

249,good return visit after a few years,"First time back here with family in tow for about 8 years. Stayed for 2 nights b&b and dinner in a family room. Room size was great, still amazed no aircon, the hotel gets so hot at night, thankfully they provided a fan in the room. Dinner in Gusto's was great value and included in the price we paid. Breakfast was great and even though busy we never found ourselves queing for anything even though it was after 9am. The kids loved the pool, and the games room, free unlimited air hockey is always a winner! We also found the hotel surprisingly noise free for being so busy. My only niggle is the security of the place, there are ways into the bedroom accomodation area that don't involve going through reception and using your room key. and having had a room broken into before in a hotel this concerns me, maybe I'm being paranoid. Wifi was free, and very fast. Overall a great weekend in the hotel and easy access to the M50 so easy to visit lots of places, we will definitely be back!",4,2016,07,18
249,2 night stay,"First visit to Dublin me and my husband was very impressed by the friendly staff , upon arrive we was told we had been upgraded to an apartment . Which was fab everything we could need . Only downside abit of a way out from city centre 
But we are defo going again we loved it :-)",5,2016,07,17
249,Excellent value for the money,"Comfortable room, bed, and accommodations.  Excellent food at the on-site restaurant.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating, inquiring about us, our overall trip, etc.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Recommend it to everyone.  This was our second stay in three weeks and well worth it.  We booked the room through Choice Hotels as a reward night, and the value of what we got versus the number of points (the fewest we've seen) was remarkable.",5,2016,07,17
249,Good clean hotel ,"This is our 3rd stay at Liffey Valley - good clean hotel and pool area. No a/c so rooms do get hot at night! 
Good location to get around Dublin by car - cannot comment on public transport as we have not used.  

Breakfast average, Gustos restaurant excellent for evening meal. 

Breakfast tea is out of a machine - ours tasted of both tea and coffee one morning so we had to get a fresh pot as I am not a coffee drinker!!! 

Nothing like a fresh brewed cup of tea first thing in the morning - unfortunately you will not get that here😕

Maybe that is the way forward for all hotels? - hope not!!!!
",4,2016,07,17
249,Dublin stay,"We stayed at this property for 3 nights and were impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff. Overall hotel was clean and had nice amenities. The biggest drawback was the location-it took us about 50-60 minutes to get to the city center on most trips. The main bus station was about a 15 minute walk and the actual bus ride ranged from 25-45 minutes. However, the buses came frequently and the drivers were helpful with navigating around Dublin. Overall for the price, this hotel was a good option. Takes longer to get places but we preferred this over a hostel or much more expensive hotel in the city center.",4,2016,07,16
249,Short stay. Conference W/E.,"Stayed here for a weekend in early June. Disappointed no A/C in hotel of its size
there was a fan provided.This is a very busy hotel and not in my opinion a place
for a quiet weekend. Very noisy throughout the night and complaints were made by a number of people. Very slow service in the dining room but the food was very good
and the staff very helpful. Excellent conference facilities and everything was perfect in this aspect. Very slow at the reception. Feel there should have been more staff for
the amount of people in the hotel. Would I stay again? no.",3,2016,07,15
249,Excellent customer service,Have stayed in the Clarion at Liffey Valley for the last 2 years. This year I booked fairly last minute and after booking room only realised there were b&b rates available for the same price. Rang the hotel and without any questions they changed the booking at no cost. The staff have always been lovely when we stayed and I was very pleased today at the customer service. Looking forward to our stay next week,5,2016,07,14
249,Doesn't live up to the pictures,"Checked into the hotel after a long day at work, slow check in, staff being trained slowed down the process, upgraded to an apartment after asking for a quiet room, problem is that the room overlooked the childrens play area, not exactly peaceful, reception difficult to contact, rest of hotel very noisy, children running round uncontrolled, overall very disappointed as the pictures and the price leads you to believe that it is a 4 star hotel, not in my opinion, rooms I have to say were very good, if only the rest was the same.",2,2016,07,14
249,"Good rooms, helpful staff, average breakfast","Stayed here while visiting Dublin for surgery at The Beacon hospital. It's only about a 15-20 minute drive away from this hotel so location was ideal. Right across from the Liffey Valley shopping centre too which has a good selection of shops and restaurants.

Family room was great - clean and not too squahed in at all. Air conditioning would have been nice but a large fan is included which helps. Wifi worked well and was surprisingly fast!

Staff upon arrival were pleasant and helpful - checked us in promptly, even waiving the €6 car park charge when we queried it, as it was apparently included in our room rate.

Family room for one night with breakfast for the four of us came to just over €100 which was decent value.

We did not get a chance to use the pool/sauna/gym facilities so I cannot comment on them.

However, breakfast was average. Hot food was undercooked for the most part or left out too long so quite hard.. pastries the same, not as warm/soft as I'd like them to have been. Milk ran out a few times and took a while to be refilled I found. Very busy also so you may be left waiting a few mins for a table at peak times! Newspapers are provided which is nice. The staff member greeting everyone at the entrance to the breakfast area was spot on though, courteous and friendly despite all the madness, so shout out to him!

Would stay here again if needed but wouldn't pay any more than €100 certainly.",3,2016,07,14
249,Good value,Good location 5min walk to shopping centre. Bedroom was average but breakfast was excellent. Really nice with a good selection of food. Construction going on next door on a new car showroom which made lots of noise very early in the morning. Asked for a double bed but it was a twin room and they just pushed two singles together. Amble parking underground. ,3,2016,07,14
249,Functional hotel,"Stayed recently for 1 night.....had a room in the basement or lower ground.....clean and comfortable....but found it functional and no real atmosphere. ....A bit bland.
Would have liked some drinking water to be available in the room as u checked I late but no....would have liked more than 1 towel in the room....and no ac.
Ads I checked in late there was a reduced room service....but I was pleased with the quality of the food ordered and quick time from order to room.
Staff were pleasant if a little stiff and robotic.
No major issues at all which I am happy to say....but felt no draw to return quickly unless on business.....I wouldn't be interested in brining my family to stay as it is just functional.",4,2016,07,14
249,"Spacious Room, Spotless, Two Restaurants Onsite, Parking w/ Fee","This hotel was very busy during our May Day 2016 weekend stay, owing to families with young children on school holiday, at least one wedding party, and a business meeting or two all hosted onsite simultaneously. Regardless, the (sometimes overwhelmed) staff were polite and professional.

Our 2nd floor spacious room was spotlessly clean. Beds were reasonably comfortable, bathroom was also clean. The hallways on our floor were being repainted so there was a faint odor in the room when we first arrived that was easily rectified when the climate control system was running in the room.

Wifi was stable and of a reasonable speed. Our connection was at no charge, but I am not sure if that is because the hotel offers it free to all guests, or if it was because of my Choice Hotels Gold Status.

A ""hen party"" (bridal shower) was happening next door to our room one night. After unsuccessfully trying to sleep due to the loud talking and laughter going on past midnight - I finally called the front desk and lodged a reluctant complaint. I hated to ruin their fun, but we had a full day ahead of us and needed some rest! Hotel security arrived next door a few short minutes later and spoke with the ladies, politely but firmly asking them to consider other guests' needs. To the partiers' credit, they moved down the hall to another room which was far enough from us so that it no longer interrupted our slumber.

We enjoyed having a choice of dining in two different restaurants onsite for evening meals. The continental breakfast was included in our reservation. There was a small upcharge to partake of the full Irish breakfast. We figured out that early morning was much preferred over later if we wished to have a bit of peace and quiet with our tea and toast. Once the families started coming in for breakfast, things got pretty loud and hectic.

Parking in the garage underneath the hotel building is an additional fee, but I liked the security this option provided so I didn't mind paying for it.

Be aware this hotel is not near the typical tourist areas of Dublin, nor is it close by the main airport. We took the local bus line into downtown one morning was about 35-40 minutes including stops along the way. The return ride was a bit longer as we managed to catch the beginning of the evening rush hour when everyone is hurrying home from work. Roundtrip bus fare was about £6 per person which was considerably less than it would have cost for me to drive our rental car into town and try to find parking for it (always a hassle in any major metropolitan city).

I chose this hotel because I had enough Choice Hotels rewards points to stay for free. While the location was not convenient for us as tourists, it was worth the added hassle factor to stay at no cost out of pocket. Overall, I would say this hotel is better suited for business travelers.",4,2016,07,13
249,Nice relaxing stay,"this hotel is in a good location. we just stayed the one night but room was comfy and clean. staff were friendly and nice relaxing pub for a few drinks..including outdoor area. Rooms were large, bed was comfy, shower was nice and no noise disturbance, would recommend staying here.",4,2016,07,13
249,Good Hotel,"This hotel was good, nice and clean and next to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Short 15 / 20 min Drive to Dublin City Centre. 
The pool is great and the bar/restaurant is nice. 
As a play park for children and a small indoor paly area as well. 
What you would expect of a 4 star hotel.",4,2016,07,11
249,"Last night in Ireland, and it is NOT close to the airport","Everything went well once they understood that we had two rooms reserved and paid for. Mark at the front desk was very helpful and handled the reservation problem very well.
This is an older building so the rooms are larger and the baths are people friendly - that is they have room and counters for stuff.
Unfortunately the pool was closed at 7 for the kids so they did not get to swi,.
Breakfast was fine and when they ran out of things( Tea) they quickly responded.
This is a big hotel with very long halls.
It worried us that the fire door that said it would alarm was propped open.",3,2016,07,10
249,Beyonce Concert,"I've stayed at this hotel on many occasions and this time was just as good as any other time. We got a free upgrade which was great and the lady on reception helped book is a taxi to take us to the concert, she was very helpful. I enjoy visiting this hotel but I always forget about the 1 downside which is the lack of air conditioning. The hotel is sooo warm and can be very uncomfortable trying to sleep in the heat. Luckily due to our upgrade we had a balcony so we left the door open for air to get in but otherwise it can be a little unbearable. Overall it is a great hotel but this is the one area I would suggest improvements on.",4,2016,07,10
249,Business Upgrade to Suite - very spacious and comfortable,"Stayed on business for one night, in late June. Was unexpectedly upgraded on arrival to a 2 bedroom suite - which was cavernous and rather overkill for a single traveller - although welcome.

Breakfast in the am was a rather rushed affair - place appeared to be full with tourist coachloads - and the few business travellers rather lost 'in the scrum' - however, managed to root around for some self-service cooked breakfast - which was 'okay'.",4,2016,07,10
249,Family break,"Very spacious bedrooms with fantastic facilities available ie mini fridge/safe/fans and much more!!Also very tasty breakfast with great choice  and value
Also very friendly and helpful staff
Keenly priced",5,2016,07,09
249,"Great service, excellent friendly staff","Arrived at hotel to find there had been a mix up with our room, but the problem was dealt with quickly and efficiently by the receptionist. We were moved to a executive suite at no extra cost.
Friendly cleaning staff and room clean. Plenty of choice from buffet breakfast.
Hotel located well for shopping and Dublin zoo. Plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby.
Only down side to this hotel is don't expect a room with a view.",5,2016,07,09
249,Disappointed,"Nice hotel but rooms are definitely not 4star, when we arrived there was a terrible smell from the bathroom, we were told that the drains were being cleaned, now the smell went but only to return later in the night. No air-conditioning which is disappointing also. Staff were lovely as was food. Very much a business/tourist hotel as opposed to family hotel.",3,2016,07,07
249,Staff not very helpful or friendly!!,"Stayed here with my family, it was our break-away for our summer holiday, Got there early but didn't realise check-in wasn't till 3, so had to go away and come back again at 3. When we got to the check-in, was told you only booked a double room for 2 of ye. Thankfully i had the e-mail to prove i had booked a family room and requested a cot. She had no family room for us- but said that a room with a double bed and single bed was available and she would send the cot. Great i said- had to ask about the kids club- didn't tell us anything about the leisure centre, pool, where the kds club was on, or where to eat etc, got to the room, with a tired 1 year old who needed a nap. In the room there was a double bed and a couch- a couch that turns into a bed- ye gave no bed clothes, pillows or anything for my child. Also when you pull that out there is no room for a cot. Went back down to reception to say we wanted a family room, seeing as we booked and paied for it. Was told there is no family room, come back in an hour's time and there should be one then- told her it's after 3pm, there has to be a family room available, i needed to put my 1 year old for a nap- amazing she was able to find one for me. The way yere website says spacious family room - definetly not true. The next day our card wouldn't work so my husband went down to fix it- ques were going out near the door because a bus load of people were checkung in. He went to a guy near the desk and said it to him and the guy said join the bak of the que!!! Food in hotel is really not suitable and very expensive for families. Checking out waiting again- gave a €50 deposit for room and never have i been told to take a seat and wait for it to get it back- they had to go check the room first. So disapointed with my stay and would not recommend for families to stay here. Definetly will not be returning!",2,2016,07,05
249,Very friendly and excellent staff,"Stayed in this hotel with the family for a short break recently as it is so close to shops and other attractions, check in was very smooth and friendly, room was just perfect but the only problem was the heat, even with window open and fan on, and the weather outside was not great !  Breakfast was perfect, dinner in the Italian restaurant and Oriental restaurant was delicious and we had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay....will be back again soon.

249,Could be better,"Spent 3 nights here with the family, amenities were good. We like the play area for the kids and reasonable priced food in the restaurants, but the weak wifi in our room was a disappointment. We have to go to the reception area to get signal. Also, the coffee they serve during breakfast was pretty bad. Minor points only.",3,2016,07,03
249,Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,"The rooms are a decent size and quite comfortable.  I looks like it is the first choice for organised coach trips and as a result it was busy at times with large numbers of tourists checking in and out each day. Housekeeping was therefore under pressure - they wanted to clean my room at 5.30pm... After a long day I decided to eat in the hotel restaurant only to find that the main one (Gusto) was closed and therefore anyone wishing to eat had to use the smaller restaurant (Kudos Bar).  Service was very slow and it took quite a while to order and get food.  Getting a drink took even longer! Whilst the food was ok it was typically not great value as is the case with most 'captive' hotel restaurants.  The restaurant was extremely busy with families and small children and at times (well most of the time) it was like trying to eat a meal in a Wacky Warehouse play centre.  Do yourself a favour and eat over the road in the ARC bar.  Overall the rooms are good, the restaurants are not so good.",3,2016,06,30
249,Fab stay in Clarion...,"Myself, my husband and son stayed for 3 nights in this hotel last weekend and we have to contradict what the last two reviews say.  We had a fab stay.  I know yes that one lift was out of order but we didn't really have to wait too long for the lift to arrive and on a couple of occasions took the stairs right next to it when we had no bags...we were on holidays so weren't in any great hurry.

We found the staff at all times to be very nice and totally friendly and very welcoming to us and especially my little 4 year old boy.  There was a queue at reception when we first arrived but another member of staff arrived soon after and understandably so as it is Summer and one of the busiest times.  It was our wedding anniversary and I had mentioned this when booking and we arrived to our beautiful room to find that we had been upgraded and a lovely welcoming 'Happy Anniversary' note hand written to us and chocolates too!

We found the swimming pool to be very clean and well run and we did plan on attending the playground but the weather didn't allow and we had other things planned too.  I would definitely recommend staying and like to thank Martina and the staff for making our stay thoroughly enjoyable.",4,2016,06,29
249,Terrible service throughout,"Just checked out this morning from this hotel. I cannot get over the poor standard of service for a 4 star hotel. On check in no details given about leisure centre, playground for kids etc. Only one lift in operation on either side of hotel  which led to long waiting time. Waited ten minutes in morning to get down one floor with buggy bags and two impatient children. 
The bedroom smelt damp and obviously hadn't been cleaned properly as there was food crumbs and an orange pip under the chai when we checked in. The toilet handle broke on first use. This was reported to reception and was told someone would fix it but nobody arrived to fix so my husband ended up fixing it himself a few hours later. 
The restaurant was fully booked but we were advised by reception that we could order  from both menus in the bar as we were on a package. 
In the bar was only asian cuisine and waiter said that was the only menu we could order from which was fine for us as not fussy food wise but im sure that would be an issue for others. The service was so slow but in fairness to the waiter he seemed to be the only person serving tables. At one stage there was about 4 people standing behind the bar chatting , two of which appeared to be managers dressed in suits, while the one waiter tryed to manage everything himself. An absolute disgrace. 
My husband paid for parking on arrival at reception but when we went to exit ,it said return to paystation, he had to turn car and go back up to reception. No apology passed by receptionist for not validating the ticket even those it was him that had taken payment and almost reacted like it was something my husband should have known about. 
All in all a bad experience and wouldn't most likely not return! ",2,2016,06,26
249,Disappointing,"We booked 3 nights. Signs were not good when we checked in and both lifts up to our room were out of order (1 remained out of order for the whole of our stay). 

Room was unbearably hot to the point it disturbed our sleep every night (even with the fan provided and window open - which then let in noise from the motorway which the hotel was next to). I normally have no issues with waking up in the night. Air conditioning vents seemed to be present in our room but there was no control panel. 

Breakfast each morning was frustrating. Each time I had to chase the staff for something (replacement tea cups that were missing, the pot of tea we had been offered, refilling the milk jug that was empty every time). In itself this was not a major deal but was irritating especially when we paid €150/night. 

We had stayed in another Clarion for 2 nights immediately prior to this and it was far superior. Disappointing and unlikely to return.

249,I would avoid to stay there,"The food is extremely expensive and bad. The worst thing is that the rooms don't have an a/c and I almost die from the heat. The service is bad, I was trying to contact reception for 20 minutes without any luck.",2,2016,06,22
249,Much better than I had hoped for.,"We got mixed messages from people who had stayed here, so didn't know what to expect.  Check in was very speedy. My daughter and her family were also staying, and we checked in one after the other, to find we'd been allocated side by side apartments, rather than rooms. This was a real blessing, as my grandson has special needs, and gets bored easily. 
 Every facility is in these spacious one bedroomed apartments,  including a washing machine and a dishwasher. My daughter's apartment was laid out differently,  with a bed settee as well as the double bedroom.  The basics of tea and coffee were there too, and a snacks and drinks machine on the ground floor. We had the best sleep,  undisturbed by slamming doors or rowdy revellers.  We had a meal in the bar after we arrived; service was a bit slow, but food was reasonable.  Overall,  a really good experience,  including check out, where the receptionist seemed really interested in our opinions.",4,2016,06,22
249,Easy location,"We chose this hotel because we wanted to be close to the airport. Rooms were comfortable, good free breakfast, spacious underground parking for 6€.  It was close to a mall where we had a few choices for dinner.  Nothing special but a good value for our needs.",4,2016,06,22
249,Business overnight ,"Location of the hotel is about 20min outside Dublin city centre. Other than that the hotel is ok, cost effective room service was great . Ideal for families. Receptionist was lovely . Clean tidy decent size rooms couldn't ask for much more....",4,2016,06,22
249,Superb stay!,"We spent 2nights here to incorporate an ikea visit, a Dublin zoo visit and a puppy viewing. I have no idea where to start. The room was great, clean and comfortable, fridge for the baby's bottles, bath etc. Nothing was too much for the staff and Jane is an absolute asset to the team. Use of pool over 2days was most welcome. Their restaurant staff could be better but they are Gusto not Clarion. Worth a visit and we'd stay again ",5,2016,06,22
249,"Clean, friendly, too far out of city centre","Arrived very early but room ready, clean and tidy no air con warmish in room..
Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Couldn't fault them. The breakfast was expensive for what it was ....
Sadly it is too far out to revisit, long bus rides or very expensive taxi fares..",4,2016,06,20
249,Good Price but far from the downtown,We took an airport shuttle to get there. It is farther than I expected. Our room was not ready. We went to the city by Hop on and Hop up. The bus goes there once a day at 10 am and at 4:30 pm .It was fantastic. We bought tickets before we went there.  I think is better for a large groups of people. We got our room.  A little small but clean and very comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom was large and a good shower. The breakfast was very poor and expensive. Few choices of food. Only fake scramble eggs and beacon (called hot food) then cereal and some pastries. There is a coffee shop in the lobby. It makes a great latte.  If you don't have a car you must be very familiar with the public transportation. We found a bus a couple of blocks from the hotel. Bus is very reliable but expensive about $ 5.00 each way. If I go again to Dublin I will try to stay closer to the city center. NO AIR CONDITIONER!!!!!,3,2016,06,19
249,Clarion class,"We have stayed here a few times when visiting Dublin on shopping trips , Very close to Liffey valley shopping center.Rooms are spacious , clean and have all amenities , tv, hair dryer, tea making.Staff are  always friendly , plenty of parking , beside the hotel or in the underground car park , Good food in the bar.",4,2016,06,19
249,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!!,"Ok so the rooms are clean and functional, but what makes this hotel is its staff!!! I was scheduled to meet my sister there and I hadn't seen her in months as I live in NY. She had checked in before me, I had spotted her in the lounge and wanted to surprise her. I explained to the front desk clerk and even though she was really busy she took the time to go to my sister and request that she come to the desk to take a call. I then got the opportunity to surprise her. It was such a lovely gesture from the front desk. I work in the business so I was observing the service during my two night stay. On one occasion an elderly gentleman was being given information about his departure the following morning and his journey to the airport ( this hotel is ideally situated for the airport) I think the girl at the desk spent at least 20 minutes repeating and reassuring the man that he would get to the airport in plenty of time. I really felt that the staff went over and beyond what they was required. Top class. We ate the restaurant the food was really good and again the service was excellent, as was breakfast!!",5,2016,06,16
249,Short but pleasant stay,"Only stayed the one night as couldn't get something closer to the office, that being said the location isn't bad, the shopping centre is a 10 minute walk away and has plenty of places to eat etc. Also only takes 25 minutes to get into the centre of Dublin. 
Hotel rooms were what you would expect of a hotel of this size, spacious and clean, with everything you need. Only thing to maybe say is that the shower could do with an update, but there were no negatives to our stay. 
Positive would definitely be the staff - everyone we spoke to were welcoming and helpful, asking if it was our first trip to Dublin, and advising good places to go etc. 
The free wireless was also really good, great connection and speed, making our stay a lot easier!
Overall a short but enjoyable stay. Would stay again.",4,2016,06,16
249,An Excellent Hotel,"For our last night in Ireland we stayed a The Clarion and it was excellent. It is a large and busy hotel and yet we were welcomed and our room was fantastic. We were on the lower ground floor so no view, but that did not matter. The room was large, the facilities were good and the bed was very comfortable. Dinner was good with a choice of main courses, starters but a standard sweet which was very nice. We had a very early start with breakfast at 6 a.m. and the meal was very good. It was buffet style self service. Overall the hotel was excellent and memorable.",5,2016,06,15
249,Handy Location to City,"My wife and I stayed here recently as we had a family event on in Dublin. It's location made for easy access by car and a reasonable taxi ride (€20) to the city. 

The cost of the room with breakfast was very good, even allowing for taxi and distance from city it was still economical.  Breakfast was very good.  We had a family room which had a queen size bed and 2 singles. Tea & coffee facilities and a bar fridge were good.

If I has to pick one negative it would be. The ground floor rooms in the far wing from reception facing the car park can be noisy very early in the morning. On both mornings numerous tour buses along with their drivers, passengers and luggage got quite noisy and woke me very early both mornings.

Overall we would stay here again albeit not in those same rooms.",4,2016,06,14
249,Lovely !,"we were booked in for one night the Friday of the bank holiday weekend. when we arrived the hotel was very busy . we were told we were being upgraded to the Clarian Suites beside the hotel. That was lovely as we had a small fridge and microwave oven. My daughter preferred it to the hotel as we had a sitting room and balcony and cool drinks on tap !! If I was going again for a weekend I would definitely consider the suite . It was spotlessly clean, very quiet and very comfortable - the standard has never dropped at this hotel. we ate in the Bar and were served by a wonderful waitress Coco , she was so helpful with choices off the menu and very attentive to my daughter. She was super busy but we were checked on regularly. she's excellent.   the pool was busy on the Saturday morning as baby swim classes were taking place but it was well managed. Biggest issue is drivers not parking their cars in their designated spaces in the car park and taking up 2 spots  (the spaces are tight enough). Check out was slow as only one lad on his own when I went to check out but a lady came alone and she rounded up another staff member so things sped up. I love this hotel for its proximity to shopping and its relaxing rooms. cant fault it at all.",5,2016,06,13
249,Nithing good / nothing bad b,"Decent place for one or two nights. Spacious and clean rooms with everyting you need. Good breakfast , if you like "" fool irish "". Helpful and attending staff at the reception and in the restaurant. In the bar you can find quite a good choice of beers. Location could be better but all in all good place for a short stay. ",3,2016,06,12
249,"Good Hotel, V busy, shopping nearby, a good 20 mins from City but worth price they ask.","The Clarion is  a good hotel option, always busy. Breakfast very good, lots of seating. Restaurant at night v busy so book at check in. Reception area can be slow moving, Parking 3 euro. Liffey Valley Shopping Center a 6-7 min walk away. Bus to town nearby but would really want a car if doing the city. Still its great value if you can get a good deal - would really suit families as lots nearby for smallies and great pizza restaurant.",4,2016,06,11
249,Good location. No Individual room A/C,"We stayed here for a few days while we were exploring Dublin before we headed west.
The hotel is in a very convenient location right off the highway as well as very near the Liffey shopping center. (think US mall like, with a Marks and & Spencers). There are also several restaurants and grocery stores nearby. 
If you drive make sure that you visit the eflow.ie site to pay or prepay the m50 tolls.

Location, again very good.
Room size: decent
Amenities: Good
Breakfast: Did not use
Gym; Good size, regular gym, a bit overused and not that well regulated.
Pool: Good, pool-cap required. You can buy one for 3 euro if you do not have one.
Parking: 6 euro/night
Internet; Free and no issues.
Restaurant/Bar: on-site, dDd not use.
Room location/Noise: Pretty loud, which is due to the room not having an individual A/C unit. There is only central air, (think building wise) and it was not turned on. There fore the window was open (just a tiny bit possible and the traffic noise was loud.)

Again, due to the central air and no individual a/c room units, the rooms are hot. The central air was not turned on. We asked for a fan and it was delivered quickly. 
This a/c issue may not be an issue for some people however it can be for others as it greatly diminishes the stay quality.

So in short, on a cool day a great stay with a great location. On a warm day, with no a/c turned on, I rather go somewhere else.
I gave it 3 stars due to the a./c issue, otherwise it would be a 4.",3,2016,06,11
249,Disappointing,"This was our second visit. We went back because our first visit last year was enjoyable. First of all, there was only one lift working and the other lift had two of the push buttons missing for the different floors. Also the silver strip at the bottom of the floor where the door opens was up at one side. I dont know how someone had not triped over it.The room was lovely, but I think the staff were under pressure because the drink glasses were not taken away and the cushions were left on the floor and not put back on the bed. Then they had a karaoke in the bar at tea time and the noise was awful. The meal was tasteless and the wait was inexcusable . Then in the morning you had to wait for the lady ticking off room numbers to also show people to the table as well and then come back and do the next family.  We were waiting in a line of about twenty . Never again, even if it was free. The hotel was full, so they should have more staff on or else for the managers to come out of their offices and take care of business.",2,2016,06,09
249,Avoid ,"Bad

No air con (this sucked the most)
No mini bar fridge (unstocked)
No bottled water
Bedding not changed
Shower head fixed to the wall. Not working and spitting to the ceiling
Swimming pool not useable, too many visitors
Breakfast mediocre

Good
Room size
Room has safe
Room has interconnecting doors for family.

Taxis booked with reception were always late and unreliable

249,Romantic getaway/Springsteen concert!,"Stayed in the clarion on Friday 27th for the weekend with my husband. We were in Dublin for the Bruce Springsteen concert on the Friday. Return bus to the concert was great! Arrived at the hotel before 5 to go to our room only to open the door to a wee hallway of lit candles n rose petals. Further into the room more rose petals n candles, chocolates & strawberries, a bottle of wine on ice & a beautiful bunch of roses & lilies!!! A huge huge big thank u to the wonderful Martina who set up the room in cahoots with my hubby!!! She did an amazing job!! Room was fab really comfortable & we really enjoyed our weekend at the Clarion 👍😀",5,2016,06,08
249,2 night stay for appointment for hospital,"stayed many times here, had different rooms,  upper floors are the best, 
1st time was lower ground floor,  0ne word - terrible.  also stayed in upper floors for 2 night stay, they are very comfortable.   staff friendly, food good.",4,2016,06,06
249,stayed a full week for business,"Stayed here recently for business for  a week. The room was big and the bed really comfortable but the best thing about this hotel is the staff-all of the ones I encountered.From reception to restaurant they were exceptional-friendly and helpful with a sense of humour,One of them even remembered me from a previous visit.Impressive considering the hotel was full.",4,2016,06,05
249,Don't bother.,Charge you for parking in their car park even tho you have paid to stay in their hotel 😂😂 What a joke! And don't forget swim hats or that's another 3 euro each...   needless to say won't be back and anyone will be warned not to bother. ,2,2016,06,05
249,Excellent customer service leading to an unforgettable experience!,"My wife, son and I recently booked a family room (No 629) for an overnight stay in this 4 star hotel. While the bedroom was up to the expected standard, the bathroom regrettably wasn't, with the enamel in the bath chipped badly, tiles missing from the shower facing wall and what appeared to be a growth in the area of the bath where one would stand if having a shower. The pedestal basin in the bathroom was also blocked and would not drain.

So, we complained to reception and, without much ado, we were offered apartment no 585, for no additional charge, which was superb.

There is a large size pool in the hotel, along with sauna, jacuzzi and steam room facilities. On the day of my visit the steam room was not in operation.

I have to say, the staff at this hotel are genuine about providing great customer service, and I believe that you never really know this until something goes wrong and you see first hand how the staff deal with it.

There are two restaurants in the hotel - an Italian Restaurant (Gusto's) and also one (Kudos) that offers European and Asian dishes. We chose the Italian restaurant and I can tell you we weren't disappointed. The restaurant staff are courteous and nothing is too much trouble. My wife is a coeliac (needs gluten free food) and so there was quite a long wait while the kitchen staff prepared her dish. That said, at least, the long wait gave us the assurance that her food was being prepared gluten free, however, a shorter waiting period would be even better!!

Overall, on this occasion, the staff dealt with my complaint in a courteous and professional manner and I would have no hesitation in giving this hotel my business again in the future as they take customer service very seriously indeed. Well done Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley!! An unforgettable stay!",5,2016,06,05
249,Close to The Hermitage Medical Centre.,"Booked a family room to accommodate my two daughters and myself whilst my son was having surgery at the Hermitage. Check in was straightforward, pleasant receptionist. The room was clean, had a bath & shower and a fridge.  Thought it a bit small for a family room, compared to other hotels I have stayed in. My son's partner & her mother booked a double room for the same stay. When I saw their double room I was a bit surprised. Both rooms were exactly the same size, same facilities so I then realised why our ""family"" room seemed cramped. Quite a long walk from reception to the room. Parking charges for car park -  honestly don't feel that residents should have to pay for parking. Didn't eat in the hotel but had a drink in the bar one night and paid 30 euro for a cheap bottle of wine - saw the exact same wine up the road in Aldi for 5.99 euro????  This is an extremely busy hotel. Probably its location makes it a handy stopover. The location suited us for the purpose of our stay.",3,2016,06,05
249,Cheap and cheerful hotel for business stay,"I've stayed at the Clarion 20+ times in the last 2 years.  It is pretty good value for the price of the room but nothing extra special.  The restaurants are nice, staff are friendly and helpful.  Some nights there was lots of noise in corridors and be aware that if you are in one of the rooms farthest from reception then it will take you an age to walk to your room!",3,2016,06,03
249,great area service at breakfast was the best only 1 thing wrong with the hotel,the service at breakfast tim was so fantastic it has been the first hotel that asked me if i needed help getting breakfast as im wheelchair bound it was fantastic as my husband and i could eat at the same time so id give the hotel a 5/5 for the staff.The only problem i had and it is a big issue for us is that none of the hotel rooms have airconditioning there is just a large fan that makes a lot of noise and because of my health condition i can get very bad hot sweats and i can faint from it very quickly  if i cant be cooled down i would have given the hotel a 4 1/2 out of 5 if there had been airconditioning,3,2016,06,01
249,What an upgrade!,I had booked a twin room and said we would be booking in after 7pm. When we got there around 9pm we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who upgraded us to a suite. The suite was nearly as big as my house! Each of us got our own kingsize bedroom and bathroom.  We were served in the restaurant around 9.30pm no problem. We didn't hear a sound all night and in the morning we had breakfast in the room as it had a full working kitchen and dining table for 8 !!. The whole place was really clean and comfortable and we received complimentary car parking as well. The hotel is perfectly situated for anyone coming from the West. Staying there was a very pleasant experience and I would highly recommend it. The suite we stayed in was so big it would suit a large family or 6 adults easily.,5,2016,06,01
249,Good Home Base,"I stayed here recently with a group of friends for a long weekend in Dublin. The hotel was nice and clean, and we got the family rooms that fit 4 each. The location was pretty far from the city center so you would always have to take a cab into town, but it was usually never more than 25 euros and you could take the bus for cheaper. The beds weren't the most comfortable and the shower water changes temperature while you are showering but all in all, it was a good stay. The staff was nice and helpful and there is a mall within walking distance that is very convenient.",4,2016,05,31
249,Hotel room & breakfast was perfect but rest of the experience was not!,"We arrived on Sunday 29th at 2.40pm and stood in line to check-in for 30mins.

Ate in the hotel bar. When I stood at the bar the server asked what I wanted, I ordered Fish&Chips and Lasagne&Chips, I was informed there was no Fish&Chips so I ordered 2 Lasagne's. He nodded & walked away. The next I see him delivering food to 2 different tables. He comes back to the bar and has to ask me for my order again. Then disappears. A few minutes later he returned and seemed surprised to see me still standing there. He then asked ""Oh, did you want drinks with your order?"" I responded that I did and asked for a Pinot of Grigio & a pint of Guiness. He disappears for another few minutes then has to ask me what my drink order was again!!!

Our food arrived and my partners lasagne was freezing cold. It gets returned and was replaced for FIFTEEN minutes. I had finished my meal and we were even offered discount/a free drink for the inconvenience. So not the greatest of customer service.

When it came to checking out, even though when I checked in the receptionist confirmed my booking had been prepaid there seemed to be an issue upon checking out as I had to email proof of this!!!",1,2016,05,30
249,Good hotel,"We only stayed here for one night and can only say good things about our experience.we were a party of 2adults and2 children and our room which consisted of a double bed and 2 singles was more than comfortable for us.Both the room and bathroom were nice and clean and had everything from hair dryer to iron ,all you need really.we had dinner in the gusto restaurantwhich was really nice and breakfast also which had a good choice for everyone.just a few minutes walk away was a big shopping centre if thats your thing with lots of different shops to keep you busy.we would defo return again only for a bit longer thistime.Staff were all friendly and polite ,couldnt ask for more really.Carpark was 6€ for a day ,hardly bank breaking.Thanks clarion good job",4,2016,05,29
249,Work related trip to Ireland... Multi week  stay in Apartment,"So far, so good.... This place offers both Hotel rooms and Apartment suites. (Bedroom/Living area/small kitchenette/bathroom)..  I'm on the 5th floor, but not really since over here they start the ground floor off as floor #0....  I've been here for over two weeks now.... Every time I've gone to the front desk to ask a question they have been very helpful with finding an answer to my question or resolving any issue I may have.",4,2016,05,29
249,Very good,"Stayed at the clarion last night, basic hotel to be honest but very clean room, staff on check in and out and the night staff were all very nice and friendly! Def worth staying easy parking loads of taxis and bus to airport is excellent! Great leisure centre, didn't eat there but everything else is top class.",4,2016,05,29
249,Handy for airport stopover,"Stayed here to catch early morning flight with our 7mth old daughter. Very accommodating by having travel cot ready for us. Good breakfast but be prepared to que a few minutes. 6euro car park, free wifi,",5,2016,05,28
249,Lovely hotel great location,"This is a lovely hotel, arrived late from Dublin Airport, friendly staff on the desk had pre-booked a double room and they were full and put us in the suites!! Wow these are fantastic and a great facility.  Very clean hotel. Everything you could want. Ideal for a group of 4 going on a shopping trip for a few days. ",4,2016,05,27
249,Average Hotel,"The Hotel is located close to the highway. overall Average Hotel. breakfast is  served also have 2 restaurants. car park with payment, there is a Gym   with indoor swimming pool.
rooms are OK some rooms can be far from the reception",3,2016,05,27
249,"Big hotel, too hot and too noisy","On arrival, I had to queue quite a while to get attended. For a hotel this big they are running fairly short on check in staff.
I was offered an “upgrade” to an apartment which I didn’t really want. Once I’d agreed to it and had finalised the paperwork I was told that you couldn’t order room service from there!

The room was a good size, with a big bed. However the bed was very poorly made and I had to strip the bed and remake to make it comfortable.

The apartment side was OK (I only went in to see what it is like) however the kitchen part is only any good if you want to use the microwave, there is no oven or stove top.

The room was very hot and with the window open very noisy from the road alongside. The air conditioning did not work (it gave some error message).

Another disadvantage of the apartment is that you have to work through the rain (it is Ireland) to get to the main building where the restaurant is.

Had dinner at the restaurant which was good, although a bit slow serving. Breakfast was good.

At check-out I found that I had somebody else’s bar-bill on my account, not very impressive record keeping.",3,2016,05,27
249,"Big hotel, big and noisy hallways","In Dublin for business, the Clarion looked like a good value (quality - price) hotel. The price was nice indeed, and the rooms clean and big. But t was way too noisy in the night, due to the numerous groups in the hallways. I had a room on the first flor, and the buses stopped right below my door. I had 2 nights of poor sleep. The breakfast is nice, but the dinner very deceiving",3,2016,05,26
249,Great base for a Dublin stay,"We stayed in the hotel. Room was fine, clean. It is a long walk to some of the rooms so do take notice of this if you have mobility issues. Staff were great - very welcoming and accommodating. The bar is not great - just not a comfortable area to relax in. It could do with remodelling. Breakfast selection was good. However 2 negatives. Pastries were stale on Friday morning and were from the previous day (A sticker labelling them said ""Thursday"".). And there is no tea/coffee served to the table. The coffee was from a canister. I would stay again. As I said in the title, it is a great base if you have a car.",4,2016,05,25
249,Not a pleasant experience.,"From the very beginning, I knew I was'nt booking a luxurious hotel, simply beacuse of the location/price. But I would have never imagine not being able to sleep until 3am! 
I travel a lot, I've spent several months in 3-d world countries, yet never had such a dissapointing experience. Apperantly, there is a night club right next to the hotel, and drunk people wander around the hotel doing what ever their drunk mood tells them to. I've called the recepion to complain and said that I can hear drunk people laughing and singing. The receptionist simply said that he does'nt believe me, and if I want to prove it, he can come to my room. As a young woman in sleeping clothes (3am for god's sake) I was'nt willing to let a strange men walk into my room. Such a disturbing suggestion. 
I wonder if there are rules against noise in Ireland? there must be something against drunk people making noise in the middle of the night! 
So after begging the rude clerck to do something he said ""there is nothing I can do about it"". 
Other thing travelers might find interesting:
Towels are always dirty with stains. You ask for a fresh one, and it also comes stained. 
Bathtub has weird black marks in it. 
Dirty carpets, and overall, the room was not once cleaned properly. 

Bottom line- don't waste your money at the Clarion, you probably can find a better place, this one is a JOKE.",1,2016,05,23
249,One Night Break,A last minute booking was made. First time staying here. The hotel was lovely. Very quick check in. Staff were very friendly. Our room was on the motor way side of the hotel and there was a lot of traffic all night so there was a lot of noise but that had nothing to do with the hotel. Breakfast was lovely and the staff were brilliant. Would I stay again yes I would . You have to pay for parking at the hotel,4,2016,05,22
249,Gusto restaurant is excellent,"Stayed here for one night. Really close to the m50 so very easy to get to. Rooms were clean and functional. We ate in Gusto restaurant and it was excellent the pizzas were very very good and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good to, good selection of both hot and cold food.",4,2016,05,21

Great facilities Bar/Restaurant/Pool/Sauna/Steam room/onsite parking
Free wifi - the list goes on.
I will continue to return",5,2016,05,20
249,Excellent Stay in a very well Run Hotel,"Travelled as a family 2 adults 2 children. 
The hotel is well positioned just outside Dublin, 10 mins on the Bus, which picks up very close by. 
The staff here are all top of the pile. Everything was an option and even the food was excellent. Really cant say any more. It was great",5,2016,05,18
249,Stingy,"Hotel looks great but...
Even though the rooms were ready, they made us wait 3 hours before doing anything (never offered to store luggage so we could leave). Had to wait in the lobby. When first turned on, the shower water was brown. Walls paper thin - was able to hear the TV on in the next room at 3 a.m.
Only one towel allotted per person. Construction going on outside the window.",2,2016,05,18
249,Again in Dublin,"Stayed at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley   Airport bus (after eventually finding the stop !! ) from the airport to the front door of the hotel , same also for the return. very good Although a little isolated and 20 mins. or so by bus from Dublin , The Hotel was very good , very clean , good food , with  helpful staff throughout .Next door is a fitness centre  that guests have the use of.
Nearby only several minutes walk is Liffey Valley shopping centre  ,lots of shops and good places to eat Found a great Bar there, Fridays American bar . Friendly staff and good food and drink , it had only opened the day before.  No Setanta sport on TV !! surely that must come soon ? AND they close at 10pm !! Good that the Clarion had a good bar !  
Journey to Dublin was by bus , a 10 min walk and cross over the motorway footbridge, OK if its not raining and you can walk easily ! Coming back was easier as the stop was just below the hotel .Make sure you have the correct fare as you do not get change at all !!!So a couple of euros ride can cost you a lot !",5,2016,05,18
249,Stayed in Hotel and Apartments - Average,"Stayed here on a business trip. I worked nights and froze during the day. They turn off the heat during the day. They do have portable heaters, but this shows very little regard for their customers and they are not the cheapest. I transferred to the apartments so I could do some cooking and washing myself. Big surprise - no range, just a microwave and fridge. No dish or laundry soap. I had to go out and buy housekeeping supplies. I stayed at the Premier Suites early this year and supplies were included and they they had a range top. They do have a good breakfast buffet. The road noise is very bad if your room is on that side. This was the only hotel that was available on the company's approved list otherwise I would not stay here.",3,2016,05,17
249,great stay,This was a fantastic stay in a great hotel.Very friendly staff was looking after us very well during the whole weekend.especially lovely Lucia.Great food also available.Thanks very much.recommend to all.,5,2016,05,16
249,Perfect stay,"Great hotel couldnt fault anything, we stayed in room 515 which was perfect good size clean and a safe which was at no extra cost, two on site restaurants we tried the Gusto which was great quality food theres also and asian restaurant on site, Gym and pool sauna/steam room on site at no extra cost. Good location only a short walk to bus stop which takes you right into the city centre 10-15min journey and also a shuttle bus from the airport that takes you right outside the hotel and will take you back to airport runs 7days a week highly recommend using this cost me 36 euros return for two people where as a taxi would be around 30 euros one way, We will definitely be coming back to dublin great city to vist and will be using the Clarion again.",4,2016,05,16
249,Great place to stay,"Arrived at hotel and greeted by lovely lady on reception we arrived early and were very pleased to find our room ready. Our room 512 was big and had everything we needed tea/coffee facilities, tv, hair drier and a fridge. Everything was clean and for a standard room was excellent. Breakfast was plentiful and good ingredients we paid 13 euro and we helped ourselves to as much as we wanted from the buffet. All staff are helpful and the management should feel proud that for us, their staff all did a great job. The hotel is a little way from Dublin city but a no 40 bus costing 3.30euro can be found within a 10 minute walk. Car parking at the hotel is 6 euro per day and you can park up and pay at reception. The only downside which was not the hotels fault there is a night club nearby and revellers were very noisy in the early hours but we solved the problem close the window.
Would defiantly stay here again",5,2016,05,14
249,Great to be recognised,"I stay on average once a week. And other hotels the rest of the week so I see a lot of hotel rooms. One of the frustrating questions is, have you stayed with us before? Especially if I've been there the previous week. I don't think anybody expects anyone to remember every repeat guest but use the computer system to check before asking. So fair play to Ashleigh for remembering me. Clean room, good food in the restaurant for dinner (pizza +++) Also, fair play to Res Manager Miriam for being nice on the phone helping with my bookings.",5,2016,05,12
249,ok stay,"arrived at hotel and to check in, 1st person female was standing there but sent me to the next desk who was a young male, he had absolutely no interested in checking me in. He never even looked up at me nor a welcome; just waved his hand to go to the 3 rd girl he was so rude. I should have got onto him as I would normally but I was tired. So I found my self with 3rd person who was Irish with glasses (I am sorry didn't catch her name) but she was very polite, she upgraded me to an apartment was very nice and enjoyed it. Hotel was clean and surrounded by restaurants and the shopping centre. There is loads to do. checking out was a different story, again same rude. I do not know how they have him on front-line, I would have him cleaning the rooms. I was passed again to a girl and asked her to validate my parking ticket which was 6 euros. I was never told on check in parking was to be paid, I know its only 6 euros but its the principle. I have stayed in many hotels around there and parking is free. She replied to me the sign was on the meter as you drive in, talk about rude and ignorant, you are watching your driving and expected to see a small sign (get out of it). very disappointed with treatment from from desk and very disappointed with parking fee. Hotel restaurant in bar needs a better manager as it just lacked management as staff were not helpful of cleaning tables or interested in you as a customer, we stood for 20 mins and left. Pool staff excellent people and pool spotless. 
Poor stay.",3,2016,05,10
249,Pay for parking?!,"First off staff paying to park makes no sense that residents of the hotel paying to stay there have to pay for parking ?!?

And now for the good part , Ashley at reception is so nice and works really hard and did everything with a smile and the hotel in general looked very good ",3,2016,05,08
249,Great again,"Second stay at this hotel last weekend. Again didnt disappoint. Very pleasant girl at check in. room great and spotless. Had meal in the bar on sat night and service was great.  Food was absolutely beautiful. Then, three man acoustic band who were brilliant. Best band ive head in years. One little problem in that the room next door had a family and a very noisy one at that, whose children started the biggest racket ever the following morning for about two hours. But thats more their parents fault than the hotels.  Pool beautiful and changing rooms are spotless with lovely warm very private showers. Would just say that we thought paid parking was a bit disappointing.  However, wouldnt put me off staying again.  Its a Fabulous hotel with great staff, great food and great entertainment.",5,2016,05,07
249,Very disappointed ,My sister lives in lucan and is a regular visitor to the clarion hotel we have lots of party's here over the years. Last night we decided to come down for a meal with our children. The service was great but the food was disgraceful l had the chicken and blackbean it was cold sauce was like water in a boil . My sisters meal was greasy crispy chicken and served cold the children's noodles was soaking in grease l would not serve this rubbish to my dog ..no ice was put into our drinks . ,2,2016,05,07
249,Great for kids,"Really friendly helpful staff. We've stayed here loads of times. Lovely pool. Some nice play areas for small kids. The rooms are very very warm. Too warm. The only negative was I asked for a quiet room location and we were put right beside a door that was a fire door, intersecting 2 long corridors right beside the lifts. People were going through it all day and night and it made an unmerciful bang every time. It woke me a few times. Other than that it's a great place, lovely food in Gustos. The breakfast was really good too. ",4,2016,05,04
249,Lucan boxing club multi counties boxing show,"We booked the Pegasus room for our boxing show for 2 days. It was a perfect size to fit 2 rings and about 400 people comfortably . We had clubs from all over Ireland that attended our tournament. It was a great success and the facilities at the hotel were excellent. The staff were very helpful, friendly and professional and in particular Gary was on hand to look after us. He is  very courteous and helpful and an asset to your hotel. We would definitely use this hotel again for future tournaments.",5,2016,05,03
249,Excellent stay,"We arrived late at the hotel as we got held up and late check in was no problem for the hotel as we rang ahead. When we arrived at the hotel we checked into our room which was very clean and modern, we then went down to the bar where a 3 man band were playing called tropical storm- would highly recommend this band as they were very friendly, they took requests from everyone in the bar which gave a bit of humour and fun, did not get food as late check in but the food smelt good and looked good as we were sitting in the bar. The bed was very comfy, room could not be faulted. Had problems with parking meter on departure but the staff at reception quickly resolved our problem. Very close to the Liffey valley shopping center which was ideal (2min drive).Will definitely be back in the future",5,2016,05,02
249,Overnight at the Clarion,"Checkin was quick easy and staff polite!

Ate in their Gusto Italian Restaurant, we had a pasta dish lasagne and il Dievole Pizza

All good presentation of Lasagne was excellent

Only criticisms were lack of choice of Italian wine on menu and the espresso was served in a big cup but was a perfect measure unlike a lot of places! 

Sharon our waiter was pleasant and efficient.
 
Rooms were clean comfortable and tidy although friends room was a little dated and needs a bit of work with painting AC and drapes

Breakfast was the usual buffet and was good, great orange juice, coffee a bit weak!",4,2016,05,02
249,Very little sleep,"My wife and I along with our three children stayed here on our first ever trip to Ireland. We found the location just perfect for our trip, only 200 yards from the Liffey shopping complex and just outside of Dublin. When we arrived at 14.00 we had to queue for 20 minutes to book in and get keys for our rooms, one room was ready but the kids room was still being cleaned but i was told the key for that room would be sent up, but after four hours still no key, so i went down to reception to ask for the key but the young chap could not find the registration form that i had signed earlier and after about seven minutes i was given the key. Not a good start but the two bedrooms were nice, the hotel has a pool and gym but we never got to see them as we had a busy schedule and decided to go to bed at 22.00 and thats when the problems started. Unfortunately the night we where staying, the place was full of ignorant people with no respect or thought for others. Kids were running up and down the long corridors shouting and at one point one of their fathers swearing at them at the top of his voice the language  was atrocious, unfortunately it wasnt about their misbehaving either. This was the start of a long long night, throughout the night people were running along the corridor and shouting and about one in the morning the room above my kids room or thats where it sounded it was coming from, started to play what i can only describe as air hockey, thats just what it sounded like although the lift was next door, with all this going on my children where terrified and my seven year old daughter came into our room through the adjoining door and said she was scared so she then slept the night in bed with my wife and i. As if this was not enough around 1.30 2.00 in the morning there was loud banging on a door which we thought was ours but must have been the next room with a man shouting Janice let me in, let me in, after that we had a very restless night, all five of us. In the morning we went down to breakfast at 08.00 when the place wasn't too busy and there were plenty of free tables so we waited to be placed at a table and after two minutes wait for someone to come we were then seated at a four seater table and told they would bring another place setting which wouldn't  have bothered me but there were six seater tables free all around the place and there we where three of us squashed into one side of the table and two on the other, i was not impressed but i can say the breakfast was nice with a good choice of both hot and cold food. The other thing i have found not only with this hotel but others too and that is the size of their juice glasses, they try and cut down on the amount of pure orange ect that customers drink but it means having to get up and fill the glass three times as i did. Overall we where not overly impressed and would not stay here again. Parking was also charged €6 a night. Oh and the view from our room was over looking waste groung.",2,2016,05,01
249,Family break,"Booked a one-bedroom executive suite, which had a foldout sofa in the living room plus an additional foldout bed for child number 3. Have stayed here multiple times and will continue to do so. Any minor issues are swifly resolved by the incredible staff. Jane, at the reception desk, was a pleasure to deal with.",4,2016,05,01
249,Great stay once you work out the car park. ,"Long weekend competing at a sporting event so we asked for a quiet room. On arrival, reception was manic with a large Irish wedding. But
We were really pleased to be reassured about noise and then upgraded to a fantastic suite in an adjacent block which was exceptionally quiet and well away from the wedding. Thank you so much, it made such a difference. 
Having stayed several times before I was ready for the car parking fee, (it's still the only hotel I've stayed in that you have to pay this as an extra) but because we come and go quite a bit this proves expensive. 
However we discovered on this visit that if you pay up front at the reception, they will give you enough validated cards for your stay at a fixed fee per day instead of feeding the parking meter every time you want out. Much better, but it's taken us 3 visits to find this out! 

Suites fantastic, breakfast superb, bar food great. ",4,2016,05,01
249,Very Good Stay,"First stay at this hotel while on business. Great choice from pleasant check in through to good menu choice in lounge. Room very good but, just missing biscuits and water. Meal in lounge was terrific. Enjoy spicy food and was not disappointed. Will be back. Thank you.",4,2016,04,30
249,great family  hotel,good hotel however price of food very high for what you get. very easy to get to and very near all attractions. room s were spotless. staff very friendly. a bit noisey the first nightand the rooms got very warm however had loads of space for ourselves and three kids,4,2016,04,29
249,Bad stay,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed in this hotel last weekend  and to say the room  was bad is such an under statement it was just hurendus compared to the standard it should have been ,the noise levels on corridors was ridiculous being woken From sleep and all.
, the one good thing was the staff Ashley on reception was so helpful and the rest of the staff  were so friendly and efficient  throughtout the whole evening coco and Anto I believe were  the name's  of the 2  best waiters I've had in a long time, if only the hotel was as nice as the staff it could be something special. ",2,2016,04,28
249,"Lovely pool, great for kids",The family room had good beds and we all loved the pool. The buffet breakfast was also lovely. Staff were very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for a family stay.Near Liffey Valley for some shopping too.,5,2016,04,28
249,Lovely hotel,Had a really good time at this hotel it was relaxing at first but on our last night the noise levels were too much. The staff were really friendly and the breakfast was delicious.. I will return to this hotel ,5,2016,04,27
249,Over priced room,"No water pressure in shower & poor flushing on toilet. The corridor was being decorated so carpet covered in plastic & workmen painting on 3rd floor, room should've been less than 100 euro B&b ! Only stayed for convenience would not return",3,2016,04,27
249,Don't stay by the lift/ elevator.,"Would not stay here again. Paid for a double room and got two single beds pushed together. We stayed in room 330 and it was extremely noisy, could here everyone getting off the lift and the bell every time it stopped on the floor.  My partner and I thought the staff were dry and like robots. 
I must add that the rooms were clean and tidy. The shower and lighting were poor.",2,2016,04,27
249,Great hotel,"Good hotel, good rooms, nice and spacious. Although we didn't spend much time in the hotel as it is out off the way and we spent our time in the centre, there us a number of buses that run directly to the centre. The only downside of the hotel was a group off visitors chanting in the early hours off the morning for a good while, causing lack of sleep. 
",4,2016,04,27
249,Great Hotel,"Great hotel.  Clean and comfortable.  Efficient and lovely staff, great service.  WIFI was the best I've ever experienced at a hotel.  Was not far from a big shopping centre, within walking distance.  Very comfortable bed.  One of the best hotels I've stayed in.  Great value too.",5,2016,04,27
249,Excellent,"This hotel is so child friendly and the staff are very friendly and helpful with the kids. It was a lovely surprise to find a fridge in the room as with 2 kids staying i was dreading the thought of trying to keep milk cool during the night. I usually would have to fill the sink with water to keep the milk cool if the kids woke during the night for a drink of milk. The ourdoor play area was a major plus as the weather was on our side and we were able to enjoy the outdoor play area. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, it was a fantastic and relaxing stay.",5,2016,04,27
249,Amazing,Everything was really perfect..the best hotel in Ireland..the staffs are really friendly and helpful...we really felt comfortable in every way..the Gusto restaurant is incredible their staffs amazing too...,5,2016,04,26
249,Great family friendly hotel,Very pleasant stay. Clean and comfortable room. Great pool. Could not fault this hotel. Staff were helpful and friendly. I would happily stay here again. The room upgrade on arriving was great and we had more space for prams etc.,5,2016,04,26
249,Excellent great value for money,"Have stayed in the Clarion hotel Liffey Valley previously , never disappoints. Clean modern rooms and excellent value for money. Helpful and Friendly staff. 
Top quality room service. 
Comfortable beds. 
",5,2016,04,26
249,Good Hotel,"Value for money.
It's a nice hotel, a lot of fertility to play around with. The packing should be free with booking, €6.00 per night not bad. The  environment and the room are clean. Nice swimming pool 👍.",4,2016,04,26
249,Noisy room,"The stay could have been perfect if the isolation of the room was fine. When we book a hotel like this, we expect some peace and quiet. There was a family next to our room, it was absolutely noisy. To have some rest, it's very difficult in this kind of conditions. It kills all the romance of the room...",3,2016,04,26
249,Family Friendly Hotel,"3rd time staying here. Staff are extremely friendly and I would highly recommend Gusto restaurant. Excellent waiting staff, especially Rachel who very friendly and helpful.
Stayed a Saturday night and there was a lot of noise outside - probably stag party but none of us got much sleep.
",4,2016,04,26
249,Overnight stay,"Family of 5 - 2adults, 3 children aged 16,14 & 12.One night basic room package in the Executive King Room Great spacious 2 bed room apartment with kitchette Very clean and comfortable. Great shower Very happy with everything. ",4,2016,04,26
249,Amazing,Amazing hotel can't wait to stay again rooms where lovely.staff very friendly and food fantastic.plenty to do and shopping centre 10 minutes walk away. Short taxi ride to dublin city centre costing around 20 euro. Airport hopper bus runs every 15 mins to and from hotel.,5,2016,04,25
249,Brilliant,"Despite previous concerns of how far out the hotel was from Dublin city centre, we needn't worry. There was a bus that regularly ran that was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. 
We opted for bed and breakfast and the food was excellent, i thoroughly enjoyed it. 
The bed was massive, could have easily fitted 4 people in. the rooms were lovely and the staff were more than happy to help.
There was also a 'teens room' which offered a pool table, hockey table, wii and xbox.",5,2016,04,24
249,Good location and good customer service,"Stayed two nights. Close to M50 so a good location for business. All staff very friendly from check in to restaurant to room service. Room is standard but had everything needed. On the downside.... Breakfast not great.. sweet++ orange juice, powdery muesli, tinned oranges in the fruit salad. PIzza was pretty good in Gustos restaurant. Chicken wings were covered in some dodgy paste/sauce. On day of checkout, left suitcase in room at reception for collection later in the day. When I returned to pick up at 6pm, the room was full of bags so much that the door was unable to be closed. Bags could easily have been taken by anybody.",3,2016,04,24
249,clean and friendly,"The room was very clean and modern, and overall I had a very comfortable stay.   I was staying in one of the apartments but I felt there were some basic essentials missing from the bathroom though - no tissues, facecloths or body lotion.  In the kitchen, there was only basic tea and coffee available, no herbal teas or mini packets of biscuits were provided.  on a plus side all staff were very friendly.",3,2016,04,24
249,Good if close to your business,"Friendly and competent staff, nice facilities, prompt check-in and check-out. Restaurant's dinner fare looks impressive, but consistently disappoints. As this location serves an industrial park it seems, there were no other restaurants in walking distance.",3,2016,04,24
249,Fantastic,A very well run hotel lovely staff and very helpful plenty to do in hotel with pool gym and the outdoor park very close to liffey valley shopping centre to do bit of shopping overall all we as a family as had a great stay would highly recommend the clarion,5,2016,04,24
249,Off the city centre,"Even with public transport nearby, traffic congestions make it tiresome to come back at the hotel. Also, the swimming-pool is not only for the residents, it's public, so can be crowded.. the two restaurants are a bit dear for the type of food served.",3,2016,04,24
249,Great Business location poor breakfast,"A very disappointing breakfast, cold bacon, many other guests left their bacon in their plates, I did mention this and I was told I was wrong they checked it, a poor response. Coffee weak and orange juice was a poor syrup substitute. 
Recommend staying as hotel is great but buy breakfast elsewhere.",3,2016,04,24
249,Comfort away from home,"Myself and my family have been staying in the clarion on and off for a lot of years now . My girls now bring their friends there when they are going to concerts or shopping.we love it ,the service,the location.and the staff.Thank you for everything .looking forward to our next stay.",4,2016,04,23
249,Clarion hotel lucan,"Good location, clean friendly hotel with good dining services. Good value for money. No breakfast in room facility. Easy access from motorway with nearby shopping centre. Speedy check in and out and very good conference facilities.",4,2016,04,23
249,The best Customer Service I've ever had in a Hotel,I travel alot in my job (which includes training in customer service) This Hotel always exceeds in making me feel like a valued customer. Firstly i was assigned my room by Lucia. She was a joy to deal with. She was efficient and friendly and it was great to see a pleasant face after a long day. There was another lady working on reception (didn't get her name but had blond hair)who also engaged in our conversation. One of the restaurant staff Aafke greeted me at reception also and informed me that if I was dining there tonight that they were very busy and advised booking a table. She went the extra mile and got me a table at very short notice. Sharon dealt with my order and was simply brilliant. She knew I had a long day and very promptly got my order and asked about my day. All staff I dealt with made my day. I want the management to know that they have fantastic staff who always make me welcome. Sometimes people don't say when they experience great service but i feel that the management should be aware of this. Well done to everyone in the Clarion and please share this with your fantastic staff.  Regards Michael Gillespie,5,2016,04,21
249,Good hotel for meetings,"I visited here recently for a meeting.  There is plenty of parking with a large underground carpark.  Everything was very professional and staff were very nice.  The location was good, just on the M50.  Lunch was very nice.",5,2016,04,21
249,"Good location, Good food, Frindly","Easy accessible hotel, easy parking in basement,  very friendly staff in general Two very good restaurants, which  did serve very nice dinner. I in particular liked the Thai restaurant - really good!  breakfast ok - could easy be improved! 
 Rooms clean and good size!",4,2016,04,21
249,Poor nights sleep,"Good hotel with good quality facilities apart from lack of sleep  with children running round the corridors and hallways screaming up to 6am in the morning,had to pay six euro for parking space, children were still in the bar at 11:30, spoke to reception on checkout who said they would pass on my comments to the manager,",1,2016,04,21
249,Good location,"Met friends here for coffee, good location for meeting up convenient for airport and visiting dublin. We didn't stay here but looked clean tidy, good parking available , friends stayed here when visiting Dublin or going to a concert in city",4,2016,04,21
249,Very good but Room to improve...,"We have stayed in Clarion Liffey Valley on 4 occasions now. The general run of the hotel is Excellent But, There are always small things that come to mind.
The Matresses were poor on 3 out of our 4 stays.
There was renovations going on and the smell of paint was overpowering at times.
The Dessert Platter was great one night and poor the next . Expensive too.
No 'Normal Irish ' Food to be had ..Restaurants are great but my Wife is a plain eater and there was no 'Roast Beef' or Lamb etc.....Gusto and Kudos were great to the.
It is a Business hotel but The After Drinks in the Foyer are Not Enjoyable....I'm living in Killarney...Things run a bit different there. Welcome from Staff good but It's like ' They are only saying the words.'', in some cases!!!
Something has to be done with the Parking Cards.
Weekly card for those that are residents....Idea.
Thanks

249,"Great location, great food and great staff",Very good location easy to get to from the South and close to Red Cow Luas for city. Food options very good and service good. Stayed previously and was as good. Some rooms quite far from reception. Good conference and business facilities. Secure car parking available. Was offered a complimentary upgrade on arrival which was nice. ,4,2016,04,20
249,Over priced,"We stayed in the clarion on a family break, 2 adults & 2 children. Hotel is comfortable & clean. However in my opinion it is over priced for what it is. On talking to another family that stayed the same 2 nights as us they had paid considerably less for their room. This is probably main reason for my negative review. In saying that staff could not be faulted. Friendly & accomadation. Next time I think we would stay closer to city centre.",3,2016,04,20
249,Would definitely not recommend,"The service at this hotel is shockingly bad. The hotel may look nice but don't judge a book by its cover. The staff were extremely rude and not pleasant at all. Not to mention the cleaner barely cleaned our room. She made the bed and that's it. She didn't wash any cups and she didn't give us fresh towels which is not what you expect at a 4star hotel. The bed was uncomfortable as you could feel the springs, the teabags and milk weren't topped up after the room had been cleaned as we had to ask for more at reception. Definitely wouldn't waste my money again and I most definitely would not recommend.",1,2016,04,20
249,Well Located,"A bit of A delay getting our rooms but were given complimentary parking to compensate. Stayed in interconnecting family/twin rooms to facilitate 2 families, 2 adults and 4 children in total  A good, clean family friendly hotel conveniently located off M50.",4,2016,04,20
249,Wonderful hotel,"Outstanding hotel, great atmosphere excellent facilities and great location. Always our first choice hotel for Dublin. Handy to get to city centre and close to M50. Exceptionally friendly and great service.",5,2016,04,20
249,We were both unable to sleep,"No thermostat, no fresh air, 
Too loud, M50 was fierce loud
Showers not great, got very hot, then cold
Terrible night sleep
Gym was messy
We both felt it was a poor stay, uncomfortable mainly, but we simply just could not get to sleep",1,2016,04,20
249,Mark mc carthy,"It's a nice hotel , friendly , food is good , breakfast has a great variety and is child friendly . Also very well located . Rooms are priced adequately , the only problem was the queue for breakfast in the morning , waiting nearly 20 mins to be seated and the check in is a bit slow . Other than that food and rooms are good",4,2016,04,20
249,double room,Booked a double room got a twin. Staff tried to sort by joining both beds together only to find then hadn't the right sheets and also that the beds didn't line up.then we ordered food to the room which was dry and tasteless.,1,2016,04,20
249,Very Average,"Family trip- had stayed 3 times previous. Was happy with hotel hence we returned. However hotel rooms need a revamp. For a family of four, they were small. Bathrooms need revamped. Had to ring to reception to sort out noise level on our corridor- was unacceptable. They did so promptly but it should have been dealt with without guests having to complain. Pool was disgusting. We counted about 10 sticky plasters, we even saw chewing gum and it was full of sand. It needed checked thoroughly for these sorts of things. However food was nice in Zgusto restaurant. Bar staff in kudos friendly. ",2,2016,04,19
249,Tired,"Went for a night away for a stop over. Great location, however the noise was awful child couldn't get to sleep and when she did we were awake most of the night with people up and down the hall all night",3,2016,04,19
249,A break away,"Paying for parking,3 night stay was back on room by 4 but room was not made up any day , I left each morning by 9 with a sight on door to make up room its wasn't a big deal , but it would have been nice",4,2016,04,19
249,"Good Location, average amentities","Coffee, coffee, coffee.  It is all about the ease of getting coffee in the morning and on a Sunday morning at 9 am the coffee bar was closed.  not acceptable. not acceptable. I would have the ability to have coffee.",3,2016,04,19
249,great stay and very child friendly,Booked an executive suite which had pull out sofa bed in separate room with kitchen and a very big main bedroom.  Perfect for the kids. Very child friendly hotel. Great location. Nice breakfast. Would stay here again. ,4,2016,04,19
249,Great value,"Would use again. Lids loved the pool. Staff friendly. Food was good. Rooms was what was expected.           
Parking was charged as an extra and we had 2 cars so was 12 euro per night.. was surprised it was not Inc.  ",4,2016,04,18
249,noisiest hotel i was ever in,"Just back from a family night here on Saturday and although yes it's pretty good value remember other people who think it's a great idea to let their kids run up and down the corridors at 10pm while they hit the bar, they find it good value too.
It's ok during the week, I stay often for work but I will never be back on a weekend as this isn't the first time it was bad at the weekend.
It is also worth mentioning they charge you to park your car in their car park,",2,2016,04,18
249,lovely stay,overall a good stay and the beds are comfy and big and food great and staff lovely. the thai food in kudos bar was lovely and full of flavour and the breakfast next morning was great. the sausages were good i must say. overall a great stay. ,4,2016,04,18
249,Short stay in the Clarion,We stayed one night in this hotel and they made or mini-break very enjoyable. We used a family room and our two kids had a great time.  The facilities are excellent and the staff are very friendly. The only criticism was that the availability and space in the pool afforded to hotel guests was restricted. ,5,2016,04,18
249,short break,"Stayed in Clarion in early April for 1 night. Reception was very pleasant and efficient, rooms were clean and modern. Had dinner later that night, good menu with very nice food and excellent service. Lots of youngsters about, but they were well tolerated by staff and not bothersome. A good hotel for tourists, coupes and families located across the road from a large retail park, ideal for shopping trips.",5,2016,04,17
249,outside noise,"Road noise from early morning was terrible, making it impossible to sleep. Outside view from our hotel room was disappointing, an eye sore of a derlict site. Otherwise a lovely room, good quality and comfortable.",3,2016,04,17
249,Poor Reservation system,"Had booked 3 rooms - A single, a twin & a family room. However when booked in, were given a double room instead of the twin room. Only found out when my elderly guests had arrived with their luggage to the incorrect room. Unfortunately, it happened to be a very long walk for them to the wrong room. Reservation staff then insisted they had allocated rooms as per my booking. Once, I produced the e-mail confirmation, they then had us waiting over an hour to prepare a twin room. Front Desk made very little effort to explain or acknowledge their mistake. They appeared to be poorly trained. However, restaurant staff were excellent. Food good so it partially made up for the initial poor welcome.",2,2016,04,17
249,Really friendly helpful staff great hotel!,"I booked this through Wowcher for a 2 night stay.. Was a bit dubious with voucher discount booking and reading some of the reviews ... But I have to say this was one of my better experiences using a discount voucher!! Great communication with staff, all staff were friendly, approachable and extremely helpful :) full of all the typically info tourists ask when visiting somewhere new 😊 room was lovely we arrived early and asked for an early check in there wasn't a room available straight away do we went for a early swim to the spa which was fab! When We came back there was a room available and we were able check in early! Room was spacious clean, warm and tidy! The restaurants are expensive they looked good but we we went out for food and snacks. Parts of the hotel are newer than others we were in the newer block. The hotel is massive! There's a huge shopping centre about a 10 minute walk away with a tonne of shops and cinema the bus stop is about 10-15 minute walk and the a 20 minute ride to Dublin centre. We had a fab stay would definitely go back. ",5,2016,04,17
249,Good value for money,"We received an upgrade to an apartment, very comfortable  double bed, two small beds for children a lovely kitchen area, dining area and a TV in each room.  This would be ideal for a weekend stay with young children.  Looking forward to next trip.  
",5,2016,04,17
249,"""Great stay""",We had an amazing time.Rooms were clean and the staff are really helpful and kind.We had a very good breakfast.Pool was great and we had lots of fun.Definetily coming back.Food was very nice and lots of space for the kids to play,5,2016,04,17
249,Not happy,"Requested for an early Check in at 1300 however upon arrival from a different city we were informed that room will be ready at 1500 so waited for 2 hours for check in
Service at breakfast on both days was horrible as nobody came to ask for tea or coffee 
Nobody came to clear the table,say greetings,asked for a fried egg two times and than we received fried egg.staff was there on the floor but it seemed that they were not allotted any stations or tables.management was not at all visible at breakfast hours.hostess or manager was only standing at the reception desk and was not at all interacting with the guests.
Had ginger salmon in kudos on lunch and it was watery and not well cooked.",3,2016,04,17
249,Overnight stay ,"We stayed here one night after a week of traveling thru Ireland. The staff was helpful. Particularly one women that pretty much handled everything it seemed like at the hotel. She helped us check in, answered the phones, exchanged money, and helped other folks. And she did this without making you feel neglected. She helped us on information for the shuttle that picks you up from the lobby and drops you off at the airport. Definitely would stay here again. ",5,2016,04,17
249,3rd stay at Clarion hotel,"Good location for me, all the facilities one needs, nice breakfast,plenty of parking,20 min`s to Dublin city center, good access to roads etc, comfy beds, i have no complaints about this hotel, back in a months time.",4,2016,04,17
249,excellent  hotel,"Aftee 17 hrs driving this is the hitel you want to stay. It has a Comfy bed, good hotel facilities, Italian restaurant do tasty food. Pool,  jacuzzi , steam room are excellent.  Only 30 mins to port in rush hours, 20 mins without traffic. ",5,2016,04,17
249,Lovely stay,We received a complimentary upgrade to a suite what a shame we were only therefor a quick overnight stay ! All staff are very friendly. The pizza we had was delicious . Will return as location for us is ideal,5,2016,04,16
249,Very good apart from location of family rooms,"Had a nice stay apart from the location of the room, we had two kids staying with us,all was fine till 7am the next morning,when doors started slamming outside our room, meaning our kids were woken up. The family room was located beside a busy part of the hallway, right beside lifts and doors and stairwells, so the was a lot of foot traffic and noise right beside our room..... 302,but apart from that the hotel met our requirements",4,2016,04,16
249,Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,"Nice hotel. Shouldn't have to pay for parking as a hotel guest. Rooms are lovely, very clean. Bar very dingy and dirty tables at 11pm at night with 3 working behind bar and 8 people drinking. Great variety at breakfast and actually got great hot coffee. 
 
",3,2016,04,16
249,Mrs P Mckenna,"Excellent hotel with excellent service well recommended hotel. Had a fantastic weekend, rooms are very clean. Staff are extremely friendly. Will definitely be back to visit and will stay in the Clarion hotel. ",5,2016,04,14
249,Enjoyable stay,We are a family of 6 so not many hotels in Dublin cater for me family this size. The rooms and lay out was perfect for us and breakfast was lovely.Definately recommend it. Only thing was that the pool didn't open till 9am which was a bit late when you hav a young family up early.,4,2016,04,13
249,Very good,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here in april 2016, its an excellent hotel the staff are so friendly and will do anything for you if they can. Check in wasnt untill 1500 and we arrived from the airport at 10.00am we were still able to check in as the room was ready. When we walked down the corridors we saw they were painting and had plastic covers on the carpet. A few hours later the manager called our room and asked if we wanted to change rooms due to this we declined though. It was curtious and professional of them to ask and i appriciated that. It was very cold in the room especially in the evenibgs so i asked for a heater and they brought it to the room free of charge. I came in one morning at 3am and the made me a chicken sandwich for 6€ it was the best thing i tasted! We didnt eat in the hotel resturant but we ate at the arc bar which at lunch time is like a buffet service and evenings it turns into a set resturant menu and bar/club at night time. Its a 10/15 min walk to the bridge to the nearest bus stop to get the bus into town which is the cheapest option. 9€ for a shuttke bus to the airport one way. We also used the spa facilities; swimming pool, sauna, hot tub and steam room which were great and very clean, swimming pool a little small though. Its 3€ to purchase a compulsory swimming hat they wont let you in without one. Also liffey valley shopping centre is a 10 min walk up the road with a good variety of shops.
Overall this hotel has excellent staff, average location to central dublin. Room cleaniliness is great except a stray hair underneath the toilet seat! We had a great stay. ",4,2016,04,13
249,Great Hotel,"I enjoyed staying at this Hotel. The staff are very friendly, professional, helpful and knowledgeable. Even the partner company hopper service was able to accommodate us early :) . I plan on going here again in the near future !!! And recommend to any one interested in coming to dublin. Just be careful late at night on the  street ",5,2016,04,13
249,appointment for Hermitage Hosp,"did not like room given on the below ground level,  very dark and cold and drab.
we had breakfast next morning at 13 euros each (26 euros) for scrambled egg and toast. bad value.
meal in the Kudos restaurant excellent and pleasant.",3,2016,04,13
249,Comfortable hotel for work crowd,"The hotel is decent, decor looks modern but has an overall aged feeling. The majority of guests looked like businessmen.

Positives:
> Spacious room
> Comfy beds and fluffy pillows
> Ironing board, hair dryer, kettle and fridge in the room
> windows can be opened
> Good bathroom with bath
> Easy access to airport by m50
> Well equipped friendly gym (they provide a towel at the gym), sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and swimming pool
> A small kids play area and kids club
> An Asian and an Italian restaurant on site. Tried the Asian for dinner, the satay sauce is superb and the service was very friendly at the bar. Lunch at Kudos was packed but service was very fast, efficient, friendly and servings for lunch were generous. 
> Free WiFi and fairly good speeds
> Parking is available on site and the staff can let you out for free for short trips.

To Improve:
> no airconditioning but a fan is provided.
> the rooms were too warm at night even without the heating on. So window had to be kept open to cool the room down.  But when you open the window it can be noisy from the vehicles from M50. It didn't interrupt my sleep though. My partner found it hard.
> Breakfast had all the options but we didn't like it. The fried breakfast was poor quality. The best item was the hash brown and I would rate it 3 out of 5. I wish that is improved.  
> Breakfast seemed to be understaffed and slightly disorganised. We had to wait for a staff to pass by to request coffee and that was not just us.

Note: the way down to parking can be narrow for a wide car, so be careful. 

In short, this hotel rates 3 for me. For a work visit, I would not hesitate to come back here again. 

",3,2016,04,13
249,Pleasant Stay,"Liked the atmosphere here - pleasant staff, warm welcome, decent leisure facilities, lovely spacious room, good bed. Enjoyed excellent meal in the Asian restaurant. Breakfast fine and varied. Feels like a really well run hotel with excellent staff. We needed to park so great out of City location if you are exploring.",5,2016,04,13
249,Last minute wonder,We initially had booked in another hotel for my son's birthday but after one night it was so unpleasant we had to leave. The Clarion was fortunately in a position to accommodate us and was helpful from the start. Making my sons birthday a great experience which included cake and candles and staff singing. Thank u!,5,2016,04,13
249,such slow service,the service in the restaurant at dinner and breakfast was the worst i've ever experienced. the dinner took nearly hour and half to serve and i ordered a bottle of wine with dinner at 840 and after asking twice i eventuality got it at 9.20,2,2016,04,12
249,Short stay just outside Dublin.,My wife and I had a great short break on the outskirts of Dublin. After a disappointing start (The previous occupants had stunk out the room smoking) some very helpful and apologetic staff ensured we had a great stay! ,4,2016,04,12
249,Weekend break,"This was our fourth time to stay at Clarion Liffey Valley, great value, clean, convenient to shops, cinema and city. Friendly and helpful staff, relaxed atmosphere, our kids love it especially the pool.",4,2016,04,12
249,Gerard Daly.,"Had a wonderful stay, very comfortable, service great, food excellent would highly recommend. Close to all amenities and just a short bus journey to city center with a regular service.Staff were on hand to assist in any way and to advise on the easiest way to get around.

",5,2016,04,12
249,Niki,"Good, clean hotel with a nice welcome .... didn't sleep well room a bit cold. Otherwise had a great stay.... Wifi was great. Layout of room good. Dining in room- lovely food and friendly service. Thank you ",4,2016,04,12
249,training course,be wary of interconnecting bedrooms as noise carries through very easily. and you are dependent upon other guests respecting other people's privacy and comfort.  even noise from tvs carries very easily through interconnecting doors.,3,2016,04,12
249,Clarion hotel Liffey valley,Busy hotel with nice pool for children to play in. Breakfasts are good between 7 and 11 am and the Italian restaurant serves lovely food. Bedrooms comfortable with all facilities on site and close to large shopping centre,5,2016,04,12
249,great Hotel for a Family Break,"Excellent hotel for a family break, plenty of facilities for younger children and for teenagers.  The dining was very good and great value.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  A relaxed and enjoyable experience.  I will return again soon.",5,2016,04,12
249,Overnight shopping trip,"Comfortable bed
Friendly staff
Close to Liffey valley shopping centre
20 mins drive from dundrum shopping centre
We stay here anytime we are in Dublin
Great for family's too 
Family rooms are spacious.
Staff are helpful. We had booked an adjoining room before but staff had made a blunder so we were given the penthouse suite as an apology. Fantastic suite. ",5,2016,04,12
249,last day in Dublin,"Nice hotel, good price, convenient  to airport and city center  . WiFi was  weak. Secure, staff was friendly.  Did not use restaurants  or bar but seemed well presented. Would not hesitate to select again.",4,2016,04,11
249,"Dublin, without the noise.","Friendly staff, good food and nice room. Loved how easy it was to get in and out of Dublin city without too much fuss and I noticed the really handy airport transport that picks up right outside the front door. 
Only complaint was that the breakfast service needs some serious work as despite the fact that the lad to seated us asked if we wanted tea or coffee, we still had to go bother a passing server for our morning caffeine.  But the staff in the dining room were really lovely and did try their best.",4,2016,04,11
249,"very good hotel, good value for money,","Excellent value for money with all good facilities, modern rooms, and very good service.
The bedroom was clean, and large with a queen sized double, good ensuite, and we had a suite with a separate seating area by the window; also used the restaurant across from the hotel called the Arc, excellent service and food.",4,2016,04,10
249,gustos restaurant in hotel,"visited this restaurant last night with another couple. food was beautiful, nice atmosphere. would come again for sure. only thing i will say is that perhaps the music could be changed to some soft background music, with it being evening time, as the music was very ""thump"" ""thump"" and got in the way of conversation. but apart from this it was lovely.",4,2016,04,10
249,Wish I was staying longer,Was up in Dublin for the day and myself and my partner decided to stay the night as he has an early flight in the morning. The room is lovely and spotlessly clean. Its also not to hot or too cold in the room. The kiddies play area down the hall is a great little feature for anyone with small children and the vending machines are far too tempting and handy as you can use your debit card on them. Wish I was staying more than just the night so I could explore the place more.,4,2016,04,09
249,Not bad to stay overnight. Not more.,"Actually this is the place where usually staying overnight groups of old people from Europe and China travelling around the Europe and staying each night in another place. Besides, families with small kids looking for cheap hotels and techs from all around the world, supporting local high tech companies.
The neighborhood is very problematic. First - pubs being a source of overnight noise. If your windows orienting toward parking lot - you'll feel it. No slip.
There isn't an optimistic picture if your windows from another side - during the night you'll wake-up due to long tracks horns.
Second - Hotel's pool, sauna and gym are not belong to hotel - they are for about 2000 local citizens, and between them very specific persons. So if you'll leave your belonging unattended there's a good chance they would be ""lost"". This is my personal experience.
The rooms interior is very Spartan, nothing special, nothing new.
Conclusion - if you're short of money, or loving pubs atmosphere with its noise etc - pick this hotel.
If you like traditional hotels - avoid.",3,2016,04,09
249,Taking care of you,"Once again I am delighted to have chosen to stay with the staff of this fine hotel. Arriving late on a Thursday night I was made feel at home. A weary traveller was made feel welcome and given the chance to relax. Excellent check in, comfortable quiet elegant rooms in a location ideal for both the city and airport, a perfect place. ",5,2016,04,08
249,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, upon arrival we were given a free room upgrade which was more of a suite. The room was lovely and very large with a superking bed.
Breakfast was ok but the scrambled eggs were a bit bland and could not believe that they did not do mushrooms. We only had breakfast here the once because the queue was so long. Having said all that we would stay again as the actual hotel is very good.",4,2016,04,08
249,Sound proofing ,"Rooms backing on to the dual way, have very inadequate sound proofing. Noise incessant, unless very sound sleeper, sleep will be nigh on impossible. Staff are very pleasant and helpful.  When polite complaint was made requesting that lost night be replaced, unsatisfactory response. Rooms just across the corridor perfectly restful, so if you stay make sure you request a quiet one. My business would not go there again. ",2,2016,04,08
249,Normally very good but disappointed this time,"I have stayed here several times now and previous stays have been very good all round. Unfortunately on this occasion I had issues with noise outside my room (202 near reception), a blocked bathroom sink and poor wifi speed. I was also made to feel in the wrong when I questioned the flavour of my ice cream dessert (asked for vanilla but was given pistachio), then had to watch a staff debate over my dessert held in clear view within the restaurant. ",3,2016,04,08
249,Very nice family friendly hotel,"Stayed here a few times with the kids for a family break. Nice place to stay - clean, staff are friendly, child friendly. Great swimming pool facilities. There is a shallow pool suitable for younger children.
Only negative thing to say is you have to pay for parking.",4,2016,04,06
249,Just ok,"We decided to stay at the Clarion for our wedding anniversary.  We had an early morning flight in, where we had hours to wait for check in, we were kindly checked in nearly two hours early.  We paid for breakfast whilst we were waiting for our room: it certainly wasn't worth the money; the service was good in the restraurant, the food was luke warm  and like school dinners, I've certainly had a lot better, we never went back during our stay.  The room was spacious and clean.  I probably won't go back to the Clarion as it was quite a way out of the city, taxis were €20/25 one way, however there are buses but they stop at 11.30pm: for those with mobility problems there is a bit of a walk to bus stop. The service in the hotel was good. ",3,2016,04,06
249,Family stay,"Excellent hotel. Brought my 2 young girls for their first hotel stay & they loved it. All the staff were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. The rooms were lovely, very clean. The pool and gym facilities were excellent.",5,2016,04,06
249,Room was great size,Room was very comfortable and great to have 2 room suite . Space was brilliant especially since my children are quite young. My children certainly enjoyed the hotel . A child lock on bathroom would be handy as we had a few incidents with one year old but I know it probably not possible.  One thing which did bug me was having to pay for carparking even though we were paying guests of the hotel.  It was a little too much.  - everything else was great ,4,2016,04,04
249,Exceptional Service and Pool Facilities,"I have just arrived back from a 1 night stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley with my 2 sons and was very impressed by the pool and changing areas which were spotless. The family room (free wifi) was very clean and the hotel staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Nice selection in the asian style restaurant in the evening. Breakfast was delicious in the Kudos restaurant. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, great location for a short break next to restaurants, cinema and shopping.",5,2016,04,04
249,Not good at all,"They never got it right. 

I never had such a bad customer service from hotel.

They did not have a room that we had booked available and tried to ""upgrade"" us to other building - first floor and first door to entrance. Because of them our check-in took like 45minutes.

Rooms were clean but walls were paper thin. Breakfast was just Irish breakfast nothing healthy basically.

Do not even want to write about the gym staff and their service.

Never had this bad experience within hotels anywhere.

Our weekend getaway really suffered due to the hotel.

This is quite far from the city and you have to pay for parking.",1,2016,04,03
249,Family Easter break,"A brilliant, relaxing family hotel with welcoming, friendly and efficient staff.  Bedrooms and facilities are clean, fresh and comfortable - family rooms well sized. Lovely food with great choices for adults and children alike served at breakfast and evening meals we had. A special thank you to Rachel for so kindly looking out for our younger son! Much appreciated :-). Our boys enjoyed the pool facilities and although we didn't avail of the kids club, the entertainment certainly seemed impressive! Hotel is easily accessible and ideally situated for Tayto Park, Dublin Zoo and other city attractions - all just a short journey away. We will certainly return and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - great value for money. ",5,2016,04,03
249,Family break,"Besides been very busy at breakfast times, this is an excellent hotel, we stayed in an executive King suite and its was well equipped for our needs, 2 adults and 3 kids. Both rooms were spotless clean as was the bathroom. Excellent wifi speeds were also available in our room. Along with a good choice of TV channels which is a must when travelling with kids :) We've stayed in this hotel on a few occasions now as its ideally situated in Dublin, very close to Liffey valley shopping centre, along with a retail park on Fonthill. Also it's only 20 mins drive to the nearby Tayto park. ",5,2016,04,03
249,Mrs mcnulty,This hotel is excellent value for money. It's overall appearance is not lavish and it has been well used from we stayed there last but everything about it is good. We had two rooms and although the family room was a bit cramped with everyone in it we all had a comfy bed each. The breakfast was excellent. There were lengthy queues and the restaurant worked extremely hard to clear tables and get everyone seated. The staff were very friendly and nothing was a bother. The food was tasty and plentiful. The main pool is mainly for adults as it is too deep for children and the children's pool is too small for older children. That is probably the only complaint I could make about this place. Overall this is an excellent hotel in terms of value for money and it's just a pity it's location wasn't more exciting!!,4,2016,04,03
249,Could've been better,"I probably would rare the hotel good if it would let me as it was better than average. The good points: very easy to find, ideal location, good shopping close by, spotlessly clean. The things that could be improved upon, no air conditioning in bedrooms, car parking charges a bit steep. Based on our own experience I found check in very rushed even though it wasn't that busy. We weren't told anything about the leisure facilities or even where they were. No local information given. Luckily I had done some research before we left so had some idea. A bit of time during check in would have made all the difference. We ate in Gustos one evening and it was excellent. A special shout out to our server Sharon, made the evening for us. We found out more about the hotel from Sharon than we did from Reception staff. The location and cost made this a very pleasant stay and we would go back but a few small touches would make it an excellent hotel and very hard to pass by.",3,2016,04,03
249,Excellent hotel with A1 facilities,"Liffey valley is kind of on the outskirts of dublin meaning the hotel is in the suburbs. On first sighting you think car dealerships and a dodgy housing estate what have i done! However one you enter the hotel and see its excellent facilities, friendly staff and cleanliness you realise thd hotel is in a wee world of class on its own. Pool fantastic great for kids and adults who want to swim and not just lie up! Clean and tidy staff excellent. Just watch the showers though they havent been plumbed with their own cold water feed so if someone runs sink or flushes toilets you could get burnt v easily! ",5,2016,04,02
249,Great place.,"Stayed here for one night whilst over in ireland for work. This is the third time I've stopped in this hotel although not been here for a few years. They've updated the resturant. The room was great, I had three beds (two single, one double) just for me. I can't fault the hotel at all. The place is excellent. The location was great for where we needed to be the next day. Its also like 20 mins from Dublin city centre. The rooms are imaculate. Breakfast the next day was buffett and i love the Irish breakfasts. There was a great variety of hot and cold food. I ate both. My only grip and this is with every hotel that does this kind of stuff, is everything is so high up. I'm disabled and can never get anything I want. Thankfully i had work collegaues with me, however sometimes i like doing my own stuff. So i would recommend lowering some items. But like I said, its an issue with all hotels. Throughly enjoyable stay.",4,2016,04,02
249,Nice hotel..,"Check in was fast and easy friendly receptionist, room was spacious and beds were very comfortable, tv was great with lots of channels, clean room, and delicious breakfast with a wide variety, there was very helpful friendly staff at breakfast. Great location to shops and shopping centre, easily accessible. Only downsides was that the rooms don't seem to be very sound proof as could clearly hear noise from other rooms and hallway and this affected our quality of sleep, shower didn't seem to work well and water leaked onto floor and hairdryer did not work. Parking was €6 for guests and I thought this was a bit ridiculous. Apart from this I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would definetly go back",4,2016,04,02
249,over night family stay,Highly recommended - stayed in apartments which were ideal as we still availed of breakfast and evening meal and my young kids thoroughly enjoyed the pool and kids club. Relaxing break and will be back,5,2016,04,02
249,Great family break,"This was our third stay at the Clarion in Liffey Valley, we stay here because of its location to the shopping centre and cinema and also they do family activity packages where you get zoo or tayto park tickets. Great stay although slightly more expensive that usual.",4,2016,04,02
249,"Nice hotel, poor customer service.","We spent three nights here with our three children after staying at the hotel previously about 4 years ago. We booked a family room over the phone in January & discussed the room with the chap that took the booking ensuring it was the same as the type of family room we had for our last stay (3 beds & a separate living / kitchenette space). We had also asked for a cot for our youngest child. When we arrived our family room was one room with three beds & no cot. When the cot arrived it wouldn't fit in as the room was too small. We contacted reception & complained that this was not the room type we had booked etc but the lady at reception dismissed us saying we had a family room & there was nothing she could do now. Apparently it was an executive room we thought we were getting & if we wanted one it would be an extra €65 per night. The level of customer service was very bad on this occasion. We were told we would need to wait half an hour for some staff member to help us with a luggage trolley. Furthermore after we settled in (to the room we didn't book) (with no cot) we went to the bar to eat. Every table was full so we said we would sit in the lobby & eat. We were told we had to pay for our food in advance if we were choosing to sit in the lobby! Policy apparently! Never mind that the actual bar was full & we had no option but to eat in the lobby. The bar was understaffed & we were made feel like we were causing hassle by ordering food!  They charge customers €6 per night to park in the hotel car park. Ridiculous! The first three hours of parking is free (so people who visit the hotel for a quick lunch or a meeting don't need to pay) but good paying overnight customers have to pay??? Overall we found the level of customer service very poor & unsatisfactory, with no hint of valuing a customer. Aside from that the food was nice, breakfast good, clean, warm etc but based in customer service we wouldn't be inclined to stay with our family again. ",4,2016,04,01
249,Easter weekend Family Break,"it was a Lovely hotel, very family friendly with a lovely pool, food was great,A  very pleasant stay, would highly recommend going on a family break there.will definitely be going back again in the near future",5,2016,04,01
249,"Handy, pleasant and great value for money","My husband, my two girls and myself are just back from a very pleasant stay at the Clarion. We got there on Wednesday 30th March from Belfast and found it easy to get to and close enough to Dublin City Centre.

The girls at Reception were lovely and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and the beds really comfy. The Bathroom is ok too. All very nice and clean. We really enjoyed the swimming pool and leisure facilities. We brought our own hats, which saved us a few euros.

We didn't use the Gusto Restaurant. But the Kudos bar had really good atmosphere and was great for food. First night better than the second. Obviously a different chef on the Thursday night, nowhere near as good as the Wednesday night. Big thank you to Anto, the loveliest waiter ever! Such credit to the hotel. Friendly and efficient. Please, pass on my praise.

Also the very informative Sheila from reception, who gave us the perfect directions to the nearest bus stop to Phoenix Park.

Breakfast was excellent. We went down at 8am, which is the best time, as an hour later there was a big queue of guests trying to get a table.

On the downside though, the €6 carpark fee per night and the vacuum cleaner lying in the middle of the bedrooms corridor the whole time we were there.

Overall I will highly recommend the Clarion for a family break and we would definitely be back with no hesitation. ",4,2016,04,01
249,Excellent stay,"Midweek break for myself, wife and 9 year old son.
Check in was nice and easy.
Room was great, the usual amenities.
Very clean plenty of room for the three of us.
TV had loads of channels.
Room was cleaned each day with new sheets and towels.

Swimming Pool was very nice (need more signs to it though)
1.4m deep and 10m long. Nice and warm which made a nice change from most hotel pools. Shallow pool for the kiddies.
Towels from the reception, nice changing rooms.
The down side was they take the float out of the pool at 5pm for some reason, kids still playing with them.

We ate each night in the hotel, twice in Kudos (Asian) and once in Gusto (Italian)
Both were excellent.
I had nasi goreng lemon tart for dessert and my wife had a fish cakes prawn dish.
Ask for the movie deal which we did. We got two tickets for Vue (cinema in LIffey Valley) as part of the deal.
Gusto was really good as well, I had spag bol, wife had a salmon dish.
The highlight of the whole stay was when our lad asked the pizza chef could he watch him. The chef brought him into the pizza station and actually let Jamie make his own pizza, the base, toppings the lot. He was so delighted and the pizza was lovely when he finished it.
What a fantastic thing for the chef to do, what a great bloke.

Breakfast was the usual fare, plenty of it and was all lovely.
Please get another toast machine, big que for it each morning.
Staff were great, some of the best I've come across, couldn't be more helpful.
Close enough to public transport a 10 minutes walk to the bus to the city centre.
Kids club in the evening which cost €5 for 2 hours and Jamie loved it.

Be visiting again, really great stay",5,2016,04,01
249,Very family friendly,"Very clean, spacious and friendly hotel. All staff were very helpful at all times. A very child friendly/family hotel with reasonable onsite restaurants. Hotel pool good with excellent changing facilities. ",4,2016,04,01
249,Noise,"If you are going to stay here the only problem was the noise at night so you may want to ask for
a 2nd or 3rd floor room. Also if you hear a buzzing noise at night it's the fridge we turned ours off as it was pretty loud. I also would recommend you try to get down to breakfast early and try to stay away from the restraunt that is 5 mins out the doors of the hotel.",4,2016,04,01
249,Rooms to hot,"Booked through booking.com & nothing we requested was as it should have been! It therefore ended up costing us €56 more than expected! Not the hotel fault! Hotel clean, good service for dinner, food fantastic! Rooms too hot!! ",3,2016,04,01
249,Family Night Stay,"Excellent hotel in terms of cost, facilities, location, friendliness and being family friendly. However the biggest disappointment to this is the rooms are not sound proof, as the noise from the room next to ours and from the corridor kept us awake most of the night and I would be classed as a deep sleeper. ",4,2016,04,01
249,Consistent Excellence,"I picked this hotel for its facilities and its location for Shopping and its facilities , pool and gym. I have been here before and will be back again its service and rooms are top quality. Breakfast is fab and fully stocked with lots of choice. 
This hotel is not a centrally located hotel in the city of Dublin, If you have a car however the city centre is very  accessible and worth the stay. ",5,2016,04,01
249,Good for familes,"I stayed here for two nights with my wife and three of the children. We had a family room with a travel cot added and it was as comfortable as these trips tend to be.

We made great use of their pool and with the Liffey Valley shopping centre right next door, had plently of options for entertainment and food. We went to the cinema and eddie rockets one evening, and the following day drove in to Phoenix Park and Dublin Zoo, which is all very convenient to the hotel.",4,2016,03,31
249,Disappointing. Misleading as 4 star hotel,"Staff weren't informed about our booking initially. This made our check in slow. Toilet had stains inside the bowl but otherwise the room was clean and comfortable. A double room was booked but we recieved a twin room. The hairdryer was in the wardrobe wired into the wall. The hairdryer couldnt be moved to be used at the dressing table. No facilities such a trouser press. Only one elevator near reception was working the night we arrived, these were very sluggish when working.  The 4star rating is very misleading.",2,2016,03,31
249,Amazing stay ,"We visited this hotel for bday of my friend, nice rooms , big beds , great service , good location , great spa, friendly staff, very nice breakfast , will recommended to everyone , easy to get there from airport with they'd transport or busses , close to it big shopping centrum , couldn't wish better Easter ,thank you ",5,2016,03,31
249,Great location for a family weekend/short break,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 days with 2 other family's. The hotel was chosen for its location to Tatyo park and ,the near by shopping center. There was some initial problems on the first day,rooms were not available until 6 o clock which was totally unacceptable and at check in, incorrect rates were been applied by the hotel from the agreed price. We sought the manager and he quickly agreed that the hotel was at fault at not up to there standards and apologized on both counts. This aside the hotel is a busy hotel during the day but caters well for family and staff are extremely friendly and helpful.
The pool is busy ,very clean and has a kiddies pool/sauna/steam room,keeps the kids /mammy daddy happy.
Food-Breakfast time like any busy hotel gets very busy after 930.Buffet layout fresh and more than adequate.
We dined in both restaurants both well priced and very tasty,the pizzas especially are delicious.
Location wise Liffey Valley shopping center is a short walk and a 20 min drive to Tatyo Park.
We stayed in adjoining family rooms in the hotel,very clean and well laid out the suite option is also available on the grounds.",4,2016,03,31
249,sufficient,"as before, no adult only areas; there were children everywhere; felt like we were in a holiday camp;and dinner menus and times were not very explicit. the staff were very friendly and helpful; especially Marina ( ? ) pool area was very good.",3,2016,03,31
249,Happy Valley,"We had a really enjoyable stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley.  Ours was a family break for the Dublin Easter Rising commemorations and our party included Nana & Grandad - who are not so fit these days.  The hotel staff were brilliant in arranging for us to have adjacent rooms with a connecting door so we could all keep an eye on one another.  Our rooms were very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed.  Our family room had plenty of room for Mum & Dad plus 2 teenagers and the superior twin room had ample space with a bistro table and chairs - and a balcony.  They were a little warm (one of the rooms did not have a radiator) and we had to open windows to adjust the temperature - air-conditioning would have been useful.  We used the pool and both restaurants during our stay and all were excellent.  The location of the hotel was very good.  It always seemed to be about 20 minutes from everywhere we needed to to go - the airport, Dublin City and the Wicklow Mountains.  Most importantly, every one of the staff from the front desk to the cleaners were always friendly and very helpful during what would have been an extremely busy time for the Hotel - so thanks to them and Well Done !",5,2016,03,31
249,Pleasant stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights over Easter weekend.  The hotel is generally quite pleasant and clean with friendly and warm reception staff.  The room we had was very clean and well equipped with what you'd expect: tv, tea and coffee facilities,  towels, hair dryer, iron etc.  The room was cleaned and tidied every morning whilst we were out.  We didn't eat at the hotel as the menu seemed very continental and expensive so ate out and got some good proper pub grub in Dublin. Not too far from the City Centre - about a 20 minute drive.  May consider staying here again on our next trip to Dublin.  The only downside of the stay was every evening the corridors seemed to be awash with noisy children running about everywhere.  It seems the families that stay let their kids of the leash and let them do what they want. It's not the kind of behavior you'd expect to see at an establishment of this kind. Disappointing. Other than that, a pleasant stay.",4,2016,03,30
249,Never disappoints,Stay here quite regularly as the hotel is family friendly and Liffey Valley shopping centre is just around the corner- happy days! Must mention the Asian restaurant in the Kudos bar area- the food here is excellent and the staff so efficient especially Coco,4,2016,03,30
249,Bank holiday weekend,"Good location, very easy access by bus or car to the city centre. Teenagers loved the close access to the Liffey valley shopping centre. Great for larger families.  We stayed in the executive suite as we have 3 older children so they had own room with sofa bed and camp bed. Plus we had a small kitchenette with a fridge, microwave and toaster and a table and chairs. We were very impressed with the Italian restaurant, very authentic.  ",4,2016,03,30
249,Nice place to stay,"We were a group of friends and shared a family room (basically a four bed room). 
Everything was cozy and clean and we really enjoyed our stay. 
They provide tea and coffee in the rooms which is nice.
The service staff is nice as well. We didn't use the room service though. 

Actually it was nicer than i expected in that price range. :) 

They have a pretty affordable hotel bar, prices are even a little cheaper than most places we've been to in the city centre. 

The surrounding isn't quite exciting, maybe except for the massive shopping centre nearby. 
But you get into the centre of Dublin in a 20 minute Bus ride, wich costs 2,70€ per way. 

All in all we enjoyed staying there (: 

",4,2016,03,29
249,Bar staff and hotel,Bar staff were quite ignorant and abrupt. The hotel had become run done chipped tiles in bathroom and cleanliness of room. Food has become very dear in hotel so we would ate in surrounding restaurants which are a higher quality and a lot cheaper and friendlier.,3,2016,03,29
249,Best Hotel Ever,Definitely recommend staying here. Everything about hotel is fantastic. From checking in to checking out. Rooms very clean. Food is excellent. Stay very friendly and very helpful. Especially martina. Pool facilities also excellent ,5,2016,03,29
249,Fantastic trip,"Fab location
Great staff who couldn't do enough for you.
Good size pool for the family.
Ideal location next to shopping centre and close to town centre.
Will Def be back.
Great range of kids facilities and clubs which we did not avail off however will Def try out next time!",5,2016,03,29
249,Family surprise stay,"We returned to the Clarion Liffey Valley once again as a family treat. We always enjoy staying at the hotel, it's lively with a lovely atmosphere. Kudos serves great food & we were highly impressed with your Italian restaurant on this visit.",4,2016,03,28
249,Excellent staff and value for money,First time to stay here and we were very impressed. We had a family room it was very comfortable. The hotel is very clean and plenty for small kids to do. All staff were friendly and helpful. Food in kudos was good and breakfast was also good.  The service in the bar was quick and friendly. We have only good things to say about this hotel and look forward to coming back ,5,2016,03,28
249,Average,"Booked 4 nights in March through the HRS booking site.  Reception and lobby impressive but not so lavish when you pass through the doors heading for your room.  Room was a good size with very large bed and all expected facilities.  Our problem was there was brown stains on the base of the toilet. when we were on our way out I informed reception and was told it would be deal with it. We arrived back late evening and the problem was still there.  I complained again and a cleaner was sent to the room but she said there was nothing she could do about it.  I spoke to the duty manager who agreed it was unacceptable, apologised but said the hotel was full and he could do nothing until the next day when, if maintenance could not repair the toilet he would find us another room.  Despite complaining nothing was done and the problem was ignored. On check out the receptionist apologised saying it should have been dealt with and offered a free upgrade next visit and agave us a discount.  Too little too late as our stay was over and although I appreciate the discount if I wanted a cheap stay with dirty toilets I would have booked a hostel.",2,2016,03,28
249,Lovely for families,"Stayed 2 nights using the zoo package & the kids loved it. Very friendly staff & good size room. The kids swimming pool was lovely the only thing I found fault with were young lads walking in and out of the women's changing rooms, I thought they were a bit too old to be using the women's rooms. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay & will return.",4,2016,03,28
249,Great Family Hotel,"I have 4 kids and this hotel is great. It's easy to get to and right beside Liffey Valley. Very welcoming to kids, rooms are spacious, beds are very comfortable.  Breakfast buffet is very good. It can be very busy at breakfast time but we've stayed here many times so we don't mind this. They do movie nights for kids most nights also and have a games room for older kids. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone with kids. ",4,2016,03,27
249,Family Stay at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,"We were looking for a mid-week deal to visit Dublin and the Clarion at Liffey Valley ticked the boxes.
We had a great stay with our 3 children.
The pool is a pre-requisite when staying in a hotel for us and it was prefect with a sauna and steam room as an extra bonus.
The location is prefect, just off the M50 and beside the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which has a cinema.
The room, staff and food were everything we would have expected and we would definitely recommend it to travelling families.",5,2016,03,27
249,Mr,Very good and clean hotel and would recommend this hotel to anybody! Great relaxed atmosphere at this hotel and will not hesitate to book this hotel again! Breakfast was first class in terms of food and service!,4,2016,03,27
249,Great Hotel!,"Stayed here for 3 nights - lovely reception area, very well appointed room, extremely comfy bed/bedding, great bathroom and smashing food - Kudos Asian Restaurant very good and brekkie fantastic too - recommended.",5,2016,03,27
249,Very good hotel!,"Very child friendly hotel! Nice food, loads of variety! The only thing i on't like is the rooms, there is no control for room temperature. It gets hot at times. I know there is a fan supplied but I don't like using fans specially if there's an infant in the room. Overall, we had a wonderful time.",4,2016,03,26
249,Treat for ourselves,We were delighted with the staff who were friendly and courteous. The room was clean and suited our needs. The pool was well maintained and the boys enjoyed the swim epecially. I would happily stay there again when visiting Dublin. Thanks!,5,2016,03,26
249,Traveler with my mother and 2 young kids,Brilliant hotel!! if you have kids with you. Great for shopping too and we drove in to city in 15 minutes totally loved this hotel and would highly recommend it. Lovely staff. Breakfast was so good. Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. ,5,2016,03,26
249,Our stay,"Pros: good price, clean, excellent food, close to motorway, kids enjoyed kids club and other facilities.
Cons: room was small, bed uncomfortable, cold draught coming from floor under window.
No reply from hotel regarding teddy my son left behind accidentally. ",4,2016,03,26
249,Perfectly fine,"Breakfast ok - decaf coffee poor and bitter. Free Sunday newspaper. Strangled eggs very dry - looked like they were from a packet. The rest very good.

Reception very helpful. 
Hotel huge - long walks to/from room.

Bed comfortable. Slept well. Well provisioned. Parking underground. Safe.",4,2016,03,25
249,Great hotel,I have stayed at this hotel many times and find it to tick all the boxes. It's located around 15 mins from Dublin by car but has great parking and facilities. It also has a large shopping and cinema complex near by which has plenty of places to eat. The staff in the hotel are helpful and the rooms comfy and clean. I'd recommend to give the hotel a go before trying to get one in the centre.,5,2016,03,25
249,Fantastic for family stay!!,"We loved everything about here especially the interjoining rooms perfect for kids to stay in one room and adults in another where theyr safe! Fridge, microwave etc! Dinner in the restaraunt was devine!! The one fault was they didnt have my favourite drink strawberry & lime kopenburg 😭 Kids loved the mocktails! Fantastic helpful and pleasant staff! Jotel is spotless. Straight accross from a fantastic shopping centre also! I coukd write lots of positives!",5,2016,03,24
249,"Ok, Hotel very simlar to a Super 8/Best Western in the US","I would say this hotel is ok, not sure how it compares to price vs other hotel's in the area, the pictures can be misleading as the hotel has a very old look inside and out. I booked this hotel through a travel agent, prepaid for the hotel room. I went to pay for parking at the front desk they ended up charging me credit card 400 dollars for the room again even though I prepaid for it. I noticed it was pending the day I left and I was told that it was just a hold and it would fall off in a few days. Ok, still an inconvenience then when I checked to see if the hold came off, I noticed they charged my card that amount so I paid for my room twice. To top it off first I called and the person I spoke to said he would get back to me today to let me know what can be done. After speaking to a manager I was told I will have my money back in 7-10 days.  To me customer  service goes along way and this is one hotel I would not recommend due to my issue.",2,2016,03,24
249,Great stay,Lovely hotel staff could not be nicer dinner was fab room clean and comfortable had to pay for parking was the only thing I didn't like  free WiFi in the hotel the bar was lovely qgain staff very nice would recommend staying here,5,2016,03,24
249,Very disappointing,"Stayed here on recent visit to city. Room looked well used and tired looking and single bed's mattress was very bumpy. Thought the room smelled a bit smokey too. Breakfast was not a pleasant experience especially when we had children with us. No Apple juice, croissants stale, very little choice for anyone who didn't want to eat a full Irish breakfast. These are simple and non expensive things to rectify, and it would make a big difference.",2,2016,03,23
249,Wedding Reception,"On behalf of myself and my new wife, I would like to say that we had an absolutely fantastic time at the reception in the Clarion Hotel.

The staff were fantastic (courteous, respectful and so forth), and the food was delicious (all the guests commented on how lovely the food was).

In terms of the wedding and events manager (Biruite), we have to say she was brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble for her, and she went out of her way to make sure that every detail was exactly as we wanted.

Arthur too was most helpful with his many useful and insightful suggestions. These two people (along with the rest of the wonderful staff) are an absolute credit to the Clarion Hotel, and indeed the Hotel business in Ireland.

The staff at the menu tasting were brilliant too; they made us feel very special.

We also really enjoyed the breakfast food the following morning, and the ambience of the restaurant.

Not forgetting the resident DJ too, who was very accommodating.

So, overall, we have to say that we would absolutely recommend the Clarion Hotel as a wedding venue to any prospective couples who are planning their weddings.

So once again, a big thank you to everyone at the Clarion Hotel who made our special day even more special. 

Richard and Arceli",5,2016,03,23
249,very nice hotel,"Lovely hotel, room was fantastic. Very clean! stopped three nights and had a meal in kudos and two in gusto both fantastic meals! sometimes you could hear doors slamming at night but wasnt too bad. alot of children when we stayed so no good if your wanting an adult only break",4,2016,03,23
249,Dublin stay,I have stayed here on a number of occasions and have found staff very friendly and rooms big and comfortable. €6 charge for overnight parking a bit steep considdering location as still need to get bus or luas into city  ,4,2016,03,23
249,Easter Fun for the family,"Great location, room was spacious and clean with king size and two single beds.  Reception were helpful and efficient - gave us information on visiting the zoo and Tayto Park as well as explaining the kids club, breakfast etc.  Breakfast both days was lovely and whilst there was an initial queue, this was soon moving and we were seated.  Had dinner in Gusto and enjoyed it very much.  Kids also enjoyed the pool - although lockable lockers would have been an advantage.  Overall a great stay and we will definitely return",4,2016,03,23
249,Clarion hotel,"Not overly happy with my stay, had to wait almost half an hour to get checked in - it was busy but other staff walked passed reception without evening making eye contact with guests in the queue.  Arrived to be told pool had closed it was 7:30 and that I would have an additional cost for parking.

Room was clean and bed very comfortable but walls are paper thin between bedrooms, I could tell what my neighbours were watching on tv!",2,2016,03,23

249,March 2016,"Great stay,  the staff were very friendly and helpful
Restaurants were very good and we really enjoyed the food . The rooms were clean and comfortable . The swiming pool is great but it gets very crowded, but that's because the hotel was full",5,2016,03,23
249,Weekend break,Clean hotel very good breakfast staff were friendly. We were on the ground floor was very noisy from early morning. Very dissapoinment that we had to pay for parking considering how much we paid for the room it was not cheap ,3,2016,03,22
249,Great family break,Very good location & great value family break. Kids love this hotel & the executive rooms are a great choice as mum & dad get a break too! The bathrooms however are tight for space. We had a 90 minute wait for our room which was the only fault I could find. Thank you Clarion for a great stay. ,4,2016,03,22
249,Family stay,"My family stayed for one Saturday night in March 2016. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food was tasty but more staff required in bar at lunchtime. Our room was on 3rd floor facing motorway & near service lift, very loud and as result we had disturbed sleep. ",3,2016,03,22
249,Very Good,"Efficient service, nice playground for children, breakfast buffet had the main items you would expect but only scrambled eggs which disappointed my eldest as she wanted a boiled egg.
Overall the hotel is in a very good location only 20 minutes or so from Dublin city and right beside a large shopping centre. I would recommend going back.",4,2016,03,22
249,"Clean hotel, great breakfast",We stayed for 4 nights. Close to large mall and bus lines into Dublin city center. Hotel has great breakfast in dining room. Other restaurants are also in hotel complex. There is also a gym with a steam room and hot tub. Rooms are clean and modern. Staff is efficient and friendly. Airport transfers to airport are available for about 9 euros a person. Hotel is about 20 minutes from city center Dublin.,4,2016,03,21
249,A great place to stay,"Great hotel, very friendly, go the extra mile staff and service!
Even when our outdated satnav took us into Dublin City Centre, the hotel staff knew exactly where I was and provided spot on directions to where the hotle actually was.",5,2016,03,21
249,good hotel for a overnight stay,"overnight stay had going to something in Dublin

249,Midweek Trip Great Hotel.,"This is an excellent hotel and good value for money. Location approx. 20 min from Dublin City centre.
The hotel is clean and very comfortable, with a great breakfast being served.
The Staff are very professional and could not do enough for us.

If you are travelling to Dublin, consider staying at The Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley.",5,2016,03,21
249,Great,"Great hotel, but would have preferred city centre stay. Was lovely hotel but not a lot to do around hotel. Didn't use hotel facilities but there's suppose to be a lot to do. Very reasonable price for our stay.",5,2016,03,21
249,Shower in 730 broken,"Hotel promotes great showers!! My was broken, making me late for meetings, reported this and still wasn't fixed as promised. Should of checked before, morning came again and still not fixed. After spending over 500 euro on a two night stay with bar bills, I would of thought a shower is a simple thing. Receptionist was more interested in charging me 6 euros for the car park. Apart from the shower the food and room was spot on.",1,2016,03,21
249,Nice hotel,"I like this hotel, close to M50 and N7, nicely decorated, good wifi, desk staff generally nice, restaurant staff lovely. 
Desk couldn't give me an emery board for 'health & safety' reasons??
Be careful if using underground car park, entrance is extremely tight and on a corner. 
",4,2016,03,20
249,Fine Dublin Hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days in March 2016. Comfortable,large,pleasant and clean rooms with excellent friendly service from all the staff we encountered during our stay. Breakfast food quality and variety excellent, very good table service. Meals taken in  both Italian and Asian in house restaurants were excellent if not a little expensive. Free wifi throughout the hotel, very good free parking facilities. Very good location just off the M50 motorway just 20 minutes from the airport and 25 minutes from the centre of Dublin. The hotel benefits from a very large shopping centre right on its doorstep. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a base to visit Dublin.",4,2016,03,20
249,Brilliant,"Good people very friendly up for a laugh but very professional , good taxi service to and from the hotel , and they were very good with two young woman coming in from a night out dropped us down water next morning very good if you ask me . ",5,2016,03,20

On the outskirts of Dublin so great place to base your visit from .
Good gym and swimming pool . Restaurants are good and a variety near by in Liffey valley ",5,2016,03,19
249,Door closers!!!!,"The hotel itself isn't that bad, the room was well equipped, food in the restaurant was good, close to the shopping centre (which Dublin lacks).  Our biggest gripe is the hallway doors and their lack of door closers!  As I lie here now (08:05) the doors have been banging persistently all night, which in turn due to the air pressure rattles our bedroom door, so I have had to wedge it shut.  All I ask is that you install something to make them close slowly and not bang like hell!!!!  We are here for one more night and need to get on a bus at 4am, so management, if you are reading this, can you sort out the doors on level 1 at the corner of the building facing the N4 motorway please!?",3,2016,03,18
249,paying for parking is cheap shot,Pool area in showers is filthy. Smell of carpets in halls is disgusting.cheap carpet cleaner used to try and clear out odour. Steam room is disgusting. Would not go to this hotel again. Not charging for parking may help first impressions,1,2016,03,17
249,HOTEL NICE ..DONT PARK CAR HERE BREAK INS !,"I was in having major neck surgery and disc replacement surgery in the hermitage hubby stayed in hotel for 2 nights i had all my pillows and blankets in our van for drive home and my clothes ...BASTARDS broke into van over night stole my pillows ,blanket and clothes !! and a few wee bits hubby bought in target ...hotel sealed up window said this NEVER happens to my husband now i read different on sites ..DISGRACE ...this hampered my return home and left me very upset we had stop and buy some more stuff and get window replaced which has cost us a lot of money",2,2016,03,17

Lots of plugs in room for laptops and phone chargers, that are above the desk.  Which makes a pleasant change. ",5,2016,03,17
249,stayed for concert weekend,Good value for money good location. Front of house staff need to be bit more pleasant. Didn't like having to pay 50 deposit on arrival. Wanted to try the new Italian restaurant but opened at 6pm which was late I thought as we had plans from 530 onwards so went to liffey valley for food.,3,2016,03,16
249,Staff was terrible,Staff just did not give a dam about the customers did not in any way care about what we had to say was not helpful was not willing to help did not want to know about what we thought and did not care left wife sitting in the reception for 30 minutes and then told her that they could not deal with her that it had to be me the person that signed for the room just a total joke,1,2016,03,15
249,Enjoyable getaway,"I cannot fault this hotel it was perfect for our family getaway. The location was perfect, close to major roads And less than twenty minutes from Dublin City centre. Staff very friendly. Music in bar which we love. ",5,2016,03,15
249,Good for families,"Convenient location, good sized rooms, perfect for families, great facilities, great dining, helpful staff. A car valet and luggage service for young families would have made our stay much much easier but that's a small complaint for such a stay.",4,2016,03,15

The hotel is easy to find from the M50 and has good transport links to the city centre. It is also adjacent to the well known Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.
Nice staff, nice rooms, good breakfasts and had a very good evening meal in the Gusto restaurant.",4,2016,03,14
249,Lovely lunch and service,"Had lovely lunch with few of my friends in the Clarion Hotel. The two employees who looked after us Julija and Sharon were absolutly delightful, made us feel welcomed and looked after us well and the food was very nice. I will make sure to be back again!",4,2016,03,14
249,Liffey Vally,"Great beds, very clean rooms, good pool for kids, Very close to shopping and cinema. Great idea for dinner and cinema tickets combined. Disappointing that we had to pay extra for parking given it is not in city centre. Staff could be a bit more helpful at reception.",4,2016,03,14
249,Not a four star experience.,"Slow breakfast service and for a four star hotel it  lacked star quality finishing touches. The bar was cold in appearance and atmosphere, extremely overpriced and lacked night time food options. There's also an awful view at breakfast. ",2,2016,03,13
249,Rowdy hotel,"The hotel itself is OK, I thought the staff were friendly and very helpfull and the room was nice. However not their fault but still reflects on the hotel, I've spent quieter nights in hostels and hotel rooms in ibiza than here. We stayed Thursday to Sunday ground floor as a couple. Didn't sleep a wink Saturday night hearing drunk yobs shouting to get in their rooms, middle aged women screaming in the next room and even hearing one being sick in the toilet. Nice!! You get what you pay for I'm afraid..will not make that mistake again",3,2016,03,13
249,Great value,"This is a very nice mid range hotel. The staff are friendly and the hotel is very clean and well maintained. The room was well presented and spacious and comfortable. Slept very well, wi-fi and television both worked well. The staff were friendly and efficient. ",4,2016,03,13
249,Don't eat in this hotel.,I had dinner and 1 night stay here with my daughter for her 18th. Was very sick all night after eating.  Haven't been sick like this in years. Complained at reception in the morning and manager was called. I was cross questioned about everything I had eaten the previous day and told how careful they are about hygiene?  Didn't get an apology for terrible night or even my money back for the food that obviously was dangerous to eat. Was handed a ticket to get out of the car park though. I wonder why!,1,2016,03,12
249,bad service,Im highly disguisted with the service. Not even a manager over to apologise. I wont be recommending to any family or friends and there will be no more family partys here as this is were we hold our family functions,2,2016,03,12
249,Lovely hotel,"Food was excellent, staff were really friendly and helpful, room was very comfortable. Could not find fault with this hotel. Very close to shopping centre which was great. I will stay in this hotel again soon I hope.",5,2016,03,12
249,Excellent service!,"I stayed at the Clarion for two nights for an early appt. at the nearby Hermitage Med Clinic. The Clarion staff were so helpful and friendly arranging taxis, meals to my room, expediting check out, and even going the extra mile noticing when a door needed held open or a bag carried. The room was cozy and quiet. Appreciated my stay very much. ",4,2016,03,12
249,Family hols - great time.,"Great location very family friendly great area to stay with family in Dublin. Room was ver spacious. The sitting room area was a bit small. We had a suite the children sleep in the sitting room on a pull out. Was great having a kitchenette for the babies bottles and foods. I could hear pipes during the night. The room didn't smell super fresh when we arrived but freshened up when I left the window open for 10mins a little off putting, you want to arrive thinking no one has every stayed here before ! I was disappointed parking wasn't included but I guess we were on room only so maybe I'm a tad unfair expecting that. The room was far too hot but this in my opinion is a fault in every hotel. Overall we were very happy and would definitely stay again. ",4,2016,03,12
249,NICE LOOKING HOTEL BUT DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY THE COVER,Would not recommend this hotel due to extremely high noise levels on ground floor albeit that the beds are comfortable and staff very nice its not much good when you cant sleep.  The breakfast was good and well laid out for guests.  I dont know what can be done to alleviate the noise levels but its very off putting for a family who have been woken during the night on two occasions.,1,2016,03,11
249,Staff leave a lot to be desired. Also took service was terrible.,Had hassle checking in at 9. Was told the issue would be sorted by the time I came back from meetings. It wasn't. Girl had gone home sick. And Lucia was not helpful at all. She made the process awkward and as if I didn't want to pay for the room. That wasn't the issue. Then was hesitant to sort it for me. ,1,2016,03,11
249,Excellent,"Stayed with our 2 kids in a family room. 
Room was perfectly clean and really nice, only thing lacking was a/c.
Staff were top notch, really friendly and helpful.
Descent size pool with kids pool.
Restaurant is good as is bar.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,10
249,lovely hotel would stay again,"Lovely hotel, excellent food and great staff especially Sharon in the Italian restaurant. The pool was lovely, child friendly and clean. Bedrooms nice size and everything where it should be. Bus to city centre easy to get to. ",5,2016,03,09

249,Good overall stay,"Quick efficient chk in & out
Rooms clean
Good nites sleep
Good very good
Qued for 20 mins to b seated for breakfast
Food very good & good choice & is self service
Tea served quickly
Waited 10 mins on tea cups
Serious lack of staff management
There seemed to b a lot of staff but without direction
Rite beside shop centre & cinema
Beside bus stop to city centre & nite link home so no taxi expenses
Choice of restaurants
Good location",4,2016,03,09
249,Clean & Comfortable but Cheap Food not reflected in the prices,"Nice hotel with lovely comfortable rooms. Dining experience wasn't great. Small, bland portions with high prices. If we were staying at this hotel again we would eat out. Having said that we would probably be best off staying in the city as there wasn't anywhere else to go around without driving!  Very few of the staff were friendly, however, the ones that were, were really nice. Room service was really good and the rooms were spotless. Unfortunately, the food was a bit of a rip off including the snacks from the vending machine. ",3,2016,03,09
249,Highly recommended,"Great location, delicious food and very good service. We stayed in Clarion only one night but will definitely be back with kids this time. Big and clean pool. The only one thing I would change is the bed mattress which was very uncomfortable to sleep on. ",5,2016,03,09
249,Disappointing,"Very poor service upon check in, comfortable room, food ok,, overal standards have slipped over the years this is unfortunately no longer a value for money hotel, very overpriced for the standard of service and food, ",3,2016,03,08
249,Noise during night from other guests ruined experience,"Noise outside room at 4 in morning ruined stay, could not get back to sleep. Felt like some one walking past my bed, very annoying and disappointing , would stop me recommending this hotel to a friend",3,2016,03,08
249,great family room,"Best family room we've stayed in. Proper single beds for kids. Loads and loads of space in room. Nice pool. Handy location. Would definitely stay here again. Good base for exploring Dublin, and easy to get to, just off m50.",5,2016,03,08
249,SURPRISE 50th Birrthday Party,"Started badly. Been arrangiing this surprise for 3 months with Ciara(Events) Booked 3 rooms Friday 4th March and 12 rooms for Saturday 5th and buffet for 30 adults and 6 children. When i my wife and 2 children checked in the girl in Reception saud ""you are here for the 50th Birthday Party"". Wife heard and almost ruined everthing.(not her fault should have been on the computer)",3,2016,03,08
249,Family rooms!,"Kept up all night because of a party in the room next to ours! Said to reception and their reply was ""oh""..... says it all! Pool and gym were very good as was both the service and food in the restaurant. I would return but a suite in a higher floor would be required.

",3,2016,03,08
249,Lovely evening,"Myself & my partner Michael went to dine in Kudos at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley on Friday evening - we availed of the ""movie meal deal"" which consisted of 2 courses and a movie pass for €23.95 each which I think is so reasonable , It was our first time to eat in the Clarion - I ordered the Szechuan beef with a side of rice & for starter had the spicy meatballs - both portions where huge and the food was sublime - from the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were attended to by a lady called Co Co, who was so very pleasant and attentive - it has been so long since we had an evening meal out and I just want to say Kudos! to all at Kudos, you made our night and we will definitely be back again!!",5,2016,03,07
249,Overall a great hotel,"I really enjoyed the stay and the reception personal was really nice. Food was ok and the service was great. The room and mostly the bed are very comfortable.
Spa was nice and clean, as well the gym.
The only thing I would improve is the room cleaning service. ",5,2016,03,07
249,Average hotel,"Food in the bar was good but the bathroom in room could have done with a good clean and the room was noisy, the staff are friendly, ample parking. Just the bathrooms really could do with being cleaned better! ",3,2016,03,07
249,Love It,"Great place to stay on business trip, fantastic room service, great food, very clean room. The only one minus is that its state the hotel is no smoking but quite strong smell of cigarettes in my room.",5,2016,03,04
249,friendly and clean hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The checkin was very quick. The hotel in general and the room were very clean. Very comfy bed and quality bedsheets. Friendly staff. Good breakfast. Didn't like the location, nothing around apart from a shopping center 15mins not a nice walk. On a motorway. Fine for a business stay if you don't have much plans for outside the hotel",4,2016,03,04
249,"Friendly, clean, good service, good location.","Friendly, clean, good service, good location. I stayed here because the Red Cow down the road was holding an exhibition and it was full. This was a good choice and I have no complaints. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,03,04
249,Cracking hotel,"Awesome place this. Would definitely stay here again. We visited here to stay the night to attend friends wedding next day & couldn't fault it.

249,1 night getaway,"Nice hotel, clean and comfortable room. Close to Liffey valley shopping centre, quiet surroundings. Beautiful breakfast (FRESH food added right up until closing time - lots of hotels don't replace after 9:30/10am). Great food selection. Friendly, chatty staff who appeared to enjoy their work. Overall great value, pleasant stay!",5,2016,03,02
249,Clarion liffey valley,This hotel is fantastic but skip on the meal as very poor if you want a nice sit down meal. 4.25 is ridiclous for chips that should come with the dinner and wine is averaging 27 upwards. Breakfast is fit for a king and staff are lovely,5,2016,03,02
249,Stay for course,"The hotel is lovely, the rooms were very luxurious and they were very clean. Staff were very friendly. Only thing add to wait quite while we're picking up a bag at one stage, the other tile was very fast. The rooms were quite noisy you could really hear the people going up and down the corridor. But it's a really nice hotel ",4,2016,03,02
249,Thank you,"I would like to thank all Clarion Hotel staf for exelent job. You did all best, I feel vey comfortable to return from working in clear and warm room. The car parting was good. Breakfct- exeelnt. Thank you. ",5,2016,03,02
249,"Good Price, very comfortable","Enjoyed my stay here, we called the front desk for extra linens and they were delivered within minutes! The one upset was that it is not located in the center of the city. We had to take taxis in and out a few times. Besides that it was a great stay.",4,2016,03,01
249,Mona Sinclair,"Fantastic hotel fantastic staff very professional,friendly,caring,honest they couldn't do enough for us the food at our sons 21st was fantastic the staff made our event & stay a fantastic one Thank You",5,2016,03,01

Brilliant hotel for a Family Break",5,2016,03,01
249,mini break with kids,"We have stayed here many times, always enjoy it, my kids love it also.  A fantastic treat for parents and kids, with great food and facilities. at one stage my daughter lost her teddy here a few yrs ago, we got it back, another time she left brand new shoes which were thankfully posted to on us.  I have to say it really is one of our favourite places to go.  The food in gusto is lovely and the service is 5 star (and we have been to a lot of hotels in Ireland over the years).  Special thanks to Shauna in the restaurant last sat night 27th feb.  She was fantastic and such a pleasure.  She and all the staff I dealt with are a credit to the hotel.",4,2016,03,01
249,Trip to Dublin,This was the only hotel we could find that could accomodate a family of 4 with two single beds plus a queen.  Our overall stay was very comfortable and we would definately stay here again.  Good location.,4,2016,03,01
249,Badly needed break away with my boys,"Myself and my two boys wanted a time out retreat together after a very difficult month, we got just that at the Clarion Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful, discrete but there if any help was needed. Coming from the west ourselves the location is ideal and being so close to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre was an added bonus, a visit to the cinema and Pirates Island were a must. ",4,2016,03,01
249,Family stay,"Booked 2 rooms for family of 7, interconnecting, family room, 1 double and 2 singles, a bit tight on space but having interconnecting helped, kids lived the pool area, breakfast 11 euro, good value for adult, a bit steep for small members of family, overall good value and pleasant experience. ",4,2016,03,01
249,A nice night away.,We come here quite often and it's always a pleasure. Beds are always comfortable and always have a great sleep. Food is always beautiful. Staff are very friendly and always on Han t help with anything at all. Reception is excellent. ,5,2016,02,29
249,Jarek,"Very good price for great services !!
Friendly staff ,free swimming pool , Italian restaurant had fantastic service and very tasty food.
Nice and quiet rooms,parking beside hotel, 30 min to Dublin City Centre .",4,2016,02,28
249,Adequate ,"Based just out side Dublin and close to a shopping centre and cinema, so not really suitable if you want to see Dublin
The hotel is ok, lots of long corridors so you end up getting lost or walking in circles
Rooms a well appointed and clean, staff are friendly and helpful 
They have two restaurants an Italian and what the call a eastern fusion, I used the latter food was good and also good value 

",3,2016,02,27
249,midterm break,We love this hotel and always enjoy staying there. Excellent service all round. The Pizzas are gorgeous and the food from the lemongrass restaurant is fab also.  we love that there is so much variety and you do not have to go far for it. This time we found the room a bit too warm though.,5,2016,02,27
249,Very comfortable Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights...very comfortable and spotless room. Good Breakfast. ..very nice leisure centre....very good service. ...bar not exciting though. It is very convenient for the city if you are driving, off peak travel to city centre no more than 20 mins.  I will stay there again ",4,2016,02,26
249,No Sleep pool dirty,Our family have stayed in this hotel a few times but the standards have dropped. We are a family with young kids and so we all need to sleep but when the hole floor is partying and the floor above you are doing the same its hard to do this. it takes a lot for me to complain as I understand people are away enjoying themselves but this was over the top. We made a complaint to reception but all I go was we will try and have a word. It got so bad I had to go net door and ask the to stop (and they did after two more knocks on the door). so no sleep so next morning we went down to the pool everything ok until we got into the kids pool. The kids pool was so dirty there is a ring of grime around the wall of the pool.,3,2016,02,26
249,Weekend stay,"Lovely stay, very comfortable beds, free swimming pool for guests, nice restaurants, friendly staff, very good value for the price, our little boy (3) had a great time on swimming pool and kids play area.",4,2016,02,25

249,weekend away,Easy to get to from Belfast. Staff very helpful and friendly. Gustos food and service excellent. Pool facilities very good and clean. Rooms large and clean. Only gripe was paying for parking but can't have everything!,5,2016,02,24
249,Family Stay,"Great hotel near liffey valley centre , cinema etc
Hotel was lovely and kid friendly, would not recommend breakfast as queues are quiet long
Food in bar and restaurants are top quality.
Family rooms are quite big",4,2016,02,24
249,Visit with family and grandaughters 5 &8,"We arrived last Friday afternoon. Kids in pool which although crowded was very good. Rooms were excellent and clean. In Italian restaurant, limited menu but food was very good and served piping hot. In Kudos Asian restaurant on Saturday food good, pleasant live music from 9.30 until 11pm. The pool was again a big success. Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. ",4,2016,02,23
249,Pleasantly surprised,"I would highly recommend this hotel .  Stayed at weekend and unbelievable value for Dublin and great thing in relation to travel taxi rang right outside reception door and very efficient.  Hotel itself was very clean, reception area very inviting and staff efficiently doing their job quickly and in friendly manner.   Room was really nice, comfortable bed and warm without being stuffy and fresh air though open window(can be rare nowdays).  Only problem i had was for a superior room shower was integrated into bath and for personal reasons i could not use(this was my own fault should have clarified).  Food in bar was very good prompt and even though it was very busy we had only short wait and waiter was exceptionally nice.   i would stay here again without hesitation and it is now TOP OF MY LIST for  places to stay in Dublin",5,2016,02,23
249,Hotel Stay,"Key card didnt work in the room, had to go back to reception.. We had a busy corridor, lots of kids around and noisey neighbours had their tv up very loud.
The bed was hard and it was 2 separate beds pushed together rather than a double bed.",2,2016,02,23
249,Clarion Liffey Valley,"Travelling from Galway to Dublin, this is the hotel I choose to stay at when attending concerts, or even for a weekend break away. From Check -in to Check out, there is not one thing I could fault this hotel on, greeted by a smile at all times.",5,2016,02,23
249,Clarion hotel Liffey valley,"Great hotel very family friendly

Great way to wake up. The location was great for shopping as Liffey Valley Centre very close by. Parking was very secure. All in all a great stay.,5,2016,02,23
249,Disastrous family break.,"From beginning to end, there was nothing but problems. The only part we enjoyed was the pool!!! Staff at front desk and gusto restaurant were very rude and dismissing. Will not return to this hotel again.",2,2016,02,23
249,Clarion liffey valley,"Could be better. Stayed many times, so we decided to come with a baby for family weekend. Becouse of the broken window our sleep was ruined! The winds were blowing in and was cold in the room. We didnt get any sleep",4,2016,02,23
249,Great Family Hotel,"Great facilities for our grandchildren - real beds in the family room and the pool was a great draw. During our excellent meal in the restaurant a clown came and whisked the kids off to a kids club next door from 7-9. 
Hotel is very central next to Liffey Valley shopping center and on a bus route to Dublin City Centre",5,2016,02,22
249,Family one night stay.,Hi found this hotel v good for overnight stay for me and my twins. .v Good if attending the 3 arena.v helpful staff we got late check out at 2pm no extra cost as we were late checking in after the concert..pool etc breakfast was lovely would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,02,22
249,Nothing major to complain about but nothing to recommend either.,"I can only describe this hotel as average, I can't exactly put my finger on any major issue. It was all just very ""MEH"". Staff were okay, the room was clean but not really comfortable. The food in the Kudos restaurant was nice but the table had big chips and dents in it. Finally, I am aware it was coming to the end of midterm and therefore, you had a lot of kids and families in the hotel but to allow families to let their children run rampant was the biggest let down by far. Priority should be given to all guests-not just those who are booking more rooms. Definitely not value for money either.",3,2016,02,22
249,"Very good location, Price, Food and service","We will be  be back again. Very good location, Price, Food and service.  Staff are very friendly and take good care of the guests. Highly recommended. Just beside Liffey Valley Shopping center. Very good for families.",5,2016,02,22
249,This Hotel ticks all the right boxes,"Excellent location, the staff were very friendly and helpful and it was close to all the amenities and the City Centre is only a short cab journey.

I also used the Leisure centre facilities and they were clean and very convenient, the staff were extremely helpful overall a very pleasant experience.",5,2016,02,22
249,A comfortable stay,"Easy access to the airport by air hopper bus. The swimming, steam and sauna help to ease travel stress and the friendliness of staff made my stay a relaxing time to meet with friends in Dublin. The proximity to Liffey Valley shopping centre is also a big plus and a way of topping up with supplies for my return. I keep coming back",4,2016,02,22
249,Extremely family friendly ,I found this hotel to be very clean and comfortable the room was brilliant best hotel room I've been in breakfast was lovely. The facilities for children and activities provided for them are fantastic will definitely be back :),5,2016,02,21

249,Just what you you would expect,"Staff ignored me when I entered the oriental restaurant, starter failed to arrive when main meal was booked. I also left a car key in the room, a text or phone call from the hotel would have saved a lot of aggravation. Overall a plastic dehumanised service.",3,2016,02,21
249,We will always come back!,"We really like this hotel , stayed at least 6 times now and have always been happy,staff are very friendly and helpful restaurant staff are so pleasant and smiley.rooms are clean and comfortable lovely comfy beds.only things is the traffic outside but that cant be helped.great location with liffey valley a few mins walk.will defo stay here again !",5,2016,02,21

249,Four star my bottom,"Heating only comes on 7-9pm, and ours never did they had it turned off in room, the room was freezing, upon complaining they gave us a plug in heater which isn't ideal when you have a 3+7yr old.  The hot breakfast was all dried out rashers like cardboard",3,2016,02,21
249,family trip,"Overall a good hotel. The only fault I could find with the hotel is that we had to pay for parking.  I feel that this should have included in the price. Staff helpful, friendly.  Hotel clean,  big cues for breakfast if you hit it at the wrong time.",4,2016,02,21
249,Ticks all the boxes for us !!,Back again for another three night break and as good as all the other times. Love the Asian menu in the bar and a New bonus in Gusto their Italian restaurant ...had a really great choice of food and my daughter loved it. As usual all staff were professional and friendly. Bus into town €4.10 for adult and child ....so handy to leave car in car park if touring  the city. Bed Room spotless and quiet. Great pool and facilities. We will be back again and again.,5,2016,02,20
249,Good hotel for family,"Good hotels for family . Clean rooms , food ok ,staff friendly I was in the hotel three times I had no problems, the leisure center is clean. Close to shopping centre , kids love swimming pool thanks , I will be back soon.",4,2016,02,20

249,Ok business hotel,"Ok hotel for business reasons. I will go for a hotel closer to city centrum if I come back with my family.
But the hotel is good and the staff take good care of the guests. Dry air at the room but overall it's been a nice stay.",4,2016,02,20

Room clean and big, good shower, odd toilet flushing tho. All staff great, ate one meal at Asian restaurant and one at Italian. Good food and value. The shopping center is 10 minute walk. Enjoyed our stay and would recommend ",5,2016,02,18
249,"Great time, great value","Booked this hotel for a last minute city break. As a couple with a three year old, this was a great hotel, very family friendly. Room had ample space, easy to get to local shops and not far from the city centre. 
Would definitely come back.
Only thing that could have been better, would be some kind of evening entertainment for the children. ",4,2016,02,18
249,I luv Dublin,"Everything was perfect. 10mins walk to the shopping mall. Kids enjoyed  Nandos, Burger King and Macdonalds food at the mall. Also hotel food was fab. The pool and jacuzzi water was warm and clean too. Easy to reach Dublin city daily.  The local bus tour cost us 10 euro for one adult and 3 kids. There is an airport bus that comes at the hotel regularly and we paid 20 euro for a family of 4 one way ticket. ",5,2016,02,18
249,Family friendly,A really nice family friendly hotel. It's location was great as it is in close proximity to liffey valley shopping centre. The zoo and tatyo park are very easily accessible.

249,expensive breakfast,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Room very clean, comfortable and quiet.
Recommended by Heritage Clinic nearby to which we had to go in the morning.   
Breakfast not great - very expensive  - rashers and black pudding very hard to eat",5,2016,02,17
249,Conference ,Attended a awards ceremony here. Good reception on arrival. Bedrooms clean and tidy with good facilities for overnight guest. Wifi good through out the venue. Parking is ample underground be sure to ask for ticket on departure. Food is good and varied menu.  ,3,2016,02,17
249,Short proximity to great amenities,Aside from being a comfortable and plush spot to spend a weekend in. One the Clarion's greatest assets is its immediate proximity to one of the best shopping centres in the country. This facility is within walking distance and provides a state of the art cinema and countless restaurants.,5,2016,02,17
249,Good experience apart from the breakfast service,"Good overall experience of the hotel, friendly staff, clean hotel, nice swimming pool and facilities. Breakfast was a let-down. Had eaten our cereal and returned to the buffet to get more breakfast. When we returned the whole table had been cleared and reset for new people, including our pot of tea, pastries e.t.c which was a waste of good food. Other than that shops e.t.c. were easily accessible from the hotel. ",4,2016,02,17
249,Family stay,"Lovely hotel and friendly staff,very helpful. Excellent facilities. Parking. Swimming pool and WiFi. Great effort for Valentine's.  Lovely baloons in dining room.  Flowers chocs and bubbles.  Would definately stay again.

",5,2016,02,17
249,Our Stay,"Upon arrival, we were welcome very politely by the receptionist, who explained to us about dining with them but not a lot about the services. Entering our room we were happy with the cleanliness and presentation. The shower was perfect. Unfortunately not much sleep was had as the mattress was too hard for our liking. Dining in the morning was slow waiting but the food made up for the wait. We had a lovely stay and would recommend to our friends and we hopefully like to return. ",4,2016,02,17
249,Disappointing stay,"Would not recommend 
Only wanted two well done boiled eggs for breakfast they came out soft 
As I'm lactose and gluten intolerant could not eat much else, no signs saying alternatives available asked for coffee only instant available so I had a glass of water ",2,2016,02,16
249,Family celebrations ,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed in Clarion once again a very enjoyable stay we booked 2 nights bed and breakfast with 1 evening meal which consisted of 3 course in Gusto restaurant some in party paid extra  €7 for steaks meal beautiful no complaints. Rooms clean , beds comfortable fridge in room .  Nearby liffey valley shopping centre excellent , Dublin about 10 minutes in car ,   we made use of the pool , jacuzzi and sauna and also the kids play area in hotel .found staff to be very friendly and helpful possible one exception tall bar  manager I think but maybe he was having an off day as he was grumpy when passing guests no acknowledgement which seemed a shame but as I've said maybe an off day otherwise staff fantastic would recommend hotel to families. ",5,2016,02,16
249,Coming from Airport,Room too noisy. No brown soda bread or fried eggs for breakfast. Breakfast much too expensive 300% too expensive.Staff very friendly. Bedroom very clean & comfortable..Staff at reception were excellent. We had to queue for breakfast. .. No need.I would stay on hotel again .. Room only for value and convenience,4,2016,02,16
249,Mixed reviews!!,On arrival to the hotel we were impressed.  Our room was good 1 dble and 2 sgle beds not much space for anything else. We took the kids to the pool they absolutely loved it by far the biggest and best kids pool we have seen in any of the hotels we have stayed in... Get more that one towel per person tho the towels are TINY!! Pool and changing rooms are warm and well equipped.... The restaurants weren't particularly good for kids (this may have just been our fussy eaters) we foolish went to Gusto (€11.90 for 4 sausages and 1 small bowl of plain cooked spaghetti).. The kids had been looking forward to goin to play the wii unfortunately it was not working.. The did seem to have a great itinerary for kids with movies on each night but this again unfortunately started the day we checked out. The main 2 downsides to our stay was the major road noise all night and the beds with creaked and squeaked with every move... Breakfast was good however this is the first hotel I have ever stayed in that did not serve apple juice!! Having mentioned this road noise to reception on check out the receptionist apologised and offered us an upgrade to an executive suite and a court facing room if we decide to return to the hotel... The jury's out on the return visit as yet!! ,3,2016,02,15
249,Poor Front Desk welcome,"We were left standing whilst the two receptionists dealt with the one customer. Then when it was our turn to check in no apology, no smile, no welcome just a well rehearsed script of up selling the other facilities provided by the hotel eg. restaurant etc. Bad start and made us feel quite deflated!",3,2016,02,15
249,Great family friendly hotel!,"Good accessibility, easy to resch by car or  Airport Hopper., about 15 min to City Center and 15 min to Airport. Shopping mall 5 min Walk.
Good value for money, friendly and helpfull staff. Great facilities( Gym, Pool, restaurants)",5,2016,02,15
249,Valentines stay,"My fiancé and I stayed here for valentines. Hotel itself is beautiful, room was lovely and comfortable. Ate in Kudos off the valentines menu and cannot say a bad word about this. Beautiful. Also ate breakfast as this was included in the price and it was lovely. No complaints overall. Will definitely stay again. Staff are very pleasant aswell. 5* ",5,2016,02,14
249,Very pleasant stay,"I always find the this hotel so accommodating & friendly.
Great rooms and breakfast is hearty if u want it..
It's close enough to the airport and accessible to the city. 
Will make time to use more facilities next time.
The bar is pleasant and has a nice atmosphere.. ",4,2016,02,13
249,Tops,"Stayed here a few times now and have never been disappointed. Room are spacious and clean, staff friendly. Shopping centre across the road has lots of the usual things and a very impressive cinema which the hotel does deals with in partnership with the restaurant ",5,2016,02,13
249,Was OK,"Stayed in this hotel for one night at the beginning of a bus tour around Ireland. I think we got the worst rooms in the hotel, right on the ground floor right next to the car park. The bathroom was very dated. During the night we kept getting woken up by people coming in and out of the hotel. The room got quite stuffy over night too, we couldn't leave the window open due to the noise. I know other rooms higher up are fine though - so if you stay in this hotel make sure you don't get a ground floor room! Breakfast and the hotel in general are fine.

The location would be a bit awkward for tourists trying to get into the city, as you have to take a bus to get there. The buses are frequent enough though.",3,2016,02,12
249,Peaceful night sleep,Had not stayed here before but decided to stay here due to its location. When we checked in our room faced the road and I did wonder would it be noisy but it did not affect us at all. Beds were comfortable and the rooms spacious. We ate in Kudos and had a couple of cocktails and all in all had a lovely stay here. Would definitely recommend and would have no hesitation in staying again.,5,2016,02,12
249,Brilliant service and food,"The only thing letting this hotel down was the not very powerful shower and the intermittent wifi.
Other than that I could not have asked for anything more from the staff - they were brilliant.
Food was also good (room service) ",4,2016,02,12
249,A great stay,"Enjoyed our 1 night stay in clean and comfortable family room for 2 adults and 2 children. Kids both had a single bed which was great as they usually have to share a sofa bed in other hotels we have visited. Friendly staff, great breakfast, pool is good and location is great.  We would recommend and will visit again.",4,2016,02,11
249,The hotel is very good. the staff are very professional and friendly. the food is average to poor.,"The location is great for Dublin if you have business to attend to in the city. Also the Liffey Valley Centre is a two minute drive away. The rooms are a very good standard. I have a rule to eat at the Lemongrass restaurant next door or somewhere else, the food is average and at times poor.",4,2016,02,10
249,Excellent,"One of the best, if the parking could be free, it would have been great. The room service was great along with male front help desk, overall myself and family had a great stay at the hotel, close to town and airport. I will surly lodge with you my next trip ",5,2016,02,10
249,First experience ...,"1st time here and everything was perfect. Very family friendly enviroment and staff, conviniently located rooms for us on the ground floor. Location was very close to our destination and just a walking distance from the shopping centre.",5,2016,02,09
249,Pleasant stay and good value for money!,"Stayed one night while on shopping trip, room very comfortable with all required facilities. Breakfast was lovely with pretty good choice to select from.Staff were very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay in the Clarion again",4,2016,02,09
249,a lovely hotel,Everything perfect in this hotel except the noise level at night...people running round...slamming doors and playing loud music until the early hours...no staff seem to be about to control it...but apart from that it was great,5,2016,02,09
249,An 'alright' hotel,"Stayed here on Saturday night as we were heading into Dublin for the night. We got a deal of €99 for one night with no breakfast included. 

Rooms were fine, roomy enough with everything you needed. Shower was a bit old fashioned....a lever thingie worked it rather than a more modern version. 

My 2 complaints would be the price they charge for breakfast and the fact that they charge you for parking! €6 each car so we paid an extra €12 for the night. The fact the hotel isn't in the middle of Dublin I really don't see why we had to pay to park....and to add insult to injury your ticket is validated for free parking if you attend a meeting, but not if you pay €100 to stay for a night! Might be worth considering if you are staying for a few nights. ",3,2016,02,08
249,Great family stay,"Stayed here while visiting the Dublin zoo.they cater very well for families and the family rooms were a good size with a double bed and two singles.the leisure facilities in the hotel were good with a separate child's swimming pool which was quite well sized and not the usual puddle most hotels offer.the leisure area however did come with a 5 euro deposit for locks to secure your stuff so make sure you bring your wallet to the swim in pool or you will not be able to get a secure locker. The hotel had 2 restaurants one of which was closed during our stay and so we ventured out for food as there are plenty of places nearby.
Parking is available in the hotels underground car park and this is not that expensive and was great as it was raining when we arrived.
Overall the hotel is well run,clean and value for money and I would return as it is well located.",4,2016,02,05
249,Business,"Good location, easy access to motorway, friendly and courteous staff, rooms comfortable and very clean, secure underground parking, should be complimentary for guests though.
Food in restaurant was quite good.",5,2016,02,04
249,Perfect location and lovely staff,"Staff were very pleasant and professional, hotel is very clean with a great location and good facilities. Only thing is when I made a complaint in the morning of checkout and staff member said ""I'll let maintenance know"". I didn't get an apology until I pushed the point. It's not the staff member's fault but I expected a bit more.  ",4,2016,02,04
249,Excelkent,"We always stay here when we visit Dublin. Very reasonably priced, lovely rooms, friendly staff, good location. Love the food in lemongrass restaurant, staff are great, We got the meal & cinema deal twice, great value. Love this hotel, will stay again. ",5,2016,02,04
249,Really nice hotel,Really nice stay would have liked to have stayed longer but only there for one night due to business commitments. Only negative was that we had to pay for car park it was extra and no included in the price of our stay.,4,2016,02,04
249,Clarion Liffey Valley - our favorite hotel in Dublin.,We always stay in Clarion in Liffey Valley. It ticks all our requirements in every way. Gusto restaurant food was fabulous. Loved the swim and breakfast. We had an executive room. Staff were very helpful and accommodating.,5,2016,02,03
249,Great Stay,"The staff member reported that the hotel, room and breakfast was great quality.  The only comeplint they had was the cleanliness of the gym and relaxation facilities.  Soem lockers did not lock, the jaquzzi looked very dirty and low in wtaer, There wasa smell form the drains around the steam room , pool and sauna.  This is a pity as the rest ofn the hotel ios great",5,2016,02,03
249,Hot room,"Lovley clean spacious room, very comfortable bed but impossible to sleep as the room and as so hot. It was like sleeping in a sauna. It will stop me comming back. Not much point having a lovley room you can't sleep in",3,2016,02,03
249,Comfortable stay,"Checked in early as we were coming from the south to attend a match. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, bathroom was small but had everything needed. Breakfast was very nice and plenty of options. We were not leaving til later in the day and the hotel gave us a late checkout. Enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,02,02
249,Good location,"We stayed for a weekend,lovely staff clean hotel and nice food.the people in the room next door kept us awake,we called reception and they sorted it,but our kids had lots of question about what was going on in the other room.",4,2016,02,02
249,excellent hotel,"I booked this hotel for its proximity to the Liffey Valley shopping centre as the teenagers were attending an event in the Vue. I booked a family room which was super clean had 2 single and 1 double bed there was plenty of space for the 3 of us, the beds were super comfy we each comented on the great sleep we had! The room had a flat screen TV,  iron + board,  great WiFi and bath with shower.  Our rate included breakfast and I must say the variety of food available was fantastic, we were seated quickly and the restaurant was light, bright and airy. We also had dinner in the bar and while the food was top notch and the service was excellent it was slightly disappointing that there was only Asian food available and nothing before 6pm! The other option for food is the restaurant which serves Italian food but you must make a reservation for this and it is also closed until 6pm ordinarily this wouldn't have bothered me but we had to be at the event by 7 and so time was tight. The car park is secure and cost €6 for the night do not too expensive but really car parking should be free when a hotel is in a location that you can't get to by public transport!! All in all these were very minor faults and had no real impact on our stay this is a lovely hotel and I have already recommended it to family and friends.",5,2016,02,01
249,Highly recommended!,This was a lovely hotel. All hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Went to Gusto restaurant and the food was fab there. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and come again myself. Was ideal location ,5,2016,02,01
249,Average experience,See previous comments.Some staff good some poor.Was charged €7.20 for whole milk when ran out off milk late in evening for my baby.Thought it could have been handled better.We needed to ask for the room to be cleaned as soon as we arrived and took photo of dirt on bed to show reception.The cot was terrible - we didn't use it.,3,2016,01,31
249,A new lease of life,"the restaurant staff were very good, new facelift makes
It modern in main area would stay again. I stayed here a long time ago and it was poor but I have to say it is a different hotel now and has impressed me. The gym facilities are well equipped and the staff are excellent. I use it for business travel and I find it homely ",4,2016,01,30
249,Good,"On a family trip to Dublin we stayed at this hotel . Booking & check in hassle free. found all staff excellent friendly and helpful. For 4* found room just ok needs bit of freshening up there was stuffiness in the room. Beds were very hard and uncomfortable not a good night's sleep at all. Went to pool twice staff friendly , kids loved it but it could do with bit of maintenance locker doors damaged etc and a good clean. We ate in the Italian restaurant it was fantastic really enjoyed it. Breakfast was ok only for burnt toast( which I'm sure toaster could be set better not to burn) and sausages tasted of poor quality. €6 for 24hrs carpark. Wifi was poor at times.Good location near shops. Overall had a nice stay biggest downfall was the hard mattress very poor nights sleep.",4,2016,01,30
249,Disappointing stay,"I was very disappointed with our stay in this hotel. As it was a special occasion I booked a superior double room. On arrival I was informed it was €6 per night for parking despite it stating free parking on the Hotel.com page. Walking into the hotel room my jaw dropped with disbelief at this was a superior double room....it was tiny...double bed....small bathroom. My expectations of this room were based on the pictures so the pics are very misleading. I didn’t complain regarding the room as when I checked my confirmation booking email it actually stated on the booking a double bed. Saturday morning the fire alarm went off at 8:15am ruining a deep sleep. Breakfast was ok nothing fantastic. Food in Kudos restaurant was ok..we ordered from the small bites menu and it was a small bite to eat. Sat night/Sun morning after midnight the fire alarm went off 5 times.....5 TIMES!! Other guests were coming out onto the corridor to find out what was going on and should they be evacuating.  There was an unnecessary queue on Sunday morning for breakfast even through there was plenty of free tables and managers running around like headless chickens.  The food was not great Sunday morning, after waiting 20-25 mins my partner had to ask twice of two different waiters for the poached egg he ordered.  On checkout I had every intention of informing the receptionist of my dismal stay but I was quickly checked out and wasn’t even asked if I enjoyed my stay. I don’t like been a keyboard warrior but as I didn’t get a chance to chat anybody I felt this was my only option.",3,2016,01,27
249,Weeekend Break,"Rooms are nice, clean and a good size. 
Lots to do at the hotel for kids - both younger and older. 
Pool area was nice - towels given great perk. 
Breakfast had a lot of choice 
Food in bar & hotel were nice",4,2016,01,27
249,family enjoyed,"hotel easy to find - staff friendly and helpful, kids loved the pool. great breakfast and dinner in Gustos restaurant, one problem was fire alarm going off during night - apart from that would recomend hotel and will return",4,2016,01,27
249,"Lovely staff, great food","We stayed here for one night with our 9 month old. It is a nice distance from city centre but there are plenty of buses available. Conveniently located near a shopping centre and cinema.
We ate in the main restaurant in the evening and the food was tasty and reasonably priced. Waiting staff were lovely and very helpful. Room was warm and quiet and bed comfortable. There was a reasonable charge on parking.",4,2016,01,26
249,Clarion hotel weekend break,This hotel is brilliant with excellent service. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a weekend break. The food was beautiful and the staff were lovely. We got a deal directly through the website. It was excellent value for money ,5,2016,01,26
249,Clarion Liffey Valley,"I have stayed here on numerous previous occasions and this hotel standards have dropped badly. The glasses were filthy in the bar and multiple people were returning to get replaced. LOTS of LIPSTICK. Experienced the bar manager arguing with 4 other guests about 95 cents for a blackcurrent. It became so uncomfortable that we had to move as I had children with me. The fire alarm went of in the aftenoon as a false alarm and then again at 03:00am x 3 times and I had a child in tears. When I went to reception they hadnt a clue on what was wrong but as an engineer I explained that there was a zone fault. Next morning I was spun a yarn of 2 x different stories, one by receptionist and a different by theduty manager. Asked for tea at breafast and got half tea half coffee in a pot. ",3,2016,01,26
249,Great location great place for kids,"Great location great place for kids Noisy neighbours and the fire alarm going off in the early hours of the morning with 3 young kids in the room was rather annoying. The hotel was nice staff were friendly the room was a lot smaller than it looked on the website bit of a squash for 2 adults and 3 kids, but it did the job.",4,2016,01,26
249,good family hotel,nice interconnecting rooms. Problem with first room leak in bathroom but immediately dealt with by reception staff and rooms changed.  Breakfast nice. We swam twice and kids really enjoyed that. All in all a good weekend. Would go again for sure.,4,2016,01,26
249,very expensive,was a good stay staff are good location is good just off the m50 which makes any hotel but the expense of staying there and also eating there is off putting pool is nice my son loved it and thats the main thing. bring prices down 13.00 euro 4 bfast :,3,2016,01,26
249,Fire alarm in the middle of the night,"The hotel facilities were very good especially the pool, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The fire alarm went off a few times around 3am due to someone thinking this would be hilarious after their night out, It WASN'T at all funny trying to reassure children that there isn't a fire in the middle of the night. This was not the hotels fault but it did ruin our planned relaxing stay.",3,2016,01,26
249,Disappointed,"Stains on bed, and fire alarm went off 3 times during the night, very strong smell through hotel of cigarette smoke! was looking forward to a full nights sleep as we have 2 children it was meant to be a break! Very dissatisfied.. Not even a discount was applied!! due to the fact we had paid over 100 euro for our stay and didn't get a decent nights sleep! We could of stayed at home for free and slept better... ",3,2016,01,26
249,Great service,"Welcoming at reception was excellent, room service very good! Didn't sleep great as did not find pillows comfortable! Room lovely and warm! Pool facilities very good! Breakfast excellent as well as the service",4,2016,01,26
249,Excellent hotel for the business traveler,"Good quality, well priced, business hotel. Location is a bit far from the city center . The bus stop will have to go some distance. The apparent advantage of a large shopping center and a cinema nearby.",4,2016,01,26
249,Great Hotel - Great Location for Shopping,Stayed one night in this hotel on the 14th Jan 2016.  For the rate we got (€67  on costcutterbreaks.ie) - it was the best value hotel I have ever stayed in. - Room was great - staff were great - Leisure facilities were great and its right beside a massive shopping centre - Really enjoyed the overall experience and would highly recommend this hotel for family or business trips.,5,2016,01,25
249,family outing,relaxing stay. matress un comfortable. i would like free parking..good service helpfull staff. good location. i would recommend this hotle to my family and friends.the facilities were of a high standard as welll as the staff.,5,2016,01,25
249,perfect for business,"Great  for a business  stay , and  easy to relax in the evening  with the guy and spa  ,  and the two restaurants  offered  up  very  good quality of food  with  a v good choice......helpfull and  friendly  staff   also ,,,",4,2016,01,25
249,Leak in shower,There was leak from the ensuite above me and the drip woke me at 5am and called  reception and they were extreme nice but I did feel that when I checked out in am that I should have received apology from reception as I never got back to sleep ,3,2016,01,24
249,Really Good,"i stayed here on 2 seperate occasions while working close by. It was really good value for money. Each time a lovely lady took my booking and allocated nice quiet rooms as i had an early start each morning. Was always late evening by the time I arrived at the hotel so i had room service, beautiful food pipping hot and not too steep! Should i ever have reason to be in the area again i would have no hesitation staying again...hopefully for longer next time.",4,2016,01,24
249,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here a few times and each visit was great. Lovely big, modern and clean rooms. We had been travelling all day and it was welcoming to get into a nice warm room with a superb shower to wash the grime away. Bed was very comfortable and I had a great night's sleep.

Great fitness centre that is free to guests.

The location is also perfect if you want to do some shopping. In Dec we were coming back from a visit to the UK and stayed at the Clarion. Got up at a reasonable hour and within 5 minutes we were in one of Dublin's biggest shopping centres. Did all of our shopping without having to spend hours looking for a parking space.

It is only 15 minutes from the airport.",5,2016,01,23
249,Fab hotel,"We stayed here    And I could not speak more highly about this hotel 
Staff /room / food / And value couldn't be faulted All I say keep up the good work as you are doing a fab job . Well done to one & all . ",5,2016,01,23
249,Excellent hotel for the business traveler.,"Good quality, well priced, business hotel. Location not good if you have come for a holiday in Dublin. Long way out from the city center with poor public transport links. This however is not the hotels fault.",5,2016,01,22
249,Restful,"Service good, quality of sleep very good. Room has everything one needs including hair dryer and ironing board. Food not so good with not enough choice in traditional food especially for someone who like me has to follow a diet.",4,2016,01,21
249,Won't go again,"Stayed one night after a long day's travelling and a long flight, because of it proximity to the motorways. Arrived at the hotel about 2-30am. There was no particular welcome, maybe the night person was tired. He did not have particularly good English and said that he was new to the job. It took a half hour to get checked in, which meant we did not get to the room until 3am. The room was like any other hotel room, but quite cold. We were tired so straight to bed and sleep.
The following morning, we were woken by persistent knocking from the cleaning staff at about 10-30 am. We asked that the room not be made up until we were ready, checkout was midday. The cleaning staff stayed outside the door, making a lot of noise until we left. When showering, there was only one bath towel and one hand towel, not really enough for two people but we made do.
At check out, we informed the person on reception that the room was cold. She snidely said we should have said that to the night porter. I pointed out that we did not get to room until 3am and that being tired it had not occurred to us. She simply shrugged her shoulders. I also informed her of the lack of towels. She said there should have been extra towels in the room. I said, if there were, they were not visible to us. Again the reception person did not care. We paid and left. The hotel charges for overnight parking.
I do not think that will use this hotel again, even though it is convenient to the motorways",4,2016,01,20
249,good hotel,"very nice location,big hotel and superb facilities'Fun can be in one place,just adjacent to city and not much traffic,easy to locate,spacious parking,good nightlife,friendly staff and clean faciliites",4,2016,01,20
249,Superb!,My wife and I had stayed at the Clarion Hotel for a nights bed and breakfast. We noticed on our way in there are resurants and a shopping centre right beside the hotel. I have to say from the moment we arrived we were made welcome. The staff were very polite and helpful. After checking in we went to our room. The room itself was quite well laid out. The room had a fridge which is always handy. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. We were told at check in of the dining options and decided to go for the Italian restaurant on site. The food was amazing and the staff again were very helpful.  I had noticed when we went back to the room there was a room service menu from both resurants on site. There is only a euro difference in eating the pizza in the restaurant and having it delivered to your room. A lot of other hotels charge €5-€8 service charge per person. The next morning we got up to go for breakfast. The breakfast was a help yourself full Irish breakfast. It was lovely. After breakfast we asked at reception about a late checkout as the room was so comfortable. Checkout was meant to be at 12 o'clock.  We were told that we could have until 2 o'clock for no extra cost. This was another surprise as a lot of hotels charge for late checkout. On our departure we stopped off with family in Dublin and then headed home. On our way through Dublin my wife noticed that she didn't have her wedding and engagement rings and that she had left them in the hotel. We immediately made contact with the hotel to be told that the reception will get in contact with the accommodation staff. We got a call back to say that the two rings were handed in. We went to the hotel and collected the rings and left a tip. We are very thankful to all the staff at the Clarion Hotel. They are a credit to the hotel itself. We will defiantly be back again as we are going to take the kids for a weekend in March. Thank you very much for a very pleasant and enjoyable stay.,5,2016,01,20
249,Family get together,Great place to stay. Reasonably priced.  Excellent pool area and extremely child friendly.  The food was so tasty in the Asian restaurant.  A little slow on reception check in as there was big queues maybe extra staff needed to help out at busy times. But staff were friendly and helpful. ,5,2016,01,20
249,Price and value,Excellent value for the price.  Staff was pleasant and accommodating.  Food in the restaurant was excellent.  Rooms were clean and well equipped.  Could have used at least 2 towels in a room that has 2 beds. ,5,2016,01,20
249,Great value stay and lovely Italian restaurant,"Had a lovely 2 night stay, great food in the Italian restaurant with pizza oven and checked decor.

249,great for mini break,dont be put off because it is not in centre of Dublin taxis are frequent and its a short drive away its also close to the shopping centre and has all the facilities you need for a nice mini break the breakfast really fills you up and its good food.,4,2016,01,19
249,Excellent stay,"My fourth time staying here and staying again this weekend,easy access to M50 ,great rooms ,always sleep well here,underground parking so handy ,staff very helpfull ,excellent value,usually request room furthest from reception as very quiet and still not that far ,express checkout facility great if you need ",5,2016,01,19
249,Enjoyed the stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel but we were disappointed that there has been an added charge of €6 for the hotel car park even to guests,as the first time we stayed there the car park was free. Also the restaurants in the hotel are lovely but the food variety for dinner is limited but lovely restaurants in liffey valley shopping centre just across from the hotel.",5,2016,01,19
249,great mid week value,"all round great place to stay, great location and staff were helpful and friendly!
Gym was up to scratch with good selection of equipment and nice pool facilities. food was tasty though 3.50 for a coffee was a bit cheeky. ",4,2016,01,18

249,Fine,"This hotel is just an ok budget hotel. Rooms OK,  bed a bit hard & uncomfortable but not too bad. Breakfast is decent but no option to have it in your room. Room service menu is fairly limited & expensive. The bedside light wouldn't turn off & we had to get someone from maintenance to come & sort it out. The family room is miles from reception especially with bags & small kids. However the food in kudos was really nice.  ",3,2016,01,17
249,Wouldn't recommend this hotel,Attempted to overcharge for room. Room a long way from reception when carrying heavy bags. Noisy . Mediocre breakfast. Price for breakfast higher than that on booking site. Would not recommend this hotel.,1,2016,01,16
249,We love your hotel,"We've stayed at your hotel 3 times. Each time we have enjoyed the facilities. The food is good, the rooms are clean and modern and it is convenient to stay there the night before flying out of Dublin Airport.We have decided to that next time we come to Ireland, we will stay here 2 or 3 nights when we arrive as well. We love your hotel.",5,2016,01,14
249,"Good hotel ,average services",We stayed here for just 1 night on the new year eve. The hotel was so busy and crowded. Our luggages sent by porterage services which unfortunately sent to wrong room so We have to checked again to reception which was so busy and need time to find the luggages. Breakfast average with not so many choices.......I don't know maybe we just checked in on the wrong time......,3,2016,01,14
249,Lovely welcome and free upgrade,"I really loved this hotel received a very warm welcome to the hotel. The reception staff upgraded is to a one room apartment as we had essentially 2 babies this was perfect for us we were delighted. It only had one downside for me, as it was Sooo busy at the hotel it was a little wait for breakfast we had to que outside the dinning area. But we got free late checkout for the delay so we could use the pool and shower in our room afterwards. I would definatly back and definatly recommend.",5,2016,01,14
249,Lovely stay,Hotel was lovely and warm. Rooms were huge and v clean. Children were very welcome. Relaxed atmosphere. All in all lovely hotel. Super service for bar food and food was delicious :) staff were all very pleasant and helpful,5,2016,01,13
249,A good place for meeting,No restaurant open had to go to local restaurant it was a shame as the bistro that was open was not that comfortable to eat in hence we went out everything else about the hotel was very good I would suggest the hotel aims to think about opening the restaurant at night as its a pity to have to leave,4,2016,01,13
249,By Sarah Jan 12 2016,very good location.the welcome was super.staff in every area very professional.the room was large and comfortable.this was our first visit and we will be coming back.the vending machines are a terrible temption with children.thank you for a lovely short break.,5,2016,01,12
249,Anniversary Break,"Excellent staff. Great food in Gustos restaurant and a free upgrade to the penthouse suite when the hotel found out this was out anniversary. 
We are regular visitors to the hotel over the years and this was one of the best stays yet. Thank you.",4,2016,01,12
249,Just ok but saved by a waiter!,"Stayed here for two nights between Christmas and New Year.  At check-in I was quizzed about my booking and asked for evidence that I had booked my child as the information from Booking.com was incorrect (even-though it was for a family room).  On the first night we discovered there was a wedding reception on the first floor which meant the hotel was very busy.  This lead to very slow service in the restaurant, noise on the corridors when we were trying to sleep and chaos at breakfast as the staff struggled to cope with the number of people!!  Second night the hotel was much quieter and the service was way better.  Ate in the bar area and the waiter couldn't have done more, in fact he totally changed my opinion of the whole stay.  He was chatty, attentive and courteous and couldn't have done more.  
I wont be rushing back as the car-parking charges (not disclosed at booking) made it more expensive than rival hotels closer to Dublin centre.  The staff work very hard and could do with more assistance at busy periods.  Rooms were nice and very clean.  Overall it was fine.",3,2016,01,12
249,"elaine , germany","Stayed here a few times and i will return again. its great value for money.convenient to the N4, M50, Airport and of course shopping in liffey valley. We stayed in a family room before but thought it was a bit small and there was no microwave. This time we tried the executive suite, 1 bedroom with separate decent sized living-kitchenette. perfect for me, my mam and 2 toddlers. we had a microwave which was great for feeding fussy little ones and also had private running around space. We werent able to book that type of room on the internet as it doesnt give you that option when you say you are a family. we had to call the hotel directly to book it. looking forward to our next stay in a few months.",5,2016,01,12
249,Excellent service from friendly staff.,Excellent service from friendly staff from check in to dinner and breakfast in the morning. Dinner in the Gusto restaurant was gorgeous. A great choice on the menu and quick and friendly service. Only disappointment is having to pay for parking in the hotels own carpark!!,5,2016,01,12
249,Good hotel good location,I've stayed in this hotel a few times and it's a lovely hotel. I stayed this time with my elderly parents and I should have asked for a room near reception as the walk to room was too far. Also 2 guys decided to have an argument outside my room at 3am which meant I couldn't sleep. Don't suppose that's the hotels fault just people being inconsiderate. ,4,2016,01,12
249,Excellent lication,Excellent hotel second time to stay here had problem with toilet in room isn't notice it till morning of check out informed girl at reception very understanding and gave us complementary parking very nice ,5,2016,01,11
249,Decent value,"The hotel is nice, the rooms are comfortable and clean, however it is quite far from the city centre. I would not recommend this to anyone who does not have access to a vehicle, or who is okay with taking lots of taxis. The staff are not entirely friendly and the common areas are a bit run down, but the rooms themselves are fine for the value paid.",3,2016,01,09
249,Good place to stay,"My partner and I are repeat customers of this hotel as it is in very convenient location for us. The rooms are comfy and the staff are always friendly. 
There are two things I wish to point out however, firstly we ordered a double room... We got two singles pushed together! I know a lot of hotels do this but it really irks me. You always feel the joining and it is not comfortable :-( 
The second is there is a charge for parking, again it is only a small amount but I don't think it is warranted for the location. ",4,2016,01,07
249,Lovely stay,"Staff at reception were just a little bit unfriendly apart from that everything was perfect, rooms were clean and fresh had a little bit of trouble getting the lift to go to ground floor for breakfast but overall no real complaints ",4,2016,01,07

249,Probably wouldnt stay again.,"Tragic, bed like a brick, two very snotty barmen, terrible service at breakfast waited 20minutes for milk for my coffee, which was then cold, probably would not return, I did not feel welcome at this hotel.",3,2016,01,06
249,Óstán deas compordach,"Bhíomar an-shásta leis an ""Clarion i nGleanntán na Life"" . Bhí an t-óstán deas glan compordach. Bhí an fhoireann oibre an-dheas agus cairdiúil agus cabhraitheach agus foighneach i gcónaí.....na daoine ag an bhFáiltiú, sa bhialann, sa bheár, san ionad scíthe agus, fiú, sna pasáistí/seomraí codlata.

249,Very Pleased.,"Very enjoyable stay. I was please because as a family it was very suitable. The location is so good, It is near the M50, shops and cinema, and only a short drive from the city centre. The food was lovely and also the leisure facilities were very good.",5,2016,01,06
249,family friendly hotel,lovely hotel. staff very friendly especially in Italian restaurant. Bar service a little slow. Rooms were lovely and very warm and clean.

249,poor service,"Barman was very rude to our family he was abrupt. He spoke to us in a awful manner telling us to ""get our children out of the bar NOW"" we were on the understanding it was a child friendly hotel and didn't realize children weren't allowed in the bar after a certain time but to be spoke to in that manner was out of order",3,2016,01,05
249,Enjoyed my stay,"Stayed here with my family there was some good offers on also the food was good only problem was young kids running mad up and down the halls to all hours over New Year's Eve while the parents stayed in the bar made a complaint but no 1 seemed to bother much about it,other than that I will stay here again",5,2016,01,05
249,Great,"Good for value, great for family , location is far away from city center, however very convenient to M50, so it's good for somebody with a car. Kids love the pool and they insisted to come back here next time",4,2016,01,05
249,Comfortable stay for New Year's Eve,"Very nice hotel, children-friendly, great spa facilities. very friendly staff, efficient housekeeping. The rooms could be a bit better maintained, mainly the bathroom, but overall we had a great stay over New year's Eve. taxi cost to Dublin city centre is around 20-25 euro, cost to the airport is around 30-35 euro, on tariff 1.",4,2016,01,05
249,Great spot,"Third stay here, everything top notch as usual. Came to do some shopping and relax. Hotel was clean and comfy and the staff were friendly and efficient.

249,new years day stay over,"as a family of 5, we have often stayed here before, and enjoyed it. This time was the worst ever, the selection of food for dinner on our arrival in bad weather was very poor, if you didnt like italian then you wouldnt eat. There was noise all night til after 3am with young children running up and down the halls screaming and shouting, with no heed being passed by night porter or their parents, resulted in barely any sleep, and then woke in the morning by hoovers outside our door. The desk at checkout was not adequately manned with over a half an hour wait, with only one staff member on duty, who was nt very sympathetic to our situation from the previous night. Just said if i wanted to lodge a complaint id have to wait to speak to the manager, i informed her i couldnt wait any longer as we were already late leaving , Overall very disappointed with the hotel, has gone down in my opinion and my husband who travels all over the world for his work. wont be coming back again. will look elsewhere.",2,2016,01,04
249,Lovely weekend shopping break,"I stayed here with 2 friends for 2 nights to do our Christmas shopping. Liffey Valley is a short walk away and Blanchardstown and Ikea were only a few minutes drive.
The hotel was lovely. Our triple room had a double and 2 singles and plenty of space for the 3 of us.  Tea and coffe making facilities were in the room which is always welcome.
Breakfast was delicious, a good selection, although quite busy.
We had lunch in the bar area which was very tasty and drinks in the bar one night, cocktails were lovely.
There is a charge for car parking.
we also ate in the restaurant one night which we enjoyed. ",5,2016,01,04
249,You pay for what you get.,Staff are very friendly and helpful. Food is over priced and disgusting. Cleaning service is very slow our room didn't get clean on the first night and on the second they didn't come around until 7 and at that stage our baby was asleep so we couldn't let them in. ,3,2016,01,04
249,my review,"Nice hotel 
children freely 
good food 
just need more chairs and tables to accomadate the number of pleople staying 
nice staff nice food 
I stayed new years eve children where going around the halls all hours of thr nite found it hard to put baby to sleep
Room was fine had a lovely stay would stay in it again.",4,2016,01,04
249,Best hotel for families in Dublin,"We stayed here from New Year's Eve until this afternoon.  There were a lot of people at the hotel owing to the time of year, and there was a wedding party.  This only added to the ambience as it's a very friendly, relaxed, unstuffy hotel, yet clean, efficient and of excellent quality and value for money.  

We ate in Kudos restaurant, the bar and Gusto restaurant.  We were a party of six with varying nationalities, as well as visitors coming to visit us there from the Dublin area.  All were happy with the quality and quantity of the food, and the level of service.  The waitresses we had at Kudos and Gusto were wonderfully friendly, and very informed about the menu.  In fact we found everyone and everything to be top notch, and would find it difficult to find fault with anything.  

The room was clean, comfortable and had everything you would need for a break away.  The wifi was free and worked fine.  There was a free safe in the room, as well as tea/coffee making facilities, fridge, hairdryer, iron and ironing board.  Toiletries are supplied in the bathroom - with aragon oil.  We also used the pool - excellent facilities (sauna/steam room/ jacuzzi/kiddy pool; towels supplied, shower gel in the showers) and reception service was very efficient.  There is a kids area (indoors and outdoors), as well as a teen zone.  All facilities were used by our kids and they loved it.

Although we have family nearby, my kids always ask that we stay at the Clarion whenever we visit Dublin. So, we'll keep returning and would highly recommend it to anyone with families, or those who enjoy being in a family atmosphere. There are occasionally queues to the reception and breakfast area, but they move quickly.  The reception staff explained the facilities to us on arrival, and asked if we enjoyed our stay on leaving.  We feel very much at home at the Clarion.  

Many thanks to all the staff for a fantastic stay! In particular to the lovely waitress in Kudos who very kindly managed to keep the kitchen open for us when we arrived back from a day out last night after 10pm and ensured we got something hot to eat.  Much appreciated.",5,2016,01,04
249,Comfortable stay,"We had a great time over all, but felt the bar area for food was very untidy and not enough spaces, I would return but not for a new year event, the breakfast was quite basic and felt I had to ask at least 2 people about gluten free bread, they didn't seem to know what I was talking about, but it soon got sorted, ",4,2016,01,04
249,weekend stay,"good hotel rooms nice, however  do not face motorway side as can be noisy if window needs to be open to cool room. A little on the expensive side at 160 euro for the night compared to staying in airport hotels",4,2016,01,04
249,New Year's Eve stay with couple and kids,Excellent stay staff our friendly lots to do for kids they loved the disco highly recommend looking forward to next year already thanks for great night kids already want to go back they made lots of little friends ,5,2016,01,04
249,New years eve,"Stayed here for 1 night with my husband and 2 children, dinner was hectic not enough seats, standing around waiting for people to finish grab seats, kids disco €5 they enjoyed it, Dj on until about 12.30, good night for family's with young children ",3,2016,01,04
249,Night in Liffey Valley,"Big Hotel, very busy. Good check in , room was very good, clean.  Bed wasn't most comfortable- two singles but together. Was a con-joined room so could hear music and chat from next door till 4am, low level but enough to disrupt sleep. Gastro restaurant was quick, tasty and cheap. Fine for a night near to Dublin, good breakfast was extra. Parking also an extra. free Wi-Fi.",3,2016,01,04
249,Good value,"Good location, good value. Very busy hotel and felt like a number rather than a guest. No areas to sit and relax in evening, bar was too busy & groups were very loud and messy. Room was nice, Rituals cosmetics was a nice touch, bed was too hard.
",3,2016,01,04
249,New Years Eve,"Nice hotel, nice staff, didn't experience the food, room nice and clean.  No breakfast served to room.

249,Sorry we stayed there,"From the minute we went to check in we were just a number,all they wanted was your money,bar food not great beds so not comfy,wifi worked when it wanted to.pool was brill,you have to pay €5 each nite for your car,over all not worth the money we paid and I would not recommend hotel.even to checking out we were not asked once did we enjoy are stay she barley made eye contact.",1,2016,01,03
249,Relaxing stop over to end our holiday,"This was not relaxing. Whilst the hotel its self was lovely and the staff very friendly, we had the worst night sleep due to hearing guests in adjoining rooms and a car alarm. We then tried to order room service for breakfast however there was no answer when we called. We were then met with a Huge queue for breakfast. We were able to grab something to take to the room (therefore bypassing the queue).
When we complained about the previous night sleep, we were asked if we had spoken to reception and requested a different room; given that this happened in the middle of the night we hadn't done this as gathering our belongings and moving at that time was not considered.",3,2016,01,03
249,Attending a wedding at the Clarion Hotel,"Had a great stay at the hotel staff were lovely, the food was amazing, the hotel was so nice ,the overall stay there for me and my family was 100% I would recommend this hotel for a great family stay 😊",5,2016,01,03
249,Not Impressed,"We we suppose to stay for four nights but cut it to one, a bit dramatic yes but as a seasoned travellor i dont waste time. 

Reception was very busy when we arrived had to wait as only one person at the desk. Even though it was my first time there i was given very little information. Not even where the lifts to the rooms where, and it is not obvious. 

Unbeknown to us that is the heating is turned of at 9pm centrally. I thought our radiator was broken and froze the night away in addition to a terrible draft from the window. When i went down the next morning the response was i should have called and they could turn it on. What was in my room upon return from breakfast was 2 electric heaters.

Thing to note, only sandwiches offered after 10pm, which of course i arrived at 21.55 :) that is no warm room service.

Breakfast was good, decent selection. Staff were friendly and very efficient in the restaurant.

Room was basic and clean, it is a big hotel so ask to be reasonably near the lifts or your in for a trek.

Now not sure if this was an oversight on booking.com, or the hotel or the fact i didnt see it. But there is mention of plenty of parking, but i didnt see mention of it being paid, which of course it was...

WiFi was good and Free.",2,2016,01,02

249,Clarion visit ,"Staying in the clarion with my boyfriend. First arrived it was very busy with children running around everywhere. Checked in and got to our room to realise the key didn't work. Went back to reception and the staff kindly apologised and fixed the key. Only to return to the room to find someone else had already checked into that room. 2nd trip back to reception, after about 20 mins finally got another room. The staff were very helpful with the situation. Very nice rooms. Wouldn't recommend it to couples for a quiet break away. Would recommend it to any family. Very family friendly. ",3,2016,01,02
249,Good family friendly hotel but receptionist misinformed us.,"Over all good hotel with very good facilities. But receptionist on arrival told us that we have two morning breakfast included in the package but on second morning, lady at the restaurant told us that we don't have that  morning breakfast included. I told her that I had been told by the receptionist on arrival that breakfast is included . So she said she will check that and we went on to have our breakfast. At checkout we were charged for the breakfast which was unacceptable. The communication or information error was by receptionist and we paid the price. Very unprofessional at this level of service.

We had connecting rooms and one room wifi didn't work at all. 

After cleaning the toilets no shower gel was put and we have request it. Seems u professing even hotel didn't seem full in view of storm frank. ",4,2016,01,02

249,"friendly staff, but loud environment","We booked a room at the Clarion on an overnight layover from London the States. We explored for the evening in Howth and then took the train from Howth to Dublin, transferred to the bus in Dublin and rode our to Liffey Valley. Be aware that the bus stop is a walk from the hotel. We were not expected the walk we ended up having to make at midnight with our luggage. Once we entered the hotel the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ended up in a handicap accessible room, which had a shower that caused some minor water leakage issues (due to user error). The hotel also had a children's night club as well as a nightclub or gambling parlor of some sort next door. When we were trying to sleep the music was very loud. It did not bother us too much, but if you are a light sleeper I imagine that it would be difficult to drift off with the noise level. We ended up getting a cab straight from the hotel to the airport without a very long drive.",3,2015,12,27

249,Friendly Relaxing Hotel,Stayed here for a Christmas shopping trip with my 80yr old mother and two young granddaughters and we had a lovely stay. The staff were excellent from the girl on reception to the young guy in the bar. The queue for breakfast was extremely long but the staff coped brilliantly. The only thing we would have liked was a better choice on the menu for bar food. Even with the diverse age range in our group we all enjoyed our stay and will return.,5,2015,12,16
249,Wonderful hotel,"Love this hotel and must give a huge shout out to the fabulous receptionist Martina who checked us in on arrival. She was absolutely lovely and so pleasant, friendly and helpful! Very impressed with the hotel and will definitely stay again.",5,2015,12,16

249,family stay,"Everybody enjoyed their stay. 
All staff efficient and friendly.
Large and extensive breakfast buffet available although it could have been hotter.

249,Lovely Hotel,"we had a one night stay, the room was lovely, loved the shower, only complaint was the breakfast was a bit cold although the quality was good so that was a bit disappointing, having said that overall it was a good experience and would stay again ",4,2015,12,15
249,2 for 2,This was my second stay at this hotel this year & once again everything was perfect.Only downside was the pool was closed for renovations.Other than that I can't fault the place.We dined in Kudos bar were I bumped into Robert who served us on a previous stay & once again was chatty & remembered our last encounter.Which if you ask me is the mark of a great bar man.We will definitley be back,5,2015,12,14
249,You need lots of patience for this hotel... Lots of waiting around. ,"I stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend recently. (Sat to Monday) We both were extremely dissapointed with the quality of the service. When we first arrived at 14.50 we were told we had to wait 40 minutes to check in as our room wasn't ready. (We were told in an e-mail that check in was from 15.00) The receptionist was rude and she actually had to ring someone to tell them to clean our room. Which I think is ridiculous and have never experienced before! Then she told us that we had to pay the remaining amount of our stay, which is perfectly ok, only that there was fifty euro added onto this total with no explanation why.  I asked her what that was and she told me it was a deposit. I wasn't notified of this previously, or on arrival, which I find very rude. I found it very strange paying a deposit for a room that wasn't even ready!!! 
So anyway, I paid the total including the deposit and we waited an hour for our room. No one came over to tell us it was ready, or even apologised about the delay. It wasn't just us that had to wait, there were several other parties that were waiting, many with young children. 
We finally got into the room, and it was nice and clean; no complaints there! 
Breakfast is between 6am and 11am on a Saturday so we went down at 9.30am so we could get the day started early! When we came out of the lift we were met with a huge queue. At first we didn't realise what this queue was for, so walked past it! It was leading to the dining area, this massive queue was for breakfast. Another first for me. I have stayed in many hotels and have never had to queue for breakfast. I asked the same receptionist as the previous day roughly how long the queue would take. I was answered with  'I Dont know.' Eventually she said it would take twenty minutes. So we waited for half an hour and only moved slightly so gave up and left and bought breakfast somewhere else. We paid for breakfast in this hotel, yet had to go elsewhere for it as they couldn't deal with the amount of people. This is unprofessional. We were talking to a couple later on and they waited an hour and a half for breakfast. Imagine how long the people who arrived down at 11 had to wait!!  Also just to point out the majority of the people in the queue were families with young children and pushchairs. For them to have to wait and entertain their children for that length is disgraceful, and yet again there was no apologies from any staff member. We might as well have been invisible. 
On the second morning we went down earlier to avoid the ridiculous queue. We were seated straight away. It is self serve so I don't understand what the delay was previously. It was only a satisfactory breakfast. My boyfriend would eat literally anything, he is a dustbin and always finishes my meals when I can't!!! He couldn't eat any of the breakfast. The eggs were like rubber and the sausages aren't nice. They did  have a good selection of fruit, cereal and croissants, so there were alternative options. 
We proceeded to check out then and as we live a good distance away we wanted to get away early. There was no queue for a change, so handed in our room keys. The receptionist was a different one that previous and she was pleasant and friendly. I had my card ready as I assumed they would put the deposit back onto my card. She then proceeded to tell me that we would have to wait for someone to come down and give us the fifty euro back. Another first for us!!  So after a half an hour they gave it us back. They obviously had to check the room before they returned it. There were quite a few others waiting also. And I could tell they were mad too!! If you were in a hurry or catching a train or a plane it would be very inconvenient. 
Overall we wouldn't stay here again and would put us off staying in any Clarion. Also I have learnt that a family member of mine also stayed here and found it unsatisfactory also. I wish I knew about this before I booked it!! 
There was not one apology for any of the lengthy waiting and one receptionist inparticular was always rude and approachable. This is unacceptable and disappointing. 
One more thing. There was no menu for room service or anything on our room, but a leaflet stating that it was open 24 hours a day. How could you order with no menu?? We rang and the man told us pizza had finished, if we knew there was pizza we would have ordered it earlier. He put together some chips and chicken gougons! He was nice and even gave us extra and gave it us for cheaper too!!! 
Hope this was helpful and sorry about the length of it. Needed a bit of a rant! ",1,2015,12,14

249,Amazing,Our regular hotel for a break with or without the kids. Staff are so warm and welcoming. The rooms are top notch. Great for families and staff are very accommodating for parents and kids. Breakfast is lovely every time I have been. It's great having a huge shopping centre so close with restaurants and cafes. Also the cinema I found a little bit more expensive than others in Dublin but so handy for something to do. ,5,2015,12,13
249,Our recent stay,"We recently stayed at the Clarion at Liffey Valley.  My daughter was flying in from UK on a late flight for an early morning interview and while our stay was a short one and for a specific purpose , it was very pleasant and convenient for the airport.",4,2015,12,13

249,review of clarion liffey valley,"Good, pity pool was closed and we weren't told when booking, we only booked here because of the pool. We would def have booked elsewhere if we knew pool was closed. We were given passes for the NAC which was very nice but when we got there a lot of their facilities were closed as well. Prob bad time of year to be going away!

249,Enjoyable family break,Had a very nice stay at your hotel and staff were friendly and helpful only down side was the pool was closed for maintanence but they did look after us. Breakfast was very nice and you had a good choice available,4,2015,12,08
249,Disappointing experience,Be prepared for drunken rowdy behavior. Avoid if you have young children around Christmas period. Family room was tiny no room for buggies and other things required by young children. Got no sleep because of drunken behavior. Left Sunday tiredand aannoyed,3,2015,12,08
249,Excellent hotel,Great hotel however disappointed due to the timing of renovation work being carried out to the swimming pool.  Wasnt handy for us to use the alternative option as we have a 8 month old baby and 8 yr old. Also the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Not alot of space for it to be a superior family room. Overall the hotel is great just a couple of points that we wanted to make. We plan to visit again Christmas 2016. ,4,2015,12,08
249,Christmas break,I stayed here as I had stayed before. Lovely hotel good value for money. The only down side wS the bed they really need to be updated they are sagging in the middle. Did have an issue with our first room and it was fixed very efficiently ,5,2015,12,08

249,Very disappointing,Never told me at time of booking that a 50 euro deposit was needed checking in. The staff was very unhelpful when I told them I hadn't enough on my card to pay this the room we got was very cold had to change rooms and even at that it wasn't that warm. the food in the place was very overpriced. When it came to checking out I was told I had to pay for my car that I parked for the weekend. For the price we paid for the 2 nights I was very let down by this hotel and wouldn't stay again ,2,2015,12,07
249,Excellent,We were upgraded from family room to penthouse apartment at no extra cost. Magic. It was just brilliant. So much space. Such comfort. We have stayed here many times but we're never given an upgrade before. ,5,2015,12,07
249,fawlty towers would have been better,had three twin rooms booked was told i could be upgraded to a penthouse happy days as it was myself and two girlfriends one who is heavily pregnant only to arrive at 12.30 to find it was an apartment in another building and it was filthy rang ask to be moved spent 2 hrs trapising around the hotel to get another room finaly got a two bed suite not what we asked for but all they had anyway that was also filthy pubic hairs on the sheets leftover food in the fridge and the couch needs to be in a skip at 5.30 we still didnt have a room so we decided to leave and go shoping and told chris the manager that the room bettter be cleaned properly when we came back overall a disaster as we were only staying one night and didnt get much shoping done with the upset of the whole day,1,2015,12,07
249,Don't book it !,"I have just returned for an over night stay. Where do I start. Booked on booking.com.  Swimming pool closed for maintenance this was not mentioned when booking. We got to reception and we were told that the restaurant was closed all day. We got to the room and it stank of smoke we couldn't open the windows as there was a busy motorway which wax very noisy. Pillows lumpy and bed was hard however at least yhe room was clean. Stayed the night as we had booked to go and see santa in palmerstown. The breakfast just a disaster we had to queue for 15 mins for a table for a breakfast which was totally unedible it was swimming in grease, no tea or coffee after asked 3 members of staff. Raw bacon, cheap gristley sausages just gross. When we checked out we were charged an extra 11 euro from are confirmation booking.com email. The management made a febble excuse about same and wouldnt give the money back. The worse hotel and staff I have experienced in a long time. Book somewhere else. Hope this helps.",1,2015,12,06

249,Friendly staff,We stayed over the weekend as we were visiting family and I think this was the main hotel in the area.  We stayed in a superior room which was comfortable and clean and the cooked breakfast was great.. However the central heating did not work properly so the room was quite cold (we reported this when checking out).  Also found sound insulation not great (could hear next door having a shower at 4 in the morning).  ,3,2015,12,02
249,Very nice hotel,"Good hotel and very close to Liffey Valley Shopping Center.

We had a family weekend booked.  

WiFI is just top notch..3 devices streaming video no issues

Bunk Beds were a problem.  The bottom ladder for top bunk was obscured by the bedside locker.  Child had to climb onto locker to access ladder to get up.  Not ideal at all.  

Staff in Gusto Restaurant were wonderful and catered for my son, who is a ceoliac, just fine.

Room decor and general hotel decor was good and fresh.

All in all were would, and probably will, use the hotel again...

Can't say enough how good the WiFi was :D",4,2015,12,01

249,Average,"Stayed for one night,first impressions of hotel were positive,nice warm lobby on a cold Saturday afternoon. On presenting my prepaid hotel voucher was asked for a credit card or €50'cash for room incidentals, which I explained I had neither and would it be ok until my wife arrived around an hour later which was quickly denied. So I had no access to my prepaid room.kicked up a bit of a stink and they eventually relented,all this could have been avoided with a bit of common sense from reception staff.rooms nice,decent enough bar with good barman who seemed to know what they were at (a rarity in a hotel nowadays). Swimming pool out of service which was a pain as was looking forward to a dip.breakfast was nice with good choice.be warned not free parking for residents which is a disgrace.€5 overnight charge.€10 for us a we arrived in different vehicles.never been charged for hotel parking before.all in all average stay,would not recommend to highly and would not stay again",3,2015,11,30

249,Horrible Filthy excuse for a hotel,"It had been a long flight and we were checked into the room. Staff were polite. Laid down on the bed and it felt like a cane had been made up into the bed investigated and found it was two beds zipped together, we requested a different room and were put into a filthy room that looked like someone had had a brawl in it the curtains had holes and were dirty it smelled musty and moldy. next day woke up and went to breakfast grabbed a plate and there was a used butter foil and egg on the plate went down 4 plates to find a clean one handed them to the waiter who didn't even seem surprised to see the dirty plates. Went back to the room to figure out when it would get cleaned and were curious why I was so congested. We checked the mattress and after seeing how dirty it was we called and booked into another hotel. We were in two different rooms and both were dirty.  The furniture was beat up there was mold and mildew in the window ledges and the staff were oblivious to the lack of cleanliness. Despite the no smoking policy, the hotel smell of stale cigarette smoke.  If you must stay here bring cleaning supplies.",1,2015,11,28
249,great stay as usual,stayed here many times and as usual it was up to its high standard.   unfortunately on this occasion we had some very noisy neighbours during the night so didn't get a great sleep but appreciate that this is not the hotels fault.

249,Lovely hotel,"We came to stay here on 19/11/15 for a 4 night stay, I am on my 3rd night so far and it has been a lovely stay. It is comfy ,cosy and we felt welcome as soon as we got here. I would have given 5 but there were a few things that let it down though they are minor things, but staying in places like Crowne Plaza where it is impeccable and flawless has stopped me from doing that.

Pros;
Clean an comfortable, lovely bed and we had everything we needed, rooms were cleaned everyday
 Good wifi 
Good location 
Good staff

Cons;

The cleanliness was abit iffy. The toilet was stained when we got here (the bowl) and despite having our room cleaned this kept being missed, in the end I cleaned it myself. 
When we had breakfast my cup and cutlery had marks on but they changed them no problem

The shower curtain wasnt great as water kept coming out from the side, i think a shield would be better

Breakfast is a bit expensive 27 euros for 2 people for one morning, though it was nice

I would not let this put me off as overall it is a great hotel in a good location and myself and my partner have said we would come back, but i think there might be a little more attention to detail needed.

Do not take a lower grand floor room facing inwards!  In the end the atmosphere within the hotel was so good we forgot about the view from the window. Not many hotels could have got away so lightly.,4,2015,11,17
249,very comfortable,Very comfortable clean hotel with very helpful  staff. Pool was closed due to maintenance the kids were disappointed but the receptionist and duty manager upgraded us to a suite which the kids loved. It had a lovely comfortable king size bed and a separate room for the kids. Great nights sleep we really enjoyed our stay. ,5,2015,11,17
249,We would stay here again,"We stayed here over the weekend when we were up in Dublin for a bit of Christmas shopping.  It was very convenient for Ikea and Blanchardstown shopping centre as they were only down the road.
The Guy on check in was very friendly and explained everything to us.  We went up to the Room and it was a fine size and very comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities which is always handy.
We had food in Kudos on the Saturday night.  The staff were very nice here but we were waiting nearly an hour between trying to order and actually getting our food.  The food was excellent when we got it but we thought the wait was too long.  We had two drinks after and the Two Man Band were very good and the Bar staff were very efficient.
We went down for Breakfast at 9.30am and had to queue for 30 minutes.  There was a great choice when we did get in but they need to review their breakfast facilities on a busy weekend.  Normally if you go down at this time it would be fine in other hotels, if you leave it a bit later you expect to wait for a table.  
It was quite busy because of a lot of Families staying for Disney on Ice and a Conference on there for the weekend so that may have been the reason but it didn't help us waiting to get a table.
Because of the delays in getting dinner and breakfast I am only giving the hotel an Average rating.  They should look at improving this for future busy weekends, maybe serving breakfast in the Kudos/Bar area as well.
We will stay here again but hopefully on a quieter weekend!",3,2015,11,16
249,Xmas shopping with the kids.,Pity there wasn't a better variety of food in the bar and that the pool was closed. Room was dusty. A lot of the family have asthma so this was dissapointing. When we told reception on our departure we got a €5 parking ticket validated. ,2,2015,11,16
249,Really poor,"Rude, unhelpful reception staff.
Didn't realise guests had to pay for parking and when I informed them after checkout that I had no Euros for the machine (which doesn’t take card) I was told I would have to walk in the rain to a local shop to withdraw money. It was only after I refused to do this was I told that reception could charge my credit card - such a fuss and inconvenience made for no reason. 
Breakfast was also really poor, and they didn’t even have coffee the morning I ate there.
Won’t stay there again.
",1,2015,11,16
249,Great value break ,Just back from a short stay at the Clarion hotel Liffey Valley. Ideal spot just a short distance from the shopping centre. Nice clean comfortable room. The only quibble I would have is the room was set out for two people although we had booked and paid for three people. Breakfast was excellent although we had to que for a while. Dinner in Gusto was very good. Would highly recommend it.,4,2015,11,15
249,Surburban hotel charges for car parking.,"A fine hotel, but it seems strange that overnight guests are penalised by a car parking charge in an area where parking at shopping centres etc are free. Indeed those who park at the hotel for less than 3 hours, whether or not they give the hotel bar, restaurant or gym and custom, do not pay. Very strange policy.",4,2015,11,15
249,Enjoyable stay,"We only stayed for one night in the Clarion but will definitely return. The location was brilliant, close to The Hermitage Clinic (which was the reason for our stay), close to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre & within walking distance of a bar and restaurant. I had soup in the hotel bar earlier in the day & it was the tastiest soup I'd say I ever had. Later on my husband & I walked across the road to the Lemongrass restaurant which was absolutely delicious. We found our room in the Clarion very comfortable except that we did find it cold. We mentioned this to reception at 6pm and were told the heating would be on at 7pm. She did offer a heater for the room which we declined as we were on our way out. When we returned later that night we still found the room cold. We didn't ask for a heater at that stage as it was late. In saying that all the staff we encountered whether in the bar, reception or otherwise were extremely accommodating, pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately due to our short stay, we didn't get to use the leisure facilities but hopefully will get a chance to next time. ",5,2015,11,15
249,brilliant,"A really nice hotel close to the m50 and the liffey shopping centre... bedroom are really nice. 
Staff very helpful.
Unfortunately we couldn't use the pool but the manager was very friendly and find us a solution.
I will definitely go back to this hotel for my next trip with my two kids (age 4 &5)",5,2015,11,15
249,Modern hotel near m50 and n4,"A nice modern hotel with a range of restaurants.   Near to large shopping centre.   Has a good set up for business meetings and also gym.

249,Great hotel in a great location,"I have stayed here a few times this year, really like the hotel, rooms are nice with plenty of space, breakfast is great with plenty of choices. Lots of parking available at the hotel. 5 minutes walk to shopping centre and cinema - will definitely be back before Christmas with the family.",4,2015,11,14
249,Easy location to motorway,"Easy and great location to all areas to Dublin and beyond, nice clean hotel and good food , had a problem with heat in room could not get to work , very rear as always stay at the hotel, staff are always on hand to help, the hotel looks good with the new carpets in halls.  
      ",5,2015,11,13
249,Average,"If you agree that it's people who provide the experience then you will find the Clarion average with just one or two stars shining.

Asking more than twice for things at breakfast and heaters in the room ( radiator thermo not working) and managing to get signed in and changed for a swim before discovering myself that the pool is closed till middle of December.

I was here for the week and due back for the next three.

I've cancelled and booked elsewhere.",3,2015,11,13

The bed needs a new comfortable mattress.",5,2015,11,10
249,Shopping break,Quality of room was very good and it was very easy to get back and forth to shopping centre and retail parks. I was very impressed with the quality of the gluten free food available at Gusto's. Haven't had a gluten free pizza in ages. ,4,2015,11,10
249,Comfortable hotel with good service.,"This hotel provides a pleasant environment for either a short stay, or a longer break. The easy access to Liffey Valley shopping centre is very much in its favour.Gusto's restaurant is most enjoyable. Unfortunately, the swimming pool closed for maintenance on the day we stayed there.",3,2015,11,09
249,"Perfect for our needs on the night, shame about the noise","Stayed for a night as we were attending an event in the hotel. Food in the bar was very good, I was pleasantly surprised! It is a shame that the hotel only stocked Pepsi in the function room, might seem petty, but you either love it or hate it! Also, Club tonic is not as nice as Schweppes! Why do hotels do this!!!
Noise of banging doors in the corridor woke us very early. Not the most peaceful nights sleep we have ever had!

Hotel very clean & tidy, rooms fab, swimming pool, gym etc. a bonus, great breakfast & evening meals. I could not fault this hotel & will definately be booking it in the near future.",5,2015,11,07
249,Nice place to stay,We stayed here as we were going to the 3 arena. Easy enough to catch bus in and out of Dublin city. Breakfast was really nice. The only things that would give me reason to rate only 3 is booking a double room and getting two single beds pushed together. And the light in the room very dark. Hard to get ready with very little light. Small things I know. ,3,2015,11,07
249,Clarion,"I asked for a glass of red wine in the bar, after standing there for 5 minutes it was given to me, spilled a little and I was not given a choice. I also left something small behind me in my room as was rushing to work and I phoned and also called into the hotel. It is of sentimental value, and no sign of it. Overall poor service in the bar and on room service, but the waiters and waitresses in Gusto restaurant were brilliant and very friendly. They are an asset to your hotel. ",4,2015,11,07
249,Room for improvement,"Large hotel with a lot going on. Advised front desk of an issue - hope they rectify the matter for other guests comfort. Gym well stocked wth equipment, rowing machines need some attention, but that's being picky

249,Poor,"Lots to improve. While the location is great, my stay which was for business will be my last at this hotel. Staff were friendly especially at reception however there were lots of other problems. The carpet in my room was stained and there was a sharp tack protruding out of the carpet. I was informed that breakfast could not be served to my room for health and safety reasons which seemed a pretty feeble reason when other hot meals were available on room service. Breakfast was poor and there is a charge for parking. Not a lot to entice me back!",2,2015,11,04
249,"Lovely staff, school holidays, first visit to Ireland","Two adults and one 12 year old. Room was far from reception, lights a little dusty but the rest of the room was clean. Housekeeping staff very friendly and helpful. Not enough of anything provided in the room considering there were 3 of us not 2 of us but housekeeping soon put that right. Some people had to queue for breakfast which would be really disappointing. Breakfast was okay but placed in metal trays like school dinners - but I suppose that's the only way to feed so many people. Great to be near the",4,2015,11,04

249,Great family friendly hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights over Halloween on a 2bb1d package.  The kids loved the evening discos, pool etc. Ate in both Gusto and Kudos and both meals were enjoyable. The only slight negative were that the family rooms were a bit cramped and very warm at night (a fan was provided, so this must be a regular complaint). There was no chair at desk/ dressing table. Overall a great family break and would return if price was right.",4,2015,11,03
249,autumn break,"I have only one complaint about this hotel, my car was vandalised in the car park, right outside the reception area. The duty manager had never come back to me regarding this. He was to look through the cctv for me. It put a dampner on my break. However; apart from that we had an excellent experience. Staff, rooms, food all excellent. Wee lad called Jamie and another wee lad thar served us our meal were excellent & very good with the kids. I would say leave the car at home. ",4,2015,11,03

Quality of mattresses was extremely poor and I ended up having to make a bed on the floor the second night of my stay.  No sleep for 2 nights!! Overall quality of room very poor with skirting boards hanging of the walls.  
I stayed over mid term and ended up getting no breakfast on the second day as the there was a queue of approx. 20 people with only one person attending to customers.",1,2015,11,02

Free wifi was great throughout the hotel.

Our room was over the shutter/gate for the underground carpark which was quiet annoying and disturbing when it opened at 11.30pm when we had kids asleep. It woke us again at 3.30 and 5.30 am.  I thought the underground carpark didn't open til 7am ",4,2015,11,01

249,Excellent hotel and facilties,"we stayed here for 2 nights 25th to 27th October.
before coming to Ireland i booked this hotel as it was outside the hustle and bustle of Dublin, and after asking a question on here how far from Dublin, i got told 25 minutes by bus and the bus stop is within a minutes stroll from the hotel and got told this by the duty manager over a month before visiting. RUBBISH its 20 minutes walk (not pleasant if its raining) or 25 euro one way for taxi.
i have to say tho thats the only let down for the hotel, as the rooms, facilities and cleanness is excellent.
but i have to say the location would put us off visiting again",4,2015,10,29

The location of the hotel is really convenient to motorway for trips to city and day trips for kids to Zoo, Tayto Park, etc.  Love that Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is within walking distance.

Only really issue was the 'relaxed' attitude toward customer service - reception staff were friendly and every time we visited the restaurant, we were greeted with smiles and cheer but the actual service received from waitresses/waiters was poor!  Took an age to get served and even then got the wrong food - albeit payment was forfeited for this reason - after an initial drink we were never offered another and sat around literally looking at staff who didn't respond to our needs!  On Sunday evening, we were told by the restaurant staff in the bar that food was not served after 6pm and then when we tried to order a delivery service from a local pizza provider, the reception staff would not help with contact numbers/postcode info leaving us very frustrated and hungry!!!!  
No doubt we will be visiting again due to the excellent location and overall quality of hotel accommodation but let's hope the service improves.",3,2015,10,29

249,Family trip,So I'm just going to go through some bullet points of this hotel. It's clean rooms are a good size and the food in the restaurants were nice. Things I feel let it down are charging for car parking (never experienced this before underground or otherwise) Such a hassle getting tickets paying for them before returning to your car!  Also just having the two specific restaurants advertised Asian or Italian. We sat in the Asian restaurant and didn't fancy that type of cuisine and no where does is say you offer bar food until I had ask and we had lovely club sandwich. We were there an hour and overheard people coming in saying oh it's only Asian food in here and walked out ( why you don't have the bar menu on show is beyond me you would get some much more custom). We stayed for 4 days and the sheets were not changed only repositioned and we had no dove shower gel both were empty and we only received mini shampoo etc on the last night. Lastly the breakfast was not good. We had to wait for everything. Everytime I went to get milk there was none left and they only filled it when asked and we had to wait ages. Also no fried eggs you had to ask for them which took even longer the bacon was cold and the croissants were not fresh. To top it off they charge €5 for most activities at the kids club. I have stayed in many hotels and these are always free including the kids dinner to charge for this and parking is just greedy.,3,2015,10,28
249,October 2015 stay,"The hotel, overall, is fine.  Transportation to the city center of Dublin, is not the best for the hotel Customers.  There is a long walk to public bus stop and it is around very heavy traffic highways.  Ok, but not great during daylight but I would never do it after dark.   Restaurant staff, in the Asian restaurant, very friendly and helpful.  Rooms comfortable and since it is not air conditioned, they already supplied a fan in the room.  That was nice and temperature was comfortable because they already put fan in the room.

249,Mrs. Brown in steamroom!,"We stayed for three nights weekend just gone. Booked a few weeks ago based on apparent value for money, family friendliness, swimming pool etc. Reviews that appeared after booking were mixed and at one point we thought about changing.
I am really glad that we didn't, honestly, please don't believe all you read. The odd niggle is far outweighed by the positives. 
Let's start at the beginning: we travelled late, taking advantage of a cheap late night flight. We arrived at the airport at approx. 11.30 pm and loved the well organised taxi rank. Unfortunately the road from the motorway to the hotel was closed for roadworks, resulting in a diversion and a final taxi fare of over 60 Euro, shocking.
When we finally arrived at the hotel we were warmly greeted by the check in staff who efficiently processed us and pointed us in the direction of our room. The room was very clean and contained everything we needed. However, the bed was the only negative thing about our stay, and the reason for not giving 5/5. It was clean and firm, as it should be. However, the mattress must have been around as long as the hotel (10 yrs) as it dipped horribly in the middle, causing me to brace myself when facing inwards to stop myself rolling into the middle. On all three mornings we were there I woke up with a bad achy back.
Also on all three mornings we had a fantastic breakfast at the hotel. Previous reviews knocking the breakfasts were either wrong, or right and things have greatly improved recently. We loved them. Coffee and tea lovely, fresh and hot, great selection of hot or cold food (what is the difference between an Irish and English breakfast - mushrooms?), couldn't fault it.
On the Saturday we were out and about in Dublin, great city. Save money on taxis, the bus stop is a ten minute walk away. Service 25b takes about 25mins to the city centre, 8 Euro 10 for a family of four. We would highly recommend the Viking Splash tour and  the National Leprechaun Museum, fantastic. If you don't believe.....
Dinner at Nandos in the Liffey Valley shopping centre, a short 10 minute stroll back followed by drinks in the bar, with live music provided by a local duo singing everything from Coldplay to The Pogues. The bar was excellent, well serviced and stocked, with very reasonable prices and a relaxed demeanour.
Sunday was spent around the hotel, my wife noted later that we hadn't been outside once all day. What did we do? Swimming in the morning with the kids. We all loved the pool, please note if you have no hair left like me, you don't need a cap !
The water is very clean, not too ""chloriny"" and really warm. 
I ventured into the steamroom when the family had left to get changed, and had a very interesting and unexpected chat with a gentleman who was the doppelganger or identical twin of Brendan O'Carroll, or actually him as I suspect. He neither confirmed nor denied he was him, but did know a lot about him. I guess I will never know.
The rest of the day was spent watching sport on the bar tv and a second swimming session, but this time there were no superstars in the steamroom!
In the evening we dined in Gusto. The staff were fantastic. We were really looked after and couldn't fault the food, you have to try here.
Monday morning, early start before catching the Hopper Bus outside the lobby, followed by a three hour flight delay for a one hour flight, c'est la vie.
All in all a great three days, I can almost forgive the mattress. The staff here really are a credit to the hotel and we would recommend it to anybody we know who is going to Dublin, nice one.",4,2015,10,27
249,"Family friendly, great facilities!","Would highly recommend this hotel! We brought our little boy to the zoo for his 3rd birthday and wanted to make the weekend out of it. We were never short of activities at this hotel! Great location, only 15 minutes drive fron the Dublin zoo meant we were not too far away but still not in the middle of town either so we avoided most of the city center traffic. At the hotel we went swimming, played in the playground, played in the indoor play area, had amazing food in Gusto and all in all had a great stay! If you ate looking for somewhere the kids will enjoy too, stay here!!",5,2015,10,27

249,Grad,My family stayed here last week for our daughter's graduation.  I gave this hotel a review a couple of years ago and it wasn't a good one but I'm very happy to say I can now rectify that.  The rooms were comfortable .spacious.  I found the staff very professional and helpful. I think the restaurant prices are a little high for what you get. Over all a very pleasant stay. ,4,2015,10,26
249,Best hotel ever,"You should definitely come to the clarion hotel because of the food, bedding, friendliness and all the great stuff for kids.theres a great indoor pool, gym and spa that usage is free with your stay. The clarion is just of the m50 meaning it's close to everywhere including a 3 minute walk to Liffey valley shopping center",5,2015,10,26
249,What a surprise!!!,"Spent a quiet weekend in September 2015 at this hotel. This was my second stay. The first was October 2013 and was not a very pleasant experience with perople sitting in the lobby and outside the bar area with takeaway meals etc. The place was a mess. This time around I had such a pleasant stay.

The hotel has made some changes, not massive, but enough to certaiunly improve things. The staff here are very accommodating and polite and are extremely helpful and having read any of my previous reviews you will unfortunately find the only let down for me was in the bar, but in the meantime I it was an overall lovely stay.

The rooms are very comfortable indeed, no complaints or faults whatsoever to be found there. The bar food was a very pleasant surprise. Although the menu was limited and restricted to Asian food the standard and taste of the food was absolutely commendable and gorgeous. The Guinness was in 'quare order' which in my previous experiences is incredibly rare for a hotel bar. Here comes the one flaw!! On the second night there was change of bar staff who let the side down, one was young and more interested in trying to look good tossing glasses and the other, an older man was quite content, along with his colleague to serve Guinness and/or beers in warm, wet glasses just out of the dishwasher. Cardinal SIN!!!!!

The restaurant has changed also. The menu is mostly of the Italian theme, with a huge and very impressive open fired oven for pizzas, although they do a lovely steak and the chicken wings with chipotle sauce are to die for. The burgers looked impressive too, in fact it all looked extremely appetising. We all really enjoyed the food and drink this time round.Well done.

Overall this hotel is very clean, with lovely comfortable rooms, the staff are extremely efficient, helpful and polite (including check in staff) and I would certainly recommend a stay here.

I must point out that if you're not used to the motorway system and junctions, it is very easy to get lost. I know, I have been twice and you guessed it, got lost twice",4,2015,10,26
249,Family Friendly,This is our 5th stay in this hotel. We love going back here because the children loves this place. The pool is very safe and there is a bench where you can just sit and watch the children swim.Just love it,4,2015,10,26

I would stay there again.",4,2015,10,23
249,Excellent hotel ,"Stayed in the Clarion last night. Excellent staff and facilities. Love that the free Wi-Fi is just that. Not a trap for Bit-Buzz or the like.

Well done to all!!! ",5,2015,10,23
249,Stayed for the match night,"The hotel is fine, good location easy access. The rooms are well appointed with good beds. The restaurant serves good food although a little pricey. There is abundant parking but you have to pay 5 euros for the night which is crap really. The person who checked us in was rude, however all other staff were very pleasant. All in all its very handy for matches or shopping in Dublin with it being a short drive into town and would stay there again.",3,2015,10,22
249,Would recommend to anyone,"Arrived to check in and told our family room would not be ready for about 10 minutes, that was no problem.

249,uncompetitive rate for 1 night not including breakfast,"Disappointed with the rate especially as other hotels were also available at a cheaper rate and they had breakfast included.

249,Pleasantly surprised,"We stayed at the Clarion Hotel for one night, reception was polite and efficient on check in, when we arrived at our room it was lovely, a huge comfortable bed, good sized TV and spotlessly clean. we ate in the Gusto restaurant in the evening, the food was cooked beautifully service was excellent we had a lovely attentive waiter called Shane, nothing was too much trouble for him and when we left the restaurant and  speaking with the lady that was running the restaurant I think her name was Sian you could tell that she took a real pride in her staff and the way the restaurant was run. sadly the breakfast service wasn't quite as good in the morning but the food was well cooked. If we return to Dublin we will definitely be returning.",5,2015,10,18
249,Exceeds Expectations,"Great value. Great food. Very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient staff. A special thank you to Christopher (Duty Manager) who got his own car immediately, when he was informed of our predicament, in the middle of a very busy afternoon and jump started our car when the battery was flat (above and beyond the call of duty). It's things like this that exceed the customer's expectations!!!",5,2015,10,17
249,AVOID!,My partner got food poisoning on the first night we were there and was up for most of the night getting sick. We told them about it the next morning and again when we were leaving the hotel. The management were so rude. They claimed that we were lying and did nothing to help us and said it must have been something else we ate that day. The rest of trip was just tainted because of this. The rooms were very old fashioned. And the breakfast were quite greasy. The bacon in particular wasn't fully cooked. I wouldn't go back there. Avoid if you value your stomach.,1,2015,10,14

Two restaurants, Asian and Italian. Only the Asian restaurant was opened. But lovely food there.

Thought it was a bit expensive for a Sunday night at around 130 euro.
Asked for a cot in the room before we arrived and it was in the room when we checked in which is always nice to see.

Breakfast buffet was very good. Lots to choose from.

Swimming pool was great. Has a separate children's pool. Regarding the changing rooms, they have 2 separate cubicles (one has a changing table) to change the small people and there's also a cot in the changing room to stop the even smaller people from roaming around.

There's also a small kids play area in the hotel too.

249,Lovely stay in Dublin without having to face the city centre traffic,"We booked the Clarion for a night as we were planning a shopping trip in the city the following day.  It's a very big hotel but it is very well looked after.  

The staff at reception were welcoming and helpful.  We decided to take a swim (leisure facilities are free to guests) and go for a walk over to the shopping center as we had no plans on the evening of our stay. 
The leisure facilities were very clean, and there is also a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi if you don't fancy a swim.  The hotel seems quite child friendly as we spotted a playground adjoining the hotel grounds.
 
On the evening of our stay the Italian restaurant was closed so we decided to order room service from Kudos and watch the rugby.   We were waiting quite a while for our room service meals, but once they arrived we were more than satisfied.

The bed was very comfortable and there was no noise at all, so we had an enjoyable night's sleep before our big day of shopping!  There was also a fan in the corner of the room which would have been handy if it was a warmer night.  Breakfast is held in the same location as the Italian restaurant.  It is a large, bright open space with plenty of tables.  There was a great breakfast selection, and the quality of the breakfast foods was quite good.  

The location is handy if you're travelling from the west, and I'd say it's only another 15/20 minutes into the city centre.  We did not require public transport, but I believe there is a bus stop into the city close to the shopping centre.  

This is the furthest I've stayed outside of the city, but I would return again because the hotel is lovely and we had a very relaxing stay.",4,2015,09,29

We sat for a while & had a drink. This would have usually had us worried since it was so late around 11pm but it was fine, the room was very nice & we didn't have to wait too long. Plus we were glad of a drink after our flight. We only had breakfast & we both thought that was lovely. All in all very nice hotel. Such a short trip we would have liked to stay longer here & see more of Dublin. ",5,2015,09,29
249,Lovely,My family stayed here for 3 days as possible on the trip and greatly enjoyed our time. The rooms are big and clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly plus the fact of the parking is on site is very helpful. Also there is the fact that there is a shopping centre and cinema a short walk away meaning there is always food options available. Most importantly is that during the night the room is very quiet meaning we could catch up on sleep from a busy day seeing the sights around Dublin. We would certainly come here again.,4,2015,09,28
249,Good Customer Service Made Up For Poor Attention To Detail In The Kitchen,"Saturday afternoon shopping done in Liffey Valley and decided to finish off with a meal treat in the nearby Gusto Restaurant adjacent to the main reception in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley.
The Clarion Hotel is a popular and busy hotel at the crossroads where the West of Ireland the N4 meets Dublin’s M50 motorway archway to the City Centre itself or the potential to head to the North Country or Southbound.
Beside the busy reception area welcoming those from near and far is the Gusto Restaurant, with an inviting spectacle of a roomy Italian themed Restaurant.
Front of house hostess was very friendly who after checking for reservation quickly proceeded to reassure us that a table was available.
The Gusto restaurant is big and spacious with a nice balance of décor and looked spectacular as the sunshine from one of the finest Saturday’s this summer added a beautiful lustre to the lighting.
Our server was Anu who was brilliant from start to finish attentive friendly and someone who clearly cares and is very good at her job.
My daughter is a fussy teenager when it comes to food but she shares my feel good passion for a quality medium cooked good steak full of tenderness and  juiciness so she opted for the steak on offer €26.
The parents spotted the Pizza kitchen activity  and decided to go for some delights mine being a Calzone with Spinach. 
The timing was good and pretty soon our table was filling up with the food we ordered.
I found my Calzone a little doughy around the edges but the contents were favourable the spinach came in the form of leaves by the side which I would have preferred within the Pizza. I love spinach and always feel I am ticking off the nutrients and vitamin  box big time unfortunately I  am not mad about eating it served plainly or au naturale. Even Popeye my childhood hero got his out of a tin.
About halfway I noticed our Happy Face struggling with her steak and realised that it was very tough and a struggle to cut never mind eat. It has become a pastime of ours at this stage to sample each other’s steak looking for that perfect mouthful of quality meat cooked just enough to take it out of the no blood zone, pink and easy to cut and digest and for us medium has been that definition.
Even allowing for a hot platter and some belated cooking when it reaches the point where it is a tasteless jaw breaking rubbery piece of meat you’re working your way through I find it speaks more about the quality of the meat than the cooking status. Either way she abandoned it halfway. 
We think in generalities but we eat in detail and when it comes to steak the definitions of rare, medium, well done is the most important triangle for kitchen staff and diners and then only if the steak is of sufficient quality to reflect that culinary skill. My Dad always said only those who have to do simple things perfectly will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily. 
Steak came with chips which were nice big chunky chips perfectly cooked resulting in a real taste of potato.
I know we might sound picky and I hope we don’t come across as being unfair in anyway because what rebalanced our whole experience was Anu our server who demonstrated excellent customer service skills and offered to replace the steak and listened and acknowledged my comments about the steak.
We were time pressured and had satisfied our appetite so we were happy to leave well enough alone.
In fairness I  was very happy about our visit to Gusto because as Anu demonstrated there is a willingness to keep the customer satisfied and if I have any criticism to offer it is purely down to attention to detail within the kitchen.
We were happy enough with what we had consumed at that point and left not entirely happy with the food but more than happy with the way we were treated which works for me all the time.",4,2015,09,28
249,Enjoyable Stay,"If you have you're own transport or not too fussed about leaving the hotel then this is a cracking hotel.  It's around 25 minutes drive from Dublin centre with no obvious public transport around the hotel although taxis were constantly running in and out so if there's a few of you it wouldn't be so bad.

It's a large self contained hotel with a restaurant, bar, snack bar, pool & gym.  There's even a kids area although I doubt it would keep them entertained for too long.  Within walking distance there's an Off Licence, Restaurant & McDonalds.  Theres plenty of options for parking for vehicles of all sizes.

The rooms & hotel are modern and very clean.  Bed was comfortable although my double was a two singles together situation.  Rooms have all the usual mod cons including an iron, safe & refrigerator.  Shower was very powerful which is always a bonus for me.

The only downside for me was the WiFi which is free but not great especially in the rooms.

Staying for two days I tried all the eateries and the food was very nice.  The snack bar for lunch does fresh sandwiches and very nice coffee!  The bar serves Asain cuisine which seemed to lean to Thai type stuff.  The restaurant leans to Italian and very nice but slightly more formal as you'd expect.  The restaurant is where you eat your breakfast and the breakfast deserves special mention it's gorgeous! 

Pool & Gym are a bonus, clean untinimidating and free for hotel guests (as well as local members).

All in all defiantly enjoyed my stay here and will definitely book here again when working in Dublin.  Hotel chain kind of on par with Village Hotels in the UK.",4,2015,09,26
249,Very friendly staff and great service.,"This is my 3rd time to stay in this hotel and I can never find anything bad to say about it.  We were greeted at reception by Linda who was extremely helpful and friendly, she seemed like a lovely person.   Room was very spacious we had double and 2 single beds in room.  Only thing was that we would have preferred a room to the back of hotel, we had room to front and was a bit difficult to sleep with the noise.  Overall everything was excellent, staff in restaurant were so polite and friendly and food was gorgeous.   Will definitely continue to return to this hotel.",4,2015,09,24
249,HAPPY OUT.,"We enjoyed our stay over the 5 nights as always, but as we are regulars I thought we might get a better deal this time but there seems to be very little respect for regular customers . We also have stayed in Carton House a few times & it is owned by the same company.",5,2015,09,23
249,Don't expect food at the bar after 9:30!!,"The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was excellent but the bar staff were extremely rude and unprofessional not to mention that we were expecting to eat after returning to the hotel but as we did not arrive down after freshening up, we could not get anything to eat. We were told our two options were to get potato crisps or go to our room and order a sandwich. Why we could not order a sandwich at the bar is beyond me!!",3,2015,09,23

249,great for familys,"Stayed with 2 adults and three kids (16,11,6) and this is one of the few hotels that can take a larger group. We had loads of room and the kitchen is handy but basis. You would only be able to have breakfast and heat up food but most times that's all you need. Its also very handy for the airport and only took us 15 mins to get there at 11 at night

249,Far Away from City Centre,"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and didn't realize how far we were from the center of Dublin.  It was a average stay at the hotel with a good staff but the transportation to Dublin was lacking. We were told it was a 10 minute walk to the bus stop, more like 20-25 depending how fast you walk. Once we were on the bus it was about a 20 minute bus ride to the city.  The hotel is located next to the Liffey Valley shopping center which is your average mall.  It was very crowed with lots of people but it was a decent hotel.",3,2015,09,21

249,All I would want from a hotel.,"We had pre-booked and pre-paid our stay, so or check-in went smoothly, and we availed of the hotel's late check-out option - which is €25 - so we could sleep in, use the gym and shop in Liffey Valley Shopping centre the following morning/afternoon. This was money well spent, as it turns out,and it made or following day all the more enjoyable.

We were allocated a quiet, comfortable room, with a hot, satisfying shower on the lower ground floor, which was as much room as we needed for our overnight stay. 

We also used the gymnasium as planned (but didn't have time to use the pool) which was well-equipped and well-maintained, and was manned by a very helpful young woman. The use of the gym really helped us feel better after a long day at a wedding, the previous day.",5,2015,09,20
249,"Pretty average hotel, not really 4 star.","There is nothing exceptional about this hotel other than its position. Walking distance from Lemongrass Restaurant, two minutes from Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, close to busses into Dublin.
The rooms are ok, our superior room did not have air conditioning, or even a hair dryer. For some reason the rooms are always warm even without the radiators on. The bed was old, small and very creaky, every time you moved the noise would wake the other person. Three days running the room attendant only left two towels and we had to phone down for more.
We did not book breakfast for this four day visit however we took it on the first day. Pretty standard selection of hot and cold food, reasonable quality and quantity. There were two  choices of fruit juice, one was so watered down you could not tell if it was orange or pineapple, the other a deep red colour was so sweet it was sickly. Very limited selection of breads and cakes for a four star hotel.
Summing up this is not a great four star hotel however you are not paying four star hotel prices. The place is clean, the staff are ok, so you pretty much get what you pay for.",3,2015,09,20
249,Better choices out there,"Hotels esthetic appear was nice but looks can be deceiving. Frontdesk staff was not friendly or accomadating. They swore we had requested a rollaway bed when we did not and charged us 20 per night for the unused bed but were quick to pick it up. Several things in the room did not work (TV and light). The room had trash hidden around the furniture. I was not impressed by this experience.

Cant say anything about the food as I didnt eat there but we used the pool etc and again these were in excellent condition. Lots of people of all ages staying there as well as plenty of families.  Easy access from the m50 and to the liffey valley shopping.",5,2015,09,16
249,Nice Hotel,"On outskirts of city. There is a electronic toll on M50 best prepay rather than get a fine and 10 euro toll booth to docks. This was a surprise as we were unaware of this. Room was comfortable but not suitable for a long stay as very limited storage for clothes. Comfy bed and clean room and bathroom.  Downside was the lack of bright light suitable for reading in the bedroom common with many hotels but annoying none the less. Danger point was the tea making facilities in a open fronted cupboard with no light above tricky when dealing with boiling kettle in the gloom.  Health and safety issue which needs redressing. Breakfast service somewhat chaotic at peak periods but Staff brilliant, especially in the Italian evening restaurant. There was however a minor problem with one very unhelpful member of the reception staff, fortunately her colleagues made up for her rudeness and lack of knowledge.",4,2015,09,15
249,Not for us,"Family of 4 on short stay of 3 nights. Check-in in an obscure area..no centre to this hotel.Staff at leisure centre very good.Walk through the 'lobby', past a restaurant on the right to get to it (& back to door to rooms).Didn't enjoy our stay.",3,2015,09,15

249,weekend break for daughters birthday,We stayed at this hotel for our daughters birthday with the 2night deal for the tayto park. Perfect hotel location and it had a shopping centre just minutes away. On check in were were told that we had booked the tayto park 2night deal with breakfast both mornings. We had said to the staff about our dinner to which they told us there was no dinner in the deal. On checking our reservation when booking it it was no longer valid and we had been given a new reservation number which was very strange. Unfortunately we had not printed out the reservation out when we booked it but we are certain that it included dinner. Breakfast the first morning was cold and on the 2nd morning after asking 3staff members for tea and coffee we had nearly ate our breakfast by the time it come. On the Saturday night I had went down to the bar near reception to ask for ice and had to stand for roughly5minutes listening to 2staff members talking about a night out and completely ignored me. Very unprofessional. Informed staff on the Sunday morning when checking out that our iron in the room was leaking water and had burnt our daughters top. We also had emailed the hotel in relation to anything special that could be done for our daughters 3rd birthday and there was nothing.,4,2015,09,14

Staff here are first class and the gym is cracking too a proper health club feel and big pool / sauna area. 

Definitely return ....",4,2015,09,11
249,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for a week with family. Rooms and beds were lovely and comfortable. Everything was very clear and was explained well to us. Was told our room would be ready at 1500hrs but wasnt ready until around 1700hrs which was a little dissapointing as spent a lot of time hanging around in the lobby after spending a few hours in Dublin. If you order a taxi from reception there is a €2 fee added onto your taxi bill which i thought was a bit cheeky because if there was one outside in the carpark not prebooked they didnt charge the extra €2. Was slightly dissapointed as there were 4 young girls running around the hotel lobby harrassing customers for money for a sponsor which we found was faudulent and didnt exist. Was just exploiting people visiting, we reported to the hotel staff but we see them 4 out of the 7 days at the hotel and until the staff were made aware they were left to harrass visitors in the restaurants, lobby and bars. Other then that the hotel was lovely, food was lovely - tad overpriced for what it was and what prices you paid in other restaurants but a lovely place to stay. Very family orientated.",4,2015,09,09
249,Lovely warm welcome - excellent service,My wife and myself stayed for 3 nights from Saturday 05/09.

249,some improvement needed.,"we stayed here for location purposes,which is ideal for where we needed to be.
The room was a good size and very clean, however when i plugged in their hairdryer is got very hot and began to smoke! The manager replaced it, though i was very wary of using it.
The bar areas are very messy, tables inside and outside not cleared, the floor was covered in bits of food and litter, and the some of the staff were very rude, when we asked where the pool was one lady said ""don't know"" and walked off.
The dining room service was not the best, very slow and they brought our meals out in bit and pieces.
It could be a brilliant hotel, just needs a bit of tweaking and some new staff.",3,2015,09,07
249,3 night break - disappointing,"This hotel is spotlessly clean and in a great location for sight seeing. Really handy to main roads in and out of Dublin and has plenty to do on site.
We picked this hotel as it appeared to really cater for families. 
The food and drink available is good although drink is a little on the pricey side... A pint was cheaper on oconnell street!!
What lets this hotel down was the staff, some were very rude. Kids not allowed in the pool after 7pm and at 7.01pm we were loudly told in front of other guests to take our 3 yr old out of the pool. The 'barista' completely dismissed me when I asked him a.  Question about breakfast - he was standing beside the breakfast buffet-said this is not my area. The tourism advice is hit or miss, but hopefully like us you will find a kind taxi driver or. Another guest to give you advice when the reception staff are lacking, there were a number of other disappointments but again all to do with the service. I would use this hotel again as its clean and handy but I will come prepared and not have to seek any additional information from the staff",3,2015,09,06
249,Super family friendly restaurant,"4 hungry children, perfect portions. Efficient, friendly service. Clean and comfortable dining area and most importantly clear plates at the end. This has to be the nicest children's menu I've seen in quite a while.",5,2015,09,05
249,Tayto park trip and overnight stay,"Was very disappointed in my stay at the hotel. The staff are terribly rude and everything you ask makes you feel like you are doing something wrong. Maybe you need to educate your staff that we are the people who keep their wages comming and we will not be back. Room was decent apart from the 2p in the toilet when we arrived which obviously meant it wasn't cleaned. Our meal was the worst part of the stay- had to ask for table to be cleared. Had to ask for menus. Ordered our food and my vegetarian curry arrived before my soup starter which we had to ask where it was. After eating half of the curry i got a lump of chicken in my mouth. I was totally revolted. You need a change of chef as he obviously does not understand the simple concept that vegetarians do not eat chicken. I will be going further with this complaint. The pictures of the kids area makes it look very good but don't be fooled. We never got to see the teen room after 5 trips up and down to reception to get in,  they decided it was closed. Cheap stay but spend the extra few pounds because this place will dissapoint. ",2,2015,09,05
249,Family stay,"Stayed on a Monday night with kids, great teen room, good food and very comfortable rooms. Rooms were fresh and clean. Buffet breakfast was great and staff helpful and friendly. Shopping centre within walking distance and just off the motorway.

      ",5,2015,09,02
249,Good family deals,The hotel provides good value for money. It is exactly what you'd expect for this type of mass-market large hotel. It is very popular with families and offers good multi-night breaks. Breakfast can get quite busy and it is shameful to see some of the food that is needlessly wasted by greedy people overfilling their plates from the buffet breakfast. Note that you have to pay extra for parking (€5 per night).,3,2015,09,01
249,A Real Gamble,"This place I have stayed a few times (5-6) on business and it really is pot luck.  For example they have a business floor and if space you can get on there, if not your in lucks hands, social groups, children and families (especially in holiday season)
They may recommend the suites but they are really tired and whilst massive, feel like an 1980's apartment that was once awesome.

For reasons I am yet to fully discover - it gets booked long in advance online, but often a call to the hotel directly may result in a room being found!

I'm not a fan of the food, but they have a gusto and Asian cuisine on site and do a family for 4 special for Eu50 - so I guess you cant go wrong if with family.

Pool is decent, staff are really amazing other than breakfast where the service is woeful. They have self service tea and coffee but that's it, if you want something slightly different your struggling.

I will be back - if I can get a room where the neighbours are not allowing their kids to run riot - for the 2nd week in a row",2,2015,09,01
249,Fab hotel for familys,"Excellent location great for family breaks close to everything. stayed here for 2 nights in august. Would recommend to anyone. Only down fall was we had 2 family rooms booked for weeks before we went and i asked when booking for them to be together. Only to arrive to two completely different rooms and not together. One room had a double bed and 2 single beds the other had a double bed and pull out sofa bed, both of us Had paid the exact same price for the stay, so two kids had to sleep together where they didn't want to because they are at that age and boy and girl. Overall we enjoyed the stay and will be back 😁 ",5,2015,09,01
249,Family friendly hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights . Great hotel so child friendly was brilliant for the kids pool and entertainment etc .food was fab and the staff couldn't do enough. It's beside a big shopping centre and cinema and 20 mins from tayto park.Will def b bk,5,2015,09,01
249,Cheap and loud,"We stayed at the hotel during the four day visit to Dublin, choosing it on how cheap it was. The first thing we noticed was how far it actually was from the centre of Dublin. We may have saved on the hotel but we probably spent similar to a hotel in the centre due to travel expenses. The walk to the bus stop was also a good 15-20 minutes so we ended up sticking to taxis.
The room we were given was very spacious and well looked after however it was extremely hot meaning we had to leave a fan on throughout the night.
It was very popular with families and although I don't have a problem with children, it was very loud.
The food menu for the Asian restaurant was limited and expensive while the Italian Menu was slightly better and was very tasty.
We tried out the swimming pool and ended up paying 3 euros for a swim hat each and realising we needed a padlock in order to use the locker but apart from this it was very clean and well looked after.
Next time, we would definitely look for a hotel closer to the city centre.",3,2015,09,01
249,Great for families ,"Stayed in the Clarion  for 3 nights. Room was spotless, staff were very helpful and friendly and the leisure centre was great also. Didn't use the kids club bit there was a great selection of things on for children every day. Only downside for me was breakfast had to wait for 10 mins for coffee to be refilled and another 20 for boiled eggs to be brought out.",4,2015,09,01

249,Worst Hotel Experience,"I sent my sister with her partner & their two kids away for a 2 night stay in this hotel. Their kids are both below 4 so you can imagine its a total treat to get away from the norm and relax with them both. I had bought them tickets for the zoo as a present so they decided to stay over at the hotel. They were staying Fri-Sun. When they got to their 'family room' there was a cot for their 8 month old son which contained no mattress. They rang reception and they were brought up what they called a mattress. It was paper thin and hard which they expected the baby to sleep on. When they rang about this they were told that was the standard & they could give them a duvet or more cushions. They gave 2 towels for 4 people. The Air-Con in the room was not working so expecting a baby to sleep in cushions with no air-con was simply  not acceptable. As a result my sister had to sleep on the floor while they put the baby in the bed. My sister rang to tell me this. After all it was a gift from me so i felt totally responsible. I rang the hotel & spoke to a lady at reception who was very unpleasant and got quite ratty when i told her my thoughts. She the put me through to a MOD named Adam who told me that was standard and there was nothing they could do. I asked if there was some compensation? He then told me 'Oh i can include breakfast' their breakfast was already included. He then said oh i am sorry madam thats all i can offer. My sister then decided they would leave on Saturday instead. I told this too Adam & he said I would prefer if they stayed but theres nothing else I can do. 
 The hotel said they would refund the money to my card for the Saturday night which could take 10 days. I recieved a refund the other day. Upon checking my bank statement they had only refunded me €100 as opposed to €134.50. My sister called and they just said oh sorry it will take another 10 days to go through. 
 My sister left a chain in the room and the hotel refused to send it back she now has to get a family member to collect it for her. If this is a hotel policy of no sendbacks then fine but after the trouble & upset they caused I would have thought they would try avoid any more conflict. 

I work in a 5* hotel so I know what a good quality stay is and the standards in The Clarion are totally unacceptable. The staff were unhelpful and didnt seem too bothered if their guests were unhappy. I strongly recommend you avoid this hotel at all costs. ",1,2015,09,01

249,One night family stay young children,"V pleasant stay, great facilities for children. Used pool 3 to 5 as floats available. V busy but still enjoyable. Excellent meal in gusto restaurant. Magic tricks and balloons for children a nice touch. Went to see pizza oven and chef kindly gave our two children a little dough ball each to create their own mini pizza, v kind. Staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was busy at 8.45 but staff let us use quieter kudos restaurant which serves the same breakfast, even heated milk for little ones weetabix. Overall a family friendly, clean, modern hotel with all the facilities you would require. Great shopping centre near buy and about 15 min drive to zoo. Will definately go back. ",5,2015,08,30
249,could do better,"we stayed here for 2 nights. Room was fine, but as others have stated it was extremely warm. The beds were comfortable. 

our room was not serviced during our 2 night stay which was extremely frustrating as we are a family of 5(2 adults and 3 young children). 

my other issue was that the Fridge was broken which i discovered on day 2 after leaving food there all night. The fridge was fixed after i reported it but i lost food. at check out the girl at reception was very apologetic and took our parking off the bill. 

My feeling are this is not a 4 star hotel. they need to get their house keeping staff sorted out.",2,2015,08,30

249,Not a corporate hotel,"I stayed in this hotel last night on a corporate stay. Bone weary after driving over 800km in the day, I just needed sleep as if a very early start this morning. There were children racing up and down the hall until midnight, screaming, playing chasing games and my room was next to reception so they were aware of the noise. 
I mentioned at checkout that I was extremely disappointed that as a business visitor I was placed in the family section of the hotel and I didn't even get an apology. Wouldn't recommend this hotel for corporate visitors. ",1,2015,08,28
249,Cheap and cheerful,"Visited this hotel during the summer holidays with my wife and 3 kids (7, 4 and 2). There was an a lot to like. The pool is excellent, the breakfast is good, the staff are friendly, there's activities for the kids, the rooms are clean and the wifi is free (but slow). As other reviewers have pointed out, there's no air conditioning. Now personally, I have no problem with that. The hotel is not located in sub-saharan Africa and the room rate is cheap by 4 star standards. What I did have a problem with is that I discovered, only on our last night unfortunately, that the radiator couldn't be turned off completely and had been heating the room whenever the hotel heating had been turned on. Hopefully this will be fixed by the time somebody else stays in that room (342). The other problem was the combination of lots of kids and really long corridors which led to quite a bit of noise even up to midnight unfortunately. Now to be fair, this is to be expected in a family hotel (especially when the room rates are this reasonable) and there were a few signs asking parents to stop their kids running but I think the hotel could do more, for example by closing the heavy doors along the corridors.",3,2015,08,26
249,Happy family... Happy holiday,"Spent 2 nights here recently. Booked a family room. On checkin i was given a free upgrade to one of the suite appartments. They are beside the hotel. 

Best upgrade ever. Was out first time away with 2 kids and the appartment is a must for families. Within minutes they had our camp bed and cot in our room. The space was brill. 1 large superking room with tv, seperate bathroom, seperate kitchen with everything ud need except for pots (not that i was cooking but wud be handy all the same) living area was massive. Plenty of seating and storage.

Breakfast is great everything u need although a bit of a wait to be seated. Its a busy spot all morning.   There us a little area outside the main carpark if u can get a spot and its free. 👍  leisure center and pool is great open frim 9 and until 7pm for kids.

All round great family spot ",4,2015,08,26
249,Fabulous Hotel,"Just returned from our second visit to this fabulous hotel where we had purchased the 1 night Tayto Park deal with evening meal for 2 Adults and 2 Kids.

The hotel is immaculate, the kids loved the pool, the staff from start to finish are extremely friendly and genuinely do appear to love their jobs.  Other family members were also with us during the stay and everyone agrees that the food was absolutley georgous.

I cant praise the hotel enough and cant wait to return.

I dont ever write reviews, in fact this is my first, however I really felt this hotel deserved the praise.

Can I add that I am quite fussy :)",5,2015,08,26
249,Staycation,excellent experience overall however disappointed with meals - in the Kudos restaurant.  Breakfast also was not a good experience - had to chase for tea plus toasting machine had  a q. - no staff behind hot counter to offer poached/fried eggs and irish breakfast left a lot to be desired,3,2015,08,26
249,Great for families,"Nice standard hotel convenient to Dublin - great for a family stay. There were lots of activities for kids when we stayed in August and there were lots of families staying at that time. The restaurant was very good - plenty of choice, good quality food and friendly staff. The family room we had was a bit on the small side but it was clean and fine for the short time we were there. All the staff we met were friendly and efficient. We didn't use the leisure facilities and we skipped breakfast as the queue was very long at 0930.

249,"Great hotel, very close for shopping and zoo","Lovely hotel, receptionists very friendly and helpful, quick check in and out, room was clean, beds were comfy and breakfast had a good selection.  

Shopping centre is a 5-10min walk away and zoo very close by car.",5,2015,08,25
249,Great for kids,"The breakfast was very good, the beds were comfortable and the sevice was very helpful. Unfortunately the room was not very clean, but otherwise I would still recommend this hotel for a short stay in Dublin.",4,2015,08,24
249,A lot more than we were expecting!!!!,"We checked in after 11.00pm due to our flight time and having to collect our hire car.  A warm welcome, smooth check in and a huge surprise to be told that we had been upgraded to the suites.  Rooms spotlessly clean with everything we needed and best of all a huge comfy bed.  Headed to the bar and asked if they were still serving food which unfortunately had finished (we thought that may be the case) however the bar man made enquiries and then we were told we could have some sandwiches which was great.  All in all a great experience, nothing too much trouble and would recommend to anyone.  Only one negative point was having to pay 5 euro's to park in hotel car park overnight which I felt was a bit cheeky for paying guests.",5,2015,08,24
249,Great for families,"Stayed here for2 nights 19th-20th August with the tayto park package.3 kids(age 5,6 and7)2adults. We got an inter connecting room which worked really well. The kids loved it. Very clean, friendly staff, pool clean and again kids loved it. First time staying with the clarion would recommend it. Good location. Easy found and 20 min drive to the park and 2 mins from the Liffey valley shopping centre. Can't wait to go back 😀",4,2015,08,23
249,Very good,"Good value for money close to city centre, helpful freindly,  staff, clean rooms, nice restaurant, child friendly with lots if things to do for them, kids clubs, nice pool. Would recommend this hotel. .

249,Poor value,"Unfortunately the facilities are not large enough for the hotel when full. We had to queue for everything; breakfast, dinner, checkout, etc. The room was red hot and has no air conditioning. There were kids running riot everywhere.",2,2015,08,23
249,Nice hotel but couldn't sleep,"Lovely hotel and location 
But got ruined as could not sleep. It was very hot and no air con. They did give a fan but that dint do anything.  I did complain but 
They couldn't move us. It's a shame as did effected us and we were tired due to lack of sleep.

249,Not great,"Stayed here with my family for 3 nights, rooms extremely hot, staff not very pleasant,  need to learn how to smile , that includes lifeguard,  pool only ok, very annoyed at having to pay for parking, hotel is very clean and rooms are cleaned on a regular basis , but I would not recommend this hotel",1,2015,08,22
249,Great,"Lovely hotel .. lovely addition of a swimming pool that my son loved and a sauna. only a 5 minute walk away from a big shopping centre with McDonald's , cinema etc .. a couple of restaurants nearby who serve lovely food, an off license about 2 minutes walk away, park on site for children , the hotel was great when we got there they had us down as one night buy we had email confirmation for payment for 2 and they where great and sorted it there and then , lovely bar and restaurant on site ",5,2015,08,21
249,Mr Matty,What can I say?Fantastic stay.Brilliant for families with plenty to do for the little ones.Rooms were very clean if a little warm.Food was excellent in both Gusto & Kudos.A special mention must go to Robert in Kudos.His knowledge of Whisky & beer was incredible as was his enthusiasm for his job.will definitely return,5,2015,08,20
249,Pool - But not for us,"An important point to choose the hotel was the pool. But when we arrived in the late afternoon it was already closed for children. The opening hours for childs should be longer.
In the morning the queue for the breakfast room was long.
The rooms were clean and the staff very friendly.",3,2015,08,19
249,Fab Family Friendly Hotel,"Just back from a 2 night stay in the Clarion and wish it had have been longer. So much for kids to do, kids clubs, pool, movie nights. And the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The food is excellent. My only advice would be to book your restaurant table as soon as you arrive, we didnt and couldnt get a table on the first night in the Gusto restaurant. Rooms are very hot so be prepared although fans are provided which helps. Shopping centre within walking distance which also has a pirate village for kids up to 10. And you can drive to Dublin Zoo and Tayto Park within a short time. Cant wait to go back.",5,2015,08,19
249,Great family break,"Overall we had a really lovely, good value break away for the family.  Service was excellent, the food was great and our room was nice.  On the bad side, the air conditioning was broken so the room was very hot and the soap dispensers were pulled off the wall and thrown next to the sink with the broken bits of metal thrown next to it.  I would definitely stay here again though as it was a very good value family break.",4,2015,08,19
249,family break.,"Lovely hotel staff excellent in every way would definitely go back.if u have children make sure and find out pool times as I had 2 disappointed children when they couldn't get in 2 pool at 6.45.lovely stay .

249,Family Break Away,"Excellent stay as always at the Clarion. It's only place we stay when we are in Dublin.  Food is excellent, catering for us and kids too. Staff are very friendly and were very attentive. Kids love the pool and the kids club, there is so much for them too do.",5,2015,08,18
249,my review,"Not a great range of food for children and breakfast was notgreat, sausages notvnice. Room was very warms even with window open and fan on.
     So for that reason we found it very hard to get to sleep. Food in gusto restaurant was fantastic and staff very helpful.",3,2015,08,18
249,family,when booking I asked for a balcony room yet did not receive it in the hotel. very disappointing and was told I could not have one due to a family room yet there was various kids playing on balcony's throughout our stay. we wanted a balcony because we cant sleep when its too hot and this is a very hot hotel. disappointing on arrival finding out about no balcony but everything else was good very good staff,4,2015,08,18

249,comfortable,"We stayed 2 nights in a family room which had a double bed 2 singles and we asked for a travel cot for our 9 month old, the room was comfortable and clean, the hotels only letdown is that there was no Aircon in the bedrooms our room was looking onto the motorway so opening the window wasn't an option there was a standing fan in the room but the baby monitor still read 26 degrees, 

we ate in the Gusto restaurant, staff were very helpful and food was lovely and really reasonably priced",4,2015,08,16

249,Great location and excellent staff!,We stayed at the Clarion for the Ed Sheeran concert in July 2015. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful and the food was excellent. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the facilities and we will definitely be back to try out the kids club which looks fantastic. The location of the hotel is very convenient as it is just off the M50.,5,2015,08,16
249,Ok,"Room very warm window does not open enough and fan supplied is insuficient for family room including the constent humming of it all night.
Phoned at 130 to check was room ready for checkin was told it was.i arrived hour later and told room not ready had to wait further 30mins before able to get room.check in at hotel is 3 is why i phoned to enquire before arriving early.
Teen zone.that i brought my 8 and11yr to.this is a small exbedroom with Wii that hotel had no spare batteries for on night 1.two xbox kinex that were off and management did not have time to turn on..pool table that has the ball tray for dispensing balls  missing and insides ripped out. .no balls cues just looks like an old abandond table.Fussball with the electronics ripped out also unworkable.
5euro a night to park in the HOTEL CARPARK",3,2015,08,15
249,1 night stay,Have stayed here more than 15 times between hotel and apartments in the past. Pool and breakfast choice good. Reception staff average but they are so busy and noticeable understaffed. So they are doing their best with the resources they have. Room was unreal hot dangerous for small children and beds like sleeping on blocks. Shocking bad. Noise from hall from other guests and kids running riot terrible and no control from management on it. Noise of rd on this stay loud,3,2015,08,14
249,4 night family break,"fab hotel, fab food, top class and free wifi for the little monsters. Easy to find only minutes from m50 . We have stayed here before and the experience was even better this time, its a great hotel for all.",5,2015,08,14

249,Two night deal with Tayto Park vouchers,"Hotel was great value but it was a pity about the 2 hour delay at check in.
. Hotel deal included admission vouchers to Tayto Park, Location great for travelling to Tayto Park. Staff were very friendly and helpful. No Air conditioning in bedrooms, rooms were very warm and family found it difficult to sleep at night even with fans on. Leisure centre was good but there was no life guard on duty.",3,2015,08,13
249,Value for money,"The hotel rooms were very good for the family. The hotel is value for money. However, check in was slow. We received the key from one room, but we should wait for other room until after 5. The receptionist promised to let us know when the room will be ready, but she never did. I noticed that other people were waiting in reception area as well. 
Otherwise, everything was fine.  Rooms were lovely. The hotel is convenient for those who travel with the car, because it takes almost an hour to get into city centre with the bus. However, shopping centres are just a few minutes walk from the hotel. This was very convenient.",4,2015,08,13
249,Bring your own breakfast,"This a large budget hotel on the far edge of the city close to a large retail and industrial park We used it as my nephew lives nearby . But it is not suitable for a city centre visit . The airport is about 15 minutes away on the hopper bus . OK for a one nighter . Unfortunately we stayed for three nights just when they were doing Tayto Park special deals so the place was packed with children , check in took forever , much noise in the corridors and breakfast mayhem .
Probably better  outside of the school holidays .
We had a deluxe double  room which apart from an extra single bed we did not need was not very superior .
Breakfast if a poor affair in a cafateria style room . At 10.50 e for a continental it is poor value in fact I thought the hotel overall was poor value at least on what we paid . Maybe we should have been on the Tayo deal .",2,2015,08,12
249,Nice hotel,"We stayed her for 2 nights in August, the hotel was very busy.  The food in the restaurant Gusto was really good.  Only complaint was our room wasnt ready when we went to check in at 6pm, we didnt have to wait long but it was just a bit annoying after a long travel with kids.  Only complaint as the rest of the stay was great.  ",4,2015,08,12

Nice set up with a tv in each room, great that kids could watch their programmes on tv before going to sleep.  Very happy with the pool etc.  Good quality bed and furnishings.  

Negatives - housekeeping not up to scratch - hair on the wall of the shower, it obviously hadn't been cleaned.  Breakfast was a big let down, the food was warm, not hot, meaning that half way through the meal it was cold.  I did complain to staff afterwards and the complaint was well handled but a nice breakfast is an important part of a hotel stay for us and this was well below par.",3,2015,08,11
249,O&C,"Very disappointed with this hotel, we booked on line and thought 4* hotel checked some reviews and good price so thought it was a good option. It's quite old and a bit warn is the word I would use. Same little bar that doesn't look like a bar, the service behind the bar wasn't great at one stage 5 bar members walked by me without acknowledging me at all no eye contact so we just left and went to bed. Overall very disappointed and unhappy we ended up eating in Liffey valley..

249,just hit the spot,"We have just come back from a recent stay in Dublin and I have to say I am more than happy with this hotel. from start to finish of this stay I had no complaints, other than the car park fee.  I thought they would waiver this at the last minute as a gesture of goodwill.
We stayed in the family room , which was very comfortable by the way. When we requested extra towels and milk they arrived in jig time.!! 
The staff in the restaurant and they looked after us very well despite running out of certain deserts- so what -life goes on !!!!!  The staff at reception were extremely friendly and efficient. The food for both breakfast and dinner was excellent with a good choice. A very busy hotel - I am not surprised, they really cater for families very well and it its location is perfect for shopping, town, Tayto park .

249,Do not stay here,Stayed at Clarion Liffey Valley for 3 nights with husband and two kids. Room was big and beds were ok but the carpets were grubby. The room was melting hot no matter what time of day or night. We had two fans on constantly but there was no air conditioning. The weather at the time we stayed was not even warm so god only knows how stuffy the room would be if we got a good summer. Staff in restaurant were so unhelpful. asked a young waiter for pot of coffee one morning and he looked at us as if to say get it yourself.bathroom in room was ok but again could be better. the top of the bedside locker was black with mould/ mildew and was awful . we had to put a towel on it to cover it up. breakfast was a nightmare. you had to queue every monring for 20 mins just to get a table in the restaurant . ridiculous. and the food was again only average and cold most of the time. would never stay here again. pool was nice but very deep.,1,2015,08,10
249,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for Dublin Horse Show in this hotel. This hotel has everything one would expect, welcoming receptionist lovely staff and very clean decor in the hotel. Rooms are spacious and clean, we ate in the bar and the waitress was so helpful and polite, the food (Asian) was excellent and afterwards we were treated to the Trio band in the bar who made the night very enjoyable, they were so in touch with all the people in the bar walking from table to table asking for requests from the tables and knew every song that was thrown at them (even the Rose of Tralee.) very entertaining and pleasant. Breakfast was also top class . We would highly recommend this hotel (We recently stayed in the Clayton Hotel Leopardstown and The Clarion would put the Clayton into the dark ages for hotel hospitality and value for money).",5,2015,08,10
249,Summer hols 2015,"I found this Hotel fantastic value for money.  The location is fab because you are so close to everything.  We tried both Restaurants & couldn't fault food, it was delicious.

I'll certainly be back.

249,Family friendly rooms but hot,"Stayed 2 nights 2 adults 2 young kids on the 2 night b & TAYTO ticket package.  Loved the price and location as a short walk to fabulous indoor shopping centre restaurants and cinema.  Short drive to Tayto park and zoo. 

Check in was ok but robotic. Receptionist omitted to inform us which way the rooms were so we ended up on the wrong side of hotel which annoyed us as we were tired after a  long drive. Rooms were to left of reception but not visible from our check in desk so they would need to be more aware of this. 

Room was the best hotel family room we have had before with double bed and a single bed either side. Plenty of room ironing board tea/coffee safe, fridge big tv ! Only problem ..... room hot too hot had window open constantly and fan on too and the weather wasn't particularly hot. 
The swimming pool is ok. A bit small. Lifeguard on duty during kids times but some eegit was allowed to use a MASSIVE rubber tube ring which took up too much space and was a real nuisance.  Also 2 swim lanes set up during kids time so nit enough so a d for kids it's open to non residents so busy !! 

Ate in the main restaurant Gusto fantastic service, decor (like new) and food delicious.  I was impressed how good they were with the kids and the kids menu.  Not cheap but worth it for a treat.  Breakfast was fab help yourself style and staff very friendly arrive v good and kids were made to feel welcome. 

Hotel runs kids club with activities scheduled on noticeboard. Friday night was supposed to be a disco in a separate Conference suite next door. We turned up and there was one staff member on the door. She smiled a lot but when we asked if there was a charge she said she didn't know and left us hanging.  But awkward. Went in anyway as she didnt appear to care. People coming in after signed in but we were never asked to ? Temp tattoos painter for kids which was great and a mini disco but no one facilitating it so people just sitting about.  Atmosphere was awkward do we left quickly !! 

All in all a great hotel and we look forward to retuning as family packages excellent value.",4,2015,08,08

*Good location - next to liffey valley shopping centre.
*20 mins from Dublin zoo (our destination)
*HUGE hotel.. room was nice and clean but felt like we were walking for ages down the long corridors to get there from reception.
* Breakfast was ok.. cold air con was a bit off putting. Kinda made our food cold fast. Good selection. Very busy. 
* Bar food was good, restaurant was book only and we didn't want that - more comfy with our son in the bar! :) 
* Swimming pool was ""Awesome"" according to our son.
* Offers games room to teens to relax without parents & small kids- open upon request.

Overall, we had a nice stay and would return in the future.",3,2015,08,07
249,Very disappointed,This was our second time staying in this hotel. I will not be back. I was traveling with my husband and my 8 year old son. I booked a 	Superior Family Room. When we went into the room there was a double bed and a sofa bed. I went back down to reception I showed the girl the email I got all she said was do you want me to get the sofa bed made up. No apology. Our room was by a main road so it was very noisy. To be fair the man called up within 15mins to make it.,2,2015,08,06

249,Great family hotel,"Great hotel and staff. Very clean and good food. Id definately go back and would reccommend

Only bad points
There was no temp control in the bedroom, the vent felt like it was blowing warm air. We slept with the window open and the fan running which ment lots of noise from the M50 and the drone of the fan.

Also had to pay €5 per night to park the car in the hotel. There was no concession for guests. 

The sauna was out of order for the duration of the stay. ",4,2015,08,04
249,Gusto Restaurant...would never eat there again!,"My daughter just have a baby recently so I decided to treat her to a meal in Gusto restaurant. That meal was quite nice and we were served by a friendly young waitress. We finished the meal, paid our bill and said goodbye to the waitress who was standing beside a senior member of staff (in a black suit) bearing in mind this person had shown us to our table when we arrived. We proceeded through the fairly full foyer to the ticket machine to validate the parking ticket and as we did so the staff member (black suit) passed by a few metres away and shouted over to us 'you did fix up your bill, did yas'? My daughter and I were totally taking aback. I want over and asked her was there a problem and she said she was just checking that we had paid our bill. Totally embarrassed and humiliated in front of a packed foyer we left the Hotel, however I want back to confront this person who said 'she didn't mean anything personal by it' and was very dismissive. I told her she should have checked with her staff before approaching us in that manner but she gave some lame excuse that she didn't know who our server was. She didn't even have the decency to stop what she was doing or to even give a proper apology. I was so upset that I failed to get her name and I later rang the Duty manager who was apologetic, however he didn't even take my name and there was no follow up to my complaint. Although we enjoyed the meal the evening was totally ruined. I am a local of the area and this restaurant came highly recommended by a friend of mine who was at the launch, however I would never eat there again and I will certainly not be recommending Gusto's.",1,2015,08,04

249,Let down,"Stayed in this hotel 31st July -2nd August 2015. Check in was a long process with a language barrier proving to be quite difficult. We asked how far tayto park is from hotel and we were told its in Derry so could be approx 1.5 hours away!! 
Rooms are fine, clean and tidy, however extremely noisy during the night.. Music prolonged into early hours of the morning.. This was challenging with 2 young kids.
We dined in the gusto restaurant the first evening, where we had to wait an hour and a half on our main course arriving. Again kids becoming fed up and bored.. 
The kids play area is very disappointing.. It's tiny with very little to do. 
Swimming pool is good, kids did enjoy it.
We dined in kudos the 2nd ecening which was a horrendous experience.. We had to ask the waiter to remove the dirty plates etc off our table, which was eventually done, the table wasn't cleaned. He forgot to give us menus and then come to take our order.. The mains arrived before the starters!! To top it all off, my vegetarian friend ordered a vegetable curry which she discovered chicken and beef in after she had eaten quite a bit if it.. This was the worst service I have ever experienced to date.. To contaminate a vegetarians meal with meat is not only revolting but extremely offensive!
I can honestly say we will not be returning to this hotel.",2,2015,08,04
249,very rude staff," From check in to check out staff very rude more so at breakfast time! Would not recommend thid hotel as all the staff need to be retrained in customer relations. Dirty plates/cutlery at breakfast, hot glasses for juice/water when asked for clean plates was left waiting 15mins!

249,Top value hotel,Great location.  Great value for money.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Hotel  comfortable and clean.  Food excellent.  Music by Tropical Storm excellent and very entertaining and friendly  play there twice a month. Will definitely be back. ,5,2015,08,04
249,Great Family Hotel,Had an excellent stay with Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley last weekend. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were upgraded from a triple room to an apartment on arrival which was great as we were travelling with our daughter. The apartment was wonderful with excellent facilities. The hotel had kids pool and playground which meant bad weather didn't dampen our stay. Excellent all round. My only regret is we didn't stay longer!,5,2015,08,03
249,Excellent value for money,Excellent value for money. Reception staff lovely but the waiting was a bit too long could have more staff on. The breakfast staff were excellent we traveled with small children and they could be more friendly or helpful. I'd definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2015,08,03
249,I don't know,"Very friendly reception staff.  
Got upgraded to an apartment which was great and a good size for three people.  Wifi in room, kettle, washing machine, microwave x 2, and ironing facilities, but no hairdryer.   However, only staying for one night as we were going to function next day.  My mistake was thinking there was a hairdryer in the apartment and only checking when I had washed my hair, none!   Put a call to reception and to cut a long story short got a hairdryer an hour later.  Now  frizzy hair would not normally bother me , but I had a function to attend!   
The hotel was very busy and breakfast was chaotic, and at one point, no milk in the urn, no cereal dishes and no coffee.  The cereal table is parallel to hot food and in my opinion far too close as the two lines kept bumping into each other.  The staff were doing their best to cope and in fairness my wet lank hair might have skewed my overall opinion!  The gym facility is great.  
The carpet in the apartment and at the entrance to the aparts. Is bubbling and may be a trip hazard.  A taxi into dublin around 20 euro.  There were a lot of families at the hotel and it is good value for one night stay.  Probably won't stay again.  ",3,2015,08,03
249,Not impressed with this hotel,"Had early fight from Dublin airport and decided to stay at this particular hotel as it seemed child friendly.  Plan was for my son and his dad to spend time in ""games"" room playing some pool.  Son was so disappointed to find pool table was there but it was broken!! this is peak family holiday time and hotel should ensure that such amenities are working and if not remove the item from the games room.  I was also very disappointed to find out that I had to pay to park my car at hotel.  In addition to both of these negative things I also need to add that I requested a 5.30am wake up call that didn't happen.  When I advised the receptionist of this they advised it was set up but that the automated machine must not be working.  Overall I was not impressed with this hotel and won't be making plans to stay there again.",2,2015,08,03
249,Service was bad,Food cold had to ask numinous times for things to be both to the table by time it was got our food was cold.we had to be move 3 times into different rooms during our 4 nights stay kids room was a disaster  nothing working ,1,2015,08,03
249,Excellent hotel,"Stayed in apartments, family of 5, very spacious, would def go back again, they were brilliant.  Food was also excellent. Staff helpful and lovely.  Used pool which was grand too.  Location was ideal as we didnt want to go into Dublin city centre but yet still close to Liffey Valley shopping centre for shops , restaurants etc.
      
      
      
      ",5,2015,08,02
249,"Family Friendly, Fun and Fantastic Value","The room was spotlessly clean. The pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were well maintained.  The two restaurants in the Hotel provided reasonably priced food and we particularly enjoyed an Asian meal, two adults and two children with the added bonus of free cinema tickets for the Vue Complex which is a short distance away at the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.  To the left of the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre you will find a bridge/pedestrian walk way over the motorway, where you can get at bus into Dublin.  Bus are frequent, but you will need the correct coins for the fare - two adults and two children - 8 Euro 40 Cents.  Bus number 25. With our family deal we had free tickets for Dublin Zoo  and Tayto Park.  We took the bus, for Dublin Zoo (number 66).  As we already had our tickets provided by the Hotel, we were able to sail past the queue and go straight in. We arrived at around 11:00am and did not leave to almost 6:00pm lots to see and kept two 13 year old kids amused.  Tayto Park, we were told by reception is tricky to reach by bus and it is therefore best to go by car. Satnav recommend for getting there, if you and hubby want to keep the stress levels down.  Ample parking at Tayto Park.  The entry fee is covered by the tickets provided by the Hotel, which saves around 14 Euro each.  You will then need to purchase either tokens or arm bands for entry to the rides.  If you have teenagers, as we do, then it is a no brainer, you get the arm bands which cover all rides and cost 15 Euros each. One ride on the new roller coaster is 5 tokens, so your tokens will go fast.  As there are height restrictions on many of the rides you may want to consider buying tokens for smaller children.  The tokens and arms bands can be purchased in the second kiosk on the left hand side when you go out through the main building/ shop.  You will received two free multi packs of Tatyo crisps per two arm bands purchased.  If you bring a picnic you can leave it in your car and can easily go back and get it later rather than carrying it about all day, just make sure that you get your hand stamped before you exit to the car park.  We chose to go on a Thursday purely because it was the best weather forecast for the week we were staying.  Queues were not as bad as we expected and my daughters were able to go on the roller coaster multiple times.  The 5D Cinema was a bit of a wait to get into but was worth it.  The zip line was also a longish wait.",4,2015,08,02
249,Only ok.,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food in the bar which served Asian food was lovely while the other restaurant was very over priced. 

Rooms were very clean but the traffic from the motorway kept us up nearly all night, found it really hard to sleep. 

Rooms were really hot too but there was a fan which came in handy. 

Swimming pool was only ok, all one dept and I found it to be a bit dirty. U could feel the grit from the tiles as u walked through the pool.

Only reason we stayed at the hotel was because it was near the airport and easy to get to the city. ",3,2015,08,02
249,Nothing special,Stayed for 2 notes. Glad it wasn't longer. Gusto restaurant was beautiful and some of the staff where friendly others walking around not knowing what to do. Kudos restaurant \bar filthy dirty and some of the bar staff were clueless and very unhelpful. Overall not great and won't b back. Kids club was rubbish,3,2015,08,02
249,"Great value, family friendly","Great family bundle packages available, multi-nights with breakfasts and you never feel like you shouldn't be here with your kids.

Nice touch having a magician on making balloon toys during the meal and the availability of other kid distraction services was good too.

249,Excellent for the family,"Stayed in the Clarion last week (2 adults , 4 children - ages ranging from 5 to 16). The lady on the phone was very helpful when we were booking , we planned to visit the zoo , she went through all the options with us and made sure we had the best value deal available (in the end saving us over 60 euro between accommodation and zoo tickets).
We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday, the rooms were perfect ,exactly what we asked for (2 adjoining rooms - 1 family , 1 double ). 
The rooms / bathroom etc. were spotless. We ventured down to the pool at around 5 pm . The pool was quite busy (which was to be expected  for that time of day - weather outside was not great ). What impressed me most were the life guards, they were very attentive , positioned themselves at the edge of the pool ..very vigilant !
The best was yet to come , we ate both nights in Gustos restaurant. It is an Italian restaurant . The food both nights was excellent , plenty choice for young and older alike .  The lady in charge of the restaurant (sorry didn't get her name ), was brilliant ! She was very professional  and attentive . There was a balloon blower the second night and despite the restaurant being very busy she made sure that every child got a balloon .
Gustos does get quite busy so I would recommend early booking. Breakfast time is very busy after 8.30 am which is to be expected for a family hotel.
All in all a very good experience , will definitely be going back!",4,2015,08,02
249,never go to this hotel,"so we arrived at 4.30 to check in our room was n't ready. Check in was suppose to be from 3 PM.
We pay for a meal with our room and we were told we could got to either of the two restaurants in the hotel at any between 7 and 10 PM. We went to the Asian restaurant and we were told we would have to pay 18 euro 50 each for our meal. We then went to the other restaurant and were told we needed a reservation. After complaining we were  given a table after a 15 minute wait.
Service was very poor, it took 2 hours to be served a three course meal, we had 2 children one 4 months and the other 6 years so this was a long time to wait for service. Food quality was terrible. The room was very small and cramped and people were making noise and slamming door up to 1 am.",1,2015,08,01
249,"Brilliant Hotel, Great Location for touring Dublin.","Just returned from a fantastic 4 night stay with My Husband & two Lil Boys. We got a brilliant deal of 4 nights b&b, 1 dinner (3 courses for all 4 of us), family pass for Tayto Park & family pass for Dublin Zoo all for €489 - FANTASTIC value. The staff are sooooo friendly from reception, to breakfast staff, from managers to bar/restaurant staff, especially Desmond in Kudos restaurant who was fantastic with our Boys. 
One room was very spacious, spotlessly clean.& very quiet. 
a fantastic location for touring around Dublin. Also has a beautiful well staffed pool.
Exceptional family friendly hotel. This was our second time staying here and we would definitely return again.
We would all highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,31
249,The Best Hotel by Far,"What can I say ,this hotel was just perfect, from the minute me and my 5 kids arrived we were treated like we were the most important people there.i got a flat tyre the morning I was leaving and Chris errity the manager went above and beyond his duties ,reassuring me that everything would be ok he rang around and got someone to come fix it ..he knew I was on my own with the kids and his service was just outstanding ,the staff were friendly and good craic too ...il def be back ",5,2015,07,29
249,Good location,The hotel was very well situated close to Dublin but not so close that you where stuck in traffic trying to drive everywhere which suited us. We found the room to be average enough even tho the price was basic and perhaps priced a bit steep at €320 for 2 nights. Shopping centre within walking distance. Would stay again if the rates were not as high ,4,2015,07,29
249,Needs a little updating,"This is a great place for families. We had 2 nights free as we are members and we were upgraded to a suite. This had everything a family would need...a full kitchen with dishwasher and a clothes washer/dryer. The rugs, curtains just need to be replace as they are showing wearing. The Italian restaurant is good too.",4,2015,07,28
249,Family visit,"Slight mixup when we checked in as interconnecting rooms were on opposite sides of the corridor. Was sorted by Martina in reception within approx 90 mins which was ok. Stayed for 5 nights and my 4 kids loved the Hotel, the breakfasts and dinner, the play area. Myself and my wife liked it too. Staff good and very helpful. Location great for day trips to Dublin Zoo, Tayto Park etc. Happy to stay again. Entry barrier can cause confusion when you first arrive.",4,2015,07,28
249,Liffey Valley Clarion Family Break,"Mostly very good with a few small issues.  The pool was not in use when we stayed but we were advised that we could use the pool at another hotel 15 minutes drive away.  When we wanted to go to the pool we were advised to ask at reception in The Clarion & we would be given passes.  When we did it took reception nearly 30 minutes to get this organised.

249,Sharon,"Have stayed in this hotel several times, friendly and very helpful staff, great service comfort and cleanliness. Breakfast was first class. Stayed for concert, return bus was left on at 12 euro per head which was excellent. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend.
      
      ",5,2015,07,28
249,Room was far too hot,"Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was good.  Our stay,however, was ruined by the heat in the bedroom.  It was uncomfortably hot despite there being a fan in the room (which leads me to believe it's an ongoing problem).  I would be very reluctant to stay in the hotel again if I thought the same thing would happen again.

Also, I received a phone call the day before we arrived to say the pool was out of commission.  We were told that we would be given complimentary access to the kids club and passes to the green isle hotel to use their pool.  Neither of theses were offered to us on check in.
We were given complimentary parking by way of an apology for the heat in the room but I felt this was a poor attempt at an apology.",2,2015,07,28
249,Great Hotel,"Always like staying here staff are friendly and very accommodating, usually the price is not an issue and you tend to get a good rate, but this time was more expensive as there was a concert on in Dublin but the Clarion was still the best value. I would stay here again ",5,2015,07,28
249,Excellent location,Excellent location and close to all amenities and also a bus trip to the city is only a five min walk away near the shopping complex...im disappointed tho having stayed numerous times before on the room we were given...With haven been there before I know there is nicer and more spacious rooms... we found our room stuffy..staff are always welcoming and helpful would stay again and would recommend to single..couple..family... It is ideal for all! ,4,2015,07,27

249,Ed Sheeran Weekend,"Stayed here for four days as a birthday break/Ed Sheeran visit! Loved every minute of it. We were checked in quickly and efficiently and made our way up to the room! 
I had previously emailed the duty manager Adam to ask him if anything special could be done for my boyfriends birthday and he didn't disappoint! We arrived to drinks and a gorgeous room with a balcony so a massive Thank You Adam. It really made our weekend special! The breakfast and pool were an excellent addition also! 
On the Saturday night we dined in the Gusto restaurant which was great- a special mention to Shane who wasn't our server but his enthusiasm and personality demonstrated all the values of hospitality- he is a credit to you! All in all an excellent stay and I can't wait to return again soon!

249,Review,"Describe the service you experienced: service was good
Tell us how you liked the room: carpets needed a little revamping throughout hotel...
Talk about the location & amenities: would have ben nice to have had a cafeteria for coffee. Location was a bit industrial. 
Say what you liked best & least: Least liked : the car parking fee having paid a lot to stay at the hotel to then pay another fee for the car park.

249,Close to Shopping and National Aquatic Centre,"Stayed at this hotel while a family member was competing in a 5 day Swim Competition at the nearby National Aquatic Centre. Therefore we needed somewhere within easy driving distance to Blanchardstown, good, quiet hotel rooms, and a very early morning breakfast. WIFI was also desirable.
This hotel delivered on all of these requests. Our room overlooked the front car park, and we were not troubled with noise, even though the hotel was full to capacity with tour groups and large groups of teenagers also competing at the NAC, there was no noise at night. Breakfast was served from 6am, and hot food available. WIFI was excellent, all over the hotel. 
The Gusto restaurant was very good. There was a swimming pool in the hotel complex, but we did not use it.
I was aware of other people staying who were in Family suites/apartments with washing machines and cooking facilities, therefore an excellent option for large families.
I would definitely recommend this hotel, and plan to return.",4,2015,07,26
249,Tayto park deal,"We have stay here a few times. Its a great hotel if u have a young family. We ate in the new gusto restaurant which wss very good.
The only downfall was the beds in that particular room were as hard as  the road and the pillows and duvets were way past there best. I asked if we could pay for an upgrade but there wasnt any executive rooms available
All round good hotel but we all came home very tired due to lack of sleep.",3,2015,07,26

249,Beware of the hidden charges,"On the face of it this hotel is a very attractive place to stay - it offers a swimming pool, gym, conference facilities and two fantastic restaurants.
The rooms are spacious and clean,the beds are comfortable, there is tea making facilities but no biscuits.
There is an ironing board and an iron but more importantly the curtains are perfect they produce a perfect blackout and there is free unlimited broadband.
But be aware there is a hidden charge - if you arrive by car you have to pay 5 euro every 24 hours for parking absolutely shocking.
Another down side to this hotel is that it appears to be a very popular stop over for coach parties and the reception is not geared to cope - so if you arrive whilst a coach party is checking in be prepared for a long wait",3,2015,07,22
249,Business meeting,"I recently attended a business meeting in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley where I was greeted by Restaurant Supervisor Sháuna, who immediately made us welcome with her warm smile and friendly banter. 

Shauna was extremely friendly and professional from the very first minute. We were introduced to William who showed us to our meeting room and ensured we had everything we needed from tea and coffee to sandwiches.

Our meeting was made enjoyable by the service we received from both Sháuna and William thank you both",5,2015,07,22
249,Good deal for family with tatyo passes,"We had a 2 night family break with Tatyo park passes. Hotel is in good location with a good shopping centre and cinema within walking distance. Secure car parking at a cost of €5 per night. Found the bed very uncomfortable and the room was very warm, no airconditioning! Breakfast time is busy but it all depends on what time you go down at. Good selection of foods but the orange juice tasted like diluted juice. We had an evening meal in Gusto which was really good, lovely pasta /pizza. Overall for the price it was all very good, the kids 13 & 10 throughly enjoyed the hotel, pool and tatyo park was brilliant! ",4,2015,07,18
249,"Good service, Great value","The Staff are very helpful, especially the restaurant staff. The rooms are very spacious, ideal for families. It was a great location as we went to Tayto Park and the Zoo which are close enough. The bad point is that the rooms do not have air con so we had to use a fan which was ok. Also we used a cup for coffee in the room which the cleaning staff missed for 2 days.
I would recommend this for families as they have a great kids club and the health club has plenty for the parents while the kids are at kids club! ",3,2015,07,18
249,Great location ,"Just after checking out of the clarion hotel liffey valley and have to say it is a great hotel for a family break in Dublin. Part of our package included tickets for the zoo and tayto park which the kids really enjoyed. The weather was great too which helped. The rooms are very comfortable, pool changing very  clean and most of all the staff are very friendly. A small issue in the restaurant on the second evening was quickly resolved by restaurant manager (sorry can't remember his name ). A special word of thanks to Christina in gustos and Evan for the lovely coffees. Hope to go back soon  😊 ",5,2015,07,17

249,"No parking, No Quiet Room - Awful","Booked hotel as I was delivering close by. The hotel suggested as I was there on business to have a quiet room. What's the point in offering this if you can't deliver? The hotel were pre notified of parking requirements, again nothing arranged. Children outside my room playing flutes at 11pm gone, other guests making noise all through the night. It was just terrible from start to finish. Hotel offered me a complimentary breakfast by way of apology, however considering i'd had no sleep and spent over £100 on the room, I thought it was quite insulting. ",2,2015,07,16
249,very good hotel,"The hotel did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable.  I would be happy to stay again.  location was excellent and very accessible.  check in and out was friendly and efficient.  restaurant was very good and friendly. bedrooms were very comfortable.

249,Comfortable rooms... that's it...,"Not normally ones to write reviews, this time we feel we need to after paying €186 for b&b for one night.  Let's start positive because the location (if using your own car) is very good as it's just off the M50.  The hotel overall was very clean and our room was very clean, fresh and comfortable.  However, the room was booked for 3 guests and we did get a double / single room but the tea making facility & bathroom were only set for one guest!  The €5 for parking was a surprise on arrival!!!  The staff seem to be on autopilot, which isn't very inviting, they did & said what they had to and that was it basically, no 'chit chat', we found them very cold towards guests.  Customer service training for all required as a matter of urgency.  Now where do we start with the ""breakfast""... it was just terrible... we got a table and were quickly shown where the buffet breakfast was... firstly the selection is very small.  The food and juices available are of very poor quality - tasteless and obviously not fresh produce, the cheeses available are plastic, the cereal was mostly dust from the bottom of the bag and the orange juice was shockingly bad.  The hot drinks were cold - is a nice cup of hot tea in the morning too much to ask?  To the cleaning staff, keep it up.  All other staff and especially the breakfast need to be reviewed ASAP.  4*??",2,2015,07,14
249,Disappointing,"I will preface my comments by explaining - I am not the critical type. I have stay in bad hotels before, but never complained.Here is a 4 star rated hotel , which for the want of some more effort could actually/possibly remain a four star hotel. Cleaning and cleanliness is not up to the standard required of any hotel. The painted wall behind the reception is noticeably dirty. It doesn't matter if a million people come through those hotel doors. The presentation has to be good every time. 
      
      ",1,2015,07,14
249,Some disappointments but on the whole a positive experience.,"Hotel parking was reasonable at 5 euro per day. Parking was secure and hotel not too far from city centre. We were disappointed, as some have already shared, that the pool was closed for the first three days of our break. Some recompense would have been appreciated. The rooms were very warm as well but there were fans and the beds were comfortable. Younger kids (below 10 years) are well catered for but the advertised teen room is a con... The games are all broken and there are no cues etc etc etc. 
On the positive, hotel staff were most obliging and the breakfast very good. Allergies were also taken into consideration and nothing was too much bother in the Italian restaurant. The meal in the hotel was of a very good standard, although wine was a bit on the pricey side. The fitness suite was top notch and the swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room very good. My teenage daughter was however very miffed that she was not allowed to use any of these facilities apart from the swimming pool! Our package deal included trips to Tayto Park and Dublin Zoo and all in all I couldn't argue with the price. Excellent value for money.",4,2015,07,13
249,"Nice hotel, good value",As above. Had to wait an hour to check as room not ready. Not easy with three boys aged under 8. Main pool was closed for 3 of our 4 day stay. Staff offered free parking and kids club which was nice. Good hotel stay otherwise. Rooms exceptionally hot at night,4,2015,07,13
249,Good,"This hotel is a wee bit out of Dublin. We drove to it from the airport but used public transport to get in and out of Dublin as it was less stressful and easier than driving and finding parking. The bus stop is about a 10 minute walk near the Liffey Valley shopping centre. We bought a family leap card from the local newsagents in the centre which opens at 09.30 so don't expect to leave before then if you want to make an early start. Buses were very frequent.

On arrival to hotel we discovered that the pool was closed which was a shame as we had booked it for that reason but it did re-open after a few fays and we enjoyed a splash about. You have to wear swim caps so either take one with you or pay 3 euro to purchase one at the desk.

The room itself was very spacious lots of places to put clothes etc. We had a room with a large king size bed and a single for our son. It had a mini bar but unfortunately this was empty so we just used the fridge to keep drinks and things cool which was handy.

The room was very hot, no AC but did have a large fan which was on all the time and the window was always open. Spent most nights sleeping above the covers as it was so hot.

Had a couple of nights with noisy neighbours which didn't help as they were banging doors constantly and shouting but this isn't the hotels fault but the doors closing can be noisy and frustrating. Perhaps having signs up in the corridors asking people to be quiet like Premier Inns do might help? 

Breakfast was good. It was a buffet and sometimes got very busy and things kept running out but were quickly replenished by the staff.

Overall it was a good stay.",3,2015,07,13
249,Family break,We were very disappointed with hotel they did not inform us that the swimming pool was closed to visitors until we arrived at pool with children  who were not happy as we had chosen this hotel for pool and location There was no air conditioning in bedroom which made it very uncomfortable at night  ,3,2015,07,12

249,Short city stay,"I would have appreciated an e-mail informing us of the impending closure of the main 
pool as we  travelled with kids there was no aircon in the room  just a fan The room did not Seem to be hoovered either also i had to unblock the sink as it was blocked everything was excellent. Cheers

249,oh dear !,"I stayed in the hotel on business trip to Dublin. Rate was north of 100€ for B&B and for that you expect a certain level as standard. No air con in the room for a start was a disaster as the room was like an oven.(warm, muggy day in Dublin) There was a fan on a stand but all it was doing was recirculating warm air. I ate in Lemongrass which is not part of the hotel so cannot comment on food. I was on the 5th floor and wifi was poor. In the morning I attempted to shower at 7 but there was no water in the taps, very annoyed was an understatement I phoned reception to be told they were working on it. I had a breakfast meeting in the hotel which I attended unshaven and unwashed. ! When I got back to my room the water was back. .........I will not be rushing back. I stay in hotels around Ireland every week on business and for the money I paid expect more.",2,2015,07,10
249,Better than what you see outside,"In Dublin on business and then pleasure.  We picked Liffey Valley for a few days because it was within taxi of Dublin but not too close as to be expensive.( Taxi about 17 EUR to Dublin and 50 from airport).  And the taxi drivers are the most friendliest we have every come across.    Hotel much to look at when you first drive up, but it will surprise you with the nice rooms, good restaurant and excellent fitness center and indoor pool.  Remember no one available to get your bags. You are on your own in any hotel in Ireland.  Take the time to spend two days in Dublin.  Just get left off anywhere in the city and start walking.  You can then again get a taxi anywhere on the street.  All staff very friendly.  Room was small and no view of anything, but quiet and doors that open to outside.  Hotel within walking distance of large shopping mall.  Water pressure in bathroom was quite good, but lighting terrible.  Take time to have dinner in restaurant.  Pizza is excellent as they have pizza ovens that brown a crust just right.  No spa on premises or nearby.  But the indoor pool is large and the fitness center is superb.  A variety of machines.  Techo beat music was way too loud.  Would have enjoyed my time in the center if it had been just quiet and I could have listened to my own music.  Free wifi through all of hotel. No hidden fees.",4,2015,07,09
249,"Not much to recommend this property, except price","I'm a bit surprised by the generally positive reviews for this hotel.  Honestly, I was expecting more.  It's convenient for visitors with their own cars (property is just off the Ring Road, look for a free parking space near the entrance of the lot before paying your 5 euros for pay parking).  But that's about all it has going for it.  An old, sprawling property whose best days were clearly in the past.  Popular among budget and mid-priced tour groups -- as it should be (generic, large affordable chain hotel).  Room comfort would be slightly below a typical Comfort Inn in the USA, and no free breakfast.  I used my Choice Rewards points for my stay, and it was a good value that way, but I don't think I would have been satisfied paying the going rate for a room.  I would think there would be better places to stay.",3,2015,07,09
249,Very good hotel,"Stayed here with friends for a long weekend break. The hotel is very good, with everything you could need. Very nice rooms with everything you would expect plus iron and ironing board. Free, fast wifi throughout the hotel. Good bar with nice food. Prices for food and drink very reasonable. Good Italian restaurant plus an Asian restaurant that we didn't get round to using. A coffe bar in reception serves excellent coffee and pastries - good if you don't fancy full breakfast in the restaurant. It as nice to go and get a takeaway coffee early in the morning and take it back to the room. The hotel also has a nice pool/sauna/gym. 
The hotel is a 5 to 10 minute stroll from the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which is fairly large and has all the main shops, food outlets and a cinema.
The bus stop is a 10 minute stroll with plenty of buses to take you straight into the centre of Dublin (15 minutes on bus at 2.80 euros)
A good location if you don't want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the city centre. I would stay here again.",5,2015,07,09
249,Great modern place convenient to Dublin and main roads.,Good modern hotel with great facility. Really enjoyed the swimming pool and steam room.  Evening meal at the in-house Italian Restaurant was very enjoyable and a good price (Shane was our waiter - he was a star!) Live music in the bar was great fun.  Accommodation was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable.  Staff were all welcoming and helpful.  Convenient to the city.  Would visit again.,4,2015,07,08

249,Family break,"Pleasant welcome from the staff, rooms very clean and spacios food fabulous,very good location next to shopping centre.Enjoyed the stay
The only thing I did not like was to pay for parking, if the hotel management can look into the parking issue it will be great.

249,Family Break,"We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel, our room was great, the facilities were perfect and plenty to keep our 3 year old daughter entertained.  The food in the Italian restaurant was fabulous, but the service was really slow, on both nights we waited long periods of time between courses.  But overall we had a great time.

249,Nearly ripped off,"This would have been a positive review except for one thing. I booked a room at a price of E79 and when I checked in I decided to pay our bill in advance with my Euro debit card. I handed my card over to the receptionist and he passed the terminal to me showing £85 sterling( equivalent of E115 approx.)  and asked did I want to pay Euro or £. Now, I am 72 years old and I sincerely hope that he was not trying it on because of that but I had my wits about me and paid the original Euro price.",3,2015,07,08
249,Love this place,"I visit Dublin a lot for family and always compare prices before I book my hotel and the Clarion always ends up being the cheapest, and the service is just seamless. All the staff can't do enough for you, the rooms are always so clean and the place is gorgeously decorated. Can't say a bad word about it. They're so good with food allergies/intolerances too, they have signage next to each food station at breakfast defining each dish and the corresponding allergens. Will be coming again soon, thank you for always making me feel so welcome.",5,2015,07,07

Our room was spotless...breakfast was grand. We were up for the AC/DC concert with our two boys...12 and 15 so our room was perfect. Leisure centre facilities were also spot on and the girl on the desk there was also super nice...can't fault it in fairness.,5,2015,07,07

249,Wonderful stay,"We have just returned home today from a wonderful 3 night stay in clarion Liffey valley, the stay was excellent value  3 nights stay with breakfasts, one dinner and pass to the zoo. The dinner in Gustos was absolutely beautiful and the lady who served us Sandra was amazing. The breakfast was lovely and very well organised. We were 3 families totalling 6 adults and 6 children and were given rooms beside each other for convenience. The reception staff, waiting staff and restaurant staff were all as pleasant and courteous as the next. I will definitely be staying again in the future. The only down side was that there was no a/c but fans were provided in each room so every effort was made to ensure guest comfort.",5,2015,07,05
249,Excellent stay at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,"Very nice hotel with extremely comfortable rooms...the bed was great and we enjoyed the relaxation facilities too.

A big thumb up from us!!!

249,Overall good stay,"We stayed at this hotel last night, myself, my husband and 6 year old daughter, just for one night, we had visited Dublin Zoo for our daughters birthday. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite.  We were very impressed with the size and condition of the suite and we wished we had been staying longer to take advantage of it.  Our daughter was to have a folding bed in the living room but she did'nt want to sleep in there by herself so she ended up in the bed with us which was not ideal.  Another drawback was that the suite is on the edge of the hotel complex (where the playground is) right beside a bar and nightclub (not part of the hotel) we were woken up around 3am by a right racket when it was kicking out time from the nightclub.  Also the adults swimming pool was closed, it seemed to be something to do with tiles that had come off the floor of the pool.  The kids pool was still open so our daughter got a swim so we got away without an upset.  We did get complimentary parking (usually 5 euros) to make up for the pool closure.  The breakfast was the usual buffet that you get at hotels and was of a high standard, and the service was efficient.  The restaurant was busy but we were lucky we got there before a large queue had formed.  In the evening we ate at a restaurant at the shopping mall near to the hotel.  In summary we would stay at this hotel again, but would prefer a room away from the nightclub.",4,2015,07,05
249,Fab Family Break,"Just back from short break with 2 young boys. Clarion Liffey Valley great location for visiting amenities in city and wider Dublin area. Hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. Goutos food and staff were fab. All good value. Perfect hotel for families with kids club, movies and play areas. The only thing missing is air con in rooms. But this did not upset things really- this is Ireland! Def will return. Thanks a mil to all. ",5,2015,07,04
249,BRILLIANT,"This hotel was very reasonble for what we payed including tayto park tickets and breakfast both mornings. From the time we checked in until the time we checked out there was not one problem with anything. You couldn't fault the staff, they were very friendly. we will definitely be staying here again and I would 100% recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to dublin or tayto park. close to city, 20mins from tayto park. EXCELLENT SERVICE
      ",5,2015,07,04
249,Fabulous experience,"Only stayed one night but was so happy to find out they upgraded my room, we ended up with a suite, sitting roon, kitchenette, bedroom and bathroom with a lovely lobby area separating all the rooms. The hotel was hot but the room even had 2 electric fans and even better 2 televisions. Breakfast next morning was very good eat as much as
you want. It is a bit out of the city but i think that is good. The public transport is more than adequate for anyones needs.
i would highly recommend a stay to anyone",5,2015,07,03
249,Great hotel for families ,"We stayed in the clarion hotel recently while visiting Dublin zoo. This is a great hotel for families. Our little girl loved the pool & we have to say that it is one of the nicest children's pools we've seen in a hotel. The only one thing we did think was a little strange was they only allow children's floats between 3pm & 5pm, she was a little disappointed when it was taken off her as she was having great fun with it. Honestly the breakfast was not the best we've had, some of the food was a little over cooked but it was okay. We have to say that out of all of the hotels we've stayed in the staff were one of the friendliest. Overall we had a great stay & will return again.",4,2015,07,03
249,Dirty Rooms and not child freindly,"We picked this hotel because of the location and great price.....NEVER AGAIN.  We had two you kids with us - 5 & 4 and we were staying in a family room for two nights.  It was beyond roasting in the room and their solution to that was a fan that was noisy so the kids couldn't get to sleep.  There was rubbish in the room and a dirty nappy under the bed - disgusting.  We phoned reception to tell them about it and we were told it would be removed - it never was.  In the end we had to dispose of it.  

The queue was huge for breakfast and when we finally did get there the food was terrible.

The lobby seems to be an extension of the bar so there was lots of people drinking there well into the night as we could hear them from our floor, and it just didn't seem a safe environment to have kids.

When you add all this up although it was cheap it is not value for money.  Having to clean a room before you let your kids into it is a joke and on the second morning although we had paid for breakfast we went elsewhere so our kids could get nice food.

The only plus was it's location - it was easy to get away from it and do other stuff.

BEST PART - CHECKING OUT",1,2015,07,03
249,Concert visit,"Location of this hotel is excellent and very easy to find. Also we were able to book shuttle to and from concert in 3Arena which was excellent. Unfortunately, the weather was very warm and no Air-con!",3,2015,07,03
249,Very Relaxing,"When we arrived the girl on the front desk very friendly indeed we were no time getting booked in. Our room was perfect fine and big and a nice table and chairs and a kettle  for a nice cup of tea and relax. the bathroom was also big with a toilet wash basin and a walk in shower.The liffey Valley shopping centre was only a couple of minutes away.
We had a fine breakfast and there was staff everywhere and very pleasant.",5,2015,07,03
249,Very Friendly and Accommodating,"A good travel from the airport, very efficient and friendly hotel staff. Evan at the Cafe Bar in the Lobby provides excellent service, it was an overall good experience at a reasonable price, rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had very nice weather, hottest day of the year while we were here, rooms have no A/C so a bit warm, windows and patio doors to balcony provided some relief.",4,2015,07,02
249,Brilliant,"This hotel,is awesome, great for families or business, Liffey Valley shopping centre 2 minute drive or 10 minute walk, great shops and restaurants there.the breakfast was brilliant so much choice, the rooms were comfortable but lack aircon, this is only an issue if your room faces the sun otherwise the rooms are cool any way. The restaurants and bar serve great food and beer at reasonable prices. The snag is the pool, we didn't swim because the rule is swim caps must be worn, so it's not our custom to do so. When we went to look at the pool no one was wearing swim caps so we told the girl on the desk in the fitness centre, she was quite rude in her response and then kicked everyone out of the pool.",5,2015,07,02
249,Clarion,Every staff member we met was warm and welcoming.  We had a one year old baby with us and found the hotel very suitable for travel with an infant.  The swimming pool was lovely (although the swimming hats were a bit pricey).,4,2015,07,01
249,Warning: Thieves operate in the parking lot,"The room and food were good but there was a charge to park my vehicle in the safety of the car park at the front of there hotel. Well worth it for the peace of mind, or so I thought, but when I got up the next morning to go to work it had been broken into. Luckily there was not one but two cctv cameras, one either side of my vehicle. I reported the break in immediately to the hotel staff who said they'd check the cameras. I had to get to work so I left it with them and they said they'd get back to me.

After several days of not hearing from them I called the hotel and spoke to a manager who said they hadn't bothered to check the tapes yet but when they did they would pass it on to the Gardaí and be in touch. That was 2 whole months ago and I still haven't heard back from them, not even an apology, never mind reimbursement.

I work and stay in Dublin regularly but won't be staying here again.",2,2015,06,30

Room was a good size and clean as usual.  We did not eat in main restaurant but in the Kudos Thai restaurant.  Food was only okay on this occasion.  Main restaurant has been renovated and looks nice.  Hotel also has nice swimming pool and Spa facilities.

It is located 15-20 mins from Dublin City center and Dublin Airport.  Some watchouts for the management are that in the hotel corridors, the walls could do with painting and the chairs in the Kudos restaurant are showing wear and tear and could do with replacing.

I will though be back to this hotel given its location and general good service and comfort.",4,2015,06,26

249,Good but nothing remarkable,"Good enough for a big, chain hotel, but nothing remarkable. On arrival I was upgraded from a room to an apartment and the place was really spacious and comfortable. Cleanliness adequate but not sparkling or shining. Location is in the middle of pretty much nowhere - suits me fine 'cause it's close to a work location and has easy access to the airport by car, but wouldn't do much for people visiting Dublin. Where the hotel somewhat fails is customer care and amenities - there were no toiletries provided, apart from a wall mounted Dove's hand soap, and after repeated calls to Reception another Dove's shampoo+shower gel arrived. There was no conditioner, body lotion, tooth paste, cotton buds, tooth brushes, slippers, shower caps, absolutely nothing. After a while the Receptionist managed to secure us shower caps and slippers, a feat on his part indeed. Parking is charged, which is rather unreasonable given the middle-of-nowhere location and being across Liffey Valley. Overall an okay experience given the lovely apartment that overall however does not seem value for money.",3,2015,06,22

I took my friend for her 21st birthday and I decided to stay out of the city centre a bit to save some money and I'm really glad I did! it is a 20euro taxi into the city centre but bus's run every 10min and they are cheap! The room was lovely very spacious with a huge mirror which is obviously perfect for two 21 year olds! They also kept the rooms very clean. We used the pool facilities (you need a swimming hat to go in the pool) the hot tub and sauna are lovely! The only down side for us was the restaurant the steak was expensive and they didn't know how to cook it! Don't let that put you off just eat else where!!!,4,2015,06,21
249,Very poor hotel,"Bad experience in all areas. Too many beds in the room. Poor customer relations. Expect you to pay without opportunity to check the bill. Breakfast poor. Accused of not paying for dinner when we had in fact signed the bill.

The adult pool is a great size and the childrens pool is large also. My boys love coming here.
Breakfasts are great with plenty to offer. It even has an outdoor secured playground!!!

My family cannot fault this hotel and we stay on average 2/3 times a year (should have loyalty programme)

It is positioned so well close to N4, N7 and M50 and right beside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and Cinema so you have plenty of activities and restaurants choices and with a 10 min walk to bus stop into town.",5,2015,06,21
249,regular visitor,"Have visited this hotel multiple times and enjoy its facilities and location, very handy for a family with children and the staff are fairly good. Only real problem we has was there was 3 of us and room only had towels mugs glasses etc for 2 people, rang reception to request more twice and was told stuff for a third person would be brought to our room, this never arrived, even after I rang back a second time. Another suggestion we would have for the hotel is to be able to offer decaff coffee as we had a diabetic woman with us on holiday who had to go out and buy her own and when she did buy the coffee again it took several requests for a pot of hot water at breakfast to actually get it. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, very comfortable and clean rooms, great pool and spa facilities

249,Birthday weekend,"The Liffey Valley hotel was excellent for my weekend stay. The room for 3 people was great and of a very high standard. The staff throughout the hotel were fantastic and extremely helpful.

Breakfast was very good and the evening meal we had was of an excellent standard. 10 out of 10 for a great day.

249,OK place to stay,"Warn around the edges (marks on ceiling from previous leaks)
Crowded - no spare room to move you to when room given was unacceptable
Management Staff - so so - not delivering on what they committed to.",3,2015,06,18
249,Booked for family,Book the hotel for my parents & my partners parents as we did not have enough room for them to stay . . Good value @ €89 for a double room . . Both sets of parents enjoyed their stay & slept well .. Dealing with reservations was straight forward & easy . . Very polite efficient staff members . .,4,2015,06,18
249,"Room was too noisy, too hot, and not very clean","Room was too noisy, too hot, and not very clean, we asked at the restaurant for room service just after 10 and we were told to phone four star pizza for delivery. Room was too expensive for one nighbdghd

249,Week working in Dublin,"I spent the week in the hotel on business and I can only say that the staff were impeccable. From the restaurant staff to the maintenance staff, each one was friendly and chatty. The manager responsible for employing such a high calibre of staff should be accredited for doing such a great job. There are numerous 5* operations in Ireland and abroad that should visit the hotel and observe how the team in the Clarion engaged with all of the guests in a meaningful  and genuine manner. 
Well done !!!",5,2015,06,15
249,DO NOt stay at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,"The website for this hotel is misleading, if not an outright lie. It says, ""Free access to our uncontended 100MB Wi-Fi Internet access."" It was actually ""free"" but for only 15 minutes, per room, per day. In my opinion, that is not ""free access"" to the Internet. Another sentence on their website say, ""We offer free WiFi."" Do not be fooled by this face advertising.

Their website also says that the breakfast is included. When we got there, we were told that the full breakfast was NOT free because we booked our room on-line using Choice previlage points. Only the continental breakfast was free. The small print on their website at the bottom the page says, ""Charge for Full Breakfast."" We paid for the full buffet breakfast one morning. It was the worst breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. The free continental breakfast was also very bad. The other three mornings, we drove to a nearby shoping center and ate breakfast at McDonalds.

There was no air-conditioning in our room. There was one small fan and the staff gave us another fan when we asked for one.",1,2015,06,15
249,Great hotel,Great location. Easy to access from M50 have stayed here several times. They have miplaced my booking a few times and always upgraded us for the  inconvience. Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a great hotel.,4,2015,06,14
249,Customer Service in Restaurant,I have stayed here many times and I always love the service. Everyone is so helpful and friendly. Sharon in particular is brilliant in the restaurant. She is a natural with customers and always makes them feel welcome. People like her are a huge asset to the Hotel.,5,2015,06,11
249,Best hotel we.ve stayed in!,"Just home from a 4 night package with Tatyo and Zoo. Had  a 2, 5 and 7 year old with us. 
Receptionist ""Martina"" met us on arrival and so welcoming and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for her. Any hotel would be blessed to have her.
The rest of the staff are also friendly and accomodating.
 
Rooms perfect for children. Filtered water, safe, good sized fridge, free wifi and games room all were a bonus.

Breakfast good choice. Lovely lady called ""Binta"" in restaurant made us feel at home every morning. 

Shopping centre 2 mins drive and McDonalds near by.
Had our evening meal in the onsite restaurant. Adults and kids all 3 courses- food really good.

2 pools including a kids pool with good height and kids able to stay in till 7pm.

All in all a lovely 4night package. Hoping all to return next year.",5,2015,06,10
249,Great location,"I stayed for two nights as I was attending a conference in the hotel and I also had meetings to attend to during the day so it was convenient for me. The hotel is really clean and staff seem very attentive and on the ball. After check in we were looked after in the restaurant by a very efficient girl called Sharon.The menu selection and price was very good as was the presentation. My room was really nice, absolutely spotless with very modern decor and the beds were really comfortable. Breakfast was busy and there was a bit of a wait to be seated, Robert the manager was very apologetic and the quality of the breakfast especially a super fresh cup of coffee was worth the wait, a great start to the day. Overall very satisfied.",4,2015,06,05
249,"Brilliant Value, Amazing Food.","Stayed here for 1 night. The room we booked was huge, which was quite surprising. We had asked for a quiet room if possible, as we had our 9 month old with us. The room we were given met our request. 

The facilities provided in room were great - plenty of tea and coffee, and the Television was modern, with plenty of selection in channels.

The highlight of the stay was our meal at the Italian Restaurant (there's both an Asian and Italian Restaurants on site). I've never had such a nice experience eating out in a hotel. The food was simply fantastic, and best of all, with 4 courses, drinks, and a baby bowl for the 9 month old, came to less that €100.00.

If i have occasion to stay in Dublin again, I will be headed here!",4,2015,06,05
249,"Good facilities, but a few negative points too","I've stayed here several days a week for months now for work and I think it has pretty much all you would want from a hotel: good choice of restaurants, good (free) wifi, gym, swimming pool, spa and friendly staff. The rooms are a good size too. 

However, its not quite as good as it could be. While the rooms are clean, they are a little run down; some of the beds need replacing, showers need new heads etc. Many of the rooms have connecting doors which is great for families but it means you can hear pretty much everything going on in the next room if you happen to be in one. There's also quite a lot of noise from either the car park or the motorway right next to the hotel.

Its about a 25 euro cab ride into Dublin centre too which isn't so good.

Overall it's a decent enough hotel but with room for improvement.",3,2015,06,04
249,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel! The staff were really friendly and the facilities were really good. The room we had was really clean and had some nice toiletries. Had a fridge and tea coffee making etc. The swimming pool was busy but nice. Breakfast had a good selection of hot and cold food and although it was busy in the restaurant  staff were on hand to help and the buffet was kept well stocked. It was a nice day so we were able to sit outside - bonus! Will certainly use this hotel again
      ",5,2015,06,04
249,Food not good,"Besides the fact they brought out the wrong food, it's really not that good at all!  I would suggest trying to have your food before you get to the hotel.  The hotel itself it generally clean, but there are areas that need maintaining, like ripped carpet, broken tiles etc.  the last time we stayed here they didn't charge for residents parking either, now €5 per night...",1,2015,06,04
249,What a nice place,"We had a great weekend in April in the Clarion. It was easy to locate & parking was easy. We got checked in quickly & were given an adults only floor which was great for us. We came to  relax which we were able to do. We stayed 3 nights. From once that we checked in, all the staff were friendly & helpful. The room was lovely and the bathroom was spotless. Breakfast was great. A good selection of foods to cater for everyone's taste buds. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to all our friends. The only thing that was missing was some Irish normal food on the evening menu but there were places near by to eat. Not everyone likes Italian or Asian food",5,2015,06,04
249,Ok hotel barely a 4 star though,Stayed for one night. Everything was OK. A little different to the other two clarion that I've stayed in so don't expect the same. A little bit worn but will definitely do the job. Breakfast was very average though.,3,2015,06,04
249,Terrible tea and scones at training event ,"Attended a training events here, and while on the surface, everything was lovely and presentation was lovely, the quality of the food was poor. Tea and scones were provided upon arrival, which I think were sitting in the room for a long time. The tea tasted terrible, did not resemble tea at all. The scones tasted stale and hard. They provided sparking water, which was nice. The lunch was ok, but I was quite wary of it, based on my experience of the quality of the tea and scones. ",2,2015,06,04
249,LOVELY HOTEL & STAFF,"Stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley Hotel 24th June - 26th June, first thing I will say which was a massive negative is that its not directly on a bus route and the nearest stop is a 15min walk which wasn't good uphill with suitcases, however, when we got there check in was easy and pleasant staff, there was 4 of us in a family room (they allow 4 adults) as it was my daughters hen weekend, they gave us all a key card, we had to keep getting them re keyed though as they stopped working, they said it was because we must of had them near our mobiles, but I know I didn't. The room was your average similar to premier inn etc, nice but not luxury.  It was clean and well maintained. Breakfast was lovely and a very wide choice of cooked and continental which was included in the price, I have to say that we got the room very cheap so wasn't expecting much so it exceeded my expectations from the price point of view. we never ate at the hotel apart from the breakfast so cant comment on those.  The swimming pool/steam room etc was really nice also and pretty quiet when we were there.  There is a shopping mall approx 10/15 min walk away from the hotel which has quite a lot of shops and food outlets. We had done miles and miles of walking the first day so decided to get a taxi from the hotel to the mall but be warned, if you book it off hotel phone it costs more as we were charged 10euro there (not even 1/2 mile away) and when we got one back from the mall it cost 7.50euro. check out took less than 2 mins so very good there. So to sum up, yes lovely hotel but if you are not hiring a car or prepared to pay for taxis everywhere be prepared for lots of walking.  If you are getting around on the bus however, you can buy a tourist pass at the airport for 19.50euro which lasts 72 hours and can be used on bus/train/tram, just not the hop on hop off tourist bus.  You also need to get 2 buses to get to the hotel from Dublin airport.",4,2015,05,29
249,"Clarion Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","This is a lovely hotel about 15 minutes from the airport and roughly 15 minutes from Dublin.  There is a large mall within walking distance . The hotel has a beautiful swimming pool, separate children's pool, whirlpool, steam room and sauna.  There is an air conditioned gym with a lot of equipment.  The rooms are large with free wifi, cable TV, telephone and a lovely desk.",5,2015,05,27
249,Great coffee!,"Evan at the coffee dock make a GREAT cappuccino! Definitely recommend.
We were there for swimming classes, and stopped off (just beside reception) to get a takeaway coffee. Evan was friendly and a great barista!",4,2015,05,27
249,Ignorant Staff,"I stayed here with a large group on Saturday, May 23rd for my sisters birthday party which was held at the hotel. Everything was going very smoothly until we went to use the residents bar we were told would be available to us.  The person who called himself firstly the Manager and then changed it to The Night Officer was beyond rude to all of our party and refused to open the bar as there was no demand.  We were a party of over 30, how many does it require? The security staff were even astonished at this mans behaviour towards us as we were more than polite. So to you Ismar, I would like to say, thank you for leaving a bad taste in everyone's mouth after your rude, ignorant behaviour towards us.  Maybe you should adapt the attitude that without the clientele there would be no hotel.  It was very disappointing for my sister to end her celebrations of a very special birthday with your attitude....  I will certainly not stay at this hotel again!!!!",1,2015,05,26
249,Never again!,"My wife and my self were staying as we were at a wedding in Dublin. Check in was fine and that's the only good thing I can say about the hotel. 

We stayed in the hotel for two nights. When we got to the room it was boiling went to turn on the  air con. Oh wait they have none..... In a four star hotel?? Yep but they kindly supply you with a fan that just blows hot air around. But hey we opened the window.

 Unpacked all our clothes and as we were doing so found an empty peanut butter jar above the safe. Along with that there some chocolates left on the floor. Now I'm all for hotels giving you a mint on your pillow or some flowers. But this was a new one for us. 

The next day we went down for breakfast and we were greeted and brought to a table.  A filthy table. Thankfully we were told that if we went and got out breakfast it would be cleaned when we got back. And hopefully the other tables around it would be cleared too. 

We got our breakfast and yay table was cleaned. Well... I say cleaned. They replaced the coffee cups with dirty ones and the same with the glasses. 

I brought one of the dirty glasses to reception as the ""manager"" of the resturante was no where to be seen. I was left for 15 min before some one eventually showed up. 

The lady apologised which is fine. But then mentioned that the same thing happened the previous day too...... Hmmm good to see that the previous complaint was taken seriously 

 The bed was comfortable. And that's really what matters that's the whole point of a hotel.  I don't mind a dirty room in a budget hotel or bad service in a budget hotel. You get what you pay for. 

But at four star prices this shouldn't happen. We stayed in this hotel a few years ago and it was brilliant. Hence our return visit. But unfortunately in that time frame it turned from a good hotel into a badly run bnb in the guise of a hotel. 

Spend your money somewhere else",1,2015,05,26
249,Not Really Bothered!!,"My Family had a recent occasion to stay here and we are disturbed about how casual our complaints were handled. It is simply not good enough.First off , we specifically asked for a quiet room, this was denied and the room was near reception, so no good nights sleep here! Secondly , the purpose of our visit to Dublin 22 was put to question in an abrupt and somewhat crude manner! Again, simply not good enough. Then when a complaint was made, the blame was cast on Staff Training, again, simply not good enough! We are very regular Hotel users in the capital, but will definitely be giving this one a future wide berth. Not much more to say!",2,2015,05,26
249,"Terrible Service, unclean room","I stayed last night, and every encounter with the staff was unpleasant. I complained about the restaurant service, having waited for 90 minutes for my meal, and was told that's how long it takes to cook a steak. The bar staff were slow and impolite, and the carpet, cushions and furniture in my room were stained. The bathroom was grotty and the decor was generally shabby and tired. I will certainly not be going back.",1,2015,05,26
249,Great hotel,"We stayed last night for an early hospital appointment in crumlin and have stayed before for buisness and was very impressed.a lovely receptionist called lucia helped me with info,taxi booking and a late checkout and another lovely gusto staff member called sharon was so welcoming,helpful and sweet.the leisure centre was great with more helpful friendly staff.great food in gusto and childrens play area on ground floor.might request upper floor next time just because of outside noise but not hotels fault.good sevice deserves respect and i will stay again next month for conveinence to the city and i believe if u book in advance you can get special rates.",4,2015,05,21
249,Perfect for our trip,"We stayed there for one night, we went for my daughters graduation closeby. It was all we wanted, super room, convenient location, very helpful staff. Great comfortable bed. Best place to stay for shopping at Liffey Valley.",5,2015,05,20
249,Great location ,"We stayed here for 1 night the night of my daughters communion we came up from kells, co meath, so it was ideal not too far away. The man on reception was v helpful (can't remember his name) and the hotel is nice & modern. Our room was v comfortable & spotless clean. This trip was just about the kids having a good time so we drove 10 mins to blanchardstown to the leisure plex for bowling etc, and the next day went to liffey valley shopping centre which is close to the hotel, 2/3 min drive so u could walk to it, to pirates village. This was a lovely shopping centre & pirates village is great for all age kids, with bouncy castles, paddle boats, trampolining etc . Breakfast was buffet style with plenty to choose from, there was the usual full irish, cereals etc & everything was hot not luke warm as it can be at buffets. We would definitely recommend this hotel & will return in the future.",5,2015,05,20
249,Clarion,"The good: The rooms overall are clean and fairly good sized. Beds are comfortable, & nice bathroom. The restaurants food are average. I loved the cafe and Evan was very friendly, professional and greeted me with a big smile each day!  (handsome too). 

The ""bad"": I wasn't too impressed with two of the front desk staff. Feels like they've been in the industry for too long and forgot how important first impressions and hospitality really is. It's 20 minutes from the city and not to accessible...",4,2015,05,20
249,Excellent!,"We stayed here for our First Year Wedding Anniversary, it was lovely. We got upgraded for free to a suite. Husband had arranged for roses, prosecco, petals on the bed which was all done lovely. We had to wait a while for our room but we didn't mind, we waited in the bar which was nice and cosy. On our last night we ate in Kudos, it was fantastic, I had the 'Best Curry Ever' and it really was!! Husband thought the shower was a bit small. I can't wait to go back and bring our kids, lots of different dining options, a toddler area, a teenage area, pool, kitchenette in suite, staff are so friendly and helpful, seemed very welcoming to children also.",5,2015,05,19
249,Super Hotel with great Staff!,"I was on a business trip to Dublin just after Easter and decided to take my family with me to visit the relatives in Ireland over Easter and then stay the rest of the week in Dublin. I was looking for a hotel that would ensure my 14 year old son and 16 year old daughter would not get bored which meant a hotel with a swimming pool. The Clarion is very much a family hotel and we booked two rooms on Hotels.com and contacted the hotel to ensure they would be on the same floor preferably next to each other. We were given two rooms with interlocking doors so that was already a great start. The hotel is in Liffey Valley with a great shopping centre in walking distance, cinema etc etc. We were with car so getting into Dublin was easy especially since it was still the Easter holidays so traffic was kind but I believe there is also a good bus service.

I would highly recommend the hotel for anyhow who is looking to stay near Dublin and has family, as a business traveler alone you might find the hotel a bit too much but again it was holiday time.

There are a few remarks with regard to the mattresses on other review but all I can say they are excellent, they are firm but not rock hard, I personally hate mattresses that are soft and give little support!",5,2015,05,19
249,"45 minutes away from Dublin City Centre, Otherwise Nice Hotel","The Clarion Hotel in Liffey Valley itself is a nice hotel. The rooms are big and everything is clean and high quality, much nicer than any hotel of equal price in the City Centre. However, for those traveling to Dublin, be aware that this hotel is at least a 45 minute bus ride away from the Dublin City Centre. We took the 40 bus every day to and from O'Connell street and our commute round trip took an hour and a half, which cut into our activities quite a bit. The only other option for transportation is to take a cab, which is approximately 30 to 35 euros one way. Overall it should be a good experience at the Clarion in Liffey Valley as long as you are aware of the commute.",3,2015,05,19
249,Lovely Hotel with exceptional customer service,"On arrival we were treated by Linda on reception who really made us feel welcome. Linda helped us with arranging our airport transfer for the next day and even came to find us in the hotel bar to confirm the taxi booking. Best customer service I have ever experienced in a Hotel. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. 
Our room was spacious, clean and beds very comfortable. The room was well-presented and offered all amenities. 
We dined in the Hotel restaurant- Gusto and enjoyed the delicious pizzas on offer, as well as other dishes. Service was very good and meals were very tasty and great value. 
The hotel offers a fitness centre area including pool, steam room and spa. The spa was fabulous after our day of travelling and the facility crew were friendly and informative. 
We will definitely be staying at the Clarion on our return to Dublin. ",5,2015,05,18
249,Fantastic hotel with friendly staff,"I very much enjoyed my stay here in the hotel. Everything form the warm welcome at breakfast by a lady supervisor who's name was Aafke. She had a warm welcome and smile and walked me to my table and was just fantastic and made me feel very welcome. Also the very friendly waiter who served me coffee at lunch time, his name was Evan and couldn't be more friendly also. He was nice and chatty and also had a lovely smile on his face. 
The beds where very comfortable and the shower in the room was out of this world amazing! The wifi was some of the fastest internet I've ever used. Dinner was delicious, I am a chef so I appreciate good food. Would and will stay here again.",5,2015,05,18
249,Much better than expected.,"Clearly a very busy hotel but efficient enough at both check in and check out. Stayed for 2 nights and the rooms very large and clean. Underground car park was very handy. Great rate too and very easy transport connections as close to the motor way and main road into Central Dublin. Didn't eat in the hotel but a great choice of restaurants in the local area. Overall a very pleasurable experience, would definitely come back when visiting family again.",5,2015,05,17
249,Great place!,"Great staff!! All very helpful and pleasant. Food was ok! It was nice but not amazing. Bar Staff were fantastic. Very professionally run and management have a very nice aura about them. 

Would definitely recommend it! Meeting rooms were a bit tight just more thought in layout required 

",5,2015,05,17
249,Fabulous,"We stayed here mid April for a girly weekend away.  We were not disappointed. Lovely hotel, lovely staff, lovely city.  The staff couldn't do enough for us, very helpful, very friendly, very professional.  Easy to get into Dublin city centre and a stones throw away from a shopping complex just a 5 minute stroll away. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.  I look forward to returning.",5,2015,05,17
249,Fantastic,What can I say. This hotel is the best my wife and I have stayed in. We had a great surprise when we got checked in by Neil. We got a free upgrade to the executive suite. The room was spotless and very large. There was a small kitchenette a living room area a massive comfortable king size bed. The toilet was big as well. The shower was great. People say in here they never had room service. There are cards on the door asking if you want your room cleaned use them. We had breakfast twice on our two night stay. What a fantastic selection from a full English to continental breakfast spoilt for choice. Our first night we went to The Arc restaurant which was reasonably priced and great food. Liffey Valley shopping centre is a 5-10 min walk. It's worth a visit as well large selection of shops and restaurants as well. If you are traveling from the airport use the airport hopper its €13 return per person a taxi is €30 one way. It only takes 25-30 mins depending on traffic. If you are going to Dublin city centre the bus stop is a 8-12min walk from the hotel. Head towards the  Giraffe day care walk past it walk over the foot bridge and busses are regular. We spent a full day in Dublin and soaked up the local atmosphere    When I return to Dublin in the future there's only one place where I'll be staying is here I would highly recommend it to famil and friends and who ever else reads this review. Keep up the good work guys 👍,5,2015,05,16
249,"Ok, and perhaps even good!","We spent 5 nights in a family room which was good value for money. Reception and booking does a wonderful job and are very friendly, breakfast room busy but the buffet contains all you need. Lots of space and good comfort but bring dishwasher tablets, napkins, paper and all other things you need if you plan to use the kitchen. Housekeeping visited just once during Monday-Friday week and changed only the towels,perhaps this is normal.
Recommended if you come by car, if not, nearest shopping center is 20 min walk and buses,hmm works but a lot of walking, Leap card purchase. Remember this us close to a motor way.
There is a great bar, Kudos un the komplex, with fantastic service and great food.
My thanks also to the friendly guy in the liquer store next to it.",4,2015,05,15
249,Efficient Commercial Hotel,"Large commercial hotel convenient to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre 
Good Parking , 2 restaurants. . Nice selection of Italian dishes in Gusto . Very good Pizzas from oven.  Good leisure complex with large pool , sauna , steam room etc. avoid 3/430 pm kids lessons in pool 
Bars are major disappointment . Like a airport dept lounge Soul less.",3,2015,05,15
249,The good and the bad and the super friendly,"I took a group here on a tour and it started less than promising as 2 rooms weren't booked despite the tour company confirming the booking the day before and despite me calling the day before to make sure the booking was okay and to confirm. The staff at reception were very friendly though and sorted it out, The rooms are basic but clean.
I was put in one of the apartments which was excellent for me as a guide, but the guests' rooms were much more basic. Very good for the price but not entirely to some of the guests' taste. The banqueting room for dinner was set for more people than expected and booked for but they sorted it out. Food is good, but not outstanding. The staff is absolutely brilliant though and work very hard and they are some of the friendliest around. They make the place and are what drives it. Would gladly stay here again, but I do feel it could be run a wee bit better.",3,2015,05,14
249,Cafe in Hotel,"Each time I visit this hotel Evan, the barista, always has a smile on his face and is more than happy to do whatever he can to accommodate you.  Plus he makes excellent teas and coffees and always has a great selcetion of delicious baked good to choose from.",4,2015,05,13
249,birthday,"Had a terrible experience .staff messing up with our dinner reservation, very poor service left waiting eventhough we had booked the restaurant the day before in reception and with restaurant but they said they had no details, we had booked for 10 guest to turn up for a 40th birthday party. Had to ask several times for tea and coffee, left waiting had asked for the cake to be brought out twice, staff were more concerned about cleaning 
up than serving guests.  it was so terrible for my wife to be let down, it spoilt the whole night, the food was not up to standard or hotel, We would not stay there again even if it was for free .I would advise not to stay there, we had stayed in plenty of hotels in the past but this was worst .",1,2015,05,10
249,Unmitigated Disaster,"Stayed here on 24th & 25th April 2015 with my husband.  We paid €150.00 for a double room on a B & B basis with Roomex.com.  The 1st problem was the huge delay in getting to the check-in desk and the fact that we were in the way of people entering/leaving the hotel, guests who were passing through the lobby & people who were attending interviews upstairs.  There were 3 receptionists on duty when we first arrived but 2 subsequently left.  When we were eventually dealt with, the actual check-in by Linda was very efficient. We were allocated room 244 on the ground floor which was very comfortable and spacious but which we later discovered, to our detriment, was located in the family area of the hotel, with a toddler & teen zone at the end of our bedroom block.  Both rooms adjacent to us & those opposite were occupied by guests which young children, some of which woke several times during the night, another was violently ill & most were awake and moving around very early, which is understandable but we didn't get much sleep on either night of or stay.  I realise that this isn't the hotel's fault but it was obvious that we weren't travelling wih children and I believe that we shouldn't have been allocated accommodation in that part of the hotel.  If this really was the only available room then we could at least have been advised to expect some disturbances.  We found the bar staff to be quite abrupt and a simple request for the cocktail menu turned into a major job as it took ages for one to be located.  The biggest problem though as breakfast - the tables for 2 are far too close together and guests were unable to leave their seats without brushing against the neighbouring tables, which was very embarrasing.  The quality of the food was adequate but well below what I expect from a 4 star hotel in terms of choice and quality.  There was a lot of staff on duty but there didn't seem to be any clear direction as to who was responsible for what.  Items that were used up were not replaced quickly and special orders (e.g. poached eggs) took ages to arrive as there were no table numbers and staff were going around in circles looking for the person who placed the order - MAYHEM!   We had to ask for coffee 3 times on Saturday moring before it eventually arrived, I asked for brown soda bread, to be told there wasn't any and on Sunday morning my husband ordered 2 fried eggs, which never arrived.  I did expect when checking out to be asked if everything was o.k. but I wasn't given that opportunity.   I have since e-mailed the hotel but haven't had the courtesy of a reply.  The positive things are (a) comfortable room (b) secure underground car-parking at a very reasonable rate of €5 overnight (c) good value for hotel accommodation in Dublin on Friday & Saturday night (d) on-site Leisure Centre & (e) convenient for Dublin Airport as the Airport Hopper stops just outside reception .   This hotel always gets good reviews so perhaps we were just unlucky ...... but just how unlucky can one couple be?",2,2015,05,10
249,Great Place. --  Great Staff,"
I have nothing but positive things about to say about the Clarion Hotel. The facilities were solid. Restaurant service was excellent and the physical activity center was also very good. I especially want to thank the people that took care of my special meals and their kind and friendly banter. This is especially true for the staff who provided both myself and my friends meaningful and interesting information about the hotel and surrounding area. This was especially true Evan who took time to assist us and also discuss information about his home country of Greece. Thanks again for the wonderful experience.",5,2015,05,08
249,Great family stay,"Have just returned from an overnight stay in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley on the bank holiday weekend. 

We had 2 interconnecting rooms which worked really well with cots provided for the 2 little ones. The girls had a great time, swimming on the Sunday afternoon and then again on Monday morning. The pool temperature was suitable for young toddlers and the changing facilities very clean with underfloor heating in the changing area. 

Breakfast buffet was a great selection and the food very tasty, clean plates for everyone.

Would definitely recommend Clarion Liffey Valley for a family break and we will be back again for another stay.",5,2015,05,07
249,Events Team Liffey Valley,"Our organisation uses the Clarion Liffey Valley regularly for meetings and events. The customer service from the events team and the restaurant staff is second to none.

I also have to mention the coffee. Evan's coffee is made to perfection and with a very charming smile. 

Would highly recommend for an event!",5,2015,05,06
249,Could not fault this hotel,"Had a great weekend here with my girlfriend and really could not fault the service or the food or the stay that we had. Hotel staff were perfect and polite, room was very spacious and clean. We good food in  Kudos bar and it was amazing we also had a few cocktails here and the music was entertaining too. One draw back was that on Sunday morning they needed more staff to cater for breakfast, no that the staff were bad or anything but they were all so busy they were clearly understaffed in my opinion",5,2015,05,06
249,Lovely Stay,"Although the rooms we stayed in this time weren't as good as our previous visit they were clean, comfortable and had nice decor. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Good location for the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and about 40 mins from the Kildare Shopping Outlets. Wifi was poor connection. We felt the rooms were not well soundproofed.",4,2015,05,04
249,Coffee,"Had a meeting with client in reception area of hotel,received excellent coffee & service.The service received from  Ewan was excellent, will definitely use hotel for occasional meetings.
Thanks hospitality
EOD",5,2015,05,03
249,Excellent stay,"A spontaneous trip recently brought us to this hotel. I booked last minute while on the way there. The staff were all very friendly. We weren't travelling with children, a fact which was verified on check - in and resulted in a room on a child free floor. Top marks! We had a meal in the Gusto restaurant, best pizza we had in a while, excellent value, very prompt service, and we weren't rushed into leaving when the restaurant closed. 
The room was very comfortable. The car park brightly lit.
Location: easy to find, good bus links, shopping and retail park nearby
We would certainly stay again.",5,2015,05,03
249,Good place to go on business,"I lived in this hotel for 3 months. The business suite that I had was roomy, (mini kitchen, livingroom, balcony, fairly large bathroom and BIG bedroom. The king bed was SUPER comfy. Made me not miss my bed at home at all. Most of the desk staff were friendly, some not so much. Same with the bar staff. There were a few guys that were like my new best friends, but others not so much. The location is great because there is a mall down the road with movie theater and the Arc bar accross the street has great food and friendly staff. Bus stop near the mall. 2.60 to take a bus into Dublin. Spotty WIFI.",4,2015,04,30
249,Coffee Dock service,I attend the clarion most Wednesdays for coffee and a pastry with my mum and my small children prior to a swim lesson. I have only ever received brilliant efficient service from the staff on the coffee dock on every visit. Evan who seems to be there every Wednesday nearly knows our order off and is always so accommodating to our requests. He makes us feel so welcome which doesn't always happen in hotels when you arrive with small children. I would highly recommend his attention to detail and speed of service.,5,2015,04,29
249,Never again,On arrival we were told we weren't booked in after I showed my email they spent 35 minutes trying to find a room for us as it was booked out. We had booked a suite and to be honest as soon as we got to the room it was that small  we couldn't swing a cat in it. So noisy can hear every conversation in neighbouring rooms not a great experience food was awful. Will not be returning in a hurry. Check out was as long as check in ques out the door. Very unorganised.,1,2015,04,28
249,Nice stay,"Stayed here on Saturday night with my husband.  Had requested a room on a high level which was gave to us.  On arrival to our room we were very disappointed as the smell in the room was very over powering.  A very strong musty smell.  On inspection of the room there must have been a bad leak in the ceiling as the corner of the ceiling over the door was all discoloured and brown.  Also the bathroom was a disabled bathroom with a level access shower and no bath.  The room itself was lovely and spacious but we could not stay with the smell.  This problem needs to be rectified before this room is been given to people.  I rang down to reception who quickly gave us another room on a lower floor.  The room was spacious and clean which we were happy with.  The bed itself was very noisy and not very comfortable but did the job.  The hotel was extremely busy but we were dealt with in a quick enough manner.  We ate in the bar which the food was nice but a little over priced.  There is also an Italian restaurant available.  Across the Road is the Arc pub which has a lemongrass restaurant.  So plenty of choice all round.  Breakfast next morning was extremely busy.  Not enough staff on as I waited 15/20 minutes for a coffee and tea and by this time my husband was finished his breakfast and I hadn't even started.  The variety and choice of food was very good not one fault on the food.  The hotel is in a great location and I would definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel.  Liffey Valley shopping centre is right across the road which has plenty of variety of restaurants, shops and a lovely cinema (which serves drink).  You have to pay €5 euro parking for the night which I don't think is right as you pay enough to stay in a hotel without having to pay to park there.",4,2015,04,28
249,"Friendly Clean Hotel, close to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre","I have stayed in this hotel several times. I have got the same excellent standard every time. I have found the reception staff very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are large and well appointed, and very clean.The Liffey Valley Shopping Centre  10-12 minutes walking distance from the hotel.",5,2015,04,24
249,"Great food, great atmosphere","Visited last week with the family. Had the steak which was cooked to perfection! ! All the rest of the group were delighted with their meals as well.  Emma was our waitress, done and excellent job. Also Shane was great. Had a great chat about GAA with him, which I wasnt expecting in an Italian restaurant.  Great meal, great place.",5,2015,04,24
249,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I'm a regular visitor to this hotel. The staff are always very friendly there is a super leisure centre, shopping centre and cinema only a stone throw away. The breakfast is fantastic with a huge variety. Having stayed in many hotels in Dublin this is by far the best hotel for business or pleasure.",5,2015,04,24
249,Excellent service in Cafe in Clarion,"This review is for the service in the cafe, not for an overnight stay. I'm a regular visitor to The Clarion in Liffey Valley. There's a little cafe in the reception area and the waiter is second to none! Both my husband and I have separately seen him in action going out of his way to ensure his customers are content. The cafe is a handy stop off for coffee and cake or tea and scone if you happen to be in the hotel.",5,2015,04,23
249,Excellent Business Hub.,"Mid April necessitated a business trip to Dublin at the weekend. My wife Maureen came along..While I worked on Sat and Sunday she could visit Liffey valley shopping centre a 10 minute walk away. The excellent pool and sauna were available on her return and made for a most relaxing weekend. The beauty of the Clarion is it's proximity to the city centre(15 mins) and a welcome escape after a day in the city. The room was comfortable, the food tasty and the staff helpful and friendly. Most appreciated was Koko who ran the evening restaurant with a smile efficiently and effortlessly. Well done to all at the Clarion and see you all again in May. Regards John&Maureen.",4,2015,04,23
249,Excellent fitness centre and outstanding staff,"I recently, while on holiday, utilized the fitness centre at this hotel.  I was extremely impressed by the dedication, friendliness and service focus of the staff.  While the fitness facilities and in particular the swimming pool and changing room were of a very high standard and a pleasure to use, the service of the staff was of an exceptional standard and tops the list for me.  Congratulation to a great bunch of staff in the fitness and reception area.  You made my experience exceptional and will return when I visit again in July. Thank you all.",5,2015,04,22
249,not happy,"Stayed here for a function on the 18th April for one night. On check in paid for my night via my card. Everything was ok room was comfortable and to excellent standards! However the day after I checked out I noticed that I had been charged for an extra two nights!! I rang hotel to be transfered so many times that i almost just hung up, but to be finally told that they charged my card to another guests two night booking!! I was told to contact the person (thankfully I know him as he attended function also) to sort issue out. He sorted it but I have now been told that ill get my money back in the next few days/up to a week.

 I am upset with the fact that this hotel could charge someones bank card when their name isnt even on the booking. Also I am upset with why the hotel can keep my card details! I do like this hotel but really am unsure if I would  stay here again after this.",2,2015,04,21
249,Good Stay,Thought this was a nice hotel with facilities.We visited April 9-10.I thought it was good for our kids with a play area for our youngest who is two on the ground floor near the lifts.We didn't have dinner but we had a fine tasty breakfast.A good hotel to stay with kids as the kids seemed very welcome here.,5,2015,04,20
249,Excellent Stay,"We stayed here with 2 kids and we could not fault the hotel. From the minute we entered, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and were excellent with the kids. The room was very spacious and clean.  The pool was lovely and there is an outdoor playground and small play area inside.  The food in Gusto restaurant was gorgeous and the restaurant manager was very nice. I would recommend this for families and couples.",5,2015,04,20
249,Good for an overnight,"Wife and I went for dinner, drinks and overnight on a Friday night. Enjoyed the food and drinks in Kudos restaurant. The Italian restaurant Gustos looked like a good place for a group night out - lots of room. We had one gripe which was the constant noise and door banging from the two large families staying opposite us. The hotel handled this very well and gave us a suite in a quieter part plus a free parking voucher. Staff very nice. Would stay again.",3,2015,04,18
249,ok but pricey and hidden charges,"tatty hotel some nice staff others clueless, room nice but felt like in a in dungeon, breakfast 13 euros so didnt bother went to nearby macdonalds, and worst of all 5 euros a day to park a car which i find for a guest not very friendly and the staff appeared to find it funny.",2,2015,04,17
249,Just visited for lunch- really wish I hadn't!,"We met friends for a quick lunch in the clarion. I knew as soon as I saw the waitress it was going to be a disaster- sloppy dresser, hair everywhere, no interest. It took her 3 attempts to get our order right. We ordered salads, Cajun burger and pitta from lunch menu. The food was awful... Caesar salad was small, greasy Mayo dressing, 2 pieces of chicken and a stale looking piece of bread on top that looked like it went straight from fridge to microwave. The chicken in the Cajun burger was cold- straight from the fridge. If I had to give one positive comment- literally only thing I can say is the chips were nice! The staff never came near us after the food was served, so once we tracked our waitress down she took for our meals while on the phone. There's no excuse for what was served there. There's no excuse for the lazy waitress. Never going near the spot again. Sort your staff (incl. chef) out!",1,2015,04,17
249,Not Good,"It was my first visit to this hotel & I'm sorry to say my last.
The room was nice but we were given a room at the front of the Hotel,which meant we did not sleep half the night due to their nightclub.
Breakfast was cold & the area was very untidy. Had to clean my own table.
I did complain through email on my return home,but did not receive any correspondence which I expected would happen.
There are more better hotels in that area.",3,2015,04,17
249,very good,good nigh was had by us the service was very good and the room was lovely bar was very friendly and made great cocktails gym staff were really help full friendly on the morning we were leaving we got hot chocolate in the cafe and it was lovely all together  it was a very enjoyable stay...elaine thompson,4,2015,04,17
249,Great for Families,"We stayed here on a family trip in 2013, We had 5 month old babies, a 3 year old and an 8 year old with us, It is just fantastic for kids,They have a lovely pool with a smaller pool for younger kids,They have a cinema night, Indoor playground and outdoor playground and a kids gym. We had a family suite with our own little kitchen to make tea/coffee/bottles and a fridge to keep some food. The rooms were lovely and clean, The staff were very friendly and helpful, The food there was lovely,The breakfast buffet was plentiful and we ate dinner one night in the restaurant there called Kudos, It was delicious.It located just beside a shopping centre called liffey valley where there are lots more restaurants and a large cinema. It is easy to get to the main attractions in Dublin from there too,We were around 20mins away from most places we were going. I couldn't say a bad word about my experience here and i have recommended it to all my friends and family since.I have stayed here twice since then,The last time in March 2015, This was a last minute booking and they were more than accommodating, Again i was impressed with the high standard of the rooms,Service and Food there.I will be sure to return",5,2015,04,16
249,overnight stay for family of three,"We chose this hotel based on it being close to the city and friends we were visiting. The hotel was excellent though we did not have time to enjoy the food, which looked lovely. The staff were very friendly and helpful when we needed local information.",5,2015,04,16
249,"Lovely tidy hotel, Excellent Steak!","We stayed one evening.. The staff were friendly.  The hotel was lovely and clean. We ordered steaks, and they were ever so tasty.  We would go back if in Ireland again, even it if was just for the steak. 
              ",4,2015,04,16
249,Great coffee and such hospitality,"I was only in the Clarion for a few hours to wait for the Airport shuttle, but got invited to drink some coffee made by a Greek guy named Evangelos. We ended up having a great chat about life and work and I enjoyed the best coffee in a long time. What a great hospitality this hotel showed! Looking forward to a stay in the future!",5,2015,04,16
249,Ideal location,"Lovely hotel in an ideal location for a city break.  Lovely atmosphere and great for children of all ages. Family room was spacious and comfortable. The swimming pool is a good size and very clean, kids time with toys/floats was 3 to 5 which was bit silly as there were a lot of kids in pool at 5 and toys/floats were demanded off them! Good choice of restaurants with lots to choose from on the menus.  Service in Restaurant was little slow but they were very busy. Breakfast was very tasty and plentiful.  Will be back! ",4,2015,04,15
249,Comfy hotel,Me and my wife stayed here with our 8 month old and enjoyed our stay. The room was warm and comfortable and the beds were comfortable. So close to the shopping centre and lots of nice places to eat. Was our second time here and will not be the last. ,5,2015,04,14
249,Great hotel and well worth the visit - despite the dodgy view!,"Just back from our 2nd visit to this hotel with our 2 young boys  It's a great hotel - especially for families and though it's a bit out of town we were able to use public transport to and from the city centre and Liffey Valley shopping centre is within walking distance and has great shops.  We were lucky enough to be placed in a suite on the top floor - our room was fabulous and a bit of unexpected luxury.  Great pool, though would be good if it was open earlier for families so you could visit before breakfast.  Breakfast is fabulous and in a lovely restaurant - only slightly spoiled by the view of the traveller site across the road!!.  We also ate there one evening and the food was delicious and fresh.  Hotel also lays on a great programme of activities for the kids - my 2 loved Silly Sally and it was great to have something to entertain the kids in the evening.",4,2015,04,13
249,Bad hotel,Money was stolen from the room and the hotel did nothing.noise from drunks from the neerest bar. Stuff is rude and not nice at all. Room is not clean. Waiting for breakfast 45 minuts . The best thing in this hotel is checking out.,1,2015,04,13
249,Good choice for business,"I stayed one night while attending a conference at the hotel, so although it's quite a distance from the city centre, it was convenient for me. Overall I thought it was very well run: clean, comfortable and very friendly staff. Sharon in the restaurant was particularly nice and helpful. I had a problem with the iron in my room, which stained my shirt. The staff came and collected it straight away, took it away, washed, ironed and returned it within a few hours. I was impressed! It wouldn't be my first choice if I was visiting Dublin for pleasure, but for business in that specific area, I'd definitely stay again. ",4,2015,04,12
249,"Friendly, relaxing, central and excellent coffee","Thank you Evan in the Gusto cafe/restaurant. The best part of my stay was the early morning coffee.  On arrival I was greeted with a lovely smile, very accommodating with large rooms, fresh and modern, great food.",5,2015,04,11
249,"Dinner, Movie & Breakfast package","Stayed on 02nd April for 1night on a special dinner, movie and bb for €135.00 for 2. the dinner consisted of 2 courses in Gusto which food was lovely, I got a pizza and chocolate fudge dessert cooked right in front of us in a woodfire oven really nice. Our waitress was lovely couldn't do enough for us sorry I forgot her name. When checking in the receptionist was lovely telling us to go see new fast & furious movie its very good and hope we have a nice stay. Our room was nice, bathroom a bit dated for a 4* though but nice view over liffey valley. Didn't have breakfast so no comment on this. I left my phone charger behind in the room and called the next day Sunday to advise and they said someone would call me back however no one did so called again to be told the charger was there so lucky I live close by and went to pick it up around 8pm.  When I got to reception was advised very rudely by the same girl that checked us in on the Friday I gave the wrong room number 427 over the phone and they made a big deal out of looking for the charger even though i advised my room was in fact 537 both over the phone twice and at the desk. I didnt appreciate that just because i was no longer staying in the hotel that the staff decided they can just be rude to me, left a bit of a sour taste after having a nice night when staying there",3,2015,04,10
249,Lovely hotel,"We had read some reviews relating to noise so asked for a quiet room. They popped us on the adult floor, no kids, no parties.
I have no complaints.
Staff were approachable and helpful.
We had an evening meal in the restaurant and breakfast the next day.
All good.",5,2015,04,09
249,Charlie,"Sharon from the kudos restaurant  was brilliant  great customer  skills very  welcoming and friendly  made my stay very pleasant  definitely  an
 asset to your  company.on my next trip for work  I will certainly  consider the Clarion.The food was excellent  and the rooms were clean and comfortable.Thankyou again for a pleasant stay",5,2015,04,09
249,Family Friendly Hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel many times both as a couple, and now as a family. We have stayed in both the hotel and the suites. The rooms are clean, and adequate. There is a small play area for children, an outdoor playground, and good pool, all of which we used and enjoyed. The only complaint I would have is that on our last 2 night stay, our suite was not cleaned at all throughout our time there. We also had an outdoor deck, which was covered in cigarette butts. On arriving, there was 2 pizza boxes and glasses etc, outside a neighbouring room, they were still there when we checked out. We find this hotel very handy when visiting Dublin, and I hope that it's standards are not slipping following my observations. ",3,2015,04,07
249,No complaints:),"We stayed here as a little treat for easter for 2 nights on 1 of the deals. We didn't take breakfast so can't comment on that. Hotel was good clean & comfortable,  food in the Italian restaurant was tasty we ate there both nights. Pool was excellent, really good fun so don't forget your swim suit. Zoo is about 20mins away and is a must we spent the full day there and had a great time. Only thing I can say is the coffee provided in the room is awful next time I will be bringing my own...",4,2015,04,06
249,Absolutely Amazing,"We stayed at the Clarion for one night me my boyfriend and 3year old daughter.it was amazing from the moment we checked in the girl on reception was very friendly asked about our journey to get there.Really nice touch.
Our room was really nice,absolutely spotless,very modern decor and the beds were really comfortable.They had a mini fridge in the room which was great to keep water and fruit in for our daughter.The bathroom was very big and also spotless and the power shower amazing,could,ve stayed in it forever
The pool was really great,they had a small kids pool and they had lots of floats and rings for the kids to play with,very family friendly and I loved that the floors in the changing rooms had underground heating as it can be quite cold when you get out of the pool.
We did,nt eat in the restaurant that night as we went out to meet family but we had the buffet breakfast the next morning.we arrived at the busy time but were,nt waiting long to be seated and it was worth it.They had such a variety,I am on the slimming world diet and there was an abundance for me to choose from I had a beautiful fruit salad with natural yoghurt,wholemeal toast,and when I asked for boiled eggs it was no problem,my boyfriend had the full fry and practically licked his plate clean.
Checkout was as friendly as check in.friendly competent staff. 
We left feeling relaxed and refreshed and will definitely be returning in the future.",5,2015,04,06
249,2nd visit,"Just back from a 2 night Easter break with my husband and 5 year old son. This is our second visit as we also stayed over the new year. Really enjoyed our stay again. Check in was quick. However i had made a phone call  requesting  a room near the lift but when we arrived there were no note of it and we were at the far end of the corridor.  I asked if we could change and was told all rooms were allocated and and no attempt was made to change this. Room was lovely and had a balcony where we put our chairs out and enjoyed the good weather with a few drinks. Rooms were cleaned to a high standard and accommodation staff were very polite and friendly. The pool was well run and staff very friendly. There was a kids club over the Easter period which was well organised and my 5 year old loved all the activities especially silly sally and the movies. We ate both nights in Gusto restaurant. Food was absolutely gorgeous and the staff were amazing yet again. A special thanks to Rebecca,  Aafke, Jamie and Rachel as they really looked after us. Breakfast was really busy and there was a queue at peak times but all the restaurant  staff worked really hard to get the tables cleared and reset. Well done for that as there were nearly 700 for breakfast.  We had an issue in the bar but spoke to the duty manager Robert who was very helpful and efficient.  Finally we had a super stay yet again and I finally want to mention Dara who was the deputy general manager. She had remembered us from our previous stay and was fully hands on and very friendly. All I can say is ""well done Clarion"" and we will be back.",4,2015,04,06
249,liffey valley,good hotel . kudos was excellent with great staff.pool clean and modern.  all staff very helpful . other hotels closer to home with a similar name could do with taking a few tips on how a 4star clarion is  managed,4,2015,04,06
249,Roisin Mcnulty,We are just back from an Easter break at this hotel and I could not say enough good about the place. We stayed two nights in family rooms. The rooms were spacious and very well equipped. I cannot think of anything that I would've changed about them. The decor was lovely and the rooms were very clean with spacious comfortable beds. The staff in the hotel were all lovely and friendly. They couldn't do enough to help. The children absolutely loved the swimming pool and the games room. The hotel is very family friendly and this was reflected in how well the staff dealt with such a huge number of families staying there. We only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and on both occasions there was a huge variety of foods for every taste. The supply of food was endless although we did go to breakfast early both days to avoid the huge queues at peak times. The only negative comment I could make is that the rooms were very warm on the first night with no heating on.  On a whole I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone and I am already looking forward to getting another break away to it. Well done clarion. ,5,2015,04,06
249,Noisy but ok. They charge to use the car park though.,"Stay here quite a lot with work. Its always good value but be aware it's about 4 miles from the City centre. Very nice gym and pool (pool has odd times that allow you to bring kids in which is surprising for a family hotel). Last week I stayed in a room with 2 adjoining rooms and I might as well have slept in the corridor, it was so noisy. Also they was a lot of smoking in the non smoking rooms as it was coming under the door.
Also I can do without being charged to park my car, a total rip off.",3,2015,04,05
249,Quality of Beds - Terrible,"I have stayed in the Clarion Liffey Valley on a few occasions. However, this time I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the single beds in the room. The springs were coming straight up through the matress. It would have been more comfortable sleeping on the carpet. The bed constantly squeaked every time you turned from side to side.",3,2015,04,03
249,Good All Round,"I stayed in the Clarion for 3 nights during summer holidays with 2 children.  Great location as I had the car. Lovely food in the restaurant although we didnt enjoy the bar food at all. Great pool and there was a kids cinema in the evening.  Liffey Valley Shopping Centre next door. Only a short drive to the zoo and phoenix park. I would reccomend to those with a car.
              ",4,2015,04,02
249,Very good hotel. Food is good. Staff are great!,I stay in many hotels. This is a very good hotel that should be on anyone's radar if visiting Dublin.  Staff are very nice.  Very friendly. Surprisingly.....has one of the best Baristas I've come across....Well done Evan! ,5,2015,04,02
249,Second to none!!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here in the Clarion hotel. Staff are so friendly and willing to help. Words can't deacribe how brilliant they are! 
Derek particularly stood out for me as he was an outstanding member of their team. He was extremely professional in carrying out the duties of his role whilst doing so in an extremely courteous and friendly manner.
I will definitely be recommending this hotel to my friends and colleagues. 
Thank you :)",5,2015,03,27
249,Great hotel just off m50,Have been using the clarion a lot while working in Dublin! Big spacious rooms always clean and new towels each day. Has a great gym and swimming pool. The food is really good also. Liffey valley shopping centre  only across the road. Well worth a visit.,5,2015,03,26
249,Amazing city break,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in the Clarion last weekend for a city break. Clarion, Liffey Valley was absolutely perfect place for a city escape.  We arrived to the hotel in the evening and the receptionist checking us in made us feel very welcome. Later on that evening, we went to the new Gusto restaurant for dinner. Our waitress, Emma, was very friendly and helpful. Even the restaurant manager stopped by at our table to make sure everything is was Ok. We were well impressed with our food- just amazing . Thanks to everyone in the hotel for amazing weekend.",5,2015,03,23

Food in the restaurant was top class... from the starters to the dessert highly recommend this food!! entertainment in Kudos bar was the Thunder Storm which was brilliant.. overall stay at this hotel was amazing..,5,2015,03,23

Did not get to eat at the restaurant however. Will have to sample it on our next visit. ",4,2015,03,14
249,Quite a place,"This hotel is out side city nor near to airport, but there is a shuttle service that cost only 5 Euro both side to and fro airport. 
Hotel have both apartments and rooms and a near by club. Its worth staying with family as have a GYM and swimming pool too.
There is nothing on walking distance of this hotel except some grocery shops which take 10 min walking.",5,2015,03,13
249,Friday night noise ,"Lovely hotel, great family room, comfortable beds tea and coffee making facilities, lovely and warm. Great choice of good at breakfast but beware of queues after about 8am. Children loved the pool but we were a bit annoyed that we were not told about the hat situation in the pool and had to pay €18 for our party to swim. Liffey valley shopping centre great but you have to cross a very busy road and it feels like more than a 5 min walk in the freezing cold! Local buses into dublin were very good and ran very frequently. Everything was great until our last night when lwe were woken up by the most horrendous noise - music blaring people singing and shouting - it woke both my children up - this was at approximately 2am. I phoned reception as I thought there was a party/wedding on but the noise wS actually coming from a nightclub around the corner. Reception did apologise and said they had rang the club to complain. It went on and on for 2 hours and ruined our last day as we were so tired. Maybe the rooms at the front of the hotel need soundproofing or the nightclub closing earlier. ",4,2015,03,11
249,Comfortable hotel experience,"Stayed here recently, as we travel to Dublin quite a lot for appointments we would stay with the Clarion in Liffey Valley, as its not too far from everywhere.

Checkin was smooth, keys provided promptly and all credit pre-auth's taken without an issue.

The way leading to the room, I have to admit is terrible. We had to go through 4 double doors, multiple corners and a room at the completely opposite end of the hotel. We've two kids and a double buggy - not ideal but we managed.

Had some cocktails delivered to the room too, room service was fast and the guy who delivered was very friendly - however disappointed that they didn't have some standard cocktails such as a Piña Colada etc. but thats only a minor complaint.

Used the fitness centre (the gym) while there also; very impressed with the size and equipment available in the gym here, best facilities I've seen in a hotel so far.

Got some food for the kiddies and hot drinks for us before heading home the next day and the food was brought out pretty fast and was very cheap, granted it was only two baby bowls and coffee however one thing to be mindful - when making a baby bowl, dont use so much pepper - even i thought it was spicy.

Check out also very fast and efficient, always a plus when heading home on a long journey.

All in all, comfortable for a quick stay. We had a one bedroom apartment suite, so we enjoyed the added comfort and space. One thing to note, the rooms DO NOT have air conditioning - old style fans are provided but are not enough on a hot day. Request a room with a balcony.",4,2015,03,11
249,Great location,"Great hotel good size rooms and food very good , easy location to motorway, and great shopping near by , perfect , staff are always on hand to sort ur needs , great swimming pool , new restaurant on site love the food , great for familys , business people and alike .",5,2015,03,09
249,Family weekend away,"My partner and my 3 daughters, along with their husbands stayed at the hotel 6th - 8th March. We found the hotel to be clean and the staff were all extremely friendly as well as professional in their approach to us as guests.
We ate in both restaurants, we preferred the Gusto. Just a matter of personal taste.
Entertainment on Saturday night was good. 
Down side, the €5/night carpark charge.
We would definitely come here again.",4,2015,03,09
249,Pool is the best part of hotel,"We stayed for a family weekend with children, booking an executive room which has a separate bedroom. 
The room was a decent standard but we have stayed in better rooms at other four star hotels.  
The leisure facilities are the best part of this hotel. We found the pool to be a great temperature and also enjoyed the sauna and steam room.  
Now on to the below standard aspect for our family. 
We ate in Gusto and found the food to be very disappointing. The pizzas were a let down and we had to send back the bolognese, as it had pancetta in it. 
This was not mentioned on the menu and not mentioned by staff when ordering it, so for a family that doesn't eat pork, this was not good enough. 
A replacement dish was brought out without too much delay though. 
Breakfast was also disppointing but we managed to get enough to do us. 
Overall we would not rush back to this hotel, unless we got a very good deal and it was on a room only basis. ",3,2015,03,08
249,Couple - 4 nights,"My partner and i stopped at this hotel for 4 nights as a short break. Good proximity from airport (25mins - ϵ25-ϵ30 taxi) and Dublin city (20 mins - ϵ25 max & ϵ3.30 single on the bus). We found an aldi a short walk away where we bought snacks and drinks as we were room only and the shopping complex (Liffey Valley) just up the road was nice for a look around. The room itself was lovely, clean and the good facilities. We ate breakfast as Gusto which had plenty of options both hot and cold. Arc cafe/bar which is less than 2 minutes away was lovely for food and do a happy hour deal too. We used the jacuzzi, sauna and steam room on two occasions but were not able to use the pool as we weren't informed we needed swimming hats until we got there however these were sold for ϵ3 each. We used the complimentary phone in the reception to ring a taxi into dublin on one occasion and waited over and hour for it still not to turn up which was disappointing but obviously not the fault of the hotel. The staff were helpful in this situation and rang a different taxi company which turned up in minutes so we used this again to pre-book for our flight to the airport as it was early. We also spoke to staff about buses who were more than happy to help. Adding a little map of the local area with highlights and routes on in the handbook in the room could prevent people pestering staff however? Biggest complaint was our final night... We had been for tea and enjoyed the live entertainment in Kudos with a few drinks to return to the room ready for an early waking for our taxi to the airport. We knew the room we were in was clearly a locked adjoining room but as there had been no noise we didn't have a reason to complain. When returning the room the noise was completely unbearable. Kids TV blasting from the telly, man singing, shouting etc. We had heard room service come to the room and there was clearly some sort disagreement over whatever was brought to the room but no comments were made about the noise. We considered calling the reception but as it was clear the adults of the group were extremely drunk we were concerned this would only make the issue worse. We were both kept awake until 1.30am from the noise next door and our taxi was booked to the airport for 6.30am. Neither of us are against children or enjoying the time away but their was no consideration to any of the other guests. It would have been nice to have been placed away from the families if possible. Its a shame to say it completely ruined our experience and were both exhausted on returning home.",4,2015,03,08
249,Bar Food,"I didn't stay in the hotel. We were in the area and needed lunch so decided to try it. I didn't expect much, and would have been happy just to get something edible.
I'm happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I had fish pie and my husband had meatballs. Both excellent. Very tasty and large portions. We were served by a very pleasant and efficient young man. Unfortunately, I didn't get his name so can't give him the credit he deserves.
I am allergic to shellfish so he went to check with the chef to ensure that there was none in the pie. I asked him for two strong coffees and that is exactly what we got. We had been in another hotel earlier in the morning and asked for two strong coffees, but we got slightly flavoured, light coffee coloured, water!
He also brought us a pot of hot water to add to the coffee if needed. I have never had this happen before, anywhere!
Well done to you for excellent service! Sorry I didn't get your name, but this was on Saturday, March 7th at lunchtime.",5,2015,03,08
249,One night stay,Stayed here one month ago for one night. Booked room quite late the night before but all was sorted very quickly. We were able to check in 2 hours early which was great. Room had 3 double beds as requested and tea/coffee available. Dinner in the bar was lovely and we were able to get a drink after arriving back from the function we were at. Pleasantly surprised,4,2015,03,05
249,Terrible night,"We went for the weekend  special birthday treat. First night can't fault it. But on the second night  until the early hours the noise from two rooms was terrible, the hotel were very slow to correct this. My husband had to get dressed at 1.30 in the morning to go down to reception to get some kind of response. It was another 2hours before any thing happened. We spoke to the duty manager next morning and the best he could offer was an upgrade if and when we come again. Very disappointed.",3,2015,03,05
249,"In general, an OK hotel, no more , no less,  will consider other options","In general, an OK hotel, no more , no less, we did have cash dissapiring from the personal room safe! so, if you choose to stay there, DON'T leave cash in the safe!! long long  and slow lines at breakfast on Sundays and Saturdays, some apartments rooms are missing kitchen appliances such as an oven! some comes with hot plate some not. kind of weird the kitchen set up. if you ask for something, you will get it, but, it is missing in the first place. parking is an issue too, every time you park,  in the parking lot, or lower park, you have to go and get a free guest park pass for guests.
I will consider other options next time I am coming to work here in Dublin",2,2015,03,05
249,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I Stayed there for 1 night to meet a group of friends. The staff were very helpful and efficient. The room we stayed in was modern, comfortable and spacious. We ate in the restaurant as part of a package. The meals were excellent from the starters to desserts and again the staff were very efficient. The bar was spacious with plenty of seating.",4,2015,03,03
249,Great value hotel,"Had 2 night Meal & Movie Deal at Clarion Liffey Valley in Dublin. Excellent value and service. Great buffet breakfast and dinner in Gusto Restaurant. Excellent bruschetta and Caesar salad. Huge pizzas. Very helpful, friendly and nice staff - couldn't do enough for guests. Located at M50 and M4 junction. Ready to get into town or airport. Would recommend this hotel. Staff who were particularly helpful were Roxana, Ramona, Martina, Sibella and Ches, but all the staff were great. swimming pool is really good.",5,2015,03,01
249,Excellent service for our group event,"just spent the weekend with a group of 20 and were treated extremely well by the staff.

Conference service = excellent.. Modern rooms with very good onsite support staff to help when your own computer won't connect to projector (as always right?!)..they sorted it quickly and all ran very smooth.. They also offered to print some handouts for me which turned embarrassing when it came out in a much greater quantity than I'd expected or asked for (like 1000 sheets versus a couple of hundred!!! Oops! They did not fuss or complain and I was very grateful for the service)
Rooms =very good and clean (one of our group suffered from a noisy group of party people in a nearby room but was moved at 3am once it became clear they weren't going to behave and respond to the hotels staff requests)
Location =great for Irish meetings... Easy access for all

Thanks team! We'll be back.. With less printing next time!!",5,2015,03,01
249,"Excellent service, great atmosphere and lovely resteraunt.","Visited this hotel twice in the past few weeks, on the first occasion for dinner and drinks in the restaurant. The pasta and salads in particular were excellent and the service was very prompt and efficient.
The second visit a few weeks later was for a 60th birthday party and once again the hotel and it's staff were on point. I found the place had a lovely pleasant atmosphere and was conveniently located and easy to find.
Special thanks to Daniel who assisted me on both visits, the first helping me to get a taxi home when I had had one too many to drink! He was also very courteous and helpful when working at the bar for the party, and also a special thanks to John on reception who was an absolute pleasure to deal with also.
Would definitely recommend to a friend for a stay or function or even just dinner in the restaurant. Hope to be returning again sometime in the not too distant future, keep up the good work!",5,2015,02,26
249,Shocking service at Gusto,"I've just eaten with my family at Gusto Restaurant in Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley. While the food was lovely - both my husband and I had the 10oz steak, we had a 20 minute wait before our order was taken. Our steaks arrived and after asking a number of times 2 of our children's food arrived at the table 15-20 minutes AFTER ours and then we had to ask for the last 2 children's meals - a bowl of soup and a baby bowl. No water arrived at the table and my husband never received his second drink. We were very disappointed with our experience. I did voice my complaint to the girl at front of house and she was very apologetic and did offer a gratuity because of our experience. I will be reluctant to recommend the restaurant which is unfortunate at the food was very nice. ",4,2015,02,21
249,A decent hotel with a good restaurant,We enjoyed 3 nights here recently. The hotel has decent facilities and the room was nice. The Gusto restaurant has nice pizzas. A nice touch is the kids movie night ( free ) at weekends. Having to pay €5 per night for parking is a pain in the neck though although the friendly girl on the desk only charged us for 2 of our 3 nights which helped.,4,2015,02,18
249,Logic?,"Checked in late tonight. Asked nicely not to be placed near the lift as I am a light sleeper!! So instead was located in a room on ground floor beside the car park. Where's the logic here? And with an adjoining door to another room. Couldn't be bothered hiking all the way round to reception on far side only to change rooms. 
Why is it that hotel room doors bang closed so loudly? (Not designed for sleeping I guess)
On the plus - room and bathroom very clean.
Hoping I'll sleep!",2,2015,02,11
249,Great staff and great value for money,"I stayed here recently on a 2 night family package that included bed and breakfast and one dinner, we arrived at the hotel way before check in and the receptionist Jennifer found us a room straight away, she was very friendly and welcoming, and helped us out with a few different queries and requests during our stay, more than just your average receptionist! the room we stayed in was spotless and beds really comfy, we had our package included dinner on the first night in Gusto and we were suprised that our dinner was actually a top notch 3 course meal, food was delicious and our waitress Emma couldnt do enough for us, on the second night we ate in Kudos which is an asian restaurant so i wasn't too sure about it but the food was delicious here too, our server was Desmond who was very nice lad and was great with the kids, pool area and kids playground were great and kept the kids busy, this is a very good hotel, the staff are the best ive come across in a long time and i love how family friendly it is, Thank you all for a great family weekend and we will definitely be returning again this summer!",5,2015,02,11
249,5 star Staff,"The lady at reception (Martina ?) couldn't have been more welcoming and pleasant and then to top that we received an upgrade  and when asked if we could use the pool the following morning after normal checkout time..not a problem we were given a late checkout.

breakfast was the normal buffet but what made the difference was the floor staff..all you have to do is ask them if you have a problem or query. one cup was dirty the and when this was brought to the attention of one of the floor staff she sincerely apologised and quick as  a flash had It replaced .....it was as if she had let herself down with the dirty cup on the table....when we enquired bout fired eggs..not a problem and they were delivered freshly cooked to our table. the staff in the very clean and pleasant were also five star. smiling and welcomeing.....good standard hotel with 5 star staff really.",5,2015,02,10
249,i had a great stay here!,this is a fab hotel with lovely friendly staff! the rooms are very clean and cosy i had access to a balcony.. my only issues would be that the bed was 2 single beds pushed together which made it umcomfortable in the middle of the bed & the noise in the hallway late at night was distruptive other then that for the money we paid for the room it was fine,5,2015,02,10
249,Family with young children night away,"This hotel is ideal for children, the leisure centre is very clean & well equipped. My only issue is that there was no life guard on duty (as an outdoor instructor I know it only takes a seconds lapse of concentration for something to happen) parents are relaxing & an extra qualified set of eyes would be well advised. Proximity to the shopping centre is great for choice of restaurants if you wish to leave the hotel. We will definitely be staying again.",4,2015,02,10
249,Got A Great Deal,"I stayed in the Clarion on Saturday night with Westport United FC; it's my second time staying in it, the previous occasion was six years ago, also with Westport United when I was co-managing an U.14 team (that was my mum's last ever overnight trip with the club. RIP). 

The club got an excellent deal early on in the week and I signed up to it for one night B&B with one evening meal. Check in was very quick and access to the room was easy and secure also. The room was spotless and warm with a comfortable bed. Price in the bar was pretty reasonable. The evening meal was a little haphazard; I ordered dessert and when it came out, I didn't get mine. When the waitress came around a second time, I gave her a little reminder, accompanied by laughter by most of the group that I was with. I still waited and everyone finished and I was still waiting. I raised the issue with reception and fair play, it was dealt with straight away and I got my dessert. The in bar entertainment was quite good later on. Had a good night's sleep and a good breakfast yesterday morning, though the toaster was a bit on the slow side and it was a trip to a partially hidden corner for the cutlery. The breakfast actually kept me going until evening time. 

The couple of pointers certainly doesn't have a negative bearing on me staying in the hotel and it was certainly value for money.",4,2015,02,09
249,gusto restaurant,"Went for Sunday lunch here today.  Lovely hotel with lots of parking, restaurant is lovely and bright and the service was great. There were 4 of us and we all had a 3 course and an alcoholic drink each and it only came to just over 100. Staff were really helpful . Would definitely recommend this for an italian dinner",4,2015,02,08
249,"Awful, Awful, Awful","I live about 30 minutes outside Dublin and had booked the Clarion as my partners brother and I had organised a party I his house in Lucan. I booked a superior room B & B. When we got there I was glad it was dark so she could not see how bad the place was. Ok the room and bed were ok but the doors, hallways looked like they had had about 3 years of stag parties running through them without any maintenance being done. Bathrooms need to be renovated -baths and toilets have seen much better days. The next morning it was visible how bad the place was. We had a very odd journey to the lift which dropped us off at some sort of ground floor crèche area...? We then had to wait for 20 mins in a queue to be seated for breakfast. This was also awful and we both decided to just leave at that point. I would not recommend this hotel at all. ",1,2015,02,07
249,Staff were second to none,"Recently I stayed at the Clarion Hotel, Liffey Valley - unfortunately the trip was not one I was looking forward to - it was because my husband was having surgery at the Hermitage Medical Centre and the hotel is ideally situated nearby the centre.  Originally I booked for 4 nights as this is how long I thought I would have to stay.  Unfortunately, due to complications my stay went on for almost two weeks.  During this time, the staff at the hotel proved themselves to be outstanding.  They were easy to deal with - and I had a lot of dealings with them, in particular with the reception staff, because I was adding on to the booking on a day to day basis.  They were at all times professional in their dealings with us and showed themselves to be very empathetic.  I had two lots of post delivered to me there and again the reception staff proved themselves to be exceptional by leaving it in the room for me so that it would not go astray.  The breakfast there was excellent and filling and kept us going throughout the long days in the hospital.  The room was spotless.  Every member of staff that we encountered were so pleasant and chatty from the bar staff, to the restaurant staff, the cleaning staff and the reception staff.... Nothing was ever too much bother and I have to say I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody and I will definitely be back.",5,2015,02,05
249,average hotel,"Stayed her for two nights at end of january. room seemed fine, bit noisy from the window facing the traffic. room was big enough but nothing amazing. Beds were not that comfortable, kind of hard. the overall hotel feeling is the hotel could do with a revamp. lifts are a bit odd, floorboards in them falling apart, doors on stairs with holes in them on the hinges. at 6.15 the heating came on in the room both mornings, a radiator under the window, im not joking the banging of the pipes would wake the dead. very annoying. Breakfast nothing marvelous here, just alright self service, n a bit messy. its a functional hotel but not that welcoming and comfortable. bewleys or lucan spa hotel or westacre are more comfortable in that area. handy for the hermitage clinic but if you have had a procedure done its not the place to relax",3,2015,02,05
249,Nice hotel pleasent and efficient staff,"My stay was short and the hotel was perfectly suited to my needs. Ideal with a baby. It was comfortable and 
Breakfast was great. Check it and out were speedy. Only downside was having to pay for parking.",4,2015,02,04
249,Rough Start - Great Finish - Fantastic Hotel,"I went to the hotel on Sunday evening to realize I had actually booked in for the wrong night. I booked through trivago so there was nothing the hotel could do. I was panicked, a lovely receptionist called Nisha came to my assistance and was more than helpful, she rang the company I had booked it with and sorted it all out and got my payment refunded. Nisha was very polite and went totally out of her way to help me. She then got me checked into the hotel. She saved me a lot of money and the hotel should be privileged to have someone so professional and welcoming on their front desk.
My room was state of the art as was the breakfast I received in the morning. I have stayed in many hotels in many parts of the world and the only one that came close to this was the Europa in Belfast. 
I was on a business trip but would highly recommend this hotel to all sorts, couples, families or business. Rooms are great, food is delicious and staff are very friendly and professional.

I will definitely be coming back.",5,2015,02,03
249,Perfect little break,"We stayed in the clarion Liffey valley, late booking , looking for something that was children frendly for a 10 and 8 year old, great pool area, they also have a small playroom for younger children and larger room
With wii, pool tables, etc, I believe they have a movie room which was closed the Saturday night we stayed due to a unction on in the room, pity as the children were looking forward to it, food was great we ate in the gusto restaurant , Italian, but you can get just about anything you would like, there is also a Asian restaurant there too, staff are really helpfull, they cannot do enough for you, also I asked fora late check out with a receptionist jennifer, and it was no problem , we got a check out till 2, which meant children had another few hours in the pool, would really recommend it, also you are on the doorstep to liffeyvalley shopping centre with movies, bars, food emporium , I liked the clarion that much I'm booked in again in February.",4,2015,02,02
249,Friendly staff,"Stayed one night here, its a bog standard hotel which is huge, rooms are standard hotel type, perhaps bigger then most. It would have been nice to have tissues in the bathroom for make up removal and some bottled water, they say the water is filtered and can be drunk but it still didn't taste particularly nice. The meal in the bar was Asian fusion and was superb, had duck hoi sin and my husband had a beef dish which was also excellent. The breakfast this morning was very average, not very hot made worse by cold plates. It would also be nice to have the option of fried eggs instead of scrambled. However the one thing that sets this hotel apart from its competitors is the staff, all very friendly and helpful, a special mention for Martina on reception who was very pleasant and helpful",3,2015,01,30
249,Fantastic,"Stayed at this hotel recently for a weekend away. It is ideally situated for access from the motorway and is handy to get into the city center by taxi. From check in to check out could fault anything here! The staff were all super friendly and the services they provided were brilliant with two lovely restaurants to choose from, a fantastic gym and swimming pool and the rooms were really modern with every little thing you could want in them. Will definitely be staying here again soon.",5,2015,01,30
249,well worth a long week end,"when we stayed it was a fairly new hotel, rooms spacious and well equipped, pool although was a tad cool was still lovely to come back to after a long day sightseeing, it was close enough to the city centre to bus in , the area where the hotel situated has an out of town shopping mall with lots of shops, cinema and restaurants",5,2015,01,29
249,Quality Hotel En Route to Dublin Airport!,"As well as being adjacent to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, the hotel is a fantastic base en route to Dublin Airport. Staff were extremely efficient and friendly. Indeed, everything about the hotel was more than adequate, i.e. the hotel itself, the leisure centre, the bar/lounge, the food, etc.",4,2015,01,25
249,Good value for Dublin,"On arrival at the hotel we were given a friendly greeting and we found the staff helpful and polite. Our room itself was quite far away from the entrance of the hotel due to the layout, this made us feel like we were walking forever to leave.
 The room was clean and modern, however we did have a few issues, the first was the bathroom door didn't close which wasn't too much trouble for us but of you were travelling with a group of friends I would imagine this would become an issue. The second issue with the room was we had a door in between our room and someone else's which was locked but we could literally hear everything next door was saying and it caused a bit of a privacy issue which we would not want to repeat. The food at breakfast was great and it was nice to have our own pot of coffee. The hotel generally appears to cater more towards the family market and we have not ever seen so many young children in one place which as a young couple we found slightly overwhelming. 
The location of the hotel was good it was easy to get into Dublin town center as the nearest bus stop is(approx 15min walk) on a main route so a number of buses pass by. The bus was €5 return and was great service we even managed to catch one at 3am new years day which meant we saved a huge amount of money on taxi fares. A short walk from the hotel is a shopping centre which we found handy.
Despite the issued we had with our room we would return here if we were to return to Dublin as it is great value for money compared to more central hotels.",4,2015,01,21
249,"Great Hotel, Excellent Customer Service","We stayed at the Clarion with a group of 110, and 2 tour buses last June.  The management went out of their way to make it a special stay.   We invaded the lobby and arrived well before noon and they had coffee set up for us in a banquet room wile the rooms were finishing being cleaned.  Within an hour or so we all had our rooms, and were ready to explore Dublin.  The food was good and there are a few good choices adjacent to the hotel.  There is nice indoor shopping mall within walking distance too. Breakfast was good too.",5,2015,01,20
249,Great staff and service,"Stayed 9 till 11th january 2015 front checking to checking out could not fault this hotel. Staff very nice and very well informed, food in restuarant was lovely. Rooms spotless and a decent size. Very impressed and will definately stay here on my next trip to see our grandson.",5,2015,01,17
249,FANTASTICO!!,"Definitely the best hotel in Dublin. Just came back from spending two gorgeous weeks there. Place is awesome, so friendly, staff are amazing and courteous and just plain nice. Hospitality is superb. The room I had was so comfortable and wifi was fantastic, not once did it break down or have signal problems which was brilliant for me! For the whole two weeks I didn't have a single problem. Had running hot water (power shower) room was regularly serviced and constantly clean, bed was so comfortable and it was so peaceful and quiet (except on New Years Day as it was filled with kids and families so it was noisy but after that absolute tranquility and relaxation. Food is awesome, gym was good and I love that the Liffey Valley Mall is literally five minute walk from the hotel and the No.40 bus drops you right in the center of the city. If you're looking for comfort at a reasonable price, I recommend Clarion Liffey Valley. Its worth the price, trust me and you wont regret it.",5,2015,01,13
249,Last Minute Decision,"We made a late decision to have an extra night in Dublin and chose this hotel,We availed of the Hotel car parking, Family room was clean and comfortable, we dined in the hotel restaurant which  has excellent food Special mention to Shauna Smith for her excellent service, she was very attentive to our table as we had 2 tired shopped out Kids, we enjoyed our hotel stay and will stay again.",5,2015,01,11
249,hotel stay,We have stayed there many times and were always happy with the service.Close to a large shopping center and walking distance to get the bus in to dublin city so you dont have to take your car to the city..,5,2015,01,10
249,Great stay and great staff,"This hotel is a perfect hotel for shops, Dublin and getting around Ireland. It's located near a large shopping centre and cinema complex and is also very close to the major road networks to the north & south of the country aswell as Dublin centre. The staff are very friendly and the hotel is very clean. The gym is well equipped with some great weight lifting equipment. It is a little tired but it's still very well equipped. I ate out at the restaurants in Dublin a couple of Times but did have hotel food at times which was very good. I think this hotel is ideal if you are looking to stay on the outskirts of Dublin or if your looking to travel around the beautiful island.",5,2015,01,10
249,Good value for money,"Stayed here for one night and was pleasantly surprised. Check in was quick, room was well kitted out and spotless. Wifi had a really strong signal throughout our stay. Breakfast buffet was varied and tasty. Overall we had a really nice stay here. One very small criticism is the additional charge for parking, €4 per stay, given that this is not a city centre location I think it is a bit much to charge customers and additional fee for parking. Other than that would highly recommend.",4,2015,01,09
249,Good Location,"Hotel is ideally situated for shopping at the nearby by Liffey Valley Shopping centre and hopper bus to the airport is very reasonably priced.
I have stayed here on a couple of occasions and always seem to acquire a room situated many corridors away from reception/entrance. There can be a lot of walking involved when staying in this hotel ! Room was clean and very airy, there was a vent in the window which couldnt be closed and made the room quite cold. I do think that for €100 per night some shampoo etc could be provided, I know there was body wash on the wall but just not the same. Gave up on the queue for breakfast, dont know what was going on!",3,2015,01,08
249,Great Hotel,"Great Location stayed there for one night for a Christmas party..
Rooms good size very clean and modern.
Breakfast was self service with a good choice.
Staff very friendly.
Good car park.
Good Value for money",5,2015,01,07
249,Family friendly,"Room spacious, comfy bed with with very good leisure facilities. I can't  ask for more we've been to several 4-5 stars hotels but clarion is one of the best. Sauna, jacuzzi steam room. My children's enjoyed the pool. Breakfast @ gusto restaurant is lovely. Service from the restaurant to the hotel staff is very good. & it's very close to the Liffey valley shopping centre.",4,2015,01,07
249,Ideal place for a quiet city break,We booked in for a three night stay and found the hotel to be quiet. The hotel was very busy as was evident at breakfast time when the long cues showed how many guests were staying this as never evident at any other time. The rooms were well presented been clean and tidy. The hotel is not a city centre hotel but is very good for a quiet stay and at the same time convenient  for the city centre. The staff were friendly and helpful,5,2015,01,07
249,new years,"We booked in for two nights but had to leave on the evening of our first day. The loby, bar, swimming pool and children's facilities were unusable. After complaining to the manager Robert he understood our concerns. He explained that the people staying in the hotel were not the usual type of customer. We were very sorry we had to leave but with two young children we had no other option . We had to drive around Dublin at eight in the evening looking for another hotel and found Jury's Inn great.",3,2015,01,07
249,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night before an early morning flight at Dublin Airport. We picked the hotel as it looked to have lovely pool facilities. Check in was great, our room was lovely and cosy and we enjoyed our use of the pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel, however 1 little tip, if you have to be up as early the following morning as we did, I'd suggest checking at checking if it's an adjoining room. We were given an adjoining room and there were very loud kids and Family Guy blaring from the room next door. So that's my only tip!! Mind you if we didn't have to be up so early the next morning we may not have noticed as much. Overall I'd recommend it.",3,2015,01,06
249,Fantastic Hotel- Excellent for children,"We booked this hotel to stay with 2 young children-aged 4 and 2. 
The receptionist was friendly and very helpful. She told us about restaurant options in the hotel, swimming pool, kids play area and showed me where there were tourist information leaflets. 
Our room was warm, clean and fresh and we had lots of extra bed linen. 
We went to the restaurant for a meal and we presumed that it would have been booked out but we got a table and were served promptly for our meal. The waiter we had was fantastic. He explained some of the Thai dishes on the menu as we weren't sure what was in them. He brought out the children's food first which was great. He also chatted with them too. 
Our food was delicious. Absolutely fantastic-such lovely flavours and excellent value too.
Breakfast the next morning was great. I would advise you, if you have young children to go down early enough as it can be quite busy. We were seated very quickly. There was a great selection at breakfast and the staff were continually keeping the grill/cereals/tea+coffee area stocked. (Only downside was the toaster-it took ages to get bread toasted!)
The swimming pool was good too. The children's play area upstairs was adequate. There wasn't a lot in it but it kept the children entertained. 
Checkout was hassle free and very straight forward. Staff were great at explaining how to get to Liffey Valley shopping centre too. 
I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very easy to get to, rooms were excellent. Hotel is clean, warm and friendly and there is a secure underground carpark as well as a car park at the front Well worth a visit!",5,2015,01,04
249,Great experience,"We stayed New Years Eve. Checkin very efficient and room clean and spacious. Had 3 course set dinner in restaurant which was super both in relation to service and food. We were sat at our table and our waitress was Rebecca who I must say was super efficient.  We had 5 year old with us who was well looked after. Drinks came quickly followed by order and food. Food was gorgeous. Was speaking to aafke also who was very friendly and helpful.
Well done Clarion. With staff like Rebecca and Aafke we will definitely return xx",5,2014,12,31
249,Could be so much more!,"We stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday night in December.

Room was great, a little tired perhaps but very spacious and had all of the amenities we needed including a fridge, iron, kettle and free wifi!

Hotel has a very good location 5 minutes walk from Liffey valley and within 25 minutes by bus to Dublin City centre. The breakfast selection was excellent!

Cons: not left any towels on second day (but old ones had been taken). Phoned reception who said they would get some sent up, then called back to tell me towels were in wardrobe. I advised I had already checked there, as that is where some were the previous day but that there were none. I was told some would be right up. Took about 25 minutes from me phoning to getting them and my poor hubby was standing in the shower waiting on a towel to dry himself. Shower was also very slippy and both hubby and I slipped in it. I came home with a huge bruise on my leg, the rubber mat provided didn't stay put! also I thought charging for parking was pretty poor!!",3,2014,12,28
249,Good place,"Top place for a business trip night stop

I arived 8pm and was greeted with a friendly smile my room was a short walk on the 2nd floor and was very clean and had lots of warmth and homely feel..
The breakfast was a buffet and freshly cooked and a large swimming pool and sauna. Staff very friendly and car parking is 12 euro but park oppetsit at the disco tex and it's free",4,2014,12,26
249,"Gusto Italian Restaurant Clarion Hotel, Liffey Valley Clondalkin","My friend and myself with our 3 God Daughters and their 4 children  had a wonderful lunch in the above Restaurant today 19/12/2014. The Manager Jazz went out of his way with his Staff to make us very welcome.
The children aged from 8 to 3 were allowed to make their own Pizzas this was the Highlight for them. The food was excellent and the service very good. Great place to go for us and the children, suitable for all ages, some Office Parties taking place while we were there.

249,Pre Christmas Treat,"Had dinner last night with a friend, it was really nice and I love the new restaurant. The only draw back was we were not offer a desert menu after our main courses. However I will return to do some more sampling",4,2014,12,18

249,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is fantastic. Had my Christmas party there and it was the best Christmas party ive ever been to. Staff were great, friendly and helpful, food was fabulous (no complaints off any of the 39 staff who attended the xmas do) the band were fantastic, even the people who never dance at a Christmas party were up boogying on the dance floor. Overall, the atmosphere in the room was brilliant. So much fun. 
Have also stayed in this hotel on a numerous of occasions and have no complaints what so ever. Room was clean, comfortable, staff were very friendly, food was delicious. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,16
249,Great experience ,"Ciao, me and my girlfriend had dinner in Kudos Bar on sat the 13th. Everything was just perfect, service was spot on! We both went for this movie deal with 2 course each. Amazing food and very well organized. Thank you guys!
Will definitely come back 
Luciano & Maria ",5,2014,12,15
249,Convenient and will return,"Taking a trip to Liffey Valley and staying overnight to avoid mad traffic was one of thebetter ideas we had of late.  The check-in was a painless process and the receptionist had a very good nature, she was very helpful.  The bedroom was basic but that said, it was very clean and had tea making facilities and a TV available to us.  The breakfast was very good - in fact it was one of the better buffet style breakfasts we had, had in a while and service was excellent.  All in all good value for money.",4,2014,12,15
249,Second visit will return,"Visited before and it was perfectly fine. on second visit this time with my parents, we were upgraded to a suite as the original booking only had a double bed and a cot (for 3 adults ?). The suite was huge. We're talking big enough for a couple to live in full time with all the storage and facilities for that. Will definitely be back if I need a hotel in Dublin as I really like the location (so close to Liffey valley shopping centre and just off the motorway) ",5,2014,12,13
249,Great hotel!,"My and my partner stayed in this hotel for a few nights in october, the hotel is very handy to get to when travelling from the south as it is just off the m50 , hotel was very busy when we arrived with quite a large queue to check in it was around 3pm when we arrived which is check in time so i guess this is peak time, a blonde irish girl checked us in, wish i could remember her name she was really friendly and efficient, gave us all the crucial information we needed about the hotel and hotel facilities and were they were and didnt seem stressed at the queues or anything was really smily and welcoming, we were given a room on the second floor facing the car park, room was nice and extremely clean, we had dinner in the new gusto restaurant that night pizza was outstanding and we really liked the fact you could openly see the pizza chef prepare the pizzas, we had a few drinks in the bar afterwards the bar was nice real relaxed feel about it and service was very good, cocktails were reall tasty and well presented, i have to say the staff at this hotel are a credit to it, the hotel is very big so is really busy but this does not effect the staffs impeccable customer service, bed was really comfortable wish i could have taken the pillows home with me slept like a baby on both nights, we had breakfast each morning there was a bit of a queue on the 2nd morning this didnt really bother me but i heard a few complaints of others in the queue, the restaurant did look a little understaffed though felt a bit sorry for them because that wasnt their fault,  anyways to sum it up lovely hotel good location and incredible staff and we will definitely return again in the new year",5,2014,12,13
249,very very disappointed,Booked the penthouse suite in may 2014 for last saturday night 6th december. When we arrived we were told that the penthouse suite was gone after we paid for the room. The penthouse suite had been confirmed by reservations two weeks prior to this. When we explained that we were very unhappy with this they said they would send a manager would come and talk to us which he did and his name was Adam.Now Adam was a nice lad but no help whats so ever the answer was that they were sorry about the mix up there was nothing they could do as all rooms were booked out they had a 2 bedroom apartment for us but NOT the penthouse we booked 7 months before hand. needless to say we took the apartment but there were no cooking facilities and we had brought a lot of raw ingredients as we were planning a big meal all of which went to waste and we had to order in which added to our expense. All in all very disappointed with this hotel and would be very hesitant to book again,4,2014,12,09
249,Convenient stop over,"We stayed here as a very convenient stop over point for getting to the Airport early the next day.
Right next to the M50 so easy to locate.

Good value for money. Clean rooms. helpful staff. Decent restaurant with other choices nearby. 

There was a shopping mall down the street ( 10 min walk) with a movie theater.",4,2014,12,09
249,Very nice hotel,"Stayed in the Clarion in April 2014.Had to get the single beds joined up but that was easily sorted.Dinner was top class and stayed in the hotel then for the night.There was a nice bit if music in the hotel.Well worth the stay, a bit from the city but that's all.",5,2014,12,04
249,Never Again,"It was our 1st visit to Dublin for our 1st Wedding Anniversary & also to visit a friend, but we didn't realise the hotel was so far out. The room was lovely had everything you need, had a nose out on the balcony to not beable to lock the door properly, we advised reception 3 times twice to the same person for them to actually look at it on our 2nd day! On our 2nd day we asked Reception for directions to get a bus into Dublin centre, it took us an hour to find the bus stop and she gave us the wrong directions we only found it by asking another 2 people why out walking, was not happy!! Then on our last nite which was Saturday we had an early morning flight, which we had about an hours sleep down to the people next door with the telly very loud & still on when we left the next morning at 4am and there must of been a xmas party or something on as there was children running riot up and down the corridors shouting also adults shouting & singing and making a lot of noise. Will never ever stay in the hotel again was very disappointed with the staff on reception & to just let people do what they like at that kind of time is disgusting, no respect for anyone! The best thing about the place was the bed & the breakfast, I would not recommend!",3,2014,12,04
249,our magical wedding ,"I'm a few weeks late writing this review as we were on honeymoon, but my husband and I held our wedding ceremony & reception at the hotel in November. from the moment we booked the hotel in early 2013 the management & wedding co ordinator were exceptional. A lot of our family & friends had rooms booked in the hotel for the wedding, around 30 rooms in total and nobody had any complaints to make. We ourselves stayed in the penthouse for 3 nights and I must compliment the hotel on this fabulous room, so much space & comfort. The food served in both the restaurant and at the wedding reception were of the same high standards, we had 160 guests for our meal and everyone loved the food from the delicious chicken caesar salad to the mouth watering fillet of beef. I cannot sing the hotels praises enough, and even on our 3rd night in the hotel we had a delicious meal and enjoyed some relaxed drinks in the bar. The gym facilities & swimming pool just added to the comfort and it's only walking distance to the liffey valley shopping centre & vue cinemas. We will defiantly be returning to the hotel in the future. ",5,2014,12,03
249,All you require,Stayed here a number of times during november.  This hotel is close to shops and also is really clean and the staff are excellent.  I will be staying in this hotel again when i am working in dublin again ,5,2014,12,03
249,Great Experience,"Traveled to Ireland with my husband and brother-in-law for a weekend getaway. Stena Line Ferries was offering a special deal which included the crossing and a 2 night stay at the Clarion. I had never heard of the Clarion brand before but the photos of the hotel looked great. When we arrived, the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel had a pool which my 10 year old brother-in-law loved, he is a natural fish. Our package also included breakfast for the 3 of us. The restaurant staff were accommodating which was great as my brother-in-law only ate cheese on toast with the crusts cut off. Room was clean and spacious. Everything in the city was within walking distance; good location for tourists like ourselves. Next time in Ireland, we would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,30
249,Brilliant stay!,"Stayed here with my partner for a break away and found the deal we got very good for the amount we got in our package. Got there and the girl at reception said they gave us a free upgrade in our room. Level 5, only 4 rooms on this level, was great!!! Double sinks in bathroom with seperate shower and bath, hallway, small kitchen station with microwave, fridge etc.. Sofa and tv, kingsize bed and a balcony with a view over the entire hotel. Absolutely fantastic experience and will definately be back!! Staff was lovely, only let down is dinner, very small portions for the price, and queue for breakfast in morning with no option for tea/coffee - well i wasnt offered any! But overall top notch place to stay, will be back in new year 😊",4,2014,11,30
249,You need to like kids!,"Stayed last weekend here , it must have been the kids extravaganza ..it's a bit like a large McDonalds . Found staff pleasant , I had stayed here before but the hotel has taken a bit of a battering as far as the paintwork was concerned, rooms adequate , WIFI fine, handy small fridge. Breakfast fine , ordered poached eggs there was no issue about this and were very enjoyable , heard a few people moan about the amount of tinned fruit mixed in with the fruit salad ! ( didn't bother me)one thing if you like tea , bring your own tea  bags as whatever brand of tea they use is disgusting .... One thing that did annoy me was the amount of waste at breakfast by all the kids , taking 5 slices  of beard and lots of sausages then to just leave them there , it's not the hotels fault . My one and only  complaint was the kids running up and down the corridors screaming until,after midnight was really annoying ..... Call me cranky...but when your trying to sleep after  a long flight it really wrecks your head , I would say if you want to be close to Liffey Valley shopping centre and have kids its a great place, also they do a really good cinema/dinner deal there for about €23",4,2014,11,26
249,great hotel,stayed here twice now. november 2013 and november 2014. really nice clean hotel. staff are really helpful and friendly. the rooms are great and the food is good too.ideal for location to the airport and to dublin town centre.,5,2014,11,26
249,Well worth the money. Would stay again.,"Stayed at this hotel with a toddler. Found the staff very accommodating and the hotel itself very family friendly.  Ate in the restaurant. We forgot to book but it was too late to go elsewhere.  They went out of their way to fit us in. Overall a very enjoyable experience.  For breakfast however, didn't like the fact that the tea/coffee was by cup at a time. A teapot would be nice. ",5,2014,11,25
249,Thanks and goodbye,"Great location for shopping at the liffey valley S.C and town if your prepared to travel by bus. I asked for info on travelling by bus to town via e mail prior to arrival and got no response. We were met with a guy at the desk who wasn't too welcoming and seemed very stressed. The barest of information was provided and  it was very clinical. Thank you for your money and goodbye type of attitude. 
The bedrooms are lovely except for the terrible pillows on the bed and the doors to access two other rooms that allows full conversations and kids screaming and more to be heard. 
Pool was busy but good and the breakfast, buffet style was cool and nowhere near hot enough. The wait to get into breakfast was unacceptable. A good 10 mins. I won't be returning. ",3,2014,11,25
249,Nice place to stay,Really enjoyed my stay here. Staff were very efficient and helpful with anything I needed. Room was clean and quiet. Bathroom had a sufficient amount of towels and there were extra pillows available without having to call reception.,4,2014,11,25
249,Great once again,"We have visited Gusto the Italian restaurant when it was just opened and got great food , pizzas and service .
I must say I waited for few weeks before trying it again so just to see if they are still as good as they were when they opened , honestly didn't had to , it was all grand Lisa my partner loves pizzas here and she couldn't find a fault .
I must add to avoid waiting time for table one must book it in advance , we didn't book a table but a lovely young lady offered us seat next to the entrance ,where we ordered some wine ,we got started early :) 
Anyways , great job guys will see you again for that movie meal deal next time .",5,2014,11,24
249,Sleepless night ,"Lovely staff, lovely food in the gusto restaurant...but unfortunately we were in a ground floor suite that was a stones throw away from a nightclub, i do not know the area or i would have requested to be moved as we were lookong forward to a relaxing good nights sleep. The music was so loud I could follow the words and when it finally stopped at 3am the drunken shouts and roars(which i have videos of) continued til after 4am. At 9am we were woken by children banging on the glass doora of our room, as there was a playground right outside our door. Also our in room heating/airconditioning was not working so it was very cold during the night. I memtioned all of the above to a lovely girl at reception, she gave me a 10% off gift card for clarion hotels, it was a nice gesture but it will amount to about 10e off our next stay in a clarion, which really does not make up for the terrible night we had in the hotel room. Very dissapointed as the hotel was beautiful but night was ruined.",2,2014,11,23
249,Great Hotel,"Very convenient to Hermitage Medical Clinic and Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Hotel was preparing for Christmas by erecting decorations so reception bit cluttered but Receptionist was calm, friendly and most efficient. Problem with flushing wc and was moved to room next door in a heartbeat with apologies for inconvenience. Ordered food in restaurant and was glad we were staying there as the wait was really really really long (you get the idea). Food when it came was lovely and reasonably priced but no dish was worth that wait.  
Parked car in underground car park, at very reasonable rate, so avoided getting wet entering/leaving the hotel.
If you have business in either Hermitage or Liffey Valley it really is a no brainer to stay here. Thoroughly enjoyable, comfortable, relaxed, friendly, welcoming and efficient (except the Restaurant).",4,2014,11,23
249,Can't fault this hotel,"Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting friends. Could not fault this hotel. Our room was nice, comfy bed with flatscreen tv. Breakfast was lovely and decent times (7-10) Free wifi. If you do stay here, take swim wear as hotel has a jacuzi and spa for guests. ",5,2014,11,22
249,Had good stay,"The hotel is lovely , extremely busy but nice . Breakfast was plentiful , bedrooms clean and comfortable.  Only thing we had to wait over an hour and half to get into our room as it wasn't ready and to be honest the receptionists weren't overly sorry or anything , and with 3 kids it was a long wait .not a great selection of normal bar food for kids etc menu bit fancy fir children .  Other than that we would return. ",3,2014,11,22
249,Excellent,"Stayed in this hotel last week and really enjoyed my stay. Was greeted at the reception by lovely warm staff, neil and his crew made me feel very welcome. I used the bar for some dinner and was greeted by Sharron, lovely big smile and great personality. The food and room was lovely, the staff really make this hotel worth staying in and I will again ",5,2014,11,22
249,Great hotel for shopping/leisure,We have stayed in this hotel over the last ten years for Christmas shopping and have never been disappointed.The staff are really friendly and rooms spotless clean and spacey.The leisure facilities are a great bonus and its only a ten minute walk to the shopping centre with a fab range of shops.We ordered room service from the new Italian restaurant and the food was lovely .We look forward to returning again .,4,2014,11,21
249,Ideal for family,"Just back from one night stay at the Clarion and overall very happy.  The Hotel is easily accessible and great to have secure parking facilities.  The staff member we met at check in informed us she was new so would be slow, but was extremely helpful and wonderful with my 2 kids.  The hotel was very busy as a lot of guests were, like us, going to Disney on Ice at Citywest so kids everywhere but staff were efficient and helpful.  The Family room was a little cramped but for one night served its purpose.  Good family friendly entertainment in the bar area on Saturday night and excellent breakfast Sunday morning despite the queue to get seated.  I've just booked another 2 night stay from 10 - 12 April (again for Disney on Ice) so fingers crossed we are allocated a slightly larger room.",4,2014,11,17
249,Great hotel,"We arrived early but there was no problem leaving bags in hotel. A very helpful lady and gentleman gave me details of how to get to town, bus numbers etc. we came back that night and were dealt with Nisha who booked us into the penthouse suite. We had a great night sleep undesturbed by noise. We were delighted with our room! We had a delicious oven baked pizza in the restaurant. Very friendly staff throughout. It has been redecorated since my last visit and we were impressed.  I usually come with kids in tow but not this time and even though I would say its a very family friendly hotel we didn't feel overwhelmed with children everywhere and still had a wonderful time. I'd certainly come back.",4,2014,11,17
249,Travelodge in disguise,"Booked this hotel through Hotwire. This is a mistake don't use that company. Upon arrival at hotel was greeted by a very courteous member of staff who was very friendly and very helpful. He unfortunately was the best thing about this hotel.

Rooms are average and nothing compared to other competitor hotels like Hilton. Bathroom is cheap with shower gel pump on wall. Looks like taken out of a travelodge. I have no problem with travelodge but when paying extra for a better quality hotel you do expect better.

The bar is cheap and tacky with no apparent dress code. Lads sat around in vests watching football. There is a restaurant adjoined to the bar but this restaurant has a pull down screen for sport and it was on when I went to eat. Not what you want while eating.

General cleanliness is good however hotel is worn and tired. Lift was very rickety sounded unsafe and the control box on side was open to public

After getting home I complained and was informed that the hotel is a privately managed hotel under clarion name. This explained a lot and I'm still waiting for a response from the manger regarding my complaint. Don't stay here.",1,2014,11,13
249,Superb Hotel - VeryFamily Friendly Hotel,"Spent 2 nights in November with family, execellent service, very helpful staff from front desk to bedroom staff, actually the Best I have come across for a long time. Great facilities for kids, good choice of food in their two restaurants. Great choice of food at buffet breakfast.
Highly recommend and will stay here again",5,2014,11,13
249,A OK,"All you can say about the Clarion is that for a budget hotel it ticks the box.  Clean rooms, attentive staff and a bar selling beer.  Main plus is that the Gusto restaurant is open. Park your car for €4.",4,2014,11,12
249,Very family friendly hotel.,Spent 2 nights here at Halloween with 2 kids and hubby! We really enjoyed our stay and the staff were very courteous and helpful! The first morning when we turned up for breakfast we had to wait a few minutes for a table but again the staff were very professional and didn't get flustered! There was entertainment laid on for the kids so the adults could get some quality time together! We ate in the Italian restaurant once and had a delicious meal all round! Will definitely be back and would have no qualms bout recommending it to anyone!,5,2014,11,12
249,Lovely place!,"This hotel was stunning. We got there early so they allowed us to keep our bags behind reception while we waited to check-in. The rooms were flawless...very clean and beautifully decorated with a safe to keep all your valuables in. A maid would make the bed and change your towels every day and they were always polite when passing them tending to other rooms in the corridor. Breakfast was good although all weekend it had finished at 11 and to our surprise, on our last day on a Monday, it finished at 10. This seems silly seeing as we weren't the only guests who arrived down late. We arrived down there at 10.20 and were allowed in by a polite barista who said we could have what was left. We were then approached by a woman who was dressed in a suit who had a bit of a telling off for us for arriving down late and that really we shouldn't be allowed in. This was very rude. I was also ""told off"" by a man in a suit on Sunday morning at breakfast for sitting down at an available table. He said ""no you can't sit there I'm going to need this table in a minute"" he was seating people but hadn't bothered to seat me and my partner when we walked in so we only naturally went for the next available table. Apart from this, the other members of staff were lovely and polite. The bar was brilliant and we had a blast on Saturday night. Thank you for a wonderful stay! ",4,2014,11,11
249,Perhaps a wee bit too average but priced accordingly,"Were here for a few days visiting Dublin family and a concern for us on arrival was parking. Our daughter has a disability and we booked this hotel specifically for the parking spaces it has designated for this. Unfortunately more often than not, these spaces were filled with large white vans (!) on our arrival at 3pm and by 6pm each eve of our stay. Obviously, they were not badged accordingly due to being owned/used by workers/workmen at the hotel one can assume.

The carpark is an asset used by paying residents who should not have to haggle for a space in this area as we did with the reception staff each time we returned. 

The constant verification process for the car park ticketing is belittling, wastes the time of guests and the reception staff who are busy doing their main job. We waited 25 minutes once just to for them to give the ok for us to sort the car parking. Ridiculous. With a disability, you NEED THIS TIME to get into out of chairs, cars, negotiate curbs, other vehicles etc. The hotel duely wasted around 2hrs of our 4 night stay. It adds up!!!

Aside from this obviously jarring issue the hotel seems ok. The room was fine, pool good and busy (compulsory swim hats money spinner...why kill the vibe). Getting to and from is easy as situated close to motorway. 

Location is not city centre hence making the parking issue more prevalent. Please sort this as we feel unable to return until you replace these factors with customer and staff friendly systems.",3,2014,11,11
249,Great stay!,"My friend and I stayed here for the last night of a trip around Ireland, in June 2014.  What a delight greeted us on arrival, as we were upgraded from a normal double room to a suite! The suite was just incredible! A massive King-size bed in the bedroom, a beautiful bathroom, and a top-class kitchen and living-room area.  The hotel itself was easily accessible off the motorway, and there was a large shopping centre complex with cinema within a few minutes walk.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2014,11,11
249,Amazing,"Just back for a one night stay at this hotel, my sisters took me for my 30th birthday, staff very helpful and friendly, location perfect, and to top it off I got upgraded as it was my 30th to a wonderful appartment, big thankyou to all the staff for making my stay wonderful, we will be retuning. ",5,2014,11,10
249,Good value,"Clarion liffey valley is ideally located. A stones throw to liffey valley shopping centre where there are buses to Dublin City Centre. The rooms are clean and comfortable, they're not amazing but good quality for the price you're paying. Will be staying here again soon.",4,2014,11,09
249,Disappointing!!!,"We still find it unbelievable a member of staff would enter a room at any time of day without sufficient notification to its occupants let alone at six o'clock on a Sunday morning.Ringing the phone twice not allowing time to answer, then a knock at the end of the second ring followed by entry into the room is quite an invasion of ones privacy. Will never be back again!!

249,Restaurant Disappointing,"Arrived at this hotel to lovely array of Halloween Decorations,. I found the rooms were fine but  no frills. On saying this it was good value for money.   Breakfast was self service and there was a good choice.   I really felt the Hotel was entirely let down by the Restaurant ""Gusto"" -   Our meal there was a total disaster.  Our table was booked for 7.30 we eventually got our main course at 8.20, five minutes beforehand my husband was handed a main course and just as he put his fork into it -  was swiftly taken away again for another table.   Two of us received our main course at 8.20 however the other two did not get a meal until 8.35.     It should be mentioned that the waitresses throughout  were very pleasant.  In my opinion there seems to be no system of taking orders and dealing with tables and there appeared to be no one taking charge.  I watched as many other tables seemed to be having the same problems specifically another table with very small children near us.  Maybe we should have been more vocal but I feel the whole evening is ruined when you do.  The food was good in this restaurant  so it's such a shame.  Maybe we just got it on a bad night.",3,2014,11,05
249,Unbeatable in Dublin,Have stayed here more than a few times. Simply a brilliant hotel as we have a 2 year old so the fast wifi and the wonders of YouTube and peppa pig have given us peace while in the rooms. Also quiet at night so sleep is gaurenteed. Staff very helpfull and friendly. Have not eaten in the actual hotel as its proximity to a large range of restaurants in Liffey valley and lemongrass next door is just too inviting. Beds are extremely comfortable and it has one of the only aircon systems that ive experianced that actually works properly. i.e i can actually breath the following morning.Overall a very accessible hotel for anyone coming from the west looking to explore dublin by day and relax at night. ,5,2014,11,04
249,recommend this hotel,Have stayed here a number of times and it is consistently good. On this occasion I was awoken at 3 am by loud noise and partying which lasted about an hour. The next morning when I complained the staff were very helpful and took my complaint seriously and noted it on my file to ensure that the next time I stay that I will get a quiet room,4,2014,11,02
249,"Clean, family friendly and great value ","We stayed for one night with our 18 month old and 2 and a half year old   The room was spotless, we were on the first floor. They are not huge rooms but they are perfectly fine. There is a play area on the ground floor and a playground outside near the apartments. I do love the Clarion for their family friendliness. We have a fab buffet breakfast the next morning which was really lovely. Checkout is 11 and we got it all for just under €80 on a Saturday night. I would highly recommend this hotel. The only negative is the wifi is pretty crap in the rooms. ",5,2014,11,01
249,"""Cant really fault this hotel""","Stayed here with my fiancé on a 1 night bed and breakfast package, and it was a very pleasurable experience all the way through.  My fiancé was attending a course in Blackrock, so I picked the hotel mostly out of proximity to Liffey Valley as I had pretty much the day to kill by myself and it made sense to park there and have a look around the centre before checking into the hotel.  Although check in was not until after 3pm, I decided to see if I check in a little early.  Although reception was quite busy I was attended to quite quickly and as my room was not ready I was still allowed to check in but moved to one of the adjoining suites which was a nice surprise.  I had parked my car in the underground cark park, which to my annoyance was a paid option (a pet hate of mine in any hotel)  I explained to the girl at reception that I would be leaving the hotel at about 5pm to travel to collect my fiancé, and what was the story about paying for the time already spent parked. She quickly produced a parking voucher and I was able to leave the car park without cost. While I don’t agree with having to pay for parking in a hotel at all, this hotel was at least accommodating and flexible about my movements. The rate as explained to me was also reasonable, and far cheaper than a country hotel I recently stayed in.  

Our room was bright, clean and nicely furnished and decorated, the bathroom was likewise clean and well stocked. The temperature was also quite adequate, but I didn’t notice that the electronic temperature  control was either broken or not operational deliberately as it was not cold weather-wise and perhaps hotel don’t want people using this when not needed.  As it was still quite early I made use of the leisure facilities, which were also excellent and in good trim.

After collecting my fiancé we returned to the hotel about 6pm and got ready to go down for something to eat.  At night the bar is opened up to a restaurant/Bar which served Asian food so we decided to choose something from that menu.  The food was hot, served promptly and very tasty.  Staff at all times were both friendly and accommodating.

After our meal we returned to the “main bar” area, which was the only part that was open during the day, and remained there for the evening and enjoyed a few drinks. Some musical entertainment also helped the atmosphere.  Initially the bar and restaurant was very busy, as there appeared to be a lot of people from a tour group staying but by 10:30 most had retired for the night and the bar was quiet and very relaxing.  

Breakfast the following morning was also in good order with a good combination of hot and cold buffets, with a great choice and well stocked.  I asked a waiter for some boiled eggs, which he was happy to oblige and we both enjoyed the food available.

Checkout was made quickly despite the reception area being again very busy with tour groups checking out.  There was a parking charge however but it was not excessive and as I said I’ve paid more in a country town for less parking time.

Overall a very nice experience, and would certainly recommend this hotel, its proximity to liffey valley is handy and if you wanted to go into town then it’s a short enough taxi journey, so a nice place to say in Dublin but without having to “stay in Dublin”  Marred a little by paid parking but from a hotel perspective I can’t fault it, staff were great and food and drink were good value for a  Dublin city hotel.",4,2014,10,30
249,Good Value for Money,"We stayed here a few weekends ago as part of a shopping trip to Kildare and Dublin.  This is our second visit and once again we had a good stay.  This hotel is modern and excellent value for money in a great location.  

It can be a very busy hotel, breakfast on a Sunday morning can be a little chaotic however as part of a shopping break this suited our needs.  

I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,10,29
249,Suitable for our needs,"Stayed here with our two year old. Was midterm so place was full of children, very family orientated and staff were friendly. Bar staff couldnt of been nicer, very friendly and helpful! Although staff at breakfast weren't great. Our table wasnt set fully and we had to go looking for spoons and cups not what you need in a busy place with a toddler looking his breakfast. Food was good though! We booked a double room with a cot(cot had to be got after we arrived). Rooms were clean and tidy, comfy bed too! Pool was great, could use some toys in  toddler pool but otherwise good. Changing area was clean and leisure centre staff were friendly and helpful too! Close to shops and amenities. Would stay here again as reasonably priced and good location  ",3,2014,10,29
249,Decent hotel for half term,"Was recommended this hotel by a friend. The hotel is modern and staff nice. The hotel rooms are modern but perhaps if I was being super critical are a bit tired and a little small. However clean and the Italian was yummy and good service. There was a kiddies club on and he lady was first class and so lovely and friendly. Staff seemed good and although we didn't leave our wee ones as our youngest is 23 months I definitely would have been happy to leave the older two in the kiddies club

All in all I have enthused this hotel ",4,2014,10,28
249,Need to Improve,"This hotel is in a great location close to shops and easy access to Dub Airport & City Center. It has a great pool & exercise facility but sadly on my recent stay I found the pool area was in need of attention. The jacuzzi was cold and has been for a month, the sauna was in a dangerous state of disrepair and could have done with a good clean. The steam room also required a good clean. Its a shame to have these great facilities and then not maintain them. The hotel is a nice place to stay but more effort around the pool area please.",3,2014,10,28
249,Recent family break,"Just back from recent 3 night family stay(with 2 young kids) in this hotel. We had a fantastic holiday. Very modern hotel with great facilities for kids. THe kids club is run by a fantastic lady who brings all her own equipment ie facepaints, balloon making. Shes very creative. My 2 loved it.We came home with lots of balloons. The movie after the kids club was also great. The staff in the hotel reception and the room cleaning etc was fantastic. We had breakfast all mornings in the hotel. My one negative(as a mother of a fussy eating child) was that i asked if they did pancakes and i was told no. I felt more effort could have been given to accomadate my request - as pancakes are not that exciting to make. Otherwise the breakfast was fantastic. We ate dinner on one night in the new kudos restaurant ..the food was lovely but the server was very in our faces asking us about 20 times if we were ok and if my husband wanted another drink(after he told him 3 times that he was ok). he was just a little over enthusiastic. THe hotel is super modern and spotlessly clean. However we felt that the leisure centre needed a bit of TLC. THere was a lot of dirt on window sills around the pool area and the jacuzzi had electrics covered with duct tape - not very safe to see. After being to other family hotels with pools, it could have done with some toys in the kids pool(ducks, buckets etc) for younger kids. It catered for the older kids in the big pool with the inflatables.Overall a great hotel very close to city centre services. THe bus is within walking distance. We will definitely return.",4,2014,10,28
249,Restaurant disappointing,"Gusto s Italian was v disappointing- really slow service which was especially noticeable as we have 2 small kids- had to ask for their drinks 3 times!! Meal was only ok- if I was to return, which is unlikely, pizza is probably the safest bet- that aside,am a frequent visitor to the hotel and kudos Asian restaurant had never disappointed ",4,2014,10,27
249,Great hotel!,I stopped at the hotel with my two daughters for a week. I was very impressed with the hotel. The staff are very friendly! The maid service was excellent too. The rooms are very big! It was very good that you got free wifi in every room in the hotel. ,4,2014,10,27
249,Multiple stays this summer,"Have stayed here several times this summer. Once in the main part of the hotel in a ""suite style"" room; a few times in the apartments; and, lastly, in a standard room. I prefer the suite style in the main hotel. This has separate bedroom, refrigerator; and, most of the conveniences of the apartments. However, in the main hotel, you have access to room service. This is not usually an option in the apartments. The service is usually pretty good. The breakfast, standard ""Irish"" style; that, also includes cold cereal, etc...With no traffic, it is about a 15-20 minute ride to city center. It is very convenient to Liffey Valley Mall. Not a wide variety of restaurants in this area though.",3,2014,10,26
249,Clean comfortable with Friendly Staff,Excellent value for money large clean comfortable rooms. Arrived late and the staff organised room service to bring up pizza to our room which was excellent. Friendly welcome would recommend this hotel.,5,2014,10,26
249,Such a friendly welcome - great value too,"This is a very good value hotel - it's a bit outside Dublin city centre but you get really big well-appointed rooms, a decent buffet breakfast and access to the spa and swimming pool.  The Kudos restaurant and bar was really welcoming, the staff were particularly good-natured and the food was reasonable and a cut above the average hotel restaurant offering (although the desserts were ""borrowed"" from the other restaurant, Gusto, so I had a rather odd Italian tiramisu after a delightful Japanese-style udon noodle dish!).

The room was big, clean, and well appointed in a typical corporate hotel style.  The bed was comfortable and there were actually more pillows on the bed than we needed - never come across that in a hotel before, I'm usually asking housekeeping for more!  Our only issue with the room really was the noise of the fan in the bathroom in the rooms next to ours - they were a bit intrusive, but at 6 in the morning I'm not likely to get up and complain to reception about somebody using the bathroom. Live and let live at that hour of the morning. I did mention it to the hotel afterwards though.

It's a five or ten minute stroll to the bus stop that takes you into the centre of Dublin (about a 20 minute bus ride), so if you're after somewhere that you can crawl back to easily after a heavy night in Temple Bar perhaps this isn't the place for you. But for value for money, comfort and friendly staff it is definitely to be recommended.",4,2014,10,21
249,All that and a Bag of CHIPs!,"No way I can say enough about my stay at ""Clarion of Liffey Valley"" 
Our Stay ran from Oct 8th of 2014 till the 20th! Yes it started out slow, mostly because of us, we were jet lag as it comes. 
Lets name drop a few great people whom made it feel like we were home away from home!
My wife and I came through the doors worn out from the plane travels, and ready for a room, we knew we were in the hotel well before checkin, but they got it together for us on the ASAP! 

Gareth the General Manager after a few days in the hotel along with his ""Deputy General Manager (Dara) made it a point to come and introduce themselves to us! That was warming, were nothing special just on travel! 

We spent most of our ""Dining"" in ""Gusto"" a new ""Italian"" restaurant they opened in the hotel. It was only open about a week or so and we had no clue it was a very well ran restaurant and the food was just ""down right GOOD""! 
The general Manager of ""Gusto's (Jas Narwal)"" as well made it a point to come out and meet us personally, by this point, I was confident they adapted a different attitude on ""customer service""!  What an amazing person, along with the ""Assistant Manager ""Shauna O Connor""
Daily we lived in ""Gusto's"" and we actually never got tired of it!
During our stay we became regulars and as we got to know them & they got to know us! Being from ""Chicago"" and hanging out in ""Dublin, Ireland"" there was not much of a culture shock! The people here are people whom love people! 
Over time we migrated to others area's of the Hotel, ""oh, it's not small"" another facility in the hotel named ""Kudos"", where we met ""Dan"" the head bar tender! What a great guy, and a charter! Knows how to keep a smile on your face and the service was SUPER!

~Now! I have to mention ""John Berry"" what an amazing overnight staffer! Want to be taken care of, John will make sure you feel the love! There was nothing that John would not make sure you had! I made on set of request, I need water in my room and face towels, Oh he made it a point to be sure we had it every night!
~Want the perfect cup of ""Coffee"" be sure you have ""Dorata Jachna"" she is on it! Detail matters to her! 
I hope you find your experience as great as ours!",5,2014,10,19
249,Excellent value for money ,"Amazing value hotel.. modern large hotel.. Our package included breakfast, evening meal and tickets to the zoo.. got upgraded to exec suite with 2 huge bedrooms and kitchenette.  The restaurant was colorful with upbeat atmosphere and fab food. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great for kids. Play area,  kids club during holidays and a games room.. a bit out from the centre of town but a great service.. Deffo recommend..",4,2014,10,18
249,Finally a decent Italian ;))),"Great place called GUSTO !! Love every bit of it the food , vibe , music and very colourful staff .
They do it little different here , it's very easy , relaxed , fun kinda a diner , I was with my GF and didn't know what to expect since it's new and at time you can get nasty surprise but this one for me was on the dot .
Great menu and great pizza , they have a huge pizza over out in the restaurant and you can actually see the action live , I guess great idea .
We were there on Thursday night and the place was buzzing .
So guys great job and will  defiantly see you again and again and again .

249,EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE,"I spend two nights brake with my wife in this hotel. I founded it a lovely hotel, very helpful and friendly staff especially the lady on reception (Nisha), clean rooms, good restaurants with good quality food, nice fitness club  including pool, sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi.",5,2014,10,15
249,"Last Minute Stay, Disappointed Unfortunately","Positives First - I was told over the phone it was 3pm or after for check in, we arrived approximately 1:30pm and the lady on reception allowed us to check in straight away no problems. The room was not huge but had a flat screen TV and a balcony, Modern and clean.

Negatives – I was quite disappointed that the room we were given had interconnecting doors to the hotel rooms on either side, it didn’t feel like your own private room at all more of a guest house feel, I thought both rooms on either side were vacant so we remained in the room on hindsight we should of asked for a change.

That night, we could hear next doors TV very clearly, not only could we hear next doors TV, we could basically hear everything, even when they put down the toilet seat, to phone calls, very off putting especially from a large known chain like the Clarion, I did bring this to the receptionists attention on check out where she advised most of the rooms are interconnecting & apologised. 
Just be aware there is a €4 charge for the car park per night including guests of the hotel. Also we were there to catch up on sleep and we were woken a few times between the phone ringing and twice our door was opened by the accommodation staff. We made a request to the reception in the evening and were told someone would be up in ten minutes over half an hour later I had to call them back I presume they had forgotten. Also note the restaurant doesn’t open on Sundays.",3,2014,10,13
249,Handy for the Airport.,"Handy for the Airport if you're going to be going or coming from the West. Just off the M50 (Toll €3.40 per use) About 15 mins from Airport and 30 mins to City Centre.
Room clean and everything good. Buffet breakfast was average. Coffee terrible.
There is a restaurant but no bar.
Underground car park badly signposted and for some reason the elevator is turned off at 11.30pm.",3,2014,10,10

249,enjoyable but some staff training needed,"stayed here for 1 night recently, booked by phone reservations were helpful and received confirmation by end off the day. We arrived too early for check in, lady whom i think was a manager took payment etc was very nice and extremely helpful, we had small child with us and she recommended  where to go as she had children cant remember her name. we arrived back at hotel around 5pm only to be checked in by a very rude man called Michael, i asked about breakfast etc he basically rolled his eyes at me, total disgrace to the clarion. However we went to our room it was nice and spacious, clean etc no complaints there. We went down to check opening times off pool for kids, and to book dinner, restaurant was very busy, however Eoghan offered us the early bird at later time as he had no tables left, shauna lovely girl was our waitress have to compliment her she is a credit to the hotel, she was extremely busy but still took time to chat to our little boy. breakfast next morning was good but had to ask 3 times for bowls and plates young dark haired girl really didn't want to be there. Leisure center was good just too many steps",3,2014,10,07
249,"Great Value, Great Hotel and even better staff...",We had a great weekend in the Clarion. The staff were great and gave excellent to us about the area and transport to and from the city. The hotel was spotless and we got great value considering it was one of the busiest weekends of the year. I would recommend it to everyone...,5,2014,10,05
249,would stay again if visited Ireland again in near future.,"We stayed in the clarion hotel for few days as a part of our trip to Europe.It was our first ever visit to Ireland.On arrival nisha Receptionist of the hotel was very welcoming nd explained evrything in detail about hotel and even wrote all directions that we need to centre of dublin. rooms were clean to high standard, the only drawback was the dirty cutlery was not taken out of our room for 3 days and had to call on for it.rest everything was pleasant,good location, commutive distance from airport and centre of dublin, value for money and will return.",5,2014,09,27
249,One night,"The room was very clean and nice atmosphere, unfortunetly in the nearest rooms was baby and young peoples so i cant sleep well, but thats not the hotel fault. The breakfast wasnt good, it was not too much thing to choose, and also its not really close to the airport, as it was written on the booking site.
      ",4,2014,09,27
249,good starting point for dublin,"stayed here to start an Ireland vacation. We thought this would be close enough to the airport to act as our starting point. Price is right ( it ended up being cheaper than all the b and b's we stayed in). The hotel is clean, the staff polite. You are about 5 miles from the Dublin city center, which has advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately air conditioning is something this country doesn't believe in (its usually cool) so not considered worth the investment and the rooms do not have an air conditioner, which is ok unless you are experiencing a warm weather spell which makes sleeping very uncomfortable. The shuttle from the airport is not free and costs about 12 euros (roundtrip) per person. To get into the city you will need your own car, a taxi or a bus. Taxi costs about 25 euros to go to downtown Dublin (without traffic). If you haven't driven in the UK before, driving in Dublin is NOT for the beginner. Buses are (at this writing) 3.10 euro per person and the driver expects exact change.  Breakfast was not included in our stay, but can be purchased for 10 euros per person. Breakfast was a large buffet style and the food was good. All in all a good way to start your trip as you are not hauling your luggage into town and getting there is fairly easy.",4,2014,09,26
249,birthday weekend,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for a long weekend for my 23rd birthday. On arrival we were informed by the helpful man at reception that not only could we check in early but that we had been upgraded free of charge to the executive suite. The room was immaculate, as was the hotel itself. We ate at the kudos restaurant on the first night and although we couldn't fault the food, the service from the restaurant staff was very disappointing. We were left standing waiting for a table for a good fifteen minutes and in that time not one member of staff acknowledged us. When we did finally get a table it took a further ten minutes for a menu to be brought over. The hotel has a pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi . All of which we made use of. In order to use the pool you have to purchase a swimming cap at a charge of 3 euros per person otherwise you are not permitted entry and a lock to store your clothes in a locker costing 2 euros. This is not something the hotel makes clear.  It takes around twenty minutes to get to the city centre from the hotel. A ten minute walk from the hotel to the bus stop and a further ten minutes once on the bus. You can't get a return but it costs less than 3 euros per journey. More or less all the buses go into the city centre. A taxi from the airport to the clarion costs around 30 euros or you can get the airport hopper which only costs 7 euros and takes no more than 15 minutes. It stops right outside the hotel and is pretty frequent. The man operating the bus however was not the most friendly.",4,2014,09,24
249,Luxury close to Dublin,"We used Hotwire to book this hotel - it was a stunning bargain!  Everthing at the hotel was to a very high standard!  Reestaurant, swimming pool, free wifi - it has the lot!
Most important of us thre was electric car charging in the basement!",5,2014,09,21
249,Decent stay near the airport,"Upon check- in Receptionsit very helpful and friendly. This hotel is easily found and nearby the airport just off the M50. The down sides to this hotel is that it's very noisey (although we stayed here during a wedding). I could hear the guests upstairs running back and forth and some rooms are facing the road which makes them noisey. Be sure to close your window for quiet if you end up in one of them. Prepay for breakfast in the morning and save €5. Parking is €4 for 24 hours. Has pool! Which is a better temperature than the shower in the rooms. Evening shower went from scalding to cold to scalding, but in the morning it was fine. Beds not very comfortable, hard and lumpy but plenty of pillows given.",3,2014,09,21
249,A wonderful weekend,"We stayed here lately for a large family occasion and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a family room and it was perfect. I was a bit worried about it being on the side facing the motorway but we didn't hear any noise from the traffic. The reception staff were polite if not overly friendly. The restaurant staff, however, were fantastic! I am only sorry I didn't take note of one or two of the names so I could email the hotel about them, but they could not do enough for us. They were helpful, friendly and made our occasion even more fun!
Breakfast was busy but the staff kept on top of it - there was tea and coffee to help yourself to so you didn't have to wait to be served. Also, there was great live music in the bar on Saturday night.
I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,09,18
249,Well placed for Dublin Airport and City,"I've now stayed at the Clarion in the Liffey Valley several times for Business trips to Dublin. 

The Hotel is very accessible by Taxi from the Dublin Airport or driving yourself having a large carpark. 

On this trip I have a family room, which was very spacious, have a queen size bed and two singles, the rooms are very appointed with nice modern bathroom rooms with a decent show, good toiletries and the room its self perfect for working (good Wifi) and plenty of TV channels. 

Beds super comfy and room very quiet at night. 

Breakfast OK (on this trip they are having a refurb, which is needed but meant breakfast was not the usual broad buffet affair)

My evening meal was superb, the pan-asian style food is very good as is the bar menu for drinks. 

All in all this is my default choice when travelling to Dublin, for location, cost and service/quality.",5,2014,09,18
249,One night in Dublin,"Stayed here for 1 night whilst visiting dublin as a group of 11 for my dads 50th. Booked through Hotwires secret hotels and ended up paying £23 each which cannot be sniffed at!

We arrived at 12 after being ripped off by a taxi driver (beware of cowboys) and they managed to get one room together out of our 6 (check in is after 2 so we were pleased with this) just so we could dump our bags and freshen up. 

Came back at half 1 to find out the remaining rooms were ready. So checked in, got changed and headed into dublin for the evening. 

Rooms were clean with tea and coffee facilities.

We had some drinks in the bar which were usual dublin prices before heading into town.

There is a shopping centre over the road which has places to eat and shop.

Busses into dublin only take coins which we found out after being refused travel so ended up getting a taxi.

Stumbled back around 3am into the room for a cuppa and some sleep. Checked out at 12 with no problems.

I would recommend this hotel for someone looking for dublin on a budget as rooms are very cheap and dublin is only around 10 min away via taxi.

Airport hopper is 7euro and again takes about 10 min.

We enjoyed our stay.",4,2014,09,16
249,Clean & functional but needs a refurb throughout!!,"Initially chose this hotel as it was conveniently located to the Ferry Port & because it was reasonably priced! We arrived after a long three hour drive, circa 22.00 hours upon what seemed a busy Saturday night at the Clarion; coaches in carpark & parties in full swing! We were met & checked in by Neil, whom was friendly, personable & efficient, offering a very warm welcome indeed! Had reserved two doubles but were allocated two twin rooms, one of us was happy with that, however, I was not & requested a double! I was moved immediately without hesitation or issue by Michalina, whom was extremely helpful & charming & exceptionally apologetic for the error & inconvenience. Thank you! Whilst the rooms were clean & nicely decorated & coordinated, it was highly visible that they were tired & worn & most evident that a refurbishment is urgently required; chipped paint, stained walls, ripped wallpaper & worn carpet is not acceptable & certainly not the standards of a four star! We ate in the Restaurant enjoying the Asian-themed menu & received outstanding service from Coco, whom was charm personified & couldn't have been more professional or efficient if she had tried; for which she deserves recognition & commendation. Additionally, Sailesh who was managing Reception the following morning was equally as professional, friendly, helpful & charming, providing us with fantastic customer service, which again he thoroughly deserves recognition & commendation! Would we stay again, yes probably as it was convenient & functional, would we recommend, yes probably but would obviously warm of the pitfalls we encountered! With a lick of paint & some investment this venue could really be excellent, but for now despite the fantastic service, it's just average!",3,2014,09,15
249,Ok not rushing back,Stayed here a number of times. Very convenient easy to find. Poor choice of food in bar. Restaurant bit better in evenings. One of the worst breakfasts ever had. This alone would put us off revisiting. Nice pool though. Kids club non existant when we were there. Wont return.,3,2014,09,13
249,Disappointing and rude,"Majority of staff where more than helpfull and very pleasant except one who met us on our arrival, Victoria with a 'J' (Victorija) who I can only describe as obnoxiousness, rude and unpleasant,  which set the tone for our stay. There was no communication whatsoever over leisure facilities restaurant opening times or where situated etc! We were there 3 nights and the sheets of our bed were not changed at all! There was also work being carried out not just in the surrounding area which woke us but also in the hotel which we were not made aware of! We've emailed the hotel to make them aware of our concerns but yet to receive a reply, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, I'd look closer to Dublin City centre.",3,2014,09,11
249,Superb experience!,"Me and my husband visited my nephew and his girlfriend and we got  flights and hotel deal from Airbridge. We were meant to stay at the Plaza hotel but the travel agent changed our accommodation last minute.  I was gutted because I thought that Plaza hotel was a better option. Anyway, we couldn't do otherwise but to stay at Clarion hotel. 
All I can say is that we were glad we stayed at Clarion!! The staff are friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious and VERY clean!! The only downside is the carpet in the hallway; it needs a very good clean. We also benefitted from the gymn and swimming pool facilities. We didn't get the chance to eat at the restaurant because we had a busy schedule but the menu looked appetising. 
The only thing that really spoiled our stay was the noise in the middle of the night and early hours from the club across the road.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel. ",4,2014,09,09
249,Lovely stay. Very modern great hotel.,Lovely hotel. Big but modern and stylish we had a big room with a Huge bed that was very comfy. And a nice modern bathroom. Not a clean as I had hoped it to be and they staff were not very welcoming but helpful. The swimming pool was great. Swimming hats have to be worn. Sauna and steam room were the perfect way to relax after a long day in the city. The hotel is quite a way out but there is a shopping centre about a 10 min walk with an m&s and various eating places like subway and an American dinner. Further on from that is the bus stop on the other side of the bridge. Takes about 30mins to get in to Dublin. Buses don't take notes just coins. If you fly in a taxi cost about 35euro from the airport but there is an airport hopper that cost 7 euro. Overall good hotel but not the best location as we spent a lot time no the bus. But it was a nice place to go back too. If we go again we will probably stay in the city. ,3,2014,09,09
249,let down,My wife and I were going on holiday for a week and as our flight was coming back late we decided to book into Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley as we did not want to have to drive a long distance after flight . We arrived at the hotel about 12 midnight and were told there was no room available because of a double booking. We were offered accommodation at City West hotel and a taxi there and back in the morning. As we had been up early that morning and on our feet all day we were tired and exhausted the last thing we needed to hear was that there was no room available or that we had to go somewhere else . We declined the offer and left.To add insult the following day we received an Email from Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley confirming cancellation of our reservation when in fact we should have at very least got an apology from them for not having a room for us.,1,2014,09,05
249,Not 4*standard,"Stayed at the hotel on the 3rd week of August with husband and 3 kids. We booked adjoining rooms and a travel cot for my 3yr old because he's not yet sleeping in a bed. Travel cot had to be ordered again once we arrived at the hotel and was an hour before it was deliver red to the room. Due to the time of year and the fact the hotel was doing family deal offers it was packed with families and lots of kids. The restaurant was fully booked the for the night we checked in so we had to leave the hotel but booked for the following night. When we arrived at the restaurant they didn't have our booking from the reception but found us a table. While the girl that waited out table I think Shauna was her name couldn't have been nicer the service was extremely slow and the dinner which was included in our package was over 2hrs long which is no fun with an 8 6 and 3 year old. 
While I can find no complaint with the cleanliness of the room I didn't think it was to 4* standard a bottle of shampoo and body wash in one is stuck to the wall of the shower and I was expecting little seperate bottles in a 4star hotel. Even though there was room service food there is no option of room service breakfast either. 
All in all I would say it was ok, but I don't think I will make a return stay. ",3,2014,09,02
249,Good value for money!,This hotel is very good value for money with friendly staff. The rooms are clean and have everything you need. Unsure what the location is like for sightseeing as I'm only there for business. The food is good and the bar area nice.,4,2014,09,02
249,Great location and price,"We stayed here in early August. Got an excellent package 2 nights in family room, breakfast, one evening dinner and zoo tickets.  The food in the restaurant was good. The kids menu was varied, not just your usual nuggets and chips! We had dinner the second night in the bar.  The food was good, the service wasn't great.  Biggest disappointment was the staff on reception didn't know much about the kids club? I was told that there was a movie in the evening for them, in fact there was entertainment from about 6.30, he could have his dinner with any other kids in the club from 5.30 which gave us time to enjoy our meal.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,09,01
249,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here in August and really loved the hotel. We have 4 kids so had interconnecting rooms and were really happy with them, very spacious and clean. The staff were lovely. Couldn't fault a thing. Will definitely be back!",5,2014,09,01
249,Very Clean Hotel and Gorgeous Food,"Stayed here Thursday night 28th of August. Got great deal for room, evening dinner and breakfast and use of the swimming pool and gym.  Very clean hotel and food is gorgeous. Staff were all very friendly and I definitely will be returning to the Clarion Hotel again.",5,2014,08,30
249,Ideal for a short weekend,"We stayed here for a long weekend to explore Dublin.
There is a direct transfer bus from the airport to the hotel which was ideal.
The hotel is just outside the ring road, but there are loads of buses to the City centre if you haven't hired a car.
The hotel staff were friendly, my daughter loved the Pool.
WE didn't eat in the hotel as Dublin was on the doorstep.
Only downside is that there was no aircon and with the window open to try to cool the room he man road traffic noise is very loud",4,2014,08,27
249,Affordable Family Room,"This hotel offers great service at a budget price (we booked early and got a great deal)

We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food.  What I can comment on was the friendliness of the staff at check-in, excellent housekeeping and a thoroughly clean hotel.

Leisure facilities were great, just bring your own swimming cap as these are charged separately.

Secure underground parking.  1 minute away from Liffey Valley.

Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,08,26
249,Very enjoyable break in Dublin,"Stayed here last week with my husband and our two daughters. Having stayed before we knew it was going to be an enjoyable time! The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. Had booked a superior family room on the 2 night tayto park offer and it was outstanding value. The room was of high standard, very comfortable and immaculately clean. We were on the ground floor at the front of the hotel and it was very quiet. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of choice and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel and cannot understand some of the poor reviews it has recently received. Will definitely be returning again.",5,2014,08,26
249,Family friendly but not for us!,"Recently stayed in this hotel. The bedroom was good size and very comfortable. The rate was reasonable. However, this is where the pluses stopped!
The shower in the room was a major problem. The shower head was broken or disconnected in some way such that when I turned it on, water went in every direction. It flowed over the shower curtain and on to the ceiling and floor. I had to use all of the towels in the bathroom to mop up the flood. As a consequence, we were unable to shower.
There were also bedside lights in the room which had the switches ""hidden"" behind the pillows on the bed. It took us a long time to find these. There was no air-conditioning so one had to leave a window open to cool down the room however, this increased noise levels as the hotel is close to the M50 motorway.
I went to the bar on the night. It lacked character and atmosphere. The furniture and general layout was what one might expect from a company canteen. The tables were dirty throughout my visit even though empty glasses were picked up sporadically. The barman was friendly and the drinks service was good. 
Breakfast the following morning was average. Juices were dispensed from a machine and were not fresh. The food was buffet style with a good selection on offer however small things such as shortages of bowls, plates, tea kettles etc., spoiled the experience.
The hotel is very large and seemed to be very family friendly.
It is well used and corridors throughout reflect this. 
All of the above said, it is my opinion that much could be put right with more effective management. I think management is lacking greatly in attending to relatively small things that could significantly improve  the overall customer experience.
When I complained at reception about the shower problem in our room, the receptionist seemed to be amused but offered no recompense.
We will not be back to Clarion as there are better hotels in a similar price bracket.",3,2014,08,26
249,excellent value,"I stayed here for three nights and had a lovely break ,our room was spacious nice bathroom comfortable and clean.The breakfast was tasty with plenty of choice,all the staff were polite and very efficient.The gym was well equipped and well supervised.Their are always plenty of taxis outside although a bit expensive .I would certainly stay there again.",4,2014,08,25
249,Item's stolen from my room!,"Myself, my husband and 2 children stayed in The Clarion recently for one night. On arrival home I discovered someone had helped themselves to my designer top, denim's, make up bag and a small amount of cash from our bag, all amounting to approx 400 euro's! As it was the only place we stayed in, these items had to have been taken from our hotel room while we went to breakfast or the swimming pool before checking out. I bought this to the attention of the manager but I am getting nowhere with it, he totally played it down and they are excepting no responsibility for this. Our room had a inter-connecting door to another room which is locked by key, but who has these keys? This totally ruined our only night away for the summer and it turned out to be a very expensive night away. Will never stay there again!",1,2014,08,23
249,Many pluses for a family stay. ,"Good value and large rooms.
Inexpensive to upgrade to a suite. 
Lovely pool. Great for the kids. The only thing is there are a lot of stairs in the pool area and it is male and female changing rooms, so no family changing.
Breakfast is great. 
They have a kids club and playground. 
Parking is inexpensive,
Near everything we wanted-20mins driving from Zoo, imaginosity, city centre, dundrum.
The shopping centre is conveniently placed too.
The negatives are the bit if wear and tear and the carpets could be a bit cleaner. ",3,2014,08,19
249,"Worst family trip, complete let down and the staff were so rude including the managerial staff.","We arrived a family of 2 adults, 2 kids and a new born baby to be advised that our a joining room which we had called several to secure was taken and that if we wanted an upgrade we had to pay an extra 100e per night. (we stayed two nights) unfortunately we could not afford this so we were placed in a standard room consisting of 2 single beds and one double cramped ontop of one another not to mention we had to set up a travel cot and had 3 suitcases! 
The room itself stank of alcohol and the carpet was badly stained and tattered. 
On our first night we were advised that the restaurant closed at 10pm so we arrived at 9 and weren't offered so much as a helping hand with our drinks, buggie, bags etc. We were placed in the centre of two families also the centre of the restaurant with no room for anyone to move around our chairs or buggie. We were given bread rolls so hard our butter knife couldn't even break them and when we asked for more at 9.30 we were told ""no, the kitchen is closed you hardly expect the chef to cook fresh rolls at this hour""We eventually asked to be moved table and could hear the staff discussing us rudely behind the restaurant wall. We had given them my sons 9th birthday cake earlier in the day I jad asked them to place it in the fridge which shockingly had not been done and the cake was destroyed!
Enough was enough we complained to the manager and were told our meal and wine would be complementary to find out on checking out that my credit card had been charged 95e without my permission. When we asked to speak to the manager again we were told he was sorry and that ""next time we came we would have complimentary meals"". 
Our bed sheets were changed on the first day and replaced with stained sheets!!!! We had a late 2pm checkout however from 12pm onwards the phone in the room rang none stop asking us when we were leaving and when we eventually stopped answering the cleaning staff started knocking on our door every 15mins or so.
The list goes on but I just want to warn people of the horrific treatment we received. Nothing can be certain at this hotel and I personally will never return.",1,2014,08,19
249,Good Hotel,"Nice property, good bar and restaurant, Would stay there again for location, easy access to Dublin or if you are heading west. Stayed with wife and child, nice and close to the liffey valley shopping centre.",4,2014,08,18
249,Great for families,Stayed in middle of holiday season with the kids and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was good although would advise to get down early when the hotel is busy. Also it was surprising quiet at night considering the no of families staying,4,2014,08,17
249,Great family midweek break,"Found the staff very friendly from the reception desk to the domestic staff, all greeted us with a friendly smile and any request that we had made while booking was adhered to, the facilities were top notch, kids club, gym, swimming pool all very well organised and professionally run, food was also great. Would certainly recommend this hotel for any family looking for a reasonably priced break.",5,2014,08,16
249,"not well situated, noisy and impersonal","We were coldly welcomed by one of the members, so we were hurriedly sent to our room.This big hotel with long corridors offered us a room next to the high way; so not possible to sleep with the windows open; the beds were quite comfortable and big.  However you need to take a taxi to go downtown, the bus is too far (more if it is raining) so if you want to visit Dublin, I don't recommend this hotel.  And you have to wait for a table if you want to eat at the restaurants downstairs, a queue is waiting for you...",3,2014,08,16
249,Disappointed! !!,"Stayed here last night for one night and it was more than enough.  At 10pm hotel lobby was like a crèche children running around staircase. 3 workers on reception and not one of them commented.  Part blame to parents but it is not a welcoming sight.
Room was fine.",2,2014,08,15
249,Recovered from a bad start,"Just back from a 3 night stay. As title suggests it didn't start well our additional request after booking for two cots in our family room which was confirmed by email was met with a blank stare of ""your double room doesn't have that"" when we arrived, it took a follow up return to reception afterwards but was sorted within an hour. Also on arrival we were informed that as we were paying by debit card we would have to pay all upfront , ok but followed by the bizarre twist that we could therefore not be able to charge anything to the room during our stay and would have to pay as we went along?!?!
Having said that the food was excellent although my best advice for breakfast is be early - being sent to overflow breakfast area was massively below the standard of the normal. 
All staff were pleasant , however the girl who served us last night (14th) in the kudos restaurant was absolutely brilliant (annoyed I can't remember her name).",3,2014,08,15
249,Rob & Sharon Troisi Australia,"We arrived Dublin on the worst weekend in August for events. We were having problems finding accomodation, we finally found the Clarion, they said they had no vacancies BUT Jaime said they did and we got the apartment on the top floor. I was blown away .... Thank you for your excellent customer service and the food for breakfast was great ",5,2014,08,13
249,Stay clear of it,Just home today and I was so disappointed with our stay we had 3 rooms on two different floors the noise was just unbelievable on both floors we complained to reception but nothing was done about it the receptionist treated us like we were a nuisance to her . There were kids running wild on the corridors at 12 AM knocking on doors each night we stayed there and if the kids weren't causing enough noise drunk guests were roaring at each other.we had 5 kids with us so I'm not over reacting security was a joke as was the attitude of the staff ,1,2014,08,13
249,Don't bother Customer Service is terrible,We had a terrible experience with this hotel. We tried to enquire about an additional room and Mandy at reception/customer service treated me like an inconvenience. I would not recommend this hotel based on this one bad experience. ,1,2014,08,12
249,"Ok, even without kids","We stayed here in a busy (holiday) time of the year. There were lots of families and loads of kids, some less well behaved than others of course. If you think this is going to annoy you, do not stay here. 

On the other hand, if you do have kids it may be o.k. for you. There were facilities for kids and teens like a swimming pool but that didn't have the best opening times for children though, if you are out during the day. There was a kiddy zone and a seperate space for older kids with pool table, table football, air football, play stations etc. Don't know if it was all working because we never saw any kids in there. We noticed that for pool and air soccer had to be paid. Maybe also for the other facilities.

Breakfast, staff, etc: okay. Nothing special, just  good.

Room: large with all you need, a.o. strong hairdryer, iron, ironing board, large safe, fridge, tv, fan. Our room (ground floor) was quite warm. Window does not open very far. We heard some noise from the parking lot. 

Some of the eating/drinking areas had airco.

Going downtown is easy. Park at or walk to (10 mins) the shopping area, go over the pedestrian bridge and take one of the 4 buses (25a, 66, 67 40) Costs 2,60 € per ticket, pay on the bus, exact fare needed. 
When you go back (66 and 67 to Maynooth,  25a to Lucan) ask the busdriver where to get off for the Clarion hotel. You can get off a busstop closer to the hotel (then where you got on the bus) cut through the field and you are home.
",4,2014,08,08
249,Disappointing,"We booked to stay in the Clarion Liffey Valley due to the great facilities they had for children on their website ,namely their movie nights and their kids club.I think we may have oversold it to our girls as they were hugely disappointed on our arrival to be told that "" kids club doesn't happen on Thursday"" yep you've guessed it we arrived on Thursday!  We then booked our meal in a nearby restaurant for 6:30 as we wanted to be back at our hotel so the girls could watch Tangled for movie night ,when we arrived I asked where they could be signed in only to be met with blank stares ,there was no supervision.The duty manager happened to walk by and I asked if there would be supervision ,whilst sympathetic he said he had no staff to spare.This may be the situation and I appreciate that but I feel that this should be made very clear on their website,had we known of the sporadic kids activities on offer we would have booked into one of many many other hotels that do genuinely cater for children ,if only they had been as creative with their actual activities as they were about writing about them we would all have been very happy.
The bottom line is bring a babysitter ,don't stay on a Thursday or the easier option stay elsewhere!",3,2014,08,07
249,Fantastic Hotel & Pool,Stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days. When we arrived to check in we were told the room wasn't ready yet so we had to wait in the lobby for 30 minutes or so. When we got to the room we opened the room door to find a suite. WOW. From that moment on we were in love with the place. Food was excellent. Pool and Sauna and changing rooms were spotless. Would definitely go back here again. Well done all at the hotel for making our stay soo relaxing and peaceful. ,5,2014,08,07
249,"Great rates, great staff, comfy but queues for breakfast.","We booked this hotel for three nights with our three kids. We were given interconnecting rooms which was perfect. I couldn't book on line but when I phoned was met with helpful reservation staff. The confirmation email had the wrong details three times (I had to phone three further times, wrong price, wrong numbers staying and wrong deal). When we arrived at reception there were no 
Problems checking in. We weren't told about breakfast times or where the spa etc was but we were able to find that out.
We saw a sign up that peak time for breakfast was after 9.30 so we made a point of going early. While it was busy at 8.30 we were seated easily and get our breakfast promptly but this is not for the faint hearted as it is mainly families with small children (us included!).this morning we arrived 10 minutes later than usual and were directed into the restaurant area next door - while staff tried their best to make this work it wasn't smooth, had to wait on weetabix, beans, juice, no pots of tea/coffee and one major problem- cold plates for the hot breakfast. 
The rooms were very comfortable and clean. No face cloths but enough clean towels, body wash and a great hairdryer. We forgot toothbrushes and were given the two we needed complimentary from the hotel. The beds were very comfortable and extra pillows were In the rooms. We were fortunate to get warm weather and both our rooms had fans which were put to good use.
The hotel had lots of offers on for food and food and cinema tickets which we didn't use but it's good this is possible and they seemed to be good value.
One down side was that we had to pay €4 per day parking. I've never had to pay for the privilege of parking at a hotel before unless in USA. Overall a good stay and I would go back.
We got the bus into Dublin city centre to save us driving in city traffic- there is a 15 minute walk to the bus stop. There is a 10 minute walk to the liffey valley shopping centre which we visited also.
We only used the pool once - staff were very friendly but they had no towels and we had to go back to our rooms to get towels and then had wet towels the next morning. The pool was very busy again with families but there were adult only swim times.",4,2014,08,06
249,Disappointed with kids club!,"Havin just returned from a 2 night family break I was disappointed with the lack of information for kids club.  There was a timetable with movies and activities at reception, however when my daughter and me tried to find the movie room it was empty and the movie  advertised was not available. There were no kids there and a staff member said it wasn't his problem as it was unsupervised.  There were lots of kids just hanging around the bar with their parents. The same staff member said there would be supervised activities later in the week. This was of no use to us as we were heading home on tues. Also a parking charge for paying guests was ridiculous.  Food was good but not a lot of choice in the bar. We stayed at the sligo clarion and could not fault it especially kids activities and that's why we chose to stay here. Would never return to clarion liffey valley and would not recommend it!",2,2014,08,06
249,Good,"We stayed here in the middle of July and as you would expect it was very busy and there were a lot of families (as you would expect for a family friendly hotel!) For the simple reason that my partner and I do not have children we wouldn't stay here again but that's not to say there is anything wrong with this hotel!
On check in the friendly gentleman at reception allocated us a quiet room on the ground floor. The location of this hotel is great. 
We didn't dine here, just had a drink at the bar. 
The room was clean and comfortable, well done to housekeeping!
After a restful night's sleep we had breakfast which was nice. 
As you would expect, after giving your email details I was sent a customer review survey which I duly filled out. However, I got 3 more of these in the following days which was a bit annoying as I hate being bombarded with emails of this kind.
All in all, a good stay, thank you.",3,2014,08,06
249,Needs modernised and cleaned,"Booked in here by my work and have now told them please don't again. At reception I handed then the booking voucher and was told they don't have a booking even though the voucher clearly stated that I do. Eventually they found it. They then asked me how I was going to pay and yet again I pointed out the voucher which clearly stated that the room, dinner and breakfast was paid for. After several minutes of yes and no-ing they then agreed that the room was paid for. I was told where my room was and had to walk down several long dirty corridors (badly stained carpets, beers bottles and dirty plates, this was early afternoon). Got to my very very warm room, opened the window to let some air in and all I got was a lot of noise. The room does not have any air con, all it has is a noisy fan. Had a bit of time to kill later on so decided to use the facilities, pool not very big so could not get a good swim. (you need a swimming cap in all Irish hotels so either bring one or pay the high hotel prices) The changing rooms were dirty, the Jacuzzi was a bit warm and you can only stay in for a few minutes. 
I went down for a bit of dinner later on and asked to charge the meal to the room as it was already paid for, they phoned reception to check and told me I could not as I have not left any credit card details, I explained again that it is all paid for and was told to go and speak to the reception. After confirming yet again that it was paid for I asked for a wake up call and also breakfast in my room as I was leaving at 5am and the restaurant would not be open. They said that that's Ok. After a bad nights sleep in a very hot room I got my wake up call at 5am but no breakfast. tried to have a shower but no soap/ shampoo in the dispenser. Complained on the way out and was told that nobody informed the night shift that I was to have my breakfast in my room. I said that it was written down on the same sheet as the wake up call. ""Nope"" was all I got as a reply. Left the Hotel tired and hungry. Hoping that my work never books me in here again.",3,2014,08,05
249,Rooms too warm to sleep,Booked a mid week break last week in the above hotel. They had a deal of two nights B&B with family pass to Tayto Park or Dublin Zoo. The hotel itself is very nice and comfortable but we had a family room two adults and two kids but we had to leave a fan on all night to try to cool down the room.,2,2014,08,05
249,Helpful Staff!,I have stayed here on a number of occasions and the hotel is always well presented and enjoyable...special mention on my most recent stay for the staff that helped me to recover the watch which I left behind in my room...much appreciated and thanks again!,4,2014,08,05
249,Hot Room with no air con,"This property is well located just off the N4 and sits on the edge of a shopping complex.  Its a large hotel with ample secure parking, charged at 4 Euro per night.  Very pleasant check in staff, allocated a room right at the entrance to the bedroom hallway.  This made the room rather noisy with lots of kids running around the corridor and loud voices from passing hotel patrons.
The bedroom although spacious and well furnished, was uncomfortably hot as there is no air conditioning.  The bed covering was a quilt rather than sheets so in a hot room it was either a quilt or nothing.
We secured this hotel through Travel Republic for £59 which we felt was a good deal but overall, for the reasons stated above, we were disappointed with our stay.",3,2014,08,02
249,1 night romantic break,Welcome at reception v good..very friendly and efficient.bar also friendly and professional.room lovely.v clean and well equiped and spacious...but restaurant does not offer value for money at & service is slow..would hesitate to return ir recomend it to friends & family.wouldnt include dinner as part of package,3,2014,08,01
249,There are better hotels close by - choose them!,"I have been visiting the area on business recently and it was recommended I stay at this hotel.  I can't say it was the overall stay that completely put me off, but a long list of small issues. I'm not even going to go through them. There are much better hotel options close by, I know I will be choosing one of them in future.

I gave feedback when they sent an email asking for my thoughts on my stay and I didn't get any communication from the manager asking to get in touch. Perhaps they don't look at these - only the bad reviews published on websites.",1,2014,08,01
249,Poor,Hi folks if you are booking the clarion hotel in liffey valley and have kids then prepare for a very restless night we had a room on the 1st floor 317 and the room next to us was so bad it was nearly 1am when we got to sleep we tried at around 9:40pm but to no avail the people next door or better the kids next door ran riot all night up and down the landing at one stage we could feel the partition wall move with the thumping next door it was so bad we were going to get into our car and drive home to galway at that hour of the night if it ment having a nights sleep now we are not needy people who complain for the least thing but this was over the edge stuff hence to say we wont be going there again even if we got it for nothing for shame clarion for shame,2,2014,07,31
249,Short stay!,"just back from a lovely stay. The hotel is sitting on a very busy area of Dublin. The staff were lovely and the food was nice breakfast was to die for with plenty of choice., excellent facilities with a very large modern gym and lovely pool. The rooms were a nice size and very clean.",4,2014,07,31
249,"Good staff, family friendly and easy to get to.","Stayed with kids in July 2014 for one night to facilitate trips to the Zoo and Tayto Park. This is a good base to use to explore both of these options as they are relatively close. We took a bus to the Zoo; if you walk past Liffey Valley shopping centre and cross the pedestrian bridge over the dual carriageway the bus stop is at the bottom. Take number 66 bus and get off at the entrance to Phoenix Park. It is a short walk to the Zoo from here.

We drove to Tayto Park up the N2/M2 and this is relatively well signposted. The hotel itself is clean with excellent front desk staff who were very helpful. Pool and leisure facilities are really good although the jacuzzi was out of action. Unlike some other hotels the kids were allowed in for a realistic time period during the day and loved it. 

Food was good although we did have a grumpy waitress; come on folks- if you don't like your job don't take it out on the customers! Wine price was usual extortionate Irish rate and although nice was not worth the money. The hotel is poorly ventilated in the bedroom areas with a small window and unfortunately we stayed during a heat wave. The room was oppressive and warmer than our recent stay in Spain which is saying something!

There are lots of activites for the children and this is really geared up as a family friendly hotel - I would recommend it.",4,2014,07,31
249,Excellent stay,"Hotel was very nice, staff are all very courteous and friendly. Food was excellent expecially the asian restaurant.  The leisure centre is faboulous. Would highly recommend. Is perfect for families and very child friendly.",5,2014,07,29
249,Shocking Heat,"Hotel is nice and clean, offers some good kids activities but the Kudos bar food is very expensive, the main gripe here is the heat in the rooms, please do not stay here unless you like to sweat like a pig, the staff were lovely and the hotel was good other than this when checking out the guy next to me was also complaining about the heat in his room and he had a balcony left open only to the kept awake by the noise from the airplanes coming and going.  Not for me not returning, no now never ! I wonder if its that hot in hell oh by the way there is NO air conditioning in any room, although they will provide a fan if you ask.",2,2014,07,28
249,Excellent family stay,"just back from an excellent stay. very busy modern hotel, but great value, nice breakfasts with no rush, excellent facilities with a very large modern gym and lovely pool/sauna. Nice kids area that was very clean and secured and even had a nice kids club that was staffed very with nice girls that made our children very welcome and were very generous. very fast wifi everywhere in the hotel which allowed skype/netflix etc. rooms were a good size and very clean and modern.
overall very nice stay, can see why it was so busy. Straff were all very professional and friendly and very efficient. Very close to M50 and certainly not a city centre hotel, but was great for us",5,2014,07,28
249,Please get air con.,"Stay here for it's good location, and it's good for the kids, but I end up been sick everytime I come home due to the heat in the rooms  and then having to put on the fan and open the window and still there is no air. Please up grade and get air cond.
Swimming pool is good was busy at the kids play time but several kids hogged all the inflatable toys.
Kids club ok, but not really supervised we went one night half way through the movie and no one was watching it and no adult supervision to be seen, I have seen some great kids clubs in ireland well run/supervised you should check these out.
Food is pleasant and enjoyable. Paying for parking is a bit crazy,there needs to be an alternative for that also.
Overall it is a hotel in a good location and good for families, but really needs a few bits upgraded.",4,2014,07,28
249,Will definately return :),"We as a family of four stayed for two nights and I am very impressed :) when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a two bedroom apartment.wow, spotless clean, spacious, and comfortable.as part of our deal we had dinner on the first night
Absaloutely beautiful. and I was very impressed with the kids options and the portion sizes were huge.staff in restaurant were all lovely !went to the pool for a swim and the kids had a ball..breakfast was also very good.as part of our package we got zoo tickets aswell .from the hotel it cost 18 euro for a taxi which we found to be reasonable.our oldest son took part in the kids activities and he had a lot of fun :)shopping center is just a few mins walk up the road and has some fantastic shops. All in all I found the clarion to be fantastic value for money and the kids had fun.i will return again.maybe a point ye might take on board when we checked in we got no information about the facilities in the hotel.maybe a print out with restaurant times and pool times for kids and kids clubs and some info about the restaurants would be nice.there was no information booklet in room either.thanks again to all and we will return .Eve",5,2014,07,28
249,Room to improve,"Staff excellent -so helpful and generous with their time. Food too is v good. Dislike that as a resident you have to pay €4 daily for parking - one day we paid €8 because we wanted to go to nearby shopping centre. No such charge in Clarion, Limerick. Heat in rooms is tough going and really uncomfortable. Fan supplied but doesn't really help.",2,2014,07,25
249,Clarion 5 day stay,"A large somewhat rambling new hotel. Check-in desk is too small so some wait to be attended. Very friendly helpful staff. We had a double room in the sub-ground floor which was excellent - no views, but we weren't there for that. The room was clean and generously fitted out although the bed was on the hard side. Good shower over the bath.
Had one dinner which was well cooked and generous and a very fair price with excellent service.",4,2014,07,24
249,What an upgrade!,"I arrived at The Clarion about 11pm and was warmly greeted by 2 cheerful and good humoured blokes on reception. It was just me on a business trip after a long day so I was somewhat cheered up to be upgraded to a penthouse on the 4th floor. The penthouse included the bedroom and bathroom as well as a generous entrance lobby, a kitchen a large lounge and a veranda. Equipment included a fridge, microwave oven, toaster, 2 TVs, a shower and a bath. Breakfast was very acceptance too. Check out was quick and efficiently operated.
If I were hyper-critical, the penthouse didn't have air conditioning, which I think somebody (unlike me) forking out proper money for this accommodation would expect. At the time of writing this, Ireland is experiencing unusually warm weather and the Aircon would be very welcome.",4,2014,07,24
249,Its perfect for its purpose,"Very clean, friendly, welcoming hotel with well appointed rooms and a very good leisure suite and gym. The food in the Kudos bar is very nice and there are some good meal deals. It is ideal for family or business and I will be back. The staff were very accommodating, I didnt have a booking on my last visit and the hotel was very busy but they looked after me. Thank you.",4,2014,07,24
249,Great Value for money,"This hotel is a great location for business visits, just two mins from the M50. This hotel has done some upgrades in the past year adding wifi, new flat screen TV's which was needed. The food is here is superb, both dinner and breakfast. Staff are lovely.",4,2014,07,22
249,Busy Family Hotel with Excellent Friendly Service,"We took this hotel as part of our driving tour of Ireland.

The hotel is quite vast and was quite busy due to the summer vacation, so be prepared for the normal scene of kids running about the hotel and parents scrambling behind them trying to establish some sort of order. Nonetheless, the hotel's staff is doing their best to make your stay as comfortable as possible, and this is indeed one of the major things which it has going for it. Members of staff are welcoming, polite and very attentive and they should be commended for it!

Rooms are large, modern and very clean. Breakfast should be taken during the early hours of the morning to avoid the crowds and queues.

This hotel is not central, but offers good access to Dublin city centre via bus services located nearby which run every few minutes and takes under 20 minutes.",4,2014,07,22
249,Excellent Dublin base if you are driving,"Large hotel with parking beside Liffey Valley shopping centre and retail park, including multiplex cinema, food court and restaurants. Just off the M50 ring road, so convenient for tavelling north to the airport, or south of the city. Also at M50 junction, for easy straight drive into the city cente.  Good leisure facilities. Very good breakfast. 
On the downside, there was no airconditioning in our room, and it overlooked the busy road, so we had to choose between noisy traffic, or very warm room.  Also, children can only use the swimming pool between 9am and 7pm - inconvenient if you have plans for your days in Dublin. 
Staff were friendly and helpful
Its not a luxurious hotel, but excellent value for money by Dublin standards.",4,2014,07,20
249,Pleasant and relaxing stay,"Just back from a very pleasant weekend at the Clarion Liffey Valley. Really friendly staff, lovely clean roon, very convenient to the large shopping centre and cinema, and only a shortish cab ride into town. Nice pool and gym, lovely buffet breakfast. Couldn't find fault with any part of our experience, and all for a very decent rate when booked online.
Travelled without the children this time, but plenty of families around who all seemed to be enjoying the facilities. Will come to stay again!",5,2014,07,18
249,"Lovely Family Hotel, friendly staff and great service","Stayed here on a 2 night b&b, 1 evening meal for 2 adults and 2 kids, great value and we took full advantage of the swimming pool every day, and even the morning that we left, before breakfast, there is a playground outside for the kids which is great and it's a 10 minute walk from Liffey valley shopping centre and Multiplex cinema.
The dinner that was included was a surprise, 3 course, 4 choices with a steak at a €5 suppliment, great value as it was in the package and Shauna, our waitress was so friendly and attentative. Even when my 8 year old spilt her slushy, it was cleaned up without any fuss
The food was top notch, goats cheese parcels with brown bread croute, red onion marmalade and cheese baked in a crispy filo parcel ( Would you know, I'm a chef? ) and the chicken wings tossed in louisianna hot sauce and served with a mild blue cheese dip were amazing, as were the mains and desserts.
Breakfast was busy, but again, the staff were so professional and friendly, getting a fried egg and beans was no problem and the coffee pots are class, cold and safe on the outside and piping hot coffee, loved it
Really recommend this hotel to everyone with a family who just want a chilling few days, the kids club has a movie every night and my kids loved every minute as did we, keep up the good work :)",4,2014,07,17
249,Pleasant stay,"I stayed here for 1 night on a saturday with my husband and 2 young sons before we flew from Dublin airport. I booked it through a comparison website and was very pleased. We had a small wait when we arrived to check in and when we did we were offered a free upgrade to a 1 bedroom apartment. This was in a separate block close to the main building. We were very impressed with the apartment. The boys slept on a sofa bed in a large lounge (bigger than our own!) The sofa bed wasn't the most comfortable but the kids were fine. The lounge had a impressive kitchen along one side and a balcony. We had a very good sized bedroom, all very nicely decorated. Road noise was quite loud and a group of guests were noisy early hours of the morning but on the whole I found it quiet. There was even a washing machine in the apartment.
Unfortunately we didn't have time to use the swimming pool but the kids did use the well equipped playground. It was busy at breakfast time but there was plenty of food and a good choice. My only complaint would be that parking was not free unlike most Dublin hotels. The air conditioning wasn't working but this wasn't an issue. There was only bedding and towels for 2 people but extras were sent to the room quickly. Not the most attractive location but I would definately stay again",4,2014,07,16
249,Family friendly!,"Just back from a two night family package. Our deal included bed & breakfast on both mornings, 3 course evening meal for 2 adults & 2 kids & tickets to tayto park. Hotel room well located on ground floor, no issues with noise at all & ready on time. Family room clean & spacious enough for 2 adults, 2 kids & baby. Heat unbearable but fan in situ so just kept that on! Breakfast nice just go early to avoid queues. Pool nice, area & changing rooms kept warm which was great especially with young baby. Staff all very helpful & friendly. Meal at Synergie restaurant was really lovely! This place is extremely family friendly, would happily return again.",4,2014,07,15
249,Nice hotel,LOvely hotel with comfortable beds and great bathroom. Breakfast very tasty but depleted fast when busy. Staff were friendly and helpful. Only problem is it is hard to get at with public transport from downtown. Would stay here again.,5,2014,07,14
249,A busy hotel that caters very well for families,"I just stayed for 1 night in this hotel with my husband and 3 yr old as we were visiting Dublin Zoo. It's a very child-friendly hotel and many families use it for trips to the zoo or the Tayto park so expect kids everywhere if you're coming here! My daughter loved the pool and the little indoor play area was very useful for filling in time and giving us a bit of a breather. There is also an outdoor playground that we didn't get time to use. The kids club sounds amazing but if your children are under 6 you can't leave them there unaccompanied so for us it wasn't much use. I can understand why they would have that rule though as it would be harder to supervise younger kids. The family room we had was very clean, contemporary and comfortable. I was impressed and it is obviously a well kept hotel with good quality rooms. Size-wise it was big enough but I've stayed in more spacious family rooms which were better as in this one it was impossible not to waken my daughter just from the slightest noise. The hotel also suffers from that strange airless, dry heat that some hotels have. We didn't have a great sleep because of the unpleasant heat. There were fans in the rooms but we couldn't keep that on for sleeping as it was too noisy. There is some noise from the nightclub across the carpark but it was very faint and didn't bother us. A few disrespectful guests screeched a bit in the corridor but I wouldn't really say it was a particularly noisy hotel in that respect after lights out. So many families I guess that most people were in bed early! 

We witnessed a bit of chaos in the foyer during peak check-in time from around 2pm. We actually arrived at 12pm and registered at that point before going off to the Liffey Valley shopping centre (which is amazing by the way) to wait for a room to be ready. I would recommend that approach if you have the time as it seemed to guarantee us a room when we came back at 2. There were other people around who had a long wait - some didn't get rooms until after 4pm. A few were taking their frustration out on the staff - I think the staff in here appear to be doing a great job in the circumstances. Everyone we encountered was professional and helpful and did everything with a smile on their faces. My perception of what's going wrong here is that the owners are trying to run a very large hotel on the number of staff that would be more suitable for a hotel half the size. It's quite typical of a big corporate chain like Clarion to try and increase the profit margin by scrimping on staff costs so it doesn't surprise me - I wish these companies would recognise that they have great staff and if they want to have a great hotel they need to have enough of them and pay them well :) 

We ate dinner in the Kudos restaurant because we were too tired to go looking for anything else and were pleasantly surprised. For an average-looking Asian fusion place the food was actually pretty tasty - quality chicken breast in my dish rather than the processed stuff you sometimes get, and a nice black bean sauce that wasn't too salty. It was slightly too expensive though and the drinks in the bar are also higher than average Dublin prices. Being such a large and busy hotel, breakfast can be crazy - they even have a warning poster using a traffic lights system to show you the time slots that tend to have the worst queues. We came down at around 9am and it was noisy and busy but I didn't have to queue at all. By the time we were leaving 30 minutes later the queue to get in was massive. Again, I think this hotel has crossed a threshold in terms of size when they really need to think about things like having a second restaurant for breakfasts. But instead of doing something like that to improve the guest experience they'd rather just warn you that if you want to eat fast you should get up early. Really it makes me feel like this hotel is all about generating as much profit as possible and keeping the costs low.

I wanted to mention that the wifi works really well everywhere in the hotel - it can be so frustrating to have wifi that never works so it's worth noting this place does wifi very well. Finally, the location of this hotel while handy to the city and other attractions, is ugly. Don't be expecting a nice view or anywhere to go for a walk. It's somewhere to eat, sleep and have your kids entertained, and it is pretty good at that.",3,2014,07,13
249,Busy hotel in a handy location,Stayed here for a trip to Dublin Zoo. Very Family orientated hotel...has a nice pool. Room was extremely hot and had no air conditioning only a fan in the corner which was loud to have on all night. Glad we didn't have breakfast here as there was a huge queue to get into the dining room at 9.30am.,4,2014,07,13
249,Great hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights for medical reasons while I was heavily pregnant and I have to say the service was fantastic. We were upgraded to an apartment at no extra charge which had a large bedroom, kitchenette, large wardrobe and french door to a decking area. This was fantastic as it gave us so much space and allowed us to have lunch in our room when we didn't feel like going out. We had breakfast and dinner included in our package with today fm breaks which was great value. The restaurant staff in both restaurants were lovely and couldn't do enough for us. It's only 8km from the city centre and right next to liffey valley shopping centre. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,12
249,Great for families,"The hotel was lovely our family room was very clean! The kids playground and indoor play area's were great their was plenty for them to do as I have an 8,5 and 3 year old the swimming pool was a bit basic but fine! The breakfast was great and the evening meal was lovely but very small especially the main course both myself and my husband orderd the 8oz steak it wasn't very filling! Your charged for car parking which I think is unnecessary as it is underground! And if you want to lock your belongings in a locker when you go swimming it's a €5 charge for a lock but you'll get your deposit back when you return the lock!",4,2014,07,12
249,Disappointed,"Stayed a few times here, for work and for leisure, checked in at 4pm waited for 20min at reception for a manager to let the receptionist get on with the check ins, even when a second receptionist asked them to stop and check in guests, the response she got was a bad look by the manager and a loud enough and lazy ya, and manager rolled his eyes while turning away!! Could understand this from staff but not management! ! Room was okay, and clean as it always is, only thing they are two phones in room 457 but only one works, went for coffee at 12:30 to the bar, it is now 12:54 and finally got a latte, staff where more interested in talking to a staff memeber that called in on day off with her child, there was a customer waitting with me, it took her 5 appempts to ask for soya milk answer she got was ""dont have it"" she asked for skimmed milk again no dont have it! She got a pot of tea, she got the cup and the bar staff poured the milk directly into the cup, saying we dont have any jugs left, so I have to pour your milk in cup! Seriously really ???? Staff are unorganised and dont know what they are doing, not all but most, the manager at front desk yesterday friday 11-07-2014 should get customer training and use common sense if he has it at all.
Would recommend this hotel when its busy, on weekdays or quiet weekends, by all means go to this hotel, the staff are friendly and help you with any request that they can, the food in restaurant and the bar are great, staff are a bit slow and when under pressure can come across as they never worked in a restaurant or bar in their life, but they try their best and are always friendly, it would be more down to the management not giving any training what so ever. ",2,2014,07,12
249,Child friendly,We recently stayed in the clarion at Liffey valley with our 8mth old & 2yr old. It was well catered for children with a nice clean indoor play area & outdoor area. Staff were v polite & helpful. We would stay again.,5,2014,07,08
249,Staff,"I have just arrived home from my stay and can say I am happy. The kids had an excellent time with the 'Kids Club' on through out our stay.. What was great was we brought them to the restaurant for dinner greeted by the host Shauna they were giving a table and we were then asked if we would like to go to the bar as it was supervised! After the dinner we went back to check on them and they could not stop talking about how nice the staff were. Nicole was looking after them and was so friendly to us and them. Nicole then showed the kids were the further entertainment was and booked us in for our own dinner later that evening, this is an excellent service in a hotel and the kids were delighted. Also we had a small problem with clean towels in the room and as soon as we called reception to fix the problem is was sorted and we had new towels in less then 15 minutes delivered by a lovely man(I think was duty manager) who was very apologetic. Over all I would be happy to come back as you are made feel very welcome by front desk on arrival and all staff throughout.",4,2014,07,08
249,Great Price,"I stayed at this hotel because it was a good location for where I needed to be based. it very well priced with a nice gym and pool. The food is very good, especially the salad/Baguette counter located near the bar. there is also a great cinema and shopping complex located just up the road.",4,2014,07,08
249,A fair hotel,A very noisy hotel. We were woken up a few times during the night with people talking and shouting down the  corridor. It is a short walk to liffy vally shopping centre and about a forty minute bus ride to the city centre.,3,2014,07,06
249,Loved this hotel,"This hotel is brilliant for children. We came here for my little boys 1st birthday.  There was an indoor kids play area and also an outside play area. The pool area is great, there was a smaller kids pool an then there was a large pool area. There was a jacuzzi , sauna an steam room.  The rooms are lovely, very luxurious with lots of room.  Nice and peaceful. Can't wait to come  here again.",5,2014,07,06
249,Ok,Stayed here a few times. Food on all occasions was of a very poor standard. Service was extremely bad. Waiting 15 minutes for a water jug. French fries for my steak came after I had finished my steak. Breakfast wasn't great either. Rooms are nice spacious and clean though. ,3,2014,07,06
249,Not sure yet...,"First of 3 nights, arrived late. After a wonderful night at Clarion Limerick we were a little disappointed. Our room was in the suites, not in the hotel, was right on the road. Since there was no air conditioning in the room we had to sleep with the windows open and the street noise was almost unbearable. The room itself was really nice the fan was a good idea but we've asked for a change of room for our next two nights. The manager on duty, Jaime, assured us we would have a quiet room in the hotel side, upon our return. So far this hotel seems more like a Quality than a Clarion but we shall see. The staff has been really helpful  and friendly. I'll write more after our next two nights. ",4,2014,07,06
249,Great for families,Stayed here for 2 nights with two small kids after a recommendation from friends. The hotel is nowhere near town and so you need the car to get to anywhere from there but for us (heading to the zoo) it was perfect. Rooms were a good size allowing for us to put in a travel cot but they were very very warm. We had a room overlooking the car park and while it was quiet we had to leave the window closed at night but had to keep the room fan going all night long to keep the room cool enough to get to sleep. For us though it was the way the hotel was set up for kids that made it great. The kids are made feel welcome and in the restaurant the staff were so kind & understanding to them. They bring out their food first etc. also there was cinema every night at 8 and a clown with face painting and balloons from 7-9pm one of the nights we were there - all for free! There is a good pool there and a big kids pool which was very clean. Theres also a play ground but we didnt get to see it . Food in the hotel was reasonably priced and excellent quality (ate there both nights). It is a busy hotel with lots of tour groups and so there will always be people returning to their rooms at all hours but overall we didn't find the room very noisy. For us this hotel worked and we will use it again as our base if we are in Dublin. ,4,2014,07,04
249,little bit tired but great staff,rooms and general décor a little in need of an update. Breakfast buffet okay but same every day which gets a bit boring after five days. Comfortable beds but room very warm however there was already a fan located in room. No booklet in room re hotel features and the TV menu that did show the hotel features was very hard to read. The pool not very large and under 18's not permitted after 7pm which was a bity of a bother considering they were paid for as adults. HOWEVER the friendliness and efficiency of the staff more than made up for any small erks.. Would certainly recommend for a short term stay.,4,2014,07,04
249,Great value for the price,"Stayed last Friday night, booked at last minute paid 79.00, wasn't too bad of a price.  Checked in quickly and efficiently.  Room on 3rd floor, lovely clean room.  Plenty of milk cartons, not a lot of sugar though, but not really a big problem.  Bed nice a comfy, I slept Ok, so no need to complain.  Went for a shower next morning, no shower hat, which I thought was a little odd.  
Overall experience was a good one, would I stay again YES.  But what I did not like was having to pay for parking @ 4.00 a night, bit of a rip off when the car park is under the hotel.  If your staying in the hotel it should be free parking.",4,2014,07,03
249,Family Meal,We enjoyed a family meal and drinks reception for my mams birthday on June 14th. The restaurant catered for 20 of us brilliantly. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful even though we insisted on dividing up the bill awkwardly!! The food was amazing. We spent the rest of the evening in the bar with extended family and luckily for us there was music on that night which was brill. My family took over the mic and we had a ball. The service in the bar was great. I would definitely come here again.,5,2014,07,02
249,Bed was too hard!,"checked in before 6am for a good night sleep... and the bed was hard as a rock!
breakfast was not the best! paid 15 euro for it and didnt enjoy it as much.
staff were alight and the location is good.. right off the N2.",3,2014,06,26
249,Good location and facilities for meetings,We had a work training event last weekend so only used the meeting facilities and restaurant.  Booking process and staff and follow up were very efficient and helpful and prices very reasonable.  The meeting room was very well equipped and room temp and layout perfect for us.  There is ample parking free for attendees on site.  So overall a good handy location for meetings if you have people coming from the south east or west of Ireland and want a meeting place near Dublin but not in the city centre. ,4,2014,06,25
249,Lovely apartment,"Stayed in a 2 bed apartment for 4 nights, it was very nice, spacious and like a home away from home. We were on the third floor and it was painfully hot with no air con (although a fan was supplied). Also very trivial but some channels on the telly weren't working. Have a lovely little playground for children. We have stayed in this hotel before and will stay again. ",3,2014,06,24
249,Excellent hotel ,"We stayed here in mid June for one night. Booked the room on booking.com and when we arrived we were upgraded to a complementary apartment suite! It was great, loads of space. Would defo recommend for anyone staying in Dublin :)",5,2014,06,22
249,Super hotel and fantastic staff!,"Stayed here for only quick night and have to say the staff were great, especially front desk Polish lady ( forgot her name) room was very comfortable, little confusing to get to, as the hotel is HUGE! 

Didn't eat here, but would have if the time had allowed.

I would definitiyy return, without a doubt, just hope the service would be the same!",5,2014,06,17
249,Mediocre ,First let's start by saying the surrounding amenities are great. It was unfortunate to be greeted a stone cold in welcoming staff member named Maria. Our booking was not found and was asked repeatedly if our name was someone's different which we repeatedly replied no. Maria then said that there was no booking and that she would have to create a new one. She presented us with a price quite more expensive than what was booked on booking.com. After already showing her the booking reference and price we insisted that the price originally quoted be honoured. Maria hesitantly allowed this. The room we were given was satisfactory despite it being uncomfortably warm even with the supplied fan. What modern hotel doesn't have climate control in room? The room was clean but the seating area table where accumulated dust had been. Evidence that the cleaning staff obviously had not cleaned this for several days. We decided to use the spa facilities and surprised by the deposit of €10 for the privilege to use a lock for our lockers. I think the holding into our room key would of sufficed... The pool area was occupied by a water aerobics class. While attempting to relax in the jacuzzi the instructor similar to a drill sergeant was yelling at his class attendees. Less relaxing spa experience than expected. In today's day and age a company as world renowned as Clarion should have some training for front of house staff on how they expect there customers to be treated. The cold unwelcoming demeanour that clarion staff portrayed during initial contact was lacking completely. Further staff retraining would be a good idea.,1,2014,06,14
249,worst night in a  hotel ever !!NO SLEEP,"I spend at least 1 night a month in hotels so I know what im talking about. You want to sleep dont stay here!!!The worst night I have spent in any hotel in Ireland. Noise is an understatement . I would like to give people a run down of my night . 9pm - 12pm Atrocious noise from the room next door. 12pm - 4am Disgraceful noise from the pub across the road from the hotel - fights -screaming and roaring-cars racing - spinning wheels- handbreak turns- falling about drunk . 
4am - 5am The stag night coming back to the hotel - why would you put a stag night in the same corridor as family rooms ?????? 
4.30am -5.30am This was the most incredible thing to me - a member of staff from the hotel loading up luggage on to a trolley for a bus tour that was leaving early !!!! outside my door???? Truthfully I and my wife had absolutely no sleep whatsoever in this hotel .Verdict is you'd be insane to stay here. Click next hotel and stay there.",1,2014,06,12
249,Has it improved?,"As per my last review about 12 months ago - has it improved? Still good value for the money paid but just seems tired.

Room fine except for a noise that started at 0600 waking me up - constant sound of a large ciston filling.....complained on check out but gentlemen on reception didn't seem interested.

Breakfast again no better really - I was down at 0700 and still no papers - place seemed a bit scruffy - vinyl seats in the middle sticky and covered in crumbs - not each coffee jugs to go round. Orange juice no better.........

Bar & Kudos area do seem better though......

Will stay here again but only because it is so convenient for work.......",3,2014,06,10
249,Great hotel ,"Stayed here with my wife and 2 kids as my wife was doing the mini marathon and had a fantastic time ,couldn't fault anything ,family room was perfect 3 beds and a fan also in the room ,staff were lovely ,had a room overlooking the motorway but once the window was closed it was silenced ,definitely will be back ",5,2014,06,03
249,FANTASTIC....,"Highly recommend, hotel spotless staff very friendly and helpful, I've a dietary need and chef warren was more than welcome to accommodate me the food was fab, swimming pool was great and hotel is so close to a huge shopping centre and on the bus route to the city centre. will be making another visit,",5,2014,06,02
249,excellent,"Stayed in the hotel in April and once again ,it was very  enjoyable.From when we arrived in the hotel until we left. We were on an over night special with the dinner included for 2 adults and the 2 kids . Dinner in the non Asian restaurant was superb and a three dinner was most enjoyable . Last time we were overlooking the M50 which was noisy. This time we were overlooking the front of the hotel and was much quieter. Would certainly once again , recommend you to stay in the hotel . If i had to give a critisism on the hotel,it would have to be the time the leisure centre deck was unattended down stairs and around the pool. Would still stay based on everything else.",4,2014,06,01
249,Must go to a great experience,We went up for the June bank holiday weekend and were greeted by the friendly staff rooms were suberb it's a 5 star hotel at 4 star prices if you ask me the bar!!!! We had the best night of our lives at night the kitchen staff wear Mexican hats and come out around to every table and don't leave unless you tell then a song to play its the best experience of my life listen if your a German or American tourist or from anywhere in you must go ! Only down side it's a bit out about 10 minutes out of the main city but it is a must go ,5,2014,05,31
249,Family package deal,"We book the two night package with a trip to the zoo, then added an extra night. This was great for us. It is a big hotel and can get quite busy at breakfast time, however if you are not in a rush you can go later towards the end of breakfast. Although we had to wait to re lay the table this was done promptly, breakfast is self service. Issues were dealt with quickly - our kettle broke and a ring to reception it was sorted within minutes. Some staff looked quite fed up at times, we had the dinner which just on its own is good value for the kids.  Bar drinks were reasonable and so was the European menu. I would need to say that the extra deposits for changing rooms and car parking and deposit for the room need to be detailed more clearly, as these can catch people out. Bus stop it a 10minute walk from the hotel up by the shopping centre. We had a room facing the N4/M50 on the ground floor, and yes there was background noise but it wasn't too bad, generally noise was minimal, sometimes you could hear the heating water systems but these are not permanent. Bathroom marble was a little stained but for the amount of time we were in the hotel we could live with it. Having the safe in the room was great. Overall an enjoyable holiday. We stayed when the Irish schools were still open so it was lovely and quiet.",3,2014,05,31
249,To far from main attractions in Dublin,"I want to start by saying its been a few years since I stayed here. It was before I started writing reviews. So I know it won't be fair to write about the actually hotel stay since my memory about it isn't too clear anymore. However, I want ""first time Dublin travelers"" to know this is pretty far from the main attractions in Dublin. Such as the Dublin Castle, The Christ Church and all the fun pubs in the Temple Bar area! A group of 22 Americans stayed here and we were talking 20-30 minute cabs back and forth all day!! The public bus is cheap but takes over an hour to get there!!! My advice is to spend a little more money on a hotel closer to downtown so you can save on cabs!!",3,2014,05,28
249,Concert Visit,"Just back from Clarion Liffey Valley, our second visit, a very busy property this past weekend with three One Direction Concerts on in Croke Park so Check In Area was extremely busy with no rooms available until later, upon return later our room was ready fairly quickly and credit to the staff member who dealt with us as the staff where obviously under some severe pressure, Great Sized Family room with standard decoration no complaints really, for light sleepers some of the hotel does back onto a fairly busy road, we travel with ear plugs so we're always prepared, used the Pool with the kids and some super staff dealt with us over there too. PARKING, a bit of a bugbear with me unfortunately, I dont understand the need to charge for it outside of busy city centre hotels where space is at a premium, here with plenty of space I expect my parking free as a money paying guest, add to that the fact that they give minimum free time before charges and then an overnight charge as well means parking adds up e8.00 per day which is unnecessary in my opinion",3,2014,05,27
249,Excellent break away!!,"Stayed for the One Direction concert, two adults and two kids. We received an executive double room when we checked in which was a nice surprise. The room was clean and comfortable and had a separate sitting room and a fully equipped kitchenette. The kids enjoyed the swimming pool. I would definitely use this hotel the next time in Dublin.",5,2014,05,26
249,Would not recommend,"We stayed at this hotel on the 25/05/2014 for the one direction concert, this is not our first time staying at the hotel either and we said we would give it one more chance. We were travelling with one child so needed a triple room. when we tried to check in at 2.00 when we arrived I was told the room was not ready and would be a few mins ( we requested an early check in ) We went to the bar to wait and after three failed attempts finally got to order. When our drinks came the waitress (who was there on are last visit and just as bad) proceeded to put my glass of wine in front of the child and the 7up in front of my sister and the other wine to me, even though she could see this was a child, when the food came we asked for mayonnaise and the waiter took it off a table of people who had just finished eating and said will this do I don't think they have touched it !!  two hours later we got our room which we spent 20 mins in cause we needed to leave. The next morning cleaning arrived at 11 to clean the room ( 2 hours late getting the room and they wanted to clean it an hour early) the hotel was not cheap for the night and the customer service is terrible and the worst thing is that it is not a one off cause we have been before, but gave it another chance mostly for travel convenience, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone again.",1,2014,05,26
249,One Direction weekend treat,"16 in our group and hotel was packed to capacity, on arrival it took time checking in because of all the guest arriving for the concert but the staff was great. The hotel provides transport into Dublin for concerts so when booking reserve your seat it is a much better way to travel into Dublin in busy traffic. The kudos bar also had a money saving menu for pre Dinner shows  and the kids enjoyed it. Plenty of staff in the Kudos  bar on our second night must say Aiofe was great. They made up vegetarian options of all meals on the menu, the staff at the Sinergie restaurant also on site  where not so friendly I have to say. leisure center is great and water a good temperature, changing facilities brilliant with under floor heating, you can get ready in comfort, kids can stay in pool up until 7 pm.  The  Liffey Valley Shopping center is a short walk 10 to 15 mins depending on level of fitness, a great range of shops and a good selection in the food court, KFC, mc Donnels, o Briens and noddles bars along side gourmet  burgers. there is also a huge  cinema this added to the weekend family break away as kids do not like shopping much. We will be booking again a great hotel.",4,2014,05,25
249,Unbelievable! And not in a good way.,"It's rare I'd bother write a review on trip advisor and even rarer I'd bother with someplace local. Went for a glass of wine to a very unjazzy bar, the que for a drink was 4 people with 4 bar staff.  None of them interested. If they'd even acknowledge you as they ambled by, you might let it slide but to be ignored for close to 10 mins while they work at a snails pace was unreal. Service was a disgrace. Upon mentioning it I was informed they were busy. 4 people buying drinks. The wine was 7.50 a glass to add insult to injury. Never again.",1,2014,05,25
249,Great family friendly hotel,"Just back from an overnight stay at liffey valley, 2 adults and 3 children up in Dublin for 1D concert. Hotel was buzzing with iD fans of all ages.  Although we had to wait 2 hours for our room to be ready, we just went across to the shopping centre 5 mins away.  Our room was excellent, we had an exectutive room, cant fault it at all, more than comfortable for the 5 of us.  Had to queue for about 4 or 5 mins for breakfast, which was fine considering how many residents where in the hotel, breakfast was excellent, staff were very helpful in all areas of the hotel, underground parking also very good, quite generous parking spaces compared to other hotels, and very reasonable at £4.00 for 24 hours.  kids enjoyed the pool, remember to bring swimming caps if you have some, however they are available to buy at £3.00, towels were also provided. We will definitely be returning to this hotel if we come back to Dublin in the future.  well done to the staff considering how many kids running around.",5,2014,05,25
249,Never again,"Upon my arrival everything was grand room sparkling clean, then I went down to enquire about the restaurants evening menu and I was told that the restaurant was closed due to a conference being held. Clearly their is other people to be accommodated for not to be pushed aside and unwelcomed. My room was situated beside a lift and Double doors that were continuously being opened and banged shut and also loud French people shouting passing by my room throughout the evening and in the middle night  and then in morning Chinese was being shouted loudly  to and fro in the hallway, people go away for the night to chill out and have a nice meal and relax however my stay was non of the above. ",1,2014,05,22
249,Great hotel. Reccomend staying here,"The rooms are large and comfortable. Staff wee helpful in resolving an issue we had and we were able to change rooms with no fuss at all. The restaurant menu is extensive and there is great variety. Parking is not included with the room for guests, but it was not overly expensive.   
We've stayed here a number of times and each occasion has gone smoothly. ",5,2014,05,20
249,Great hotel,"Had a 3 night stay in a three bedded family room.
Plenty of tv channels for the kids and the modern led tv took a usb drive so they could watch their own films too.
Plenty of parking at a reasonable 4euros per 24 hours.
Going to dublin we drove to Phoenix park.Parked for free and took the tour bus into and arround the city, a much cheaper option than city centre parking.
If you want to use the pool you need to wear a swimming cap, bring your own if you wish to save the 3 euro charge of buying one from the leisure centre.",5,2014,05,19
249,Did there best in a bad situation,"Booked to stay here on the 16th May but when I got to the hotel at 1am I was told my room was flooded. Was annoyed at not being informed of this until I got to the hotel but the gentleman Adrian had reassured me that I would have a room for the night with breakfast and transport to it in a nearby hotel. Had to wait around for the taxi and the complimentary pint helped this but as promised I was delivered to the nearby hotel and brought back the next morning. I thought in the circumstances the hotel was in ,they handled everything very well and where very pleasant. The next day I used the gym and dining area in the hotel and I have to rate the staff very highly on there friendliness. I can understand how people might be angry in this scenario but these things happen and there is only so much the hotel can do. I have to say I was pleased at the way it was handled, Adrian was very helpful and very reassuring which helped immensely. I would like to get the chance to stay here because of the staff and location and maybe I will some day but overall I was happy with the service even though I didn't stay in the hotel.",4,2014,05,19
249,1 night family break away,"We stayed here on last minute family break away,great value was the dinner for 2 adult 2 kids & cinemna tickets for all for €70 I thought was best value of all. Hotel location good , only down fall was bar looks ( staff great) but bar looks like Spanish bar very open no character to it , wud love see re vamp of bar to a traditional looking bar & seating area wud be a massive asset to hotel , other than that good service good hotel great location ",3,2014,05,19
249,Terrible service and organisation,"Booked that hotel because was better rated and looked nicer than Green Isle nearby. Arrived at 1am at night, ready to check in, tired as you can imagine and hungry like hell. Very tied on the schedule for the next day as well. And at the check in guy is coming out of the back office not even introducing himself (his name was Adrian as I spotted on the name label, but what was his position- ???) is asking us to the site because he has good and bad news for us. Can you imagine at 1am at night such a thing? So he started, that hotel was flooded and they have 40 rooms out of service, bla bla bla and the bad news is that they do not have room for us, and they will organise transport for us to Green Isle hotel. So we asked where is the good news then? I didnt know if I should laugh or cry at this point. And Adrian told us that they were trying to get in touch with us- oh really we said - dear guests dont you ever believe in such a rubbish! if they wanted to get in touch with us they would- as we booked hotel thru booking.com and all our details like emails and 2 phone numbers are there, so please mister late night receptionist do not tell me how hard you tried to get in touch with us, especially that your hotel was not flooded the same night we arrived, because it happened few days before. So all together Clarion hotel didnt bother to contact us, and was just waiting and praying that we wont arrive? Very disappointed, definitely not going to stay with Clarion Hotel and I am not recommending it to anyone. Used to work in 4 star hotel and we did anything to get in touch asap with guests when things like that happened!",2,2014,05,18
249,Excellent food and good value included Tayto Pk,"Stayed there May weekend with 10 other families and we had a great time.  Price was great value and included Tayto park tickets which was great.

The best thing about this hotel was the excellent food, really lovely in both the bar and restaurant.  I am giving the excellent for the food alone.  Staff were friendly, great with kids.

Certainly was a great weekend for us.",5,2014,05,15
249,Stay somewhere else,"I stayed here for one night, pictures on website do the hotel a lot of justice! Rooms are incredibly hot, uncomfortably hot. They have no air conditioning just an electric fan that makes a lot of noise. My advice..Look elsewhere, for the money your paying it's not worth it!",2,2014,05,14
249,Stopped By To Meet A Friend,"I live in Dublin and I came here to meet a friend, before that I had got lost and had a very stressful day and my battery was dying. So when I came to the bar I was approached my a tall, young Irish woman with brown hair, who had a great smile on her face. I told her my situation with my phone and my friend coming soon, as I ordered a glass of house wine so she helped me find a comfy seat out in the lobby with a plug near by so I can charge my phone next to me and keep in contact with my friend, which was her idea. She was so nice and helpful and wanted nothing in return. I was very impressed by her and felt great after she left, the wine might have helped as well. Also the parking was free for the time I had stayed here and the atmosphere in the hotel was lovely altogether. I will definitely be returning to this place.",5,2014,05,08
249,not for familys,ok where to start just got back home from this place 5/5/2014 after a three night stay rooms were good but the heat was unreal could not sleep and if we opened the window the noise would have woken our son ......we went to the only bar they have to get something to eat ...what can i say the menu was not for english or irish people and no kids menu  we could not get any food for our son as he would not eat foreign food we had to go to the shopping centre to burger king and so on which may i add you have to pay to get out the car park everytime and to walk to the shopping centre was a good 15 mins walk through a not very nice place as we walk upon drunks  and felt not safe as you were in a open area with no one around if you ran into trouble ...so there after we had to take car everytime and pay to get out on the last night we just wanted to go home but seeing we paid we stayed and was gone early in the morning ...this place is only for airport stays and one night only NOT FOR FAMILYS HOILDAYS ....,1,2014,05,06
249,Great hotel and fun stay,"We drove into the underground car park (€4 charge overnight) and made our way via the lift to reception. It's great to go from car park to reception without having to go outside. Check-in took 2/3 minutes all pleasant and friendly despite check in being very busy. We were asked if we needed help with our bags: we said we didn't. We were invited to book for dinner by the receptionist, she said that 7pm & 7:30pm were already both booked out. Excellent, I love a busy restaurant as it gives food turnover and keeps food fresh and as it's my birthday I'm relaxed and this is one of a few hotels we are hopping too around the country. We had a ground floor room, which was quite a bit of a walk to reach through six yes six sets of doors and at door number six we began to re-think maybe we should have taken help with the luggage as it's no fun hauling cases through many doors! Thought I was in Dublin airport walking to get a Ryanair flight!! The room was a great size with a very large comfy bed, the extra pillows we booked by email were on the bed and there was a modern large flat screen telly with lots of channels to view. There were ample plug sockets, a decent mirror and two pleasant pictures on the walls. The bathroom delivered almost instant hot water. We also had a small balcony overlooking a field - very pleasant. Time for a mug yes a mug of tea in the room. Dublin water is scummy as you can see from the tea cup if you take tea without milk but that's not the fault of the hotel. We did read some disparaging TripAdvisor reviews but thankfully we didn't see any evidence of the matters being raised there. Also this is our third stay here in recent years and we've never encountered such problems. So to dining. We had the 3 course evening dinner at €25. The restaurant was very busy so we focussed on the cocktail menu. We had a caipirinha cocktail with Brazil's booze cachaça, sugar, mint and lime and a tequila & Cointreau Margarita (€8 each) and each was so superb we ordered another two. Believe me the cocktail menu is worth exploring. Each of us had the salmon & crab tian starter on a bed of salad and a balsamic reduction dressing - scrummy. Bread rolls and butter on the side. A sea bass main and roast stuffed chicken main, with a bowl of good chips on the side; the sea bass served with a red pepper sauce reduction, delicious intense tasting sweet potatoes, veg of carrot, asparagus and Thai baby corn wrapped in a steamed piece of leek and excellent. The chicken had a good mushroom sauce. Good desserts of white chocolate & raspberry mousse and a cappuccino cake as the first choice of meringue nests was sadly done at 6:45pm. After food we decamped to the seating around reception with our second cocktails, relaxed, to watch busy people in a hurry. Then to quiet bed. There was quite a queue for breakfast in the morning but it moved quickly. Breakfast was standard Irish fare: sausage, scrambled egg, bacon, black & white pudding, beans, tomatoes and rosti potatoes. Also cereals, cold meats, fruit salad, fruit juices, teas, coffee. Despite it being very busy service was very good and check out was as painless as check - in. Great and friendly staff and service throughout our stay. Mega comfy mega clean throughout too. If I'd change anything I'd improve the coffee and the flavour of breakfast coffee.

249,Lunch restaurant,I'm not someone who usually chooses a hotel restaurant for a lunch time stop off but I was pleasantly surprised by my recent visit. The staff were all very helpful and attentive. Proactively cleaning the table before they took our order and promptly both serving the food and clearing the plates away afterwards. Good value and good food served in a timely manner. Just what you need when you only have a 1 hour lunch break.,4,2014,05,02
249,Good value for Dublin,"This hotel is situated just off the M50 near Lucan at the junction with the N4. There is a dual carriageway straight into the city passing Heuston railway station, and there is a bus stop near the hotel in an easy 10 minute walk with a frequent service to the city centre. Breakfast is served from 6.30am and provides a good selection. The hotel is a modern functional hotel but has plenty of parking, swimming pool and all the usual facilities a modern hotel provides. The staff are most helpful and friendly and do their best to sort out any problems. The restaurant and bar are popular. The hotel suited us for its ease of access and price. We stayed on the third floor with a good view of the main road but with the window closed there was no traffic noise, and with it open just a background hum at peak times. The hotel clearly appeals to families with children.",5,2014,04,29
249,Please read this before you book this hotel !,"Stayed at the hotel for three nights 12/04/14 - 15/04/14 with husband and two children aged 12 & 6.

POSITIVES 

Family friendly, kids allowed in bar and restaurant.( I appreciate that this might not be a plus for everyone as there seemed to be a lot of kids!)

Good food in bar and restaurant, if a little pricey. Bar serves Asian cuisine but also offers small selection of light bites.  Good choice in restaurant. Kids menu is the same in both bar and restaurant and pleased both kids. Service ok in both. Also good breakfast served in restaurant, but be aware you will have to wait for a table at busy times.

Good leisure facilities but let down by lack of cleanliness. Orange peel and empty bottles lying in sauna on day of arrival and still there on day of departure. Also be aware that the pool depth is 1.4 m throughout. Our six year old can swim but was not able to stand up safely as the water level was over his head, which meant that either one of us had to be in the pool with him or he had to wear armbands. There is a toddler pool but six year old did not want to ""play with the babies.""  Half of the pool was roped off for swimming lengths which didn't leave a lot of room for kids to play. However the kids did enjoy their time in the pool.

NEGATIVES

ROOM NOT AVAILABLE ON ARRIVAL.

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE

FILTHY BEDDING

 I had booked directly with hotel back in January as I wanted a nice room for our stay as it was for husband's 40th birthday. I booked executive room with separate bedroom and sofa bed for kids at a cost of 124 euro/night b&b. We arrived at 4pm and were informed by the manager that our room had been double booked and the only room available was a family room with a double and two single beds all in one room. Our other room would be ready the next morning. He offered dinner for 4 of us by way of compensation. This was a take it or leave it offer as there were no other rooms available. Executive room still not available next morning after breakfast. As we were heading out for the day we were told to pack our luggage, leave it in our room and when we got back it would be moved to our new room. We arrived back just before 5pm and got the key for our new room, intending to use pool and spa facilities before heading out for dinner. Arrived at new room 652, no luggage! It took reception 10 minutes to answer the phone, then another hour to find and deliver our luggage. This left us just an hour for the spa as kids have to be out of the pool by 7pm.
 After returning from spa and having a shower discovered no hair dryer in the room. Tried to contact reception, no answer after 15 minutes, so went down to reception, with hair now half dried and standing on end! Waited further 15 minutes in line before speaking to an extremely rude and petulant receptionist who did not believe there was no hair dryer and was going to send  someone to check. Asked to speak to manager and told him I was not happy with standard of service we had received since arriving at the hotel. He offered a pitiful apology and obviously could not have cared less. He told me that the reason our room was double booked was that websites keep selling rooms even after the hotel is fully booked. When  i told him I had booked directly with the hotel months ago he had no answer. This seems to be an ongoing problem as we overheard other guests at reception having the same experience as us. Hair dryer arrived 15 minutes later. By this stage my hair had completely dried and I had to re wash it. It was also now too late to go out for dinner as we had intended and we were resigned to dining in. A small problem which should have taken only minutes to resolve had taken over an hour!

We returned to our room after dinner. I looked for bedding for the sofa bed and could only find pillows and a duvet with no cover and no sheets. I contacted reception and asked if someone could come and make up the bed. While we were waiting we pulled out the bed and were horrified at what we saw. The mattress on the bed was absolutely filthy and covered in stains. I was disgusted. Please see attached photographs, would you want to sleep on this bed? A young girl from house keeping arrived along with the manager I had spoken to earlier. I asked him to come in to see the mattress. He was speechless. He said he would try to find another mattress straight away and they both left the room. Half an hour later, with both boys getting tired and wanting to go to bed, the girl from housekeeping arrived back, and told us there was no other mattress but that she would put a mattress cover on for tonight and the mattress would be replaced the next day. It was now late at night and we had no other choice but to agree. As my husband and I got into our bed we discovered that our duvet did not fit the bed, it barely reached the edges of the bed. We also discovered that it was not a king size bed but two single beds pushed together creating a ridge down the middle of the bed. By this time we were beyond cross and felt that there was no point in complaining.

On our way to breakfast the next morning there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke on the ground floor of our building despite the obvious signs all over the hotel that smoking is not permitted.

We went out for the day expecting that when we returned the mattress on the sofa bed would have been changed. It was not. In fact house keeping had made the bed, ignoring the stains on the mattress. I was very disappointed and felt at this stage that there was absolutely no point in complaining as it was obvious that no one had taken any notice of our complaint the previous evening and no one had bothered to find another mattress.

Having gone to bed at about 11pm we were rudely awakened at 2.40am by the fire alarm sounding in our room. I checked in the corridor to see if anyone was leaving and saw several other sleepy eyed guests doing the same. My six year old boy was very distressed thinking that the building was on fire. I phoned reception and was told that the alarm had been set off by someone smoking in our building and that they had been removed from the hotel. This seemed a little strange as it was only a matter of a few minutes from the alarm sounding to me contacting reception. The alarm stopped, but my little boy was still very unsettled and I had to stay in the room with him until he fell asleep quite some time later. I got back to bed at 4am and had a very unsettled sleep.

Was asked at checkout if we had enjoyed our stay! If I had not been so tired and angry I would have laughed. Spoke to manager called Neil who kindly discounted our bill by 124 euro and assured me that all of these issues would be addressed. I remain unconvinced.

In addition to our own personal experience you need to note the following points before booking:-

LOCATION - POOR. The bus stop is not a five minute stroll away, it is a brisk 10 minute walk and not a pleasant one, through an industrial estate and beside a dual carriageway. The bus takes at least 25 minutes into the city centre. There is a constant supply of taxis at the hotel but a trip into the city centre will cost about  20 euro.

The view from your room will either be the hotel car park and a local housing estate or waste ground and an industrial estate or a busy dual carriageway and a roundabout.

The noise from the dual carriageway is intrusive at best and at night, the noise from local boy racers is worse.

Overall the negatives definitely outweighed the positives for us. What was meant to be a relaxing family trip to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday was ruined.

I emailed a complaint to customer_feedback@choicehotels.com and the reply was that this hotel is an independently owned and privately managed property under a franchise agreement with Choice Hotels. They have to comply with strict guidelines and standards and are inspected on a regular basis.

In my opinion this hotel deserves neither the Clarion name nor the four stars it has been awarded.",2,2014,04,26
249,Wonderful Hotel,"Spent a night here with my son and 2 grandchildren on a visit to Dublin, I could not praise it enough. Room excellent, kids enjoyed swimming pool, breakfast was very good, kids enjoyed choosing different foods. Would say its the best value for money I have had.",5,2014,04,25
249,Great break,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights Han had a wonderful time the staff on check in we're fast and efficient and I quickly learned this was a trait throughout the hotel even at nights when I had to check out early john on the desk was most pleasant and friendly 
Can't wait to return and look forward to my next visit",5,2014,04,25
249,Awful stay,"If you look at my reviews i don't give out but this place was awful. got to reception to check in and was informed I had to pay up front. Didn't mind that. Then out of the blue I was informed I had to pay a €50 cash deposit up front. Now I don't read all the terms and conditions of a room but this should be clearly stated when booking the hotel especially if they want cash up front because not many people carry cash around now. Arrived at the room and it was very stuffy and the heat was unreal. Was sweating straight away and searched the room but we had no air conditioning. Instead we got a large fan which made unreal noise. The bed sheets were all strained and the cushions too. Shower curtain was moled at the bottom. Had to left the room with all windows opened because of the heat. Ate in Kudos that was the only high point of the place. food was lovely. at night we went back to the room and closed windows. Within ten minutes the room was roasting again. now trying to sleep was the biggest problem. Couldn't sleep because of the heat, could open the window because of the noise of traffic and our air conditioning(the fan) was even louder. so a relaxing night in the clarion was not had. could wait to check out only for a check out we had to wait 15 minutes for our room to be checked before we got our deposit back. Add the four euro charge for parking and boom you have the worst hotel I have personally every stayed in and it will take some beating",1,2014,04,23
249,Staff seem suicidal,"Stayed here for one night, the weekend before Easter.  Firstly, the positives: I booked this hotel on the basis that it had a kids pool, and this was excellent. The Room was quite large - double bed, single bed and a table with chairs. Kids eat free on Sundays, when an adult is buying a main meal - all good for families. 

The negatives: 
the mattresses were really soft - very uncomfortable
there were areas of the spa(tiles), which looked visibly dirty 
every member of staff we encountered during our stay seemed depressed, except one girl on check out. This was really off putting. A smile now and then, wouldn't go amiss...
The room was way too hot. Even when I turned off the radiator, I had to open the window, and given that it's next to the M50... this didn't leave to a good night's sleep
Breakfast is self-serve, which is fine but they need to be quicker at providing tea/coffee. I waited 10 minutes to get mine. 

The food in the bar and for breakfast was okay - not amazing, but good value.",3,2014,04,22
249,Not great,"This is not a 4 star hotel and is overpriced for what you get.  Our room was a suite with chunks gone out of the furniture and old cigarette burns on the bedside furniture.  4 star hotels do not have chunks out of furniture or large cracks in the tiles in the bathroom.  The room was large, breakfast was a bit of a dog fight but ok, and the location was okay for us. But I am looking for a more for my money and this hotel did not offer the standard I would expect of 4 stars.",2,2014,04,22
249,Didn't Appeal To Me,"I stayed here on the direction of a colleague to save a long drive through Dublin city centre in the rush hour. Check in was reasonably friendly and efficient. However, I'd booked a double room because I really don't like single rooms in hotels - they tend to be very small - but found my otherwise large double room also had a made up single bed crammed in, which was very annoying. It was also depressing to see a large brown stain on the pillow on the single bed, which must have been easily visible to whoever made up the bed. If I'd needed the single bed for a child, I'd have been very disappointed.

The room otherwise was OK, except the bathroom floor was one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen - hard, matt, rough grey tiles, which showed the dirt very badly.

I didn't eat in the hotel, but in the nearby Arc pub, which was adequate. A colleague and I then had a brief drink in the hotel bar, which was noisy and had numbers of children running around.

The stay was then rendered even less appealing by the fire alarm going off at 02:30 in the morning. Fortunately it went off again very quickly but by then the damage had been done.

So overall, not a great stay and I'd not choose to stay here again unless I absolutely had to - there are far too many nicer hotels in the centre of Dublin at comparable prices.",3,2014,04,19
249,Child friendly,Everything you need for kids fab kids pool. Kids club on holidays teenage games room. Food nice and not too expensive. Kids playground on sight. And right beside shopping centre with a cinema and pirates village kids loved it. Bus stop 5 mins walk that brings you into the city.,5,2014,04,15
249,Zoo trip ,"We stayed in the Clarion for one night with our two small kids . Had to wait a bit at check in because there where only two people at reception and they had to answer also the phone in the back office . In front of us was a family with two kids that had booked a double room , they insisted their kids could sleep in their bed with them ( 8 and 10 years ) and they did not want to pay extra for a bigger room . That scared me of cause we also had two kids ( 2 and 8 month ) . They offered us a room with 3 beds for no extra cost . Room was of good size , beds comfy and bath with plenty of hot water , clean room and bathroom . Pool was fantastic , clean changing area with extra cabins for changing , playpen to put small child in while you change . Daughter loved the pool ( plenty of kids as it was start of Easter Holliday ) . Now to come to what we didn't like : As my husband and I are both chefs we know about food . We checked the restaurant menu and it was very basic and quiet small . We decided to eat in the Kudos bar witch has Asian menu . We had the combo starter for two witch was ok . However the mains where horrible . Husband had fish cakes for main ( 4 burned fish cakes with a tiny bit of cold noodles ) , he said they where tasteless too . I had duck in some kind of Asian sauce with noodles . The noodles had no taste at all while the Asian sauce was soo salty that you could barely eat it . Was better when you mixed it with the pasta . Kids food was ok . Our waiter was very nice and helpful . What made me so angry about the food was that it was not busy at all and a kitchen in a hotel of this size should do better when quiet . Spoke to the waiter and he offered us free coffee . Again he was very nice . We would definitely come back as it's great for family's with reasonable prices , a great pool and clean rooms . There is a shopping centre near by with restaurants so we would go there to eat next time .",4,2014,04,15
249,Good Hotel Nice food Great location.,"My family stayed last night and had dinner there. We had a nice, clean family room and enjoyed out dinner very much. Our waiter was outstanding (as were all the staff) and we had a peaceful sleep. It has a fantastic mall nearby and is fairly close to Dublin city centre.

Overall we were very impressed and though we don't use hotels a lot we will be booking it again soon.",4,2014,04,14
249,Brief overnight - great value,"Stayed here for an event our company was having. The evening meal was lovely, nothing spectacular but well prepared and tasty. We had arrived late so only made dinner with minutes to spare. Not sure if waitress/kitchen were too impressed with the late order but they took it and we enjoyed the food. Barely saw the room but it was clean and comfortable. Missed breakfast the next day so we all had lunch. I had the anti pasto plate and I have to say it was one of the best I've ever tried. All in all hotel was excellent value and without doubt we will be holding next years event there on the basis of this years service. ",4,2014,04,13
249,"Nice room,but alot to be said about the rest.","Stayed here before around two year ago perhaps less,seems to be new staff,on checking in i was quoted 45 euro more than what i had booked the price at,after some time it was settled at booking price which what it should have been.

Then i was asked to pay a deposit on the room,this is not mentioned on the website,after showing my confirmation email the check in guy said it should have stated this,but clearly after showing him the email it was not there and argued with me its a policy..If its policy it should be clearly stated on the home page on the website...

Checking out was a total nightmare,i was asked to wait for my deposit,yet they snap it out of your hand on checking in,i was dealing with an abrupt member of staff and i asked why do i have to wait,you didn't when taking it..
He just kept saying take a seat we need to do paperwork after ten minutes waiting i finally got my deposit back...

Breakfast is a whopping €12.50 other hotels in the locality charge less for the same.
Also i asked for two eggs as there was none on the tray,everyone else was in the same position,after a few minutes i got one tiny egg on a plate the size of a wheel,this is not on nor acceptable considered i clearly stated  two,i was told you can only have one egg...",3,2014,04,13
249,Still good value hotel,"Stayed previous occasions, glad to say still a good value comfortable hotel with a decent breakfast and decent rooms, would have no problem recommending hotel, only annoyance is having to pay 4 euros per night to park.",4,2014,04,09
249,Keep going back can't fault it !,"Stayed here again this last weekend and I can't fault this hotel, clean, reasonable price, quiet, very efficient service, good pool and fab bar food. We dined in bar both nights and coco our waitress was outstanding. Efficient, professional and friendly. She is a credit to the hotel. My daughter loves the pool and its a short stroll to Liffey Valley for the shops and cinema so as the driver I get a break and don't have to deal with city traffic. The hotel was full to capacity Friday night but there was no noise or agro which I have found to be common in a lot of hotels offering such reasonable prices. The bedroom was spotless, hot shower and plenty of water another bug bear of mine when lot of hotel have dribble showers. We were on second floor , rooms in 400 range and facing the motorway but the soundproof windows were brill. Curtains keep room dark so lie on was gained too. I always opt for this hotel now when need to go to Dublin as great taxi or bus services allow you to travel in area at great ease.",5,2014,04,07
249,No Room,"As a family of four 2 adults and 2 kids we arrived at this hotel today, only to advise we had no reservation. When we showed the itinery number the receptionist said it didn't match any number they would use so therefore it must have been booked through a fake web-site? it was booked through Alfa Rooms.  Receptionist less than helpful after being told we had travelled a distance with young kids she stated they had no availability and didn't even try to help us arrange another hotel for the night.  She offered no support or assistance what so ever. Extremely annoyed and kids very disappointed!",1,2014,04,05
249,"Short stop-over, good choice.","Booked this hotel specifically to rest after a log-haul flight before undertaking the drive home.  Early check-in and a quite day-time room were the special requests both of which were delivered on admirably. The Kudos bar/restaurant counter staff were very friendly and efficient at lunchtime. 

The evening room service was equally efficient and of good quality. The accommodation was as you would expect for a 4 star establishment and a little more.  Overall, great value and very welcoming.",4,2014,03,25
249,Clean and busy,"Stayed a number of times this year and last year 2013 /14
Rooms a good size and clean, Staff helpful, Price and food good.
Very good meal/ticket deal with local cinema 
down side
Main restaurant closed during the week food serviced in the bar area 

Frank",4,2014,03,16
249,Average Stay,"Average hotel at best, Breakfast was suppose to start at 6AM, food was not available until 6:30.  Breakfast could use some variety as it was the same every day, they have a pancake machine was that not turned on everyday.  I stayed for a week.  Smoke free policy was not enforced unless brought to managements attention, in my section of the hotel the you could smell the smoke in the hallway.  I believe the people in the room next to mine were smoking, management did address it after I brought it to there attention, however housekeeping must have know also.  Beds are firm but not uncomfortable.  Hotel shows its wear in the rooms, but is generally clean.

Restaurant is ok for a quick bite to eat but again, not much variety their are better options within a 15-20 min drive.",3,2014,03,14
249,Great hotel,"Stayed in the hotel as our freinds lived in ballyfermot. Bus is over the road for dublin N0 40 bus, not in a great location but the food is good and bar prices are reasonable , would recommend this hotel if you don't mind traveling for 30 mins to dublin",4,2014,03,11
249,"Delightful stay , when back in Dublin it will be my first option to stay .","I stayed for just the one night at the clarion . I was given a warm welcome from Ashley on the reception who checked me in . Also had food in the bar , was delicious .In the morning I had breakfast was fairly busy , I was greeted and brought to a table.Breakfast overall was just fine . Only negative side was being on ground floor , it had a strange smell , I spoke to Ashley about this issue she kindly said it would be no problem to move room . I was happy to stay were I was  , on my next visit I will choose a different floor.",5,2014,03,09
249,Valentines from hell,"We stayed here on 14th feb this year and i have to say it was the worst hotel experience of our lives. To begin with our room was located on the same floor as a college varsity team, it felt like we were in a frat party in college, not a romantic weekend away. They were up partying and running through the corridor all night, at one stage a drunk teenager tried to get into our room at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a towel. Needless to say I was not impressed. Several calls were made to reception and yet nothing was done to even accomodate us in a different room or any kind of remorse was shown by management. The evening meal got of to a good start but after the starter was served our drinks that we ordered still had not arrived nor had we been given our complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival. However we asked and were given the prosecco after 20mins. When the cocktails we ordered were brought one was spilled on my dress. The waitress left to get tissue and didnt return. I had to go up myself and ask for some napkins to dry the table not to mention my dress which was ruined. The staff didnt do anything to help they gave us the napkins and left us to dry the table. My partner was less than impressed. The mood for the night was ruined. They left us with slow service, sticky cutlery and a stained white dress. When we complained we were told to consult the duty manager the next morning which we did. She didnt offer any real compensation other than to dry clean the dress and a discounted room. We felt quite hard done by as the night itself cost 160€ and feel that a return to the hotel is more than likely not going to happen after this incident. No sleep, terrible service and made feel like a nuisance when the waitress wouldnt clean up our table. Definitely not worth the 160€ and i wouldnt particularly recommend this hotel after this shambles of a valentines weekend.",1,2014,03,09
249,excellent,"Stayed in Clarion Liffey Valley last night friday March 7, dinner in bar was excellent lovely waitress, we had got good news at hospital, our little waitress was nearly in tears, thanks for service as we needed to relax we will be back.",5,2014,03,08
249,Very big bed,"Needed a hotel for a night in Dublin to meet friends while on way to visit relatives, the clarion was at a good price, handy for the motorway and not to far away for our friend's home.  The room was modern staff were helpful, the hotel was clean, bed was comfortable and huge. Only grumble was we couldn't find a room thermostat, apart from that great place to stay on the outskirts of Dublin.",4,2014,03,08
249,Great hotel and reasonable price,"We have just stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It was our first visit to Dublin. We would definitely recommend a stay here, the hotel was very clean and modern and our room was a very good size. All of the staff were very friendly, and more than happy to help with any requests. We also had breakfast included which was buffet breakfast and very good. We didn't have a car but the local buses were easy enough to use to get to and from the city centre with a ten minute walk to the nearest stop.

On our last day we used the spa which was really relaxing to spend a bit of time in there using the jacuzzi, sauna and steam room before we checked out.

",4,2014,03,04
249,Enjoyable stay,"Hotel is fantastic, brilliant for a family. Facilities were excellent especially for the kids. Staff very friendly and could do no more for you. Extremely easy to find. Restaurants were outstanding and very handy for patrons of hotel. Highly recommended. ",5,2014,03,02
249,Rough and ready. Don't expect the Ritz and you won't be disappointed,"I spent 5 nights at the Clarion for a quiet gateway and was very pleased overall with the experience.

On night one there did seem to be a Christmas party. going on which spilled out into the rooms around me and I was woken up multiple times although could hear hotel staff dealing with this. corridor covered in broken glass the next morning - which was cleaned up by housekeeping when requested.

The other nights were no problem very comfortable room but disappointed by overall cleanliness and stained bed/furniture. Great spa and pool although not being local was annoyed at having to buy a swim cap for ""hygiene"". As others have noted there is a daily parking charge but if you go in open eyed then factor this into your costs.

The buffet breakfast was nothing special food wise but set you up for the day.

Staff were very friendly and accommodating and quick to remedy various small issues.

Location was convenient if you have a car but a bit laborious getting the bus into Dublin with a 10 minute walk to the nearest stop.

Overall I felt this hotel was good value for money if you search for a deal and would return. Need to know what to expect though.",4,2014,02,28
249,Enjoyable stay.,We stayed here half term weekend with our daughter & family. Rooms clean & nicely furnished with all facilities including fridge. Hotel very child friendly & easily accessed from M50. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Dinner in dining room was very good & reasonably priced. We were very satisfied overall.,4,2014,02,27
249,Lovely hotel with staff that can't do enough for you.,I spent a weekend here with my family. It's location is perfect. Close enough to a shopping centre and also to dublin city centre. The swimming pool was a hit with the girls. Definitely would stay here again. ,5,2014,02,27
249,family midterm break with some shopping thrown in,"We went to this hotel on Friday 21st for two nights during our 7 year olds midterm,fantastic staff very helpful ,great kids club going on ,real family feel as the children were catered for and happy 7 year old happy parents :)",5,2014,02,26
249,Perfect....,"Having stayed here several times with business, I now insist that I am booked to stay her on my visits.
Ideally suited to my needs, great location, quiet, comfortable, very pleasant staff, what more could you ask for.",5,2014,02,25
249,"Handy Location, good price, not four star standard.","The positives: Really good location if driving as near junction of M50 and M4, we were also planning visit to Zoo so easy to get there from hotel. Great wifi, staff pleasant and no problems with checking in/out.  Food in Kudos restaurant was good. Room clean.  Mini fridge in room, great for daughters bottles etc.  Negatives: asked for cot for our  daughter and was provided with one we presumed was just not fully assembled but turned out was broken on one side, surely who ever set it up knew this. Ended up putting daughter into bed only to discover, single bed in room has a joint in the middle which is really uncomfortable.  Balcony door lock not working so door held closed by some latches, probably just as well as room very warm so needed some fresh air getting in.  This hotel is ok but really not comparable with other four star hotels around the country, room prices probably reflect this.  If your travelling with child who needs cot try to bring a proper mattress, only the hard wooden backed one provided but in fairness have found this to be the case in other hotels also.",3,2014,02,23
249,Oh to be a student again,"I spent a few days at this Hotel and was very surprised to be completely honest. I went on a 3 day break with my husband and daughter for valentines day. Lucky for us the Hotel was full uwith young students, I found this very appealing as I love people watching! I found the students to be very polite and friendly. However, I witnessed staff being very rude to them on many occassions. The weekend was fun packed for these students with a fancy dress element and a ""Mad"" T Party on the final night. I'm an Alice in Wonderland fan, and my daughter is even more so, so I enjoyed the atmosphere of this type of formal affair. We enjoyed spotting the style and I must say they looked very impressive. But much to my dismay this party was very much crashed by a bauld headed weasel of a man who would not allow the colleges to perform their traditional college anthem which they had been practising for months. The anthem leader was so nervous he forgot the order of the actions. God love the poor fellow. He was a trooper, he tried to continue but this same staff weasel shot him down and would not allow it. God loves a trier. The hotel manager and staff were completely unprofessional and even managed to reduce a very pretty lady kitted out in a trendy 1920s ensemble to tears. I was anything but impressed. For me, the weekend was brilliant. This was not due to the hotel staff but the energetic and lively students that surrounded us and included us in every aspect of their weekend. Psychadelic everything abounded throughout until the students departed on monday morning leaving me feeling empty and lonely inside. I wish I was a student again. So to all you students out there think twice before booking into this hotel.",2,2014,02,19
249,Great Hotel - Not too bad to get to Dublin from,"I stayed in this Hotel over the Wales and Ireland international weekend.  The Hotel is very clean, very quiet and in a great place (situated 400m from the Liffey Valley Shopping centre). The facilities are very good, free Wi-Fi everywhere, Pool and sauna very good and the food in the Bar was good. 
The fact that it’s close to the shopping centre gives you options for food with usual chains and there is a good pub/restaurant (the Arc) just 100ms away. 
Getting to Dublin is easy - walk to the shops and catch the 40 bus 3 Euro each way - takes 40 mins or taxi 22 Euros 
Breakfast was very good plenty of choices and good quality",4,2014,02,14
249,"Fantastic Hotel, Staff Even Better!!","I decided to take my sister and my niece and nephew away for a night in January as a treat.  The hotel is fantastic for children and Victoria on reception was brilliant, the interaction she made with my niece and nephew was great and they still talk about 'the lovely lady' at reception.

We had a great night stay and we didnt want to leave the next day.  It is the best hotel i have stayed in for families.

Well done :)",5,2014,02,13
249,Really happy with my stay at this hotel,I just spent a few nights at the Clarion Liffey Valley and I was really pleased with it.  First of all a big thank to all the staff but in particular Victoria who made my stay so much more pleasant by her friendly and helpful manner. I also loved the location of my room on the first floor close to the conferencing centre which was very convenient for me plus it was really quiet even though the hotel was very busy. The breakfast was lovely and in a nice bright setting. Being so close to the Liffey Valley shopping centre was a nice bonus.  I would recommend this hotel.,4,2014,02,06
249,"Great hotel, will be back","I recently satyed in this hotel for a bit of a midweek break with my partner. We got the hotel at a great price but after reading the reviews i was a little worried. I have to stay some people will complain about anything. we parked in the underground car park although a cost was involved the car was secure. on entering reception we were checked in within a few minutes. No Wait. 
we were on the lower ground floor which again i was worried about until i got into the room. The rooms are a good size, comfortable and had a few greats night sleep. shower over a bath which was just ok, was hard to get the temp right but no complaints about the bathroom in general. The tv had a good selection of channels but we just used the free wi-fi and watch what we wanted on our tablets. The room had a safe which was easy to work. Alos had a fridge whcih was very cold and great for putting a bottle of wine into.we had food one night in the hotel which was lovely, ther service was a bit slow but they were busy. we never used the leisure facilites so i can not comment on them but they seem to have people coming and going all the time. 

This is a busy hotel, alot of business people staying mid week any way.

There is a shopping centre located within walking distance of the hotel that has verious places to eat. Would recoommed eddie rocktes. and a very large number of shops. It is also has a large cinema which was great for something to do. 

We never ventured into Dublin so not sure about the travel into the city centre. 

I have to say i was very please with my stay here and I will be returning.",4,2014,01,31
249,Excellent two bedroom appartment,"There were 4 adults and 3 children staying in this large appt. Two king size rooms, one ensuite and a bed in living room for Two boys. Cot provided for toddler. Loads of space.

249,good value -get the check in staff off the phones!,"i stay here quite often,its good value,the rooms are clean and a good size.the breakfast room is very good but the quality of breakfast is poor,the usual large chain offering -totally bland-just have tea/coffee and toast.the staff vary,the most annoying thing is that the check in staff also answer the telephone as well,so when they are dealing with you they are often interrupted by the telephone -it really is rude and something i have never seen before,they need to invest in a call centre to handle bookings by phone! also make sure your room is near the entrance or you will have a long walk.the pool is a nice bonus.",3,2014,01,16
249,horrendously bad,"Room wasn't serviced, we had to wait 45 mins for extra duvet as we were only given a single duvet for 2 people! Slats on the bed were broke, we had a room beside the lift and fire doors that we had to listen to all night with people coming and going. We booked a suite for a family trip for my husbands birthday and were bitterly disappointed. No tea and coffee supplied in the suite and the 2nd bed was a pullout sofa. They ran out of plates at breakfast, had to wait 20 mind for a cup of coffee and ended up getting it ourselves, cleanliness of dining room terrible as was the service and attitudes of staff.",1,2014,01,16
249,4 star it is not!,"I stayed here for 1 night & I have to say it wasn't great, firstly it took about 30 mins to check in by the slowest person EVER!! I was very tired & in the time it took the receptionist to check us in, 3/4 other people were checked in by someone else! Then you have the LONG walk to get to your room once you're out of the lift, the room looked lovely, but the bathroom was a TOTAL let down, the bath mat was full of blue mold & the tile grout was absolutely filthy,",3,2014,01,10
249,Weekend away,noisey hotel not suitable for famlies in my opinion. Food in bar was expensive and nothing to suit kids. Rooms were basic thought it would be better. reception was very busy and had to wait a long time to get attention.,3,2014,01,08
249,Lidl Stay few couples with small kids,"We and few couples with kids booked b&b and dinner in clarion. the first disappointment was at the reception, when we was told about cash deposit of 50 Euro on the check in. they did not accepted credit card for deposit only cash and the nearest bank link was in liffey valey shopping centre:(. and it is 4 star hotel..
 We booked few rooms on the same voucher but was giving rooms far from each other:(. 
 Dinner was delicious but desserts for my kids was disappointment- chocolate cake just 1 cm thick with rotten fresh berries- i mentioned this to the waiter, she looked at and told just sorry- we paid for this dessert around 4 Euro by the way :(. Some cakes was decorated with cream some with chocolate- was a bit hard to explain to the small kids why they getting the same but different cakes.. They forgot to bring the vegetables for everyone that we ordered, and because all the staff was quite busy was hard to get anyone attention, so we ended to share 2 portions of vegetables with 9 adults at the table.:( But enjoyed the breakfast.
 Lovely staff at the swim pool- this is for sure. The rest of the personal at the reception and the restaurant was too busy to care about ""lidl bookings""- just the way they called us:)
 The room just very traditional Clarion room quite spacious- but 2 bulbs was missing in our bathroom. And when my kid dropped his toy and i was picking this from the floor- noticed that underneath the bed was so much rubbish left from previous customers.:( otherwise was quite clean;)
 The reception- on the check out we was needed to get our deposit back and after waiting for 20 mins in the queue, the receptionist told us to take a seat.. and forgot about us, and we was waiting another 20 minutes. aa we noticed that all other guests was getting their deposits straight away. So, i came to ask him why it is so and why such discrimination. Yes we a foreign but why it is such a big problem?! After this we was sorted in no time:)
 Just want to say a huge Thank You to the reservation team especially to Jennifer- she is the best and helped us a lot with the booking and organising the restaurant tables and so. Very helpful and pleasant person!!
 One more thing- if you would go with the kids- be prepared that other kids would be running and playing and knocking your room door at the floor hall until 1 or 2 am, and would not be stopped by security guards. And if u would like to have a rest with your lil one- it is absolutely unreal.
 We stayed at another Clarions before and really enjoyed, but was very disappointed with this one.",2,2014,01,05
249,New years eve,"Well my partner and I took our son down (2years) it was our first time taken him, we had the worst nights sleep ever! Yes I understand it was NYE but rooms beside us, facing us and up the corridor were banging on each other doors, slamming doors, knocking doors and running away , banging our door. My son was up numerous times due to this behaviour we had to sit up with him near all night and bring him into our bed for comfort and he said it was noisey and he was scared! They sounded like young teenagers as there was a man banging doors on our floor lookong for his son! 

Overall breakfast was lovely , recommend going down about 10:00 as when we were finished and leaving there was quite a que. Staff were friendly, helpful and polite. Room was clean and tidy , our only problem was that we had a balcony, but the balcony door handle didnt lock, it was broke.. so we had to use the child safe lock instead which is not very safe. Rooms are also quite dull hotel provides 3 lamps but very red/pinkish bulbs they dom't give off much light.

Playroom was handy for our son. He was only in it once but he enjoyed it. We tried taken him swimming, told my partner and I we werent allowed to swim as we had no swimming caps??? However they did let us take our son into the baby pool, but not actually get in to it.

It is a bit out of the way, 20mins on the bus or taxi for 15-20€. 

The hotel had something on for NYE but was obvious quite late so we didn't attend.

I may go back again, but not getting any sleep untill 6am has slightly put me off however it isn't the hotels fault the guests they encounter.",4,2014,01,01
249,Dec 28-1st Jan,"Stayed here for 4 nights for a New Years break...
Reception was always busy, there was always a line of at least 4 people which was quite slow.
Although staff were very friendly and hotel always clean.
Used the steam room and jacuzzi once. Steam room out of action and had been for two weeks. Although couldn't use the pool as we didn't have a swimming cap!
Room was quite cold with no controls to turn heat up. Old school TV.
Not the quietest rooms, heard next doors tv down to voices on the tv. A lot of banging and people walking down the corridor,
Bed quite firm which gave me backache, but that's personal choice.
Quote far out from the city (and we don't usually mind being out of it) 10 min walk and 20 min bus ride away, although quite frequent and €2.60 fare each into Dublin isn't too bad.
Didn't eat here, we ate at the Arc bar, which was lovely €10 for breakfast with a massive pot of tea! 
Good nightlife there too.",3,2013,12,31
249,nice spot for long stay,"i was stay in that hotel with my work mates for 3 weeks time . did book it with ryanair web site .. it was handy location for as becouse it was clouse to motorway by that motorway was handy to get back to work to HP. once did mistake and book room with one double and one single bad in it , we did not want to sleep in the same bad i went to reception did tell to manager what is the story is and manager change the room to room with 3 single bads in the room without any extra charge!!!",5,2013,12,30
249,Rugby/Family Trip,"My family and I stayed here in early November 2013.  The hotel is a great base to explore Dublin.  Although it is a little bit out, a 5 minute walk to the bus station takes you straight into town.  The hotel itself is basic but the food and the bar area where great.  Breakfast was also good and plenty on offer.  I would stay in this hotel is going to a rugby match again or a concert in Dublin.  Very child friendly.",5,2013,12,12
249,Great for families,"Have stayed here a couple of times. Apartments are available with 2 rooms at a slightly higher price but well worth it, if travelling with children. Rooms in both apartments and hotel are quite warm however and air
Conditioning system doesn't always work. If hotel is busy get down in time for breakfast to avoid having to queue! ",4,2013,12,09
249,The hotel itself is disappointing but nice reception staff!,"After a long flight, we were starving so we went to Kudos, the bar restaurant of the hotel. 
We ordered lamb. Lamb has a very distinct and special taste; at Kudos, it did have any taste at all.

Note: there is an excellent Asian restaurant next to the hotel: ""Lemon Grass"".
 
The rooms are just ok and to get the rooms you need to walk a loooong way. 

The breakfast is the real disappointment. The omelette is not good, all the rest is very industrial and the staff does not pay attention to you  when you arrived because they are trying to fix the pancake machine for 2 days. 

The gym is open only until 19:30, it just looked promising :(

The Wi-Fi is really good and free!

Josh, the reception guy, is great and very helpful.",3,2013,12,09
249,A not bad at all stay .......,"Having read quite a few mixed reviews on this hotel before booking, I was pleasantly surprised by my Friday overnight stay. I booked through travel republic. When i logged on the twin room was available for £59 but it disappeared and then it went to £66 then it disappeared and eventually I got it booked for £74 twin room bed and breakfast. The hotel is located adjacent to the m50.
We arrived at abt 930 pm drove straight into the 4 euro secure underground car park. A lot of people on reviews complain about the charge. What is 4 euro for peace of mind for your car for the night? Having said that we had great difficulty getting the barrier to let us out and had to make several mercy dashes to reception when the machine kept spitting the ticket out. 
Check in was rather slow with only one member of staff on reception. The people in front of me took longer than I'd have wanted to get checked in though mine was done and dusted in two mins. The hotel appeared very busy. It was nicely presented. There was a huge Christmas tree in the foyer. 
By the time we checked in it was nearly 10pm so we went straight to the busy bar where there was a choice of bar food or Asian. There was not a huge choice but again it was adequate. The main restaurant was no longer serving. We both (female friend and myself) chose club sandwich and chunky chips. It wasn't fabulous but for under 10 euro it was not bad. Waiting staff were pleasant and service was unbelievably fast. We then went up to the room on the third floor. There were three beds in our twin bedded room. One queen and two singles. I got the queen. My friend had the single! The room was double glazed but I have to be honest and say it was noisy. When u looked out the window the busy motorway is nearby. Having said that it was not a problem. Yes I could hear it but it didn't prevent me doing anything! The room was smart and nicely presented. The form to order breakfast in the room was missing. There was no do not disturb sign for the door. The bathroom was compact and clean and there was not a separate shower but there was a good shower curtain and a great shower in the bath with powerful hot water. There was ample soap shampoo etc and towels. There was extra bedding pillows etc.,there was tea and coffee etc but a wee biscuit would have been nice. 
Now to the best bit. The bed. I think I am well travelled. I can honestly say I don't remember ever sleeping in a bed so comfy. It wouldn't have mattered if the motorway was coming thru the bedroom so comfortable were the pillows, mattress and bedding. Apparently I snored all night. Bliss. 
Breakfast was good. As other people have said the hot option was only warm but if U serve food onto cold plates and don't cover the food that's how it's going to be!   There was ample nice juice cold selection croissants Danish cereals toast etc. Not a vast selection but again more than adequate. It was very busy with almost every table taken. Staff were unobtrusive and pleasant. For hungry travellers breakfast was a good experience.
There was no queue to check out so it was just a matter of handing keys in. Apart from the debacle of getting car park barrier to open we were on our way and back on the m50 in two mins. 
All in all for the money, a great budget stopover hotel. ",3,2013,12,01
249,Great for a get-together!,"Stayed on a Saturday night. We booked two rooms and asked for adjoining rooms, which we got. Rooms were nice and clean, plenty of extra pillows and towels in the room. Dinner was included and the food was really lovely. The staff were very helpful, especially Neil on reception. There was a good selection of food available at the breakfast buffet, and staff were very quick to help with any requests. When we were leaving the dining room at 10:30am there was a queue for breakfast, but there were posters up in the lifts and corridors advising of this and indicating which times were the busiest. We will definitely be back.",5,2013,11,25
249,won't be back,"Although we got a good rate i won't stay here again,as soon as i sat on the bed i got a damp,musty smell off it.There was tea/coffee,sugar and milk sachets in the room but no kettle! In the bar there were dinner specials advertised on the board,but none of these were still available when we tried to order,it was asian cuisine or sandwiches after 6 o clock apparently.Not the hotels fault but there was a gang of 8-12 years olds running wild around the bar,In the morning the queue for breakfast was ridiculous....and just to top it all off i had to pay for parking my car in the hotel car-park...that is a first for me.In the hotels favour i will say that it is well priced and well located for travelling to/from the airport or shopping and it was quiet during the night.",2,2013,11,24
249,2 sleepless nights,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights while visiting Dublin.  The good thing about this hotels is that it is cheaper than most hotels just outside Dublin and is easy to get into the city from the hotel via a local bus.  However, when we were checked into the hotel, our room was in the basement.  This floor shares offices with the hotel.  Although the entire hotel is non smoking, both nights we had smoke filling our room from nearby smokers in the hotel.  I rang to complain both nights and a member of staff was sent down to investigate!  Unfortunately for us they could not find out who was smoking.  Best not to get a room in the basement!",2,2013,11,23
249,Great rates and brilliant staff,Cheap prices for top of the range rooms. Even though its just off the motorway its nice and quiet. Staff are extremely welcoming and friendly and helpful. Only a stone throws to liffey valley with a nice separate way to walk. Breakfast was amazing. I am full up till dinner!,5,2013,11,22
249,charges,the hotel itself was very good for my 2 night stay as i was there to watch the rugby food good service very good entertainment none at all .the lack of entertainment was bad enough but to be charged 4 euro a day to park in the hotel car park was outrageous. when i go to a hotel i expect to be able to park free of charge .,4,2013,11,20
249,Great location,Stayed at hotel last weekend great location for city and a shopping trip.The staff were very pleasant. You need to be down early for breakfast around nine to avoid queues there was a long queue as we were leaving restaurant around 10.00. Very good value for money.,4,2013,11,19
249,Slow service and poor food in a noisy hotel,"I have stayed here several times for business meetings but this will be the last time.
Reception area is always noisy and reception is slow for checking in or out.
Bedrooms are ok but nothing special and it can be noisy in corridor at night or outside.
Room service pizza was very poor. Breakfast was disappointing - with hot food lukewarm and the only fruit available was tinned grapefruit and 2 apples. I had to wait nearly 15 minutes for coffee.
Lunch again was slow but was the best meal.
The hotel location is handy but hotel is poor to average.",3,2013,11,19
249,Providal of simple request,"Ludicrously rude front staff. my recent stay ended with shocking events with the supervisor.  I was staying there as I was sick at the time, with two young children i thought I could go to the Clarion to recuperate. I called Reception at least three times to ask for a phone charger, I needed to may sure my kids had gotten to school and  my toddler was okay.  I was refused a landline call first of all.

I had paid them cash for my roomand as I didnt have a credit card they refused to allow me to call 'outside', or even charge it to my partners card which I could have gotten.

I went down the lobby, stil v sick, and asked where was the charger I had been promised ,?  :Answer now?  'we dont give them to residents;

Infuriated I let them have piece of mind, the Supervisor turns up, speaks to me in a threatening tone, and manhandled me to the lift....An utter disgrace and I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

In this day and age a small thing such as asking for a phone charger becomes such a huge issue.  The Gardai were involved, at her behest, but I shall be taking this matter further to the MD, and am considering a Civil Suit against the 'hotel'.. if you could call it that.",1,2013,11,17
249,"Great Value, Great Service and Great Location","The Clarion has become our place of residance in Dublin, it's SOoooo handy located on the Western side of town just off the Motorways and beside the Liffey Valley Centre ( if you wanted to do a little retailing ). The Staff are  friendly, chearful and very helpful. Great Food and rooms, so waht more can you ask for ? Oh Yeah, Value of money, You have it at the Clarion. OK so I'm biased, as part of the Sligo Rovers traveling army we stay here every time we win the FAI Cup.",5,2013,11,12
249,Comfortable Stay,"Stayed here (2 adults & 2 small kids) for the weekend as we were in Dublin for Disney on Ice. Booked through 'TodayFM' breaks, 2 nights B+B with one evening meal. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay.The hotel was very busy with many families up for the same show as us which ran from Thursday to Sunday.
The family rooms are clean, cosy if a little on the small side. The beds are very comfortable and we had zero noise problems. The kids loved the swimming pool although it was quite busy but that was to be expected. 
Very disappointed with the breakfast on the first morning - the hot buffet was cold... The choice is great though and the second morning everything was spot on. We were lucky that we went for breakfast before 9am as there was a long queue as we were leaving the dining room which would have been a nightmare!
The meal in the restaurant was really nice and the staff are very nice and pleasant. Having to pay 4 euro a day for parking is a bit  saucy but we were aware of that when we booked so can't complain too much.
Overall, this hotel is very good and we would definitely stay again. PS Free wifi with excellent coverage",4,2013,11,10
249,Mixed feelings,"Recently stayed at the Clarion for the FAI Cup Final, (which was amazing btw).  Our flight was very early and we knew we wouldn't be able to check in early although the hotel did let us leave our bags in a cupboard and were made welcome to stay in reception on the comfy furniture.  The staff were polite and helpful but I must add that Neil I think his name was did look a little stressed at times and didn't smile very often but it was very busy.  We stayed B&B, the room was lovely and clean. Get in the early breakfast session and you won't have a problem getting a seat. Another review said the breakfast was hot etc, I actually found it cold on both mornings.  Plenty of choice though.  Bus stop into Dublin is a very long walk!  Airport bus stops right outside the door which is a bonus.  Very clean and nice looking hotel. Probably next time would stay in a hotel closer to Dublin but our experience here was a pleasant one.",3,2013,11,08
249,Up for the Cup!,"We have stayed here several times over the past few years, most recently for the weekend of the FAI Cup Final. The hotel is fast becoming a home from home for Sligo people! Despite half the population of the North West descending on the hotel all at once the staff keep providing a courteous and efficient service. 
Check-in was quick enough, considering the numbers of guests involved. The family rooms are a good size, warm, clean & comfortable. 
We ate in the bar, which was a little short staffed at peak times, the food from the Asian style menu was really tasty.
The older kids had use of a ""Teen Room"", which apparently was the business! 
Breakfast was hot, fresh and plentiful. 
We will definitely be back, hopefully for the Cup Final again next year :-)",4,2013,11,06
249,Greedy Hotel $$$$$,"STAY AWAY AT ALL COST!!!!!!!
Had a 2 night stay B&B with 1 dinner inclusive. On our first night we were woken at 5am to the sound of boy racers in the private car park, as we were on the ground floor, one car was parked outside the window playing really loud music from the boot of his car, I rang down to reception but this continued all night. The breakfast was fine if you can get a seat. That evening we decided to go for a room service option for breakfast on the second morning (which is offered in the hotels in room guide) only to be told by the receptionist ""they no longer provide this service as they couldn't provide a quality service and people were receiving cold breakfasts, so they just stopped"". In my opinion this is not a suitable justification for your customers. Upon going down to breakfast at 9am the 2nd morning there was a queue which extended from the breakfast room to the front door of the hotel. We made the decision to go next door for breakfast to the arc. This hotel clearly cannot deal with the capacity of people it holds in the hotel. We tried on several occasions to go for a swim and the pool was at max capacity at all times with children, there is no cut off time for children in the pool. The most frightening thing about this hotel apart from the fact that your viewed as a wallet from the moment you walk in the door has to be the car park. Cars are regularly double parked all over the car park, by day and night, in front of FIRE HYDRANTS!! I really don't think the welfare of this hotels customers are a priority at all. Upon check out I explained all the things which had left our stay less than enjoyable to reception and was met with a ""sorry and that's the direction in which you can pay for your parking"". I've stayed in better hostels than this and am shocked it's a four star hotel, if there were negative stars that's what I would award our stay in this greedy hotel.",1,2013,11,06
249,Nice hotel  shame about the parking fee.,"Stayed here for one night for a family event nearby.  Lovely room, clean hotel. Breakfast was bedlam as the FAI Cup final was on - coupled with the end of mid term.

Would recommend it though. The only downer was the €4 charge for the car parking. Seriously? It isn't Dublin City Centre.",4,2013,11,06
249,Family stay for Mam's Birthday,"Fourteen of the family recently stayed at the Clarion overnight for Mam's Birthday.The location is fantastic-a home away from home and both quiet and relaxing. The close proximity of Liffey Valley shopping centre is a welcome bonous and attraction before heading for the sauna room and pool for a quick refresh. The food was excellent and the staff courtious and friendly.The breakfast is fit for a king and the value for money excellent. Well done to all at the Clarion.
John&Maureen",4,2013,11,05
249,Just first class ,Well what can i say. Clarion hotel upgraded us to the penthouse apartment when we arrived. I have to say it is just the best thing ever. From the food to the staff everything was just first class. Thank you all again for a great stay and we are looking forward to a return visit very soon. ,5,2013,11,03
249,Family weekend break,"We booked through lidl for 2 nights b&b with dinner. Hotel is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is nice. A movie night for kids during midterm break, a nice touch. The rooms were average and family rooms quite small. We didn't leave credit card details at reception on check-in and were asked to pay up front. We couldn't charge anything to our room and pay on check out which we would normally do. One night when I was putting the baby to bed restaurant staff phoned the room looking for payment of kids meals & drinks, so I had to telephone my husband to go go back to restaurant to pay. This annoyed me really and I've never experienced this in any other hotel. Hotel is in a good location for shopping. Rooms were very warm also. Too hot. We enjoyed it overall. The friendliness of staff really stands to this hotel.",3,2013,11,01
249,Comfortable Hotel but poorly managed and too far away from City,"A group of 12 of us stayed at this hotel in early October booked through Delta Vacations.  The hotel was comfortable, the beds were good and the food was good in both restaurants however, the hotel is poorly managed and unresponsive to the needs of it's customers.  Parking was very confusing.  When Delta made the reservations at Liffey Valley, I went to their website and noticed that the hotel was pretty far away from the City Centre.  In order to plan for our trip, I emailed the email site given at the hotel web page.  I asked what the transportation options were for the hotel by bus, train, metro or whatever else might be available.  I did not receive a reply from the hotel so I emailed them again.  Still no reply.  I emailed them 4 more times but never heard from them.  I finally called the hotel and spoke with Amanda O'Reilly.  She gave me her email address and assured me she would respond to me.  She never responded either so we rented cars not knowing our options.  When we arrived at the Clarion, I asked for a manager and was sent to a man named Roman.  I explained the situation and he assured me he would look into the problem and get back to me.  He never did and we were there 5 nights.  This is very poor management for answering a simple request.",2,2013,10,24
249,Nice place,"Stayed here overnight,lovely clean hotel,near shops,nice hotel bar and great food,all you need in one place really!staff were friendly and polite,loads of taxis waiting right at the door if you wanted to go anywhere and they asking gad an airport bus service.",4,2013,10,23
249,short stay,Hotel room was very good but I would recommend a room which is not facing the m50 motorway as  it is very noisy at night. I did not have breakfast in the hotel but the bar across the road served a very good breakfast with friendly staff. Hotel very near Liffey Valley shopping centre. From the airport to the Hotel I took the Airport Hopper which took me to the door. Very good.,4,2013,10,22
249,Hotel was a good weekend away,"Me & my girlfriend booked this hotel mainly due to the price for a weekend break away. Firstly it is around 10 miles from the hotel, by taxi €25 roughly, or €35-40 in traffic, I thought it was a bit closer to dublin. There is a shopping centre over the road which is ok, all your normal shops & a cinema. The hotel room was nice and everything I expected, clean and tidy. Most staff were helpful, apart from one lady on reception who couldn't tell me where the local bus stop was clearly. The hotel I found was very noisy at night, and the double bed fealt like it was two beds put together...annoying especially when one bed fealt hard and the other soft. Guiness factory in dublin is well worth a visit & guided bus your was also very good @ €18 per adult and lasts for 2 days, you hop on and off as many times as you like. temple bar is a fantastic area and lots of atmosphere to be had. dublin did not disappoint, a lovely city. ",4,2013,10,22
249,next to m50,Great position next to M50 and an easy walk from the shops. Staff were good. We had an executive room which was very nice and worth the money. The leisure centre is good too with pool steam room and sauna. Im sad to say that the quality in the breakfast items was simply not there.  But overall we we enjoyed our stay and will stay again.,4,2013,10,20
249,"Good quality, great value","Stayed at this hotel about 8 years ago, when it was almost brand new, but haven't been back as other hotels were closer to where I needed to be. I needed somewhere to stay for a night this week and it was cheaper to hire a car and drive from South Dublin to here than it was to stay at any other hotel (with decent leisure facilities) near Sandyford and go by Aircoach.
The hotel hasn't really been upgraded since it was built, so the rooms and corridors look very slightly dated (e.g. CRT TV as opposed to flat screen, slightly worn carpets), but everything is spotlessly clean and still works. There was a choice between wired and wireless Internet, both free. The room was large, with all the facilities you would expect. The food was excellent, but slightly on the pricy side. One of the highlights was the leisure suite. I try to use leisure facilities when I'm travelling and this was the best hotel gym I've been to. Most are box-ticking exercises, but this was a full leisure club, with a huge cardio area (with multimedia screens etc on all the machines), abs section, well-equipped free weights room and a large pool, sauna and steam room.
Breakfast buffet was well-stocked, with a choice of the usual full Irish, continental, fruit salad, etc. The staff were very polite and helpful and willing to accommodate special requests, such as poached eggs, to accompany the buffet.
Overall, for 79 euro including breakfast, this is the best value hotel I've found in Dublin, but its location does mean you will need a car or be prepared to listen to the moans of a Dublin taxi driver.",5,2013,10,18
249,Excellent hotel and service,"Second time to stay here and it is one of my favorite hotels. Location is great as it is situated right beside liffy valley shopping center. We ate in the bar on both stays and the food was excellent!! 
They have a chinese style menu which also gives you a calorie idea of whats in the food. The staff in the bar are really nice and they have great friendly personalites which makes you feel very welcome. Rooms are really nice and beds were very comfy on both stays. Would recommend this hotel and I look forward to coming back for a 3rd stay!",4,2013,10,14
249,Don't have high expectations,"I stayed 2 nights expecting the rooms to be delightful as described by the hotel and we were paying for a 4* hotel. However the experience from both rooms booked was similar to that of other negative reviews. When we spoke to the Duty Manager about the stains on cushions, gone off milk, peeling off paint and dirty shower floor, he said that this was to be expected of a hotel this size. He did offer to give us free breakfast until I explained we had already paid for it, to which he retracted the offer. His tone and customer service was so appalling I had to leave the conversation, after all what more could be said, if that is what he thinks the hotel should be like. If you wish to use the facilities such as gym etc the opening times are not always as generous as the website states. Don't order breakfast.",2,2013,10,14
249,Soulless,"Stayed here for one night only thankfully.

Lobby looks ok but the bar area was bare & soulless, reminded me of a drinking hall in soviet Russia, no warmth or atmosphere at all.

Room was fairly standard, however the sheets were disgusting, the fitted sheet on the bed had a flannel section to it, it was like an absorbent Sher you would put under main sheet on a childs bed if they wet the bed a lot.

They provided only one towel for the two of us, no hand towel or even face cloth.

Was kept awake all night by couple rowing & singing bad Whitney Houston till very early hours, 5.40am at last check.  The door dividing our room was paper thin, as were the walls.

I stayed here because I had to, not by choice & will not be staying again. 

",3,2013,10,13
249,Best Feature - Excellent Staff,"We had a family gathering and decided to stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley because of it's location and accessibility.  We stayed for the weekend and the ages ranged from 11 - 80 and everyone had a great stay.  The staff on reception were incredibly helpful especially Linda who went out of her way to help with mobility issues of a family member - it really made a good impression on the family.  The restaurant staff were also excellent and coped well with a large group meal for 18 on the Saturday night.  The menu had changed that day and the choices offered were good - the pork main course on the TDH menu was particularly delicious!

The rooms were all adequate, nothing luxurious  but were good value for money. I found the rooms too warm and if you opened the windows the sounds of the motorway could be heard - luckily a fan was provided. 

Breakfast had a good choice and while scrambled eggs were available other eggs could be cooked to order which was excellent.  The staff were under pressure to clear tables because of queues forming outside the restaurant but no-one was left waiting for too long.  

I've stayed before and enjoyed it but because we had elderly members of the group this time, I noticed how conscientious the staff were.  Well done everyone - you're a great team.",5,2013,10,10
249,weekend break,"Stayed in the Clarion for 2 nights.Great value,clean and comfortable rooms,staff friendly and helpful.excellent breakfast.Good location with ample parking.  All the family enjoyed our stay, Would defiantly stay again.",4,2013,10,08
249,Quailty at the right price! Good service too.,"Have stayed here twice on business and really enjoyed it. Would love to visit with family for pleasure sometime. 
I have stayed in Clarion Limerick too. Theyre a great hotel group with top quality and service as standard. I wouldnt hesitate to stay again.",4,2013,10,05
249,Lunch,"Looking for somewhere for a quick business lunch,would recommend  the Clarion at Liffey valley  this Close to N4 / M50, very attentive staff , perfectly acceptable food , and good value. No charge for parking!",4,2013,10,05
249,Great value hotel with a very friendly team,"This has to be one of the best value hotels close to Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and the walk in shower very pleasant indeed.  The breakfast was excellent with so much choice, really enjoyed the Irish black and white pudding.  I didn't eat dinner in the hotel but there are plenty of good places to eat close by which also is a benefit at this location.",5,2013,10,03
249,Very Disappointing,"Just home from staying 2 nights at this hotel, hardly got any sleep at all. After booking a package deal for 2 adults and 2 children, I emailed beforehand to ask for a quiet room but was given a very small famliy room where you couldn't swing a cat and where you could hear the traffic on motorway (and had an adjoining room where you could everything in room next to us). Thankfully there was a fan in the room as it got very stuffy at nighttime.  I was unable to put the kids in the shower as it was extremely dangerous as it was either boiling hot or freezing.  There was a leak in the bathroom, which left the floor constantly wet. 

I had also informed the hotel in advance via email that it was my daugther's 11th birthday during our stay and would appreciate it, if they marked it in some way (no matter how small) - same was overlooked and indeed I have never had the courtesy of a reply to my email.

I was surprised to see a hotel of this standard having very old tv's, as most hotels these days would have tv's with flat screens. TV was very small. 

Breakfast was very bland and lacked choice, espeically for myself who is a vegetarian, dont even have mushrooms! If you want fried eggs, you have to ask waitress as only scrambled eggs on display.  I believe you have to pay a supplement if you want an omelete.

Leisure centre was very nice and enjoyed this facility and kids can stay in until 7pm. 

I had to pay in total an extra 8 euro for parking which is a disgrace after paying so much to stay.  Hotel itself seemed to have my booking all mixed up, wherein they asked what time I wanted dinner, and when I queried this I realised they put me in for a different package and intended charging me more, thankfully I had the reservation details with me.

I will not be staying in this hotel again.",2,2013,10,01
249,great hotel,"great location tight next to the liffey,  took 10 min from Dublin port
we were there for our anniversary, the room, staff and room were all excellent,  the hotel spa was a nice and relaxing the staff were also great,  didn't eat there so cannot comment on food.
the hotel staff did everything to make it a great stay, we will be staying there the next time were in Dublin
thank you",5,2013,10,01
249,Not the Nicest Place...,"Myself & my mother stayed here the weekend of the All Ireland football final. We booked a double room as that was all that was left at the time of booking, as expected the hotel was busy but check-in was fast & efficient. We were put into an apartment on the ground floor which is actually located outside of the hotel. To be honest we would of preferred to have stayed in the hotel as we felt abit isolated over in the apartment and less secure (esp. because we were two women & on the ground floor). When we arrived at the apartments there was actually a smell of urine - not great but it got worse... our room had a lovely view of the busy main road, there were stains on the couch, the base of the bed was ripped and the room was not cleaned very well. It seemed that the room was in dire need of maintenance and was probably used for groups such as hen and stag do's. 

We Called the hotel and explained that we would like to be moved back into the hotel as we were not happy with where were and they said they would call us back which they did but it was to move us into another apartment off the road side I explained again that we did not want to be in the apartments and they agreed to move us back into the hotel.

When we got to the reception I must say Linda was very good and upgraded us to a penthouse although she did mention that they had upgraded us to an apartment -Certainly not an upgrade in my opinion!  Either way lovely girl very nice and helpful.

When we got to our room it was lovely and quiet- a bit of damage to the bath but still was nicer than the first room. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom. -we were missing our hairdryer but that was easily sorted with a call down to reception and the TV wasn’t working but we got that sorted easily enough as well.

We had a few drinks in the bar and to be honest service was slow and not the friendliest & I wouldn’t rate the presentation of the cocktails either!

The next morning we expected it to be busy for breakfast which it was - so busy in fact I think they were struggling to keep on top of things. Tables were not set and we had to ask for a few things such as tea and Cutlery but they came quickly once we had asked. The ""hot"" buffet was cold and it wasn’t the nicest I’ve had & to be honest there wasn’t a great selection, the Yoghurt was flavourless and sour and the fruit salad looked like it came from a tin- €10 I would expect the quality and selection to be better.  

Overall it wasn’t the nicest place of stayed, the standard of housekeeping and maintenance needs to be addressed and the bar staff could probably do with taking a lesson or two from the reception staff in regards to customer service.",3,2013,09,28
249,Great hotel with great staff and facilities,Stayed here after failing to get a room in 5 other hotels. Recession in Irish hotels? Ya right. Check in was prompt professional and courteous. Room was good. An excelleny gym in this hotel. Used it twice in the evening of arrival and morning of departure. Plenty of equipment and no waiting around etc. Breakfast was normal fare and no issues upon checkout. Overall a very positive experience as it has been before.,5,2013,09,25
249,Dont bother,"Breakfast manager needs re-training, his customer service is appalling, receptionists need showing how to smile, 
Car park validation takes on a new twist everyday, no consistency, 
The overall service has deteriorated, the best staff are in the bar area, and only 50% of them are excellent the others also need re-training.
Customer service urgently needs looked at ,,,,,",2,2013,09,25
249,Excellent Service!!,"Very good food and excellent service here, have stayed a few times with my partner and kids. Kids club and pool brilliant. Close to liffey valley sopping centre with lots of shops and a cinema which is good for the kids. Will be returning next month!!",4,2013,09,23
249,Great base for short break and going to dublin zoo,"Me, my husband and our 3 children stayed here for 2 nights including family pass to the zoo, it was well located for this purposes, junior suite was great size for family of five. Breakfast was lovely although very busy, get to breakfast early to avoid this. Leisure facilities were also very nice 
Lemon grass Chinese across the road was beautiful for eating away from the hotel. We did not try the restaurant at dinner time so cannot comment on it. Would stay in the clarion liffey valley again. ",4,2013,09,21
249,Enjoyed our stay and was impressed with the  food,"Stayed here with the girls, got a great deal wasnt expecting much to be honest, but realy good food, we had breakfast and dinner here. The bedrooms were very clean and friendly staff . Will come back again.",4,2013,09,18
249,City break,"Hotel is great for a visit to the capital whether business or pleasure, but its not in town. Walking distance to Liffey valley shopping, cinema and restaurants. It is taxi ride to the capital but they are always at the door. Lovely food in restaurant and across the road in the Arc bar. It has a very impressive gym, also a swimming pool. Staff are very helpful. ",5,2013,09,18
249,Sharon the server in the Kudos restaurant,"My wife and I and our little girl Mary had an excellent experience in the Kudos restaurant. 
We were celebrating our 28 anniversary and treated our selves to a meal in the Kudos restaurant our table service was probably one of the most professional and unbelievably pleasant ladies we've ever been served by her name is sharon. 
Sharon was run of her feet at a busy time in the restaurant and still found time to chat to my wife and our little girl. 
Sharon is a credit to the hotel and we as a family would definitely visit this hotel and restaurant. 
100 % to Sharon and the hotel. 
Ps don't put sun screen on rabbits just ask Sharon.",5,2013,09,17
249,Staying at Clarion Hotel.,"It was my pleasure to stay at Clarion Hotel. Rooms are so clean,fresh and comfy bed. I have problems with my back but not in this hotel. Stuff were very friendly and helpful and fast as well. My room was so spacious. Will recommend anyone.Priced very ,very reasonable ,WI-FI so fast .",5,2013,09,17
249,Good Room Good Facilities Good Value,"We stayed in this hotel for two consecutive nights and an additional night that of the all Ireland Final.  Having booked well in advance we did get a good package deal.  Room was good not exceptional but adequate with good selection of channels on the tv.  Gym and swimming pool were very good but the fact that we had to pay for parking 8 euros for the first two nights was disappointing.  The location of the hotel means that you really wouldn't park there unless you were using the hotel. The deal we were on was dinner, bed and breakfast.  I require a gluten free diet which I had advised when booking but when we went for dinner the choice was so limited and they were out of Lamb shank which was the gluten free choice.  Food quality was good but choice poor.",4,2013,09,13
249,Perfect Hotel,"I was up in Dublin for business and booked the Clarion Liffey Valley, I read some of the reviews and I just felt I had to leave one myself! The hotel is spotless, staff from the front desk to the rooms and in between are always friendly and willing to help! The hotel itself is in walking distance from the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, the cinema, an off license, and a restaurant.  I booked the Clarion as I was attending a seminar in the RDS, the hotel for me was in a perfect area and I will have no hesitation in returning with my family.  I had breakfast each morning - didn't have to queue, even though the hotel was fully booked (a sign in the lift shows you the best times to eat at breakfast)!! Special mention for the girl in Kudos Restaurant, I returned on all 3 evenings for a gorgeous meal, she is by far one of the best waitresses I have come across.",5,2013,09,13
249,Lovely room and food but way over-priced.,"We stayed here over the weekend for the All-Ireland Hurling Final and were gobsmacked with the price of a room only rate €118. Ridiculous.....when there was no breakfast included. We also arrived to the restaurant and were told a reservation was needed but after our non too impressed reply they had no problem getting us a table. Food was lovely but too pricey for my liking. We also had to pay to park our car there which is unfair as of the room rate we paid. We assumed this would be included in the price. To top it off, we ordered room service of one pizza and in the morning we were astounded when we were charged €34. Nothing can justify that price......!!!!",3,2013,09,11
249,Never again!!!,"I was very disappointed with the hotel, I had spent 135 euro for one night with my wife, the room was of no resemblance to the ""king executive suite"" room advertised, I had to pay in total an extra 10 euro for parking which is a disgrace after paying so much to stay. We had one hand towel in our bathroom and after asking at reception for more it took 2 hours to get them, the bathroom door wouldn't close properly, the rooms are ridiculously warm so we had to have the window open all the time which wasn't ideal with the nearby traffic, In the pictures of the room when i was booking there was a large flat screen tv in the sitting room, the one we had in our room was as old as the hills and was no more than a 22"", also the hotel describes as having pap-per-view channels, i didn't realise BBC and ITV were classed as pay-per-view. To top matters off, when we decided to have dinner on Sunday evening we were told the restaurant doesn't open on Sundays!!!WHAT????? We were told that the adjoining bar was serving food, the only problem with that was it was an Asian cuisine menu which neither of us were interested in.
To sum it up, one of the worst hotel experiences of my life and one i won't be repeating again.",1,2013,09,10
249,Mixed Bag,"stayed here 6th September , Reception efficent and friendly, maintenance guy very helpfull and friendly sorted out TV issue with a smile . came down to breakfast very busy told to find a table and that was it , tables full and filthy , staff working away while three managers stand at the entrance and have a chat while the queue got longer ,finished there chat and walked away . 
Food at breakfast ,cheap bacon burnt hash browns , no pastry ,no bread, no tea cold scramble eggs  waited 10minutes for the missing items to be brought out from kitchen
Rooms on first glance clean bit a deep clean is badly needed mold in the corners of the bathroom 
underneath the beds has not been vacumed , dust on higher ledges and tv , corridors need painting and new carpet , lifts very poor condition and this is a four star ?",2,2013,09,09
249,"Nice hotel, pity about the way it's run!","We stayed with our 10mnth old in the clarion in August, and we were pleasantly surprised with the complimentary upgrade to a suite! And it was sweet! The one thing I noticed on the way up from the car park in the lift was a sign displaying and explaining the breakfast traffic light system.  They say green is for very early breakfast and should be smooth running and red is heavy traffic and there might be a wait to be seated!  Lucky for us that we had our 10 month old alarm clock with us as we were able to go when the lights were green, as some of the hotels guest waited almost 20 mins just to be seated for breakfast!! This is unacceptable, and the traffic light system also, it's just a cover up for the breakfast room and lack of staff to deal with the number of guests!  Another gripe was the package we were on was to include an evening meal, when we had it we discovered you had to pay for potato & veg with the dinner!  This yet again another money making scheme! The last thing was the €4 a day car park charge!  I questioned if this was a Ryanair hotel! In short, I would stay here again out of convenience of location, but think the management should rethink their ideas for the sake of lasting customer satisfaction!",3,2013,09,08
249,"Loud and brash,far from 4 star","Just home from staying 2 nights at this place,hardly got a wink of sleep between 1am and 5am on both nights. There were people in the hallways running and shouting and calling security did little as that only quietened them for around 5 minutes. Had to buy a swim cap to use the pool,breakfast was very overcrowded with little selection and a number of things didn't work in the room,one being the shower being either boiling or freezing. Would not stay here agin for free,location was well outside Dublin too.",2,2013,09,08
249,Great!,"Just about to check out of here after a two night stay. We booked an executive double. Which means you have a living room in which it has a sofa bed. Rooms gorgeous. Nothing to complain about although there is no views out the window with this hotel. But I didn't mind. It's 20 euro into town in a taxi or a ten minute walk to the bus stop. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was fabulous all you can eat traditional, continental and healthy eating something for everyone! ",5,2013,09,08
249,Poor,"- Rooms were tired & shabby, grubby & tacky
- over-run with noise; kids running freely in the corridors until late at night, coaches pulling up, 
     thin walls allowing noise from neighbours above and beside
- breakfast was expensive, busy, messy, dirty...with views of discarded shopping carts and
    shabby caravans, and barely mediocre food
- you have to wear a cap to swim....and pay for this privelige?!
- not well located for getting around - local shopping centre: 10 mins away (fine for lunch etc.), 
    bus stops: 15 + mins away
- nothing 4* star about the place

The worst of it was that a bag went missing from my room! Whilst the hotel reception staff and manager took me seriously, the hotel were not prepared to accept any responsibility for this, nor offer any form of compensation, even a sincere apology!
This hotel has lost all its self-respect, and I nearly did too in staying here! Buyer beware",2,2013,09,05
249,Lethargic,"This was not my first time at the Clarion Liffey Valley but I thought I should write a review based on my most recent visit. Firstly be careful when entering the underground car park. You are meeting traffic coming out of the ground level car park whilst you are trying to turn right to enter the underground car park. We had no difficulty in getting a space near reception but the chlorine whiff from a fan near the lift was quite overpowering.  The check-in and reception was quick and efficient.  The first thing I noticed about the room was the stale smell once the door was opened.  The window didn't open too much and the room was extremely hot. I don't know how guests managed during the hot weather! We did have a fan but it wasn't working well.  The TV didn't work at first either but this was fixed quick enough. The breakfast was only very average.  I asked for a fried egg and it took ages to arrive. There were no cereal bowels or milk another morning. The food just wasn't very good but passable.  However, the one saving grace was the pool. It wasn't busy at the time we went and the changing rooms were really good, the showers had a good pressure with plenty of hot water, there were family changing rooms which are a great idea.  I just feel everything needs a bit of an injection of energy particularly the breakfasts and bedrooms. The nearby Liffey Valley centre has loads of food to choose from and it also has a cinema but this is very very expensive so be warned!",3,2013,09,03
249,Reasonable Value,"Stayed here for 2 nights during the very busy school holidays.  I thought the staff did their very best in handling the big crowds and long queues for breakfast and they were always polite and friendly.  The hotel is looking a bit worn and tired in places and could probably do with some refurbishment, but we got a very good rate, so I can't really complain.  It is a bit outside the city and beside a very busy road, but very convenient for the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and Tayto Park.  It would have been great to have air conditioning, as the room was very hot and we couldn't really open the windows due to the excessive noise from the busy road!",3,2013,09,03
249,Mixed feelings,"I stayed here for two nights, which left me with mixed feelings. On the plus side:
- Dirt cheap.
- Good Internet access included in the room rate.
- Safe deposit box that easily holds my laptop and photo gear.
- Breakfast is okay considering the price.
- The staff is very friendly and helpful.

So why doesn't this place get five stars from me?
- I'm a lonesome traveler and received a family room that sleeps four (huh - WHY?). The window can only be opened just a tiny bit, there's no aircon and the fan hardly works, so the air in the room was stale - to say the very least.
- Other than a sad shopping center and a nearby pub (Arc, which is quite good), this hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere.
- After 25 years+ of travel this is the first hotel where I must wear a cap if I want to use the pool. Come on!
- There is a shuttle between the aiport and the hotel, but it only runs every two hours or so.
- The television set must have been purchased in 1682 - or maybe in 1862 - so it's way too small and the display quality is awful.
- The amount of light at the desk leaves much to be desired.
- Where should four people who share a family room sit if there's just one chair?
- O no, not again.  A SILLY BATH TUB. Why don't you mount a shower??
- The beds are mediocre.",3,2013,09,03
249,A budget hotel by any other name!,"Similar to a lot of other reviews.  I was lucky enough to get a good deal through a website so didn't pay much for my stay.  Starting with the positives.  The lobby is nice, the pool is ok and the breakfast is good.

Now the not so good.... once you leave the lobby to go to the rooms the corridors are shabby and in need of a deep clean.  My room on the 3rd floor was unbearably hot. Small window opened a tiny bit and then all I could hear was the motorway traffic.  A fan which the front fell off therefore exposing the blades, not safe if you had anyone with you. Beds are hard with cheap pillows and duvets.

Bathrooms are basic, shower fluctuated between scalding hot and cold....again not very safe.

Although the breakfast was good the dishes weren't great, 2 dirty cups on the table I chose and you needed to check plates before using them....

Have to pay for car parking even though the car park is attached to the hotel and even if you are booked as a guest which I just don't agree with.  €4 a day.

Wifi worked ok.  TV is a big old box set with standard channels.",3,2013,09,03
249,Ok stay,The hotel looks lovely outside. Inside its very nice but I found the room quite cramped. Myself and 2 friends asked for a 3 person room and we were given a double bed and 2 single beds with I found took up a lot of room and we didn't have much room to get around. The bathroom was nice and clean and the services in the room were lovely,3,2013,09,03
249,Excellent location,"Good value for money but think its ridiculous you have to pay €4 for the car park a night. Main toilets in hotel are very dirty. Had to wait an hour for our room to be ready and the queue for the breakfast and reception was awful.  
On a positive note, excellent location. Food in  kudos was mouth watering, great choice at breakfast and always plenty of food. Swimming pool was very nice. Bedrooms were always clean. Great hotel for families.",4,2013,09,03
249,Comfortable & relaxing,"We Stayed here for 1 night. Rooms are spacious and spotless with most mod cons. Bed is very comfy. Fan was a bonus as room was really hot! Pool & sauna really nice and refreshing.  We had a 3 course meal in kudos which was divine and very reasonable (€25) per person + 2 kids eat free! Hotel is off luxury standard with friendly staff. Only downside is the queues for breakfast (30 mins) just to enter the restaurant and all for a very mediocre breakfast! Again, queues to checkout. For sure we will stay here again hopefully soon but we can honestly say we will be skipping breakfast 👍",4,2013,09,01
249,Once you walk in the door you can just relax.,Enjoyed our stay immensely. Staff were brilliant especially Coco in the Kudos bar. She should train staff in every hotel on how to treat people. Rooms were perfect. Breakfast very tasty. Pity about the queue but that was our fault for not getting up in time. I will definitely be back.,5,2013,09,01
249,So busy - wrong time of year for visit,"Like last previous review, there were queues galore.  I reckon week before back to school must be the most chaotic, but on first morning we were greeted with queue approx 75m for breakfast.  This was still relatively early (9.10am) but there was no way I was staying in it.  Fortunately we were on a RO rate, but on check-in (very pleasant girls) I paid for breakfast (2ad & 2 children - €30) .  I went to reception and asked them to deduct that morning's breakfast, which they did, no problem.
Room was stiffling - no choice but to keep window open & listen to traffic while sleeping (trying to) on top of bed clothes.
Went for 1 drink - hubby drinks Guinness and even I could see it was awful looking.  
On plus side, I got a couple of hours to myself in shopping centre, while my 3 men went to the leisure centre - they were thrilled with it.  They expected crowds, but at 4.30pm it was grand and quiet.
All in all, I was disappointed, however, I acknowledge they were flat out.
NB - breakfast 2nd morning was grand....
Tip - if on RO, try Arc for breakfast (just outside carpark) - made to order and was fab",3,2013,08,28
249,Awful queue for unready rooms,Arrived after two hour trip @ 2:35pm wif 8 year old and 2 year old to wait in a tweny min queue to be told rooms wud be another twenty mins @3:15 people still queueing and rooms still not ready my gals were getting restless and cross so we decided to leave an go shopping centre.second time round quick check in no reason r apology giving for rooms not being ready.final arrive in room we booked a family room which states one double and two singles arrive to a camp bed my youngest managed to wiggle herself between bed and radiator woke up to her crying.we were room 214 paint chipped on walls behide bed tv remote broken an a lamp that half worked.tuesday morning awoke by two knocks on door @ 9 by maid to clean room!! This is a first 4 me I dnt feel either this hotel has enough staff r maybe the managment dosent know how to manage??? 4* not likely  ,2,2013,08,27
249,Service was appauling,"I am raging as i came to this Hotel with me partner and 2 year Old daughter for a 2 night stay, i am greatly dissapointed and truely angry at the staff that aquinted us on arrival. They were truely ignorant as we aporoached reception 2 ladies stared us up and down making us feel uncomfortable, then one of the receptionist pushed the other lady ANNA forward to deal with us may i say the last thing we got was a warm welcome let alone a smile.TERRIBLE GREETING while paying for my room and as i put my hand out for my change Anna had not even the curticy to place it in my hand. This same situation also happened with my partner with the same lady different occasion. She also on arrival was får from helpful basically told us room no. not a word was spoke of hotel amenities or facilities we were left wondering the Hotel with luggage and a 2 year old in our arms climbing inapropriate stair ways with lifts in operation honestly i have to say worst Hotel iv ever been to weve of had more hospitality if wed of been sleeping rough on  a card board box on o connell Street.",3,2013,08,27
249,Weekend break,"Stayed here for one night with grandchildren.   The hotel really needs to sort out air conditioning.   We left our window open during the night,  but had to close it after a while because of the noise of passing traffic.   Once closed we heard nothing.   All of us made great use of the swimming pool and sauna.  Family rooms were comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was good.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,08,27
249,Clarion hotel liffey valley,"I would not go back to this hotel in a hurry. Staff where friendly BUT waiting in line for 25 mins for breakfast for 2 mornings with my wife and 3 children put me off. So if you are going, skip breakfast and have it somewhere else. Also as a n experienced barman. Some of the bar staff could not pull a proper pint of Guinness. So stay away from pints of Guinness folks.",2,2013,08,26
249,Great for a short stay,"Stayed on a one night package including a trip to Tayto Park. Great facilities for children & staff lovely. Room was a bit stuffy without air com but bearable, especially with the fan provided. We queued for breakfast but it moved quickly and breakfast was nice. Ideal base hotel for shopping, the zoo or tayto park.",4,2013,08,26
249,I would stay again if a little cheaper and had air conditioning,"We stayed in ur hotel from the 23-25 August 2013. First point is I was traveling by car and put the clarion hotel Liffey valley into the sat nav. Unfortunately this took us to the clarion in Dublin city center. At which point I had to drive through the centre of Dublin at half 4 in rush hour traffic to get to Liffey valley. We had 2 kids in the car and already been on the road for 2 and half hours.

Please get this sorted as is totally not on.

The hotel and rooms were clean and tidy but the real problem is there is no air conditioning. I c I am not the only one commenting on this issue. We have to small children who could not sleep at all because of the heat. How can you call urselves a 4star hotel without air con is beyond me??
The restaurant was overpriced and food was average at best. We got sirloin steak asked for medium well, it arrived totally well done and dry.

I would highly recommend skipping the restaurant and going to the kudos bar in the hotel, amazing food good atmosphere and half the price.

Overall we did enjoy our stay at ur hotel. Just the air con and the restaurant evening meal were not upto par. 
Great location as close to shopping centre and well within driving distance to city center and Dublin zoo. 

I would stay here again but only in the winter months 

Please get air conditioning installed!!!! :-)",3,2013,08,26
249,Family room was just average!,"We stayed here as a family two adults and two kids, there were three beds one double, one single and one fold up bed at the window that had wheels sticking out and between the four of us we must have hit our toes of it ten times, so a lot of tears shed! The room had no table so we had to eat snacks in our beds. The fridge was tiny for a family of four! Just about fitted a two litre of milk in for bottles! Games room had three games in it with only the pool table working, toy room had numerous toys but mostly all broken. Carpet was filthy! Mattress had lumps sticking out of it, obviously springs! As for breakfast it was really nice but you had worked up a hunger waiting for your turn to get a table! Shopping centre was half a mile walk if you had no car so had to taxi around as too long of a walk for kids. To access a bus to the city we had to yet again walk 15mins to avail of this. No grocery shop around only M&S at the very back of the shopping centre All in all without a car this hotel was not the best for kids or for adults who want everything on their doorstep!",3,2013,08,26
249,pleasant hotel,"Got holiday special offer, 2nights B&B & 1 dinner. Check-in was painless, room was 3rd floor, plenty of space, small fridge & tea/coffee facilities. Although no air-con so felt stuffy at night.  Had Breakfast 8.15ish, no qs, plenty of choice, cereal, cooked, rolls, fruit & mini croissants. By 9.30 the breakfast q was snaking around reception!
Evening meal included, could've been more variety but had fish duo, very nice. Childs menu was good esp. the large serving of ice-cream & jelly.
Small outdoor play-ground adequate for 1/2hrs exercise. Playroom also available for younger kids.
any information we needed was handily displayed inc. how busy breakfast gets and the car-park charge, this was 4 euro per 24hrs. Didn't mind as knew car was safe. Large shopping centre 5min walk away, lots of shops & variety of eating places for all tastes.
Used this hotel as base for zoo, it's 20min drive away as long as you have directions.
Would happily stay here again.",4,2013,08,25
249,Avoid this Hotel,"We stayed at the Clarion in Liffey Valley on 21st Aug 2013 and to put it mildly we were more than disappointed.  I travel quite a bit in connection with my work and I have enjoyed the facilities in the Clarion in both Cork and Limerick.  The mistake I made was that I did not check Tripdvisor before I booked into Liffey Valley and instead depended on the Clarion name. This is not a four star hotel; really I would be pushed to give it 2 stars. The following are some of my observations; A bulb missing in the bedside lamp, no air conditioning (although a pedestal fan was supplied), a remote control for the TV with a broken button… does anybody ever check this sort of thing? I was surprised that there was a charge for the car park. I appreciate that in city centre locations it is sometimes necessary to charge for parking but for a hotel on the outskirts of the city this is just another way of making money, especially when the hotel guest is not informed about it beforehand.  However, the greatest let down was breakfast.  At 9 am we had to queue for 20 minutes before we could be seated in the dining room. The difficulty arises due to the fact that the dining room is too small for the number of rooms. The tables in the dining room were so closely packed as to make it virtually impossible for the staff to do their work…in my view it amounted to a health and safety hazard as they negotiated through the narrow spaces with hands full. A final point; all of the staff we dealt with were most courteous and did their best in the situation. The problem in my view is that here is management trying to maximise profits by cutting corners. My advice: don’t stay here; there are lots of other 4 star hotels in the area which will give you a four star service for a comparable price.",2,2013,08,23
249,"I would book,  A room here again ."," I had a one night stay in the clarion , for business . The staff were very helpful and kind . The Q for breakfast was vey long and was waiting at least 15 minutes besides that , the restaurant staff were excellent and efficient . Ashley one of  the many waitress made sure I had everything I needed  and made alot of effort . I would stay in the clarion again , happy enough with my stay . ",4,2013,08,23
249,Nice hotel near Liffey valley shopping centre,"This is a nice hotel, clean, comfortable with friendly staff. It was very near shopping centre and cinema. 10 minute walk. The only problem we got a taxi from city centre and it was expensive. The buses weren't very accessible.

The room was nice, nice food and relaxing. There was wifi in the lobby but not in bedroom.  The beds were comfortable and room very clean. We stayed two nights.

I would  recommend to other guests.",5,2013,08,22
249,Very nice,Stayed here again last weekend in a suite. Very friendly staff at check in. Room was very nice and clean. Very quite at night Staff are very nice and happy to help as well. Breakfast buffet was well laid out with a good selection available. We will definitely be back. Air con in rooms would be a help especially at this time of year was warm in room. Some extra pillows in room as well. Other than that no issues.,4,2013,08,22
249,Busy and Friendly,"Myself and my mother are just after returning from a mini break in the Clarion Liffey Valley Hotel we had a lovely time,our room was good,if a bit warm,breakfast time is a bit crazy as there seemed to be a lot of guests in the hotel and they all wanted to eat breakfast at the same time,don't worry you'll get fed although you may have to queue for a while,plenty of food if a bit samey but you can't please everyone,would liked some whole fruit eg apples,oranges etc.Dinner service is also very busy advisable to book a time for your dinner,the menu didn't change the three nights we were there but no complaints lovely dishes and we got our fill.The swimming was quite busy most of the time however the kids time limit is until 7pm so it calms down then,also having eating all the lovely food we were glad to partake in the aqua aerobics two evenings of our stay,you also need to put your name down for these classes,but well worth it.Outside the hotel it's less than a five minute walk to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre where we exercised our credit cards!.All in all we definitely enjoyed our stay very busy hotel and conference centre but with friendly hard working staff especially in the dining area and restaurant.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely families as it is close to Dublin Zoo,Tayto Park and Funtaisia etc.Looking forward to returning",4,2013,08,22
249,Not up to clarion name,"Stayed here for a short family break. Must say was disappointed with the hotel, does not live up the clarion name. Rooms were of a nice size however walls were black from the dirt. Room cards wouldn't work and not one member of staff would help us get into our room. ",5,2013,08,21
249,Just average,Nothing spectacular about this hotel. The service was ok. The rooms were ok. The facilities were ok. I wasnt overally impressed. Wasnt great value for money at all. My entire family stayed for a family birthday and I honestly felt it was disappointing.,3,2013,08,21
249,No air conditioning made sleep impossible,"We stayed here in a suite for 3 nights from 14th August. Room layout was great. Room temperatures were disastrous at 28-30 deg at night. No air conditioning & only a fan to circulate warm air. Ended up with headache & very sick after 2nd night of this. Windows only open a fraction so this did not help. Hotel needs air con.
Other services & location very good but will not stay again until air con in place.",1,2013,08,19
249,Fantastic weekend,Stayed here with a group recently and had a very positive experience. The reservations staff were a pleasure to deal with before our arrival and the staff on duty over the weekend couldn't do enough for us. We had a large number of young people in our group and we were made to feel so welcome.  The food was also top class and we wouldn't hesitate in returning in the future.,5,2013,08,19
249,Great location,"Lovely hotel, loads to do for kids, playground, pool etc. we stayed in the one bed apartment and it was lovely. Great kitchenette etc. I will defiantly return again, although I wouldn't book though alpha rooms as they messed up our booking. ",5,2013,08,18
249,Disappointed,"We (2 adults and 2 children, 8 & 5)  stayed in the Liffey Valley on Thurs 8th & Fri 9th Aug. I had originally tried to book for a 4 night stay but rooms were not available. I could only get 2 nights together. We stayed in another hotel on Tue 6th & Wed 7th. In terms of our room, the temp in the room was stifling. Myself and my wife got 2 hours total of bad sleep on the Thursday night. I went to reception at 5am to complain about the heat. We had a window open and a fan on full blast all night, but with 4 of us in a room it wasnt enough. The night porter told me to report it to day shift reception which I did. The receptionist was very nice and understood that there was a problem with heat in the rooms. We got a 2nd fan for the Fri night and the temp lowered a little but having to listen to 2 fans on full power all night is not what I call a relaxing family break. I cant imagine what the hotel rooms must have been like in early July with the warm weather. Our package included dinner for E50, and we had this on one of the nights. The choice is average but in fairness the food itself was nice. However with the add ons for supplements, chips or veg etc the extra brought it to E70. I have had far better family meals for E70. 
The pool is very good and kids loved it. Breakfast was good also but you need to get in early to beat the queues that stretch all over reception.
Overall I was very disappointed with our family break at the Clarion Liffey Valley. Even our 5 year old commented how bad the room was. This hotel need A/C !!!! 
I left more exhausted then when I arrived.",3,2013,08,18
249,"Lovely accommodation, dire dining experience, overall ok","We stayed as a family for one night. We were extremely happy with our room - a suite on the 3rd floor - plenty of space, kitchen including fridge (although not equipped as advised with toaster, washer dryer etc) It was a bit of a hike from reception although this was fine as it meant it was nice and quiet. No issues with cleanliness.
As advised there's a charge for parking but it's not extortionate at 4euro per day.
We had a less than 4* dining experience - booked for dinner in the main restaurant....long wait, drinks took forever to arrive and food was mediocre.  We got a few drinks thrown around us to top it off..  Anyway to the hotel's credit they sorted this out to our satisfaction. 
Do not bother with breakfast - the queues are horrendous and you may as well go elsewhere.
If you're thinking of using the swimming pool remember to bring swimming hats otherwise you'll need to pay 3euro each which I thought was a bit pricey. Don't be expecting a top notch experience here either...rather dark and dank...the swimming attendant was on his phone / texting the whole time we were there...when we asked if there was a spare pair of goggles we could borrow (as advised may be the case by the guy at reception) he gave us a curt 'no we haven't got any' 
Overall I would recommend as long as you're not expecting a plush, genteel experience.  There are loads of kids running around and it's a busy hussle-bussling working hotel.  The accommodation is good but it is let down in other areas where they don't seem to be able to cope with the volume of guests.",3,2013,08,17
249,Just O.K.,"We stayed here for a convention at the City West Convention Center. There must have been a large number staying here for that same convention but booking in was slow and they did not have enough staff on to handle this influx. Where there for three days and felt the main desk was seriously under staffed whenever we had to go there, including our booking out. Never ever had to pay daily to park at any hotel. Strange! The hotel overall is OK but nothing exceptional. The main problem was with the swimming pool complex. It was so hot in there that I felt at the time it would be a breeding ground for bacteria. The next morning, after using it, I got a really strange sore through with, like a feeling of a lump  at the back of my throat. I am not a run to the doctor person, but was really worried about this and my doctor said I had picked up an infection. I am 100% certain as to where I picked it up from. For this reason I would not book in to this Hotel again and use their pool.
This, I believe, is a serious matter that a health inspector could well be interested in checking on.
I hardly ever get ill and I am not a hypochondriac. It took a week to get over this infection. Look in to it Clarion managers. It cost me money and time off work. Some friends of mine staying there had problems with their rooms also being far to hot and one friend complained about it and was given a fan to use in their room.",3,2013,08,16
249,Great hotel pity about the queues,"Bought a hotel deal, 3 nights b & b 1 evening dinner, standard room, upgraded to a suite at a very reasonable price. Leisure centre very nice. Location of hotel very convenient for zoo, fort Lucan, tayto park and hill of Tara. Only small issue is lengthy queues for breakfast",4,2013,08,15
249,"Some good, some bad","Good : Location, staff, Pool and facilities and comfortable beds.
Bad : €20 for breakfast as we had booked room only, just as well the shopping centre nearby offered much better value. Who pays €20 for breakfast??!! The TV in the room was like something from the 1980's, it was tiny. 
We were unfortunate enough to stay here during the recent heat wave, the hotel had no AC and all we were provided with was a desk fan.",3,2013,08,15
249,Girly getaway,"Excellent hotel, very clean, had booked a room for 3 and when we arrived we were allocated an apartment.  Apartment was very spacious ideal for families. Overall I was very impressed with this hotel will definitely be returning. Excellent value 4 money. ",5,2013,08,14
249,Not a four star hotel,"Recently stayed here with two small kids. First the positives!! 

The location is great with Liffey Valley Shopping centre beside us and the city centre not too far by car.

The swimming pool was great to have, the kids got great use out if it.

Now the not so positives!!
The rooms had no air conditioning, which is madness! The heat in the rooms was so uncomfortable and it wasn't even particularly warm the days we were staying. I got no sleep. We couldn't leave the window open as it was too noisy!

The breakfast was very disappointing. Arrived down at 9.30 (serving to 11). Had to wait 20 mins to be seated. The continental selection wasn't great at all. The selection of pastries consisted of 'pain au raisin' only!! Cereal selection really poor. Had to ask for my tea three times. I was squashed into a table, sitting on top of the poor people beside me. There were loads of dirty tables around me. Severely understaffed. 

Reception staff weren't particularly friendly. As I had a young toddler I asked about the possibility of checking in early so I could put him down for a nap. The response was 'you'll have to get in line, everybody has small children and want to check in early. Next time maybe book a room the night before you arrive and that way you can check in early'!!!! 

It really is not a four star hotel but more like a Premier Inn! ",3,2013,08,14
249,Pleasant business trip,"i really appreciate the hotel in general,
all the needed things where available inside the room, and the breakfast was gorgeous.
but some times when a bus of tourist came late in the night ,it become noisy.",4,2013,08,12
249,Nice,The hotel staff are very friend great hotel for children pool great... however we booked a meal last night for eight oclock we took kids swimming before hand .... the kids were starving the service was slow. All the adult meals arrived first. Kids were crying where theirs. We asked staff twice ... where the kids meals where 45 min later they arrived. We found it very stressful.. however tonight we will take the kids to a local restaurant.. and enjoy are trip to the zoo..,4,2013,08,10
249,Great trip,"Just back from 3 night stay with husband and 2 kids ages 8yrs and 11yrs. Gr8 hotel, very busy at meals but they seem to cope well. Two of the nights our side orders didn't arrive with mains but one of the waitresses Taryn who wasn't even our waitress noticed and got it sorted to our satisfaction! She was excellent! Pool was busy but again not a problem, my girls loved it. Was a bit concerned our room was right behind reception but absolutely no problems or excessive noise. Food in package deal.... not a massive choice considering we were there 3 nights but all dishes we tried were really lovely! Definitely stay again.",4,2013,08,09
249,Generally Good But . . . .,"I've stayed here a few times whilst working in the area. Rooms are generally spacious although some have distinctly institutional bathrooms with beige wall tiles and concrete floors, all a bit drab. No air con but all the rooms seem to have a fan - simple but effective. Rooms overlooking the central car park area can be noisey. Not helped by tour buses leaving their engines running whilst loading and unloading right outside your window.
There are two computers and printers in the reception area. Essential in this day and age for printing your boarding passes. One printer had run out of ink and the other simply didn't work so it ended up costing me €4 to print one piece of paper. When I complained to the receptionist she told me that they were nothing to do with the hotel - a very disappointing response.
Otherwise the hotel is good value for money.",3,2013,08,09
249,Great stay,"Enjoyed our stay here - clean hotel and spacious rooms.  Breakfast good however Sunday morning was manic, very noisy and busy however suppose that is not the Hotel's fault.  Would deinfately go back - location is good, we visited Kildare Shopping Village and stayed over at this hotel and enjoyed a second day in Dublin.  Good location and good price.  Basic but good.",4,2013,08,08
249,Disappointed...,"I booked this hotel as I was competing in a half marathon the following day and thought as it was out of the city it would have have been somewhat a quieter hotel. But I was sadly mistaken. 

The room was nice, even though the walls are paper thin.
I had planned to sleep around 9pm as i was to get up at 6am the next morning, but there was children running the corridors up until 12am so i did not get to sleep until after that (even with having to wear headphones to block out the noise)

I was then woken at 2:30am by screaming and shouting coming from one of the rooms where a fight had broken out, and cops needed to assist.

so all in all i got a very little sleep and that was the main reason for me to stay in the hotel.

on checking out i mentioned it to the receptionist, and all i got from her was ""there's nothing we can do about it i was a busy weekend""
 well sorry but if you want to be able to keep your 4* i suggest you learn out manage busier times a lot better than what you did",1,2013,08,06
249,Could be better,It was ok but it could have been better.No wifi in the rooms and the food in the sinergie restaurant was of extremely poor Quality.I was surprised also that the hotel lied about how many megabytes of wifi.they said 100mb but my iPad has an app that said it was a lot less.I would not book dinner there again.The hotel is in a very good location less than a minutes drive to Liffey valley shopping centre.The pool was absolutely packed.,3,2013,08,06
249,The bad experience,It is the first time when I stay in a room in front of the lifts. I have heard al the day and until in the middle of the night loud voices and doors. I could not sleep well. Never I would come back here. ,2,2013,08,06
249,Great stay,"Just back from 2 night stay here with our two girls. On arrival the room was set up with the travel cot already and also a freestanding fan which was already running. No aircon in the hotel and it was quite warm but at least they had the fan ready and we didnt have to go asking for it. 

Swimming pool was great, v clean, loads of lockers and showers, kids really enjoyed it. Games room upstairs which they enjoyed, prob better for under 5s. Nice playground outside. Staff were all really really nice and helpful. As mentioned breakfast was busy but we went at busiest time and werent waiting more than 5 minutes for a table. Loads of food and all tasty. 

Had dinner one night in the hotel restaurant and it was v good, next night we were in the other restaurant, kudos, and food was great. Music on the second night, tropical storm was just fantastic and kids were v welcome to stay and listen. 

Overall Id def recommend this hotel, great value, five minutes walk to a great shopping centre with a cinema. We'll definately be back.",4,2013,08,05
249,One night Getaway,"I stayed here with my husband and two children Friday the 2nd of August for a one night break.  It was our second time staying here this year and we are planning to return again before the Christmas as we find that it is close to the cinema and shopping centre.  Again we had a fantastic stay.  Room was spotless and staff were very friendly and helpful and at breakfast service was fast and efficient.  The hotel has lots to offer for families, fantastic pool, games room, kids club and also the outside playground.  We look forward to returning later in the year.",5,2013,08,05
249,A bit overpriced but if you got a deal would be ok,"Overall this hotel is ok, I'd struggle to really call it a 4 star hotel.
The decor looks old, grubby and need of a good clean. Our room was in desperate need of a decent cleaning, something spilt on the table and never wiped up and the floors have multiple stains...that goes for the whole hotel leisure center included.

Good points: 
good location..
free fast wifi that works. 
Staff are professional and pleasant 
breakfast food was good..not great

Bad points
Charged for parking -- unacceptable in my opinion 
everything needs cleaning/replacing
leisure center is overcrowded/not enough staff at the desk",3,2013,08,05
249,Easy to find and excellent for kids,"We found it very easy which is always good when you have z car full of kids . Receptionist more than helpful , room set up for families excellent . Spacious . Would have liked air con but it was great to be so near shopping centre . Would go back ",4,2013,08,04
249,great family friendly hotel,"This was to be a relaxing break for the two of us with our daughter, son in law and three
 grandsons. Their room was upgraded to a suite with full kitchen and utility room. Both rooms were very comfortable and all staff were very friendly and helpful.
This was a very busy weekend (bank holiday) but restaurants both evening and at breakfast were managed well to ensure the flow was smooth.
The swimming pool and sauna / Jacuzzi were well supervised and kept clean and tidy.
all in all this was as planned, very relaxing. I would recommend this hotel and we plan to use it again.",5,2013,08,04
249,Relaxing,"Stayed here Friday the 2nd of August, just me and my 5 year old daughter, just as a little get away, and was perfect for us. Rooms were spotless, staff very friendly and the food was yummy. Ill defo return my daughter is already asking when our next visit is. ,aye before she goes back to school ;)",5,2013,08,04
249,Great Hotel. But with a few flaws,"Great hotel but...Too many rooms as this reflects on breakfast ques, crowded pool and a long walk from entrance to room. Too noisy located extremely close to one of the main motorways into Dublin this made an uncomfortable sleep at night located close to a large council estates. Rooms were clean and spacious. Great location to a large shopping center that has everything to offer. Not close to Dublin and long traffic ques into Dublin if you did have a car. close to Phoenix park and Dublin zoo. free WiFi throughout the hotel (at certain times) in the evening they turn the WiFi off which was a disappointment as they had it on during the day and at evening you had to go to the lobby! breakfast selection wasn't the best either. The pool was clean but a lot of people in a small hotel pool made it uncomfortable for swimming in!",4,2013,08,03
249,Very nice hotel for just 59 euros per night,"Very good hotel not far to city centre by car. Swimming pool and gym is not in the hotel, they give you voucher and its around 15 minutes walk or 5 minutes drive. There is a bar and snacks machines. 5 minutes walk to Liffey Valley shopping centre.",4,2013,08,03
249,MarieG155,"Excellent hotel, very good value for money. Excellent staff, very professiona and welcoming.   Lots of families here when we stayed who seemed to be having a very good time. The apartments suites are excellent for families with all the facilities you would need This hotel is close to Liffey Valley shopping centre but a disatnce from Dublin city centre. The only downfall was the long line of people waiting for breakfast in the morning. If you want to go stright in for breakfast get there before 9am. Have used the gym and it is geat, also have a good pool. The Dublin city sight seeing ""hop p hop off"" bs stops outside the hotel.Have stayed in this hotel many times and hope to stay again in the near future.",5,2013,08,03
249,2nd visit - i'm delighted to say much better,"Ok a trip to Dub to see Mickey Bubbles, hotels very busy so gave this one another try and i'm delighted we did.

Arrived in 30 deg blazin heat , OMG not what we are used to.
Got a downstairs room which was a bit cooler, equipped with a much needed fan - excellent service very good, friendly helpful staff, 
good clean room,
Excellent value
first class breakfast",4,2013,08,03
249,Sleepless stay in an otherwise good hotel.,"I spent one night here recently with my husband and 3 children on a Supervalu Getaway break. Overall the hotel was very good, with friendly staff and a lovely breakfast. Unfortunately we were allocated an average size room, which really wasn't suitable for 5. There was no airconditioning but the hotel did leave a fan in the room but it didn't really make much of a difference. We had to leave the window open to get some air in but as our room was close to the main entrance there was an awful lot of noise from non residents getting taxis up to 3am. Friends travelling with us stayed in a room away from the main entrance it was much cooler, had a balcony and it was less noisy.

",4,2013,08,03
249,Fantastic value for money. Excellent service and friendly staff...,Stayed here with my husband for one night. The evening meal was delicious and staff so friendly which made our stay even better. Hope to go back again soon as I had to pay a babysitter to mind my four young children the hotel had a great special offer for the night. 109 euro altogether  for DB&B. Which was a four course meal.Will definitely be returning here... ,5,2013,08,02
249,Great business hotel on outskirts of Dublin,"I have stayed at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley on a number of occasions and have yet to experience anything other than top marks. The staff are always very professional, helpful and very welcoming. The rooms are a good size, clean, beds comfortable and good size work desk to burn the midnight oil. Internet connection is free and fast. The food is excellent and if staying in the apartments you have everything you need to make your own, M&S food store is available at the nearby shopping centre. Parking, although not free is secure and easily accessible. There is a gym etc although I have not used these facilities. Some bedrooms have balconies which I would recommend if available. Overall it is hard to fault The Clarion and I will definitely be staying again.",5,2013,08,02
249,excellent,"lovely clean hotel with very friendly staff. just back from a 2 nite stay with my husband and children and we had a ball. great havin leisure facilities onsite as this was great to keep the children occupied, lovely quiet and clean play park for the children. only downfall was that the rooms were far too hot at nite and no A/C. we had a room overlooking the motor way and with the windows open we got alot of noise. other that that i would def stay again.",5,2013,08,01
249,"""meh""","After a nightmarish 3-day stay in a hotel in England we were looking forward to a nice room, good food and sleep! We have stayed here before and had no complaints and as it was just off the N4, which we would be driving home the following day, it was the perfect choice. All started off okay. Check-in was good, quick and friendly. The room was a palace compared to the hotel we had just left but that wouldn't have been difficult. Double and single bed, nice decor, adequate bathroom, tv, desk, free wifi, iron and board, hairdryer, towels for three, clean. We ate in Kudos. Can't fault it. The food was lovely and the service was friendly and efficient. That's the good stuff.

The not so good?... the pillows provided about as much comfort and support as I imagine a quattro fromaggio pizza might though I concede, as I have never slept on a pizza, someone who has experienced both would be in a more favorable position to offer a definite comparison. 

The heat! The bloody heat! We had just escaped a sweatbox but that was in a budget hotel. We expected in this four star hotel to at least be able to maintain the room temperature at a pleasant, comfortable level to suit all of us and aide a good nights sleep. Alas, it was not to be! We opened the window which was pointless as there was about as much breeze as would be produced by a gnat sneeze (that is Mother Nature's fault though and not the Hotel) and the traffic noise was horrendous. At 2am I was so delirious from my brain cooking I soaked a towel in cold water and draped it over myself to try to cool down. Eventually slept. 

The pool, which is lovely and clean was something we were all looking forward to until we were told it closed at half seven, round about the time we arrived. Not the end of the world but far too early we feel. Our daughter was very disappointed. 

We had initially sought to book a 'room only' rate when we made our booking over the phone but got sucked into adding a breakfast we didn't get to eat as the queue in the morning was as far back as the reception desk. They do have nice breakfast as we know from a previous visit but it's not mind-blowing and certainly not worth standing in a conga line for any length of time. 

Parking was 4Euro for the night which we felt was reasonable. Very convenient for shopping, cinema, transport to Dublin city, Airport and Dublin Port. 

Overall, staff were lovely, very helpful but due to above our stay was just 'meh'. We won't be back.",3,2013,08,01
249,Not a 4 star hotel!,I stayed here for 1 night  with my husband and don't think I will be back. This hotel has a 4 star rating and I really don't know why. The room we were given was very basic old style tv poor decor etc... No toiletries bar a basic shampoo in the toilets. We went for breakfast at 8.45 am thinking it would not be too busy... We had a ten minute wait in a queue even though there were empty tables in the dining room. The staff seemed a bit scattered not able to clear tables and get them set up again. It just seemed disorganised. No one came to offer tea coffee etc.. Our breakfast was almost finished before we got a pot. The hot food was nice the usual self service. Fruit are not so good ... Just some apples. Not what I expect from a 4 star restaurant. Location is good for shopping Liffey valley at your fingertips.the lemongrass restaurant around the corner from the hotel was yummy. The gym had good facilities but the pool was too busy so gave it a miss... Looked nice though. All in all an average hotel def 3 star not 4 !!! ,3,2013,08,01
249,Enjoyable family stay in suites....,"Just back from a two night stay in a suite, was a little apprehensive based on some of the reviews but we had a very enjoyable stay at the Clarion. We stated in a 1 bed suite - more spacious than I expected with entrance hallway, bathroom, sitting room/kitchen and good size bedroom. Kitchen had a fridge, microwave, sink, dishwasher and plenty of cupboards with some plates/cups etc - perfect for our needs (fyi no oven/hob). Patio doors in the sitting room led right out onto the playground to the delight of my daughter!
We parked in the secure underground carpark - €4 fee did not bother us - one thing is that the doorway into the suites building from the carpark is not clearly marked so it took us a few attempts to find it. Don't understand why the hotel doesn't put up better signage for this.

Good points overall
- spacious, well-appointed suite. Great option for families, would return if staying in Dublin again
- good food in Kudos (Asian)
- great location in terms of access to Dublin (hotel is just next to motorway and a shopping centre so don't expect nice views!)
- lemongrass resturaunt next to hotel was lovely
- used hotel pool, good changing facilities, decent pool (was quite crowded when we visited)
- friendly staff
- free wifi

Areas for improvement
- some areas where cleanliness could be improved e.g. glass patio doors and glass doors near lifts in suite building (very grubby with hand prints...). Entrance from car park into hotel is grubby.
- very busy at breakfast time, arrive before half 8 to avoid long queues. Breakfast itself was fine - nothing special but decent enough
- no air conditioning
- no in-room movies

I would recommend this hotel - particularly the suites for families. Might not be a good option for a couple seeking a relaxing stay (at least in July/Aug).",4,2013,07,30
249,Decent Hotel (The car parking is not free),"Just returned after a one night stay here. We stayed on a room only basis.
The check in was smooth and efficient. We stayed on the same level as the reception which was handy. The family room was ample enough for our needs. The only complaint I could have about the room was the lack of air conditioning. However the hotel did supply a stand alone fan which helped to keep the room and us somewhat cool. The room had a mini bar and a safe which was free. The noise from the traffic from the hotel might be a problem if you are a light sleeper. We used the leisure facilities and found them to be of a high standard. A decent sized swimming pool (depth of 1.4metres), a kiddies pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. Like most hotels you need a swimming cap to enter the water these are available at the reception priced €3.00. When I booked the hotel the website that I nooked on (booking.com I think) advertised free car parking. This is not the case car parking is €4.00 per night not an issue for a short stay but can soon add up if you are there longer term and on a budget. There are regular buses in and out of Dublin city centre. There is a bit of a walk to get to the bus stop but it is mostly on the flat.
I would probably come back and visit again. €4.80 for a pint of the black stuff. I can't comment on the food as we did not eat there however there appeared to be an extremely long queue for breakfast on the Sunday morning. There also was a private function upstairs on teh Saturday night which did not cause much extra noise apart from 1 couple having a bit of a domestic incident. The room and the hotel and surrounding areas seemed clean and well maintained.",3,2013,07,29
249,Well done Clarion Liffey Valley!,"Our third stay at this hotel saw many improvements by way of increased menu options, meal deals and a great playground for the kids. The only negative was at breakfast one morning when one disinterested member of floor staff suggested that no further rashers would be cooked at 10.35am as breakfast had finished five minutes earlier, even though we were in the dining room from 10.15am availing of other options. A more efficient breakfast supervisor quickly rectified this. This lazy attitude of floor staff really annoys me and was reflected in the average mark for service. She just wanted us to eat up and get out so she could clean our table. More customer relations training required. All in all though, an enjoyable stay.",4,2013,07,27
249,Hotel good and child-friendly but disappointing room.,"We stayed in the middle of the heatwave and it was unbearably hot in the room.  With the motorway noise outside the window, it was impossible to sleep with the window open or closed. There was no air conditioning. The bed cover on the double bed had a stain on it and unfortunately it looked like snot!  There was something smeared on the wall beside the single bed and the soap dispenser in the bathroom was not working.  I told the lady at reception and she said she would contact housekeeping.  When we returned to the room, the bed covers had been straightened up but not changed, the wall was still smeared and the soap dispenser still wasn't filled.  The next day the bedding was changed, however, we spent three days with no soap in the bathroom.  I bought hand gel in the end.  Apart from the room, however, the hotel was very good but sleep is so important!  The swimming pool was great for the children and they were very welcome in the bar and foyer in the evenings.  Like other reviewers, I was disappointed that I had to pay for parking.",3,2013,07,25
249,not 4 star,"i stayed for 1 night in mid july. It was a very stressful stay--this hotel is not 4 star--there is no airconditioning(more about that later) no wifi,. there are charges for parking--first 3 hours free every 24 hrs 4euro. my booking stated that car parking was free so when i mentioned this at check-in i got a mumbled response. i asked that she check the website of the booking agent i had used, at this point she handed me a ticket for the car park and said to use it--thankfully this turned out to be a free pass so i did not have to pay the charge.
I informed the check-in staff that I was leaving at 04.30hrs and had noted a sign on the car park lift saying that there was no access until 11.oohrs! I was informed I could use the stairs, however, as my medical condition does not allow me to use stairs at present she then said that the desk staff at night would allow me access to the lift, just to ask them. I asked her to leave a note for the night staff as I was collecting someone off an international flight at the airport and did not want to be delayed. When I was leaving I asked the staff at the desk to allow me access to the lift--I got a very blank stare and was told I would have to wait until a different member of staff came back to the desk!!!! Luckily he arrived a few minutes later, stared blankly at the other staff member who then accompanied me to the lift. I was expecting the use of a passkey however he just pushed the lift button and it arrived---it was fully accessible!!!! When we reached the car park he asked me if I had any luggage I needed help with!!!!! this after I had wheeled my overnight bag into the lift--all very strange and not as their notices stated. I felt rather foolish for  having bothered them at all.
The room- on check in I asked for a quiet room as I was leaving so early in the morning, she proceeded to give me a room on the ground floor, bordering the car park!!! This meant plenty of noise until very late at night, people walking on the footpath outside my room and a van parked up on the footpath just outside my window!!. As it was a very hot day the curtains in the room were almost fully closed when I arrived, a little window was open, the room was very hot 30c I was very disappointed to discover no air-conditioning, I discovered that there was a door in the window frame which I opened, however as the room was on the ground floor with people walking outside I felt very much at risk--(there is a glass? partition which goes halfway up the door, but any healthy male could easily jump it)--I baked  and hardly slept at all it was so hot.
The room itself was ok in size, double bed, a little on the hard side (and I like a hard bed)-it was clean, though no bin liner in the bin.The bathroom was small but adequate. however, I bruised my leg whilst walking over to the tv. the 2 bases of the bed were not attached--one was sticking out a little with a metal knob which caught on my leg--luckily no skin broken though it was very sore for a while.....
There was a bit of a delay at check-in--only 1 person who was dealing with a family who had great difficulty getting their rooms sorted--something to do with price  as was agreed in an emiil to them but the check-in guy was saying it was not the correct rate and wanted to charge a higher rate!!! after about 10 minutes another staff member arrived to help the rest of us waiting.",2,2013,07,25
249,A hotel that is functional and a great location,"Booked this hotel as a stay over after a concert in the Phoenix park. Rooms are great and spacious. Breakfast was ok but it seemed staff where overwhelmed with the number of people. 
The hotel is clean, reception, friendly and the accommodation staff friendly too",3,2013,07,23
249,Good location but basic hotel lacking atmosphere and character.,Stayed here for 1 night and that was enough. I would not rate this as a 4 star hotel. Arriving at hotel you have to pay for parking customer or not you have to pay. Checking in was fine just not very welcoming. Our room was located on floor that they were painting the corridors which we were not advised of upon check in which I taught was bad form considering we have a 2 year aswell. Room itself was ok but basic. Bathroom very small and shower was a joke as it was hot one minute and cold next. Bed clothes were dirty and cobwebs in ceiling. No water in room which is normally service provided by a 4 star hotel. We ordered breakfast in the room and was told once it arrived that it was €15 for room tray. Expensive I taught but it then we were made pay straight away. We felt like we were not trusted to charge room service to room again service that is standard in any decent hotel. Lesiure centre changing rooms ver dirty also with towels thrown on floor and floor looked like had not seen a mop in quiet some time. I have stayed in Clarion hotels before and would have recommend them but not anymore after our stay here. ,2,2013,07,23
249,TERRIBLE!!,"How has this hotel gotten a 4 to 5 star rating?  Terrible can't begin to describe it!  It had to be the one of the worst hotel stays we've ever had.  From having to pay to park, even though we spent a lot of money to just in their hotel, to sleeping on hard beds with terrible pillows, to listening to patrons talking, singing and yelling in the parking lot out side our window at all hours of the night....  To top it all off, we had a TERRIBLE room service dinner of little tiny pizzas and garlic bread that added up to $100.00 US dollars!!!!  I can't even believe that we were not even able to make LOCAL phone calls without having to pay!  I can also go on about how the reception staff was the most unhelpful, even put out, when we asked them questions such as trying to locate where the pool was. (which by the way, closes at 7pm!  Way too early...) I have never gotten so upset with a hotel stay that I had to leave a comment of disgust, but it really was just that bad.",1,2013,07,21
249,Disappointing customer service and definately not a 4 star rating.,"In Dublin for first time as son  competing in athletics match. I found the main desk staff to be pretty uninterested . An example of this was when we departed this morning at 0615, we asked for a coffee and were informed we would be better getting a coffee at the airport and as we left didnt get as much as hope u enjoyed your stay. This sums it up!!! The next point is the rooms are stiffling hot, so bad we were unable to sleep- no Aircon.  Certainly won't recommend to anyone. ",2,2013,07,21
249,Fantastic stay,"Stayed in this hotel for night to celebrate my birthday with a friend. Check in was quick and staff were friendly. Room was spotless and we were upgraded for free to a superior room so it was really spacious with a seperate bedroom and living area. Food is the restaurant at night for dinner was just amazing. Excellant quality and again staff very friendly. Breakfast was ok, they seemed to be low on items like milk, juice etc but once it was brought to staffs attention it was refilled quickly.
The leisure centre was very busy when i was there but all the facilities were spotless.
Only down side to our stay was that the bathroom in the room was not great. While it looked clean, the tiles were very industrial and the shower was a disaster, also not enough towels in room.
Overall though i would recommed this hotel as its location is within easy access to dublin city centre, its clean, food is good and it offers really good value for money.",4,2013,07,20
249,Much better than expected.,"Stayed here one night 14/7/13, two families using one suite and one family room, and was very pleased overall.  The one big problem was the temperature - rooms have no air-con and it was 28C daytime, 20C overnight, and was not comfortable.  The suite did have a large fan which helped, but not enough.  However, given the number of days in a year that temperatures reach these levels in Ireland however, I wouldn't expect the hotel to have air-con.

Heat levels aside, the bar and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good, and the kitchen in the suite was more than adequate to allow children to have supper and a picnic to be prepared the next day for a trip to the zoo.  Buffet breakfast was good, nothing at all to complain about - be aware though that this is a large hotel catering for tour groups as well and individual travellers, so the service is not very personal - at breakfast for example, there are not individual order taken for tea and coffee, it is self-service, but if you required hot water for speciality tea, you only have to ask and it will be brought to the table.  Cleaning service was not excellent - rooms and most public areas were spotless, but some empty bottles and glasses from the previous occupants remained outside our room overnight, and some broken glass beside one of the lifts that had been reported remained there for the duration of our stay.

Swimming pool is good, again given the external temp there was a lot of customers but there was enough space for all, and a good separate kids pool.  Jacuzzi is small but adequate, didn't use steam / sauna.  There is a small outdoor playground with excellent quality equipment (swings, seesaw, climbing frame and slide, one-person roundabout!) that the kids really enjoyed, and other facilities for children that we didn't need to use.  There is also secure underground carparking (4 euro per day).

At the price, what we got was excellent - we paid less than £90 for the night for a suite for a family of four on a peak holiday weekend when a family room at the Hilton was coming in at £225 - I was expecting budget hotel but left feeling very happy.  A little bit more effort with the cleaning and I would have given the full 5/5.",4,2013,07,16
249,Great family hotel,"We stayed here 12-14th July 2013. From some of the comments on tripadviser I was wary of what we would get, but I have to say this hotel is very good. It caters well for families & there's a playroom for babies - 5 yrs & also a games room for older kids. They show a kids film at 7pm each night which we didn't go to but the films were good ones. The food was good both at breakfast & dinner with a good variety. (They do a 2 course family meal for 50 euros which was good) 
There was a live band in the bar on the Sat night which again was for adults & kids & everyone seemed to really enjoy the variety of music. The pool area is great & they have floats, rings etc out each day from 2pm for the kids to play with.
The hotel is just a 10 min walk from the Liffy Valley shopping centre which has a foodhall where we ate in 1 of the nights 
Overall this is a great hotel, my only complaint would be that there's no air-con in the bedrooms.",5,2013,07,15
249,Transient hotel only,"Very good for an overnight stay but much to big to be personable to the traveller, all the fuses blew in the restraunt just as we sat down for dinner but the staff just carried on as if nothing had happened good for us but made me think this wasn't an isolated incident.
As with other overnight hotels there was a fair bit of noise early in the morning from people returning from a night out in Dublin so don't expect a good nights sleep.",3,2013,07,15
249,No room at the Inn,"Clarion hotel Liffey Valley Dublin.

Friday 12th July & Saturday 13th July.

Due to problems at Heathrow on the Friday we did not arrive at the above until after midnight.
I had sent 2 emails to their customer supportfrom Heathrow advising of the plane fire & that we would arrive after midnight.

On arrival the night clerk advised that he was sorting out our rooms & that we could go to the bar & have a drink & sandwiches.

After over an hour he had not come to see us, so I went to find him. 

At this stage I was advised that although we had prepaid for the 2 rooms through Expedia some 6 weeks before that they had let our rooms to other guests.

We then had to wait whilst he tried to find alternative accommodation.

The alternative hotel was in an industrial location & we had to accept one of the rooms that was a smoking room.None of us smoke & this was extremely inconvenient.

It was now 2.45am.

We then had to get up early on Saturday morning to go back to the clarion.Rooms were then not ready until after 2pm. 

The reception staff were either not made aware of the inconvenience to myself My Wife or our 2 Friends.or really could not care less.We had to keep explaining what had happened.

On the Sunday morning when we went down for breakfast we were told by the restaurant manager that we were not entitled to breakfast although the previous day we were assured that the manager would be made aware.

She did eventually seat us & we had breakfast whilst she sorted out the problem.

A very frustrating time was had by all.It seems that the customer is second best.

No sleep boiling hot because of the heatwave & appalling service.

No explanation was given as to why they let our rooms go & No mention of my communications from the airport departure lounge.

I do not believe that this is very good practice & although they eventually provided breakfast for both mornings & a refund for the sandwiches. 

The level of service was appalling.

We have in fact stayed at the clarion at least once a year for the last 5/6 years

249,"Great value, a lovely experience","I recently stayed here for a night with my husband. We were on a €99 package, bed, breakfast & dinner. The hotel was busy but very efficient. The staff were excellent. For the money we were paying we didn't have any expectations of our evening meal but we were pleasently surprised. We were given a Table d'hote menu and were told that a 3 course meal was included in the package. There was lots to choose from & the food was fabulous. We had a few drinks in the bar which is very big and impersonal but it's a huge hotel so this size bar is obviously needed. The staff did their best to have a friendly word or two with everyone. We had a bit of a wait to get in to the restaurant for breakfast in the morning but it was worth it. It was a buffet breakfast and there was plenty to choose from. We will definitely be back",5,2013,07,13
249,Convenience at a good price,"It's hard to be too critical of this hotel. It's clearly popular due to its location, and it seemed very busy with tourists, business people and families when we stayed there. It could definitely do with an upgrade/spruce up as it looks faded. Room was a bit warm as well being in need of an upgrade, but for the price and location, it's fine. It was good to have access to the pool in the fitness centre next door, which it would be more discrete if you didn't have to trudge past reception to get to. Cigarette butts on the balcony as well, which should really have been cleaned before.",3,2013,07,13
249,Bad Night,"I spent the night at the Clarion whilst travelling to a sports event in which my son was competing - bad mistake! Whilst staff were all friendly and polite it became evident very quickly I had made a mistake. On entering the corridor to the bedrooms it was stiflingly hot - yes it was warm weather but no excuse for badly designed buildings - with no air circulating at all and a 'musty' smell in the corridor. entering the room we were met with a 'dank,Limey' smell and more stifling heat, despite the window being open. At least the hotel had provided a fan which did provide some relief (at least while we were awake). Obviously keeping a fan blasting all night would have prevented us getting any sleep - not that it would have mattered that much as the hotel was so noisy anyway. The walls must be paper thin as every little noise could be heard. The room was clean so not sure what the smell was.  Breakfast continued the heat theme with the orange juice from the cooler actually being room temperature - of the hotel that is - not pleasant!! Won't be returning anytime soon especially with the charge for guests to park their cars!",1,2013,07,07
249,Great value,"Great value and not too far from city center, only thing is it cost about €25 in taxi to town and the bus stop is nearly 12 minute walk away.lovely rooms and staf at reception very helpful. Very kid friendly which is good.we will be back again",4,2013,07,04
249,Middle of the road to poor accommodation,"We stayed here for 1 night as we were flying out early next morning. The rooms are all a joining so it felt less private. The balcony had cigarette butts all over so it wasn't cleaned or brushed in a while. My husband found a pair of dirty socks balled up at the side of the bed. The base of the bed had a white staining, don't know what it was. No wi fi in the rooms. Pump action soap and shower gel a fixed to the bathroom wall. And lastly, you pay for car parking even though your a guest. I'll never stay here again.",2,2013,07,03
249,Overnight stay,We stayed overnight for an early start for the ferry. the room we booked had a small fridge and a microwave with all the knives and forks readily available.The only ''bad'' experience was when trying to validate the car park ticket at the machine which kept rejecting the €2 coins. We went to the desk and the guy on the early morning shift was very grumpy. He then gave us a validated ticket. I mentioned this in an email to the hotel and the response was first class and very professional. We will certainly be staying again and will also recommend the hotel.,4,2013,07,01
249,A great place to stay,We stayed here for 2 nights and were very happy with the booking. I booked online and didn't know what to expect. It's around 15 mins by car into the Dublin city centre. We had our own car which we hired from the airport. Easy to find and the freeway goes pretty much straight to hotel. A huge selection of food from the buffet breakfast offered € 10 if you pay when you check in. The restaurant near the hotel was beautiful. Would recommend and I would stay there again,4,2013,07,01
249,Recommended for price and accessability,"For our trip we needed 4 rooms so we avoided B&Bs & settled on Choice Hotel brands for our first trip driving through Ireland.  In Dublin we chose the Liffey Valley property at half the cost of downtown, and more convenient than the airport.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and very reasonably priced with free wi-fi & parking.  We took the bus daily into Dublin @ Eu2.4 each way (about 1/4 of parking in the city).  The hotel was next to a shopping mall, but we preferred the shops in town.  We recommend it for family & friends visit to Dublin.",4,2013,06,28
249,sauna room!,"we booked a family room for one night to attend a sporting event in dublin. The room looks great on first appearances however it was so hot at night, even with the window open and the noise of the motorway behind our sleep wasn't the best. Then the toilet blocked and the bathroom was so smelly we avoided using it and used my sister's room.Breakfast was fine but the queue was rather long. 
we had deceided to take the bus to Croke Park but we waited for an hour as they we passed by all full so we ended up taking a taxi which was a lot more expensive- 30 Euro.
Overall we were offered free parking  for complaining about the room (3 euro) but i doubt i'll be staying there again- i will be looking for somewhere more central next time.",3,2013,06,28
249,Excellent...Exceeded Expectations!,"I stayed here with my mother, my 9 year old & 19 month old. We had a very spacious family room with a double, 2 singles and a cot! Having a fridge made life so much easier as the weather was hot and we are still in the milk bottle and sippy cup stage of life. We had the best fun in the pool. There were loads of other families and everyone was really enjoying themselves. The kiddie pool is a great size and considering that the baby has a fear of water and left a converted water dog it's safe to say we will be back! Breakfast was good and all the staff were lovely...no complaints! And just to note that the private playground was a pleasant surprise :-)",5,2013,06,27
249,Fantastic service,We recently booked the Pegasus room for our son's christening . The service and the food was fantastic and would highly recommend the hotel to anybody planning a party . Room and bar catered very well for the 120 people attending . Couldn't fault a thing . Robert ,5,2013,06,25
249,Sleepless in Clarion Hotel,"We arrived at the hotel at 3pm on a friday with 3 young children eager to test the swimming pool. To our dismay the room was not ready!!! We sat in the lobby for an hour before getting our room. 
We didn't get offered complimentary coffee or tea or even get directed to a more suitable place to wait instead of the front lobby with 3 young children and luggage!!
It is lacking a little in professionalism throughout. We eventually got our room but we were never informed about breakfast times or our zoo pass or any other facilities the hotel has on offer (incl in package). These details were not even in the room!!!
The breakfast the next morning was nice but the coffee was cold, I realised why when I saw the waitress walking around the restaurant, with the pre-made coffee and tea waiting for people to request it. 
Really for a family room what we had was not big enough and was very stuffy and hot (even with the heating off), the window only opens a crack so we all suffered from lack of sleep.
The pool is nice the kids all enjoyed it as did we. The baby pool is very suitable even for my over enthusiastic 2 yr old.  
It's a great location an they have some great deals and packages on their own website.
But overall I'm not sure I'd stay there again.",3,2013,06,24
249,Wouldn't recommend family room,"We have stayed in the apartments at this hotel several times & always enjoyed them. For some strange reason you can't book the apartments online and when I was trying to book an apartment on a Saturday I found it impossible.
The caller said I would be called back to make the booking which I wasn't, when I rang again I was put through to a voicemail and once again nobody rang me back.
So we were forced to book a family room as we needed to stay in this location.
The room was scruffy, marks on the wall, stains on the curtains, there was a horrible smell off the shower curtain and there were pieces of popcorn strewn on the floor.
No wifi in the room is an annoyance too. Very disappointed with breakfast - the sausages and pudding were cold and the scrambled egg had no taste off it at all.
Very disappointing stay made all the more annoying by the fact that reservations couldn't have been bothered to get back to me to book an apartment. I will never stay here again",3,2013,06,23
249,Superb family holiday break,"I stayed at the hotel last weekend with my husband and two children for a two night break which we extended by one night as we were having such a great time.We booked the hotel after receiving a letter with great offers through our door, so we booked a Tayto Park Package.

When we arrived the hotel was quite busy but has a great bussle about the place.Very obvious that is was a family orintated hotel. We upgraded our room to a family suite, which to our surprise was really impressive has a small kitchen TV room etc, which when travelling with young kids fridge is so handy, it was perfect two seperate rooms for sleeping.
My husband and kids went to the swimming pool in the morning which was great, i went accross to the shopping mall which had great shops! all happy!

We ate in the main restaurant which was really lovely and family friendly good food and choices. Staff were really friendly and overall it proved to be a brilliant family break. We will be returning in August!",5,2013,06,22
249,Great for families,"We recently spent two nights at this hotel. It was the June bank holiday weekend.  The price was great. Breakfast was excellent, tho a bit overcrowded on the Sunday morning.  The rooms were perfect for our needs.  We ate in the restaurant on the first night and it was excellent.  There were two infants in our party and the waitress was most pleasant and accommodating.  I was impressed with the fact that the brought the ""baby bowl"" to the table almost immediately, allowing the baby to be fed first.  Great idea!  My only crib is in relation to the wifi.  None available in our room, good in foyer but the seating there was limited.  Overall an excellent budget hotel.",5,2013,06,22
249,very efficient all round great stay,We had a lovely time at the Clarion the lobby is clean and fresh staff were very friendly and helpful (we needed directions etc) Room was of very high standard for a very reasonable price everything we needed was there it was comfortable extremely clean warm no complaints. Hotel is beside shopping center restaurants cinema which we found very handy. Also even though there is a club and off licence nearby we didn't hear a thing and slept soundly. I would recommend this hotel for couples solo families friends business or leisure. We will be back!,5,2013,06,20
249,Trip to the zoo,"Check in was reasonably quick and simple, we requested a ground floor room as our son was travelling and they duly obliged. The room was lovely, bed was comfortable and a cot was provided as requested. The tv and air con however, did not work, but the tv was soon fixed by housekeeping. The air con was apparently broken, which was unfortunate as it was hot that night. Pool facilities were great and we were very impressed by the private play park and kids play room. The bar staff that night were fantastic and provided hot milk for our son. Not a great nights sleep due to the hot room previously mentioned. Dove shower gel is attached to the wall instead of miniature bottles, as is the custom these days in certain hotels. Breakfast was good, however, we had to ask for a highchair twice and staff were busy clearing tables, rather than pouring coffee. On checkout, I did mention the room temperature was uncomfortable. I was told that as I had pre-payed, I was free to leave! Car park was €4 for the duration of the stay. ",4,2013,06,18
249,"over night stay with family,","I am just back from staying in the hotel as a family over night 2 adults and 2 kids, it was our fathers day gift to hubby, have to say it was very poor,, the noise of the kids running up and down the corridor at 1am and the parents just as bad, there was also a baby either next door or above us   crying from 2am till well after 4, which woke me and my youngest,  then from 7am the people were heading down to breakfast and still kids were running up and down and shouting, ,, we went for breakfast, i love the fruit, well there was no proper fruit, grapefruit was all there was, and about handful of apple in a bowl, there was no glasses for our drinks , and the table was not cleaned, we have stayed at this hotel on a number of times but have to say this was the worst stay ever,",2,2013,06,16
249,stayed for the night,We decided to stay the night as we where attending a special event at the nearby vue cinema. We only used the room for the night we didn't get breakfast or diner but did have a drink in the bar. We found it a nice hotel and would stay again if we had cause to. The price was something like €69 for the room for the two of us it was fresh and clean the bathroom was a little small but it didnt matter to us as we where only staying one night.,4,2013,06,15
249,Amazing!,"The room was gorgeous. It had a balcony where we could see the whole liffey valley area. It was so gorgeous. The hotel was clean and the room service was excellent. Ive never had fried rice that good before! It was quiet and i enjoyed my time there so much. The staffs were really friendly and helpful. The cinema and mall were just a short distance away so it was a big plus. I even wanted to extend my stay but the hotel was fully booked the next day (go figure why it was so good!). Thanks to the staffs for making my stay so enjoyable. Definately would stay there again n yes, if ur thinking whether or not to stay there..do it!u wont regret it!",5,2013,06,14
249,Not usual Clarion standard,Room needs a deep clean. Chair in room was filthy! Breakfast was disappointing. Pastries had obviously been baked day before. Were not fresh. Had booked 2 rooms through booking agency but only one booking had transferred to hotel. Thankfully was room for second one but could have been a disaster! Sloppy!,2,2013,06,14
249,disappointing,"stayed here for 1 night b&b with my partner and toddler june weekend! really disappointed with this hotel. We were never told checking in we needed to have a ""reservation"" for eating in the restaurant, we were guests so clearly we thought we could walk in and pay for it then! in all fairness they would of made more money with people walking in paying for their dinner rather than it being included in your stay! but no we were told we needed a reservation and were told half 8 we could come back...am no not with a 3 year old hungry toddler it was six o clock! we got breakfast up to the room the next morning which was a disaster, half the breakfast was missing i ordered for 3 people and got basically 2 sausages scrambled egg and bacon and got charged €15! absolute joke would not recommend this hotel.",1,2013,06,12
249,brilliant stay - will b back again!,"we arrived to find that we were upgraded to an apartment, which was briliant, the place was massive, huge kitchen, huge sitting room, the food for the breakast was lovely.. home away from home!! the reception and restaurant staff were all so friendly! we will be defo back again soon to relax in the great hotel/apartment.",5,2013,06,11
249,An absolute disappointment...,"I'm a business traveller and as such, amenities like pools etc don't concern me, all I want is a clean and efficient space.

Check-in was fine, nice friendly staff and no waiting. My room, 307, was stinking of some cleaning agent/deodouriser, a smell which was noxious in the extreme. I thought opening a windoe might help, but the window only barely openens, and was in fact already open. This is when I noticed cigarette burns in the curtains. The smell was probably masking the tobacco smell in the room.

Usual battered old TV with the wrong aspect ratio (I work in tv, sorry!)

I rang down to change rooms and this turned out to be no problem, thankfully.

Dinner was average, no actual problems, but it came quickly and was well presented... No problems with breakfast either. 

There was a 21st in the hotel on the night I stayed so it was overrun with luminious dresses and fake tan! Hardly a fault of the hotel, but some of the younger (local) clientele in the main bar were a bit rough.

I did not book this hotel, and I would not choose to stay here, ever, nor would I recommend it. Cleanliness is paramount in a hotel stay, and the rooms are obviously abused and not maintained well, and really let the rest of the hotel down.",2,2013,06,11
249,Not Good Not Bad,"The room itself was nice. The internet cable was too short and had to buy a longer one. If you don't mind sitting at the desk surfing the net, then it's okay. The speed was great. The room was clean. There wasn't a mini bar, but there was room service (3 euro fee). 

Here's something to remember: When you arrive in the evening around 6 or so, everyone and I mean everyone is in line waiting to check in. The hotel restaurant was on reservation only (book ahead). However, the bar was open and lots of places to sit. The food was okay too. If you eat first while everyone is checking in, by the time you're done, everyone is either in their room or trying to find a seat in the bar. It worked out really well for me this way. 

This is a kid friendly hotel. There were about 30 or so children in the place when I checked in. I wasn't really happy about being in a hotel with that many kids. Here's the good news. This place is huge, and they put families in a different section of the hotel. I couldn't believe how quiet it was. There's also a little play area for them. I don't think kids really use it, unless they just built it. It looks new.

The room was clean but remove the decorative pillows and decorative top on the bed. These things don't seem to be washed. I watched the maid toss them back on the bed. I never saw any of those things in the housekeeper's laundry bag. The other things were clean, even the duvet cover was washed. The pillows were a little to flat for me, but there are six in the room. The room was HOT but there was a fan, which helped. I found out that a lot of places in Ireland don't have air conditioning because of the weather there. I was there when it was warm. There is a gym and a pool that was well kept. Remember to bring a swimming cap if you want to go in the pool. There is a sauna and whirlpool. 

Don't get the breakfast! I read the other views on this site about it and they are right! Ten euros isn't worth it. I got sick and I know it was from that because I was fine until then. Most hotels have a free breakfast and this should have been one of those places. The food is way too simple and stay away from the meat! There is a restaurant next door, go there!

There are only two people at the check-in counter. I think the stress of having so many people come at them at once hinders their ability to be friendly. Not a lot of happy faces behind the counter. I had problems charging things to my room and when I asked about it, she was very short with me and raised her voice. I wasn't to happy. She proceeded to tell me that it was a deposit for the room. I told her that it wasn't. I shouldn't have had to do that. I don't deal with things like that very well. I did mention it when I checked out, and it was as if this wasn't something new. I got a simple sorry about that.  

There is a Hopper bus that drops you off at the hotel and picks you up about every other hour or so. It's 7 euros each way, which was very nice. There's also a mall nearby and there are buses that go into Dublin near there as well. The last bus back is about 11. 

I wish this was a nicer place. I would go back, but I didn't feel I got the best service. I waited an hour to get a hairdryer. I had to eventually go to the front desk (wait in line) and ask for it a third time. If you have kids or in a large group, this might be a good place to stay for a night. I saw a few businessmen/women, which this would be an okay place to stay if you had some business to do in the area. I wouldn't recommend this place if you wanted to feel pampered or on a vacation where you didn't want to feel stressed out.",3,2013,06,09
249,Breakfast awful,"The hotel itself was nice, staff are fantastic, really helpful and friendly. We had dinner which was lovely but when it came to breakfast things went down hill rapid, queuing for up to ten minutes across the lobby for a table and then when you got to the table the staff had only half set it, no tea cups and never offered tea of coffee-not the staffs fault, there was just too many people for them to cope with. The food it wasn't all that edible. They really need to improve the standard of the cereals and they need to seriously improve the quality of the meat. We left most of our food behind.",3,2013,06,08
249,Never again.,I got very large room.The room very dated tv is so far away from bed can't see it. Not clean at all. Found rubbish beside locker in room. Curtains with alot of stains on them. Under bed full off dust. Hear alot of noises. Road noise very bad. One towel in bathroom. One towel in bedroom it was so hard u couldn't use. I've stayed in one of the clarions hotel before it was way better then this one. ,1,2013,06,06
249,Not family friendly,"Where do I start, just back from a 3 night stay with my Wife and 3 kids (7yr old and 2 x 4yr olds). Kids were really looking forward to the playroom, swimming, playground etc as advertised on the website. 
Playroom: Closed for the duration of our stay - one of my children started crying when receptionist said it was closed (kept asking can we go to the playroom)
Swimming: Got up early one morning (8.00am) with my 7 yr old to go swimming and told that no children are allowed before 9am, more tears on the way back to the hotel room.
Playground: Open from 10am to 6pm daily - when we arrived the 1st night we went out to the playground and after been there for approx 5 mins were told by staff that we had to leave as the playground was closed - again more tears. 
Kids said on car journey home that they didn't like the hotel.............
Other points of note weer as follows;
Hotel Room - had an ""executive suite"" - basically a couch that turns into a double bed and in a separate room a double bed, had to ask for another bed as there was 2 adults and 3 kids - did the hotel plan to put the 3 children in together???? Regarding the TV in the room, no childrens channels, as a precausion I brought a Media Player so the kids could watch a movie but low and behold it didn't work with the TV as the TV's in the rooms are a bit dated (you'd expect Flatscreen TV's). No hairdryer or iron in room, had to ask for one. The only positive about the room was the fridge, al least the drinks for the kids were cold.
Food - had no issues with the quality of the food - but as we were on a 3 nights B&B, 3 evening meal break the menu was the same for the 3 nights - so the choice was limited. Another point I want to share is with the all inclusive meal any extras - veg, mashed potatos, chips are extra i.e a portion of veg is €3.25 that is added to your bill - €5 supplement for the steak, €5 supplement for omelettes etc. any extra's you pay extra.
Car Park - €4 per day, bit of a joke in 2013 - but I suppose we do live in rip off Ireland and you will be squeezed for all you got.
All in all not a family friendly hotel, have stayed on business trips (never a problem). Would not stay in this hotel as a family break, look elsewhere as the business travellers are priority.
Positives: close to zoo, shopping, food was good, fridge.
Negatives: see above",3,2013,06,06
249,"cheap, cheerful and clean","we stayed one night, 79 euro bed and breakfast for 2 people...fantastic value.we got a spotless travel cot for our baby to sleep in.reception staff were lovely.we had lunch in the bar, soup and sandwiches are over priced, we couldnt eat/drink the soup as it was watery and very salty. we dined in the bar again at night for convenience as our baby was tired,  disappointing, beef sczhaun was terrible, pale pieces of beef in a bowl of watery sauce, the prawns in noodles was good, carbinet sauvignon was not so good at all, bad tasting and costing over €6 per glass!! breakfaSt was good, plenty of  cereal, juice and fruit, hot food. we used the pool, facilities are clean but i thought the water in the pool to be a bit cloudy so i stayed in the baby pool with my baby. overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back again soon.",4,2013,06,04
249,Will never stay again,This is a joke of a hotel it was one of the warmest days out and the heating was turned up full blast in our room and could not turn it off by the way this was our third room after we checked in it took almost an hour before we got the right room I will never stay in this joke of a hotel again this place can ruin a night away in dublin do not stay here. ,1,2013,06,02
249,Basic Hotel,"My sister and I stayed in this hotel.Rooms were fine ,very basic.No iron/ironing board in room ,Basic bathroom products.My biggest annoyance was room service menu detailed food available .When we went to order food we were told that the menu only applies fri to sunday and actually all we could have was soup or sambo .It was only 10.30pm .If this is the case then put this on your menu so that guests attending hotel are fully informed.We then went downstairs to get take in menus as we were advised we could do only none could be found .....Very poor customer service and complete lack of organisation .Will not be returning.",3,2013,05,31
249,Good weekend,"Stayed weekend of 17th May.  Staff could not have been more helpful.  Was with my sister and mother (who uses a wheelchair).  Room was perfect for disabled access - plenty of space.  We asked for extra pillows for my mum on the first night and they were at our room within minutes of putting the phone down.  Same level of customer service at reception and in the bar and dining room.  Thoroughly enjoyable weekend - in no small part, attributable to the excellent customer service we received.",4,2013,05,31
249,Genuine Family Break? Not quite....,"Heavily pregnant, the genuine family break offered at the Clarion Hotel Dublin Liffey Valley seemed the perfect solution to a half term break with 7 and 15 year old children combined with a short flight. Come rain or shine, the hotel was able to provide (according to the online and in house brochure) a great genuine family break. '...Swimming pool activities, kids activities, dedicated kids room, arts and crafts, teen zone room and cinema nights each evening and family dining.....' sounds great, except, the pool was roped off for swimming lessons, water babies and toddler swim sessions etc and despite sterling efforts of staff that our 7 and 15 year olds could pass off as 18 ( yes really?) was closed to under 18s at 7pm. All children's activities within the hotel were closed as it was not the school summer holiday...not mentioned in the adverts. Family meal times were in a bar and provided at least some excitement, as what was on the menu wasn't what was served, ...you read steak and chips, they provide steak and mash...you read Lamb shank with garlic roast potatoes...they provide garlic roasted potatoes, mashed....fettucine with roasted veg, they serve fish of the day...with mash ( of course) two courses took two hours to serve. Sadly, the management couldn't offer a refund of monies paid, as they had provided many discounts to us already (4 cinema tickets which we couldn't use and a two hour, two course meal of food we didn't order, with adults and children's courses served separately.....) anyway, at least this will make impending labour seem relatively painless.",1,2013,05,30
249,Perfect for what we wanted,"Stayed here on two separate occasions during May. We were attending study days in the childrens hospital Crumlin. Perfect location near the hospital. Checkin very quick. Rooms fair size and comfortable. Tea and coffee available as well as a fridge perfect. Liffey valley shopping centre across the road a five minute stroll. Appeared a very busy hotel even though we stayed earlier in the week ie monday tuesday. Great price approx €60 for one night so €30 each. Would recommend this hotel. Validated parking secure underground is €4.00

",4,2013,05,30
249,A bit hit and miss,"Overall experience okay. I was at a conference. The meeting rooms were nice and they have a wide range of sizes. 

The bedrooms were clean and the beds comfortable however there are none of the little extras. Shower caps for instance could be purchased from a vending machine for €3 which is a bit much. 

I had dinner in the Friday night in the bar/restaurant. I had the duck which was really nice and everyone enjoyed their food. Breakfast however was a different matter. Long queues to get into the dining room when in fact inside was not busy but lots of the tables had not been cleared. Not enough staff clearing tables. They seemed to have been caught short or maybe a lit of staff just didn't turn up for work that morning. Breakfast was tasteless and basic. 

We had a set lunch for the conference attendees which was basic chicken mushrooms rice and quite a nice sauce or dried up fish and chips again I suppose with some 100 plus people it depends where you are in the que. and for the vegetarians they got the same meal for dinner that they had for lunch which I feel shows a complete lack of imagination on the side of the chief.

Breakfast was the same on Sunday huge queues. Some 25 plus stayed for Sunday lunch. I had a very tasteless lamb shank but I believe the did was great. 

Tea and coffee breaks. Tea and coffee rotten which always seems to be the case in hotels. They charge €3 plus and its always horrible. 

The delegates enjoyed the workshops but I believe the hotel did not treat the organisers very well. 

The staff were really lovely and worked hard. 

I travel all over the EU attending conferences and food is the one thing we don't seem to be able to do here. ",2,2013,05,28
249,"Clean, Comfy and family friendly too :)","This is a very big hotel but we couldn't fault our stay there - we really just booked it as we needed to be in the city centre early in the morning for a hospital appointment so it was for an overnight only. Our family room was lovely and big and the staff were friendly and helpful (we were initially given an incorrect room, double instead of triple, but they rectified it in minutes)
The adjoining restaurant had an Asian/fusion theme and the food was really good and well priced. Our room was surprisingly quiet too which was great. We did try to book a return stay a few months later but unfortunately there was no availability but we would definitely stay there again. Plenty of parking spaces and needless to say, very handy for shopping!!! 
Very good for the price",4,2013,05,26
249,This hotel was o.k...,"The pictures look better than the real place.  The rooms are o.k., but outdated.  Still have ""fat back"" t.v.s.  No frills.  It was clean, but nothing special.  The staff could care less if you are there or not.  They forgot to clean our room on Sunday.  It looked like a business hotel so not a lot of fun things to do.  The bar was o.k., but again the staff was not very good.  The rooms are numbered very weird with the ""600"" Rooms on the 4th Floor.  Long walk to the back elevator. The pool, spa and gym are not really part of the hotel - they just let guests use it.  It was always full with members and children's parties so not a really relaxing pool or spa stay.   The hotel location was good.  You could walk to the mall and the bus stop to Dublin was not too far away.  Next time in Ireland I would stay somewhere else.",2,2013,05,22
249,A great overnight stay!,"A lovely comfortable room in this well-located hotel for Dublin, and especially for the nearby Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Everything worked and my wife and I (with our young daughter) enjoyed a nice overnight stay. The staff we met were very courteous and friendly. 

Surprised to see an old style CRT television in the bedroom: I would have thought that it would have been a flatscreen TV. Maybe they will replace them soon!

The breakfast selection was extensive, and the hot breakfast items were well cooked and not greasy. 

Nice bar/restaurant area, although our friends lunch options were poor quality.

All in all a great hotel, especially the location right by the M50 motorway intersection.",4,2013,05,20
249,"""Room to move""","My wife and I spent 3 nights at this Hotel, the hotel is very spacious and very modern. The staff are very friendly and always available when required. This hotel is a very large hotel and convention centre so it was very busy during our stay but the hotel was large enough to cope. There is 2 good restaurants which both are of high standard and a fair price for a hotel. There is no WIFI in the rooms so you have to visit the lobby for WIFI, the lobby is very busy and not very good if you want to SKYPE. The room was spacious and clean and quite modern, the room was very hot and stuffy at night and the temperature could not be controlled. Our room faced the highway and despite the windows being closed the road noise was quite annoying at night. The fitness centre is A1 and as good as most gyms you would pay good money to visit, the pool looked amazing, however, I did not have swim but was big enough for some laps. Overall this is a great hotel and well appointed for any family, the bus stop is a 10 minute walk and the bus takes about 10 minutes to the city.",4,2013,05,19
249,A Great Place to Stay,"Clarion Liffey Valley is one of the nicest places I have stayed in Dublin despite it's vast size and being so busy. The staff are amazing they are so helpful, Friendly and efficient. The room I stayed in was very comfortable, very clean and spacious. I odered breakfast to the room and despite the fact that my room was located along way from the kitchens I actually got it on time, which in my experience is pretty rare and it was lovely. I will be staying at the Clarion Liffey Valley more often. The fact that it is located at the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is just an added bonus for those of us that had a bit of time for retail therapy.",5,2013,05,19
249,friendliest staff in ireland,"v pleasent stay in the clarion.staff excellent and v friendly.great leisure facilities and great food.would highly recco...mend it.it is near the huge
 liffy valley shopping centre and is v easy to locate just off the m50.my 3rd visit here and i will be back.",5,2013,05,18
249,would recommend,"I have been coming to this hotel for the last four years when we make a trip to Dublin.  Its in a great location, with Liffy Valley Shopping Centre across the road and a cinema. There is also buses going into the city centre just a short walk away. In the hotel the staff are very friendly, if there was a query it was acted on quickly. The rooms are very spacious, clean and tidy. Ive only had breakfast in the hotel and i didnt have any conplaints. Over all i would recommend this hotel",4,2013,05,17
249,A very family friendly hotel,"Stayed four nights; visiting our son and grandson. Well laid out rooms, clean, comfortable, and quiet. The public areas are spacious and well appointed, the hotel has a good leisure centre which can be used by all staying guests. Some good decent resaurants. We had a room service meal sent up fron 'Kudos' an Asian restaurant on the hotel. The food was first class - Nasi Goreng, Spicey Singapore Noodles, Kudos Best Curry. All excellently cooked and presented. I would recommend this hotel to anyone considering staying in the Lucan area of Dublin. My only disppointment was that I could not charge room service to the room, so had to pay cash to the room waiter. You need a credit card (as opposed to a debit card) to charge to the room. Car park was good value.",4,2013,05,16
249,Perfect for the Zoo and other activities,"Stayed on a pacakge 2 adults/2 Children. This hotel is ideal if you want to be close to the city but not deep in ththe bowels of it. The hotel provides everything you should get. There are some things that could be better but arent there always. 
The Pros : Location to Zoo -10 mins , shopping 1-min, Tayto park 30 mins. Private parking. Nice food (except breakfast) Great smwimming pool, nice lesiure centre, family friendly and easy quick check in & Out.
The Cons: Small but annoying €4 per day to park. Its far enough away from the city that parking should be free. A bit of painting in the corridors, not that its dirty just needs a lick of paint.
Overall its a 4.5 / 5 for us and we will most definately use this hotel in the future. If there was a room for children (says theres one, but we couldnt find it) it would help but im only saying this to let you know of the hotels in Dublin we've used for the Zoo this was the best.",5,2013,05,13
249,Well run with good location,"Booked a spur of the moment night with the family and found the hotel service and food very good , it was very busy weekend and they made very body feel welcome from the minute you walked in the services in the bar and restaurant was outstanding and even with children you wore made to feel welcome well worth staying if up in Dublin , plenty of parking and shopping to do while there.
The only down fall was the room we wore in was not very clean and was a let down to the hotel, however the minute this was addressed to the manager it was sorted out at once , well done",4,2013,05,13
249,Average hotel. Wouldn't recommend for a long stay.,"We stayed in this hotel on a one-night stay in Dublin. My overall impression of the hotel was average. I wouldn't want to stay here for more than two nights. The rooms weren't designed with comfort of use in mind. The beds don't offer a lot of comfort and the shower was something to be desired. There was the constant smell of stale smoke in the hallway, which made us wonder if this is a smoking hotel. The location is great and check in was easy. Staff were friendly.",3,2013,05,12
249,Excellent bar staff,"Came for a long weekend at this hotel it was a good laugh the location is not that bad its a 20 minute bus ride into centre anyway was always in the bar due to how polite and nice the bar staff was, they were always doing their best to make everything okay especially warren the man always had a smile on his face! 
",5,2013,05,12
249,"If you have a car and don't wanna pay alot while enjoying Dublin, then here to go.","I stayed one night after a business trip to Dublin, then we went to Phoenix Park the next morning which was nearby. Good reception service, express check out using the in-built electronic system via your room t.v that was fantastic. I think the car park should be free of charge! The room was spacious, but could have been cleaner. Variety of food available until late.",4,2013,05,11
249,Enjoyed our stay.,"Location is probably the only thing that lets this hotel down.  It is on the wrong side of the M50 if you want to do Dublin nightlife. The hotel was very busy with a conference crowd when we arrived Friday evening but the very efficient staff had our party of four booked in with little delay. The rooms were well sized, spotless and comfortable. A pleasant bar and restaurant were inviting but as we had eaten earlier we didn't have a meal just snacks. With the Liffey Valley shopping centre less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel, it is an ideal base for that shopping trip. The hotel does offer deals and we will probably avail of some of these before the end of summer. ",5,2013,05,11
249,Great hotel,"Our company uses this Clarion quite alot. Men are very happy with hotel & amenities, very important to us is safe, secure parking which is provided & booking is very simple with a quick e-mail. Reservation staff are a pleasure to deal with.",5,2013,05,10
249,Clarion revisited,"Booked this with AXA and for what they charged it was very good value. I had stayed here before and it was a bad experience; this time the location suited so I gave them another go. 

On arrival receptionist was anything but interested and later on the same “local” lady wasn’t too helpful when we enquired about the restaurant etc. Despite this the rooms were typical 4 star and the pool facilities were very good. The food in the restaurant was good if hard to find the price!! Our waiter was again a bit distant but did attend to our requirements

Over all our stay was good value but we also stayed at the Stillorgan Park Hotel this same weekend; same 4 star rating, same price but streets ahead in every way.",3,2013,05,07
249,"Excellent value for money, would definately reccommend friends to stay here.","Stayed for bank holiday weekend, I would definately stay here again & would recommend this hotel. Good choice for breakfast. Rooms are nice and clean, spacious. No shampoo or shower caps but can't expect extras if your only paying approx 60 euro for the room. Car park is only €4 per night & is very safe & well secured. Staff are polite & efficient. Close to Phoenix park & shopping right next door at Liffey valley shopping ctr!! ",5,2013,05,07
249,A Fairly Pleasant Stay!,"The Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley is located in West Dublin, and is about 30 minutes from downtown Dublin by city bus and 35 minutes from the airport by bus. The fare from the airport is around 7 Euros and departure schedule can be found on-line. This bus brings you right to the hotel and can return you to the airport for return travel. The purchase of a round-trip ticket when boarding may be discounted.  

The hotel is fairly nice and consists of a main building and an extended stay building. My family of four adults were provided two rooms in the second building which was showing the wear of past months use. Our suites had a kitchenette and sitting area adjoining a small bedroom with a clean bathroom, but the rooms lacked freshness and there was hair on one bed and the carpet showed stain-marks. We complained and were moved to the main building and provided two very nice Junior suites on the 5th and 6th floors. These rooms, located one above the other, overlooked the highway and provided a nice open view of the landscape. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms clean, and very pleasing overall. We used the internet in the lobby and eat breakfast served at the deli. We also enjoyed dinner in the Asian restaurant. The deli and the bar staff were cordial; other staff including front-desk were professional, but not necessarily friendly. 

The Liffey Valley Mall is located about 15 minutes walking away from the hotel; it offers many nice stores, eateries and a movie theatre. Buses to downtown Dublin must be caught outside the mall. Travelling on the city bus, we experienced very friendly fellow riders, and found that the Irish are generally quite friendly people. Temple Bar is a fun area of downtown with interesting buildings, bars, restaurants, shopping and tours. Tax-free items can be purchased at some downtown stores, but we also found one store at the airport that offered items on sale, a most unusual site at airports, at prices that were less than they were downtown.

We plan on returning to Dublin and will likely again stay at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley",3,2013,05,01
249,Going downhill.......,"Stay here on business many times as it is the closest to work.........

Always been positive experience, but not quite this time - 1st allocated room was downstairs with no view, next to office and felt claustrophobic, so asked for a change to a higher room. No probs really with the room, although no WiFi yet in rooms, bed was a bid lumpy and shower pressure low.
Where it seems to be going downhill was at breakfast - no papers unlike every other visit - 1st coffee was that strong it was like syrup and by the time it was diluted enough with milk it was cold, asked for soft poached eggs - waited 25 mins and then they came hard enough to bounce!
Bacon looked boiled and uncooked; orange juice from a machine and seems to be from concentrate.
Second coffee requested - came and to be honest didn't recognise what it was as it seems to be a tea / coffee mix.
Kudos bar area seemed tired and scruffy as well - so didn't eat there and went across the road to Lemongrass which was a good as ever especially on their Tues night deals",2,2013,05,01
249,Good restaurant and rooms - breakfast too busy,"The hotel is based out of town, which is bad if you're visiting Dublin city, but great if you're just stopping over (as we were) on your way to other parts of the country.

The restaurant offers an excellent fixe price menu. The waitress was able to identify gluten free options for me, and also found some gluten free bread for me! A good price for a good meal.

However, the restaurant is used for breakfast in the morning, and that was disappointing - the food offered was fine, but it was simply too busy. What should have been a 15 minute in-out brekky took me about an hour, as there were queues to get in (every table was busy!), queues for the self-service hot breakfast, and an endless wait for tea and coffee to be delivered. A nightmare.

The rooms are a good size, clean, and have a generously sized bathroom with bath. My room had an adjoining door which did leak sound from the excitable young children next door, though they quietened down in time for bed - I do wonder whether the noise leakage is a problem for all rooms or just those with connecting doors. It might be worth asking.

We'd stay again.",4,2013,04,27
249,Business April trip 3,This hotel should be avoided at all costs for food and the hostility of the staff in the dining areas of the hotel is completely at odds with what this country offers our visitors. The accommodation is good but this good point can not overcome the complete lack of management and leadership evident at this hotel.,2,2013,04,25
249,do not expect too much,"There is no organisation to the place and no contact between management and staff as they have difficulty organising basic things.
The nightporters are the laziest I have ever encountered. the room has a strong smell of air freshener. 
The last time I stayed there children were running through the corridors at 3am and the fire alarm went off at 5am. be grateful if you get a night's sleep in the place. Don't bother complaining.",2,2013,04,23
249,Well worth a visit,"Clean, warm, good food, great friendly staff.  Stayed one night with my wife and would have No problems returning. Everything is as should be in a chain hotel and well worth the price paid. Even after I had checked out and returned some five hours later with a problem (not hotel related) the reception staff were keen ago help. I will be staying in Dublin again soon and will not even look elsewhere for a hotel. Very close to large shopping centre and not far from city centre.",5,2013,04,22
249,Kudos Restaurant at the Clarion - 2nd time & never again,"I went to this place last week and although service was prompt the food was dreadful. I would guess that perhaps the only fresh food in the kitchen used to make these dishes is the bell peppers. The meat is no doubt bought frozen, the rice wasn't even good jasmine steamed rice and it all just tasted a little dodgy. The sauces were good but so much meat and so little vegetables it just didn't appear fresh & tasty. I was most dissappointed with the nasi goreng. I asked the waiter if it was served with a fried egg on top (typical of this dish) and he said yes, but it didn't. There was egg in the rice but not served on top as confirmed and expected - the taste was bland. Avoid this dish and avoid this restaurant. A poor use of money,",1,2013,04,20
249,Would never go back again,"We booked a double room, on line,  for the 16th. April. It was 1.00 am when we arrived and when we eventually managed to get the attention of the person in charge of reception, he was ignorant, rude and very unhelpful. As my preferred method of payment was cash I was told I would have to pay in advance and also leave a deposit of €50.00,which I would get back the  next morning, assuming we did'nt trash the room in  the meantime,(we are in our 60's). For this reason and the attitude of  the gentleman at reception, I would never go back to this hotel again",2,2013,04,18
249,A good hotel for a family trip,"We had a deal here for 2 nights B&B and one evening meal for myself, my wife and our two kids.  We had stayed here last year on a similar deal, so we knew what we were in for.  We were coming down from Belfast, so getting to the hotel was much easier than getting to many of the hotels in central Dublin.

The hotel has a fitness club attached and guests have free access to the pool, which is one of the attractions when travelling with young kids.  Our youngest slipped while going to the pool and had quite a nasty bump come up straight away, but the staff couldn't have been more attentive and provided two ice packs and then got some toys for him to play with in the water to help keep him entertained.  There was also a movie played on a large-screen TV for the kids on each of the nights we were there, but I don't know if that is available every night or only at certain times.

We visited two attractions on this trip, Dublin Zoo and Tayto Park, and this hotel was handy enough for both of those, with neither being more than 25-minutes drive away.  There is also a large shopping-centre with a cinema and restaurants attached right beside the hotel, as well as a couple of decent restaurants within the hotel complex, as well as two choices of restaurant within the hotel.

There was some minor confusion at check-in and it took two further discussions with the reception to ensure that everything was OK, but the staff are efficient and our queries were quickly dealt with. I'm also unclear whether the car park is free or not. There is a sign saying that it is €4 a night, but the pay machine for tickets says you have to get your tickets validated by reception, and when I went to reception they just gave me a ticket that enabled us to leave the car park without paying.

The only negative we had during our stay was that our room wasn't tidied after our first night, despite us leaving the sign on the door asking for it to be tidied.

Overall, it was an enjoyable stay, and it's a hotel we are likely to use again in the future.",4,2013,04,17
249,customer service 100%,"Stayed like a gift from our godparents on April 13. We were surprised by the professionalism and kindness of the staff especially in breakfast time. Nothing was to much for Danielle, she even  minded our babies when I went to collect the food (the breakfast is self service) although the restaurant was busy at the time.Went for dinner in the bar, great staff and service, drinks overpriced. In the end we had to pay for the car park!!!, never met this situation before.
For sure we will recommend Clarion for the best customer service!",4,2013,04,15
249,Worst nights sleep.,"Stayed here for one night and doubt I'd stay again. For the price, the room was surprisingly spacious and nicely decorated. However the bed itself for my liking at least was far too firm. I found it very hard to sleep and when I woke in the morning I felt stiff and sore. Worst nights sleep I ever had in a hotel. I might as well have slept on the floor. Considering how hard I found it to get to sleep I was not impressed to be woken at 9am with someone hoovering outside the door. When my husband went to check if they could possibly Hoover somewhere else he was firmly told no. With 2 small kids at home my husband and myself had been looking forward to a much needed lie in but we didn't get it. 
We didn't have dinner in the hotel but I did order one of their freshly made pizzas late that night. It's a great service to have on offer and we weren't waiting too long for it. The pizza was very tasty although it did lack toppings. I ordered their pepperoni and peppers pizza and there was literally one piece of each on each slice. 
Check in and check out was very fast and the staff were quite friendly. We were very surprised to hear though that we had to pay for the parking. Had never encountered this before. ",3,2013,04,14
249,fantastic upgrade,"We stayed here for 5 nights after Easter . It was a very good deal but it was jam packed with kids! On request for a quiet room with somewhere to sit and read they upgraded us to a junior suite which was superb. Lovely glass walls overlooking the area and very quiet. Thanks, Clarion for a superb upgrade and best value ever",4,2013,04,13
249,Great Value,"Took a two night break with two dinners, family one baby and one 3 year old, hotel really clean really good value 3 course fabulous meal on both nights and staff were so accomodating to childrens needs, pool was lovely but bar wasnt hectic kind of cold but there was entertainment on second night.",3,2013,04,12
249,You get what you pay for,"Most time I've stayed here it is because the hotel rooms were advertised at €59. 

Check in is always very slow... as is checking out. 

The hotel itself is clean and spacious, wouldn't rate the bar although we were able to have hot food served late at night. 

The rooms are all alike, clean and comfortable but don't offer much, there are no complimentary products or water therefore I am describing this hotel as basic. 

I would stay again as the price is right however, I would avoid the average check in/out times and I would be well equipped with necessities when I arrive.",3,2013,04,11
249,no heating on until 6 pm really?,"had a ground floor room which was standard hotel one, clean and big enough..the only thing that put me off completely is that i checked in at around 2 pm and it was freezing cold in the room...rang the reception and was told that the heating comes on after 6 pm and of course it takes another hour or too to heat up.....dissapointing",3,2013,04,09
249,Fine,"We stayed on the night 05th April, Good Friday. I had my wife and 2 small children with me so we booked a Double & 2 single bedroom which we got. The room rate was good but you have to pay extra for parking. I decided not to include breakfast but it was €35 for 2 Adults and 2 children under 4 which was nearly 1/2 the room cost. We decided to have breakfast elsewhere.
Staff were friendly in the hotel and the restaurant was strange as it is a Thai / Asian restaurant but serves sandwiches and more of a family restaurant. At some stage it must have attracted a certain market but needs to be looked at. Drink prices are steep.
On check out the receptionist was friendly and chatty. I discovered my car battery was dead when I got to my car. I asked the female duty manager did the hotel had a jump start unit, a number to call orany assistance to which she replied 'no, nothing we can do, best of luck'. A porter asked a taxi driver outside but to no avail. I managed to find a number for a local garage on the internet and they were out to me in an hour and it took 30 seconds to restart the car.
While it wasn't the hotel's problem I thought they could have offered even a phone number or a phone to use but not to be. When you check out you are not longer relevant.",3,2013,04,09
249,Great for familes,"We stayed over the Easter Holidays in Clarion Liffey Valley. It was quite nice. The pool however was full of kids so very hard to get a swim in if thats what you were after, but it was Easter holidays so that's probably why it was so busy. They were showing a kids movie in one of the function rooms at 8pm which I thought was very nice.
We ate in the main restaurant 'Sinergie', we had reservation for 8:30 but our table wasnt ready till 9. There was a set menu but you had to pay extra for chips, masd, veg etc so worked out expensive.",3,2013,04,08
249,awesome hotel,"real awesome hotel lovely rooms, good breakfast and very near a great shopping centre. Only drawback is that if you are going to the city centre the bus stop is quite a walk. Staff very friendly. excellent breakfast and pleasant atmosphere",5,2013,04,05
249,"Double beds = two beds stuck together - terrible, cold","Stayed in room 578 in the apartment block and is freezing.  Heating did not work and when complained, was told the heating does not come on until 7pm and switches on again at around 6am.  Dirty rooms as is the bathroom, hairs in the bed and on towels  - pet hates.

Complained and then got room 543 in the hotel - even worse- urine smell.

My advice - stay elsewhere.",1,2013,04,04
249,Good value but noisy & tired,"We've stayed in this hotel several times, but I doubt we'll return. It's cheap to stay here and the rooms are big and clean, but (like most hotels) far too hot. The hotel has a gym and pool, and this is a big draw for families. Too big a draw at peak times, when you can barely move in the pool. The leisure club needs a major overhaul - and a good clean. The equipment is old and some of it is in poor condition. The showers in the gym are covered in limescale and gunge. Horrible. The hotel is packed with what appears to be huge, sprawling family groups who thunder up and down the corridors, into the early hours, shouting and laughing. It's a problem we've encountered before. And as for breakfast, unless you are downstairs by about 0900 at weekends, forget it. The queue for breakfast snakes all the way around reception for a buffet that's so-so. Tip: walk across the carpark to the Arc Bar & Restaurant complex where they do a very good breakfast, well-priced.",3,2013,04,04
249,This used to be a nice hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel in the past with family as it's in a great location.  Good for getting into Dublin city centre and the surrounding countryside but a two night visit over the weekend left me doubting whether I'd stay here again.  We arrived early afternoon and were greeted by a long queue to check in but it wasn't a problem but it was quite a trek to get from the reception to our room on the other side of the hotel.  As we walked along the corridor and up the lift to get to our room, we passed by empty beer glasses and take-away pizza boxes.  There was also a distinct smell of stale smoke and as we entered our room, the smell was even worse.  We called the reception to advise that we couldn't stay in the room for this reason and were invited back down to change to another room.  We were told that there shouldn't have been anyone smoking in the room but whether they should or shouldn't have been, there was a distinct smell of it.  Anyway, Michael kindly arranged another room for us on another floor which was as you would expect to find it with smoke free smells and clean and fresh.  It is generally a good hotel with a good standard of furnishing and cleanliness but lacks the Irish friendliness and professionalism that we found in smaller b&bs just outside Dublin.",3,2013,04,03
249,overnight stay,"stayed here recently overnight. Was disappointed as I did not find it as friendly as on previous occassions.  Lovely girl on Reception [there was a mix up with my booking and she was very helpful, but there was a queue behind me as she was on her own and my discussion with her was public to all ].",3,2013,04,02
249,Average,Having stayed in a number of the Clarion Hotels before and really liking them I was looking forward to this but I have to say we were really disappointed. When we arrived in the car park we were greeted with broken glass all over the ground. It really didn't put my mind at rest about leaving my car in the car park. It really wouldn't have taken that much effort for someone to come out and brush it up. I found the hotel incredibly expensive due to the fact we were pretty much in an industrial estate. There was really nothing around. Breakfast was very disappointing with very little choice. Room was quite dark and dreary. The only good thing about this hotel was the gym which was very big and well equipped.,3,2013,04,02
249,Family Break Away,"We stayed here for one night recently and really enjoyed it.  From the moment we arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a family room with lots of space, did get very hot at night (no AC) though.  The bar had a great kids menu which was very reasonable and again the staff were great, even though it was busy there were no delays in getting our food.  The only fault I have was the pool, they allowed big floaters and rings in the pool which when you have two young kids learning how to swim it was hard to enjoy, great if the kids are older.  We do plan to return here as the location is perfect for Tayto Park and also the cinema and shopping centre.",4,2013,04,01
249,confused hotel,"Went to this hotel with a group. Booked through the booking system but then had a problem with my booking. Suddenly the price went up as I was standing at the counter. Husband sorted that out while I took the kids to the pool - really nice set up in the pool area for kids.
Went for dinner that was booked as part of the package but they wanted vouchers that we were not given. then they gave us the normal menu where they should have given us a limited menu (made no difference to us as we got better food but just another example of the confusion). Food was lovely, staff were nice but the front desk did not seem to communicate with the restuarant and there was an air of confusion around the place. Good location, nice facilities, nice rooms, just a pity they were not more streamline in terms of services",3,2013,03,27
249,Good value,"I have stayed here a number of times, it is a good quality budget hotel, evening food is good but breakfast is not great.  Breakfast is  a basic limited breakfast buffet; but perfectly adequate.  Rooms are dated and windows will not open more than a crack, so the rooms can be stuffy.  At €220 for 2 adults and 2 children B&B and 2 evening meals in a family room, you get more than you pay for; it is very good value.  We go back because of the good value not the quality of the food and rooms.  The food has gotten a little poorer since last time we stayed, but it is still fine.  You get 3 courses as part of the Dinner + B&B deal. Desert and main were quite good, but the starter failed to impress. The children’s menu kept the children happy.  It is not five star luxury, it is adequate accommodation and meals at a very modest price.  I would not stay here in hot weather (no A/C and windows will not open) and I would demand a room facing away from the motorway (because of noise).",4,2013,03,27
249,Busy hotel ideal for tayto park,hotel was very busy but well run.  it is an ideal base for a visit to tayto park.  it has a pool that the kids loved.  Don't come here for the views as ours was of an abandoned development wasteland.  Close to Liffey valley shopping centre.,4,2013,03,25
249,Poor customer service,"I did not expect much from this hotel as it was priced for a low service hotel. However, for some reason the cleaning staff are continously shouting in the hall in the morning. I understand they have to do there job but it gets rediculous after a stage. I had a problem with the hotel and the customer service was extremely bad. This is my first review on a hotel. I am not in the habit of complaining but I found this hotel terrible and there are plenty of better options for the money.",1,2013,03,25
249,Great hotel very convenient location for travel to/from West,"Excellent hotel, Staff helpful, underground car park, walking distance to Liffey Valley shopping centre. Pool impressive, would be an ideal place to stay if visiting Dublin and didn't want to stay in city centre.",5,2013,03,23
249,"Great gym, but pay parking????","Having stayed in the past, I choose to stay again as I'd got a very good rate online. Parking is now an additional cost at €8 per day and considering your really out of town beside a motorway I are this as being unnecessary. 

The gym is great, fab equipment and lots of space. Free weights in separate area and all you could want. Pool is very much a family area as loads and loads of kids around. Changing rooms are a little worn, but your only passing through. 

Rooms are really spacious and very clean, wifi is not available, you need to go hardwire to your pc, which could do with an update as people want to use tablets. 

Will I be back? Gym would be the only thing that brings me back, paying for parking this far out is not necessary, rooms are spacious clean and fresh, location is only suited to those with cars and looking to be well out of town. So in all, maybe depending on how good a deal I can get.",3,2013,03,23
249,Perfect St Patricks Festival Break,"Arrived at the hotel and we were very impressed with the front of house/reception, although busy because they had a lot of events going on, we were checked in quickly and efficiently. Our room was on the ground floor and we expected some road noise from our location, but absolutely nothing. Very impressed with the room facilities, and a half decent sized TV for a change not a miniscule portable. Plenty of tea/coffee etc, and the bonus of a fridge! well impressed. Bathroom immaculate and shower worked perfectly. Spa facilities above average, didnt use the gym though. Although the Hotel is located outside Dublin, a short walk to the bus stop and plenty of choice of buses into the city using our dublin bus card, well worth the money. The staff were very friendly, polite and efficient, had a totally relaxed holiday, will definiately recommend this hotel. we will be back.",5,2013,03,22
249,Great hotel - poor location,"We got a suite when the hotel made a mistake with our booking, so room-wise there's nothing bad to say. The location is pretty far from the centre but the big shopping center next to the hotel is great.",4,2013,03,20
249,Not bad but wouldn't stay again,"Firstly we arrived at around 11.45pm yet took around 20 minutes to even get checked in at the desk. We went to our room, where 3 of us were staying to find no bedding for the third person and a broken sofa bed. We called down to reception for more bedding and hate to wait about 45mins for it to arrive. We rang down again during our wait to ask where the bedding was only to be told that the man bringing it up had 'other things to do'. Not sure what is more important than bringing a guest bedding at nearly 1am as we were unable to go to sleep due to lack of bed or bedding! When he arrived he was rude and unapologetic. Aside from this, the room next door was unbelievably loud (noise from their TV) so sound ventilation isn't great! However we had an incredible meal with great service in Sinergie restaurant in the hotel.",3,2013,03,19
249,Very helpful and relaxing,"Stayed for our anniversary and paddys weekend .... Having a
Wonderful time hotel very helpful and relaxing. Staff on reception were very helpful and quick at sorting travel problems etc Sarah on reception was very efficient.",5,2013,03,16
249,"Too much Road noise , too little heat","Booked this on a rugby weekend, when prices all around peaked
Price here was good , breakfast pleatiful and tasty despite being very busy
BUT
Cold bedroom and way tooo much road noise
wouldnt return toooo many better alternatives",3,2013,03,16
249,4 star? You've got to be kidding...!!,"We booked this hotel for 3 nights for the main reason that it was a 4* hotel, had leisure facilities and was within walking distance to a shopping centre.
Admittedly, we arrived early for the check in, but I had e-mailed the hotel prior to our departure informing them that this would be the case due to the flight company's schedule.
Reception kindly allowed us a complimentary tea as we were told it would be a couple of hours before a room would be available. As we are honest people, we did not help ourselves to the ample breakfast that was taking place in the dining hall.
We had been travelling for almost 24 hours so we were exhausted, yet reception kept on pushing the check in time to later and later as no rooms were yet vacant. Although having been seated for more than 3 hours, we'd seen that plenty of guests had already checked out yet rooms were still not ready to accommodate new visitors.
Whilst in the reception area, my husband and I had the occasion to observe the general spirit of the hotel. We noticed that the majority of the guests were Irish families enjoying a weekend off from their usual routine. Kids under 10 were running about haphazardly, guests were roaming the reception area barefeet and sporting nothing more than towels, bathrobes or wet swimsuits, adult guests were leaving the breakfast room with their cuppa and bowl of cereal to smoke a cigarette outside the entrance.... Basically behaviour not at all in equation to a 4 star hotel but rather a camping site or a 2 star Spanish beach hotel!!
After 4 and a half hours wait and after hassling reception a couple times more (5 guys who were obviously staying for the Rugby match that evening had arrived AFTER us and had already been given a room...) we were given room 646 without even being told which floor this was on. I was furious that we had been ignored all this time despite us being under their nose in reception, displaying British politeness and patience and that we were the ones to always initiate the request for our booked room.
On our way to the accommodation, we were alarmed by the amount of filth that littered the corridors. Half eaten plates of beans and sausages, empty bottles of whiskey and wine coupled with ripped pizza cartons decorated the exterior of each room. Utterly repugnant and warning bells began to sound in my head.
I prayed that our room would be clean as I was ready to hit my pillow after a refreshing shower. Upon entering the room, our nostrils were hit by a waft of stale cigarette smoke. We had precisely asked for a non-smoking room. In fact, I assumed that the hotel was entirely smoke-free. We could still smell the ex occupier's cheap after shave and were forced to air the room despite pre-snow weather conditions outdoors. We were even more revolted to find a toenail clipping in full display on the carpet beside my bedside. Obviously the room had not been hoovered!! Yet, weariness got the better of us and we decided not to retaliate and ask for an alternative room as another 4 hours wait we certainly couldn't face....
The television in the room was a model that dated from the last century (obviously around the last time the hotel was refurbished...). A cathode ray specimen that even Argos doesn't sell anymore. There were teamaking facilities and a small fridge sporting a complimentary blonde hair that probably belonged to one of the Russian maids. Diluted shower gel and hand wash were also available in the bathroom. Wi fi signal was not extended to the rooms for the geeks amongst us.
It was the weekend of the big freeze yet we had to wait until 5pm to have the timed radiators put on. The room on one side of ours was occupied by what sounded like an insomniac 4 year old with rowdy parents who enjoyed a beer or two. The toddler amused herself trying to knock down the locked communal door leading to our room for most of the evening. On the other side, an agitated newborn baby obviously didn't appreciate the inaccuracy of the '4 star hotel' description either and continued to express her displeasure all night.
Breakfast was around 12,50€ more per person but my husband was adamant that given the treatment we received upon check in, that the hotel wouldn't receive one more centime or penny from us.
During our stay, the room was not made before 6pm despite vacating the room before noon and putting the 'Make Room' notice out. We had to ask 3 times at reception before the nonchalant maid finally mobilised herself to do so. It was a snowy blizzard out and all we wanted was a clean(-ish) room, well Clarion clean... new towels and more diluted shower gel.
Given the state of the service delivered, and the quantity of rowdy guests staying, we didn't dare venture into the pool, jacuzzi or gym included in the booking. The facilities were not part of the hotel it seemed, but served the general public who were members of the Sanovitae chain. We did glance through the window of the 'health club' but were immediately intimidated by the sight of bulky males with sweaty armpits. Not at all appealing.
Needless to say, we were utterly disappointed with the misleading marketing of this hotel. It was certainly not a relaxing or romantic break for us. The hotel staff were inconsiderate, disinterested and the general attitude was atrocious. Whilst families who live locally may enjoy their stay, this is definitely an experience we hope to forget rapidly.",1,2013,03,15
249,Again the clarion proves to be excellent value for money!,"I reserved my stay here by accident, I wanted to reserve the clarion in the ifsc...
But that's my fault.
Excellent value for money.
Nice staff, strange but with the clarion always at the gym I give them a ++.
Foods not bad, nothing I'd write home about but cheap and again good value for money.
I noted down the location because I am a city boy and this is two far out for me, ok it's beside the shopping centre and the airport, but with the tunnel from the city centre you can be at the airport just as fast.
Again fantastic staff and value for money...
Bravo",4,2013,03,14
249,Family get together,"Stayed with my family on the 23rd of feb. We had a nice stay and the receptionists were lovely. The floor staff were very good in the bar but i couldn't say that about the guys that worked behind the bar. The bar was also very cold. I asked the bar man to turn on abit of heat which he replied that he had already turned it on but the bar keeped getting colded(I think he turned on the cold air by mistake). The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. I also had dinner on the night. The food was very good but it could have been bigger. I was still hungry after it. The breakfast was very well run and the staff were great and well able to handle the big crowd that arrived at 9.30am. 
I woundn't knock this hotel off my list of places to go back too but not going to be rushing back.",3,2013,03,08
249,Clarion Hotel,"Have stayed at this hotel about 6 times whilst on business over the past 3 years. Have been with my family and also on my own. I recommend this hotel very highly. It is easy to get to from Dublin Airport and to get into Dublin itself There are various restaurants to choose from decent food. The rooms have always been spacious and very clean with free broadband. The staff have always been friendly and never had any problems with queues whilst booking in/out, then again I did not pick busy times to do so. The hotel is also a short walk from a large shopping complex with a cinema plenty of shops and restaurants. I have never had a bad visit to this hotel and always book when in the area.",4,2013,03,07
249,Queues everywhere,"Queues everywhere. At check in, swimming pool, dinner, breakfast & at check out. Dinner took 50 mins to get main course. Breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo. Food was rashined. Rusty element in kettle in room. Yellow stains on tiles. Shower leaking on floor. Noisy room. Was woken at up at 3am. Pool was unsupervised & dangerous for children. This is not a 4 star. I would think its closer to 1 and a half star. Lifts & room numbers were confusing. Parking was good. I would never stay again.",1,2013,03,05
249,Average nite away,"Stayed here in January while visiting a friend in lucan, easy access to the liffey valley shopping centre. 
Rooms were clean but nothing major to say about it, don't get a room in the lower level as they smell.
Bar food ok, service slow, more interested in chatting with each other than the customers, took a while to get their attention, wasn't offered dessert or coffee so just went back to the room.
Ok hotel but wouldnt be rushing back.",4,2013,02,26
249,won't stay again,"booked last minute on supervalu breaks for 78euro one night b+b with hubbie +baby. good location for us to go to ikea+meet friends. at check in told free room upgrade. yipee! room 628- walked in hit by smell sewage! bathroom clean+nice. bedroom/living room/kitchen nice but carpet filthy. rang reception re filth carpet,no travel cot as requested+smell! went for dinner 50euro bottle house wine (rotten)2 course meal for 2 was average. back to room cot up,carpet re hoovered but lots stains on carpet +still bad sewage smell.  baby needed to sleep so we didn't call reception again. angry no room change was offered. breakfast in am good selection but food cold. complained at check out -duty manager said  shed look into it re sewage smell! i was livid. we should have been offered another room or voucher/discount but t o get told that all rooms are checked prior to being occupied wasn't satisfactory! the attitude of the duty manager topped it off for us. its a modern hotel,comfy ,clean,in suburbs who can't really cope with volume of  food at big level+when things go wrong are useless! lots of families with small kids. definitely wont return and would not recommend! ",1,2013,02,24
249,Quick stay.,"Visiting frinds in Leixlip decided to stay in Capital D extra night. Got good price on a family room including dinner and breakfast. Few euros supplement for a steak was well worth it. Entertaining room for kids, but with out supervision. Bit messy. Toy all over the place. But better than nothing to keep little one happy. Clean. Nothing memorable just another hotel.",4,2013,02,24
249,Basic,Stayed of just 1 night thank goodness.  Very basic ---- we arrived and had to Que. for check in for at least 10 minutes we requested a quiet room that was suitable for someone with disabilities and received one with a shower over a bath sadly we were in a rush out and had not time to request a change.  The cleaning is also somewhat shabby upon inspection The lifts are confusing with some instructions in letters  and the control panel in numbers  the positives were good car parking facilities and a decent breakfast all be it very busy,3,2013,02,24
249,Cold cold cold,"We're staying here right now, it's 1123pm, it's minus 1 degree outside and the heating is off! After calling reception we were told that it's on a timer! In the middle of winter! I've never stayed in a hotel that has the heating on a timer. I understand they might be trying to save money but they'll lose more because nobody will want to stay. We requested a portable heater which was delivered promptly...hopefully that'll keep us going til the heating comes back on at 130am!!!
On a positive note, there was a problem with the room we were originally checked into. There wasn't another similar room available so we upgraded to an apartment with no problem and no extra cost. ",2,2013,02,23
249,Meh...,"This hotel was nothing special, but not a bad stay. Very much a typical suburban business traveler-style property, not really located near anything. The wifi was spotty, but free, with almost no signal in the rooms. The staff were very nice and helped us change rooms when we were originally put in a smoking room that smelled terribly strong like smoke. The room we ended up in was very clean and had a nice bathroom, but the walls were paper thin. We could hear people just talking in the adjacent rooms and the hallway with ease. Parking also isn't free, which I found odd for a property that has its own lot in the middle of nowhere. The people that seem to stay here on weekends are very noisy and have lots of children, so be prepared for a lot of commotion.",3,2013,02,23
249,A great hotel & convenient location for a visit to Dublin,"I took my six year old grandson for his first trip to Ireland and wanted to make sure he had a really enjoyable time. The swimming pool at The Clarion was the major draw but I was really pleased with the overall experience and it was a great half term break for him and for me. Kids are allowed in the pool from 9am to 7pm.The pool is part of the hotel's leisure centre which also boasts a gym, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.  We booked room only but two mornings we had breakfast in the hotel (12.50 Euros for adult and 5 for kids) while the other two mornings we went across the road to the Arc cafe and got a ""mini Irish"" for 5.95 Euros. Liffey Valley is only 15 minutes out of the city right by Junction 2 on the N4 so it's really handy if you have hired a car for your trip to Ireland.  The underground carpark is totally safe and secure with direct access into reception and only 4 Euros a night. The retail park next door is well worth a visit with a huge shopping mall and multiplex cinema. When we were there there was the added attraction of ""Pirates' Village"" which is a bouncy castle indoor play area with slides, water walkers and plenty to let little ones let off steam. On top of that the hotel was very comfortable, very clean and best of all very reasonable.",4,2013,02,21
249,second time staying here in this hotel and both times were excellent.,my husband and i stayed here on valentines night 2013 must say everything was up to standard.we got a great deal with four course meal included and lovely bottle of wine.meal was of excellent standard as for presentation of food it was top class.would deffinately recommend this hotel as you have every within walking distance.we didnt venture out at all as we stayed here before we just chilled in the lounge which was lovely.i will be definately be going back in the near future.thank you guys so much we had a great time.,5,2013,02,16
249,The highlight of our nights stay was leaving…  Where do I start?,"My husband and I decided to go away for the night last minute Saturday 26th Jan. The Clarion is only in Liffey Valley, a 4 star it seemed the obvious choice. BIG MISTAKE!  We booked the B&B & Dinner offer. Our arrival was not eventful reception staff friendly.  We had requested non smoking room as my husband is asthmatic we were given room 654.  Our first impression of the room was good very spacious, however a bit cold.  I checked the heater and it was warm.  Our room had disabled shower access (not required); my husband decided he would have a shower before dinner.  He turned the shower on and no water – we checked the sink and there was no issue with water from the taps just nothing from the shower.  Then we noticed the floor!! The tiles were filthy dirty in the whole bathroom.  He had to go without the shower and we went to dinner it was booked for 8 pm, we reported the issue with the shower to reception on our way and they assured us they would have it sorted out.
We arrived in the restaurant which was very cold, we would have gone back to the room to get a jumper and cardigan except it was so far away.  Our meal had a promising start Husband had chicken wings and I the Goats cheese bruschetta - both really nice.  Our mains arrived; we both opted for steak and after the first mouthful I knew the steak was gone off.  The restaurant manager offered another steak which we refused and opted to order the salmon dish – which was ok. To be honest I was already turned off my food was not particularly interested in eating.  After our delightful! Dinner we headed back to our room to find that the shower issue had not been resolved and the room was even colder that when we had arrived.  We called reception; they had no issue with moving us however they only had smoking rooms available as they had to move 5 other groups of people from their rooms that night.  We were moved to room 425 by a lovely girl called Biaba, she even carried some of our things.  When we arrived to the new room the shower was working but you are not going to believe this the room was colder than the other room.  Biaba went and got us another duvet and a plug in electric heater; she was so apologetic about the situation.  So settled into our new room with our electric heater and 2nd duvet I need to use the toilet and lifted the lid to be faced with either dirty water or dread of all dreads someone else’s pee.  I actually took a picture which I will be posting here. At this point I was actually looking for hidden cameras as I thought we were part of a candid camera TV show or an episode of Faulty Towers!! Oh Almost forgot to mention the TV was not working in our replacement room either.  After all that there was breakfast; this was an ok affair nothing spectacular but ok definitely not 4 stars!! And just in case you are wondering we will NOT be back….",1,2013,02,15
249,One night stay,"I stayed in this hotel with my family the end of January. We booked 2 rooms. When we got to our rooms the heating was not on and when we enquired was told it only came on a 5 in the evening. Have not come across this in a hotel before and as it was a cold weekend the rooms were not warm. The rooms were ok however we had a room with an adjoining door and could hear the person talking on her phone and their conversations also. The hotel was very busy with a few parties which meant the hallways were noisey late into the night. The bar is very basic and not very comfortable, no atmosphere. Breakfast was fine however, after asking for a pot of tea twice still left without receiving it. The hotel is just across the road from Liffey Vally shopping centre. I don't think I would stay again.",3,2013,02,12
249,Excellent stay,Stayed here at the weekend in a one bedroom suite. We had a wonderful stay rooms so big and airy and must say we're extremely quite at night which made for a wonderful nights sleep. Brought the kids to the pool which they loved. Breakfast Sunday morn was excellent such a wonderful choice. Would def stay again.,5,2013,02,12
249,Apartments Review,"Thumbs up!
What a lovely weekend myself, wife and two kids had. We arrived Friday evening and left Sunday morning totally relaxed. 
We had a cosy and spacious apartment (and quiet too-no slamming doors or early morning rampages/shouting which is so important with kids), lovely restaurant food and friendly and helpful staff (I requested a hair dryer and had it in minutes)
There was a really enjoyable dip in the pool which was sandwiched in between the shopping centre on Saturday morning and the bar in the evening. Can't think of anything that was missing.
When you factor in the price too we left thinking that we will definitely be back.",5,2013,02,11
249,A PLEASANT BREAK,"Located just off Dublin's M50 and very easy to find since it is a landmark as you leave the M50 this hotel offers real value for money and friendliness. Our room was excellent and the bed and sleep qulaity really good. Our dinner was a pleasant dining experience with a good selection and great quality with friendly service.

On arriving at the hotel we parked in the underground carpark with its lift into the hotel reception where we greeted by a helpful receptionist. The hotel has a fine gym and swimming pool and is great for children (out before 7pm!). 

This hotel is equally suitable for couples or for families and is near a bus route into Dublin and is beside the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.

A buffet breakfast that offered a wide selection of hot and cold food added to our already satisfying stay.",4,2013,02,05
249,Don't stay at this hotel!!!,"I have come on here to warn people NOT to fall for the cheap prices for this ""4 star"" hotel, it is NOT worth it for the following reasons:
-Distinctly average room, no bath robes, average shower, cold water.
-Unhelpful management (Andre)  - refusing to do anything to keep customers happy, when we asked to move room we were told that the hotel was fully booked, which was an absolute LIE.
-Pool, jacuzzi, steam-room and changing rooms were filthy, and water in showers cold again.

Over-all a very very disappointing stay in this hotel, will NEVER stay in a Clarion hotel again.",1,2013,02,05
249,worst hotel i ever stayed in...do not stay here....,"I have just come back from 2 nightmare nights at this hotel.checked in feb 01st and checked out 03rd feb..Staff were very friendly and food is ok but thats where the niceties stop,I booked this room on a 3rd party site for my wife and me as a weekend away for her 40th birthday, i know dublin well and i know its a nice distance from city but i didnt mind this as i got the room and breakfast for a good price, when we arrived we parked up as normal and headed to reception where we checked in straight away, The non irish staff were very nice and helpful at reception, We got our room number and headed to it, When we got to the room it looked nice, but there was a couple next door arguing loudly so we rang reception anjd requested a room change which they duely obliged us, when we were re checked into another room we got to the room to realise it was freezing cold so we went to radiator to switch it on, after 10 mins there still was no heat, This was 3.30pm approx in the afternoon, we rang reception and told them the story to which they replied that the heat doesnt come on til 5pm, i was mad, why would they let people check into cold rooms at 3pm if heat doesnt come on until 5pm, cost cutting measure obviously. it didnt end there though...we decided to head out of this cold room early so we decided to have showers, only to realise there was no hot water in shower/bath/or taps, again we rang reception and the girl said she send maintenance man up to room, he arrived 5 mins later and checked taps etc, he went off again and we got a call from reception to tell us they sending a free bottle of white wine up to us complimentary which actually was lovely chilean wine, then we got another call to tell us there was a problem with hot water in that side of building but that it was fixed but it be 40mins before water be hot enough to shower/bath in, so a cold room and cold showers...brilliant-NOT...we were at the end of our tether but decided to stay anyways and not ruin or weekend away...next morning we woke up and room freezing again so same crap about the heating off until 5pm (a disgrace this is) so we decided to book a massage for my wife ( a hour long swedish body massage) which would be ideal to forget all that happened for a while anyways, so i headed to the pool etc while my wife went to the spa, i was amazed to see her back half an hour later considering we booked an hour long massage..She was distressed and almost crying....they took her booking incorrectly and booked a half hour back massage and not an hour long swedish massage. once again they made a big boo boo leaving my wife distressed and crying, i jumped out of the pool and got dressed and headed back to the room.. as we were getting on the lift my wife tripped as the lift hadnt come down all the way and she tripped getting into it,..this can happen so we passed no remarks until we got to the room and our cards wouldnt open the door to our room...back down to reception again...turns out they had checked us out by accident...well by accident they told us anyways....The room in general (530) was horrible, poor lighting and cold and enormous cracks on the walls and ceilings and no way 4star in any way....upon checking out we highlighted all this issues to the girl at reception who was lovely and did feel bad and we could have spoke to duty manager but to be honest we just wanted to go home to our 3 young kids and back to normality, This was supposed to be a relaxing weekend away as we dont get away often alone but to be honest this was our worst nightmare and experience ever and im waiting for the hotel to ring me today about our stay....NEVER EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL.....ITS TERRIBLE.......STAFF ARE THE ONLY NICE THING ABOUT THIS PLACE TO BE HONEST,",1,2013,02,04
249,really friendly staff,"we stayed one night with baby. our room had an interconnecting door to another room which had a hen party or somesuch in it. just 2 minutes after arriving in the room we rang downstairs and asked to moved. there was no problem. we moved to another room which was identical in layout but quiet. it was lovely.
decided to have dinner in the restaurant and it was a good decision. food was lovley and the staff were so helpful. every one of them.
breakfast was lovely. great food. staff again were very nice but a lot busier than previous evening.
unlike what a previous reviewer said the parking is NOT free. its not expensive but its not free.
the view from the window is motorway beyond the fence. the landscaping had wind-blown papers etc
the hallways could've done with a bit of life. not a picture on the walls.
overall though the positives far outweigh the negs",4,2013,02,03
249,Accommodations good; Not near Dublin city attractions,"Visited Dublin while touring the country.  Spent two nights at the hotel.  Location is convenient to the airport by car or bus.  Accommodations are spacious and clean, and the staff was helpful.  My only word of caution for those looking to spend time IN Dublin - This hotel is ~20 minutes by bus, and since it is outside of the city, buses running out of town to Liffey Valley are limited.",3,2013,01,29
249,last minute choice,"Booked here last minute though a third party site. Despite over 2 hours between booking and arrival time booking hadnt come through so took almost 15 minutes to get checked in. All requests on booking were ignored as I was asked again if I would like a smoking or non smoking room, requested a high floor and quiet, got neither. receptionist was friendly though. Room was fine, clean but paint chipped off wall and upolstry on chair at desk was filthy with stains. Not 4 star standard.
Residents bar was awful, no athmosphere looked and felt like a supermarket cafe as opposed to a hotel bar. 
Were woken at 8:30am by accommodation looking to clean room even though we were a departure room and hadnt checked out out. 
By no means a bad hotel its clean and comfortable but just little things",3,2013,01,26
249,Family Friendly,"Went here with hubby & 2 kids during midterm. The room was great, had a wee kitchen which is useful when you have kids, especially for bottles. Theres was a nice couch & a dvd player in the room, again ideal for kids. The hotel itself is lovely too, nice swimming pool & the staff are all very friendly. I only have a few minor criticisms we requested a cot which was not in the room when we arrived & our 4 year old was on a sofa bed, which I didnt mind too much but they did not have any bedding in the room for it. We asked for the cot at about 7pm, thinking it would be in the room for bedtime at 8 but it wasnt taken up until 10pm. When the girl came up with the cot, we asked for bedding, she left to get it but never returned, we had to make do with what we could use out of our luggage. I believe the delay in getting the cot & the girl not returning was because it was midterm & they were really busy. We got bedding of housekeeping the following morning. We stayed for 3 nights, the second day our room wasnt serviced, again the hotel was really busy that week so I can understand why. If I was going back I wouldnt go on school holidays because otherwise it was a really nice hotel to stay in. Really close toplenty of shopping & cinema. And just a short drive from the city & zoo.",4,2013,01,24
249,Good for shopping,"Average for a 4 star hotel, rooms very comfortable, spacious and functional. Parking is available free to hotel guests. Bar is unattractive and restaurant is very average. Staff were helpful in general.",3,2013,01,23
249,Handy location...great at price,"The Clarion is easy to find on the N4 and a short drive from the M50.  The room was clean, spacious with internet access, ironing board and iron, hairdrier, tea and coffee facilities...everything you could want really.  I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. Even though the radiator in the room seemed to be working...the room was quite cold on the first night, but was a bit better on the second night. I didn't have breakfast, but enjoyed a couple of lovely meals in the bar restaurant - the curry was just wonderful!!  If I could pick something I would like to change.... it would be the awful green carpet on the corridors to the bedrooms...this lowers the tone in the whole hotel!!  Overall, it was positive and convenient for me and great at the price!",4,2013,01,23
249,3.5 stars out of 5,"Review of the Clarion hotel Liffey Valley 

Stayed in January for one night as a family of 4 

Room consisted of a 2 single beds  and a double and met our expectations.

bathroom  was  ensuite.

Parking is available around the  hotel  at an extra charge but the charge is reasonable.

Room was  comfortable although external temperature was cold during our stay .

There is a playground  suitable for young children and we used the playground on during our stay.

We ate in the restaurant -had both dinner and breakfast food for dinner was  prepared and enjoyable- compliments to the chef and waiting staff - breakfast was the usual buffet affair and  met expectations .

We obtained good value for money for a one night weekend stay and overall were satisfied with the hotel its food and its amenities.

We would stay in this hotel again if offered similar value.

We award  3.5 stars out of 5 to this hotel.",3,2013,01,21
249,Great value but rooms needs updating,"Great value but I found the hotel very industrial , charged for parking , bar very dear , restaurant has a great selection and great staff. Would stay here again but the bedrooms have stained carpets and the beds are very old",4,2013,01,20
249,Disaster.......,"Do not go in to this hotel........it is not 4 star...rooms, noise, service, staff is just ok......the only people were nice..is Housekeeping Team...management need to fired!!!. 

We arrived early for a new year party and my 2 requests (quiet and family room were never met, even i pre ordered in advance. with 2 (19 year old and 12 year old) children was send to the room with one double bed...when came back and ask reception about it, was told that rooms are not ready (4pm???) then send in to the room on the first floor, so much noise during the night......when went in to the bar, my child was served very spicy noodles even requested non spicy....overall..poor service, management do not care....very visible....disaster disaster!!!",1,2013,01,19
249,Excellent staff,"We stayed in a family room for a night in early December. All in the hotel was as you would expect from a 4 star, with the bonus of the swimming pool which the kids really enjoyed. 

The room was spacious and comfortable, without too many frills. There was a working fridge which is handy. Breakfast was buffet style so you could eat as you want. The only drawback for me was the wait for a fried egg. Having said that the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. There were some that I could not compliment enough and left you thinking that you would derfinitly go back.",4,2013,01,19
249,never again!,"We've satayed in this hotel just because we had New Year Party and it was a part of a deal.
As a family of 4 we've got 2 separate rooms miles away from each other. One room was Ok, really plain, but we had a shock when we saw the secon one....Stains on the floor and dovet cover , dirty walls...When I asked to give us another room and mentioned that it is for my mum and my daugter, they gave us a SMOKING ROOM.....for a child!!!!!!! It took me 40 mins to sort out the whole situation, by the end we've got an apartment with double bed ( again i asked for twin room), so we had to move beds ourselves....
I' would never recommend this hotel to any of my friend and definately wouldn't stay there again.
Over all it is not 4star hotel, not even 3 star....",1,2013,01,16
249,Overnight break with sister and children,We stayed at this hotel in late August we chose this hotel because it had a swimming pool playground and the shopping centre v near I was v disappointed with the room we had a double bed single bed and camp bed all packed into a tiny room the room itself was not v Caen the carpet was dirty and there was hairs in the bath hence we waited til we went to the pool and had a shower there we went to the pool to find it over packed no life guard on duty and a gang of about 20 adults teenagers and kids that were messing in the pool kids had no room to swim had to go in baby pool shower areas were ok here didn't eat at hotel that evening went to shopping centre but breakfast the next morn was v poor overall we couldn't wait to get out if this hotel wouldn't go back wouldn't recommend it and if we hadn't had a voucher that my sister won would have refused to ay the full price,3,2013,01,10
249,Well situated Hotel just off the M50,"This hotel is well located just off the M50 and within walking distance to the main Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which has a cinema also. There are a couple of restraunts accross the road from the hotel - one being the Lemon Grass which are alternative options than eating in the hotel.
Hotel rooms are clean and with plenty of space. Corridors to the rooms leave a lot to be desired and lack ventilation. The carpets look like they need to be changed and depending on your room it can be quite a walk to get there from reception. Breakfast is ok. The fryed breakfast is self service and looks like it has been cooked for some time. Staff  always seem to be over worked with delays at check etc. The pool is excellent with sauna, steam room and jacussi. Parking is not free. There is a shuttle service to the airport at certain times- not sure if it is free.You will need a car if you want to visit the city centre. There is a bus service to the city. Bus stop is a short distance away. Overall is is cheap and cheerful",3,2013,01,06
249,Very cold room,"-Ve side:Very cold room. No wireless in room,only wired broadband.poor customer service at the front desk.Im frustrated when front desk people doesnt take my request seriously.
The Hotel Manager tried to upgrade my room with reasonable price since i plan to stay for a month. But i rejected the offer and checked out from the hotel.

Good side: it had gym,spa,sauna and pool. 

",2,2013,01,05
249,Excellent Hotel,"Just back from a 1 night stay a this hotel. Great room, plenty space, no heating on but did not need it.We found the room warm. Very clean everywhere we went. No problems at breakfast, we did worry that there might be a delay as its self service but no problems.All staff were very nice and helpful.  The only thing we did not like was the underground car park, park at hotel entrance instead.
    Liffey Valley SC is very close to hotel, nice to spend a couple of hours.
Overall  we give this Hotel 9 out of 10  losing 1 mark for underground car park, I will stay here again, handy for Dublin airport.",5,2013,01,05
249,cold,"well the price is really good but its like a big cold room
i moved table twice
one customer actually had her coat on during her dinner
food was just okay
a bit like an airport hotel/restaurant 
well at least i had free parking and didnt have to drive into the city for my business meeting",3,2013,01,04
249,OK for a bed,"I normally stay in the centre of Dublin when on business, but ended up here this time, room large & ok, TV poor, we ate in the restaurant  their claim for the best curry ever is a big claim, it was very good but not the best ever. Its a minimium of a 20 euro taxi to & from Dublin centre, although the hotel is cheap, this does negate the saving. Probally would not stay again, as it is a faceless corporate hotel & I prefre a bit more characture.",3,2013,01,03
249,"Hassle, hassle, hassle","I'll start with the positives. Because of its convenient location, I have used this hotel three times in the last few months. It is on the doorstep of the Liffey Valley shopping centre and about 20 minutes from central Dublin. The hotel itself is clean, the rooms are quite big and the bar/restaurant is reasonable.

However, each time I've stayed here I've encountered problems. On my first stay, I came back to my room on the second day only to find my key card wasn't working. I went up to reception and was given a new one, which also didn't work. This rigmarole was repeated a further 3 times, at which point I demanded either to be given a key that actually works or I move room. Eventually, about 45 minutes later, the duty manager came down and gave me a new key card. The fact I wasn't offered an apology at any time during the saga didn't improve my mood.

The second time I stayed there, when I tried to check in I was told they had no record of my reservation on their system (despite the fact I had booked with them directly on their own website, and not through any third party). The receptionist resolved this fairly quickly (although had it been a busier time of year and the hotel been full, the outcome might have been less satisfactory). 

Which leads me to my most recent stay at the hotel, during which I got a combination of the two problems I had already experienced. This time, I came back on the second day to find my key card for my room wasn't working. I went to reception to get a new one. When I opened the door to my room, I discovered that it had not been serviced that day. When I went back up to reception to investigate, I was told that they only had a reservation for me for one night (not the two nights I had booked). Again, I had booked with the hotel directly through their own website and not through any third party. So I had to wait another half hour for the room to be cleaned etc and again, no word of an apology.

If I stay here again it will be because the location dictates I have to. If at all possible, I won't.",2,2013,01,02
249,"Don't stay here unless you enjoy rude staff, sticky tables and car parking charges.","Still waiting to check into our room. Unfortunately having to wait in chip and child infested greasy cafe, which is the only sitting area available since everything else is closed on a Sunday afternoon. 

Having to use my mobile roaming to write this review ad the hotel's free WiFi is only accessible if you are actually standing in reception. 

Enough said! ",1,2012,12,30
249,Good family hotel,"Stayed here with the family on return from USA.
Two good sizes rooms with adjoining door.
Rooms were a good size but were pretty dusty.

Breakfast was good and access to leisure center was a bonus - especially the kids. (dont forget a swimming hat)
Ate in the bar in the hotel and the food was pretty good.
Easy access to Dublin (bus or car) and also airport.",4,2012,12,19
249,Great Party Night,"As I had stayed here before and was going to Dublin to do some Christmas shopping we decided to take in a party night at The Clarion.  It was a very good decision, great night, food excellent and the service as always brilliant,   planning next years party night already",4,2012,12,18
249,GREAT HOTEL - PERFECT RATES,"I have stayed here on quite a few occasions and felt it was time to write a review. The Hotel is well located, near the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and most importantly, near the Hermitage Clinic. My husband spends a lot of time as a patient at the Clinic and therefore the Clarion at Liffey Valley is ideal for me. I like to book a Junior Suite or Executive Suite as truthfully, a small selection of the standard rooms have been 'well used'. Having said that, for the rates the Hotel provide, all of the rooms are perfectly equipped and spacious. The Suites are ideal if you are staying for more than one night and planning to spend time in your room and some of them have a balcony. Also perfect if you have to work during your stay, with free wi-fi in all rooms. Top marks to housekeeping, room service and bar service. Reception are so helpful and friendly. It is a very busy Hotel with plenty of atmosphere.Just a short drive to the City Centre.",4,2012,12,17
249,Christmas party a big let down,"We stayed here on sat 8th dec for abba xmas party nite. We booked this back in september for the party nite and over nite stay. We were put at the back of the room in the corner, there was too many people in the room. The queue for the bar was about 20 mins long. The service overall in the room was very slow. It was meant to be an abba nite they came on very late and played for about an hour. We had booked two rooms, they didnt put us together  got a knock on the door about noise. (We were only talking) overall would not book a xmas nite in this hotel or stay overnite.
They also need new bowls and plates alot of chips out of the plates and bowls we showed this to the waitress and all she did was stare at us and say really 
Do not stay here",1,2012,12,16
249,Great food,Clean hotel friendly staff. Food in the bar was really good and excellent value.  The only real downside was they had bells on the tables in the lounge where the wii fi worked - the bells to call for service but alas nobody came!,4,2012,12,14
249,First Time- Last Time,We stayed here on a value break for 2 nights. Room size was great with kitchen-et. My 3 year old found a pair of ladies underware behind the pull out couch- not a great start! Housekeeping came up a removed them and just shrugged her shoulders. I ask her to get the manager to contact us at some stage- No contact was made. Our bed was so uncomfortable-very hard.  Breakfast was poor. Night 2 was disturbed with noise and voices from upstairs from 2-30am until 5am. We did contact night manager to sort it out but it just lasted 10 mins. I did make a complaint on the morning of check out but I got no satisfaction from the manager apart from a free upgrade next time! I can tell there wont be a next time!! There are much nicer hotels for same amount of money. All in all we hard a bad experience of this hotel and came home exhausted.,2,2012,12,12
249,Christmas Party December 2012,"Wasn't one bit happy with the hotel, was at our Christmas party on Saturday night the food was a disgrace! There were some people queuing at the bar for a least 20 minutes or even more before they could get a drink and even then people had to get 2 or 3 drinks at once, I had to complain to the manger about the amount of people in the one room was to crowded everyone was sitting on top off each other, if there would have been a fire id say most off us wouldn't have got out that night. Also the manager on the night told me they couldn't open smoke room upstairs cause it would colaspe which meant people who smoked had to go downstairs to the entrance of the hotel for one! ABBA was the guest on the night which we all thought they were going to start early and they didn't start playing until after half eleven and they were over before half 12. Myself and other's not only from my work place but from others weren't a bit impressed at all.",2,2012,12,11
249,Children Friendly!! Drugs friendly more like!,"In order to get to our rooms, we had to walk down coridoors filled with drugs, we were infomed by the night manager that it was in hand and being dealt with!! but nothing was actually done about the drugs. 
Combined with no heating in hotel room in December, if you have children, want heating in you room, want the breakfast you ordered, or god forbid if you ant a hotel without drugs everywhere, give this hotel a wide berth. 
More worrying is the managers reluctance to act. 
stay well away",1,2012,12,11
249,disgruntled party goer,"If this hotel doesn't want noisy party goers it should consider not putting on Christmas party nights and not having a residents bar. If people go for a good time and happily spend money in their bars they should expect people to be merry and laughing. This hotel should also not put rooms booked by their Christmas party goers beside rooms with families in them,perhaps use the head and keep both groups seperate in order for both paying groups to enjoy their time there. Also ridiculous to have to pay for the carpark. wouldn't go back,would encourage people not to go there.",2,2012,12,09
249,"Kids? For value and facilities, look no further","Second stay here and I will be back again.  Great for kids, great facilities.  The location suits us but may not suit everyone.  It's handy having a big shopping centre on the doorstep.  Kudos restaurant is excellent even though it may be a little under staffed. The staff are nice. Felt welcome on both visits here.

We got exceptional value.  

On both occasions they did not a cot ready for our baby.  It took several attempts to get the cot this time too, despite mentioning it when we booked and ringing ahead.  Our baby was not impressed! Still it's worth a mention, they were really apologetic about it.",5,2012,12,08
249,Great Hotel only for the noise!,"We stayed in the Hotel to do some Xmas shopping in Dublin. The location was great parking for €4, Hotel itself was very clean with excellent facilities. As the room was so hot we had to sleep with the window open, this caused major sleeping problems! There was a night club close to the Hotel the noise levels from this was crazy this went on until about 5am on both nights of our stay,some of the Revelers were staying at our Hotel on the same floor, they had no consideration for the other guests and treated it as if it was 4 o clock in the day. I mentioned it to the Receptionist at check out and the answer I got was 'sorry'. Not good enough for us after 2 bad nights sleep!
Will not be staying there again on a weekend!",3,2012,12,02
249,Family friendly through out,"Stayed 3 nights in the executive suites which was perfect for a baby just starting to crawl. Everything was great nice breakfast and lovely bar food. Location for Dublin , Ikea and surrounds just right. Execellent value €100 per night for the suite which had a separate sitting room / kitchen with fridge, micro etc. Will use again as base of operations for next trip to the big smoke.",4,2012,11,30
249,Cheap and cheerful,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night, November 25th. We had booked a family room through a third party website, but at check in we were told that all these rooms were gone and that we were booked into a 1 bed apartment across the complex.  The apartment was very spacious, kitchen/dining/sitting room (sofa was a fold out bed), double bedroom and a bathroom.  The carpet was a bit worn and tired looking but the rest of the room was pretty decent.  Check in and out was quick and efficient.  We didn't dine in the hotel so can't comment on that.  We used the pool which was lovely.  The steam room was out of order but the sauna and jacuzzi were great.  Very clean, spacious, plenty of towels.  It's ideal for a short night away and perfect for the kids.",4,2012,11,30
249,"Busy hotel,value for money,few minor issues,not enough to spoil your stay.","A lot of what previous reviewers have put, both positive and negative comments, would be pretty accurate, though I can't fault a lot the hotel do, based on what they offer for the price. I do think this needs to be taken into consideration also when booking. I've listed them below.

Hotel offers:

   Secure parking €4/night (strange charge as its not a built up area) but a small charge to know your car is safe I guess.
   Free access and towels to the swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam rooms for residents ( reasonable size pool, but gets busy at weekends as I think local people also subscribe to use it.)
   An above average breakfast consisting of cereals,fruit,breads,pastries and a good selection of cooked options.Staff are very busy but very helpful, they really try their best to please.
(On both mornings we ordered poached eggs this was not a problem,and served to our table.with the large volume of people staying here probably due to the keen rates, breakfast queues are inevitable at peak times.try going earlier for breakfast. Also, some of the problems are caused by residents too.One table beside us made endless trips to get extra food for their table, then left enough food on table to feed 4 people, very wasteful and taking advantage of the hotel allowing us free choices at breakfast.This slows staff down,clearing it all away.)

   At times check in can be slow 10-15 mins.(maybe that's not too bad) 
   Convenient to M50 if arriving by car. M4 Galway road.
   Close to Liffey Valley shopping Centre and Vue Cinema.Both within 10 minutes walking distance.
Approx.15 minutes from hotel, 5 minutes from shopping centre,take the pedestrian bridge over the N4 motorway,is the bus stop. This will bring you into Dublin City centre.( if you select the correct number it brings you in past Ballyfermot which is faster than the one that goes through Palmerstown and down past Pheonix Park.
 
 
Hope this helps you choose if its right for you. I've listed our experiences below.

We have stayed here twice, First time, we got to our room it had a strong smell of smoke, it was non-smoking, rang reception, they moved us to another room quickly (can't really blame hotel if residents break rules and smoke in it)
 All was good with the room, clean, TV, with plenty of channels, tea/coffee, etc. Everything was fine until night time and because some of these rooms are connected by a door, next door TV was on loud. This continued late into the night and was back on early.We got through the night, but unfortunately it was the same all Saturday night and early Sunday morning. This did spoil our stay. We didn't complain, but when asked on check out was asked if all was ok with our stay, I explained and the Duty manager came, listened to what had happened and apologised, said we should have told reception at the time, and offered us a special price on a room for a future stay. I thought this was very reasonable, and hence our return this weekend. 

 Its not a hotel for a peaceful break, due to high volume of people in it, and poor sound proofing. But also, some people staying don't help. Why keep the TV on loud all night or why let your kids treat the corridor like a play park and run up and down creating a din through thin walls.

Hotel location is out of city, not a big problem if you are mobile and can walk to bus stop, if not taxis would add considerable cost,and City centre car parking in Dublin seems to be about €4 / hour! well any we used,if you are to take your car in,also city centre traffic is slow,so you will loose a lot of time.Bus lanes allow for much faster travel by bus.

We never got a chance to try the restaurant so can't comment on it.

When I went to check in on Friday, the particular Card I had didn't suit the hotel system so the guy on reception asked for cash up front. I explained I had an email from hotel to say I'd been there before and that I would get cash when i was next out at the cash machine. He said no, and that I would have to go to shopping centre and get money first, I guess they have rules, but thought it was harsh as usually you don't settle a bill until check out. I thought common sense should have come into play.

I can't really say too much bad about this hotel, they do their best and try to sort it when things go wrong, as it did in our case. I've just listed them so you can decide. I would stay here again, based on the price, but would look elsewhere if I was looking a peaceful stay.And I would agree,they are understaffed,but what staff they have,try hard.",4,2012,11,27
249,Saturday breakfast great....Sunday breakfast disaster!,"Went to theClarion Liffey Valley for a two night break with friends.  Arrived late afternoon Friday and check in was fine.  Room was clean but cold due to a window that didn't close properly.  Contacted reception and they sent someone with an oiled filled radiator, we didn't mind where the heat came from so long as the room was warm.  We went for breakfast on Saturday morning around 9am, and we had a relaxed, leisurely breakfast....really enjoyed it, food was good and staff were attentive.  Unfortunately we were not to enjoy the same experience on Sunday morning.  We arrived for breakfast at around 9.30am and had to queue for 15/20 minutes for a table.  The dining room was untidy and the carpet was full of crumbs, My husband ordered porridge and we thought it was taking a long time to come when the lady at the table behind us returned to her table and found a bowl of porridge she hadn't ordered....it was obviously my husbands, put on the wrong table.  He asked a waitress for some sugar for his porridge and after a lengthy wait she returned with a bowl of sugar cubes, he asked another waitress for sugar but when that didn't arrived our friend went looking to see if they could find any and after a while eventually got some.  The waitress then arrived with a bowl of sugar when my husband had finished his porridge.I would totally agree with a previous review that the staffing levels were not sufficent to deal with the number of guests on Sunday morning.  I have stayed at this hotel before and returned because I had a positive experience on my last visit.  I would return again and would recommend this hotel to others but would be advising them that maybe staying on a Saturday night might not be the best idea if they want a relaxing, enjoyable breakfast on Sunday morning.",4,2012,11,26
249,"Nice hotel, but not enough staff in food/beverage areas.","Just back from a Saturday night stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley.

The hotel is located just off the M50 and sits close to the shopping mall. Check in was quick friendly and informative. 

We got a nice family room on the ground floor with double bed, single bed and a cot. Room was clean, but missing bulb for reading light on one side of bed.

Went to get something to eat about 6.30pm but the restaurant was fully booked till after 9pm. Headed into the bar instead to get some bar food.  

Got a table quick enough there, but no one was around to take a drinks or food order. Bar seemed chaotic, with not enough bar staff on duty.  Waitresses were trying to deliver food orders and pull pints at the same time.

After waiting for 15 minutes we had to ask the floor manager was anyone going to take our order? No apologies or explanations from this eastern European lady, just “where are you sitting?”

A nice Asian girl came over and was very apologetic. If the waitress had not been so polite, we would have just walked out like some other couples did. She took our order, and delivered our three year olds dinner in record time. Ours came a little later, but was unfortunately cold by the time it was delivered to us. Second time around it was much better. Chips are listed as chunky, but are regular fries. They had drawing material for kids but no crayons/colouring pencils.

We headed back to our room and looked forward to a better experience the next morning.

On the way to leisure centre just after 9am noticed this long cue of people trying to get into the restaurant.  It stretched out to the concierge desk and at first I thought it was people trying to check out.

Leisure centre was good. Nice pool and clean changing rooms. 

Went down for breakfast just after 10 am, cue was not quite so long but we still had to stand outside for 10/15 minutes to get a seat in the restaurant.  One lady working the door, was bringing guests to their tables, but rather than just doing this, was also clearing tables even though there were some vacant dressed tables inside the door. As a result the queue in the lobby just got longer and longer. 

They don’t have enough staff on the floor clearing the tables, and as a result were not turning tables as fast as they should be. Also if it’s busy for breakfast, management should consider opening the bar area for breakfast.

Checkout was quick but should guests really have to pay for parking in this day and age?, when it’s an out of town hotel. Parking should be complimentary for the first 24 hours.

Nice hotel but let down by staffing levels. Not sure I’d return or recommend.",3,2012,11,25
249,Best Hotel in West Dublin,"I have recently started staying here regularly for business purposes and have also recently had a family stay. Value for money excellent. Perfect location for a city trip. Great food in restaurants. Kids had a great time and I really believe this is the best hotel in West Dublin. Would recommend it highly to anybody. Ideal for business stays also. The staff are very friendly. I have never been disappointed. The only negative would be that it gets very busy with families in the summer but even then, they seem to make an effort to put business people in the same part of the hotel where possible. I can't fault this establishment.",5,2012,11,15
249,WOW,"stayed in the hotel for four days in a family suite which was spacious for five of our family. Livingroom has a sofa with pull out double bed and a separate double bed  with  a small piece of a kitchen in one room. Our bedroom had a double bed and you could have fitted another double bed in it.Some rooms at back of the hotel had balconies.It can be busy as you are just off the M50.Bedrooms at front facing liffey valley are quieter. Rooms are very nice. Great hotel for the food as the children can eat the rice and noodles and all the asian dishes that they like  in the asian restaurant ,while the adults can eat in the other restaurant for the european dishes if needed.Excellent location for shopping as Liffey valley shopping centre is only 5 minute walk from the hotel.Thunder road restaurant is beside the hotel and great valve while eating with children .The hotel on one evening rang out for a pizza for my children.Staff your very friendly and would recommend the hotel.",4,2012,11,12
249,Overpriced,Stayed here for two nights. Good points were the really excellent food and the location. The hotel is letdown however by unprofessional restaurant staff and poor sound proofing between the rooms and the corridor outside. You can hear clearly hear conversations in the rooms next door and outside in the hall. Overall a poor experience except for the food. ,2,2012,11,11
249,lovely stay,"stayed at the Clarian for the 4th time over the halloween holidays.  It was very busy but its a big hotel and it didnt feel overcrowded.   We had stayed in the apartments on our last 2 visits so was a bit worried about getting a room when we had a small child with us. We stayed in a family room that had a fridge which was great, and had plenty of room for him to move about in.  I found the staff very helpful and friendly, and while the rooms could do with a bit of an update they were clean and tidy and well stocked throughout our stay.  the food in the restaurant had improved greatly since our last visit and our dinner (included in our package) was very good.  Its a great hotel if you want to be out of the madness of the city but close enough to get around, we were able to visit Dundrum,Dublin Zoo and Blanchardstown all within about 20 minutes of the hotel.  Will definitely be going back!",4,2012,11,07
249,Great stay but a bit too far out,Lovely hotel..staff not massively friendly. Lovely breakfast bUt fruit salad was tinned. Bus 15 minute walk in cold and dark across motorway. Nice pool.but open to public and have to buy a swimming hat for 3 euro before you're allowed swimming. Brilliant value for money though.  ,4,2012,11,06
249,"Stunning hotel,great location and amazing food","I stayed here over nite last weekend hotel is beautiful and spotless and smells lovely, very big hotel but well managed we ordered room services and ate breakfast and lunch in this hotel the food was excellent i would defiantly stay here again",5,2012,11,06
249,Midterm Fun,"Had a great weekend here over school midterm. room spotless, staff friendly & obliging :) ideal location for a spot of retail therapy as Liffey valley shopping centre is walking distance away and Dundrum shopping centre was only 10 min drive :) hated disappointing my little girl over the kids gym though :( she saw the signs for it  Saturday night so we ambled down next morning to book her in for a session only to be told it was a private session all day and certain days the following week would be open to the public as we were leaving monday this was of no benefit to us,  no info was posted on the door at any stage, if it had been i could have explained to my daughter that it wasn't going to be an option instead of promising her a visit next morning only to have to disappoint her.",4,2012,11,05
249,Total Disappointment,"Where do i start?
Have just got home from a five day 60th birthday treat stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley from my husband. Stayed with my husband & Granddaughter and just can't understand how the hotel got it's 4* rating. Granddaughter had an accident in her bed on the first night so out of courtesy and to apologise i went to speak to the housekeeper on duty, explained what had happened and all i got from her was 'so' ... 'and' ... 'my English not good don't understand you' at which point i thought she would got to get a superior who could understand me but she just stood there with a blank expression! Did not want to embarrass my Granddaughter so i just let it ride. OUR BED LINEN WAS NOT CHANGED FOR THE ENTIRE 5 DAYS!!!! There was just 2 of everything in the room i.e. bath towels, hand towels, glasses and cups so had to ask for more, surely they inform housekeeping how many guests are in each room! Room was very 'tired' .... broken lamps and shades (no central lighting), broken electricity socket (taped), huge stain on the carpet which had been covered with a table, no hairdryer but this is included in the room itinery on the website, room needed a good clean as there was dust everywhere. There was a tiny wardrobe(no doors) and no drawers (just a couple that were about 2 inches deep!). Toilet paper and shampoo had run-out on day 2 so had to go to reception to request more (surely this should be checked every day by housekeeping but they never changed our bed linen all week so we should not have expected them to do that simple task. Long queues every morning for breakfast so gave up and drove out to eat!
The only thing that compensated for the poor quality of the hotel was that the people of Dublin were so friendly and helpful (outside of the hotel). Sorry but i just can't recommend this hotel!",1,2012,11,03
249,very nice staff,"I have recently stayed at the clarion with my husband and i was surprised to be so nicely greeted with a big smile,by a member of staff called Sarah, she was very efficient and professional even though there was a bit if a queue we were in no way rushed, she done everything in her power to make our stay as enjoyable and pleasant as possible. the room was spotless and also had a nice balcony,and i had a very good sleep. although breakfast wasn't as efficient as check in there was still plenty of choice with buffet, after breakfast i enjoyed a dip in the pool and relaxed in the steam room and sauna.",4,2012,11,03
249,"""WORST EVER"" customer service!!","My boyfriend was unfortunately stranded in Dublin on Halloween night due to car trouble. As he was working in the Liffey Valley area, I decided to phone the hotel, as it was the closet, to see if there were any rooms available (at approx 9.30pm). The receptionist said yes, just come down. I rang my boyfriend to tell him this. When he was at check-in, he rang me and I was speaking to the receptionist (I didn't get her name, she spoke with a foreign accent) and I was giving her my credit card number to pay for the reservation. She told me no, this would not work and that I had to go on the website to make the reservation! So, there was my boyfriend standing at reception in hotel, me on the phone with a credit card number to pay for the room but yet I had to go to the website to make reservation! I have never ever heard anything like it! I have stayed at many hotels in Ireland and always book over the phone giving credit card number. I do online shopping and always pay with credit card! The Clarion is a joke! Obviously, they don't want the business that much! I emailed the hotel yesterday morning (Thursday) at 9.25am to ask for email address for the manager and as of 4.20pm this afternoon (Friday) I have not yet received a reply from them! Very bad customer service! They need to send their staff on a better training course - or why do they need reception staff when they tell people to book on website! My boyfriend also said the hotel is not even nice!",1,2012,11,02
249,Very Disappointing,"This Hotel looks appealing outside and inside.  Rooms are pleasantly dressed, but very basic.  Still using big old TV's!! Very old pillows (Thread bear in fact) with pillowcases that are too tight!  Only one very flat hard pillow per person.  The bed was rock hard and neither of us slept well at all!  I suffer from fibromyalgia and my husband suffers from Arthritis and has had a hip replacement done.  We were both in so much pain we asked if we could have an upgrade but they informed us the beds were the same throughout the Hotel apart from their size.  We were so disappointed as this had been a treat for my husband for his birthday.
My husband & I went for a quiet weekend to be confronted with masses of people, their kids and noise levels that were unreal.  We had to queue both mornings (before 9 am) to get our breakfast.  There was a reasonable choice available for breakfast but the hot food on both occasions was really cold, and the service was very poor.
We had a meal on the first night of our stay, but again the food was extremely poor and so was the service.  The choice was really bad and I was not able to eat any of my main course at all.  The chicken was over cooked, the two carrots were undercooked and could have been used as darts!! The sauce and mash were disgusting.  The waitress saw I hadn't touched my meal and never even made comment!! It took us over two hours to get fed and we still came out hungry.",2,2012,11,02
249,nice hotel,i had the pleasure of a night here whilst working in Dublin. i could find no fault in the hotel. The rooms are great the bar is good and the staff  were really helpful.  i did not use the restaurants onsite so can't comment on the food but my colleagues have told me that this is of a high standard also.,5,2012,11,02
249,Stay in the City!!,"Hotel is very clean, staff are very helpful BUT.....
There are huge queues if you want breakfast after 8-30
It is difficult to get to and from the airport and city centre (airport hopper from airport is every 2 hours - 12 euro's) There is a bus every 10 minutes from the Shopping Centre, but takes up to 45 minutes at rush hour and ONLY takes exact money in COINS!!! Plus you have to walk back along a very dark busy road unless you have a very kind bus driver who drops you off outside.
Food in the bar is lovely and service is pretty quick. Drinks are VERY EXPENSIVE.
The beds are VERY hard too.
Pool area, jacuzzi etc is basic, but clean and well staffed. Take a swimming cap, as you can't swim without one and they charge 3 euros each. 
Two nights was only £80 so can't complain.
Next time I'd stay in the City Centre!!",3,2012,11,01
249,Great value,"This was our third occassion staying in this hotel. This time we had a suite which was fab, great to have a fridge for drinks etc. hotel staff are pleasant and while the hotel was very busy tables were cleared quickly at breakfast time and queue moved along quickly. Hotel is just off the m50 close to the city by car or you could go to luas park and ride at the red cow to avoid traffic. Right next to Liffey valley shopping centre which has the largest m and s in Ireland :) only gripe is you have to pay for parking at this hotel. Can't see how the justify this given hotel is outside the city. Would def return. ",4,2012,11,01
249,Good value but wouldn't go back,"Went here for a family break with our three year old son. Got great value with dinner included on one of the nights. The room itself was fine. A normal decent modern hotel room without being anything special. Perfectly adequate. 
We were told on checkin to book our dinner reservation for the following night. However when we turned up at 7pm (along with a few other guests) the following night for our dinner reservation we were told that there were no tables as they had just had a group of 100 people who had arrived. We were told that we had to come back two hours later at 9pm. This was not an option with a young child! We had to eat in the bar which was dirty, overcrowded and noisy. Admittedly the food in the bar was included in our rate as our dinner. However it seems to me that when the hotel saw 100 people arriving for dinner they decided to ditch the residents like us who had a meal included in their room rate. Left a very bad taste in the mouth and felt like being treated like second class citizens. We won't be back. I'd rather go somewhere where my business is appreciated!
On the up side, the pool area was really nice and the staff there were top class.",3,2012,10,30
249,Excellent value,"We had a lovely 2 night break, and we were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to a suite on arrival. Excellent all round.",5,2012,10,29
249,Nice hotel for a shopping trip.,"Stayed here for the october bank holiday for two nights when we checked in they put us up in the the serviced apartments which were beautiful with fitted kitchen etc was immaculate and really cheered us up, the hotel is a five minute walk to the liffey valley shopping centre which has a huge variety of shops the hotel has also a health centre not much bad I can say about this hotel also has a airport shuttle with park and ride car park is four euros a day would definetely recommend this hotel.",5,2012,10,29
249,"Very reasonably priced family room, but not family friendly on Saturday nights!!!","Stayed here on a Saturday night with my husband and our 2 year old, handy location with reasonably priced room & parking. 

Car park - very tight squeeze - not for the inexperienced Parker! But only €4 overnight. 

Lobby - noisy with constant people traffic. Didn't locate any quiet space in this hotel.

Bar & Restaurant - busy, loud and packed! Constant stream of hen party attendees parading around lobby and corridors on their way out. 

Room - warm and uncomfortable, no air conditioning, noisy fan available, grubby carpet and cracked bathroom tiles, clean comfortable bedding and nice decor. Good selection of TV channels. Very noisy at night, outside revellers until 3-4am exiting a function at the hotel, inside noisy folk returning to their rooms disturbed us most of the night. Room 318 had the noisiest flush on a toilet possible, it sounded like a jet engine taking off each time we used it. Next door was the same meaning we heard their noise each time too! 

Breakfast - even at 8.30am the dining room was packed, very poor service from the staff on duty, a scrum for cereals and juice, only one toaster for entire restaurant , asked for poached egg on toast and was waiting 30mins to be served two eggs slopping around my plate in water - no toast - poor presentation. Cooked breakfast was dry.

This hotel is ideal for those wanting to party late & have a good base, not ideal for families at weekends. I wouldn't go back again. ",4,2012,10,29
249,Convenient to airport,"The Clarion is in need of a makeover.  I was put in what I would call a basement room and had to cope with luggage down 2 flights of stairs.  The mini bar was empty, the TV was antiquated and overall the decor was mid 50's.  I flew in late from Amsterdam and had to walk to the hotel as it was too late for shuttle service.  The only reason I booked this hotel was because it was just around the corner from the airport and I had an early flight to the US.  It did serve it's purpose of supplying a clean room and decent bed.",2,2012,10,25
249,poor check in; later off set by really nice staff.  Would stay again,"We booked adjoining rooms for two nights.  I phoned three times in advance to confirm, because we were going to be late arrival.  On arrival at 10.30 they had the note for adjoining rooms on the reservation but had only reserved one room.  Busy friday night so it took some time to find rooms near one another but had no adjoining. A bit of a pain as had three small children. Next morning on phoning down they could still not provide adjoining rooms.  However when we went to reception they were able to sort the problem.  
On our return from our day out we went to the Kudos bar for Aisian cuisine.  Very tired children and parents.  Found the service here great and the food quite good.  The wonderful waitress realised the situation and took control, virtually ordering our food for us and having it on the table in minutes.  Would stay again.  It was very good value overall.",3,2012,10,24
249,Not a 4 star hotel !!,"Disappointed there was no wi fi in the rooms only in the lobby. There was alot of noise from the busy road nearby.  No air conditioning in the room, only a fan !! The mini bar, was empty. The food in the hotel, Kudos ""Asian Cuisine"" very disappointing. You will be charged for parking.  Wont be back !!",3,2012,10,23
249,great stay,"Got free upgrade to suite from very nice receptionist on arrival when I requested balcony room.  Great staff, great breakfast  stayed extra  night as facilities and room were so good. Great Value for family rooms. Good location for anyone travelling from South.",4,2012,10,22
249,DISAPPOINTING,"Booked a 2 bedroom apartment in this hotel on recommendation of a family member who had previously stayed here.  As a family of 5 (2 adults, 2 kids, 1 infant) it seemed to fit our requirements perfectly - 2 bedrooms, playground, leisure centre, chld friendly etc
However from arrival things didnt meet our expectations.
We arrived early (12.30pm) and enquired if we could check in. Told room was not yet ready and would be another 40mins - no problem - went and had lunch in bar area which was very nice.
When we returned approx 1 hr later room not ready and greeted with an outrageous comment from the receptionist: 'typical family wanting to check in early and always last to leave'
After a visit to the playground and another hour went to check in again. Thankfully our previous friendly receptionist was not to be seen.
When checking in for our 2 bed apartment we were told that there was not one available and they could put us in adjoining 1 bed apartments. Not happy with this as a two bed unit is what we booked months previously to suit our requirements - primarily the reason for chosing this location.
Not at all happy to leave our young children in a bedroom in a separate apartment adjoining ours - this didnt seem to register. Were being told we would have more room and space etc We were having none of it - when my wife called me over to the reception to try snd sort out the issue I had to stress our concerns a number of times before the receptionist would consider a move. Once I had arrived the receptionist listened to what I had to say and disappeared for about 5 mins. Low and behold when he returned I had my 2 bed apartment. Hard to understand why this wasnt the case initially and even after my wife complained - it took the presence of a man to get them to correct the booking - quite amazing really.
The apartment itself was fine - a little bit tired and shabby inplaces but all in all fine. One gripe was the air con doesnt work. Weather was quite hot at the time and with all the glass the room gets very hot. A number fo fans were in the apartment - when we quizzed about the air con we were told it just doesnt work and has not done so!! (advertised as air con apartments)
Our stay was pleasent and going fine. Very good take away dinner options in Lemongrass restaurant across the road (highlight of stay)
All untill our final night, Saturday.
After kids were all down to sleep, we had our dinner and relaxed in front tof the TV (some channels not working) before going to bed. There was some noise coming from across the road where there is a public bar - thought thats fine will stop after closing 12.30 ish - most definatley not the case - got louder and louder - sounded like a night club and didnt stip till well after 3am. Not a wink of sleep. Not great when the youngest infant gets up at 5.30 -6 am. Serious loud music, shouting, roaring etc etc all night.
A very disappointing end to our family break away.
Anyone booking apartments here make sure they do not face the bar/Lemongrass restaurant as you will not sleep

I do not tend to give poor reviews but in this case I was so angry leaving that I feet it warranted it. We are in our mid 30's and are up for the craic as much as anyone but in this case it was far too much. Not cheap to book a family apartment for 3 nights, food, drinks etc etc and most definately feel the value for money was poor in this case.",2,2012,10,12
249,Spot on.,Very clean rooms. Good facilities ..rooms and gym. Good customer service and nice staff Location not ideal if planning on going out in city centre. Close to shopping centre and good parkjng. Overall an enjoyable good stay,4,2012,10,10
249,Good value near Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for the weekend of the last Leonard Cohen concert in Dublin in mid september. We picked it based on the price and the fact that coming from he west of Ireland it was convenient to get to and we had no intention of going into the city centre until the concert on saturday evening. Arriving on Friday evening we ate at the very nice Thai restaurant across the road, Lemongrass had a drink in the unatmospheric bar and off to bed. Very nice breakfast the next morning which we were wrongly told finished at half ten by a grumpy male receptionist. In fact it was 11am which is much better on a Saturday morning. Headed over to Liffey valley in early afternoon and drove into the concert that evening and back to hotel that night. We had a fine breakfast (the pudding was awful though) on Sunday morning and then drove home.

The reason why I have detailed this is because I feel this is how best to use this hotel. It is on the outskirts of Dublin and best to arrive to for convenience with the intention of going into the city centre on Saturday and back to hotel that night ideally in your own car as a taxi would  be costly. As others have said is convenient also for the airport. 

However,there were irritating downsides. Pay parking is annoying, the machine can't  read notes, there was a lot of noise outside the hotel on the friday night which interrupted our sleep and the rooms were uncomfortably warm. I am not sure is the noise a regular problem based on revellers coming home late but it wasn't bad on he Saturday night. (A tradesman's van had a window broken on he Friday night in what looked like an attempt to steal tools so best to park underground).

The male receptionist who ""greeted"" washed the personality of a newt and really looked liked he hated his job which was disappointing but the barman was friendly. The female receptionist who bid us farewell was very pleasant though and helpful.

We didn't use the pool and were not bothered by children or other guests or the bedroom.

This is a down to earth hotel with a down to earth crowd looking for somewhere cheap near Dublin or a shopping break in Liffey valley.

I would stay here again based on the low price but if any dearer I would choose elsewhere. It is best for people coming from the west of Ireland for convenience as a launching pad to the city centre.

I feel we used the hotel's assets wisely and had a pleasant time. 

I would stay again on the basis that the Friday night interruptions were unusual and have docked a star for this reason and the unpleasant receptionist.",3,2012,10,07
249,Comfortable rooms but very noisy rowdy guests!,"I stayed here recently and at first I was impressed as its clean and comfortable, but I was woken during the night by loud shouting and singing   This carried on throughout the night and a couple in the next room screamed and laughed all night - I will NEVER return.",1,2012,10,05
249,Definitely wont be back,"Myself, daughter and 2 grandchildren came to this hotel for a relaxing break, we where sorely disappointed with the service we received from the restaurant, firstly the time frame for the meal, we arrived at 8.30pm and where finishing up at 10.10pm. We complained about one of the mains, the steak was inedible and we where that long waiting my daughter had to go to the room with her young baby, she had to get a second main which was delivered to the room around 10pm, this is ridiculous service! If that wasn't enough we were rudely awakened by reception ringing, this woke the 2children, who we couldn't get back to sleep, this query was regarding a bar bill which we didn't run up. The breakfast the next morning was ok. The best part of the break was leaving this hotel. I have recommended this hotel to ALOT of ppl after a previous stay in August, so u can imagine my disgust in receiving a half hearted apology the next morning and especially not being compensated for the inconvenience.",1,2012,10,04
249,Decent hotel,"I cannot understand people's negativity about this hotel. It is a reasonably priced, clean hotel that's convenient for the airport and located about twenty minutes car drive from central Dublin. The rooms were a decent size, the linen and towels were fresh, the shower powerful, and the staff extremely friendly. It is what it says on the website! No surprises!",4,2012,10,04
249,Like staying at a truck stop,"we stayed here because of the good reviews and perceived proximity to the airport. However it was actually difficult to negotiate the freeway on ramps and off ramps as it's at the intersection of two major roads. It's a dumpy tourist hotel serving bus loads of people with name tags and tour leaders. 

Do you really want your first or last impression of a lovely country to be this generic place overlooking a car park?

There is no public transportation anywhere near here, no restaurants, no atmosphere. Not a walkable area.

",2,2012,09,28
249,its handy for matches/shopping,"i use this for going matches and get  a shopping trip in, though liffey valley centre hasnt everything its got alot, but the hotel, is close to walk over, and great facilities, 
only the last time used the leisure centre, and its lovely pool great. ate in restaurant - very nice meal. 
only problem was the room was so hot, we had a fan on the whole night, maybe thats a good thing, but really it was very hot, and you cant open windows only an inch. maybe a good complaint.",4,2012,09,27
249,3 star experience,"Stayed at the hotel on a family break during August. The hotel was exceptionally busy and the majority of guests appeared to be on a family break. While reception staff were very efficient, there was still a wait of approx 20 mins to get to the check in desk. The room was basic but sufficient, however the temperatures in the bedrooms were ridiculously warm!! We were located on the top floor and eventhough we slept with the bedroom window open and room fan on full speed, it was very difficult to sleep as the temperature in the room was so high.. Breakfast was basic and very busy, queues at peak times. Ideally located for a visit to Tayto park, approx 20 mins drive.",3,2012,09,24
249,Good service,Excellent reception staff. Patient and willing to answer any and all my questions. All the standard facilities. My shower curtain is so creased and screwed tho. Perhaps this is the style. If so its awful. But thats just my opinion :) ,4,2012,09,18
249,Decent,"This is a nice hotel and the room was very clean which is a major bonus these days! However, when I arrived, I was very annoyed to be left waiting for 15 minutes to check-in as I needed to be someplace. The food was decent. I used room service for dinner and breakfast. Both times, they forgot something but otherwise it was decent. I found the porter and the room service attendant very friendly but not the front desk. My room was very cool when I returned and after trying to figure out the heat, I was told that the heat was off in the entire hotel (it was 7 degrees outside) and they brought me a small electric heater which took a significant amount of time to heat the room. The bed had a dip in it so it was extremely uncomfortable and, although I would've told the front desk this info had they asked at checkout, they didn't ask anything about how my stay was! However, due to the cleanliness of the rooms and the food being quite decent, I would chance it again and would change rooms if I got another bed like that!",3,2012,09,17
249,Maybe a 3 star hotel instead of 4 star?,"Took my boyfriend away for his birthday to dublin and chose to stay in this hotel because it looked really good and reviews were mixed so thought I would give it a go! First of all you have to pay 4 euro for the car park if u are there for over 4 hours in a day. It is really hard to get a space in the car park outside the hotel as people are coming and going all the time to use the gym and swimming pool. You are better using secure underground parking. The room we were first put in was ok but it was on ground floor, felt like we were in a dungeon. We asked to change rooms which was no problem, this was a much better room looking over the car park. The staff in the hotel arnt great.The nicest staff we came across were in the breakfast hall. The swimming pool is used as the local leisure centre as it is 1 euro a day for people to use, so kids are everywhere and a good bit of the pool is closed off for swimming lanes. Lockers are 2 euro to rent. You are better going to the pool early in the morning. Breakfast served was ok, could of had more hot food but was ok. Location is out of the city but if you have a car, you will be ok. The liffey Valley shopping centre is very close by and is really good. Has loads of shops in it. The restaurant across the road called the Arc Cafe is lovely and serves food until 10 at night. I would stay here again but only if i was at a concert in dublin, not for a relaxing break with the boyfriend. Definatley not 4 star anyway.",3,2012,09,16
249,Would never return.,"This hotel is close to the airport, and that's where ANY positive feedback ends. The hotel is a behemoth, and it was a labyrinthine trek to find our room. We were greeted by a large bag of garbage in the hallway next to our door, along with a broken child's play pen. While we waited - at least 25 minutes - for our meal to arrive in the lobby restaurant (restaurant staff were curt), I stood in line at reception - at least 20 minutes - to report the trash outside our door. The receptionist was mildly interested, and after dinner, guess what? Yep, all trash was still there. I'm the one who moved it into a nearby common area. It seems that because the facility is gigantic, management tries to pull in families with children for overnight get-aways. Each time we walked through, the lobby area was swarming with apparently unsupervised children, careening here and there. (I DO like children - just not when they behave like that - and in public!) Our toilet did not reliably flush, and there IS a trick to getting the electric on in your room. And this ""great"" stay ended predictably: when checking out in the morning, we paid for the overnight parking. (Yes, you pay to park overnight in their lot.) Reception gave us all small denomination Euro coins - they ""had nothing bigger."" So we returned to the States with a pocket full on small change. It was our final, annoying ""gift"" from this dismal stay. What a sorry way to end a wonderful trip in Ireland.",1,2012,09,16
249,Bed & Breakfast,"I stayed there with my daughter on 19 and 20 July. A very nice hotel with good food, service and accommodation . The only disadvantage was if was a long way from city centre and we had to get taxis. It was very near the Liffey valley shopping centre, a good centre to do all your shopping under one roof. There was also a cinema.",5,2012,09,14
249,absolutly terrible,stayed here for one night and have to say the staff where unbelievably rude never seen anything like it... the paint in the room was flakin off the walls the bins hadn been changed in the bathroom the lifts wasnt working when i rang to complain they didnt care i had to pay deposit on the room which they left me waitin for the next morning for like and hour to get it back.. the restaurant in the hotel closed..!! absolutly disgusted with the place!,1,2012,09,14
249,"""No AC in any rooms"" (???)","We stayed here for 2 nights with our infant.  They did provide a crib (cot) for the baby.  When we arrived the room was hot and we were told that NO rooms have AC; the previous reviewer said they had AC, so that is confusing.  The sink leaked and water got all over the floor; it was fixed the next day after I complained.  There was not enough soap in the dispenser in the shower, so that ran out the first morning.  We were not told that breakfast was included with our stay so we almost missed it, if we had not happened to ask on our way out.  Parking is 4 Euro/night; the front desk told us to ""pay for parking on the way out""; we had assumed this meant pay at the gate when you leave, but it actually meant pay inside the hotel before you leave.  So we had to turn the car around and return to the hotel to pay for parking.  We were overcharged (incorrectly charged) when we checked out, and we had to have them fix it.  I cannot say we would stay here again.",2,2012,09,10
249,Hot in the city,"We stayed here for two nights in August. We booked two rooms through hotels.com because it worked out a lot cheaper. Thankfully one of our rooms was upgraded to a lovely two bedroomed suite with a mini kitchen and air conditioning.....just as well because the standard room was so hot it really was unbearable.
The suite had a balcony which looked over the M50....and there were bags of dirty nappies left there.
The queue for breakfast each morning was mad, especially when you get in to the dining room and see lots of empty larger tables...but they seem to only want to put 4 people on a four seated table. 
The parking charge is annoying as well.
It's handy for the Liffey Valley Shopping centre but apart from that not much else. I wouldn't stay here again.",3,2012,09,08
249,Good value stopover hotel,"Stayed here one night in August as a couple on a stopover whilst our kids stayed with relatives and had a perfectly pleasant stay.

It's easy to get to and find (especially by car, public transport might be a problem), the staff and service I would describe as efficient rather than friendly, the facilites like the pool etc are very good and the rooms are also mostly pretty good too - the bed in our room felt a bit lop-sided but it wasn't uncomfortable and the best thing about the room was complete blacout curtains.  Our room was on the ground floor facing the car-park but there was no noise  There was a good-sized flat screen TV with a decent range of free channels.

Overall: You can have a good night's sleep at a good price here - those are the fundamental basics of being a decent hotel.  Anything else is a bonus and the decent pool is a big bonus at the Clarion.",4,2012,09,07
249,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"I stayed at this hotel for a number of weeks whilst on business in Dublin. The hotel is very modern with clean spacious rooms, all of which have free wifi. There is a bar which serves food all day and a restaurant serving breakfast and dinner, the food from both are very good and offer good value for money. Guests can also avail of use of the Sanovitae fitness centre adjacent to the hotel. It has a well stocked gym and pool, sauna and steam room. 
Also secure underground parking is provided free of charge to guests.

It is in an ideal location with Liffey Valley shopping centre right on the door step and easy access to the city centre and Dublin airport (both only about 20 minutes drive away)",4,2012,09,04
249,"A reasonably comfortable, oversized hotel with inadequate facilities and endless corridors","This is a reasonably comfortable, oversized hotel with inadequate facilities, endless corridors and a modern design, which could well have its roots in the Soviet era. The restaurant and other facilities are too small and the hotel is characterless and could be classed as a warehouse for storing people in transit. The numerous corridors are nicely decorated in identical, neutral colours, but are feature-less, whilst the signage is misleading and inadequate and so it is easy to get lost. 

The hotel has evidently been extended, possibly several times, with poor planning and a lack foresight. Where the blocks join there is a sudden, short and uncomfortable change in the floor level and the resulting unexpected slope is a severe hazard to small children and anyone unsteady on their feet. Another outcome is that one set of lifts does not reach the top floors and the set that does is a long way from Reception. 

The rooms do not have air conditioning and first one we were offered was on the Ground Floor. It was very hot and stuffy and, as it was next to the motorway, the traffic noise meant that the window had to be kept closed.  I requested a change and the very pleasant receptionist gave us a room on the fourth floor, which was adequate and clean, with a comfortable bed, effective blackout curtains and a fast broadband connection, but no Wi-Fi.  

This room was also designed for people with a disability. Common sense would suggest that such rooms should be as near the hotel entrance as possible, yet this one was at the furthest extremity of the complex and served by only one of the two sets of lifts!

The Reception area and Lobby are too small and at busy times they present a bottle-neck. When we checked in, reception area was filled by a very large group of motorcyclists, who were arguing (vociferously and not unreasonably, but apparently without success) that the €4 car park charge should be halved as they could put two or more bikes in a parking bay! 

The food in the restaurant was good and the service was excellent, as it was in Reception. The hotel management are obviously aware of the hotel’s inadequacies and have introduced what they call a “traffic light system” to regulate the flow of guests at breakfast.  

If I had to, I would stay again at the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley, but only because of its location and the friendly and helpful attitude of the staff, who are making the best of an oversized and badly designed building.",2,2012,08,30
249,great hotel but so hot!,"only stopped the one night  arrived mid evening,great looking hotel fairly modern!,, great reception from the desk,, a quick check in! found our room,,and it was super!  but hot! no aircon, no fan, ended up having to get up in the middle of the night to go downstair for a walk to cool down! please add fans at least to the rooms!
 cant remember the place next door to this hotel but we popped into there for some food,,excellent plateful all cooked well! resonably priced!
 very easy access to motorways and shopping centre! would we stay again??? deffinatly,,if its jan/feb time!",3,2012,08,29
249,Great base and family hotel,"Stayed there as a base to do a few things around Dublin. It's right off the M50 so it is easy to get to either side of the city, which is what I needed. 

The kids enjoyed the pool but having to travel through a very busy reception each morning with over excited kids is a bit of a design flaw. I know there is nothing the hotel can do about that now. 

There was a very large group of american students there at the time and I must say the staff managed the crowd very well, especially at breakfast. 

Only down point was, for a family room, it is very small.",4,2012,08,28
249,Very Iffy Liffey,"Firstly if you are on a weekend break in Dublin, do not consider this hotel as it is out of town and Taxi's are hard to get hold of, although hotels are more expensive in the city, they are worth every penny of convenience. I was in town for a wedding in Chapel Izod and the hotel room was there to sleep in. The service at reception was appalling and there were queues in all directions at 2pm on a Friday afternoon. No apologies for waiting however it seemed that they did not care anyway.
The room I had sided onto the motorway, which with the door open was like being on the M25, I have just read a review that says it is a lovely hotel with a lot to do, If your idea of shopping till you drop, having a swim and going to the hotel restaurant for a meal is your thing, then it is ideal. I will not be recommending this hotel to my friends.",3,2012,08,28
249,Big new-ish hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for the weekend, value for money we were pretty impressed. It is close to the shopping centre and only about 20min drive to Dublin centre.

Good points:
-very clean rooms and bathrooms by the cleaners each day
-modern rooms, tv had internet access but you do have to pay
-internet cables are provided in the room if you take a laptop so you can use the net for free
-good shower in the bathroom it really is like a drencher!
-Free use of swimming pool
-quiet hotel considering the size and location as was on the M50 road.

Bad points:
-our room card stopped working and when we asked reception to fix it, all she did was ask for our room number, scan it and give it back. Considering that was the first time she had met us, I'm pretty sure we could have given a different room number and had access to someone else's room which therefore didnt seem very secure
-Swimming pool was very small and hat to wear swimming hats
-Parking was €4 euros per day but I felt we shouldnt have to pay this as hotel guests.
-although we ate breakfast over the road, we noticed there to always be a queue for breakfast
-reception was always busy sometimes we had to queue for 15mins which is too long if you want something done which is reasonably quick, the staff seemed to be overworked on reception to be honest.",4,2012,08,28
249,FAB HOTEL ALL ROUND :),"stayed ere recently with few friends, one of the nicest hotels i have seen :) :) spotless, friendly helpful staff, children friendly, shopping nearby sure its everything ya could want :) no complaints what so ever (skipepd brekkie so cant comment on that) the only fault i would think is the dangerous stairs in the reception area, would be easy fall down :O ...........lovely place tho highly recommend it :)) defo be back ... very impressed with the music supplied on the tv :))",5,2012,08,26
249,Will stay again.,"We (2 adults & 2 children 2& 4) have stayed in this hotel on at least 4 occasions we have always enjoyed our stay. We stayed the last time on the 13th & 14th of August we booked through super value breaks so paid E37.50 per adult per night B&B , when we arrived we had a 1 bed apartment with the couch made into a bed which we were delighted with as the girls had loads of room to play.

We used the pool which is lovely small bit on the cold side but the girls enjoyed it once they got used to it.

Breakfast was good lots of choice to chose from but you should definitely take note of the traffic light system they have in place as it does get very busy after 9.30. We only ate breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on other meals in the hotel.

The hotel offers kids movie night every night in the hotel & have a lovely playground as well the Liffey Valley shopping center is a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

We enjoyed our stay & will stay again, parking is E4.",4,2012,08,25
249,Very good hotel,"Lovely hotel, lots to do.  The leisure facilities are very good all free to hotel guests.  Staff excellent very helpful.  In a good position next to Liffey Valley shopping Centre which incorporates a fourteen screen cinema complex.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a very relaxing break.  Breakfast excellent.   Although we didn't have children with us it had numerous facilities for children. Hotel restaurant had different deals on each night.",5,2012,08,25
249,Good  Value hotel,"We stayed in clarion liffey valley last sat nite.80 euro b&b. Nice rooms,nice pool and Sauna.
Parking was 4 euro.We availed of a 20 euro deal for a 2 course meal and Cinema tickets.Meal was really nice, Chinese type food, staff very nice.Beware though the movie you go to see
must be out at least two weeks.we were lucky as we went to see Ted(great crack) and this was out two weeks.First we heard of this clause was booking tickets in the cinema.A bit sneaky as this is not clearly stated.But is a great deal. 5 min walk to the cinema.Popcorn n drinks expensive!!!Overall a very nice stay.Brekkie if you can get the deal is very nice.",4,2012,08,24
249,Not one of the best hotels I have stayed in by a long shot,"Stayed at Room 413 in  8th August 2012. 

Room and Corridors of the hotel uncomfortably Hot! - dont think the room had any cool air conditioning, only a couple of fans that pushed the hot air around and a small window that didnt open fully (presumably to stop kids falling out) but in this room the window was broken and wouldnt shut full either! 

Have to pay for car parking even though the car park is attached to the hotel and even if you are booked as a guest!! 

long queue for Breakfast at their busiest time (around 9.30am) and that to even just get a table! 

Cutlery was dirty and 'sticky' orange juice was warm (rather the orange juice was refridgerated but you have to put it in glasses just out of hot dishwasher) toaster took ages to toast a bit of bread and even then it comes out as just warm bread, not toast, have to ask especially for fried egg or boiled egg (only have scrambled already done) , cube sugar in open bowl on table you dont know who's handled it or coughed or sneezed over it! 

No WiFi internet in room but there was an ethernet LAN socket if you wanted to plug your own laptop in for the Internet, dear internet if you wanted to look at the internet through their TV, Dont appear to be any music channels on the TV not even 1 music channel.

Sheets, pillows and towels smell of Stale Smoke - not a good effect if you are a non-smoker. 

Shower was not working properly in room, scalding hot one minute and cold the next could not get temperature right, plug in bath and plug in basin leaked so couldnt have a bath without water escaping and could fill up basin. 

Room was clean though and was serviced with most amenities including kettle iron hairdryer and also had a lockable safe in the cupboard.",3,2012,08,23
249,This hotel is adaquate.,"We arrived at this hotel after a late flight, we parked and checked in. My husband asked was there somewhere we could get something to eat, as it was after midnight we were offered sandwiches, this was fine but we decided against it.  We got some water from a vending machine and went to bed. The rooms aren't very soundproof as we heard a baby crying in a room above us, and a couple fighting in another room.  
The room was clean and the beds very comfortable. However an oversight with housekeeping ment we had no kettle to make a cup of coffee, and by the time it arrived it was time for us to leave.  We were dissapointed to discover we were charged for parking, this is unusual for guests in Dublin hotels.",4,2012,08,23
249,Never again,Booked in for 5 nite family break..only stayed 3 and went home..rooms r like a furnace wit no aircon.a complete joke wit 2 young kids..overall disappointed and wont go back again..hav to pay for parking aswell..a total rip off...,3,2012,08,23
249,Top Marks,"I booked last minute and arrived to reception with 2 friends who had booked through needahotel.com to be met by Rana who was professional and very helpful.  I explained that I had paid separate to my friends and asked where my room was and he said the basement.  I asked if there was any other room available other than the basement and he said hold on and I'll see and with no fuss upgraded me and my friends to two separate apartments. This really made our night away very special.  I was going home the following day and my friends were going to the Horse Show - they were very busy but very helpful and very easy to deal with.  I hadn't booked breakfast and hadn't paid but again there was no fuss and Jiago said it was no problem to have breakfast and go to reception and pay afterwards and when leaving I paid and dealt with another pleasant and professional receptionist, Jana.  Most of the staff were not Irish but certainly had gave us an Irish welcome.  We had a few drinks at the bar and yet another non-national looked after us there and made some really nice cocktails but the only Irish person we dealt with was behind the bar called Niall (could have been in charge but don't know) and didn't take kindly to a request for a free drink - a bit of humour is an Irish trait and a bit of banter with the customer is surely part of the job.  The media often say that non-nationals are taking Irish jobs  especially in the hospitality business - well maybe they are doing a better job - are more pleasant and professional.  I highly recommend this hotel and congratulate the staff in reception, bar and restaurant for giving us a very pleasant experience.",5,2012,08,21
249,Lovely hotel,"Real nice hotel, lovely rooms and friendly service. Good pool too and breakfast top class. Only negative is it ia a bit far from the centre.Also very near the Liffey Valley shopping centre. We ate in the restaurant and that was good too.",5,2012,08,21
249,Good and bad,"The good first
The evening meal was excellent.  We had a dinner and B&B deal and the dinner on the first night was really excellent.  The food on the second night was very good, but not as good for some reason.  We ate in the main dining room; there was also food available in the bar.  The meals were really very reasonably priced.  

The bad
The room was facing a motorway, very hot, not air conditioned and the window opened a crack.  “Hot” is usually not an issue in Ireland, but it was this time and with the window open its maximum one inch, it was bearable but noisy, with the window closed it was marginally less noisy.  There was a fan supplied to move the hot air around.  

The solution
We politely enquired about moving room before breakfast, we were politely fobbed off  with the hotel is full excuse; we were a bit more begging after breakfast and were still politely fobbed off, we were quite direct later that day and were politely turned down.  Finally “Move us to a cooler and quieter room or we are checking out” worked a treat.  

Top tip
Ask for a room not facing the motorway at reservation and as the hotel probably has a stream of room relocation requests, get yours in early and very firmly.  

After all that, this hotel is good value, well located for access to Dublin (by car), it is just off the orbital ring motorway (M50) and adjacent to the main motorway West (M4/M6). Perhaps 20 minutes from the Airport.   It is beside a very large shopping centre.",3,2012,08,20
249,a grand family hotel,"A decent enough hotel for families but no airconditioning was a bit of a nightmare, good location for travelling about from. Did ask the concierge a couple of questions and then a couple more just to take the p*** because i might as well have my 7 year old, totally useless and to make mattrers worse he was local... a foreign member of staff could be forgiven for maybe not knowing. He couldnt even tell us where the nearest petrol station was....it was actually about 500m past the exit you would use to come off to go to the hotel.... Secure under ground parking... kids enjoyed the pool but chemical levels were through the roof, chaging rooms were tired and dont forget the 4 euros for a swim hat and 2 euros to hire a lock for the locker... life gaurding at times was a little ropey... back to the hotel, good free wifi in and around hotel reception considering the amount of people accessing it , hotel bar was grand and staff pleasant, kids enjoyed the nightly DVD's all in all nothing special but a good base for families and groups...",4,2012,08,20
249,Apartments,"Stayed in one of the apartments with the kids and it was great. Clean, well maintained. Had stayed in this hotel before in one of the normal bedrooms and there was a smell in it of mould. The apartments were definately worth it especially with the kids. All I had to do was buy milk and a box of cereal! Would stay in apartments again.",4,2012,08,20
249,It was ok,"Stayed for one night as part of a hen night group. Room was nice, did the job. Television didnt work, did work, didnt work.  After our night out a group of us decided to go back tot he hotel to the residents bar to end our night with a drink or 2 but when we got back it was closed, a rude man at the door said tough look, there was even a bride there trying to get a drink but he said no, felt a bit sorry for heer and her party. At breakfast the following morning, the head guy there followed us around like we were naughty children. Checkout took ages with the long queues and only 1 receptionist working,",3,2012,08,19
249,Needs a bit of updating,"Stayed recently but only for it's location,wont be rushing back.
The rooms are very stuffy - they really need to update and get air conditioning, but there is a fan in the rooms these days. I really noticed the bathrooms need a full overhaul this time.
The kids club really needs to improve and they need to see what other hotels provide, and have it supervised and create a bigger area, most hotels now provide this service and many of them smaller and less busy than here. they should have there movie evening supervised if small hotels can employ a teenager for the summer to do the kids club so should a large hotel.
Breakfast is still chaos most mornings especially if arrive after 9.15.
The evening menu is OK only considering it's a hotel the variety is limited.
The best thing going for it is the location.You even pay for parking as a guest even though it is not in the city.",4,2012,08,19
249,"Rooms not cleaned but location, facilities and food v good.","I stay in this hotel with my 3 kids twice a year as you cannot beat the location, shopping centre on your doorstep, Tayto Park 25 mins away, zoo 15 mins, Dundrum 20 mins etc. The pool is great but I would advise management to speak to the lifegaurd as he wasn't there for 30 mins while I was there & the rest of the time he had no heed on lifesaving!!!!!

I always stay in the apartments and find them fantastic. They are extremely warm though so if I had a small baby I would worry about overheating. 

Again the big negative is the housekeeping. I've complained before but it hasn't improved. When we arrived our apt was missing the camp bed & the fridge was still dirty from the previous guests with their out of date food still in it!!!!!! I rang 3 times to get bed & ask for fridge to be cleaned at 9.30 (bed was for a 4 year old that should have been in bed at 8!!!) the bed arrived but the fridge was never cleaned. At this stage I cleaned the fridge myself!! On checkout I told the receptionist who appeared shocked even though I had spoken to him on one of the phonecalls! 

Food in the bar was, as always, very good.

249,was delighted with the standard provided esp considering the low price.,"i stayed in the clarion for 3 nights mid week recently with 4 of my children, aged 11, 9, 6 and 2. my husband and i had 2 seperate rooms and split the kids between us as this was the cheapest way to stay. check in was very fast, we were provided lots of information and made to feel very welcome. the room was exactly as it looked on the website and i was surprised to find it exactly the way it was on day one every time we arrived back after a day out, they even took time to fold the children's pyjamas on their pillows. it was such a nice touch, we don't get away very often! breakfast every morning was exceptional. and the staff, cleaners, waitresses, receptionists porters,  couldn't have been friendlier. managed to park pretty much right outside the door everyday. if i had to complain about something it would be only that because we had a full schedule that we didn't make great use of the pool because it closes a little early. but really this just means that in future i wont pay over 100 euro to go to the aquatic centre when there's a really nice pool in the hotel. will definitely stay there again.",5,2012,08,19
249,Never Again.,"Hi.  We stayed at this hotel for two nights, Tues. and Wed. nights this past week.  Soooo many things, wish I had consulted Trip Advisor first before booking and checking in.  

Firstly, the set up of the hotel. 

When we finally found our room through the maze of signs and elevators, (two elevators and two very long hallways) we realised it was a disabled room with no tub.  That was one thing we were looking forward to as we don't have a tub at home.  

Secondly, if any one of us were disabled in any sort of way and a fire broke out, we'd be dead.  Four floors up; at the very end of a hallway.  No elevator use.  What were they thinking when they planned that one out?

Thirdly.  Went for a swim.  Rather than showering and getting ready in a public shower area, I'd rather go back to my room and do that....you have to traipse past the bar area,  through the entire lobby area, then down two very long hallways to get back to room.  Absolutely crazy.

Fourth. Room was stiflling hot.  What modern hotel does not have an air conditioning system?  That was just crazy.

Fifth.  Windows only opened about one inch.  I understand a safety issue with children but ONE INCH????  There was practically hurricane of wind going on outside but we still had to have the fan going full because none of that wind could get in through the window!!!

Bathroom dingy.  Water marks on the ceiling.  Two lousy sachets of sugar with all the tea and coffee sachets.

The ONLY two things I can say are: the mini fridge in the room was handy and the breakfast buffet was yummy, (even though we had to wait in line for 1/2 hour)

We stayed in room 654......be wary.  It's a very long trek.  And we are healthy and able.

This hotel was booked with the Supervalu breaks.  Just felt that because of this we were given the crap room.  I book about five or six of these a year just for the break and this was truly the worst hotel experience we have had.  And by the way, I have also stayed in very very luxurious hotels that claim to be four or five stars.  Cannot believe how you can call this a four star establishment.  Oh, and another by-the-way, I used to work in the hospitality industry, for years responding to client comments.  I know my marketing and I know certain things about hotels and customer service.  I know what I'm talking about.",2,2012,08,18
249,"Clarion ""Lippy"" Valley","Arrived with our two children 14/11 at 4 p.m.Like so many others room not ready.
Did we want to go for a swim?
Did we want to go out?
No we wanted to get to our room for a rest after our journey.All was o.k at 5.00.p.m.
Seems lots of guests had the same problem.
Room was stifling.We should have known as there was a free standing fan when we arrived.
Extremely hot in the room,but as the receptionist said,there is no air conditioning.
I can understand the hotel wanting people to stay on site,however some of the kids activities are
advertised and do not in fact happen(e.g.teen zone gym).
Im so glad we did not opt for breakfast as the queue which presented at reception was looooong.
I also witnessed the attitude of desk staff.It is my opinion that they have listened to many complaints that ""whatever""is the order of the day.
In conclusion this hotel is very big,very impersonal,conveyor belt accomodation.
Certainly unimpressed.",3,2012,08,17
249,"Very large hotel, facilities very nice, food really good & staff helpful","Good enough location for getting around Dublin and surrounding area's.  Facilities are more than ample and kids had good fun in pool. (could do with an inbetween size pool, kiddies pool is very shallow for an 7/8/9 yr olds)  Rooms nice clean, very very hot also, ask not to stay on motorway side of hotel as noise level is quite high and unable to sleep too well. 
We had lovely meals in the bar area and in the main restaurant area standard very high well done to all for this. All in all we got it for fantastic price and breakfast was very nice too so I would reccomend this for a good budget break.",4,2012,08,17
249,Nice hotel - rooms far too warm,"We are just back from a 3 night stay at this hotel. Check-in went quickly and smoothly with no issues. We took our 3 kids to the swimming pool and found it very clean. Was glad to see the lifeguard on duty that day putting 2 teenagers out of the jacuzzi as they obviously weren't 18 and likewise she was quite vigilant with a couple of kids mucking about....she did her job well.
The room was clean, tidy and had all the bits and pieces we needed although the heat was unbearable (with no radiators on)...our window was open (permanently as it was broken, room 318)...we didn't mind that as it needed to be open....thankfully there was a fan which we kept on constantly...without it our kids couldn't even sleep.
All the staff we encountered were very nice...all greeted us with a smile and a hello and were helpful when we had a question.
Good kids' facilities with a playroom and a movie every night at 8pm....
The restaurant was ok...although I didn't like that their menu showed no prices which left us guessing until we got our 87 euro bill...the waiter was very nice and helpful though...
Go for breakfast either really early or at the last min....if you decide to go around 8:30, you will queue!!! It's like feeding time at the zoo around that time...
Overall the hotel is very nice...but a little out of the city and for us country folk not used to the M50 it can be a hair-raising experience going into the city! ;)
I think we would go back though...",3,2012,08,17
249,Excellant overall,"Very quick friendly check-in ,nice room,very comfortable bed,very clean everywhere,good bathroom,fantastic pool and leisure facilities,my son loved it ,would definatly stay again,excellant check out on tv",4,2012,08,16
249,Holiday,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, especially the pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi which was included in the price. There was also a kids room, which maybe could have been updated for age 7. My son had difficulty getting the remote for the games console, maybe you should have two set ups. The only other toys in the room were designed for girls or smaller kids. Although this isn't a major complaint because we had a very busy holiday + had plenty to do but this is just a minor point. My son also enjoyed the movie available every night but the room was very warm!! He also enjoyed the cinema style popcorn + treats. The adults also enjoyed having a variety of restaurants to choose from. The staff were very helpful + accommodating with any requests we made. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2012,08,14
249,robbed in our room,"we stayed there in july it was suppose to a break for myself and my friend and our two kids we arrived at hotel and they upraded us to an apartment which we were delighted as it meant more room for the kids on the friday night the kids enjoyed a movie , so on the saturday we visited the zoo and before we left hotel we placed a do no disturb sign on our door but when we returned a fresh towels have been placed in the bathroom of which we didnt really mind at the time but as the night progressed one of the kids woke up and said that there was someone in the room of which we thought it was just the child having a bad dream and put the child back to bed at that point the light didnt come on but the next  morning we discovered the the key card was missing which would expalin why the lights had gone off and there was money missing from our purses and two memory cards for a camera ,we were annoyed over the money but it scared us to think someone had being in the room with our kids or that could have taken them we reported it to hotel management of which we thought they would sort it out so we didnt report it to gardai or did they offer to report it looking back now we should have repoted it to gardai but we trusted the hotel to do the right thing by its customers we contacted them by email on our return home and they said no one had accesed the room only us and gave us a printed report  they had only one camera which was at the lift yet there was a stairwell outside our room but no camera as you can imagine we were very disapointed with our stay and more disapointed in the events that took place and needless to say disapointed with the reaction of the hotel in how it dealt with it so we will not be staying there again as we had stayed there several times before and our stay had been enjoyable",2,2012,08,14
249,Differing opinions!!,"I have read the past page of reviews and I can empathise with the differing reviews. We (family of 2+2) have stayed here on a total of 9 weekends over the past 4 years using std rooms , suites and we think the most suitable for us is the executive room. We tend not to take the buffet breakfast and usually rustle up something small in the room kitchenette and eat in the city or at whatever location ( Croke park) that we may be heading to. Saying that, the breakfast is excellent but we feel that is is not worth €30 per 2+2 per morning. At weekends there will be lots of kids and many sporting clubs seem to use the hotel for their trips to Dublin. You can be unlucky at check in and out with the queues ( bus of  tourists just landed before us) but overall I think that one has to expect these things ( There were 4 helping behind reception) We had a problem with the kettle and it was replaced within 5 mins. kids games room needs attention as neither pool table or table soccer worked. Under ground carpark seems fairly secure with roller shutter doors. One might be upset about the €4 overnight charge but if you stay for more that 1 night then a deal can be done. Chambermaids were excellent with ware and beds spotless each evening. It suits our situation for family weekends away in Dublin.",4,2012,08,11
249,Good rates and facilities... but public areas are an unsupervised creche,"I paid €69 to stay here last week; I was attending an event in the hotel and for convenience decided to stay on site. I took a taxi from Heuston railway station in the city centre which including tip cost about €15 and took about 15 minutes.

Things didn't start well when I arrived at 12.45, more than an hour before official check-in time. I've worked front desk, and I know that check-in time means the time after which you are guaranteed a ready room, and not ""you can't check in before this."" Unfortunately this is what the unfriendly agent I encountered told me. She said check-out time was only 12 (had every single person in the hotel waited until noon to check out the night before?! I doubt it...) and that I'd have to wait for my room. I said that was fine, but I was in a rush and would take any room available. She called housekeeping and gave them a specific room number -- again, a bit weird, because the thing to do is to check guests into suitable clean rooms as they arrive. Still, perhaps they needed me to go into this particular room, as I was only staying one night and maybe ""filling a hole"" in their room allocations. Whatever. She told me it would be at least 45 minutes and I told her I'd wait in the lobby, on the chairs right in front of her desk. 

As in the Clarion Hotel in Cork, to get service at the lobby tables you press a little inaudible buzzer which supposedly alerts the staff that you'd like to order a coffee or something. And, just like the Clarion in Cork, no one came despite my pressing the button at regular intervals for several minutes. 

After twenty minutes or so, my unfriendly agent disappeared off to lunch, so I went back to desk to ask someone else if my room was ready. He said it was, and seemed surprised that I was waiting. 

The bad news stopped here temporarily, because I was upgraded from a standard room to one of their apartment suites. (Presumably because I was only there for the night, and they correctly guessed that one person wouldn't make too much of a mess.) There was a large living room with tidy kitchenette, beautifully large bedroom with a king and a bathroom. The decor was really sumptuous and I could have happily spent a week in the room. It was very hot, but there was an oscillating fan in the bedroom so things weren't too bad when that was on, although you might have been annoyed by the noise. The hallways too were quite hot and stuffy; it seems odd that if the building's heating system isn't controllable room-to-room, someone would just turn it down all over the place.

I went to my event, and ordered room service afterwards. It came quick enough, but €20 for a tasteless pizza that was mostly inedible and a flat, warm glass of Coke left me unimpressed. Then the children started running up and down the halls outside my room...

Be warned: this is a VERY kid-friendly hotel. Overly so, because their family friendly atmosphere actually alienates their kidless guests. Children are running around everywhere -- the halls,the lobby, the restaurant areas -- and no one, including their parents, are making any effort to quieten them. 

I skipped the expensive breakfast the next morning and walked the 5 minutes to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre to get breakfast for €5 instead. (There was also a restaurant beside the hotel that seemed to be doing a cheaper cooked breakfast than the Clarion, so that's also an option.) Got the same couldn't-care-less attitude at check-out, and was surprised that the guy next to me was being checked in... considering it was only 10.30 a.m.

Hmm.

All in all, I would return to the Clarion Liffey Valley if the rate was €69 or less, but you need to know what you're getting into: a very large, very well apppointed creche. It seems a waste to me with such nice rooms that the hotel actively turns off business travellers with their atmosphere. I've stayed in the Clarion in Cork and the Clarion in Dublin city centre, and they aren't like this at all -- they're the other extreme, i.e. practically snooty. I'd take snooty any day though over kids running up and down the hall outside my room screaming until after midnight.

The staff in the bar and coffee station outside of the Kudos restaurant were all lovely, but the front desk staff (I encountered) need to drop the attitude and try being genuinely pleasant to their guests instead. A big benefit for me was the proximitity to Liffey Valley shopping centre, which is serviced by buses to the city centre. Overall it's good value if you don't mind being far outside the city, or if it's your kids making the noise. 

I'd guess that during the school term, this is a much quieter hotel.",3,2012,08,11
249,Desperate,"Stayed in Clarion hotel on Sunday of August bank holiday weekend just like another reviewer here.  6 months pregnant, queued 20 minutes to check-in.  At check-in the receptionist ""pre-authorised"" €100 on our credit card but assured us that this money would not be taken from our card.  Went to hotel room to find that key card would not open door.  My husband returned to reception 3 more times before finally getting key cards that actually allowed us to access the room.  Took our daughter for a swim in the pool - very busy with an extremely lackadaisical lifeguard who had no interest whatsoever in guarding lives!  Queued 20 minutes to check out the next morning after feeling as if I had slept in a sauna, when our credit card was not accepted by machine as the hotel had in fact taken the €100 the previous day and were now trying to take another €69.  It is now four days since we checked out and the €100 has still not been put back on our credit card.  The hotel maintain they did not take €100 but the bank confirmed that this money has in fact been taken by Clarion Hotel, Liffey Valley.  This event ruined our weekend and is still stressing us out.",1,2012,08,09
249,fine hotel if you don't mind being outside Dublin city centre,"a perfectly fine hotel. with great childrens facilities, good dining options and easy access from the west of Ireland. It is ideal if you wish for cinema or shopping centre shopping but not so perfect if you prefer to be closer to Dublin. We had a problem with a fire alarm going off but I guess this was a once off.",4,2012,08,08
249,Truly memorable family holiday,"We are just back from a 3 night stay in this hotel. We checked in at 10am Sunday morning. Due to being so early our room was not ready but we were able to leave our bags in and were helped by the very helpful Jana at reception. We did not arrive back till 9pm. We checked in and Geoffrey at reception was very efficient and helpful. He made our holiday by upgrading us to the Penthouse suite in the hotel. It was outstanding. The kids were ecstatic and we were thrilled also. The buffet breakfast had everything we wanted. The pool was fab and well looked after. We were 15 minutes drive from Dublin zoo, 10 minutes walk to Liffey valley shopping centre and 20 minutes in the bus into Dublin city. An absolute gem of a hotel for families and we will definatley be back ",5,2012,08,08
249,One night only,"Booked the Sunday night of the August bank holiday weekend. I felt that €79 was good value for the family room. Called a couple of days beforehand to ask for early check-in as my son and I were going to Croke park.
Arrived at 1pm and the early check-in wasn't available. I was ok with that seeing as it was the bank holiday weekend.
I was told at reception that our room would be available at 2. I headed off to the match and my wife and kids spent some time in the shopping centre to pass the time.
My wife arrived back at 3.30 to check in but the room wasn't available yet. She was asked would she like to use the pool while she waited so had to get their swimming gear from our bags in the middle of the foyer!!
She came back at 4.45 and eventually checked in and went to the room.
The room had not been cleaned!! Then waited until 5.30 before she eventually could get into our room.
The staff were rude about the situation and never made any attempt to apologise.
The room was really stuffy but there was a fan which had to be turned on the whole time we were there. 
We went to the bar for dinner about 8pm and that was really really tasty.

As for coming back... that was a one night only stay!!",2,2012,08,07
249,terrible weekend!!!!!,"Omg what a disaster, first of all when we arrived at the hotel(which was very easy to find) the young girl seemed a bit off, did not get a good welcome(which put me in a bad mood straight away). Then went to room which was really stuffy and looked very tired in need of a lick of paint and a new carpet, dirty toilet and hairs in bath, lovely. It was not for us as me and my husband are both 50, too many kids. Cannot really say any member of staff seemed to really enjoy their job, we left a day early and they didnt even ask why???? would not go back!!!!",1,2012,08,06
249,"Fantastic Value for your money. Awesome Gym ,sauna,steam room.","I stayed at the ClarionHotel ,Liffey Valley, Dublin 22 on 3rd and 4th August 2012. This hasto be the best value for your money hotel that I have ever stayed at. I paidaround £98 for two nights room only. This hotel offers a fantastic new modernswimming pool equipped with sauna, steam and hot Jacuzzi pool all included inthe price. The rooms are very modern and offer coffee, tea, fridge, iron, hairdryer etc. I asked for a soft pillar as the one I had was quite hard and itarrived within ten minutes.

You can catch thenumber 40 bus just around the corner from the hotel right into the centre ofDublin. Bus cost 2.65 Euro’s each way and takes around 25 minutes. Bus stopsright outside the GPO and is right by the Pin so it’s easy to find your wayback for the return trip.  You have topay 4 Euros a day hotel parking but this is nothing compared to parking in theheart of Dublin City Centre. The hotel has to make its money somehow as the accommodationis so very cheap compared to staying in the heart of Dublin.

Once again I have tohighly recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of visiting Dublin especiallyif you have a car. Beware; that TomTom SatNav Clarion Hotel search directs youto the Clarion in the heart of Dublin City centre.  Type in street name Fonthill Road as this iswhere you will find the hotel . Ireland doesn’t have post codes so make sureyou get the name of the street.

This is a Great Hotelwith fantastic facilities at such low cost. I had to pinch myself as it’s toogood to be true. What a bargain. Many thanks Clarion Hotel for making our staysuch an enjoyable one.",5,2012,08,06
249,Great value and location,"Decided to bring the kids to Dublin zoo and really wanted a place with a separate bedroom for the kids, this was close to impossible but I eventually booked an executive suite at the clarion Liffey valley. 
This was a lovely room. We had a little hall, door in to tv room with leather couch that turned in to a double bed, 4 seater table and chairs and kitchenette with sink, microwave, fridge, all ware and cutlery. Then separate bedroom with king size bed.
This was all lovely only negative would be the bathroom, shower in the bath with shower curtain....pet hate of mine. But other this it was great and would definitely return with the kids. Oh and the room was roasting, hard to sleep it was so hot.
5 minute walk to Liffey valley shopping centre.
Check in was very busy and was waiting around 15mins but receptionist was lovely and very helpful. 
Swimming pool lovely with big changing rooms.
Didn't eat there as restaurant was packed the next morning, long queue to be seated so we headed to the shopping centre",4,2012,08,05
249,Noisey and Hot!,"Stayed at the Clarion in their apartments for one night.  Location and ease of getting to this hotel is great, really well sign posted etc. The apartment itself is also fine, its clean and well equiped.  However the noise from both the traffic outside and the lack of respect from other guests ruined this experience.  There was no air con so the rooms were really stuffy and hot.  Opening or closing the windows made no difference to this and noise from the traffic outside gave us all a sleepless night.  Other guests in the apt complex had loud music from about 12am - 2am, they obviously had no consideration for other people, especially those of us with babies!  Staff at reception were nice and friendly.  Breakfast was also fine too with a good choice of food available.  However with the apartments overlooking the main road it wouldn't make sense to return to this hotel again.",2,2012,08,04
249,No Car Park security,"I recently stayed overnight at this hotel while doing a job in Dublin. The foreman of the building site I was on asked me where I was staying that night and when I told him he said not a good choice as his van and five other vehicals had been broken into the previous week. When I arrived at the hotel checkin was slow and when I tried to book the dinning room I was told it was closed during the week so I had to eat in the bar which was very noisy and not a great choice of dishes. I tried to order the only half bottle of red wine on the wine list but was told it had not been is stock for weeks.

I had breakfast early (OK)  and checked out, but was a bit anoyed as they charged me for overnight parking. When I got my van in the carpark I found that the drivers mirror assembly had been stolen! I asked for the duty manager who told me that nothing like this ever happens at this hotel. when I told him what the foreman had said about the previous weeks breakins he said he must have been off that day! He called the Guards (Irish police) who arrived about an hour later. The Guard who took my details said ""nice hotel shame about the area"". There was a CCTV camera looking straight at my van but was told that even though the hotel has a CCTV system it is unmanned at night so anything can go on unnoticed.
The hotel said they would look at paying for the repair but have stopped answering my emails.

I did not even get a refund for the parking!",1,2012,08,03
249,perfect family hotel,"Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children) stayed in the Clarion for 3 nights and we were very impressed with service we got. The hotel is spacious , modern, lively and we upgraded to an executive suite when booking to accomodate our older girls of 15 and 13. This was a great decision because the room was spacious; with the childrens room seperate but excessable sharing an ensuite. Each room had a kitchen area with a kettle, a toaster, fridge, sink unit and stocked cupboards for dining indoors at night. The staff were very pleasant and courteous and nothing was a problem to them, especially the swimming pool staff. At night (every night) there was a free movie in one of the conference rooms for the kids with up to date movies and a play room during the day with Wii and video games. This is the ideal hotel for families and we could not find a fault with it.Great value for money.Excellant food.",5,2012,08,03
249,family friendly hotel Dublin,"We are a family of two adults and 3 kids and we stayed in the Clarion self catering apartments which were great.Standard hotel room are no use to us, everybody packed in one room is not a holiday for the adults. We got a great rate of €99 per night.The pool  and dressing rooms very clean and the staff very helpful.The location is very good for a number of tourist attractions or for travelling further down the country.
Two areas for improvement would be the childrens play room there was nothing here for my kids of 3, 5 and 7.There was a film each night but the room is too far away to leave the kids unsupervised.It would be great if they had somebody to look after the kids during his time.We had a meal one night which was  priced OK  but not that impressive.
Overall we would return to this hotel.",4,2012,08,03
249,Perfect base for Dublin visit.... some small issues,"Booked for 2 days through the super value deal, so cost was very good value.  On arrival we were dissapointed to find that the carpark was 4 euro per day, not only that, 2 of the four wheelchair car places were taken with commercial vehicles with no permit, I told the duty manager who apologised and did nothing about it as one of the vehicles parked there the following evening as well.  Rooms were clean and spacious, but VERY warm with no Air con.  A fan was provided but not really effective.  Breakfast was EXCELLENT as was dinner in the restaurant, the menu for the SV deal one of the best I have seen.  Pool was nice if a bit cold for the kids, but showers were warm and very well organised.  Had lunch in the bar, food excellent.  Staff very helpful.  Location excellent, we used it as a base for the Zoo, for an appointment to Crumlin Childrens Hospital and to City Centre.... Found reception to be very busy and long wait for any sort of service, only one person on desk at check out yet at 8pm there were 3 behind the desk.....",4,2012,08,03
249,Excellent hotel in a great location,"I booked a single room for 1 night, on arrival it was obvious that the hotel was very busy with guests.  As there was no room at the rate I booked available, I was given an upgrade to a suite on the 4th floor.  It was excellent, spacious and very clean, the only negative for me was being wakened by the early traffic on the N4.  Food and service was excellent.  I have stayed at this hotel many times during the past 5 years and each time never disappointed.   The only complaint would be the temperatures in the rooms as they tend to get very warm and there is no air con. It has good facilities and in a great location with Liffey Valley shopping centre nearby.",4,2012,08,02
249,One night - was enough,"Stayed in hotel on Friday the 27th of July  - for one night.  

On the plus side - the hotel is very nicely located - close to Dublin but also close to the shops at liffey valley.  The hotel reception area is bright and spacious, staff are pleasant.  Good value - if you get a cheap deal.  Leisure club always a plus. Comfortable bed. Fridge in room.

On the minus side - very busy when we arrived, so queue to check in.  The room was not so spacious and was very stuffy ( it was an unusually warm night).  It was very noisy - lots of loud people outside at 3 in the morning! So had little sleep.  The noise when one flushed the loo was like a fog horn going off.  The breakfast in the morning was another long queue .... not really acceptable.  Was it worth queuing for?  well if you like runny porridge that is made on water and plenty of it, and the usual buffet which was not to pleasing to the eye - then yes.  Otherwise do not bother to queue.  Car parking charges of 4euro per night.",3,2012,08,02
249,"Could do better.... much, much better.","We stayed for two nights and I was thoroughly disappointed. Check-in was slow and the rooms looked nothing like they did in the pictures on the Clarion website. They were tired and old to say the least. There is no air con and the rooms are stiflling. A very old and rickety looking fan is your only means of cooling down. The rooms were clean but they did have a musty smell about them.
In the morning we ventured down to the restaurant for breakfast. A buffet menu of hot and cold foods is available. The crockery, glasses and cutlery were dirty. They seriously need to overhaul their dishwashers. The food was good and there is an excellent choice.... if you can find a clean plate. The waiting staff are surly and lazy in the main restaurant. The bar staff however in the Asian restaurant are warm, friendly and accommodating.
I will not be visiting again.",2,2012,08,02
249,average - ok for business,"Stayed here one night for business. Room is ok, bed was nice, huge and comfortable, but walls are very thin and could hear everything that happened next door, which was not comfortable. Also, it was really warm and even with windows open, it was really hot in the room. Good value overall and ok for business.",3,2012,08,01
249,overall...fabulous!!,"I stayed in the clarion hotel on friday past and from the moment myself and my boyfriend pulled up at the hotel i had a feeling this hotel was going to impress..place was full of cars and people out enjoying the sun, i immediately felt that there was going to be a bit of life around here. Check in went smoothly with the help of a very helpful receptionist that went out of his way to make us feel welcome. The room was lovely with a balcony and a good comfy bed (just what i asked for) ! We ate our dinner in the Kudos bar that evening which serves Asian cuisine (it was extremely busy...which gave me the impression that the food must be good!) We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who explained that the food may take up to half an hour as the place was very busy but apologised and offered to get us a few drinks while we waited..we didnt mind as the atmosphere was good and we were in no panic. when we eventually got the food it was FANTASTIC!! I had the chilli chow mein and my boyfriend had the 'best ever curry' both really tasty and filling! Service was great and we were taken care off to the best standard even though you could tell they were all rushed off their feet!! Breakfast the next morning was again great with a wide selection of food with a buffet type service..which kept himself happy ha! Checkout was swift and to the point no problems! All in all a very enjoyable stay and we will definitely be back!!",5,2012,07,30
249,not great,"We stayed here for one night as we were going to show in Dublin,Booked expecting it to be like other hotels in Clarion group but we were disappointed.The room was dirty to say the least!! unfortunately we didnt notice until qute late as when we arrived window was open and air was flowing through room,we changed and headed out closing window on way,on return we were met with a rather unpleasant smell which I can only describe bluntly as urine and it was bad in bathroom and floor was sticky!!,The chair at the dressing table had a hyge dried in spill stain of tea or something down the back and on seat.Bed was clean but it was to single beds pushed together,Then I noticed pillow in side pillow case was filthy and toren,I looked at my husbands pillow it wasnt toren but was dirty ,now enough is enough so my husband brought pillow to reception and asked for new ones,A very nice man came with two brand new pillows and was horrified when we showed him the chair etc ,He said he would leave a note for morning,The breakfast was lovely and lots of variety no complaint there,After breakfast we asked to see manager and a nice young lady appeared note pad in hand she wrote complaints down and disappeared to see if she could reduce bill in anyway when she came back she said payment was taken from our card on check in but asked for our email address and she would email her details so as if we came back again she could upgrade us or give resturant discount,Suprise suprise we never heard from her again.We were not looking for anything but an explaination as to why a room was give to a guest in that condition,The hotel was full of families and my guess is they had not enough staff to cope,I have stayed in a lot of hotels and apartments all over the world and my advice is avoid because I can honestly say event though I showered I felt dirty leaving the Clarion in liffey valley.",2,2012,07,30
249,fantastic hotel (bit of a funny smell),"we stayed in an apartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 TV's washing machine kitchen etc, My initial reaction when i went into the room was (whats the horrible smell) it smelled like an old ashtray and the balcony was littered with used cigarettes. The room was fab, the area is lovely.  The restaurant food is beautiful, there is no way you are leaving here hungry.  There is a very small play ground but my kids loved it. Really enjoyed the stay here and would definately go back again but the smell continued through the holiday (its a good reflection of the hotel that we could overlook this)",4,2012,07,28
249,disappointed.,"We ordered a double room (not on a last minute booking site, well in advance) and when we arrived, it was two single beds pushed together. When we asked to be moved to an actual double room, we were told the double beds are reserved for the suites. The room was roasting, but it wasn't on a particularly sunny day. Oh and there's no wi-fi in the rooms. Disappointing, considering we regularly stay in Clarions. On the other hand, the staff were lovely :)",2,2012,07,28
249,Lovely,This hotel is lovely in a great location food is gorgeous and rooms are clean and spacious...stayed here for one weekend with dinner and really enjoyed it. We asked for a room with a balcony and it was lovely and bright it was very clean n cleaned on both days of our stay,5,2012,07,26
249,"Clean, friendly staff, ideal for business travellers","We stayed here for the second time recently for a conference and found the hotel to be clean, modern and the staff were helpful. There was very little soap in the dispenser but we left a note for the cleaners and it was re-filled for us. The room was very warm even though the radiator was not on so we needed to have the fan going all night and while we got dressed in the morning. Pillows were a little flat but otherwise good nights sleep. We ate in the restaurant one night and it was nice Asian cuisine but were disappointed to have missed the ""steak and a pint for 15 Euro"" which had been on the night before.  All in all a good hotel but more marketed towards business travellers than families.",3,2012,07,25
249,Great service,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel with our twin babies and I have to say that we were very happy with the professional service we got from all the staff we encountered. They couldn't do enough for us in accommodating our babies during our stay. I would highly recommend it, especially for families staying in the Dublin area.",5,2012,07,23
249,From the moment we arrived... Wonderful...,"Stayed here on Friday night and had such a great time we tried to book again for the sat night but it was totally booked.. We got a brilliant deal.. We were looked after and from swimming pool to rooms to restaurant it was a clean, very friendly and very comfortable..the food was just delicious and plenty too.. For the 2 kids they had a great time in the pool, in the movie room,then to the play room and then to the bar where we could have a much deserved drink while they all played around us with some other kids.. The staff were very helpful and made us feel very welcome and it was like they were thanking us for staying with them when it was really us that should be thanking them.. I would definatly recommend this hotel to anyone with kids or even a weekend away..  5 mins walk to the shopping and in the road to Dublin.. ",5,2012,07,23
249,Cheap deals make this an ok choice,I got a €59 deal for a single occupancy room only as a stop over when coming form the west of Ireland to Dublin last week. The place seemed busy so that tells you something. The place is big and impersonal and took forever to get to my room. The room was a twin but only one of the beds were made - it seemed that the room had been finished by the housekeeper that day. Bathroom was clean but towels were left piled up next to the sink. The tv didn't work. Still I only needed one bed and it was late so I read my book for a few minutes before sleeping. Overall better value vs nearly twice the price for a 3 star in town but no great shakes.,3,2012,07,21
249,Good value hotel,"Good honest hotel ,food and breakfast just fine good location if you are driving. Just could do with air con in rooms during summer months. I would have even paid xtra for it.",4,2012,07,17

249,Great Hotel for Business travellers.,"I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and everytime I have been very happy with the service I get when staying.
The staff are always very helpful, efficient and Friendly.
The food is very good and there is plenty of choice on the menu. Buffet 'all you can eat' breakfast - also very good.
The rooms are clean and tidy with comfortable beds and nicely decorated and fitted out.
Although WiFi is available and free in the public areas, Internet connectivity in the rooms is only achievable via a cabled connection to your PC or Mac.
Ample / secure hotel parking however you will need to budget for €4 per night.
Great location - only about 20 minutes drive from Dublin Airport.
Will definately use this hotel again and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,07,17
249,Nice for the price!!,"I really enjoyed staying at the Clarion Liffey Valley. My friends and i were going to a concert in phoenix park recently and decided to stay up for the night in this hotel. We werent supposed to check in until 2 o clock however the concert started at 3. We arrived at the hotel at 11.30 and the staff were very helpful and allowed us to check in then even though the hotel appeared very busy as we had to queue to check in. 

I would however recommend that u prepare to pay a 100 euro deposit at check in which shocked me a little as it is a steep deposit however the room was very cheap ( we only paid 59 euro). The hotel room was very nice we thought for the price we paid. We thought the room was very spacious  and clean. Sure if u wanted to pick faults you could of (like paint chipped slightly in places), however this was not seen and we werent bothered..we had to go looking for this problem. 

We found the beds comfortable and after the concert we were more then delighted to hop into them. The only awkward thing in relation to this hotel was the location for us as it is quite some time away from phoenix park (about 10-15 minutes) and the city centre, however u cud not walk it easily which made it hard for us to get a taxi back after a busy concert.

Overall i thought for the price we paid we were very happy with this hotel and would definitly stay here again.",4,2012,07,16
249,Such value for money,"My girlfriend and i stayed in an aprtment on saturday and sunday night 7th and 8th and couldnt get over the size, cleanliness and just class of them. we got a great deal online and were shocked at the value for money we got. great leisure centre. nice bar with very obliging staff. bar food was not really to our taste but with so much around it was perfect. will definitely return. Dealt with a girl named jenny at front desk and she was a class above the rest. Highly recommended!",4,2012,07,15
249,pleasent stay,Staff v helpful a bit outside Dublin city center but comfortable hotel. Good secure carparking underground 4 euro per 12 hours. Lovely clean rooms would stay there again,3,2012,07,15
249,A great stay,"We stayed here for a weekend stay in Dublin and we were very happy with our stay.The staff we all lovely and very helpful, Kudos restaurant had great food on offer and the standard of the hotel in general was brilliant. Its also in a really convenient location for Dublin City centre and Liffy Valley shopping centre is literally on the door step. We booked a double room and we were on the ground floor. The room was nice and modern and comfortable. The showers are amazingly powerful. The TVs are old square ones but it was fine to watch. We would definitely stay here again our only criticisms are: there is no WIFI in the rooms only plug in internet which most modern laptops don't have a connection for ( neither of our laptops have one ) there is WIFI in the reception and other common areas though but it would have been better to have it in the room. Also you have to pay €4.00 a day for car parking even if you are a guest. All in all we were very happy, Thank you Clarion :)",5,2012,07,15
249,Kindergarten,"Nice people at reception, but the noise from the runaway type of children who roam all over the place and make REAL noise almost put me off booking in. Rooms are ok, but basic, Couldn't get into the restaurant, didn't book apparently, it was full of kids again, so we had some food in the bar which was tasty and good value, but again the loud children didn't help. I wish parents, or partners, would learn the basics in child rearing. It was the same in the morning at breakfast.",2,2012,07,11
249,"Second Visit, Probably the last","This was our second visit to the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley,I will say our first visit was very enjoyable as one would expect  in a Clarion Hotel, On our arrival the reception/check in desk,staffed by 3 people was busy.We waited and waited,finally the centre desk came free
but the staff member on there disappeared.Left and right desks were busy,then at last,the left side desk became free,we could check in. No we could not we were queue jumped. The staff member should have corrected the situation but did not. Then the desk on the right hand side became free and we checking in. No the phone rang and the receptionist had to check room availability for somone on the phone and she was gone but not for long, then she came back and we completed the check in   All fine.
We proceded to go to our room,this hotel has long corridors and in one corridor we had to pass through, it had bedroonm doors open on both sides with rude young people shouting across at each other.I never saw this behaviour in a hotel before. Shocking 
We reserved a table for dinner for 19.30, Asked for a specific table ,yes fine.
When we arrived for dinner we told the staff member we had this table reserved.brought us to a  different one. We wanted the one we reserved,there was no one at it, we got the reserved table.
Service was slow but we were in no hurry.Others came in sat at a 4 table ,waited ,waited, and then got up and left,no one attended, 2 ladies then got up and left,tired of waiting
After dinner we went to our room because of the noise coming from the bar.

All well until 1 am when a lot of noise started in the next room, loud talking, loud music, banging doors.Very unmannerly people kept us awake most of the night
This was the weekend of the Pheonix Park concert, were these people attending 
A hotel of this status should surely beef up security on weekends like this
Reception staff, why walk off with guests waiting?
Perhaps a lesson from the Hilton Hotels Reception may help
We did complain - We got no reduction in price or an alternative night at a reduced price",1,2012,07,10
249,Characterless but comfortable,"The location struck me as being a bit out of the way, just off the motorway. Staff on a Sunday night were somewhat indifferent. The hotel is clean and modern and at €60 inc breakfast good value. The room was spacious but no aircon - just a free standing fan. The room has a safe. I had a family room with a separate lounge and kitchen. It was clean, tidy and everything I tried, worked. Good channel choice on TV.

Breakfast was an OK buffet, the juice machine must have been faulty as what came out of the orange dispenser was only slightly coloured water - yuk.

Overall, it reminded me of an Ibis without the charm",3,2012,07,10
249,Great value for families,"I went to this hotel with a group of parents of a hurling team. We all booked together to a place conveniently situated to the group of matches they were playing - so I had no real choice about where to go. I was very apprehensive due to previous reviews on tripadvisor. And I was so pleasantly surprised.
We did have to queue to check in as hundreds of parents all int eh same competition all arrived at the same time. So that wasnt terrific - but the staff were very pleasant and apologised profusely and the check in itself was seamless
The family room was spotless. Big - a bedroom a bathroom and another room with a pull out sofa already made up and a little kitchen.
One thing - it is really warm. REALLY warm. But we put on the fan and opened the window and were grand.
The staff were really helpful and managed the huge crowds really well.
Breakfast is good - loads of it and filled us up - not fabulous. But good.
Free wifi downstairs was great.
And the swimming pool etc is well maintained and again spotless.
We paid 69euros for all of us per night. GREAT value - would definitely go back",4,2012,07,09
249,disappointed,"My wife and I booked this hotel only because of previous stays in this place, which were great! Unfortunately, we failed this time. hotel looks like an old and well-kept roadside inn. Rooms clearly needs to be refreshed. However, both the most disappointed in the bar staff. completely new faces there, giving the impression the entities claiming the punishment. where are those people who gave soul to this place?",2,2012,07,08
249,Average,Previously reviewed this hotel about 5 years ago. Was a 3/5 then and same now. Good location. Bar food was decent but possibly over priced.. Breakfast (hot food items) was below average on my recent visit. It is a good value hotel and I would still stay there again once I got it at special offer price.,3,2012,07,06
249,A pretty good deal,"This ia a very conveniently located hotel if you have things to do in west Dublin and want to be close to the airport. Staff are friendly, hotel is clean. Reasonably priced, I would have to say that you need a car to get the most out of it. If you are on a budget you could do a lot worse. I've stayed in a couple of other Clarion hotels and the brand is consistent.",4,2012,07,03
249,Good value for money,"We got a last minute deal, paying under 60 euros for 3 adults, so weren't expecting much. But the room was fine, comfy beds, even the single, kettle, fridge, iron etc. The hotel even has a pool, but it was very busy with children, being holiday season. With no air conditioning, we had to have the window open over night, which meant there was quite a bit of noise coming off the dual carriageway nearby.  We checked in around 2pm without any problems but by 5pm, there was a long queue & only 2 staff on reception. Sunday morning there was again a long queue for breakfast. I wouldn't choose this hotel for a long stay but overnight, en route to the airport or ferry terminal, as we were, it was ideal. Really good value for money without losing out on quality of accomodation.",4,2012,07,02
249,Lxurious,"We were booked into the clarion hotel, liffey valley on a room only basis. When booking in the lovely gentleman at reception said, I will upgrade you to a suite if you would like as there is room. When we seen the suite, it was absolutely lovely, big, airy everything you could ask for. There was a kitchen with toaster microwave a washing machine, everything you could ask for. A separate living room & bedroom. This is the ideal place if you wanted to bring your own food or had children, it was much quieter than the main hotel. Breakfast was €12.50 in the restaurant if you wanted to avail of same. Definately will be asking for the suites next time I go.",5,2012,07,02
249,Would stay again!!!,"Great hotel in a great location, staff very friendly! Hotel was full to capacity due to Westlife concert, which we attended! But found the services very good, bit of a crowd for breakfast but moved fast! Highly recommend the Arc next door food was amazing and well priced, staff could not do enough for you! Would def book hotel again!! ",5,2012,06,25
249,Good if you're stuck,A good hotel if you're stuck for the night. Cheap and clean with good facilities and helpful staff. Walls are a bit thin and if you're on the ground floor it can be noisy. Have stayed there a couple of times and would use it again if the need arises.,3,2012,06,23
249,Great hotel,"Great rooms, friendly service. Only drawback is it is nit the most central place. Would however return for the quality and excellant brekfast. Thanks",5,2012,06,23
249,Good for family stay,"Myself, my husband and our 2 children were in Dublin for a christening so stayed here as it was very close to where the christening was on. The hotel was very clean and tidy although a few things need updating, like the chair in our room which was stained and torn. We were very happy with the room as there was a double bed and two single beds, usually the kids have to share a pull out couch. The only downside with the room is that there is no air conditioning, so we were very hot throughout the night. We didn't eat dinner there as we were out with family but there are 2 restaurants and both looked nice, there was also a good deal for dinner and cinema ticket for €19.95 which is a good price as the cinema cost about €10 for a ticket. The breakfast was lovely and met our needs. The pool was great, the kids loved it too but the changing rooms were very cold. The only other disappointing thing was that you had to pay for the car park, considering that it is a private car park owned by the hotel I think they should not charge. Overall it was enjoyable and i would stay there again. ",4,2012,06,21
249,Very busy!!,"We booked this hotel as an overnight stop whislt attending a 2 day competition.  The main attraction had been the swimming pool and fitness suite but when we arrived we were told it was closing early and they refused to let my children aged 15 and 16 use the pool early on the Sunday morning as it was for Adults only even though I explained they wanted to swim and not mess about.

Parking in the carpark which you have to pay for is very tight if you have a large car, I was a disabled driver and couldn't get a disabled parking space. 

The room was clean but our TV didn't work and we were told it was too late at 7pm to have it fixed!

The hotel was very busy and had a lot of children running around unsupervised which was a bit off putting as I always ensure my own 3 children don't annoy other guests!  We were told there would be an hour wait at the restuarant for a table so we ended up walking across the road for a McDonalds!

It would have been nice to have been told of changes to opening hours in the fitness suite as this was the main attraction for paying the extra for this hotel but for a one night stay this hotel was OK.  

The staff were friendly enough and the room was clean.  We didn't get to try the food as we left early the next morning without breakfast.",3,2012,06,17
249,Becareful when staying here,"The hotel gives great value for money; food is good, rooms cleans.
The only downside is parking a jeep or people carrier you could be missing your spare wheel.
Notice in car park you leave your car there at your own risk but you don't expect your spare wheel to be taken when your parked near the front door.",4,2012,06,16
249,"Brillaint hotel for children, would highly recommend","im writing this as my children are playing in the foyer. the place is full of children and everyone is having a great time.

this is a real touristy hotel and has a lovely buzz to it

families fit in right away, they take no notice of children being loud or running around,

we swam yesterday, played in the playroom this evening and had dinner in the bar, all good experiences, 

the staff are superb, very good with children and there is loads of room in the bedrooms for everyone, the only negative point is that the bar is soul less but this is common in most hotels,

i will definitely stay here again,",5,2012,06,16
249,I will not be back,"Booked in for 2 nights
Found furniture in room to be dusty and grubby. The tea tray provided was all dust with hairs!
Asked for milk which was promised but never delivered.
Chair in room stained with PAINT or something.
Shower curtain filthy and stained also.
How can this be 4 star? How are these ratings done? It is so misleading.",1,2012,06,14
249,Good customer service,"I've stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions and have had mixed experiences. My latest visit started badly but was rescued with some good customer service. I had booked a no-smoking room and made a point of confirming this when I checked in but when I reached the room (at the far end of the hotel) it stand of cigarette smoke. When I returned to reception to complain the receptionist immediately switched me to a ""better"" room. This turned out to be a suite with living room, kitchen and the biggest bedroom I've ever stayed in. As my suitcase had gone missing en-route to Dublin I very much appreciated this gesture.
The 2 coin-operated computers in the lobby were out of order so the same receptionist offered to print my boarding card for my return flight.
This hotel isn't without it's faults but it does offer good value for money and there are some excellent staff.",4,2012,06,14
249,Convenient,Excellent receptionist. We hadn't prebooked but made to feel very welcomed.The young man attending to the tables in the lounge was less responsive. Room was comfotable but being on the ground floor with the car park and delivery area immediately outside the room it was verey noisy in the early hours of the morningf. A dawn chorus!,3,2012,06,12
249,Very bad customer service we got,"Stead in this hotel in a smoking room my partner didnt want to smoke so made his way down to the door several times,at the early hours while I was sleeping he done the same and was then told by the security guard he left to many times and was asked to leave the hotel.
On notify me by calling me I woke and spoke to the manager but to no avail,so we both left at 5 in the morning for a fully paid room.",1,2012,06,12
249,Great value hotel away from city center.,Stayed in this hotel with my Mom recently and found it great value. If you are driving you have to be a bit careful to watch passing through M50 toll as hotel is very close to it and it's 3euro each time. Rooms are very clean and spacious. We were there the night of a very big wedding and hotel was very busy but we had no problems with noise or anything. If there's a drawback it's the parking fee- 4 euro a night but not too bad I guess.,4,2012,06,10
249,Great Suites for Families,"We have stayed at the Clarion many times as the Suites suit our family of 5 alot. W e usually book a one bedroom suite with a co, as the sofa in the  sitting room pulls out to a double room. The breakfast here is very good also. THis is a great hotel on the outskirts of Dublin city for young families. VEry close to Liffey Valley shopping centre also",4,2012,06,09
249,Good Value But A Bit Noisy!,"Just back from my stay at the Clarion. Location wise this Hotel is ideal for anyone who has anybody in the Hermitage Clinic or as a ""stayover"" before or after a Flight-there is also a shuttle service to the Airport and the Parking is relatively cheap. As already stated the Rooms were clean with a Queen and single bed, Fridge and Safe, bathroom was clean. Also there is a Fitness Centre and Pool free to Guests. Was a bit of chore changing channels on T.V. but got the hang of it after a while. The Hotel this June B/Holiday Weekend seemed to be full up. The negative side to this was that on Sunday the Bar and Reception area was Teeming with small children of which a lot of them were let run wild around the place by there Parents-this is  not good enough and Management should take note. Also if you are going to stay in the Clarion do not book a Room on the ground floor as all the guets who have rooms on the floors above yours will have to pass by your door to go to theres and its not nice to be woken up every couple of minutes of a B/H weekend night by Loud, Drunken Noisy people dragging there overtired children eventully to bed. I had a nice meal in the Restaurant and my nightly rate was not excessive but having ""offers"" and ""special deals"" very often can mean a certain amount of discomfort to ""other"" guests who would'nt mind paying a little extra so that standards could be maintained-if not bring earplugs if you are on the ground-floor and no airconditioning - Traffic noise also terrible.",2,2012,06,04
249,Not recommended,"Just back from a very disappointing stay at this hotel - this had been our 2nd (and last) stay there in the last 4 months. We (me, husband & our baby) booked a ""penthouse suite"" for 2 nights - be warned the room we was nice but looked nothing like the suite shown on the website. On check-in, we see a little sign saying the pool is closed for essential maintenance work which we were never told when looking at website or booking over the phone (you can't book suites online) so we say this to the woman checking us in. She just dismisses our complaints and says that everyone should have been told this but we weren't and a hotel with a pool to take our baby was one of the main reasons we booked. She said she'd pass this on to a manager but we never heard anything again about it. The room was clean for the most part although the curtains and one of the throw pillows had crusty stains on it which really creeped me out. After we put the baby to sleep in the cot provided, we went into the other room only to discover that tv was broken! The next day we told reception and they said they'd get someone to fix it but no one ever came to look at it. We also asked for our room to be serviced and 3 extra towels be left - no one serviced the room and all they left were 1 big towel and 1 hand towel. I was so shocked by the terrible service and bad attitudes of the people we dealt with and we will never be back again.",1,2012,05,30
249,Great Hotel just a little far out of the City,"Booked a two night break to dublin and looked at the Choice Hotel brand this one came up at only 59 euros per night (no breakfast) Said it was 11km from the City.  upon arrival we grabbed a cab which was 35 euros for 4 passengers the bus is 7 euros each.  Arrived at hotel and found it is a larger property,  Got our rooms right away and found a queen and single bed in each.  Rooms were very clean and appeared fresh an new.  Each had a small fridge and safe.  Bathroom was very clean with no mold on the caulk that you usually see.  Attached to the hotel is a fitness center and pool which is free for guests.  Only problem here is they only let kids in until 7pm and adults till 9pm and per Ireland rules every swimmer has to wear a swim hat which they sell for 3 euros each.  There was also a hot tube, steam room and gym.  The hotel had a bar and a seperate restaurant which were both pricey.  Across the road about 10 min walk is a large mall (Liffey Valley) Has a multi screem movie theather (Vue) also on the property,  If you don't have a car there is a bus to the City and it takes about 45/50 mins if you get the one from the mall and costs 2.65 euros per adult.  Takes you right to the Temple district or University.  There is another bus that goes from behind the hotel and goes down the motorway which is suppose to be quicker but we did not take it.  A cab to the city is about 25 euros.  Apart from the distance from the city this is a nice clean hotel",4,2012,05,28
249,Good for the price,"I stayed here for one night on business recently.  We paid less than €50 each for B&B in double rooms which is great value.  When we arrived the hotel was full and we were upgraded to the one bedroom apartments.

The rooms were comfortable and clean.  The apartments are well kitted with washing machine, dish washer, toaster, fridge, kettle and microwave/oven combo.  Nice to have a balcony also.

The swimming pool and changing rooms could seriously do with a freshen up and the pool water really irritated my eyes.

Breakfast was very good for buffet style and you can order your eggs cooked to your liking rather than accepting the usual trough of scrambled.

The staff were friendly and helpful though they all seemed pretty tired.

The only real negative for me is that you had to pay for your overnight parking which is unusual for residents in hotels this far from the city centre or airport.  It is only €4 for the night but it is still a pain.

I would use the Clarion again when on a quick business trip but would be reluctant to stay here for pleasure.",3,2012,05,24
249,just okay room was very DIRTY,"I booked a suite for my husband , toddler and baby when we arrived in the suite it was unhoovered and dirty , i called housekeeping who came and hoovered it I cleaned the tables etc myself from crumbs using dettol wipes, also one of our towels were dirty. Inside the curtains of the bedroom window there was cigarette ash in what was to be a non smoking room. Plus side is room was spacious and living area was great with the toddler. Restaurant was good first night and second night service was terrible , very slow and unprofessional, i asked three times for bill and asked twice for our desserts when I complained the bill was wrong she was quite snooty about it and it took two attempts for it to be rectified. The price was good but it does not take much to have a clean room.",2,2012,05,24
249,Potential to be great but misses the mark!,"We are a family of two adults and two older children. We had booked a one-bedroom suite having discussed with reservations that we needed more space than a double room provided.  On arrival at the suite we noted that the sofa had not been made up (this was to be the bed for our children).We attended a family function that day and didn't return to the hotel until 11.30 that night only to find the sofabed still unmade. When the person did arrive with the bedding - after we had phoned down to reception- he unceremoniously handed them to me. Insult to injury, they were for a single bed! The following my husband and 14 year old son had breakfast. For poor quality food and a cereal and orange juice for my son he was charged E17.50. The suite was a fine size and very clean and bright. Too near the busy main road for a good night's sleep. The little kitchenette was very handy for water, juice etc. Could be a great place to stay but lack of attention to detail lets it down. i would like to add that we requested an early check-in and this was facilitated with no fuss.",3,2012,05,22
249,Wouldnt Advice a stay here....,"I was looking for a nice , decent hotel on the outskirts of the city for a family night away. I had stayed in the clarion before but this one. So I thought 4star, great hotel, my husband and daughter would love it. I was wrong.
Firstly at Check in I had to pay in full and 100euro deposit because I was paying with Visa Debit ( a bit excessive) I wasn't told this on booking ,luckily I had the cash on me.Then, I had requested a cot in the room, when it arrived to our room and my husband tried to assemble it, it was broken. 
There was an old TV ( not flat screen)
The beds were so uncomfortable, the floor would have been a better choice and last but not least, there was NO Air Con, I know in Ireland it is not needed 90% of the time but the room was exceptionally warm and stuffy ,We had a fan !! yes a fan!! that had to stay on night. Hardly the standard you would expect from a 4* star hotel.  On check we had to wait 10/15 mins for the receptionist to retrieve our 100 euro deposit. All in all , I can say it was not a pleasant experience and I would not advise a stay here. ",2,2012,05,22
249,Value for money,"To be fair to this Clarion, its good value for money, a comfortable stay, and has everything you need. Made the most of the gym, the Asian restaurant is excellent and for me, gave the best service of the hotel, and it has the shopping centre 10 minute walk away. If you go there, have a burger from ""Moo"" - amazing! 

Bad points: No iron or ironing board in the room although it was meant to and then took an age to get one brought up and the hotel is not just a for guests hotel, it has a lot of functions too so when we ate, twice was in the bar area! 

Taxis: 32 euros from the airport. 15-20 euros to the city centre in the day and 25-30 euros in the late evening coming back. You can get a 3 day bus pass for just a tad less than 15euros but the bus stop if a good 15 minute walk from the hotel (And my partner had heels on - not ideal!!)

Overall a comfortable stay but i do kind of wish i had stayed in the centre!! 

1 more thing - i agree this is NOT a 4* hotel!! Comfortable and value for money but not 4*",3,2012,05,21
249,Basically good but improvements necessary,"The facilities at this hotel are pretty good, but the same can't be said of the staff. There were usually too few staff in reception (leading to delays whether checking in or requiring assistance), and slow and sometimes slipshod service in dining areas was common (the bar service was particularly poor - we were completely ignored for nearly half an hour on one occasion). We had to wait for cleaning to be completed several times. To top it off, we were hurried out of our room on our final morning by an extremely rude member of the cleaning staff who left us with the distinct impression we were an inconvenience to her. There was a often lack of basics like milk and teaspoons at breakfast, and dirty cups / dishes weren't unusual. Parking is expensive and not always available (and a part was removed from our hire car while parked there). Thin walls and noisy pipes in our area meant we could hear much more detail about neighbour's activities than we'd have liked. Room well appointed (cold, working fridge was a real bonus) and comfortable, but the lack of air conditioning is very odd in this day and age. Basically this would be a very good place to stay with some improvements in facilities and a drastic overhaul of the staff's attitude and professionalism.",3,2012,05,21
249,Very Disappointing,"Stayed here for a weekend away the end of April. Reception staff were very unfriendly. The television wasn't working in the room - rang for help - an hour later ( after five phonecalls to the desk) a very poorly dressed manager arrived to the door. He did fix the television but wasn't in anyway sincere about it. Also, the skirting board in the room was falling apart and extremely damp. Old dinners, empty bottles and rubbish were left along the corridors outside the rooms for hours on end - disgusting. Booked dinner for the saturday evening - food was good but again the reception was very poor. Overall experience - very disappointing. My advice- avoid this Hotel in the future.",1,2012,05,21
249,A four star hotel?!? I wouldn't board a dog here.,"This hotel is a disgrace. First of all they lost our reservation so we had to make a new one when we arrived. Given that we were travelling with a young child in need of sleep we were quite distressed because we weren't sure if there was a room available.

Neither on the booking site nor at the hotel was it made clear to us that the hotel swimming pool was undergoing renovation. As this was a primary reason for staying at this hotel it does seem lik it was an issue that should have been raised at the outset. There was a small notice on one desk away to the side, but it was insufficient given that (a)we had already booked and nowhere on the website did it make reference to the closure, (b)the notice was so small that you could only really see it if you were right up against it. The substitute option of using a diry, overcrowded and facility poor local swimming pool was not a reasonable replacement.

Secondly, the staff were rude. The bar staff particularly, every order was greeted with a sigh as if it was too much work for them to pour a drink or two. At reception we asked how to get to Glendalough and were given a map of the entire island of Ireland, told to go to the N81 and find our own way from there.

Its the first four star hotel I've ever stayed in where there was no minibar. This meant either having to go to the unfriendly bar every time we wanted a drink or having to drive to Lucan to Tesco to buy what we wanted for our room.

Also, the staff delivering food and drink to other rooms at other times of the day and night make it impossible to sleep.

All in all, a disgrace of a hotel. To top it all off, having written in complaint to the hotel citing all these problems, they just ignored my letter.",1,2012,05,18
249,Hated It - Location is Beyond Terrible,"The walls were paper thin, so you could hear everything going on in the corridors and in your neighbours room. The porter was nowhere to be found upon checking in so I ended up carrying my own bags to my room. The location was the worst, it really wasn't easy to get around and I eventually changed hotels to be closer to the tourist spots. Another problem was the number of children running around, I could only access wifi through the lobby, bar or restaurant and at no point was it a ""relaxed"" experience. Would not recommend this spot to anyone.",1,2012,05,17
249,Great stay,"We stayed here over the Bank Holiday weekend in May and it was an excellent visit.  We booked one of the one bed apartments in the hotel and were pleasantly surprised by the size of both the sitting room and bed-room.  We had 2 of our kids with us and they stayed on the pull out double bed couch.  There were TV's in both rooms although only 1 remote.  We didnt eat there as we brought our own food for the room as there was a small kitchenette there with most things you would need.
The staff were very good gave us everything we asked for, the swimming pool staff were very polite, friendly and helpful.
Great place to stay, will definitely go back again.  I still think charging for parking is a bit much but hey its not expensive",5,2012,05,14
249,Definitely not a true 4 star hotel!,"While the hotel is generally acceptable, like many other reviews mention, it is definitely not 4 star worthy. The room was clean enough; however, the lack of temperature control in the 21st Century is unbelievable. A portable fan? Seriously?!? I think what I found most disagreeable was a majority of the staff and their inattentiveness to detail. As an example, housekeeping would remove used bath items such as towels but wouldn't replace them and it took several contacts with reception to have any brought. Similarly, toiletries and coffee / tea supplies weren't properly replenished.  Also, the staff of the restaurant, with the exception of one East Indian woman who was quite polite, was horrible, bordering on offensive. It is poorly located if the main purpose of your trip is Dublin city centre, and what you will spend on cabs negates any savings on the room. It was approximately  20 Euros each way to city centre.",3,2012,05,13
249,excellent value,I stayed here recently with my husband. overall it was a pleasant stay. Room was very clean and spacious. Staff were very friendly and helpfull. Its location was excellent with lots of shops nearby to visit. We will return.,5,2012,05,12
249,"Clean, comfortable modern hotel","I only stayed overnight and for a few hours but the staff were welcoming and the room was spotless.

Fantastic, powerful shower.",4,2012,05,12
249,Nice hotel but pool safety poor,"We went for a two night family break with two children, they loved it, The hotel was clean and reasonable.
A fault with the fire alarm left us up for two hrs with our youngest afraid to go back to sleep but after a discussion with the manager I was reassured the fault was fixed, a lovely mgr to deal with. 

Being a lifeguard myself, my biggest concern was the pool, I cannot stress how dangerous it was, the water was cloudy for the three days I swam there, i was told a lifeguard isn't always on duty but when it's busy there is, the sun morn I was there it was very busy and a bit crazy, there was teenagers bomb diving in shallow water near other kids, small children totally unattened n deep water. After contacting reception a LG came to the side of the pool for 2mins and told me no one was on to cover the pool. Parents need to be VERY vigilant in this pool.",3,2012,05,09
249,lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay, staff very freindly, clean, pool warm,Room not to warm not to cold just right.
Easy to find and park.Will go back.",4,2012,05,09
249,great value,"I stayed in the hotel last week, great location just of the motorway with a large carpark. Staff were very helpfull at front desk at check in, I had arrived  early and didnt expect my room to be ready, i was very tired after a long flight so the girl on the front desk arranged an early check in for me! i was very gratefull, she realy went the extra mile for me. The room was spotless and a good size with a comfy bed. I had dinner in the restaurant that evening which was well priced. Breakfast was good the next morning, great choice. I didnt make it into the gym or pool due to my time constraints , but looked well equiped and the pool was good size",4,2012,05,08
249,Loved it Again!,"3rd time in last 2 years we have been to this hotel. Great value and wondeful hotel still. We went for the bigger room this time which was great as we could watch tv when the kids went to bed in the sepearte living room area. The pool is still the big winner with the kids but the new playground also went down a treat.
Had dinner in bar on both nights, good choice & really nice. Breakfast was V.busy on both mornngs so my advice is to have breakfast early before the rush.
Overall we had great time, excellent value, staff were great,especialy the guys in the leisure club who could'nt have been more helpful and we will definetly back",5,2012,05,05
249,Terrible place to stay,"Stayed in this hotel on 29th April.  Could not believe how bad it was, firstly, the bathroom was filthy, toilet not cleaned and blocked by previous user.  Faeces on toilet, towels used by another guest.  Magazine in room had phlem on it, disgusting experience.  Decided to have a meal that evening, things just got worse.  Asked for gluten free food was told it was not a problem, the staff did not know what gluten free was, brought out brown bread with smoked salmon despite the fact the waitress was told enough times.  Ordered duck for main course got some sort of bird definately not duck, it would have been difficult for a duck to stand on the leg that I was given.  Black meat still did not identify what bird it was.  My husband ordered Steak was told it would be five euro extra, he could not cut the meat it was so grisley, so we decided to finish and leave the restaurant totally disgusted and disappointed.  How many more things could have gone wrong.  At 4.30am the fire alarm goes off, no instructions from night staff on what to do and no apology from hotel the next morning, is that good customer relations or what? We were in room 649, can you imagine what you should do if their was a real fire.  Overall this hotel was a disgrace to the Tourism industry in Ireland!",1,2012,05,01
249,Great weekend,"The room was fantastic, spotless and very spacious. There was great activites for the kids and the pool was the highlight of their trip, the food is amazing and the staff are so friendly. Checking in was so easy and the receptionist was very helpful. I recommend this hotel to families as it's near so many locations..liffey valley shopping centre, the cinema, the zoo and there are buses that take you right to the city centre outside the shopping centre. Really great value",5,2012,05,01
249,Another Great Stay!,"Having stayed at this hotel again, I felt I should comment about this stay!  Myself and my husband and two children stayed at the hotel last weekend.  After a speedy check-in, we were given a lovely family room for our stay.  The rooms are a great size and most importantly are spotless clean.  We had dinner from the Kudos menu, which was really tasty and is a huge hit with my husband!  Our children love this hotel because of the pool and the childrens play room.  Breakfast is really lovely, with a huge choice suitable for everyone.  My son is a fussy eater and the staff were on hand and were very friendly and helpful to us.  I love this hotel and you just cant beat it for good value and superb location.  Liffey Valley shopping centre is a stones throw which is so handy for the cinema and shopping.  Can't fault this hotel for family value and customer service.  We will be back again!!  Thank you!",5,2012,05,01
249,Rubbish,"I've stayed in probably over 100 hotels down the years, in different parts of the world. I have never written a review but felt moved to do so after my recent stay at the Clarion. I stayed here three years ago and enjoyed my stay, things have obviously changed since.

1. The majority of staff are as cold as ice.
2. Bedrooms are like saunas.
3. False fire alarms go off at 4.30am. The hotel decline he opportunity to apologise to guests for this.
4. Eating their over-priced breakfast is like eating cardboard.
5. If you do not own a credit card you will be hit with a €100 room damage deposit when checking-in. Debit cards cannot be used as security due to the possibility of you having no money in the bank, This charge does not even entitle you to a bar or restaurant tab.
6. When you request a room containing a double and a single you are only provided with a room containing a double.",1,2012,04,29
249,Just ok could improve in areas,"This hotel was ok the rooms was suppose to be non smoking and the smell of smoke was awful, it even had cigarette marks on locker burnt marks which i told the staff, we had booked 2 nights but booked a different times cleaners never changed the sheets , very few towels in bathroom, Breakfast was good ,
Mad prices to pay 4 euro per DAY to park there , i have 3  rooms  booked for july im thinking of changing to another hotel , left 2 tea bags in room for 24 hours , could have done better, the pool was not warm water and as for the showers they were frezzing cold in fact we jumped out of them after the pool, The floor was slippy i seen a lady fall in the changing room, Ou room was a long way from reception , the shopping center was only up the road was nice , the chair in the room was dirty i have pictures , they didnt offer me a new room at any time i told them,",3,2012,04,25
249,Budget Hotel,"My cousins and I chose this hotel because it was inexpensive and one of my cousins had a limited budget.  I would have preferred to stay in City Centre.  But the hotel was fine, nothing fancy or nice about it.  It was close to the bus stop and a quick bus ride to City Centre (maybe less than 10 min).  There was a mall across the street which was nice, we did go to the movies there and the theater was actually nice and the chairs roomy.  Back to the hotel, the room was suitable since we were hardly in it, they were able to put three beds in it which was great.  They did have a pool, with a hot tub and sauna, but they hold swimming lessons for children there and it was incredibly loud.",3,2012,04,23
249,V Basic/Noisy and poor breakfast service,"V Basic and please note rooms are quite a walk from the reception.  As it's a conference hotel, you will get lots of noise from others late at night.  A lack of respect we found when staying here.  Poor service, wanted some more towels- they never came.  There is nothing to do around here apart from the shopping centre.

Breakfast was basic and poor to be honest.  Lots of waiters/waitresses cleaning but no one asking if we wanted tea/coffee which should be the first thing asked.

Save your money and stay elsewhere.",1,2012,04,22
249,"basic, you get what you pay for","we stayed in a family room for 1 night. Overall the room was ok, clean and basic, beds where comfy enough, the bathroon had a bath with a shower over it. The room was on the ground floor and although it was generally quiet, there will always be the guests that don't respect others and make noise late at night. 
The leisure center was great, the water warm, the changing rooms where clean and plenty of room in them, the staff in the leisure where very helpful, i had no swimming hat and in most hotels you would sold one but here is was given one. 
Excellant location beside the shopping center, we drove to the park and ride at the red cow, paid €2 for four hours parking and travelled into the city center for €10.10 (that was for two adults and one child). very resonable considering the price of parking in the city center. 
Would stay here again.",4,2012,04,21
249,Weekend break,"Having just stayed at this hotel for a conference  I can say the hotel is lovely but something is lacking, staff are effecient but not very friendly and waiting staff in restaruant did not seem to know what they were doing. Rooms were big and well equipped but no toileteries in the bathroom at all, no shower cap, no body lotion etc. A few wee extras would make all the difference to this hotel. Great parking facilities but no one tells you if you are a guest in the hotel the parking is free if you ask at reception for a ticket. Not much to do locally but a very good shopping centre within walking distance and apparently a hop on hop off bus tour is available from the hotel. Would recommend this hotel but think they could make it so much better with a few small changes.",3,2012,04,21
249,"Dirty, noisy & disappointing","We stayed there last weekend with our 2 year old, main intention was to go to the zoo and do some shopping. Location was easy to find & close (driving) to zoo & (walking) to shopping centre. Hotel was located just off a business park and had no outdoor landscaping or areas that you could even consider to be nice to look at, just an undeveloped site on one side, motorway on another, halting site and car dealership to complete the scene.

When we checked in, the rooms were still being cleaned and rather than a few being done at a time, it seemed as though most of the floor was being done and as a result, the halls were full of garbage bags (one was tipped over and used teabags and uht milk pots were on the carpet), laundry bags, and service carts.  We dropped our luggage off and went to get a bite to eat in the bar, and when we came back, it was obvious that the hall hadn't been vacuumed, there was a sugar lump in our door way and it was just dirty in general.

We then went for dinner in the hotel, which was included in the package.  The menu was limited, but reasonable. Service was poor. We were with another couple and their 1 year old. The waitress scowled at us when asked to bring some hot water to heat the baby's bottle. My daughter spilled some water on her highchair tray which I drained off into an empty glass and the tray had clearly not been cleaned recently as the water was milky. The food then arrived and while the salmon I ordered was quite nice, my husband's chicken was dry and tasteless. Next to no veg was given with the dinner unless you ordered separately. Salmon came with one asparagus spear and about a large tablespoon worth of mashed potato. Chicken had two small carrots and same potato.  Chocolate cake for dessert was gorgeous though!

As we were there with our little girl & we were back in the room fairly early, she went down around 9.00 and we tried to go to sleep around 10. Beds were hard. Then, worse, we could hear every word in the next room (even though they weren't shouting). Very disruptive. I put a call in to reception who said that they would ask them to keep it down. Heard the phone ring and the man was not impressed with being asked to pipe down but did, for a few minutes at least. About 15 mins later, I had to put in another call and explained that while the next room weren't exactly throwing a rave, we could hear everything going on and it was disruptive. Security was sent to the room, heard the door being opened. After security left, they stopped talking for a while and proceeded to open and shut all the cupboards for a while and we even heard the toilet seat being lifted and dropped. By 11, they had a few more drinks into them and the conversation was loud again. I got dressed and went to reception. We were moved to a larger room. Settled back down to sleep and thankfully didn't have any noisy neighbours, but still could hear people going back to their rooms and doors opening/closing. Oh, and as I discovered the following morning, there was pink mold on the grout of most of the tiles around the bath. Gave a section a quick scrub to see was it mold or just staining but it easily came away so obviously hadn't been properly cleaned in a long time.

The following morning, we had breakfast, which was alright. A lot of the glasses were quite dirty though. We went early to the Zoo, which was very close by and easy to get to even though we weren't familiar with the city. We went back to the hotel early that afternoon as both kids needed naps. We went for what was supposed to be a quick sandwich at the bar and spaghetti & meatballs for our daughter. One of the sandwiches took 25 mins to arrive to the table and 10 mins after placing the order, we were told that there was no sauce or pasta to accompany  the meatballs so had to order something else. Very fed up at this stage. That evening, for dinner we went to a restaurant in the nearby mall.

On checking out the following morning, we were only too glad to be able to leave. Complained to the manager about the poor standards and our disappointment in the stay. We had expected 4star and got at best 3. We don't get away often and this was supposed to be a nice family getaway. We've stayed in plenty of hotels around the world over the years and this was by far the biggest let down of all. We definitely won't be staying again and I'd be very hesitant to consider a Clarion again.",1,2012,04,16
249,2012 no AC ?,"Stayed in Liffey valley clarion hotel during busy easter break with my family , our first hotel overnight with our youngest 9 month old. Overall hotel room was clean , modern but was curious of fan in corner of the room when I first entered . Also the heat was also concerning , found out fan was to keep room temp below boiling as the tiny window and no air conditioning didn't help , I asked in reception was our room the only one in joking and was told no rooms have ac ? , amazing . It was April and I felt we were half cooked alive during our stay , it has to be unbearable in summer with a temp outside. It has to be possibly the only but fatal fault with this hotel , ashame really due to mostly room , food , pool being good value.",2,2012,04,15
249,Family suite,"Stayed this time in the family suite. It's got a double bedroom & a living room that turns into another bedroom. Good size bedroom. Living area has double bed (pull out couch) & room for a fold up bed. 

There's no air con & the windows only open a little so the heat can be unbearable if the weather is warm. 

The tv in the living room didn't work but as we had another one in the bedroom I didn't ring down. 

I didn't find the reception staff pleasant in fact I was told I'd no booking & that the hotel was fully booked! Only for my booking to be found & NO APOLOGY!

Besides those negatives the location & facilities makes it hard to find as good. ",4,2012,04,14
249,Good value for money,"Our family of 5 stayed here over the easter break. Great value for money... close proximity to a great shopping centre and has a pool which is always an advantage with kids. I would say that you get what you pay for, it was reasonably priced and everything was of a reasonable standard. Would go back again for another stay. Only issue I would have is that I cant find any pics of their appartments on the website and would not book one without having an idea of what they are like.",4,2012,04,14
249,So Poor They Charged Me Twice !,"We stayed at this hotel in January. When we went to the room at about 3pm we found it to be very cold. I looked for a temperature control on the walls and on the radiator itself but could find none. When I went to reception I was told that the heating would not come on until 4pm. I can understand hotels trying to cut costs but this is ridiculous in January. Even when the heating came on there was still no option to turn it lower or higher ! The cooked breakfast in the morning was poor, not helped by running out of eggs. 
            However my main concern followed a month after our stay. On arriving at the hotel I had paid the bill in Euros as I had quite a few following a previous trip. On our departure I checked out and there was no further charges to pay. The hotel had been booked through laterooms and they ask for credit/debit card details as a form of insurance. Over a month after our stay the hotel bill was taken from our card without any notification from the hotel or laterooms. E-mails were sent to the hotel but were unanswered. Laterooms to their credit did take the matter up and contacted the hotel several times. It still took over a week for the money to be returned to the account and yet no reason or apology has been received.",1,2012,04,11
249,Not Impressed,"just stayed in this hotel for the night.when booking the hotel i was booking for myself,my partner and our 2 kids,4 and 2. was offered a room with a double bed and 2 singles with breakfast for 99euro.thought this was a good rate.after booking i was looking through their website to show the kids their pictures etc when i spotted the ad for every room every nite 59euro.wen i rang i got spoken to as if i was quite stupid and told that is room only and is for a room you have booked a family suite which is bigger and more suitable.so i said ok leave it as it is. a family suite???if that was a suite then i wouldnt like to see a standard room,not alot of space,no different to any other hotel rooms we have stayed in,and as i have seen others saym,the heat was unreal during the nite,not very comfortable.have to say the kids loved the pool,great leisure facility provided. very unfirendly and unhelpful staff,wen checking in i was told if paying by cash i had to provide 100euro as a an extra deposit.cudnt use debit card or they wud just charge thru this and we wudnt b able to pay in cash-none of this was explained wen booking. staff were quite rude.the only nice member of staff we came across was a gentleman in the kudos bar/restaurant wen we ate shotrly afte check in on the saturday.breakfast facility very standard and average-they didnt even provide apple juice-every b&b and hotel i have ever stayed in has at least provided a couple of different types of breakfast juice!some of plates/cutlery and childs high chair were filthy-had to ask for high chair to be cleaned!!also was very very noisy on the floor we stayed on rite up until about 1am-people coming and going,our youngest didnt sleep very well due to the noise!!we defintely wont be staying here EVER AGAIN!!!",3,2012,04,10
249,Never Again!,"Myself and my husband and 3 year old son have just returned from our Easter stay at the Clarion Liffey Valley and never again ! On arrival there were 3 queues out the door to check in  - once we did we were upgraded to a ""suite"", not sure why but it was not what I expected ! The sink in the bathroom was blocked and was smelly, the TV was not working and there was a sofa bed provided for my son. When I opened it, it was impossible to open it fully for proper use so at 3pm I rang reception and explained the 3 issues I had. I was told to unplug the TV, this always happens, and someone would be up right away to deal with the other issues.At 5:30 I rang again same story but was told that the sofa bed is broken in that room and will be replaced ! We left the room at 6:30pm for dinner and still no sign  - after dinner we returned to the room and a single bed had been left all made up for my son which was great except that they left the broken couch there and the sink was still blocked ! My dinner was fine - can't go wrong with steamed salmon but my husbands steak was cold and it was followed up with a cold expresso ! Some dining staff were lovely, others a bit blunt. The pool was very disapponting dark and very slippery, not great ! But to top it all off - I got a wake up call at 4am telling me my taxi was outside and another call at 7am - we had booked neither ! So a relaxing full nights sleep was out of the question ! We were booked in for 2 nights and left after 1 - had a lovely day at the zoo and kept on driving ! Too many customers for too little staff maybe is what has gone wrong here - never again !",1,2012,04,10
249,Great family stay,"Hi stayed here over easier,there were lots of kiddie things to do playroom movies and pool all good also Easter egg hunt on Easter Sunday, good value good location suites are reasonable and offer a bedroom and living area which is great when away means you don't have to go to bed same time as the kids overall great family stay , anytime we asked for anything it was delivered all good would recommend it to families and couples not far from zoo , Liffey valley and city",4,2012,04,10
249,Disappointing for a Clarion,"A colleague and I spent a night here whilst attending a workshop in Dublin. I felt the price for the room was resonable and it was convenient to where we wanted to be. The overall decor in the hotel was nice however the beds inour room weren't and the room was extremely hot. No individual climate control - however there was a fan in the room which was a lifesaver that evening. The other positive was the nice hairdryer in the room - one that actually dries hair in under two hours! I was really disappointed a the toiletries - those wall hung dove generic shower and gel things in one. What four star hotel does not provide some shampoo, shower gel, maybe some body lotion and some soap for the handbasin. I would expect that in a three star hotel but ot a four. The hotel is also quite noisy - poor soundproofing meant we could hear noises from above and this combined with the heat and uncomfortable beds all made for a very poor nights sleep. Breakfast the following morning was good and I met one friendly waiter who seemed to be the happiest person on staff! The Receptionist who checked us out the following morning was friendly and efficient and upon telling her of a very badly stained chair in our room, apologised and said she would get housekeeping onto it. I have stayed in many hotels and have to say that this one does not deserve its four stars. Maybe we just got the ""bum room"" but even so, simply not good enough.",3,2012,04,07
249,"Great Value, Fab Grub","I stayed here for a weekend with my wife & 3 kids, staff were very friendly and made us feel at home.  Kids loved the swimming pool, while wife was delighted with near proximity to shopping heaven. Great location, great value and super food. Wel worth a visit.",4,2012,03,27
249,Started out as a great hotel but gone downhill a little,Stayed in the clarion a number of times. Each time was good however it needs some refurbishment. Staff can be a little unfriendly at times. Bar food was always excellent lived the Thai slant but don't think it's something they offer anymore. Good hotel but be careful of room choice,3,2012,03,20
249,Good decent hotel,"I stayed here with my husband and 2 year old daughter for a week.  It is a great location, not a far walk to restaurants and the mall.  The hotel was priced great -- we had an apartment like set up with a separate bedroom and a kitchen with microwave, etc.  The pros:
Location, comfortable room, clean bathroom, had good amenities for our room for a longer stay (washer/dryer, microwave, refrigerator)
Cons: sink had an odd smell, they didn't provide soap for the kitchen, or washer/dryer ( i would think they would at least provide a small amount of it), couch in living room was uncomfortable

Overall though, it was a good experience and if we have to stay for an extended period of time, this is a good place.",3,2012,03,16
249,RBS 6 Nations rugby trip,"Had two night for short break in Dublin. Wasn't exactly sure how far it was out of city and on arrival released that it was quite a bit. In saying that you can get a bus close by for 2.65 euro and it takes about 15 mins to get into the centre. Got a bus back late on on Saturday evening from city however it went into a few of the rougher suburbs on the way out which worried myself slightly. A taxi costs between 25 - 28 euro into centre from hotel. On arrival I noted a bad smell in the reception and along the corridor of the ground floor which worried me however the room on the first floor was fine. It was clean and tidy however the double bed was two singles pushed together. I noted that the smell wasn't present on the second day. The bar was fairly expensive and I didn't eat at the hotel do can't say either way if it's good or not. There are two restaurants beside the hotel, The Arc which is. Bar serving burgers steaks etc and The Lemongrass which is an Asian restaurant which was very good. Overall not bad value or money for accommodation plus it has a car park which is only 4 euro a day but it wouldn't be what I would rate ad a 4 star.",3,2012,03,13
249,Great hotel for the price,"Stayed for 2 nights at the clarion Liffey valley. Great hotel at great price €59 per night. Room was clean a little cold but was ok. Great location only took 5 mins to the city centre by car. Leisure centre was lovely too. We didn't eat at the hotel , had a drink in the bar wasn't very inviting but ok for one after a night out . Check in was easy room was ready early.",4,2012,03,07
249,For €59 a night it's the best you will get,Great hotel for the price the only flaw was the amount of chlorine in the jacuzzi. It was not possible to sit in it if you value your eyes other than that everything was perfect for the price.,3,2012,03,06
249,okay for price but not a 4 star rating,Recently had a one night stay at the clarion the hotel itself was nice  and the rooms where cleans and spacious. We booked in for dinner as it was included in our package. The restaurant was ok food was very average. The next morning we got breakfast to the room and it came late and was cold. We requested a late check-out as my partner wanted to use the gym facilities and at 11.58 a knock came to the door to see where we checking out as the room needed to be cleaned I told the lady that we had requested a late check out her reply was very rude as she said she would have to check that . I will not be rushing back,3,2012,03,05
249,"Okay for price, not great for a 4*","Stayed here for three nights mid-week for work purposes.

Got a good rate, minus breakfast so cannot comment on that aspect (15E for 1 breakfast so needless to say I ventured across the road where a full-irish cost 6.95E)
Check-in was efficient.
Car park cost 4E per 24 hour period (with a machine so each time you leave the hotel your ticket requires validating) Bit of a pain!
The room was clean (not immaculate) with lots of space, although there was no temperature control within the room so it was by no means warm (kept my coat on for an hour) This however improved as the evening went on.
The room had all the necessary basics but certainly not to the standard of a four star hotel. Toiletries were particularly poor. Mini-bar was empty. Rooms are not sound-proofed.",3,2012,02,28
249,good place,"I stayed here for a week 12th Feb( Mid term from school + Valentines Day) and found the hotel and staff excellent.Check in was painless thanks Shannon, i had my evening meal in the bar which has an excellent menu,service here was quick and staff very nice. I have never slept in on an any Business trip but did on two morns,so i can only say the beds a very comfortable, the rooms are very clean.4euro for overnight parking.
I will certainly be back on a family break,",4,2012,02,19
249,Great break.,"We stayed here after much debate over location. We decided to stay outside the city centre for a change as we had been to Dublin many times and really just wanted time to be together as a couple.
It was a great choice, the room was well made up, comfortable and very clean. Our room was missing a hairdryer but we contacted reception and they sent one up within minutes. 
The restaurant for breakfast was buffet style and there was great choice, you could also ask for any extras that weren't readily available like a boiled egg etc.
We also chose to eat in the Kudos restaurant both nights as the food was fantastic. They also did a meal deal there which was 19.95 euro each for a 2 course meal and cinema ticket. Great value as a cinema ticket is 10.85 euro. 
We went to the health suite which was pretty overrun with kids and as we were on a break to get away from our we didn't enjoy. Perhaps it would benefit from set times when it's adults only. They also require you to wear a swim cap which you can purchase for 3 euro. A bit of a con when the cap is fabric and not rubber!!
There is a shopping centre about a 5 minute walk away with a number of different restaurants and cafes in if you don't want to eat at the hotel and the Vue cinema is in there too.
It's about 30 minutes from Dublin on the bus so still accessible and if you are going direct to the hotel from the airport there is a bus which is 10 euro return or 9 euro single.",4,2012,02,15
249,Good value for business trip,"I stayed here 1 night on business and found the following:
1. Check in was efficient. 
2. Room was modern and clean and comfortable. (cost 59 Euros)
3. Food in the restaurant was good and tasty. Starters cost approx 6 Euros and mains approx 13 Euros but the beer was expensive with a pint of Guinness costing 6 Euros. 
4. Breakfast was a good selection of cooked and cold food.  
5. Parking downstairs is 4 Euros for 24 hours. 
I would stay here again.",4,2012,02,14
249,Will not be staying here again,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for one night last Saturday. Upon check in, we were met with a very unfriendly girl on reception. Because we were paying by cash, we had to give 100 euro deposit for security reasons and show photo ID. We were not told this at time of booking. I had to run back down to the underground car park to get my driving license out of the car, in which I had to queue for the lift for the car park, how frustrating
When we got to the room, we noticed there was no hairdryer in the room so we had to ring down for one which was brought up by a member of staff
The room also advertises a double bed, but really its just 2 single beds pulled together. Overall I was not happy with this hotel and will not be returning",1,2012,02,13
249,mean hotel policy.,my son stayed here for one night and had to pay on arrival plus 100 euro security deposit because he didnt have a credit card. There is no word of this when you are booking. just dont want other people to get caught out and leave themselves 100 euro short for the night. would definately not use this hotel again,1,2012,02,12
249,Average Hotel,"We stayed here in 2011 in the spring. The food was overpriced, beds were average and the place was so overpriced. I remember paying €12 for two drinks in the bar which is sinful. It was cheap enough stay but I dont think I would stay again. There is much nicer places to stay in Ireland. The pool area is one of the most dead places I have ever been to also.",3,2012,01,31
249,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"This is by far the best hotel in Dublin. The best value at 59Euro a night (69 for family room) A Carvery Breakfast that is to die for, friendly staff that will do their best to help. It is a few years since I used their spa but it was good at the time and I see no reason why that would have changed. While they don't have a great childrens menu it is right next to the shopping centre which has all you could ask for. No matter what part of Dublin I am going to visit I always stay in Liffey Valley and have done for three years now since I first found out about this little gem. And very family friendly too, always lots of families there but yet they have a floor designated to that so as to not interfere with guests looking for a little quiet getaway.",5,2012,01,18
249,Awful Experience!,"We just arrived home from spending 2 nights in this hotel. The hotel itself was ok, the restaurant was nice and the pool was ok. However when we arrived at 3 pm we parked our car 8 spaces away from the entrance to the hotel. 2 hours later when we went outside the car had been broken into, and items stolen and the Locks were damaged. The hotel wanted nothing to do with the situation, and would not help out with the security cameras, which are all around the car park. When the police arrived, they told us this happens on a regular basis in the hotel car park, and that the hotel are doing nothing about it. The area itself was not very safe, and the guard warned us not to be walking around alone. My advice, its not worth safe staying here!!",1,2012,01,16
249,Return Visit,"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times on business. It really is excellent value for money - ""proper"" hotel quality at budget prices. Just try to avoid the basement rooms that have a view of a concrete wall.
My room this time was on the first floor so had a better view, albeit of the car park! The bedroom was spacious, comfortable and well equipped. The bathroom was strangely too big with an expanse of concrete tiles on the floor and numerous redundant stainless steel fittings around the washbasin - perhaps for non-existent toothbrush holder and soap dish?
Breakfast was included in my room rate so I wasn't going to miss out. There was the normal buffet breakfast fare. All the hot food was tasty and hot although I have to say that the tomato ketchup was probably among the worst I've tasted. The orange juice was also pretty disgusting. The ""selection of artisan breads"" mentioned on the menu was a basket of petit pain white rolls - very nice but not quite as promised.
Overall this hotel is still great value for money and I shall be returning.",4,2012,01,16
249,value for money,"Excellent value for money and ideally located for access. Staff very helpful and pleasant unlike some places I have stayed. Great atmosphere and buzz around the place, would return any time.",5,2012,01,10
249,New years eve,"myself and my partner stayed in the clarion liffey valley as a new years treat. On arrival the hotel was busy but the reception staff were friendly and efficient. 
Our room was clean, warm but not very big. We had a lovely meal in the kudos bar, staff were friendly and helpful. 
after dinner we went up to the pegasus suite for new years eve party and had a great night ringing in the new year. I look forward to next new years to do it all over again in the clarion.",4,2012,01,09
249,"Good location, suitable for families","Have stayed here quite a few times,  always try here first, family rooms get booked up quick.
It can get very busy in the morning at breakfast, so if you wake ea rly - get up and get breakfast.There is a good selection at breakfast. We had a meal included one night and it was lovely portion size was good as we were full after it. There is a 'kids club' but not supervised as we have been to smaller hotels and they have had excellent supervised kids clubs. We had to stay with the kids while toy story was on, if kids club is on they should have it set up a bit better and supervised with sign in/out especially with the amount of families that are always there.
Another issue was the heat in the bedrooms at night it was that awful dead heat that makes you drowsy in the morning, tossed and turned all night. The room in general was fine, the beds were fine and the bathroom/tv/tea making facilities were all fine, there was a vending machine at the end of the corridor also. 
The swimming pool can also get busy but had a great selection of kids toys for afternoon kids pool time.
Overall its a good location and good value",4,2012,01,08
249,Wonderful stay,"Stayed here with the family after Christmas before the kids went back to school and really had an excellent time. Great Leisure centre with huge pool, had dinner on both nights which was really great on both nights and found the asian menu to be the best. Found the hotel an ideal spot for the few days as only 15 mins from city centre and 5 mins walk from huge shopping centre and movie theatre. Overall we found it great value & the kids are already asking when we are going back.",5,2012,01,07
249,okay hotel,went on new years eve.2 families.got great deal.but when we arrived at hotel we knew it was going to be busy.queue for reception was out the door even though there was at least 4 on reception.when we got to top of queue there seemed to be a problem with both bookings not enough family rooms.good start but to be fair to the young lady on reception she was very good to us.she offered to show us their suites which are ajacent to hotel which looking around us was prob not a bad idea.suites were spacious with 2 big doubles 1 ensuite they provided us with 3 fold out single beds for kids which we put in the huge sittingroom.how could we complain when the price we paid for new years eve was great.have to agree with other reviews but everyone to their own.im sure hotel is not  that bad usually.also location is quite good beside shopping centre.i would reccomend to people maybe for 1 or 2 nights but no more.could be too far from city centre for some people,4,2012,01,06
249,Friendly efficient staff,"Stayed here recently on a shopping trip to the sales.  Check in staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. The room was lovely, very clean and spacious. Ate in the restaurant and food was of really good quality and service excellent.  Hotel is very well situated for shopping and great value for money.  Will be staying there again.",5,2012,01,06
249,Traumatised....then I had to pay for the car park!,Was looking forward to staying in a nice hotel to ring in the new year with my family from the moment we arrived to when we checked out it was our worst nightmare. I cannot believe the staff & Duty Manager closed their eyes to the carry on I witnessed. Parents were drunk ignoring the behaviour of their children and the bar kept serving them while toddlers were running around at 3 in the morning. It was clear to see there was no supervision people were carrying SHOPPING BAGS full of alcohol into the lounge and around the hotel all evening. Food was being ordered from local take aways into peoples rooms and then flung into the corridors. There was an argument in the lobby and a security guard took out his phone and told the woman to tell someone who gave a f**k when she tried to complain...NICE!! I could go on about the fight I witnessed outside or the vomit I walked into but what's the point it is obvious the hotel staff & Management accept a rough class of people and just want their money. I just wish I knew before I stayed there to add insult to injury after paying for the room and food & drinks ( when otheres brought their own) I had to pay for the car park...Never again...Don't stay here unless you want to be kept awake by screaming & shouting!!!,1,2012,01,03
249,new years eve party,i stayed there last nite family room and have to say well done hotel staff u put a great nite on 4 families esp for kids u wouldnt get it any where else and price was great 59 my children want to go back tonite .IF KIDS R HAPPY SO R ADULTS .....,5,2012,01,01
249,Disgraceful,"We stayed here new years eve! It was the worst experience ever! First while we were checking in we were interrupted a few times by kids looking for change - customers checking in should be seen to first not have to wait! We went to room
And fair enough it was clean! The Halls were strewed with rubbish and trays of food left outside! These were still here when we came back to room about 2. We went for dinner ( not in hotel thank god) and returned to bar! This was full o kids running round and parents not taking care of them! We said we would go to other bar and went upstairs! What we found there was worse! We ended up sittin in foe where we were joined by another couple who were shocked at the
Xarry on! At the next table to us there was 9 people 4 adults 5 kids ordering pizza and bringing in cans of beer! The hotel had no ice and the beer was muck!There was so much noise in hotel that neither of us slept! Breakfast-tea and coffee cold! Really for a four star hotel I was disappointed and shocked that they let this carry on go! I know it is not in the nicest areas of Dublin but how it got it's stars is beyond me! We complained at check out and was told it was new years eve- tha is not an excuse! I stay in a lot of hotels for business purposes and never have witnesses what I did last nit! My company will not be using the clarion group ever again ! ",1,2012,01,01
249,Expected better !,"Although it seemed good value when booking ,this hotel disappointed us.I assumed it would be of a similar standard to Clarion,Cork which I loved.On the plus side the room was nice-bright and modern.Staff at reception were also friendly and helpful.However nothing else was good.Food in the restaurant at dinner time was quite poor.I ordered a chicken black bean dish which tasted only like salt,barely edible.My partner had a lasagne which was freezing cold in the middle.It took 30 minutes to produce a new one.We ordered some cocktails which were incorrectly made also.The swimming pool area was not at all up to usual hotel standard-it was run down and not very clean.Noise  from parties at the hotel made it difficult to sleep as could be heard in the bedroom until 2.30 am.We realized this hotel was a bit outside Dublin but didn't expect such a ugly area.In future I would rather pay more for a decent hotel.",3,2011,12,20
249,real value for money,Our family 2 adults and 2 kids stayed one night on a Lidl break 79 euro inc buffet breakfast fit for a king.We had a room with 1 double and 2 single beds+fridge and kettle and 20 sat channels really good.The leisure centre /pool was top notch and all the staff were lovely/helpful.We were filled with trepidation after reading some of my fellow tripadvisor reviews but after our stay i have to ask did they stay at the same hotel or what are they looking for @60 euro approx per night {buckingham palace?). Most complaints centre on late night noise hence i requested to be housed away from noise guess what NO NOISE was this a fluke or had my request been heeded we will never know but i will give the clarion the benefit of the doubt all in all couldnt fault hotel or staff and i suspect some of my fellow reviewers are really harsh and picky. ps its walking distance from liffey valley shopping centre.,5,2011,12,19
249,Noisy Christmas Parties,"We recently stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley as a shopping stop over. We had a good time up at the Liffey valley centre, particularly enjoying the Steak House and a night at the cinema. We returned to the hotel with our two children, had one drink and went up to the room for the night. At about 2:30 am the noise started and continued until about 4 am. Now, I understand it was a Christmas party but my only complaint is that the hotel could have segregated the normal guests from the Party night. It spoiled a otherwise nice stay. We enjoyed the leisure centre and the room was all the we needed and the rate was very good also. However, whne I and the customer in front of me complained at the desk on check out - we received a very poor response - it was party night, sorry. All I wanted was an apology and a committment to try and improve the issue but we got a shrug of the shoulders. We might be back just nowhere near Christmas.",2,2011,12,14
249,clarion hotel-great value/good location,"We stayed here for one night the beginning of december and really couldnt fault this hotel,rooms great,clean,roomy.breakfast reasonable price and great selection.carpark underground very secure,and great value for money.",4,2011,12,13
249,"It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't very good","We booked this hotel because we planned to do some Christmas shopping in the Liffey Valley shopping centre. We had planned to stay a week earlier than we did do but because of a blip to our plans we had to cancel that original date on the actual planned day of arrival. This wasn't a problem as the hotel had no issues with us changing to the following weekend & they didn't charge us a cancellation fee for the late cancellation of our original stay. We then ended up having to reduce the numbers on our booking & had to bring forward our stay by one day. Again, this wasn't a problem for the hotel & once more, they didn't charge us any fee for changing our booking. 
Once we finally got on our way we found the hotel very easily, not far off the N4 Sligo-Dublin Rd. No problems getting parked in the underground car park (cost 4 euros per day) which we went into rather than the surface car park. Up the lift to reception where I was surprised at the length of the queue for checking in which stretched right back to the entrance door. My first thought was that this could have been very easily avoided if the third check in point at the desk had been staffed rather than having just the two staff that were on duty. We tagged on to the back of the queue which moved fairly slowly & when we got to the front of the queue the tail of it still reached the door as other guests had arrived after us to check in (this seemed to be the norm as we saw queues of different lengths on several occasions as we passed through reception during our stay). Once we got to the desk, check in was okay with the only very minor delay caused by having to fill in a registration form. 
Our room was on the fourth floor & we had to use the lifts at the end of the corridor to access it rather than the lifts right behind reception. What a surprise when we opened the door & discovered that we still had a family suite, even after the changes to the size of our booking. The bedroom was big, clean & comfortable but felt a little aged & faded & in need of a freshen up. It had tv, work station/dresser, iron & ironing board, hairdryer, luggage rack, smoke alarm, twin beds, bedside lamps, safe, electric fan & plenty of clothes storage. The room was a perfect temperature heated by a radiator & trv, no air con. We had some issues with noise from the very busy road outside as, even when closed, the windows weren't up to the job of soundproofing the room. There was also a problem with a loose electrical socket which, considering it was a family suite, would be a major safety issue for a family with toddlers or very young children. I reported this at reception on checking out but really, it was something that the housekeeping staff should already have been aware of & should have had rectified before we or others had used the room.
Our sitting room was huge. Clean & very comfortable it had tv, dining table & chairs, work station, coffee table, sofa & armchairs, smoke alarm, electric fan & a kitchenette with tea/coffee, fridge, drinks cooler,kettle & sink. Like the bedroom, the temperature was perfect.
The bathroom was small, way out of proportion to the other rooms in the suite. It had bath, shower, shampoo/shower gel, liquid soap, shaving socket & extractor fan, so, everything you'd need apart from space.
We had an excellent dinner in the Sinergie Restaurant. Decor wise, the restaurant is fairly unremarkable but the food was good. Three courses with plenty of choice on the menu, everything was well cooked & nicely presented. The restaurant was busy but with plenty of good, friendly, attentive staff on duty there were no delays between courses.
Breakfast was served in the same restaurant. There was plenty to choose from with cereals, cold meats, cheese, yoghurts, fruit salad, grapefruit slices, full fry, croissants & pastries, toast, tea, coffee & fruit juices. Truth be told though, breakfast was dissappointing & bore no comparison to the quality of the dinner.The bacon & sausages were tasteless, the toast- cold & the orange drink was so diluted that it was only the colour which gave the hint of what it was supposed to be. 
We used the leisure centre which had a pool (constant depth of 1.4 mts), kids pool, jacuzzi, sauna & steamroom & towels were provided free of charge. The pool was nicely heated but as approx 25% of it was roped off for swimming lessons & 2 lanes were roped off for swimming lengths, there wasn't a huge amouunt of free space left.
As this review probably reads as fairly negative, I might as well add now that the timber slips around the glass of the firedoors, on the corridor outside of our room, were loose. I also mentioned this at reception on checking out but add this to the loose socket in our room & I would have reservations about how seriously the hotel take health & safety & housekeeping.
There were complimentary national newspapers at reception & there is an internet station in the foyer, costing 10 cents per minute. Vending machines with soft drinks, chocolate bars & snacks are located close to the lifts.
Checking out was much more pleasant than checking in. I had asked at reception after breakfast if it would be possible to check out slightly later than the stated midday & was told that it would not be a problem & it wasn't when we checked out around 12.30. No queues & nobody else waiting to check out. We paid our parking ticket in the vending machine situated at the lift to the car park. 
The positives for this hotel? The flexibility when we changed our booking twice, the staff, dinner & location, just 10 minutes walk from Liffey Valley shopping centre & Vue cinema complex.
The negatives? the queue when checking in, breakfast, outside noise, having to pay for the car park, the limited amount of room in the pool & the health & safety issues.
I doubt that I'll return",3,2011,12,04
249,Very welcoming service at very reasonable price.,"We spent an overnight here and found great convenience in the car park, very well organized and warm reception staff and high quality accommodation. Breakfast was also attractive and reasonably priced. The hotel was full of children indicating that young families also find good welcome here.",5,2011,11,28
249,"Nice, clean and will be back","My husband, three small children and I stayed here for weekend November 2011. We found the hotel very clean and inviting. Reception staff were lovely and helpful. We were given what I think was called a Junior suite. It consisted of a bathroom, bedroom with king size bed and sittingroom/kitchenette which had a folded out couch bed and an additional cot bed. The rooms were spottless, ideal that we had two tvs. The beds were confortable and the landing was very quite. There was an excellent selection of room service menus, although we didnt try it. The breakfast was extensive, buffet hot food, pastries, ice cold juices, teas, coffees, cold meats cheeses, fruit and youghurts. Staff were very pleasant. 
The location of the hotel is excellent. Liffey valley is 5 minute drive and Ikea 10mins and I had a course in Tallaght on the Saturday and this was only 15mins away. It is very easy to find and central to everywhere.",5,2011,11,28
249,I'm trying to sleep !.,"Well I'm writing this from my hotel room at 5.55a.m having just been woken by some idiot banging down my door, obviously at some party night, luckily they didn't wake my 3 year old.  It's not too bad though as I've been awake half the night anyway over the noise in the corridor and overhead, but I guess you can't really blame the hotel for noisy residents but it might be an idea to keep the people at the party nights on their own floor.  As for the hotel itself, not a 4 star at all but i should have expected that with the price........ We ate in Kudos bar, the staff could do with a personality transplant, a smile does go a long way, however no complaints on the food, very tasty and hot !!.  I went to reception with my daughter who is in a wheelchair and asked for a jug, I was told they wouldn't be kept here try one of the restaurants, yes got it there and thanks for offering help to bring it to my room as my hands were full....... Not.......The room is tired looking but that's a common complaint in these big hotel chains, the noise from flushing the toilet would wake the dead ! The whole floor vibrated too.  We got one towel to do three of us, are they kidding like. I'm a regular visitor to Dublin as my daughter attends a hospital here and usually stay in the Ibis but this time we thought we'd try something a bit better, well won't be doing that again, maybe I'm just grumpy from lack of sleep but I can honestly say I will never again stay here.",3,2011,11,25
249,Nice,It Was nice   pool   nice  staff  vvvgood. 1st time i went there ok but the last time it was lovely  i would now recomend it,4,2011,11,24
249,Great Value Hotel,"I stayed here for a weekend break with my sister and had a great time. Check in was seamless and efficient, our room was spotless and we availed of room service on the night of our arrival, which was both timely and very tasty. We had breakfast on both mornings - very tasty. This hotel is a long way from town so is not suitable for a night out in town but for a night away, shopping trip or a good base for an onward journey it is ideal. There is a lovely bar and restaurant on the same site which provides an alternative to the hotel menu. The location provides easy onward access to the airport/Dublin. Did not get a chance to avail of the leisure facilities on this visit, but will definitely be back.   
Orla, Galway",5,2011,11,23
249,Double bed is 2 single beds and noisy.,"Check in was pleasant and efficient, bedrooms are very nicely decorated, the location is great for M50/M4, free parking, Arc Bar is a 30 second walk away and The Leisure Centre is very good. 

However, the double bed is not a double bed, it's two single beds zipped together and is incredibly uncomfortable.  The fire doors slammed closed all night.  So between the awful bed and constant waking, it was an awful stay. 

When I checked out, i told the receptionist that I would like to make a complaint about the bed.  She told me that the majority of their accomidation had single beds joined into doubles.  I told her that this would put me off making another booking with the hotel.  She advised I could make a special request but they couldn't guarantee anything.  I stay 1-2 nights a week in Dublin, so it really surprises me that the hotel has no interest in securing my business by giving me a proper double bed.  Unless the hotel management address this ridiculous acquisition decision, I'd estimate they will turn a lot more potential customers away.  It's a shame, as the hotel is quite nice!

",2,2011,11,22
249,"Average hotel, long way out of Dublin!","The rooms are not bad looking, fairly modern.  The lighting was quite poor, only lamps with no overhead lighting so once it got dark outside the room was quite dim.  The bed pillows were odd, one large almost like a sofa cushion while the smaller pillow had no substance at all.  We were there during a warm spell and found the room got very hot even with the system off.  Our room was a ridiculously long walk from the front entrance - we could not find any other way to get in or out of the hotel so had to walk all the way around from the furthest end to leave or come back!  Our room was also right above the entry to the underground parking which did not help a good night's sleep!  We ate breakfast in the restaurant which was decent although getting a refill on coffee could be a problem (and it was not busy anytime we were in for breakfast so not sure what the waitresses were up to?!)  We tried out the hot tub one night, nice facilities but when you sign in upstairs they really should give you a towel then as you can't get them downstairs so we had to go back up.  Parking was not bad, nice to have underground.  There is a shopping center pretty close. Overall not too bad, but if you plan to spend your time in Dublin it's a long drive into the city.",3,2011,11,20
249,Such good value!!!,"€60 for a nights stay and it's worth more. Room is lovely, decorated really nice,hotel spotless. They even upgraded us complimentary to an apartment because they had no smoking room left. The apartment room is massive - big bedroom, lovely bathroom, small hall, kitchen come sitting room, massive tv and balcony. Great and convenient place to stay.",5,2011,11,20
249,Lacking on pretty much all the final touches,"Initially I was happy with room but very soon started noticing annoying things like the fact that there was no wifi in the bedroom even though they advertised having it. There was also no main light in the bedroom. The only light was the three lamps. There was no natural light as there were trees outside the window. One of the afternoons when I felt chilly and couldn't find the thermostat I came to learn that the heating in the hotel doesn't come on until 6pm. Lastly, the pillows on the bed were like sofa cushions... Huge and hard. As fancy and lovely as they looked they were totally impractical. Lastly, there were cobwebs in the corners of the ceiling.",2,2011,11,18
249,"Good business hotel, location isn't ideal","I stay in this hotel regularly for work because its the best of a few in the area. Its a long way out of the city in Dublin, so I don't usually go into Dublin when I stay for only a night or two. Restaurant and bar are decent but a bit over priced. Breakfast is quite good as far as most hotels go. Thai restaurant nearby is decent quality but also a bit over priced. Gym and pool are great, best feature of the hotel. 

I'm always by myself when I'm here for work, and as a woman I don't feel comfortable walking around this area by myself at night. Colleagues and cab drivers have warned me to be careful. It's near a big shopping centre, but it would be a 10/15min walk in a not-so-great neighbourhood.

Otherwise I've always found rooms clean and staff efficient and friendly. I think 59 Euro is a decent price for this hotel.",3,2011,11,15
249,Good for the price we paid.,"Stayed here over the October Bank Holiday,and for €59 a room thought it was good, sure its not the best or nicest hotel i've stayed in but for that price i thought it was good,Had dinner in the bar and that was fine,Overall the hotel is clean but showing some heavy wear in places,our room and bathroom was up to standard.",3,2011,11,07
249,Cleanliness - leaves a lot to be desired,"The hotel was very reasonably priced at €59 for the room for the night but even at that price I would expect a certain level of hygiene!
The carpets were disgustingly black with dirt.  And the breakfast room was the same.
The table were wiped with a dirty cloth and the cups and crockery and cutlery were very badly tea stained and water stained. 
The restaurant staff were very unhelpful with mono-sylabbic responses to everything and put their fingers in the ""clean"" cups to carry them.
The beds and bathroom were clean enough but I just felt on the whole that it could have been a lot cleaner.  The entire hotel could benefit from a paint job and bit of carpet shampoo!",2,2011,11,07
249,excellent for families,"We stayed with the 5 of us in the hotel apartment suites.  I booked over the phone and paid 99 euro per night (room only). The apartment was spacious and quite new and the kids loved it. An extra bed was added in the living-room.  Very quiet corner of the hotel but the main road next to the hotel is quite busy and somewhat noisy despite doubleglazed windows.  Kitchen well equipped (dishwasher, microwave, etc).  Kids loved the pool and the parents enjoyed the spa area.  Free wifi in the public areas of the hotel.  There is a big shopping area nearby which is handy for restaurants or to go to the movies with the kids.  Overall we were very pleased with our choice of hotel.",4,2011,11,04
249,Very Enjoyable and Relaxing Stay,"Myself, my husband and our two girls stayed 3 nights (room only). Booked online. We arrived at 1:20 on Sat. 29th and were promptly checked in. Our room was ready on the ground floor corridor.  My request to be moved to a higher level room with a double & two single beds as per booking receipt was promptly dealt with by a polite receptionist (Emma) & we were moved to a lovely room on the 3rd floor.  We ate in the bar.  Food good and staff friendly.  Prices average hotel bar prices. Some chips could be included with the lasagne and salad!  The Asian food is fresh and fab. Couches so relaxing with a glass of wine! Our 12 yr old shopped till she dropped and our 9 yr old loved the Hotel Halloween party on Mon. night. Also had fab dinner & breakfast in the ARC bar nearby Love to go back - might try Suites next time!",4,2011,11,02
249,Disappointed!,"Have stayed here twice before due to the face kids love the pool. But this will be my last time.
Booked it two weeks ago and specifically asked girl over phone, "" so it's 99 euro without breakfast for 2 nights"", Was told, ""yes 99 euro for 2 nights. I booked a one bedroom suite.
When i arrived with tired kids, big queue and apparently their systems crashed a week previous so had no record of booking. This wasnt a problem though as room was still available. Staff seemed disinterested and barely smiled.
Tols girl at checvk in i wanted to pay for the two nights in cash straight away and she said ok. She told me that it was 99 euro.
Long story short, when we checked out today, my husband was told, rudely, that we had to settle our bill! We assumed we had but no, they had made a mistake and said it was 99 euro for each night, even though at check in for my 2 night stay, i was charged 99 euro.
Manager was in background and could see and hear my anger but never apologised or asked what the problem was.
So overall, wont appear again. Staff also rude at breakfast, you would swear we were going to run out without paying. Very uncomfortable athmosphere. And 198 euro for 2 nights with no food was not a bargain in this day and age.
Also on first evening in pool, we arrived at half 5 in pool. Kids were jumping in to shalloow pool. Which was unnerving for the younger kids and babies in the pool, getting splashed. No parents seemed to stop them but more disturbingly, i could not see any lifeguard anywher. He arrived at 7 minutes to 6! Not good enough!
Beds very unconfortable and pillows werte like concrete blocks. Rooms were spotless though.

Cinema room had a large table down the middle of it and parents had to lift in their own chairs to make room. Lights were left on so was no enjoyable at all.
Couls be such a great family hotel with some improvements or maybe just some staff who gave a damn!!!",2,2011,10,31
249,Disappointing,"I stay in hotels with work regularly and have had to use this hotel on several occasions. The service from the conference steward (Thomasz?) is excellent, however the reception service is very poor. Frequently there is a queue to check in, and an apology is never offered. Any request seems like a real hassle, even a simple request to store luggage. 
Would suggest visitors use the Louis Fitzgerald instead. It's a similar price range but with free car parking and adjacent to the Luas stop.",2,2011,10,26
249,Exactly what we needed,"After being met with nothing short of a brick wall and rude operator when we tried to merge two bookings togehter we were looked after by front desk manager, Shannon, who was nothing short of the perfect example of customer care.  Our room was quite bg with three single beds and very comfortable.  Bathroom was spotless.  Room had TV, fridge, lots of storage, ironing board, hair dryner, etc.  Eventhough our room looked out onto the N4 we couldn't hear any traffic what so ever.  There was a vending machine at the lift on each floor which proved very handy when we got back late that night after the Arc bar next door.  Dinner was absolutely delicious and was included in the price.  Breakfast was served til 11 and check out wasn't til 12 which was an added bonus.  Staff at check in and check out were very friendly and helpful.  There is a swimming pool and jacuzzi but we didn't have time to use them.  I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2011,10,25
249,Who gave this hotel 4 stars????,"This is by fa the worst hotel I have stayed in; im not generally fussy but when you book 4 star you expect more than you get at the 2 or 3 star hotels you stayed in before and just less than any 5 star hotels! Whoever gave this its star rating really needs to go and look again!

So we arrived to find their systems were down; gave them our booking page which we had printed which stated 1 double and 1 single bed; there was only two of us staying but always enjoy having the slightly bigger room; not that big of a deal when they put us in a room with a double bed only; we were happy to deal with that; then the double bed turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together with a split in the middle; not that comfortable.

We had asked for a smoking room which we got but no ash tray; rang down to concierge said they would send one up; 1 hour later still no ashtray; walked to reception to be told they would send one up again; this took a further 15 mins. 

Had to report issues with the room ie: cracked mirrors to ensure they knew we werent at fault. We went shopping on the 2nd day arived back only to be locked out of our room as the key cards werent working; had to wait for those to be reprogammed no apologies just there ya go they are woking now. 

Went to the room it was freezing cold; rang down to get heat turned up to be told its automatic and it would be on later in the evening,,,um we were cold then!!!!

The room wasn't in great shape; no where near 4 star!!! AVOID",1,2011,10,23
249,Staff were good but very noisy hotel,"I booked a night stay for me and my fiancee for his birthday and when we got there we were just given a standard room which was fine but as we were getting ready to go to sleep we could hear EVERYTHING going on in all the rooms around us. We called reception and told them our complaint and asked to be moved. They then upgraded us to one of their swanky private rooms with a balcony, it's own living room and kitchen. It was absolutly gorgeous and really modern! However at around 3 am some guests on the floor above decided to throw a party and had us awake for several hours. We had to call reception 3 times to come up and ask them to be quiet. This of course wasn't the hotels or staffs fault so overall I would say it's a good hotel with great staff but they need to do something about the noise coming from other rooms.",3,2011,10,22
249,"If only staff made an effort , it's a decent hotel","Stayed there 2 years ago and again last week for one night. A bad omen, the car park ticket machine was not working, check in was very slow, but not as slow as bar food! Room on ground floor was a big mistake, constant traffic in the corridor during the night = little sleep. Breakfast average fare. Management need to improve staff performance. I won't be back. ",2,2011,10,21
249,breakfast very poor,"my husband myself and my two children stayed recently at the clarion hotel liffey valley and found the breakfast very poor, firstly the ware, the bowels etd. were dirty we had to go through a few to get a clean one, this did not just happen on one morning, this happened three mornings in a row! the breakfast itself was only ok we only went back because it was included in our package. The hotel overall was lovely but if i was going back I would not ne getting breakfast.",4,2011,10,08
249,Unexpectedly Annoying,"We are big fans of Clarion and other Choice Hotels.  However, we were not happy with the Clarion Liffey Valley.  We stayed three nights.  The room and facility was tidy and well appointed, but that is about the only nice thing we can say.

Upon checking in, we were given what can only be described as a basement room.  The lighting in the room was terrible and the room was cold.  We tried to turn the heat on, but it did not work.  

We contacted the front desk, assuming we were doing something wrong with the heat.  They offered to move us to another room the following night.

The second room was only a little better lit and it seemed the heat still did not work.  On of the front desk staff members mentioned that the heat may not have been turned on hotel-wide yet.

To make matters worse, the second room we were provided was down to very long corridors.  The only guest entrance and exit to the hotel was through the lobby.  So, although we were parked in an underground garage pretty much under our room, we had to lug all of our luggage all the way to the lobby, then back to where our car was.

At night, the events hosted in the hotel ballroom would spill into the parking lot and a lot of noise traveled through the windows.  We were awoken several times from the noise.

We definitely would not stay at this hotel again.",2,2011,10,02
249,"Terrible bed, and a good bit of noise","Stayed here last night after long long day. Looking forward to falling into bed and sleeping. Was woken on around 3 occasions because the bed was so uncomfortable. Springs crap etc. 3 year old daughter staying with me, and she found it hard to sleep with all the noise, esp every time I flushed the toilet, the pipes made a terrible racket. 
And as also mentioned, why on earth was I charged 4 quid for car park that is in the hotel??
Only thing going for it was that it was right beside the Hermitage where I needed to get to for 9am this morning.",2,2011,09,28
249,Watch out for billing errors,"Attempted to book a Room and Breakfast Combo Deal for a Non Smoking Room @ €69 on line to be told no non smoking rooms available. I was able to book a Non Smoking room (1 out of 41 available) for €59. After waiting in line for 12 minutes to check in, I asked the Gentleman to add breakfast to my room rate which he undertook to do for €10. This would have afforded me the same as the previous combo deal. On entering my room I found the bedroom to be adequate and fresh but the bathroom not great, cleaners need to clean tramlines in bath and clean to edges on floor. Next morning at Breakfast I was asked to pay for my breakfast as it was not part of my deal, the Waitress eventually rang reception and got it added to my tab. On checking out I was asked to pay €83 which was broken down as Room €59 Breakfast by 2 €20 and €4 Car Parking. I eventually got the second breakfast discounted. I accepted the parking charge as this is clearly posted as you enter carpark but would expect that the Hotel could offer free parking to residents as opposed to day trippers or meeting room business. This hotel is well located but their staff and systems sell them short. Normally stay in Bewleys at Newlands Cross and will be going back there.",2,2011,09,28
249,Poor,"Hotel itself is alright. Rooms are poor, dirty bed clothes. Also the parking situation needs to be sorted out, why is there a need to pay when you are staying @ hotel? Reception staff not very clear on this when I ask.

Beds are terrible also. slanting into the middle.

Wouldn't recommend to others. Go somewhere else",2,2011,09,26
249,"Clarion Suites, Liffey Valley","We stayed here in Sept 2011. We were thrilled with the space. We booked a 2 bed suite. We had 2 large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a huge living/dining room and combined with a balcony and decent sized hallways, we had loads of space.
The place was clean although smoky when we arrived, we opened the windows as we were going out again so that helped.
The kitched was fine although no cooker - just a microwave and toaster.
Overall, we were delgihted with the place - the Arc next door has a good menu and good value. You do need a car to explore Dublin but it's location is perfect for hopping on the motorway to whereever you need to go. Also, Liffey Valley shopping centre is within walking distance.
Any staff we encountered were helpful and pleasent. We didn't get to use the pool or gym unfort.",4,2011,09,21
249,A let Down,"The hotel its self is modern with good furnishing, 
But the room are stiffling hot , the heat can not be adjusted . We stayed on a meal plan basis. The food was poor and pretty bland . I even sent my desert back and told the waitress we would not pay for it. ALSO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING  ????. You can park at liffey valley or the ARK next door for free.

The staff are a credit but seemed to be overwhelmed at times. We called reception at  8.30 am and ask for some loo roll to be sent to the room . We left for Breakfast @ 9.45 and still have non even though I had asked 3 times. It was eventually delivered while we were out to breakfast. 
We have ate in the ARK next door previously and would recomed using that facility or even McDonalds . In sumation its a lovley hotel but the standards are poor and I feel managment need to adress these issues",2,2011,09,19
249,Unexpected Supprise,"We booked the room on a Friday night, for Friday night directly with the Hotel for €59.  We were meet at the check in desk 40 minutes later, we explained that we were married 14 years and decided to stay up in Dublin for the night, so we asked for a quite room.  We had stayed at the hotel before so we know what to expect.  However, we were then upgraded to a suite, which made our night.  The suite was excellent and contained a mini kitchen with fridge and microwave.  The room was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay.  We will be back again.",4,2011,09,13
249,Nice enough hotel,"Location is quite a bit out of dublin city, but is close to liffy shopping centre and cinema. Check in was swift and easy, and staff efficient. 

Rooms were tidy and clean, as was the bathroom. No wifi in rooms was dissapointing and this was only available in the lobby and bar. Rooms are quite dimly lit however bright light is in the bathroom anyway. 

I would say the walls or doors need better insulated against noise as we were woke out of our sleep with passing people in the early hours in the corridors and adjoining rooms. Other than that we were happy with our room. Tv, big proper hairdryer (not travel size as normal), iron, ironing board, safe and mini fridge (altho no contents) are in the rooms. 

Breakfast in the morning was very good i have to say and not overly busy!

Unfortunately i didn't get to see the spa/swimming pool facilities. But the bar was very busy and lively! Restaurant has a good deal where you get a meal and entry to the cinema for 20 euro or there abouts. We didnt avail of this so cannot comment on the meals! Car Parking is charged at 4 euro, altho i feel this should be offered for free as you are far out of town!

We had other people travelling with us, unfortunately their trip was not as pleasant as ours. They checked in late on sat nite/ sun morning and paid by cash. On check out the staff said they still had to pay their balance!!! Not good enough!!!",3,2011,09,12
249,Disappointed,"Initial surprise at being charged to use the hotel car park, despite it being well out of the city and the local parking areas having restrictions to prevent hotel customers using the roads and other parking. The receptionist did suggest the Liffey Shopping Centre as a free alternative, which was at least a 10 minute walk away.
The bedroom was standard, but we had to request towels and additional pillows, which were delivered quickly. However there was very little toilet paper available and this was not replenished as requested at reception.
The breakfast buffet was good and they do give advance warning of delays at peak times.",3,2011,09,05
249,Great value offer,"However the service is not great. Very slow to check in and check out.
The rooms were lovely and very clean
Got a late check out which was great.
dont think I would go back.",2,2011,09,05
249,Great if travelling with kids,"We stayed here for one night at the end of August. We had our two kids with us our 4 year old and an 18 month old. We only rang to make the booking on the morning of the trip and the staff were excellent. We explained that we wanted a bit of space and they suggested a suite. We paid €124 for all of us, 2 adults and 2 children including bed and breakfast. The suite had two rooms, so we could use the sitting room with the pull out sofa for the 4 year old and the travel cot fit in that room also. Then we had our own room. The kids had plenty of room to run in and out from room to room to keep themselves entertained. We ate in the bar in the evening as the kids were hungry, the kids food was good and they enjoyed it, we ate from the Asian menu and it was ok, but again with kids we knew we were not going to have a a great big sit down meal. The beds were comfy and rooms were grand, they were quite warm but we managed ok.
The little kitchen was handy for warming the bottle etc. The breakfast the next morning was great, the service was good and the kids were delighted with the choice.
Overall I would stay in this hotel again and I would recommend it if you are travelling with children.",4,2011,09,05
249,Great for Family stay...,"Had stayed here a few years back but had forgotten how good a hotel it is , stayed again recently for a short stay and was v impressed with the hotel , we stayed in a family suite which was great , 2 big rooms with TVs and tea making facilities , the bathroom too was just right  , the overall decor of the hotel we found just right neither too fancy and stuffy or dark and dingy. .
The breakfast was also great all you could want and more .The area was great and perfect for shopping in Liffey Valley which was within walking distance. We drove up from the south and the hotel was very easy to get to. It is also just a short distance from the zoo
So overall very impressed , with the location , value and service and we will definately be back",4,2011,08,27
249,Disappointed to say the least,"Myself my partner and our 9 month old baby stayed here for two nights. We booked an executive suite. We were very disappointed. No sir conditioning at all in the rooms, just two fans, and two windows that bearly opened. The bathroom was very small. Beds were not comfortable. All the corridors were lined with laundry bags, dishes and glasses from other rooms. Very busy hotel. We brought our baby to the pool for the first time, and I was not allowed to take a picture even though no other people would be in the photo. we had to pay an extra 4 euro a day fir the car park. Even though the location is excellent i Don't think we will be back. ",3,2011,08,26
249,Good Value,Busy hotel outside #dublin city center( about 40 min ride on bus no 78a).Stayed there for 2nights with 2 kids.Swimming pool ok-no toys or arm bands for children!!Good food in Kudos bar priced around 13 euro a dish.5 min walk from Liffey Valley Shopping Center.Nice staff .Rooms very clean but during the night time bit too warm.,4,2011,08,25
249,Good value no frills hotel,"The main attraction   for this hotel  is the rooms are sold at  good value rates 
The rooms themselves are  adequate - our family room , though not overly spacious was a single a double and cot bed - sleeping 2 xa+2xc adequately
Pool is bonus for kids  but tends to be very busy - just like hotel 
Bar food is satisfactory and not overly priced 
Car parking charge is reasonable by dublin standards 
Ideally you ll need a car to access dublin but liffey valley shopping is nearby 
For the  rates charged the hotel offers good value  but with no four  star frills - probably a 3+ star",3,2011,08,23
249,Not four star and rooms like a sauna!!!,"Hotel is not a four star. Three star tops. Very large hotel, really only for a one night place to lay your head. The restaurant is very expensive. The games room had no windows and no a/c, too stuffy to spend any time in there. And the pool table and arcade game were both out of order. Breakfast was ok, plenty of choice. Our extra bed was broken when we arrived and they replaced it quite quickly. Worst part was the heat, the rooms were rediculously hot even with the fan on and window open. Would not go back.",3,2011,08,22
249,NICE SPOT,"Had a one night stay at this hotel on Saturday night - 2ad 2ch.  Stayed on the third floor - which was way too hot!!!!, even with the window opened and a fan!  The swimming pool was very crowded on both the Saturday night and Sunday morning, but the kids had a great time.....got this hotel for less than 50quid through Travel Republic - can't complain about it at this price......we will be back next time we are in the area.........",4,2011,08,19
249,Very disappointing,"The Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley is not a 4 star hotel.  Do not be fooled by their advertising. There are better 3 star hotels around.
- Clarion claim your room will be ready from 2 pm - we had to wait almost an hour
- The corridor had litter in the doorways that was still there the following morning.
- It was impossible to control the temperature of the shower.
- The room was very small for a 4 star family room.
- The breakfast buffet was poor quality.
- The swimming pool is either ankle deep for toddlers or 1.4m deep - nothing in between.  And there are cracks in the tiles and the walls.

Worst of all - the air conditioning in the bedroom was not working.  It was a sweat box even with the window open and the fan working all night. 

My complaint was listened to but paid lip service by the duty manager - their lower prices reflected this fault!  What?  It was not mentioned during booking or check in and the prices for this Clarion hotel were no different to their other hotels.

We had booked a 2 night stay and the kids were glad to leave the hotel after one night which says everything.

Very disappointed",2,2011,08,19
249,a great hotel to bring children too.,"Just back from a 3 night stay, and have to say it was very enjoyable...Very clean and tidy..Food was gorgeous and the staff were very nice and helpful.....  Just want to mention Shannon  who was the receptionist who booked us in and out... She was extremely pleasant and very chatty, checking us in and out without a hitch.... Would def go back to this hotel with my 2 boys, so handy for the shopping centre and the cinema.",5,2011,08,18
249,"good value, friendly staff, will return","Stayed in Clarion for weekend break with my partner.  I would recommend this hotel, the rooms are clean and spacious, staff very frendly and helpful.  We requested hair dryer & iron these were brought up to our room straight away.  Food was excellent. Hotel located beside Shopping ctr and cinema with nite club close by. Well worth a visit!!",4,2011,08,17
249,Will definitely go back,"Just back from a 2 night break and I have to say we would go back tomorrow.  The staff were great and did everything to make our stay enjoyable.  I travelled with husband, daughter and a baby.  Had a family room first nite, then decided to check if a suite was available and they transferred us no bother.  We would have been very happy to stay in the room but my sister had stayed the two nights previously with her family in a suite (upgraded free of charge also) and my daughter asked if we could stay in a room the same as her cousins.  The location was ideal for us - 10 minutes to the Zoo, 10 minutes to the Aquatic Centre and on the right side of Dublin for the National Stud.  Yes, the M50 does go past but I didnt hear it much and we faced it on the 2nd night.  We have stayed in a lot of hotels and this ranks up there for value and service.  Do not listen to all the reviews as they can be misleading, do as I did and find out for yourself.  Only downside - the heat in the room but this is managable.",4,2011,08,17
249,VERY PLEASED WOULD DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN!,"Stayed here for one night and was really happy with it ! You get what you pay for ! At €59 a room how can you complain! The rooms was big and clean and the bathroom was perfect couldn't find fault with it to be fair. The leisure centre is really good, decent sized pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna everything u cud want in a leisure centre! Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and polite. Taxi's to and from the city centre worked out at €19/€20 each way. Underground carpark extremely safe for cars overnight and parking was only €4. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,08,15
249,Pleasant and good base for a short stay in Dublin.,"We stayed at the Clarion for three nights and found it to be better than the reviews we had previously read. Check in was smooth and staff helpful. Room was comfortable although very hot at night but there was a fan in the room which we used. There was a fridge in the room which was helpful for storing drinks for the children. The pool was good although children are only allowed in after nine in the morning which didn't suit us as  we prefer a swim before breakfast. The quality of food was  very good however the table d'h menu was very repetitive. You have to pay four Euros per day for parking which seems ridiculous. The hotel is situated close to Dublin although according to anyone you ask it should take you 20 mins to get anywhere, it does in fact often take much less!The staff in particular Ciara and Shona were very helpful and pleasant. We would go back and recommend it.",4,2011,08,14
249,You get what you pay for,"Stayed overnight, double bed and two singles in the room for €59. Our room was on the side of the N4 which made it very noisy so would request room on other side if staying here. Room was very hot with no air con, just a fan which was ok. Rooms are basic, but it was clean. The hotel itself was very busy and noisy so not for a romantic getaway! Used the pool which was fairly chilly, underground parking for a small charge. It's cheap but not exactly cheerful.",3,2011,08,14
249,you can do more,"beautifull luxury room. good breakfast but the diner was terrific! the meat was like cartoon without sauce, vegetables without taste also the apple pie.
the security carpet in the bathroom was dangerous! I will fall with it!
the fridge didn't work and I had through away my sandwitches. a very long way to my room! i must do sport with my luggage to arrive in front of the motorway from my room.",3,2011,08,14
249,Family holiday,"Just returned from a two night stay at the clarion. Very nice hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful with directions to places we wanted to visit. 
There's a pub a across the road (can't remember the name). We ate there on both evening's. I have never met such courteous staff, they were great, the food was enjoyable.
The only downside about the hotel, was the rooms were like a sauna. No need for pyjamas. Make sure your room has a fan in it.",4,2011,08,13
249,Reasonable hotel,"We stayed here on Thursday 11th August. I booked a room with a double and a single bed as we are two adults and one teenager. Arrived at the hotel, checked in and when we got to our room there was only one double bed. Contacted reception who asked us to come back down again and after a phone call to housekeeping was told we could go back to our room and a single bed would be sent up. A fold up bed arrived after 20 mins. My only complaint was that we had been booked into a disabled room as there was no bath just a shower with a small glass ""fence"" around it and there was a constant beep coming from the disabled assistance for the toilet. Quite a big hotel so long walk to get to the leisure centre. When we arrived down to breakfast the next morning there was nothing but tomatoes left in the buffet as it had all been eaten so had to wait a couple of minutes for more to be cooked. Interleading room door was unlocked but housekeeping looked as soon as I asked. Overall pleasant stay.",3,2011,08,12
249,Great!!!!,On a short trip with 2 young boys. Was everything it said on the tin. Clean spacious family room. Decent food at dinner. Good breakfast. Pool busy but excellent staff at pool. Keep up the good work!,4,2011,08,12
249,Not much craic -,"Suitable for business trip. Families? Rooms are clean, beds comfortable. Leisure facilities are excellent. We paid £150 for 2 adult 1 child B,B and evening meal. Fair price but disappointed that the menu was the same for all 5 nights! We opted out of this deal. Nothing Irish about this hotel which is a shame and the staff look like they're bored out of their brains. I nearly fell asleep at the dinner table no craic and the background music was dreadful. more craic at a wake!!!!! Service is slowwwww too!",2,2011,08,10
249,Not even worth the 59 euro for the room,"Please think again before booking this hotel we stayed there last Sunday night in this hotel and will never stay again in this Hotel, The rooms are old and dated and need to be painted the carpets need to be cleaned. Beside this was the fire alarm going off at 12 O'clock at night and not stopping till one in the morning and  having to wake and take our two children down stairs at that time and told nothing till that following morning( when i had to ask what happened i was told someone in the apartments said there was a fire) But there was no fire thank God but six fire engines came and with the noise of them and the people in the corridors it was a very late night.

So i am really sorry but its not worth the money",2,2011,08,10
249,Very disappointed,"We stayed in an apartment at The Clarion as we have a 2 year old and we thought we'd all sleep better if he was in a separate room.  However that was the only advantage.  Our first impression was of the smell but unfortunately we didn't think to specify a non-smoking room, so this may have explained it. The door between us and the next apartment was unlocked. We expected cooking facilities yet had to request a microwave which is the extent of the cooking facilities.  We had to request an iron and ironing board also.  The air-conditioning was not working and a large fan was provided which was much too loud to use at night.  We used the pool and, yes, you have to wear a swimming hat (€3) and pay a deposit for a lock for the lockers, they provide towels though.  My son slipped twice and banged his head as the tiles are completely unsuitable for a pool area.  Other children slipped on the same occasion. On returning to our room the lights in the bedroom weren't working and even after one of the staff had reset the fuse one of the lamps was constantly going on and off. At night we were kept awake by the music and shouting from a night club across the road which ended at about 3. We were on the left of the complex on entering. Needless to say, we won't be returning!",2,2011,08,10
249,lovely stay,"nice hotel,had good resturant,lovely food,nice staff apart from one person on arrival that wasnt very nice but overall the rest of the staff were extra friendly which is so important to me. great value for money free breakfast in the offer i got on a saturday night. would go back again its so close to liffey value shoppin centre its perfect for a shoppin trip.",4,2011,08,08
249,"A bit of a shambles, not great for families and LOADS of potential hidden extras","This hotel was recommended by two friends independently as good family accommodation. On the website it advertises itself as such. We booked a 1-bed apartment with sofa-bed in living room and kitchen. We checked in, went to our apartment and discovered no sofa-bed (I was with my husband and 3 boys aged 7,4 and 6months) so we asked to be moved. We were moved to the next apartment then had to re-request a travel cot. There was no remote for the TV so had to ring reception yet again. When we discovered towels for only two people and no cooking facilities in the kitchen - not even a microwave - we just gave up. 

I then took my sons to Kids Club advertised as part of hotel. It isn't. I was told by a very charming young man that 'hotel guests seem to think this comes as part of their stay' - not his fault, but I told him the hotel website needs to change its info. My husband took boys for a swim while I went in search of a non-cook supper to have in room (hotel restaurant and room service charges were extortionate) and the pool staff lost his room key. The pool is free but you have to pay £3 per person for their swimming hat.

We won't go back.",2,2011,08,08
249,Walkin cheaper than online!,"Booked a room online (choicehotels.com) on 25/07/2011 for night of 27/07/2011 - ""Best Rate Available"" €69.00.  Arrived at hotel to find HUGE sign on end of building ""ALL ROOMS €59"".  Reception also had a Flashing screen with same message.

249,"Clean, Spacious, Family Friendly,  We'll be back !","Hi there, stayed here August of 2011.  2 adults and 3 kids.  This is one of the VERY few hotels in Dublin which has family rooms for more than 2 adults and 2 kids.  We rented a 1 bedroom apartment for 99euro a night, it was huge! In the apartment we had a regular sized bathroom, cupboard room which housed a washer/dryer, bedroom with super kingsize bed with tv, dvd player and walkin wardrobe (with a small safe), ironing board and iron.  Living dining room / kitchen had comfy sofabed and we had an extra sofabed, loads of room.  Kitchen had microwave, fridge with small freezer compartment, dishwasher and usual cutlery.  If you think you will need to use any of these appliances bring washing powder / dishwasher tablets.  A dishcloth and washing up liquid would probably be handy too.  

Hotel is in a great location, as its close to the major motorway of course it can be noisy.  Theres a restaurant and bar 100 yards away although we didnt hear any noise at all from this.  Theres also a huge mall within short walking distance too which has a few great places to eat.

Kids loved the pool and loved the lobby/ reception area in the evenings.  Staff were incredibly helpful.  This is a very popular hotel due to its location and is a great base for seeing the sights.  Its located on the outskirts of Dublin.  We used a car to visit the sights.

I've stayed in a number of hotels in Dublin.  Many were twice / three times the price we paid per night for our family and were of the same standard.  If you're happy to drive to the sights or use the bus to get into Dublin this is the hotel for you.  Personally we'll be back.! :)",5,2011,08,05
249,Will not go back,"Myself my husband and son(just under two years of age) along with my isster and her husband stayed in the Clarion Suites part of  this hotel. It was a ttwo bedrroomed appartmment. The living area was huge as other reviews have said..However there was  no air con, instead there were fans in each room,, which  athough fine in the day are way too noisey at night. The bedrooms both had double beds pushed  togeether, the internet access never workked(during the  four nights we stayed) Also there is very limied parking for the suites(as in about ten spaaces)if u don't get a space then you have to park in the main car park,  which believe me happens,  which is charged at a daily rate of €4, which I feell is ridiculous. The swimming pool was pretty good and I'm told the gym was quit big(If you want to use the locker to keep valuables in you need €2,juust so you know cuz Ii never briing money to the pool with me,swim hats ther at  €4 euro each To be perfecctlyy honest none of these things would have bothered me so much if it wassn't  for the nightclub and patrons making an unbelievable amount of noise, the choice was be  roasting hot with minimal noise(which was still pretty loud), or hear the roaring of people having a good time along with a really heavy bass sound coming through the window(this I am not exagerating) I could also hear the lyrics of the songs being played, in my estimation  way too loud. This musiv woke my son at around 1.30am along with the drunken noises he didnt go backto  sleep untill about 6.00am.So as many of you know disrupts the whole day. Also whats kind of annoying is that there's a dishwwasherr but there is no supply of dishwasher tablets or even a bit of washing up liquid and a sponge supplied, also  no tea towel which means you have to go out and buy them. Also fr a self cteriing suitethere's only a microwave grill,which is a bit inconvienent and it was filthy. We spoke to staff  about the air con,but was told that it hadn't worked in a long time. We also informed them about the internet but they were unable to fix it.. Supposedly our suite was facing the wrong side for  noise but all the suites were booked, upon checking out there was only weekend staff as it was the bank holiday, so I will be writting to the manager of this hotel and complaining.
I would only recommend this hotel if you want to party, not sleep during the night ,love not havinng air,have no children and dont want to use plates or cuttlery.
The two stars are for the size of the suite, this is not  a four star hotel, it may have the facade of  a four staff, but scrap the surface and  you are left with two.",2,2011,08,04
249,Will probably stay again,"We stayed in one of the apartments located on the site of this hotel. The area was great and perfect for shopping in Liffey Valley which was easy walking distance.  We drove up from the west and the hotel was very easy to get to. It is also just a short distance from the zoo.
The apartment itself was a bit of a let down.  On the picture of the apartment it showed a microwave but there was none so was a waste of time bringing microwave popcorn with us to have while watching a movie with the kids.  We ended up watching the movie on the laptop because you had to rent a dvd player.  There was a miss match of plates, cups, glasses etc.  No tea bags or coffee, although there was a fridge, kettle and toaster.  I wasn't asked on check out if everything was ok because if I was i would have addressed these issues.  
The leisure centre was nice and the kids enjoyed there swim. 
I would stay here again because of the location but wouldn't pay extra for an apartment when it probably had less to offer then a family room.",3,2011,07,29
249,"Not a bad hotel, but food lets it down.","Stayed in the Clarion for one night, after my sons graduation on 23rd of june. The room itself was of a good standard, with good quality bed linen. I found the bathroom to be well worn and in need of freshening up. The carpets in the corridor area outside our room smelt stale and the odour was quite heavy. The following morning after a pleasent nights sleep we were looking forward to breakfast...we were so disappointed, the breakfast, although hot was for some strange reason hard..the bacon you could break in half and the black and white pudding was so hard, you could not cut through it. We have stayed in this hotel before, but the food quality has taken a nose dive. Over all a decent hotel, but food could be improved.",3,2011,07,29
249,"Noisey hotel, too many coach tours!!!","On arrival the lobby area looks good. Check in was slow - only one person on 3 desks.
I was given a suite because there were no rooms left, which was a small mercy as the hotel was packed with coach parties.
I counted 7 coaches parked in the car park - American, Japanese, German - which made for an overcrowded breakfast dining room.  Non-coach party guests were corralled into the smaller section of the dining room & I ended up sharing my table with several others who just couldn't find anywhere to sit.  The breakfasy was OK, but the staff were more concentrated on the coach parties that on their other guests.
I found the bar area depressing, with low lighting & a low ceiling.
I would think twice before staying here again!!!",3,2011,07,29
249,Does what it says on the tin!,"Stayed in an executive suite room here with my husband and 3 kids (4,6,8) - kids slept on a sofa bed and camp bed in a separate room from our bedroom - so that was great.  Extra beds meant that the kitchenette wasn't very accessible but it was still an asset - fridge, microwave , kettle and toaster.  Kids room smelt of smoke initially which was NOT good, but smell cleared quickly.  Rooms comfy - paint a bit chipped but all very clean.  Biggest hit was the 'floats' session in the pool from 2-5pm where the kids had a ball... Huge big rubber rings and yet still plenty of space in the pool to swim a few lengths.  Breakfast was reasonable enough considering the large numbers passing through. Service was very fast.  Another very good aspect of this hotel is easy access - it's just off the M50 and the main road to the west of Ireland.  It would be very difficult not to find it!  Coming from Sligo for an overnight , it was ideal.  Staff at reception were extremely helpful.",4,2011,07,26
249,Great location,"I stayed here with my family for 2 nights. We were upgraded to a suite, lucky! The suite was lovely. Spacious, clean , comfy beds. Also nice kitchenette! Only downside was no air con made it very hot at night!! I mean hot!! But otherwise, everything was wonderful! The breakfast was lovely. Pool great. Receptionists were helpful. And service was fast, efficient.",3,2011,07,24
249,"Surprisingly, a very good stay","We werent expecting much as the 1 night deal we got for couples was €109 including dinner. We live locally and have been in the hotel often but have never stayed. Die to excpetional circumstances we needed to stay out of our home but locally for one night so we availed of this deal.

We arrived late (9.30pm) and the receptionist, very friendly checked us in very quickly and advised us to go to the restaurant to avail of the meal deal that came with our accomodation. We had asked for a quiet room and were absolutely delighted when we got to our room. It was a suite with a deck balcony, overlooking the main road and the liffey valley. The room itself was well equipped with a kitchenette and sofa,table and flat screen tv. It would have been nice if there had been furniture on the deck but I suppose with the weather in Ireland it would be used very infrequently!.

We went to the dining room for dinner and waited at the entrance to be seated, the service inthe dining room was sporadic and we were ignored by a member of staff as she carried on doing something at the till while we stood at the entrance waiting to be seated. Eventually a manageress came over and seated us. We were given a ""special"" menu and ordered, it was only when we had ordered that we realised that the traditional side orders that normal accompany a meal were not included so I ate my salmon with the savoy cabbage and lived with out any other side of potato/veg. The food was nice, the service as I said was sporadic and poor in places. We were served by 3 or 4 different members of staff and the nicest girl was an indian girl who was very polite and helpful, she compensated for some of the other staff members.

In the morning we availed of the gym and pool facilites which were adeqate although you are unable to drink water in the gym as they don't provide any cups, you have to buy a bottle from reception.. a little impractical for hotel guests!
The pool is well maintained and very child friendly.

The breakfast was excellent... can't beat a full irish to keep you going for the day and this was among one of the better breakfasts I have had in an irish hotel. We checked out at 11 and headed to Liffey valley for some shopping, it is so close. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone but especially families as it is geared up to cater for kids. Our stay was made extra special by the fabulous room/suite we had so can't comment on ""normal"" rooms but at €59 per room per night, it is pretty good value by any stretch.",5,2011,07,23
249,2 Bed Apartment,"Stayed in the 2 bedroom apartments in the separate building to the hotel. The apartment is massive. It has a huge living dining area, 2 bathrooms, kitchen with microwave, washer/dryer. 

You have full use of the swimming pool in the main hotel. 

We'd definitely stay again. ",4,2011,07,20
249,Perfect Location,"Perfect location, great breakfast and easy access to Liffey Valley shopping  centre, also shuttle bus to airport....would def stay there again",4,2011,07,18
249,Great value hotel,"Stayed in the Clarion Liffey Valley in September last year with a group of friends. The hotel was lovely, we especially liked the adjoining rooms. Food was good, service too. Weren't mad a bout the bar but there is a livelier spot 2 miutes walk from the hotel that was great. We got a great deal for dinner B&B, would definitely return.",4,2011,07,18
249,Very good for the deal we got,"My girlfriend and I are just back from a 2 night stay here with a discounted deal we got through an insurance company we use.  We were able to get 2 nights for both of us at room only for 100 euros.  We thought this was great value for a 4 star hotel and overall enjoyed our stay and it is a nice hotel and we had full use of the facilities, pool, jacuzzi and steam room which were very clean and well looked after.
There are a couple of things that I would like to point out.  On arrival the service was informative but not overly friendly and when we got to the room there was a used tray with plates and glasses right outside our door which wasn't very nice and this was late afternoon and should have been collected.
Once in the room it was spacious and clean but only had a CRT TV, not a flat screen.  A bit average for a 4 star hotel.  
And one thing that really annoyed me was the bed was in fact two single beds joined together to make a double bed when we requested a double room.  This meant there was an annoying ridge in the middle making it difficult to lie together.
Also the room was extremely warm but we did have a fan supplied.  And the only the middle window opened about 4 inches if that.
Overall we had a pleasant stay but I would not pay any more than what we did to stay there as I would not rate it as a 4 star hotel.  
We would go back but only on the same deal",3,2011,07,17
249,Will be back again,"I travelled with my husband & two small children.  This hotel is very child friendly, clean, breaky & bar food lovely.  For the price we paid B&B family room was very good.  We really enjoyed our stay.  The only fault i have - they charge way to much for an Irish Coffee €6.95 rip off, so dont have an Irish coffee, also they charge 90cent for a glass of water with orange mix for kids, another rip off, so bring your own drinks for the kids.",5,2011,07,13
249,value for money,"Have stayed here before, always found it good value for the money, good comfortable rooms, nice eating areas, only niggle I have is that they now charge you 4 euro to park your car overnight on there own property, but even so I would stay here again.",4,2011,07,08
249,Won't be back,"We've booked a room with this hotel just for a nice weekend away in Dublin. On check-in we didn't get any info about dinner (which was included), breakfast or where our room is. We've requested a nice room and actually wouldn't mind the fact that room was a long way from reception, in old part of the building, but room itself looked like it wasn't refrubrished for years. Whilst taking a shower the loud noise was coming out from the wall. In Sinergie restaurant no atmosphere during dinner, no music, however a female (I think from India) staff member was very friendly. On check-out no question from staff about our stay. We got impression they are bit overworked at reception.",2,2011,07,05
249,Awful Rowdy  Hotel With Rude Untrained Staff,"Service at  Reception was very poor , they  even failed to activate the room keys.  
 When we asked at 4pm what  time dinner would be served they didn't know.    We were with a Shearings coach trip  and were kept hanging about until 8pm when they told us dinner would be at 8.30. Service was very bad, our orders were taken and 20mins later the waitress came back again with menus.  Completely forgetting she had already taken orders for the 8 people on our table.We were not served till gone 9o'clock .
 The food was cooked for shearings guests  and there was a choice of 2 starters dinner and sweet, allthe food was atrocious. The waitresses  were rude and untrained. 
The  Hotel was very very rowdy ,and  so noisy it was hard to hold a conversation with other guests, and it certainly spoilt the start of our holiday in Ireland.
The  rooms were  a good size and very clean and breakfast next morning in Pegasus was much improved on the previous evenings meal,  with a vast selection of choice and very good service. The waiters were so much better at their job and not at all rude like the WAITRESSES in the restaurant the previous evening. 
                            THIS IS CERTAINLY A HOTEL TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1,2011,06,29
249,Could be a great hotel (its far from it though),"I have now stayed at this Clarion 4 or 5 times. Mainly as its convenient but to be honest I am probably not going to stay here again.

Check-in. Most of the staff are very friendly. However there are never enough of them and there are always massive queues at reception. Even at 9pm at night you have to queue to speak to someone. At checkout today between 8 and 9.30am there was one staff member on reception and the hotel was full.

Rooms. I have no problems with the rooms (apart from lack of air con) as they do the job and whilst not luxurious are certainly above average. They could do with replacing the enormous TVs and getting some more up to date LCD tvs and the internet was a bit hit and miss. Soundproofing would also be good as being woken at 6.30am by other guests is not ideal.

Leisure club. Nice swimming pool (much better than the Clarion Dublin City). The only problem with using the leisure facilities is the ridiculous procedure to actually get in there.  Firstly if you want a padlock for the lockers you need to leave a cash deposit at the leisure club reception and secondly they make you leave your room key. To be honest it makes no sense why you need to leave your room key. What do they think I am going to do? It also opens up security questions as they have my room number and key and know that I am in the pool. 

Breakfast. Totally shambolic on EVERY occasion. If its quiet or busy they still seem to have no idea how to run a restaurant. On each visit (regardless of time) you are greeted with a sea of tables that have not been cleared. If you are lucky you might find a clear one. Then you have to find someone who will bring you coffee or tea. Its all a bit hit or miss. The issue here is that nobody seems to be in charge so there is no structure and staff seem to just wander around doing bits of whatever they want. There are enough staff (7 today) but if they had defined roles and someone to motivate them it would probably smooth the whole breakfast process out for guests (and staff).

Dinner. Not great quality food. Have had room service on a couple of occasions and the guy who delivered was rude both times. The first time the food took almost 90 minutes to arrive without apology.

If you want a cheap hotel outside of Dublin then you will be happy here but do not expect anything more than average.",3,2011,06,29
249,Average,"Good value break, hotel is average, staff are efficent but not very friendly. Food in the bar and breakfast were good. Great location if you going to dublin for a shopping trip as it's right next door to the liffey valley. Rooms were big and clean.  Also has a lesiure centre. Charge for parking this time. We have stayed at this hotel a few times and there was never a charge for parking. As it is so far outside the city it is difficult to justify this charge also it's frustrating if you want to come and go during the day you need to queue at reception and get your ticket punched.",3,2011,06,22
249,Simply Dreadfull - Avoid at all costs,"Please do not stay here - cheap prices but scruffy hotel, queues at check in with reception staff taking telephone bookings with up 6 people waiting!, used condoms outside bedroom window - nice touch!. 10 minutes wait for tea at breakfast, no plug in bath and book a 7 am wake up call get it at 7.20!!!!!

really, really poor",1,2011,06,02
249,Nice hotel spoilt by noisy drunken guests and poor management,"I stayed at the Clarion as I had to have a small surgical procedure in a nearbye hospital. It was a mistake, on checkin registered my credit card to pay for any additional items (that evening I had to again go to reception as my wife was refused bar service with guests and was very embarrassed).

The hotel don't do anything about noisy guests and there were adulsts and children screaming and shouting - argiung banging on doors etc until 4am. What the the hotel do nothing!!!

If you are a noisy drunken group that likes to annoy other people into the early hours the hotel is recommended - otherwise stay away!

Incidentally, this is my second stay at the hotel - the noise problem was similar although not so late on the previos occasion and I put that down to a one off because there were a large number of canoists on the first occasion.",1,2011,05,27
249,FANTASTIC,"I just had to let people no how wonderful this hotel is, my husband, our two childre 12 and 9 and myself stayed here last weekend, the staff were so helpful in the hotel but most of all I must complement the leisure centre staff, my goodness they were so happy and friendly at all times, smiles for all customers. On the Saturday night there was a ""JEWARD PARTY"" for everyone, my kids had a brillant time, thank you to all at the Clarion Liffey Valley  I  will return very soon again.",5,2011,05,18
249,Good value,"I was a little scared after reading all the reviews on here about this hotel, but was pleasantly surprised. No they do not have AC in rooms but fan was provided in the room and there was no hassle for them to give us another one. Some of the rooms have balconies on them where you can open up the door and get more air in there.  The beds aren't comfortable but linens are. You can ask for an extra pad and they will give it to you.  We ended up switching rooms after the 2nd night and they upgrades us to one of the larger suites with a living room, balony, and small kitchen with no hassles.  Very accomodating.  We did walk to the mall often (the movie theater is great!) and would buy things from Boot's pharmacy to snack on that was next to the movie theater in the mall.  The Jimmy Rockets cafe, or whatever right near all that is open till late and that was really convenient since not much stays open past 8:00 any day.  We traveled with my parents who had a separate room...they have larger taxis to accomodate and we got around the city smoothly for usually about 18 to 22 Euro...splitting it made it just as well as doing the bus with less of the hassle and loss of time.  The cabbies do appear to charge 1 Euro per person FYI.  Some taxi drivers were more pleasant than others.  The pool hours were somewhat of a hassle because kids could only go from 9-7 and we always got back too late. Oh well.  We stayed so busy anyway that I didn't really miss the pool anyways.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and found everyone very helpful and nice.  
I read on here that they didn't have high speed internet but we were able to use our WIFI just fine on the lower level....when we moved to larger room we couldn't get the wifi to work but were able to plug in just fine and were not charged anything for internet use.",5,2011,05,18
249,exceeded our expectations,"great food, friendly staff, even though the hotel was very busy it didn't feel like it.                             receptionist (geoffery) was extremely friendly and helpful. we had a meal on our last night and all of the staff especially our waitress was really nice. After reading some of the reviews here we were going to cancel our stay but decided not to and we were glad we didn't. This hotel we would recommend.",4,2011,05,18
249,great value beautiful hotel,bargin i will be back more like a 5 star hotel perfect for business trips in dublin are just relaxing greta gym and spa and swimming pool and tasty food great room service,5,2011,05,12
249,Best Hotel in Ireland,"Stayed at the Clarion on the 07th May 2011 with my husband and 2 children (7, 1). Being from Africa originally, reception on arrival was excellent. Patrick the receptionist was great. The family room (1 double and 2 twins) was clean and smelt fresh. Dinner which was included in the rate was excellent, very tasty and the service was quick and my children enjoyed the kiddie meals. Breakfast too was great. So overall this hotel is excellent and l would highly recommend it to everyone. Good value for money. l paid 119Euros for Dinner bed and breakfast for a family of four.",5,2011,05,09
249,Not a 4 Star Hotel,"Don't get me wrong this is not a bad hotel but it is definitely not a 4 star hotel as advertised. While we got a very good price on our stay here I think you could do better elsewhere. For such a new hotel the interior of the common areas was so sterile. The restaurant had the same menu out every night (not even a different special to change things up some bit). One item that really annoyed us that our room was so warm that we got hardly any sleep. We asked twice for it to be turned off (could not do it from our room). The first time we asked we were told ""no problem"". When it didn't happen we asked a second and were told it ""was not possible to turn it off as it is central heating"".",3,2011,05,08
249,Rude untrained staff,I stayed for 2 nights with family aged between 2 and 71 For a family event.the night time staff were so rude and so totally unhelpful.the prices varied each and every time we went to the bar.when i asked the reason i was told it was the tills fault ?.the bouncer's wouldnt allow some members of our group into the bar simply because they didnt want to.one member of our group was told if he wanted to complain he would be thrown out.The night time manager either couldn't or didn't want to speak english just stood there with his arms folded and smiling.the next morning the que for breakfast at 10am was 20 mins breakfast is served untill 11am  .when i eventually got seated there was not a lot of choice left.i had to ask for everything from cutlery to food.at one stage i was unsure why there was staff there as they did'nt wasnt to serve or help anybody.I have no idea how the hotel is holding on to its 4 star rating.I was totally exhausted by the time i got home.the only good thing i cud say about the hotel was that my room was large and clean.,2,2011,05,07
249,Nice but noisey and warm in rooms,"Spent a week night in Hotel - great location BUT difficult to get to sleep with the heat in room.
Then there was shouting / arguing in room overhead for a few hours - Eventually getting to sleep and being awoken by LOUD TV in next room at 630 am   and to top all this was being charged for car parking despite an abundance of spaces in a rural location UNLIKE a city centre establishment.",3,2011,05,07
249,"Excellent - staff, food, rooms, location","Having to travel regularly to Dublin for various appointments we have finally found a hotel that makes our trips a little easier. 
Clarion hotel Liffey Valley is a home away from home! The rooms are always quiet, ideal for good nights sleep, clean and comfortable.
The staff are very helpful and efficient and always respond to queries etc promptly.
The food is lovely.
It is a family friendly hotel.
Location is excellent - close enough to everything.
I would highly recommend this hotel for either business or pleasure.....
Also very good value!!!!!",5,2011,05,04
249,WOW! An absolute fab Easter Break for all the family!!!!,"Just had to put in writing our FAB experience that we had over the Easter weekend when we stayed in Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley. Have to admit we stayed here a few times before and were not dissappointed on any of the past visits to this hotel hence why we stayed again for Easter Weekend. On arrival the reception area was jammed but receptionists kept their heads and got through the queues quickly. When we got to our room there was a large cadbureys cream egg for each of our kids which was a very nice thought. That evening we ate in the restaurant and were very pleased with the service, food and prices. The variety was great and there was a wonderful buzz of excitement. Next morning after our large breakfast (which I highly recommend) we followed the crowds to a lrge room upstairs which was kitted out for an Easter Egg Hunt for residents of the Hotel. Each child from few months old-over 40s received many large eggs each and the excitement our kids experienced was class. There had to have been well over 250+kids in this room but again all the friendly staff had everything under control.Personally when kids happy then we are!! Check out was as quick as check in. I think it nice to comment on any hotel especially when you get quality and service for the price you pay. Check it out!!!Thankyou for reading my review.",5,2011,05,03
249,Acceptable 3 Star Budget Hotel.,"We stayed for one night during Easter holidays in a family room.  The family room had 3 beds, 2 single and 1 double which we were pleased with.  The room was an acceptable size for a city hotel and the en-suite bathroom was perfectly acceptable.  The cleaning is a bit hit and miss in this hotel.  There were stains on the bedroom carpet and stains on the throws on the beds.  The throws obviously do not get washed too often which I feel is disgusting. Of note, there was no air conditioning in the bedroom and consequently the bedroom was TOO HOT.  It was not possible to open the window more than approx. 2 inches so we chose to let the fan on all night to keep the room cooler. Breakfast was OK but I found some of the crockery to be unclean.   The scrambled eggs had too much salt added.  I didn't try the cooked food and opted for cereal, fruit, yogurt and croissants.  We had dinner in Synergie Restaurant in the hotel.  Sadly, the food is of a poor standard and the waitresses rather grumpy.  The Bar and the communal areas are bright and pleasing.  The hotel's location is approx a 30 mins bus ride from the city centre.  The Liffey Valley Shopping Centre nearby has a good selection of shops, ie. Boots, Marks & Spencer, Next, etc, a cinema and a few restaurants.  In summary, this is a decent hotel for Bed and Breakfast which is very keenly priced at the moment.  Its ideal for families with children and for short city breaks. However,  I certainly would not recommend eating in Synergie Restaurant.  I don't  have any complaints about the staff.  Service in the restaurant was OK but I did wait some time for my glass of wine.  Checking in and checking out went smoothly.  Overall, the hotel is quite pleasant and the location is tranquil so a good night's sleep is possible, if only the room hadn't been so hot.  Parking costs 4 euros for 24 hours.  I would stay in this hotel again but I most certainly would not eat in the Synergie Restaurant.  It's an acceptable budget hotel and what I would expect of a 3 Star hotel.",3,2011,05,02
249,Very rude restaurant staff especially the supervisor,"I stayed in this hotel over the easter break and found the room to be not very clean, the restaurant staff were very poor standard and the food was horrible the soup was very salty my pasta dish was very plain my husbands fish was very basic and came with no extras just a piece of salmon on the plate.
Our children were woken up by the restauant supervisor at 9.30 telling us we had to come down to pay for our drinks we asked if we could settle it in the morning as we were staying another night and were having breakfast. We were told no we had to come straight down there was no apology for disturbing us or waking our children they were extremly rude. The reception staff were not much better and didn't ask how our stay was when we left. I really hope this review is posted as i had read a few bad reviews about this hotel but i would really like to advise people that it is really not a good hotel and a complete waste of money there is no form of luxury in this hotel. The worst hotel ever.",1,2011,04,27
249,"Thanks to Patrick on Reception, he was most helpful!","We stayed at Clarion Liffey Valley last w/end, and I have to say big praise to Patrick on reeption, he was most accommodating, and very obliging. A pleasure to deal with !
Overall, would recommend this hotel.",5,2011,04,27
249,Terrible from the moment we arrived.,"Awful hotel. People running up and down the corridor shouting all night. Cot not in room and had to call 3 times, then go to reception. Do Not stay here.",1,2011,04,16
249,Pleasant Hotel everything as it says in ad but no A.C. & beds very hard,"Feel I need to let travellers know about this hotel. It definetly is a very nice hotel; everything on their site is true and food is very good. If you, like myself and my husband, don't like too much heat then be careful as there is no Air Conditioning and the window in our room only opened a few inches and air couldn't get into room. It was stifling even though it was April so beware if you want some cool. The one other thing we have to say is that the beds were extremely hard and after a long car journey would have liked to have a bit of softness to sleep in.",3,2011,04,15
249,Nice Visit to the Clarion,"Stayed here over Paddys Weekend with 2 young kids for a break and we stayed in the apartments and enjoyed our stay.  Value was good for an apartment with a pull out bed and a cot provided for the kids.  The sitting room was a really good size and the bedroom was good too.  Even the bed was pretty ok compared to some hotels Ive slept in.  

A fridge and microwave and a bit of cutlery helps when you have a growing 2 year old.

No problems with staff/service at all although we did not have much call to use them.  Brekkie was ok and the staff were helpful here.

The pool is a good size and my only complaint here was that they had 2 lanes closed for lane swimming taking up half the pool and only 2 people using them while swimming lessons took up another quarter leaving about 20 of us stuck in another quarter of the pool.  Sunday had only one lane closed so it was much better.

It would be nice if one of the workers in the pool recognised the fact that only 2 people were lane swimming and gave them one lane only.

Paid parking is a joke no matter how small the cost per night......Mahangers of the hotel please note it puts people off coming to the hotel if they have to pay for parking on top of everything else

All and all a nice visit-would recommend the apts for families",4,2011,03,30
249,Save your hard earned cash,"Stayed with my wife and son for one night  thank God it was not for any longer. Room got very warm during the night and there was a lot of noise from the corridor and from outside. Include in our stay was evening meal when we got to the bar  I mean resturant we were told we had to order from the black menu , I can honestly say that the food was pathetic , I dont eat much at the best of times but what us offered to us was the smallest protions and the most tasteless fair I have ever been given, breakfast was not much better and to top it of we had to pay for the privilege to park at this awful hotel. When I checked out I felt I had just throw away my hard earned cash .",1,2011,03,26
249,"Great value, excellent location, definately worth going again","The hotel staff were wonderful, very helpful with all requests including locations an directions to anywhere we asked. The televsions in the room have all the basic cable channels and a selection of music. The Arc cafe bar less than 5 minutes walk away has fantastic food at great prices. The breakfast and lunch in the hotel were quite nice also",5,2011,03,16
249,Nice room but poor service,"I spent Valentine's night in the Clarion with my girlfriend. The Valentine's deal unfortunately did not live up to our expectations. The room was acceptable but we were very disappointed by, what I consider, the early closing time of the leisure facilities (7pm on Valentine's Day). The 'romantic' dinner also left a lot to be desired. The restaurant had no real atmosphere and the service was not great. Part of the meal included a glass of sparkling wine each, which despite repeated requests was only delivered half way through dessert! All in all, not what I'd expect from a four star.",3,2011,03,14
249,Girly/shopping weekend.,"Myself (30's) and my teenaged daughter stayed at the Clarion and thought it was lovely. The pool was busy, but nice, and larger than we'd expected, and the sauna etc. was fab. Dinner was included in the offer we booked, and the choice of meal was good - and the food itself was lovely. Breakfast was a buffet-style affair, everything from the typical cooked fare to cold hams and salami, cheeses, yoghurts, fruit and little pastries. The room was immaculate with a safe and a small fridge, tea/coffee, and tv - just be careful not to hit pay-per-use channels or internet by accident :) Interconnecting rooms are available for larger families. Bathroom/shower was lovely, clean with Dove handwash& showergel, and the towels were soft. The beds were very comfy. Kiddies facilities looked excellent. TIPS: The Liffey Valley Shopping centre and cinema is barely 10mins walk from the Clarion - so walk! If you want the City Centre, there's a big OBVIOUS fly-over footbridge from the Liffey Valley to cross the road to the BUS-STOP that has a steady supply of buses to and from Town for a couple of euro. Seriously. You're in Dublin. Use the bus. Only crazy people use cabs and then complain about the price. The location for shopping is great, as the Liffey Valley really has everything right there (including plenty of choice for food and drink)",5,2011,03,03
249,Good Value for Money,"I stay at this hotel about once a month having originally picked it as it is very close to the business I visit on the nearby retail park. At 59 euros a night it is considerably cheaper than the Travelodges and Premier Inns I usually stay at in England. For your money you get a large well appointed room including tea & coffee with biscuits (you don't get those at TL or PI anymore!), a fridge, a safe and plenty of space. The room is of a size and style you'd expect in a much more expensive hotel. The hotel also has a bar, restaurant, swimming pool etc. 
Yes, the corridors are long (lots of big rooms to fit in); you have to pay for the carpark; there's no free wi-fi in the rooms etc. But remember, it is only 59 euros a night. The breakfast is nothing special but at 10 euros not overly expensive. The nearby retail park has lots of places to eat so all in all this hotel is good value for money!",4,2011,03,02
249,AN ENJOYABLE BREAK,Friendly helpful staff with clean comfortable spacious rooms. Lovely pool which the children really enjoyed. We really enjoyed our stay.,5,2011,02,27
249,Great short break,Love this hotel our weekend away was a great success. We stayed in a family room plenty of room and good quality. We were on a room only rate so bought one of their voucher sheets for ten euro which gave us some discounts in the bar and restaurant so eating  in the hotel worked out cheap enough. Kids used the pool and games room in the hotel and had the shops and cinema across the road. Worth a return visit.,4,2011,02,21
249,bloody brilliant. That is all.,"Even though its about a  40minute bus ride to the city centre, this hotel is lovely! With a shopping centre being a 5minute walk away, and a bar, off-licence & restaurant on the site, you don't need to go far. The staff are friendly and happy to help, and the irish accent will never get old.",4,2011,02,19
249,Just a list,"Booked Room: Double - Smoking

- Wireless LAN is almost everywhere. Not here! The Clarion has only one access to the internet with a cable. NO GO in 21st century!
- Because of a disability I asked for help bringing my suitcase up to the room -and Thank God I did so, ‘cause it was the longest way to a room I’ve ever walked. 
- Patchier/Filthier carpet all the way down
-  Dirt (mold) underneath the soap holder 
- Never trust a toilet if it's not your own! Same here - brinks from last cleaning suggest germs... 
- Had to ring for an ashtray 
- No bin in our room, renounced to ring for it as I already begged for the ashtray and !three times! for my suitcase. (Ashtray was quicker!)
- No PAY-TV available with Laser Card
- Just notice the crustal dirt spot on the glass after I've had the first sip.
- Uncomfortable pillows, quite worn mattress

At least staff is very friendly.",2,2011,02,15
249,disgrace..food awful and staff rude.,"stayed in clarion hotel liffey valley with family and freinds for a birthday first of having to pay for car parking is a disgrace ,rooms very basic no shampoo etc....corridors to rooms dirty smell of wont say lifts and walls filty ..food at party was a disgrace 20.00 euro a head alot of people felt ill after food .bar staff were the rudest i have ever come across .i would never stay in this hotel again even if the rooms were free.",1,2011,02,08
249,could be much better!!!,"Firstly location for this hotel is ok...close to the shopping centre  ut its a 10-15 min walk. The hotel charges for parking and its underground. This is recession times and this should be complementary. Check in was slow..one person working trying to do everything. 
The room was ok...typical clarion style however the bathroom was poor...the soap was watered down and splattered my clothes and went all over the floor...it could also have been cleaned much better.
Checkout was terribly slow....so many workers looking at each other opposed to working..Management needs to be better.
This hotel is far outside dublin..the hotel does not provide transport to the city and a taxi will cost at leat 20 euros each way.
Prices need to reflect the times and need to be lower.
Small changes could make this hotel brilliant.",3,2011,02,06
249,Dirty smelly and so untidy!,"We stayed here for one night,it was our third time staying here and our last. It has gone downhill big time,the corridors were full of trays of breakfast and dinners left out.They were still there 12 hrs later and the smell from them was bad. The amount of half bottles of drink left along the corridors imagine what would happen if a child picked it up! The fire alarm kept going off at night got no sleep.The breakfast was poor stay away from the frys they look like they were there for days. Stay well away from this smelly,untidy hole!",1,2011,02,03
249,Its just ok,"I needed an overnight stay in dublin and at 59euro you can't complain about the price. The hotel reception is lovely and bright, rooms are spacious and clean. The bed is rock hard and one pillow is a little mean in my opinion. The rooms are basic and functional and there are no toileteries just a dove shampoo/conditioner/body wash all in one squeezy thing on the wall. If you need somewhere to stay but you are not looking for luxury this place is ideal. If you are looking for somewhere a little bit special this is not the place for you...",3,2011,01,30
249,"Clean, comfortable and great value!","This was my third stay in this hotel.  I ended up making a last minute reservation and was a bit frazzled when I arrived at the hotel. I was greated by a very friendly receptionist Martha and began to feel relaxed immediatley.  I stayed in an executive suite for (€94) which was basically 2 rooms connected by a short hall.  The bedroom was large and comfortable and had a large TV and desk area.  The second room had a small kitchenette and large sitting area with another television and desk area.  The kitchenette had a refrigerator, microwave and toaster as well as cutlery and dishes. The suite was sparkling and very comfortable.  There was high speed in room internet access and WiFi in the public areas of the hotel.  All the staff I encountered during my stay were friendly and helpful. Despite being in an urban area, there was little noise and I had a very comfortable sleep. Check in and check out were quick and painless even though this was a busy hotel
The hotel is very close to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which has a cinema, food court and restaurants in addition to shops.  I was driving so access to the city centre wasn't a problem. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would plan to stay here again.",5,2011,01,28
249,Wouldn't call it a four star hotel,"We have stayed here several times, no major complaints.
Staff are polite.
Rooms are nice. Our shower curtain could have been a bit cleaner, very old looking and had stains on it. Noticed black (maybe mould) around part of the bath. Very minimal on the complimentary toiletries....no conditioner, no shower cap. Container of Dove hand wash & shower gel/shampoo (hate the stuff that's combined, it's either shower gel or shampoo!). I wouldn't be surprised if they refilled the containers with ""cheap stuff"".
The gym is huge. Pool is ok. Noticed rubbish around the pool area. Children were allowed to jump off the surrounding tiled walls (an accidnet waiting to happen), life guard did not stop them. Pool is good if you can't swim as it is all one depth. Towels are supplied too. Changing room was a bit smelly.
We ate in the Kudos restaurant, food was tastey. Service not so good, we were waiting for about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table. Arc bar accross the road from hotel serves nice food & service is 10 times better. Also a nice place to go for a few drinks as it's a late bar.
Security man at hotel was a bit rude. We were waiting outside to get in and he stood looking at us repeating ""yes, hello, yes, hello"". Could have asked to see our room card to confirm we were guests....we had to ask to be let in.
And one more bad point....u HAVE to pay for PARKING!! First time we stayed at this hotel we did not have to pay, I don't remember paying the 2nd time we stayed. On the Saturday we wanted to take the car out & our carpark ticket was validated for us but when checking out on the Sunday we were told we had to pay. It's only 4 euro but I think if you are a guest parking should be free.
Room was good value, if we got the same deal I would stay again but otherwise I know many nicer 4 star hotels around that I would choose before here.",3,2011,01,24
249,Great hotel for weary travelers unable to get to Heathrow for bad weather,"The Clarion Liffey Valley did a great job with us and several other families.  We were stranded when flights to London were diverted because of bad weather.  We stayed two nights at the Clarion and it was excellent.  The accommodation was excellent, the staff extremely helpful, the food outstanding, the service friendly, and the manager (I forget her name) went the extra mile.  During a weekend when thousands were stranded at Heathrow, we were the lucky ones.  The diversion to Dublin became a pleasure, largely in part because of this hotel and its staff.  Thank you for your hospitality during our short, unplanned and unexpected diversion to Dublin.  The Clarion Liffey Valley turned a crisis into a joy.",5,2011,01,03
249,no internet,stayed over new year with my wife when we booked in the room we were given smelled of smoke and smoke detector was covered i persume by previous occupant with a bag told reception and she gave us another room internet was not working told reception they said it was down and was been worked on contacted reception 3 times during stay about this over next  2 days same story wasnt bothered just casually said still not working  also you have to pay to park your car 4 euros per 24 hours this should be free to residents  the  hotel is ok  for the price but nothing special only plus you can walk to liffey valley and cinema,3,2011,01,02
249,A nice hotel for the price.,"We booked this hotel with a flight for a package deal and it was a great value! It was not right in the center of Dublin, but one only has to take a 20 minute bus ride to get down town. The staff was very accommodating throughout the whole trip. We arrived at 6am and check-in wasn't until the afternoon, but they let us into another open room. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful with directions, places to see in the area and in Dublin, and helpful with looking up our flight status the night before leaving. The breakfast (which wasn't included in our room fee but was reasonable for  11 euros ) was excellent! There was a huge selection of meats, eggs, fruit, yogurt, etc. 
The rooms were very clean and the housekeeping was attentive when we asked for additional items. The only complaint was that it was loud on a Saturday night because of the Kudos night club connected to the hotel. Although it wasn't a plush hotel, it was a great value and clean and comfortable. We would recommend this hotel for those that want a moderate hotel (no frills/spa treatment) for a reasonable price!",4,2010,12,26
249,"Nice price, but not great","I booked this hotel for the location, as its very close to the shopping centre, having to pay for parking was a bit off a pain but with the price for the hotel you could factor it in. The room was clean, but every time you left the room it seemed like someone was smoking outside your door, even tho it was an non-smoking floor!! The bar staff where very nice and where well able to chat!! Breakfast had a good range, but staff seemed rushed and unsure. The let down for the weekend was the restaurant, staff never asked was the food ""ok"" at any point, steak was well over cooked amd had to ask for the wine three times. I would stay again, but would eat somewhere else.",3,2010,12,22
249,"OK, not 4-Star but good all the same","As other reviewers have pointed out, a 4-Star rating for this hotel is a little generous and it lacks several of the features you would expect from a 4-Star hotel. But let's be honest, do you expect 4-Star treatment for 60-70 Euros per night?!? Get real.
This hotel is fine. My room (on the ground floor) was a decent size, smell free and clean. Bedding and the bed were fine. TV was OK though lacking the range on channels I would like and the room lighting was just sufficient to read by in bed (so often the bed side lighting is very poor in hotels). The shower took several minutes to run hot but that was no real problem. Check-in/out was slow due to only one person on reception. The underground car park kept our car snow free but I object to being charged when I'm a resident.
The bar area is very nice and serves excellent food but it's not the place if you're looking for a romantic meal for two (unless your romance includes Sky Sports). Good Thai restaurant (Lemon Grass) faces the hotel and is a 2-min walk (in the snow).
No wireless (at least not in my room) but the wired access was free and very good.
I didn't try the pool.
I'd certainly not hesitate to stay there again.",4,2010,12,10
249,Awful Experience - not a 4* hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with my wife and 1 year old son in November 2010 and we won't be staying there again.  The hotel claims to be a 4* hotel but it is very far from that.  The receptionist was very nice and welcoming, but I can honestly say that that was the only nice experience of our stay there.

Our room was a decent size but lacked any homeliness or comfort about it.  The room was on the ground floor and our window was right next to the car park where trucks came to make deliveries even late at night.  The bathroom was extremely basic, none of the usual toileteries you would expect from a 4* hotel, just wash bottles attached to the wall.  The bath/shower were really dirty, the grouting in the tiles was black and a lot of the shower curtain was red from mildew - I wouldn't dare let my own bathroom get this dirty so I shouldn't accept this from a 4* hotel.

We booked a double room in the hotel but once we got in to it we realised that it was 2 single beds pushed together - not a double bed and not great for any romance!

The most annoying thing about our stay was housekeeping walking in to our room at 08:00 in the morning to come ""make our beds"" and walking our baby in the process.  This type of thing really annoys me, in my opinion they do this deliberately in order to wake us and get us out of the hotel.

You can also hear everything that is going on in the corridor from inside the hotel room.  There was a guy talking on his mobile phone at a decent distance from our room but yet we could both hear his conversation really clearly.

The hotel has a leisure centre but it is in need of some refurishment.  The changing rooms smell and the benches are in need of some paint.  In the pool area the ceilings have a lot of mildew and damp stains.  On the night we stayed there the facilities closed at 7:30...well actually it's supposed to close at 08:00 but in fact the pool attendant asked to leave the pool at 7:30!

This is the first hotel I've stayed in which has a carpark in the grounds of the hotel but yet is not free!  When we drove in to the car park we got a ticket from the machine at the entrance barrier and assumed it was free until we seen a car park ticketing machine in reception.

We got the buffet breakfast here but most of the food was completely dried up eventhough we were there half an hour before it was due to close.  There was a good choice of pastries, cereals, juices, etc.

This is an awful hotel  which we definitely won't be staying in again.",2,2010,11,25
249,Pros and Cons to styaing here,"I spent a Saturday night in The Clarion Liffey Valley in September. We got a deal of €99 for room with breakfast and evening meal.
Hotel is next to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and a few other bars and restaurants so not a bad location but not in the city centre either.
Check in was a bit crazy with a few minutes wait. We were upgraded to an Execuite room which had limited kitchen facilites and a patio area in the top floor. Room was nice and large with nice decor but a little grubby (sofa and carpet not the cleanest).
The strangest thing was that we liked the idea of the little roof garden/patio which the room opened onto via sliding doors but there was no key to lock these doors. I rang reception and told them I would like the key to these doors so I could lock them. They said that someone would be right up, we left the room for the evening and arrived back about 11 to find them still unlocked. When I rang down I was given no apology and was told there would be someone up to lock them. A man arrived and proceeded to wrestle with the door for about 10 minutes and announced that he couldn't lock them and we should just sleep with the door unlocked! This was not an option for me and he eventually got another guy who locked the door. We were then told we couldn't keep the key in case it went missing! I just found all of this a bit unprofessional for a large hotel who obviously deal with such issues on a daily basis, I was very tired and frustrated by the time we eventually got the problem sorted!
On a positive note the food in the restaurant was very nice, I probably wouldn't stay here again though.",3,2010,11,24
249,WHAT A NIGHTMARE AT NIGHT!,Can you imagine staying at a hotel and being unable to sleep for three nights in a row? This is the case  of this hotel due to a match  which took place over the weekend and its supporters who did not stop screaming and shouting for three nights!,3,2010,11,15
249,Lovely Hotel with good location,"Hotel staff were very pleasent at check in and very helpful giving directions for good shopping!  Room was gorgeous and spacious, plenty of room for bags, bed was very comfy and there was even a seperate area with chairs and a small table!  Bathroom was nice and roomy and very modern and clean.  Food in the hotel was lovely, we had a meal included so we ate in the main restraunt, top quality food!  The hotel is just a 5 min walk from the liffey valley shopping centre, which is a lovely place for some retail therapy!  very nice hotel and location. would definately stay again!",5,2010,11,11
249,"Good location, but  basic big hotel chain","Checked in early delighted room was ready nice suprise seperate room for the kids with kitchenette. We had requested a NON SMOKING ROOM !!!
We has a deal which included dinner on one night     food although mine was quite tasty very basic roughly presented not much of a restaurant standard. Husbands meal was chicken overcooked may have been under the heat lamps.
Pool busy with lots of kids was amazed at how slippy the tiles were saw a good few kids slip.
Second night  we were woken about 12 to the noise of the neighbouring room and the strong smell of smoke it seemed to be coming through the head board. We phoned security who asked the people in the room if they needed to smoke to please open the window!!! This was despite the fact it was meant to be a non-smoking floor.
Mentioned this on check out didn't get much satisfaction. 
Would not be in a hurry to return.",2,2010,11,08
249,excellent value - but busy and noisey on Saturday nights,"Booked before reading tripadvisor reviews and was terrified of going after all the bad reviews.  Went with family on a package one night break.  Food was excellent for the evening meal and breakfast.  Noise outside on corridors during the night that woke some of us.  21st party on in hotel on Sat night.  My only complaint was that the hotel was cold that included resturant, bar, lobby and bedroom.  Think parking should be free for hotel quests - the fee is 4e for 24 hrs. But overall we were impressed with the value we received and would return again.",4,2010,11,07
249,"Regular chain hotel; want you in, take your money, want you out.","We stayed here for one night as we were attending a function in the hotel. 

Negatives: 
1) The meal at the function was terrible. I have worked in large hotels that can cater up to 500 people and there is no excuse for lacklustre food. I had salad for starters, no issues expect that there was no pinenuts as stated on the menu. The main course; turkey&ham were dry, the potatoes were nice but the vegetables were still frozen. The dessert was terrible; I honestly would never make something like that myself. It was apple pie made with sponge, a sliver of tasteless tiramasu and a lump of cream. 
2) When the waitress was serving the main course, she put two dinners on our table which must have been meant for another table as the manager started giving out to her right beside our table. 
3) Not once during our meal did anyone come over to ask was everything okay with the meal. 
4) The bar did last orders at 12.30 and we asked a staff member was the resident's bar open and we were told yes; went down stairs ( about 2am ) and it wasn't.
5) Impersonal service, the bar staff were nice but not professional. The receptionist on checkout was nice but never asked did we have a nice stay etc. 
6) Just a personal opinion but I don't think staff should work on front desk unless they are fluent in English. We were having issues with the car-park ticket machine (taking our money but not registering it) and the staff couldn't assist us as they couldn't understand. 

Positives: 
1) Nice big bed, very comfortable.
2) The function on the tv to see the bill etc was impressive. 
3) Overnight parking was only €4.00 . 

I always seem to be dissappointed by large chain hotels. I hate feeling like a number, get in, give us your money and get out. I noticed on arrival that the Clarion is a member of Optimus - which I was impressed with; perhaps they should invest some of that learning into the customer service side of things.",3,2010,10,23
249,Clarion Liffey valley Fireworks!,This hotels security leaves a lot to be desired to say the very least. While my friends and I were walking into the hotel at approx.12.00pm my freind was struck by a firework thrown from the balcony on the second floor where a 30th birthday party was taking place. He recieved burns to his stomach and arm and his jacket was ruined. He was lucky the firework didn't strike him in the face as he would have undoubtable been blinded. My probelm with the hotel was the fact that these scumbags were allowed to enter the premisise with fireworks on their person and that there obviously was no security at the party.Also that night a group of youngsters were allowed to run amuck around the hotel shouting and knocking on all the doors. I would srongly recomend to people to avoid this hotel and area like the plague.,2,2010,10,18
249,Not great,"I travelled with my wife to Dublin and as it suited our needs we stayed at the Liffey Valley hotel over the weekend primarily due to its location and the deal we got with AXA Leisure. We have stayed here before and obviously our experience was good – otherwise we wouldn’t have returned.

As I was going to a conference on Saturday morning I was up early but time first for a quick shower- all very good but there was only one set of towels in the bathroom. The bath mat was rolled up and a health & safety sign on the wall telling you to use it. When I rolled out the mat it was filthy. In fairness both issues were addressed quickly when brought to the attention of hotel staff. 

Away with me down for breakfast; the choice looked very good until I came to the “hot” counter. Firstly the plates were wet and cold and it didn’t end there- the food was cold also!! How could you have cold sausages and rashers, etc.  at the start of the breakfast session? Looked like the food was precooked the night before and I had arrived before the under heaters had warmed it up-this is the only explanation I can think of.  My wife had her breakfast later on and she found the food cold also. Breakfast on the second morning, in fairness, was very good and hot as well.

Our stay on the second night was like something out of a movie. There was a large group at a function at the hotel and the noise started early. Surely it would quieten down as these situations tend to do and hotel security would deal with it. Well staff appeared to be absent and not in control of the situation. With such a large gathering no addition resources seemed to have been allocated to this function which was surprising. Ah well it couldn’t get any worse…………………..well it did. Around 1.30 the blue lights appeared; an ambulance was needed and also the Guards; who called in their helicopter. This came and hoovered above the hotel and the surrounding area on a number of occasions. Sirens wailed until about 4am around the area. It appeared this crowd might have been local and my fear is that this type of “event” could be commonplace. 

On checking out I was waiting to be asked” did you enjoy your stay” but not a word. I’m sure staff were well aware of the terrible events that took place the night before and did not want to invite any comments. My wife did leave a comment card which was supposed to be handed into the manager’s office but decide not to make a scene as we were both exhausted at this stage and just wanted to get away from the hotel 

I have an idea that this type of trouble might occur regurlarly at weekends",3,2010,10,18
249,lovely hotel - great location!,"we're just back afta our 3 night stay at the clarion liffey valley, we got the B&B rate which was a big mistake, the breakfast wasn't great there to be honest, its a pity, coz its a buffet breakfast!  the hotel itself if quite nice, the rooms are clean and spacious!!!

we had our little man with us, and we brought him to "" THE LITTLE GYM"" which is right next door to the hotel - on the grounds of the hotel, well he loved it!!! its a class for small kids, there were classes available to suit kids all ages, the parents attend the class too with the child.. i would advise these for all kids.. and parents too :-)   

the parking was great, really cheap, - first 3 hours free... and afta that is dirt cheap!!!!

hotel is really close to the lovely liffey valley shopping centre. and close enuf to IKEA!!! 

will defintly return to the clarion liffey valley but will just go for the room only rate!!!",5,2010,10,09
249,excellent again.,stayed here with my fiance and my two year old. Friendly greeting at check in and check out. the room couldnt have been better. ordered from the dine in menu which was lovely. we booked room only and it only cost us 60e for all 3 of us to stay for one night. i thought this was excellent considering the standard of the room. very comfortable beds. very quiet. will definatly be back :),5,2010,10,05
249,Great just don't go at the weekends!,"My wife and I stayed there on a Friday night because were going shopping to Ikea the following day. Everything was fine until 2.30 am when there was a fight between some women in the corridor which went on until around 4, also the water pump in the bedroom beside us was as loud as a fog horn.

I have stayed in this hotel previously mid week and I have found it satisfactory, with no fights or fog horns!

Another Trip Advisor tip: Don't try to shop in Ikea on a Saturday after 4 hours sleep!",3,2010,09,21
249,irresponsible and lax.  SECURE PARKING A JOKE (amongst other things),"booked 3 night family stay for my partner, 3yr old and 7 month old.  room average but very stuffy.  communal areas not overly clean and hotel in need of a lick of paint.  booked a ""crib"" but got a travel cot-thought ok until i noticed how grubby it was with ?? i do not wish to know-thank goodness I brought my own!!  kept awake by party goers on sat night-let it go for an hour before visiting reception where the manager got it quickly sorted.  food ok.  staff ok but all not overly friendly-not even returning the best smiles from our 2 kids.  WORST TO COME  had to pay 12 euros for the priviledge of getting my car broken into and damaged in the hotels own secure carpark.  whole situation handled terribly asked for garda to be phoned waited for hour or 2 then had to put kids to bed- requested we be contacted when garda arrived-still waiting and now back home.  very cross esp when told that garda had called to hotel but no explanation as to why we weren't notified!!  MORE STILL  partner went to car park and noticed my car was parked between 2 cctv cameras-happy days-NOT- manager informed us that the cameras where pointing away from car-did ask what was the point of the cameras if they did not show whole carpark-still waiting for reply.  then informed that another car had windows smashed same weekend.  these people knew what they where doing the way they broke into my car.  very dissapointing end to our very 1st family holiday and stay in a hotel.  difficult to explain to a 3 year old that the ""bad boys"" that damaged mummys car where gone and would cause him no harm-he was quite upset.  oh and to add insult the hotel did not offer any refund at all not even the 12 euros. stay clear of this hotel (with your car anyway)",2,2010,09,16
249,"Very very bad, go to Louis Fitzgerald hotel instead","Although we made the reservation in advanced and let the hotel know that we would arrive in the evening, when we showed up at about 08:00PM, there were no rooms available and they had to send us to another hotel. There is a disabled person in my family, so we asked for a special room for him when we made the reservation, and because of the hotel overbooking, not only there wasn't a room fitting for disabled, but there were no rooms at all! We are extremely upset of that service and not intend to stay there in the future.
The only good thing they did is that they sent us to  Louis Fitzgerald hotel - which was very good and very recommended",1,2010,09,14
249,Excellent get away,"Stayed here end of August for last getaway before kids went back to school.Kids loved it, great pool and kids club. Food was excellent and got a really good family deal. Stayed in the apartments which are perfect with loads of space. Location is good for day trip to Zoo, movies  and shopping just 2 min walk away.
Would highly recommend and kids are already asking about when we are going back.",5,2010,08,29
249,No class 4*,"We checked in on 22nd August on a 3 night package including an evening meal . The room allocated to us was small and stuffy and although beds were made with clean sheets the room certainly had not being properly serviced. The decorative cushions, throws over the beds and some pillow cases were stained. The bedside lockers and lamps were coated with dust and underwear from previous guests was still in one of the drawers. The window could only be opened a touch and even with a floor fan provided the room was like a sauna. The TV would ""freeze"" constantly during a programme and only one of the key cards worked to enter the room. Someone entered our room the next morning at 08:15am and after querying this at reception I was told it would have being the cleaners and to prevent this I have to leave the ""maybe later"" sign on the door knob.

I could not fault the food in the Sinergie restaurant however meal times would have being more enjoyable if the staff would keep the trolley baring plastic containers used to collect the ""leftover"" food at a distance!!! 
On the last night of our stay (24th of August) we were forced to leave the Kudos bar due to a party booked for an ""Ethnic Group"" which turned rowdy. This also resulted in one under age child bringing bottles of budweiser out of the building although extra security guards were on duty.... My 7 year old daughter tried to use the ladies room in the lobby but was intimidated by a group of girls sitting on the sink area worktops and not allowing access to sinks or hand dryers. 
To add insult to injury residents are charged for car parking at the rate of €4.00 per day (which I find absolutely appalling) but on the night of the 24th of August the barrier was left up for their ""group"" to leave peacefully (including help from the Garda)
This was my second time staying in the Clarion Hotel and I certainly have no plans to return with my family.",2,2010,08,27
249,sleepless nigts-shattered staff,"We just returned from 3 night break at this place, have been there lots of times before but is deteriorating slowly but surely.  Biggest problem being LACK OF STAFF and proper preparation. Staff seem pushed to the limit.Had to wait forever for dinner with 3 children, one of them having autism and he doesnt do waiting, but there was no opportunity to salvage situation, Told no need to book table and then at dinig room being asked have we made reservation?? crazy, communication just crap and management seriously need to review this.  food ok considering fiasco in rest, my husband is exec chef in 4* hotel and couldnt believe his eyes with shortage of staff to clean tables etc.  Could see gm there many hrs every day but not actually so.rting problem. noise outside main door most of the night. itinerants hanging around shouting and roaring till early hrs, not a breath of air in room. frozen tv pictures, Just unworthy of 4* title.  In praise rooms were clean , think we were lucky as we had exec suite , breakfast actually very good despite massive queue, meant we couldnt relax in morning had to rush down to get place.  In general great place to stay in winter time off season if you are heavy sleeper, and also would be nervous withou my husband as its open door for unpleasant members of our society.",2,2010,08,27
249,Comfortable Stay,Stayed on a 1 night B&B and Dinner package. Kids enjoyed the pool etc. and the dinner and breakfast were good. Hotel has a good location to break up the trip further south.,4,2010,08,23
249,Return trip already planned!!,"We stayed here in early August on recommendation of other family members - there was 20 in all in the family party including older and younger kids. The hotel is near to a wide range of amenties - zoo, shopping centre with cinema, fortlucan and city centre so catered for all the age ranges.Hotel was clean, spacious and although exteremly busy staff were on the ball, very family friendly and full of local info. Our family have booked to stay here again in Oct Midterm.",5,2010,08,23
249,Pleasantly Suprised,"We had booked the Clarion Liffey Valley and after reading some of the recent reviews I was worried. On arrival the hotel was impressive and clean. Our room was spacious, clean and had nice decor. We were delighted with the hotel, staff were great, food excellent and the hotel had alot to offer. The kids had a great time in the pool and the kids room. We ate in Kudos the first night - we choose the cinema meal deal option - great value €19.95 for 2 courses and cinema ticket, asain food was great. Second night we ate in Sinergie another good meal. We meet alot of other families who had come back for a second and third visit. Great hotel, we will be back",5,2010,08,23
249,4 star shambles,"Pleasent staff greeted us on our check in....even though there was a long wait and we booked dinner in restauraunt (sinergie) for 6pm that evening.  After a 3 hour drive we were tired and hungry.  On arrival to our room - it was musty, reeking of stale cigarette smoke and there was no air conditioning.  In fact there was no air conditioning in the hotel at all.  The picture on the television was was constantly ""freezing"" and the bathroom had none of the ""branded toiletries"" that the website was talking about when we booked this place.  Not to mention the fact that the bath was hideously narrow and the ""shower"" consisted of a hose attached to the taps of the bath and not attached to the wall! Deluxe room?? I think not
On arrival to the restaraunt, we were greeted with a sullen waitress who questioned the timing of our reservation.  There was another family behind us waiting to get seated also.  There was no greeting and we were not shown to our table.....we were shouted at across the dining room ""guys over here"". when we got to our table there were 2 pieces of paper on a clip board (this was the menu) and the waitress was gone.  The menu was limited to say the least.  Imagine my mirth to find out that this was the a la Carte menu and the only thing different on it from the set menu was a breast of chicken??? - Totally hideous.  We got up and left and ate in the Arc Cafe Bar that evening and most other evenings also...we also ate breakfast there every morning as the queue in the hotel every morning was snaking out halfway into reception!!
We mentioned our grievances to the general manager who was shocked at our experiences..and he gave us complimentary dinner the following night.  It was the same sullen waitress that served our table for our complimentary meal...............which was below average to say the least.  We were still hungry after it.
The tin hat on all of it was on our last day there we had a cup of coffee in the bar where there were pastries on display..............there were also an assortment of flies and bluebottles having a taste of these pastries which were duly served to customers ......We left .......rapidly NEVER to return.  Sleep was an impossiblity also and in general the place is a dirty rundown building........to be honest i think its a health and safety risk and should be reported.",1,2010,08,22
249,"dirty breakfast plates/cups, bad swimming pool for children","Our family of 2 adults, 3 children aged between 6 to 9, stayed for 3 nights. Pool too deep at 1.4 metres with no supervision most of day for children,childrens pool too shallow for children to swim in. On asking a Sinergie restaurant supervisor to arrange for clean plates to be brought out at breakfast, explaining others were dirty, there was no apology or a smile. A very busy Sinergie restaurant for breakfast with waiters and waitresses obviously overworked and as such there was a lack of friendliness amongst most staff, including a manager. I suspect the managerial team, above the restaurant supervisors have an style of management which results in subordinate staff being unhappy in their  workplace, after witnessing an unpleasant exchange in the sinergie restaurant between a manager and waitress. Poor waitress. Breakfast queues very long after 10am. Evening dinner menu did not change for the 3 evenings we stayed and was limited in choice. If only we had stayed elsewhere or even remained at home. A never again hotel.",2,2010,08,20
249,"Dirty, disappointing and in dire need of...","Dirty, disappointing and in dire need of some descent staff. First room allocated was not clean - moved to a better room which had stains on carpet and walls. Breakfast room staff - cleaned leftover food into clear plastic bowls beside where we and others were eating. NOT good if you have a weak stomach. The breakfast staff also sprayed cleaner from a distance onto tables - didn't think to remove the jugs of milk that others had to use 5 minutes later and cleaned around the salt/pepper & cups - didn't bother to remove them n clean the entire table.    ",2,2010,08,19
249,Sweat house hotel...,stayed here with my wife and kids and its the most unplesant place to stay..NOTICE...THIS HOTEL HAS NO AIR CONDITIONING!!!!!!...the place is sweaty and stuffy the windows only open and inch and there were several people complaining about this but the hotel is impossible to sleep in.  The hotel also charges you for carparking which is really maddening considering the hotels proximity to a very bad area for crime in Dublin and an halting site next door too!!!   The place was busy but the staff were guilty of leaving plates and food trays in the corridors which look unsightly.  The food was ok but the cleaning was dismal.......There are better hotels to stay in even for a short break to Dublin....,1,2010,08,19
249,Still Itching!,"We visited the Clarion on the 15th and 16th of August and it was well located near the zoo and not far away by bus to the city centre.  The hotel room itself was fine, the towels and duvet covers were clean, but the throws to decorate the bed were seriously in need of a wash (it kind of turns you stomach when the furnishings have dubious stains on them especially when used to cover clean linen.  My biggest let down was the Sano Vitae Health Club - the water was so murky and cloudy I had assumed they had put in a water softener, because there were so many bits floating in it.and my black bathing cap fell off and I couldn't immediately find it (no word of a lie)..my whole body started itching a few hours later despite two showers, I went down the following day to enquire about the hot tub and pool and the nice desk clerk admitted that the pool has ""filtration issues"" and its being looked into.  If that was a filtration issue that pool should have been closed immediately - that is disgusting.  My only other displeasure is that a suburban hotel shouldn't be charging for car parking...I get it in the city, but paying for parking when there is 24 hour free parking across the road at the Shopping Centre is a bit of a joke.

The Hotel was affordable so I'm not fussed about the minor cleanliness, but it was also our summer holiday and next time I will research harder to find a hidden affordable gem rather than an oversized understaffed name brand hotel.",3,2010,08,19
249,Pleasant but could do better,"We stayed on a 2 night DBB basis with 2 young children.  The hotel is perfectly situated for a visit to the zoo (which we had planned to do).  The leisure facilities are great.  We arrived after 4.00 pm to a long queue at check-in to find that there were no rooms ready for us.  We were allowed to use the leisure facilities in the meantime.  I went back to reception after 6pm to yet another long queue to find that the room was barely ready.  When we got to the room the tea/coffee and other items had not been replenished.  We asked the staff in the corridor to do this which they very kindly did.  The meals (which were included in the price) were very nice but a very poor choice and you got exactly the same the next night.  Breakfast was a nightmare!  You had to wait for everything to be replenished constantly from bowls, plates, food items etc.  Overall for the money it was good value but a real shortage of staff.  The staff that were there were very nice given that they seemed under immense pressure all the time as it was a very busy hotel.  The kids clubs unfortunately for us didn't work out as they were not running on the days we were there but to be quite honest having looked at the price list I wouldn't have paid it anyway.  The pool facilities made up for this.",3,2010,08,17
249,Good Family hotel,"Overall this is a fine family hotel for a reasonable price but not without it's problems. The hotel is well located just off the M50 and within walking distance of Liffey Vally Shopping centre. Check-in was busy not only when we checked in but anytime we went through the lobby. With only 2 people checking guests in, it was a slow process.

The room that we had booked was perfectly fine but despite asking for a cot, it was not there on arrival. Not an issue as it was brought down in 2 minutes after we requested it. Room was average size and there was the added bonus of having a fridge in the room as we had a baby with us.

The food in the restaurants (Sinergie & Kudos) was excellent but the service was dreadful. On the Friday night of our stay we went to Sinergie. We had a bit of a wait to order and then again for the food. Despite trying to get the bill, staff didn't seem to want to give it to us. I wanted to accept what seemed a lovely gesture of good will and a free dinner but my wife inssted that we pay.. With the slow service in mind we gave Sinergie a miss on the Saturday in favour of Kudos. With a baby in tow it suited to have bar food to get in and out pretty swiftly... Or so we thought. 25 minutes of waiting was enough to inspire me to ask if we could get some service. Only a short 20 minutes for the starter. Another 30 minutes until the main arrived and then the disappearing act again. we gave up on the dessert idea but did try to pay. The waitress seemed a bit put out by our outrageous request for the bill, I would have thought it was common... 

As I say, the food was great but whether it is down to a lack of staff or overworked staff I'm not sure. To me, those that were working seemed disintersted. Breakfast quality was very good and the hotel are very clear about the busy times. Also, it's a buffet so no long waits for service!

The leisure centre was well laid out and the staff here were really friendly and accomodating and despite the high volume of kids there were still lanes dedicated to swimming.

Outside the hotel entrance there is a taxi rank and rather than tackle Dublin parking, we took a taxi to the zoo (€15). 

Check out of the hotel was another chore but you can check out via your tv in your room. It is a nice hotel with a lot of good points but they are terribly let down by the service of the staff in the restaurants. I would definitely stay here again but I would try out the cafe bar across the road for dinner.",4,2010,08,16
249,needs a bit of work,"Not a bad place. Rooms nice and well equipped. Eating area not really adequate for the numbers accommodated. 15 minute wait in the morning to get a table.  Evening meal quite nice and well presented, but served a bit cold.  Children’s meal was of the same quality as the adults.  

Swimming pool was warm and had a descent sized kid’s swim area.  The main pool is small enough and can get very crowded when full of kids.  The changing area was clean, warm and had plenty of lockers.

Kids play area was pretty poor with old broken equipment and a DVD on loop play.  Most kids only staid 10 minutes and this area really needs some attention if it wants to put its self forward as a ""family establishment"".

Apartments are in a separate complex with rooms facing onto a busy main road. The road noise continues well into the early morning and if you are a light sleeper I strongly recommend ear plugs.

Checking in and out is the biggest chore at this busy hotel with 30 minute waits for both.  You can check out via the TV, but due to a ""stock taking error"" an additional charge was added to our bill.  We were told this error was added to everyone’s bill at the restaurant and wouldn’t be charged.  
Nice enough place spoilt by a few silly mistakes that could be easily rectified.",3,2010,08,15
249,You get what you pay for....,"Checked into the Clarion Liffey Valley, due to its proximity to the airport and pool. First of all, I recieved a room reeking of cigarette smoke (with an asthmatic child) and no air conditioner, and just a floor fan for ventilation.
When asked to change rooms the answer was a resounding ""no..we are full""..The room was filthy, dust on the tables and lamp fixtures, internet wire was pulled out of the wall (no wireless in rooms), the television took 3 tries to get it to stay on, and the shower leaked and flooded the floor.After our first night there (we stayed for 2) our room was never cleaned or towels refreshed despite the sign being on the knob.
The real topping on the cake was the crowds of parents with unruly children bent on destroying all around them, having a laser pointer shone in our window from another room across the courtyard repeatedly...my daughter's eyes hurt for hours. And upon check out we were treated to a full blown bar brawl at the front of the hotel complete with men punching women, hitting the Garda- and the worst language screamed at the top of their lungs...apparently this hotel is used for social events--and many go wrong as this does.
It was sad that on my 10 year old's first trip to Ireland, after 2 weeks, her final memory was one of violence.

I do not reccomend this hotel. Try the Croke Park Hotel, or the Jury's in Dublin. Please do not be swayed by the inexpensive rooms.",2,2010,08,12
249,"Very clean, good location for seeing areas around Dublin","This hotel was very clean.  The location next to a main road meant it was easy to get to places in the countryside outside of Dublin city.  There is also a family gastro pub and a Thai takeaway within spitting distance.  It is also near a huge shopping complex which was handy with a small family.  We stayed in a penthouse which was not as well equipped as it could have been.  It had a lovely kitchen - shame there wasn't a cooker or anything to cook with and despite it being clean, it was clear it had been used for a good few parties in the past.

The staff were friendly and even though the extra bed we ordered wasn't there on arrival it was there within a few minutes of asking for it.",4,2010,08,09
249,Take advantage of the ridiculously cheap meal deal.....,"Rang to ask a few questions in advance and service appeared great and friendly. Was offered a family room with one double and two singles for 89euros (with no food) and for an extra 30 euros was offered full breakfast and evening meals for all of us. 30 euros seemed to good to be true.

On an early arrival on our part we were asked to come back in 30mins, returned 90mins later and still had to wait another 30mins although some free drinks were provided, but the others in the reception didnt get drinks and werent happy.

Room was fine and clean. Swimming pool was good fun for the kids although we all had to wear silly swimming hats (sold for 2euros). Food was 15-25 euros a main meal, so the meal deal was a bargain, food was great although service was just ok.

Free Wifi in lobby and free wired in room. Breakfast was great and plentiful, although very busy after 0830/0900 so get in earliy or you might have a wait.

Car Park was free for 3hrs then 4euros for an overnight. WOuld def recommend and fully recommend the meal deal.... great saving.",5,2010,08,01
249,Lovely comfortable affordable hotel,"Nice clean hotel, had dinner in the restaurant and was really lovely. Staff were lovely and upgraded us to a suite as we had just gotten engaged. Suite was lovely, like a little modern apartment, had balcony and kitchen and was lovely. Just beside liffey valley shopping centre so was very handy.. Had to pay for parkin tho which i thought was a bit mean as free car park across the road..",4,2010,07,31
249,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel!!!!!!!!!,"Myself and my husband decided to hold our daughters holy communion party in the penthouse in The Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley.  Upon arrival there were little candles and tealights lighting everywhere, staff were on hand serving drinks to my family and friends.  The penthouse is absolutely stunning and is just so stylish and contemporary.  The room is huge.... with adjoining bedrooms a gorgeous kitchen area, two bathrooms and a huge relaxation area.  We had a large amount of people, yet no area looked too crowded at any given time.  Tables and chairs were set out on the roof and my friends were so impressed!!!  The food was absolutely gorgeous and the staff could not do enough.  My friends and family still comment on the whole experience and the hotel made our little girl's day very special.  Thanks to everyone involved!   

Our 40th Party
After such an enjoyable experience above, myself and my husband decided to go back to The Clarion Hotel to hold our joint 40th party in The Pegasus Suite.  The staff were again a great help with decorating the room and preparing for the big night...... the food was fantastic, we had a buffet with a variety of foods and it was just gorgeous!  Many of our family and friends stayed over and were delighted with the rooms.  The breakfast is really lovely with any item you could want and the service area is spotless.  I can't say enough about this hotel, it always lives up to our expectations...... don't hesitate to book it!!!",5,2010,07,31
249,Very busy but it was fine for the money,"Stayed one night while visiting friends who live near. It was hugely crowded with people but it was absolutely fine. We had a large room with a double bed and 2 singles ! everything was clean. The breakfast was fine, Nothing really special.",4,2010,07,28
249,Do not enter....,"I Stayed here for 1 night while on a visit to the zoo with my sister and her 2 children aged 6 & 3. When we arrived first impressions of the public areas were bad. They were grubby and untidy. The bedroom was like sleeping in an oven it was so hot.The window only opened a crack and the best reception could do was offer us a fan. Not good enough, should all hotels not have air conditioning. The room was so small to hold the 4 of us. Yes it was clean, but that was about it. Breakfast in the morning was nice. The service was slow and the tables weren't being cleaned as the people were leaving so when we sat down we had to eat from a table surface that hadn't even been wiped clean. It was a monday morning it wasn't very busy and the staff weren't even able to cope with this. Can't understand where this hotel gets its 4* rating.I wouldn't give it a 2. Bottom line, stay elsewhere.",1,2010,07,25
249,A great stay,i  was recently attending a wedding here and thought the service food were fab.  The rooms are a nice size and found the hotel to be really clean.  the rooms were reasonably priced.  Very busy hotel but a good buzz around.,5,2010,07,24
249,Clean and efficient but room next to motorway was very noisy. Failed business hotel now masquerading as a family hotel!!,For business or shopping purposes this hotel is fine however not recommended for a family holiday. This hotel advertises kids club however on arrival we discovered that there was an additional charge for this service. It seems to be operated by a separate company and is open to non resident children. One night was more than enough!!,2,2010,07,21
249,Ideal location and very family friendly,Clarion Liffey Valley is big and spacious. It is just off the M50 motorway and has free parking. It is within walking distance of the very good Liffey Valley shopping centre and multi-screen cinema. The rooms are most comfortable and the lesuire centre is very well equipped. Staff are very helpful.,4,2010,07,13
249,Enjoyable experience,We stayed here on one of the special offers of €70 per night for a family on room only basis and have to say was very pleased with the experience. The check-in was efficient and friendly and the room was spotless. The location is ideal for family day trips and outings as well as shopping nearby.,4,2010,07,12
249,cheap but not 4 star,have stayed here a few times due to good location and good value. Seems to have gone down hill. Fine if your just stopping over to get to airport. We wanted a night away and got great deal 99 euor for a room with breakfast and dinner. Dinner is not in the kudos resturaunt which is in the bar area. Its in the breakfast area  which is realy bright not a tall intimite and feels like a canteen alsowas extremley busy and full of children. Reception we qeued for 20 mins as it was packed. A few parties going on with locals attending and alot of noise. Room was lovlet no air con though only a fan provided and it got extremley warm ordered room service 3 times beofre it arrived. Staff seemed rushed off their feet. Not a great place for a couples night away if you just want a stop over with kids its fine.,3,2010,07,08
249,"Great Room, Great Service and Great Hotel",Room was very clean and I had a great stay!  Friendly staff!,5,2010,07,08
249,unforgettable experience,"Just came back from our first trip to Dublin. The hotel's flybus which stops right outside the door was a great service as you don't have to worry about anything. 
As it was our first trip to Ireland, I asked the staff a lot of questions about ""must-sees"" and they were always helpful and friendly and had some really useful tips for us. Thanks a million again!!
When we were back at the hotel in the evening after a great day in town, we were able to enjoy facilities like the lovely swimming pool and we also loved the food at the bar. 
It was an unforgettable stay and we can't wait to go back as soon as possible =)!",5,2010,07,07
249,Efficient service with friendly staff,"I recently stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend after we had been to a wedding in the  nearby Liffey Valley House hotel. I found the room very spacious, clean and well presented. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and helped us with anything we needed. We found it very useful having the taxi rank just outside the door. Went for a swim before breakfast in the morning too which was really relaxing, a perfect end to our stay there. I would 100% recommend this place!",5,2010,07,07
249,A getaway break,"Had an anniversary weekend here with my partner, we stayed for two days. There is a very modern feel to this hotel, and it is well kept and clean. Good food, relaxing atmosphere. As it located a distance away from the city, it is ideal for a break.",4,2010,07,07
249,terrible experience,"I stayed in the Clarion with my husband,2 teenagers and one smaller child on 3/4th July. We were on the 2nd floor. It was the worst night we ever spent in a hotel. We were awake practically the whole night listening to shouting,screaming,roaring and at one stage a whistle being blown on the corridor outside. It was extremely frightening at times.Obviously there was a group of drunken hooligans staying on that floor. Huge amounts of beer bottles and cans were in evidence outside the rooms next morning When I complained to the receptionist before leaving she offered to get the Manager. She returned without the Manager and instead took my name and phone no for them to contact me.I have stayed there a few times before and recommended it to many people but never again!! The behaviour was bad enough but the shoddy way the complaint was dealt with was worse!!Don't tell me they didn't know they had booked us into a floor with these scumbags! Lots of other families at breakfast next morning seemed happy so obviously were luckier with their rooms.",2,2010,07,05
249,Value for money,"Have reviewed this hotel before and stayed there again recently for 1 night. Had minor issues with unhelpful staff at check-in previously but very nice staff there this time. Asked for room well away from  the bar and high up to avoid noise and was accomodated no problem. Spotless room with free internet.Convenient for airport and liffey valley shopping centre. Must have a car when staying in this hotel as it is 15-20 mins drive from dublin city centre. Used to be free to park but now costs 4 euro/day. Overall for 70 euro room only, it is excellent value but beware of noisy late night revellers particularly when staying on the ground floor.",4,2010,07,01
249,Efficient in the middle of nowhere,"Hotel is located far outside the city. There is a public bus close by - but it takes 30 minutes to downtown. The hotel has a restaurant with very good asian noodles - breakfast is very good. Rooms are spacious, clean and provides free broadband Internet. Bathroom a bit small, but enough. Very friendly staff",3,2010,06,25
249,"Rudest staff I have met in a while, full of loud drunk people","I tried out the Clarion because I was tired of staying in Bewleys when on this side of the city, but while the hotel facilities seemed to be fantastic, the staff and service were the worst I have seen in a long time
The girl at reception made it clear on arrival that she wanted  me out of  her sight once I got my room card, when i asked asked about internet and restaurant she looked like I insulted her and after answering made it clear it was time for me to go.
The bar was full of drunk locals who had to shout above their loud kids which seemed to be everywhere. The bar service and bar staff were even ruder than the receptionist, one shouted at a young foreign couple to wait their turn when asking for a menu, i hope this was not their first night in Ireland.  It took me half an hour to pay  my food as I kept getting the same answer, I didn't serve you, you'll have to find who served you.
overall Bewleys all is forgiven",1,2010,06,23
249,Yet another enjoyable stay,"I revisited the clarion in liffey valley last weekend for the second time. The staff were so friendly and welcoming which is sometimes hard to find during a busy weekend. I love the location, perfect for shopping! We ate in the restaurant on Saturday night and yet again could find no fault. I will definitely go back and will be recommending this hotel to my friends.",4,2010,06,17
249,Disappointing,"Admittedly should have done more research but was looking for something out of town and ""Liffey Valley"" sounded ideal. Little did I know that this was the Liffey Valley retail park and industrial centre situated in the middle of nowhere on the outskirts of nowhere. Hotel used by Nesbits and Chavs for 21st birthday parties, engagements etc. so being woken at 2:30 to 3:30 by gangs of youngsters roaming the corridors shouting and screaming at the top of their voices is obvioulsy the norm. Fire alarm activation and little or no help from the hotel's eastern european staff didn't help our stay and to top it all despite being in the middle of nowhere we were charged 4 Euros a night to park the car!! I don't think we met anybody working at the hoyel that was Irish so there was no charm or personality, very impersonal and uncaring. Won't ever recommend other than to someone I don't like and will never return.",2,2010,06,14
249,Never Again,"We checked into the hotel we were not informed about breakfast , gym etc. The basic that you would expect coming to a so called 4 star hotel. All the receptionist wanted was our money and that was it . Customer Care i dont think so . We paid for an upgrade , well i've never seen such a place . Whhen we checked in we rang down and asked for an ash tray , it arrived 1hr 25mins later . Where to start . The dirt in the sitting room there was still crisps on the floor, loads of chewing gum stuck to the floor , paper under the tv , a keyboad under the made up sofa bed that we didnt want , the room clearly hadnt been hoovered , the kitchenette the tiles had food still on it , the stainless steel under the cupboard had splashes of milk. Behind the microwave flithy. Bathroom horrible the tiles looked like they were never washed , the bath needed to be re sprayed , the shower seemed as if it was going to fall off the wall. Bedroom red wine stains on the carpet , the chairs were manky , the walls and celings had cracks in them , the walls had so many marks of dirt you wouldnt find it in a 2 star hotel . No air con in the rooms and if you dont want to be woken up early make sure your radiator is turned off cause they make some racket.at 7.30am. Breakfast well i wasnt expecting much after the state of the room , sat down ordered coffee ,got some food and 5 tables that came in after us had got tea/coffee before us , asked again and by the time is was brought out we had eaten our food. I was watching people having to clean the seats before they sat down.  We werent the only people who seemed to be having problems with this hotel even a tour group commented on having to wait 2 hours just for a main course and the lady's who were paying for the parking were saying what a joke of a place. We have never been so glad to see the back of a hotel , if you like a clean hotel with  even just a little customer care dont ever stay in this place.",1,2010,05,23
249,Excellent Value Stay!,"Stayed in this lovely hotel on Saturday night in May and thoroughly enjoyed it. We stayed in an apartment wihch was gorgous, seperate bedroom, bathroom and kitchen! The staff were amazing, leisure centre very relaxing and dinner was lovely too, not many choices but food was nice. The hotel is just a 5 min walk away from all the shops also. I would def recommend this hotel and will be back again!",5,2010,05,23
249,great value all round,"i stayed for 2 nite bed & breafast and 1 evening meal, i went with my husband and daughter who is 4 and my parents. Checkin in was fine, the man at reception was very kind and helpful. Breakfast was lovely but get there early as there is a queu but that happens in all hotels. Diner was lovely and i found staff very accomadating to my mother particlar dietary request and nothing was too much trouble for them. I found the staff in the rest of the hotel very nice. Rooms were nice.
i would def stay here again and recomend it to my friends",5,2010,05,22
249,lovely hotel.,"stayed in the clarion with my husband, son , daughter in law, and two grandchildren. the  .hotel was lovely, very cosy, the staff were very friendly and helpful. the hotel was spotless.  the breakfast was  very good value for money plenty to choose from, we would recommend this hotel to anyone, young or old. we will be back again.",5,2010,05,19
249,Good value for money,"Booked a one night stay through lidl-breaks.ie which worked out at total of 98 for 2 people which included breakfast and dinner.

The room was well appointed. The restaraunt was closed so we had dinner in the bar - nobody seemed too sure about what we were entitled to in the bar but it worked out ok in the end.

There are very few or no Irish people working there so if you want to get to meet Irish people pick somewhere else. Those that were working there were efficient but business like. 

All up and considering what we paid this was pretty good value.",3,2010,05,06
249,best stay ever,booked in on sat afternnon very busy but was sorted in no time.staff were friendly and efficient.had two ten year olds with us and the pool was the highlight for them no complats there .the breakfast was excellent value and there was great variety for both adults and kids.ciara was our waitress on both evenings and on our last morning and we found her to be an absolute treasure nothing was too much trouble for her.well done to you all for making our stay so memorable.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.                 PAULINE AND MARY CO.CARLOW,5,2010,05,05
249,Two star experience!,"Stayed there twice over a 2 month period. The second trip was to be a reparative gesture for the first. It failed. 
First some good points. The gym and pool are excellent. The rooms are adequate, internet (Wired in room, wireless in lobby) is free and a few of the staff are pleasant (Thank you Bruno). The beds are comfortable and it does price itself below the competition for the M50 area.
Now some areas that require work, much work! There were problems with housekeeping (Towels missing, no key to the balcony and a safe malfunction), the staff (One nearly burned my arm with a coffee pot starring in the inadequately trained group that comprises the breakfast crew- the sausages were nicely spiced) and some of the lower levels of management (Posturing aggressive behaviour). A staff retrain may be in order. Amazingly they have introduced charges for car parking for a very much out of town hotel. 
Overall, we like relaxing trips away and did not achieve this aim in this hotel. We'll be going back to the Citywest or the Castleknock where for a few Euro more you can have a much better experience.
We will not be staying there again.",2,2010,05,03
249,Great Hotel,"We stayed our first and last nights in Ireland at the Clarion and I still regret not just spending our entire vacation there. Dublin has so much to see and we only got a glimpse do to our tight schedule.  We had already purchased a rental car but had we known that the hotel had a shuttle service to and from the airport we would not have bothered. The hotel is close to a bus stop and it was very easy to navigate the local transit to get to downtown. We were traveling with our children and my in-laws. Our rooms we very nice and clean and the breakfast that was served was a traditional hot Irish breakfast with a side bar of cold meats and cheeses.  Breakfast was WONDERFUL! The staff was very friendly but be aware that some are not all that knowledgable about what is available for children. Before coming I was informed that ""Temple Bar"" was a good place to take the kids for dinner and upon talking to the staff was told it was not ok.  Well, it is a good thing that I did not heed the staff because as long as you go to Temple Bar before 2100 to eat with the kids it is ok. Kids are allowed in the Pubs with their parents to eat and Pub grub is good!  Also, if you eat around 1800 you may get an Early Bird special. All in all I would stay here again but next time it will be fore a longer stay.",4,2010,05,02
249,"Avergae, but acceptable","We read most of the reviews prior to booking and decided on this hotel due to the pool for the kids and proximity to the city of Dublin and roads to get down south. Overall, the hotel was average in regards to overall experience. The facility is a bit due for an update, but the rooms were acceptable in terms of cleanliness. They gave plenty of towels and the shower was clean, and the beds were outfitted with fresh linens and soft pillows. We did not feel that hotel guests should have to pay for parking at the hotel, and there is nowhere else to park or your car will get booted. The hotel is connected to a fitness center and pool and i noticed that the fitness club members who were locals received free parking validation when they used the facilities. We ordered room service once and it never showed so we replaced the order and upon check-out were charged for two complete orders. Luckily to say though that Geoffrey did not question my refute and simply took one meal order off the bill and gave me free parking for the day. The dining experience for breakfast was alright, and unless you are clear they will charge you for both hot and cold breakfast so if you only want one type from their buffet, tell them before you eat. The dining area for dinner in their Asian area was more of a casual bar scene with the no outfitted tables and you have to hunt the waiters down to get menus or have an order taken. However, if you want to have some drinks and listen to their live music then it's perfect and I recommend it. The pool was great and sauna perfect for relaxing after a long tour of the city. Kids pool was great and allowed us to have an outlet for the kids rather than sitting in the room at night or morning. Also, if you want to use their pool remember to bring a swimming hat or they will charge you 3 euros each. They also offer free internet in the lobby, but if you forget your laptop then you can pay to use their computers for 1 euro for 3 minutes. The good things were the fact that the hotel is really close to the biggest shopping center in the area and right on the M-road access to the city with a short 15 minute ride in unless you hit the weekend or rush hour. Overall, we were ok with the hotel based upon cost and would not hesitate staying there again if that's all we could find.",3,2010,04,24
249,Good Hotel - beware of their advertising very misleading!!,"We choose the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley for our Easter break because of the great 'Come and have an Easter breaks with us' advertisement they had on their website this was to include kids club, pool activities, games room and cinema nights for the children. There were no organised kids clubs we were just directed to some separating run business next door which ran kids clubs and had to be paid for.  Swimming pool activities were 2.50 euros per child this was described by the hotel as supervised pool games and inflatables - this was a joke our husbands both went into the pool with the children and came out and said there were no games and one inflatable which would have suited a 3 years old and little supervision.  The games room consisted of 3 board games - twister, chess and connect 4 which were laying all over the place, the staff here should go to the Clarion Hotel Sligo to see what a good games room consists of.  And no surprise the Cinema nights were unsupervised as well.  I should also add that we had also phoned the hotel before booking to just check out the details in relation to Easter and were told 'if the kids are board there would  be something wrong'  the only reason they weren't board was because we went with another family who had kids the same age as ours so they had each others company, it certainly was not down to the so called great activities led on by this hotel.  

The positives about this hotel were that the food was very good the rooms were nice but a little on the small side for a family of 4. Swimming pool, sauna, steam room all good.  Worth a stay but we stayed in the Clarion Hotel Sligo earlier in the year and would have preferred it, much more suitable for children.<(;-;)>",3,2010,04,10
249,If you only need a place to rest your head for a reasonable rate this is for you,"We stayed here for two nights with two toddlers.  We didn't take breakfast as we ate at the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre nearby.  Nicer, livelier and much cheaper.   It's a good hotel if you only need to sleep.  It's true the staff are not so friendly, not even a hello.  However, they are generally not Irish, so I think the Eastern European culture is a little more reserved than the Irish one, and as the staff we met hailed mainly from Eastern Europe, this could explain other posters complaints.  The advantages of the hotel are the proximity to the motorway, and Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.",4,2010,04,06
249,The Rudest Hotel Staff Anywhere,"I stay at this hotel on occasion because a company I work for has a block booking with them. In this current economic climate, with some many Irish hotels going into receivership and administration, I have generally seen an upturn in customer service in many Irish hotels, and my  work has a travel photographer has taken me to many hotels in Ireland, I can assure you.

The Clarion, Liffey Valley, Dublin has - by far - the worst customer service that I have encountered in many years of international travel. Generally, the staff seem disinterested in the guests and one of two have spoken to me as if I was a liar, and someone who should be suspected of a serious crime.

I have been sneered at by a young duty manager and asked for my name three time (on the phone) by a reservations clerk - and when I said ""I've told you twice already"", she replied ""well, there's too much noise here, tell me again"".

The feeling I get when arriving at this hotel now i ""oh no, not here again - I'm dreading even trying to check in without being made to feel inferior and unimportant"".

I implore you - don't stay there. They don't deserve you!",1,2010,03,18
249,Wont be staying again!,"Very poor customer service, waiting two hours for a hairdryer thar was requested five times and given complimenary bottle of wine for the inconvenience which never arrived, adjoining door in room when requested none and had been told previously this was no problem, terrible breakfast dripping in fat, awful hotel DONT STAY THERE!",1,2010,03,09
249,4 star it is not!,"Half the rooms in this hotel back onto a very busy road so they are noisy (kind of like US hotels). So as I was working until 4 in the morning I asked for a quiet one so I could sleep late in the morning. I ended up in a room not on the motor way but it was undergoing construction in the corridor outside my door. So much for common sense, I moved rooms. 
The car park is no longer free here, the breakfast is average but don't go late. It took me 20 mins to check in.",2,2010,02,26
249,Rip Off Ireland is Alive and Well,"I have stayed in most of the Clarion Hotels in Ireland and normally find that they are comfortable, efficient and reasonable good as business hotels. In fact I have previously rated the Clarion Cork as one of my favourite Hotels in Ireland.

This hotel was a disappointment. Poor cleanliness of the bathroom and poor in room services (No Mini bar and no radio channel  on the TV)

However my main gripe (and I don'r often gripe) was when I was presented with a bill for over €13 for a ten minute call from the room telephone to a Dublin mobile number !!!

When I queried this on checkout at noon the next day I was informed that there was no manager available to discuss this with me. I was told that a manager would contact me later if I left my mobile number. I reluctantly paid the extortionate phone bill and I also left my number and email address (they were also on my check in docket) but a few weeks later no one has bothered to call me.

That's why I will not be returning to or reccomending the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley.

Standards are slipping in the Clarion Group!",1,2010,02,10
249,functional but no more than that,depending on ones age this place is ok on the west side of dublin city........close to hueston station and m50 for airport...................but dont expect too much else...............food poor..,2,2010,01,29
249,good value hotel with a very convenient location,Stayed for my first night in dublin. Enjoyed my stay. A friendly receptionist followed by a clean modern  comfortable room. Very content.,4,2010,01,29
249,Not a great location,"I travelled to Dublin for a conference, we stayed at the clarion which is where the conference was held.
I initially asked for another room on arrival as the one I had been allocated smelled very strongly of smoke, as did the entire corridor. The receptionist maintained that it was always a non-smoking hotel but I think she was lying.
I was very happy with the new hotel room. It was clean, spacious and had a really big bed! 
The hotel's dining facilities were nice but nothing amazing. I used the leisure faciliies which were ok too.
The staff were not really very friendly and one was actually quite rude to me. 
The hotel is located close to a retail park and so there is a cinema and a few shops nearby, but Dublin city centre is a good bus/taxi ride away...perhaps upto 50minutes depending on the route and traffic of 17Euros 1 way in a taxi. I extended my business trip so that I could see the sights of Dubin, but in hindsight I should have switched to a city centre hotel once the conference was over so that I could easily get around the city to see more and spend less time sat on the bus!",3,2010,01,16
249,standard hotel - ok for business travelers,"I have stayed here 3 night for business. There is not much around but a shopping center (with a cinema complex) 7 min walk away and a café + restaurant right when you leave the hotel. If you don't have a car you need a cab to get around. 
There is a shuttle service to the airport.

The lobby looks quite ok - so do the rooms - nothing fancy. The carpet of the corridor (on your way to the rooms) is dirty/old and during the afternoon/evening it is filled with trays, used glases and plates where people had ordered room-service. That looks sometimes a bit chaotic and does not create a nice atmoshpere. Anyway - you can get over it. The window in the bedroom was not that good isolated as there was wind coming in when the curtain was not closed.

One of the 3 nights my room has not been cleaned although I left quite early in the morning. It's not that bad - but just a comment.

The fitness-center next door is a nice thing that you can use for free as a hotel guest. It has a lot of cardio equipment, free weights, machines and a great swimming area with pool. This area also has a steam room, jacuzzi and sauna. 

One comment on the breakfast - not that exciting but this could be that the irish kitchen does not over a great selection on ""healthy"" food. The staff in the restaurant is friendly and helpful also the people at the reception. 

There is free internet in the hotel-room with an incredible short cable to connect with your computer. Wireless is only available in the lobby and restaurant area.

Over all it is a hotel to stay in, when you need to be in the area - the price is not that cheap but I don't know if in that area this is standard.",3,2010,01,15
249,Disappointing after 5 years of staying here,On arrival we found that the travel cot which had been pre-ordered for our 9 month old son was not in the room.  After contacting reception it took a further 90 minutes for this to be delivered to the room.  Lighting was awful - too dark.  No plug in bath.  Had to flush toilet on arrival and bin had not been emptied in room.  The Spa reception lost our room key and on the first night of two we were pestered by revellers running up and down corridors banging on doors.  The Spa was full of screaming kids and not relaxing at all.  Also poolside showers were out of order.  Otherwise we had a great time.,3,2010,01,03
249,I stayed here last week and though it was great,I stayed here last week and thought it was great. It was very busy but had a great buzz around the place.  The rooms were quite nice. I didn’t have dinner but had breakfast. It was very busy but had a good selection of hot and cold food.  Overall I thought it was good value for me and would definitely use again.,4,2009,12,06
249,Loved Clarion Liffey Valley,"Stayed here for a friends party & had a fab night, loved the big airy bedrooms, plush carpets, & friendly staff ...had a meal in the retaurant & it was top class! Would & will stay here again no problems, hotels in a great loction too,  loved that I could pop in Liffey Valley sopping centre before heading home! Great room rates too...",5,2009,11,28
249,Fantastic,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here on 21st Nov. Hotel was clean, staff very friendly, 
Upon arrival, the receptionist was very friendly, didnt take her under 5 mins to check us in. Very polite and professional!
Very impressed with bedroom. I personally stay in alot of hotels due to travelling/ holidays, this hotel is 1 of my top 5! 

We benefited from the pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steamroom at no extra cost- bargain!
We had few drinks in bar, got talking to other guests, was great night! 

Next morning we got room service. Food was lovely, loads of it for 2 people! It arrived on time, delivered by a lovely girl, smiling, friendly at that hour of the morning on a sunday!

Overall we were very pleased with it and would go again!!!",4,2009,11,27
249,Top Class From Start to Finish,"I stayed in the Clarion Liffey Valley for my 30th birthday with friends and family. Everything was organised from start to finish by the staff. They organised rooms for all of our guests, the room for our party, food and an excellent bar service. We had a delicisous dinner in the Kudos restaurant. The staff were friendly and very helpful - all of our requests were carried out, and everything was handled efficiently. Location wise it was perfect - I have a large family from all over Dublin and a couple of surrounding counties, so no-one had too far to travel. Everyone complimented me on the night as all had a great time. I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2009,11,25
249,"Rip off with rubbish food and service, = 2 star hotel for a third world country.","Do not eat in restaurant unless you are willing to pay extortionate prices for amateur prepackaged food. No redeeming qualities.Even the simplest of dishes 'Fish and Chips' was inedible,overcooked and oily. Never again!  Restaurant staff are either untrained or remarkably unaware of what customer service consists of.",1,2009,11,22
249,Indifferent Eastern European Staff,"I stayed here for a month for work reasons off and on and with each visit the same issues  kept re -occcuring: Internet cables not working in room, lack of replenishing bathroom materials.  Woeful service in restaurant.

The staff are mostly Eastern European and do not have the slightest interest in customer service, the bar is  a testament to patience, I had to go up and almost pull my own pint, under staffed and indifferent. Go across the road to the Arc restaurant, lovely food and great service, avoid the Clarion for dining.",2,2009,10,30
249,"Quite good, but...","Stayed one week end night in October. I actually liked the hotel but there are a few small things they could improve on. 
We had booked the room online and got a really really good price. We stayed in one of the apartments which was spacious and nicely decorated. Separete bedroom, and ""lounge"" with tv, sofa & armchair, kitchen table & chairs + kitchenette. Some of the chairs were very badly stained. (And of course a bathroom, which was clean btw) 
When we arrived there was a tray outside one of the rooms that we passed. That tray remained there still when we checked out the following morning, despite that a porter dropped towels to our room. Surely that could have been picked up on the way back? Even our son commented on it, wondering why the tray was there ""the whole time""...
Breakfast was nice, nothing to fault. Selection of cereals, bread and croissants & danish pastry, some cold cuts (salami, ham & cheese), fruit, fruit salad and I think there might have been yougurt also. Cooked Breakfast as well. We arrived before the mad Sunday mornign rush so there was no queing. Tea & coffee were quickly delivered to the table.
Went down to the Leiure Centre for a quick swim, pool area is lovely and a good size kiddies pool.
We didn´t dine in the hotel so can´t comment on that. All in all a good hotel and a good stay, would stay again.
€3 parking for every 24 hours. Didn´t bother me. Only stayed one night, can see that if you are staying for longer and bringing our car in and out of the car park it might get quite expensive...",3,2009,10,24
249,Not a 4* star hotel,"Booked room only for 3 people at the Clarion, Liffey Valley for 69euro. Was a good price but all hotels on M50 have similar. Had to pay a 3 euro parking fee which I thought was a bit much.  The bedroom only had towels and tea/coffee for 2 people even though  we had booked the room for 3. I rang reception the next morning to get the extra supplies.  After an hour waiting they brought up only handtowels and no cup! The room was small and a bit shabby and no WiFi.  The corridors and lift areas could have done with a lick of paint. Service in the restaurant was terrible. They forgot our drinks order, forgot sauces when we asked for them twice! and the restaurant was half empty! Would not recommend this hotel, should have stayed in Bewleys!",2,2009,10,16
249,Value Priced Hotel With Average Service,"First  impressions were quite good when we arrived.  Check in was prompt and without any problems.  Myself, my wife and 11 year old checked into a room with double bed and single whiuch was ideal.  The room otself did seam tpo be a bit on the small side but was adequate.  The walls could have done with a lick of fresh paint as it showe its use with dirty smudge marks.  We stayed in the hotel that night and had dinner in their resteraunt.  In fairness we did not have a reservation made but a table was found for us to eat.  The staff were friendly at all times all though it was noticed a number of mistakes made with some of he in experienced waqiting staff.  Now we recieved our food on time and in good condition.  
The on main disapointment that our daughter had was the openingn hours for the swiming pool as we were out all day and the pool then closes at 7pm which we felt was a bit early.
All in all the hotel is ideal for families visiting Dublin for a weekend, however if you are getting away for a romantic weeken then dont come here.",3,2009,10,15
249,good value,"stayed at the clarion liffey valley for one night on Thursday 8th october.Flew Cork to Dublin and got the fly bus direct to hotel for 9 euro. Hotel was clean room was perfect plenty of tea and coffee. my only complaint was that a chair in the room was solied and had coffee stains on it. apart from that it was great.Dont have breakfast there far too expensive go to the Arc Bar round the corner and for 6euro you will get one of the best breakfast in dublin .Dont purchase food in hotel too expensive and not the best im told by the people who work there.

249,absolutely dreadful,"I was hugely disappointed with my stay in the clarion. The ignorant attitude of the staff was unbelievable. Had to ring room service 3 times before it was actually delivered. Rooms were not cleaned on daily basis. Absolutely hated this hotel, they charge guests for parking....thats disgraceful,steer clear of this dump",1,2009,10,09
249,dirty rooms,"The room we where offered was really dirty so went down to reception who gave us another room, this seamed ok until we where getting ready for bed only to find the previous occupants bedding was still on the bed, we had to keep ringing down for tea milk towels, at one point we had to force the glass of the shelves.",1,2009,10,06
249,"nice, but understaffed","We went there for a weekend 2 night break. we were not told that there was an underground carpark, so we parked in the carpark in front of reception,which is behind barriers and has security cameras, but still my car was broken into the first night. the hotel charge to park, but accept no responsibility for theft or damage?.The first mornings breakfast was like a scene from Faulty Towers, as they were so understaffed, we cleaned our own table,had buffet breakfast,asked for coffee, then for cups,then for spoons, with one poor girl trying to serve all. The following morning was quite the opposite, very efficient. The hotel is nice, well located and clean...",3,2009,10,05
249,Value priced hotel with great pool and gym,"This hotel is located in Liffey Valley, about 6 miles west of city center Dublin. There is a large mall nearby within 15 minutes walking distance and bus transportation to city center.  Having your own car is more convenient and fortunately there is ample outdoor and underground parking at reasonable price.  
The multinational staff was courteous and helpful although there was a long line at check-in.  This hotel does a lot of parties, weddings and catered events especially on weekends so can get crowded and noisy then.  For example, there were long lines for breakfast in the mornings on the weekends.  Breakfast is buffet style either continental or full Irish.  The quality of the food could have been better.  
The first room we had was of good size and comfortable but it was very warm during the night and the window only opened a crack.  The front desk offered to change our room to one with balcony which we could open.  The second room was also of good size.  
The best part of the hotel is its pool and gym facility which is free for guests.  The pool is particularly wonderful with warm water, perfect for doing laps.  They also have a sauna and whirlpool.  Changing rooms were large and clean.  
This hotel offers great value for Dublin.",4,2009,09,18
249,OK,On arrival hotel look good. Found the receptionist to be very ignorant and not very friendly. Good value for money in bar food. Rooms are nice and comfortable. Restaurant not very big as we had to queue for breakfast along with other guests. Breakfast was lovely. Only problem was the waitress served the tea and coffee by the cup rather than by the pot. If your like me that needs more than one coffee in the morning this does not suit. Found pool to be very packed with a lot of kids on the first evening. Pool very cold first thing in the morning. Don't go during school holidays.,3,2009,09,08
249,"An inconvenient location, where you are treated as one of the masses","Although the room was perfectly good, the service here is appalling;  we waited endlessly to check in, we had to ask FOUR TIMES at breakfast for coffee/tea, which eventually arrived long after we had finished eating, and then when we tried to phone from the airport as we had forgotten something at the hotel, they simply never answered their phones.  I would recommend staying anywhere in Dublin BUT the Clarion Liffey.  Also received completely incorrect instructions from hotel staff re: transport into Dublin, and ended taking a taxi each time (around £20 each way), which amounted to a small fortune.",1,2009,09,02
249,Average Hotel. Too big and not too many happy customers.....,Stayed with my wife and kids for two nights. Got a cheap deal and wanred a hotel with a swimming pool and outside the city centre. Next to a big shopping centre. We were out of the hotel a lot visitng friends and going to the zoo. Whenever we passed reception there was a long Que. People always seemed to be coplaining about their rooms or mix up in bookings. We got up early for breakfast and in fairness it was OK. There is a notice in the bedroom that warned about peak times for the breakfast form 9.15 to 10.15. We arrived at 9 and did not have to wait. When we left at 9.30 the Que was about 40 people. At night there were as many kids as adults in the bar at 11 p.m........... I would consider the hotel an OK 3 star for Irish people up for a weekend in the city shopping or for a match. If you were on holiday from abroad I don't think you would like it.,3,2009,08,24
249,great stay,"we have just got home from our weekend away with our 3 kids(one 16) . I booked 2 nights through the hotel after seening the offer on the internet, we booked a triple room for the kids at 69 euro a night and a seperate double room with a living/kitchen area. All together it cost 356 euro. and our room came with robes,slippers and snack bag( half bottle of wine,pringles,bar and apple) were ment to get free papers but didnt get any...all this was included in our offer. Rooms were nextdoor to each other so we had no worries. (there was also a connecting door we could have had opened but our kids liked the independence)
We had breakfast in the hotel on first morning. 12.95 for adults for full irish and 9.95 without full irish, 5euro for kids. our breakfast cost nearly 50 euro for 3 adults 2 kids!!!! and kids just had a crossant ( they just wanted that). kids loved the pool. hotel is very clean and staff were lovely. rooms are spacious and well kept.
on the second morning we had breakfast in the kylemore in the liffey valley shopping centre which is just beside the hotel and it cost 26 euro!! full irish for 3 and crossants and toast for the kids. overall fab hotel, will defo go back and would defo recomend it.",5,2009,08,23
249,"It was a comfortable hotel, but a bit too far from the City Centre.","We ended up at the hotel because everything else was book up for the big U2 concert weekend.  It was reasonably priced, but I have to admit that I thought it was a different Clarion Hotel closer to the city centre. There is a shuttle to/from the airport for €9 per person.

Overall our stay was nice.  Our room was always cleaned and they didn't charge us for any extras.  I enjoyed the free internet access, which made it easy to update friends/family on our trip. The pool and spa were nice and there's a sauna and steam room there too. The food was good, but pricey, so we only had meals there twice.  It's a short walk to the LiffyValley Centre (mall) and that's where the bus (78A) is. The ride into the city is long, but we used that time to decide on where we would be sightseeing that day. We purchased 5 day passes for € 20 (each) at the airport and that got us on/off any bus all over the city for a week.

A bit of a trek, but economical.",4,2009,08,21
249,Value for Money,"I stayed in the Clarion for 2 nights with my twin girls (nearly 7). I have just been reading some of the one star reviews and while I agree with some of what has been said, I give the hotel a 4 star because of the staff efficiency. I booked this hotel at the last minute the night before through Expedia. I paid 134 euro for 2 nights in a family room, no breakfast, which I think was good value. I was torn between staying in the city centre in Cassidy's with the Supervalu 2 night offer but there was no pool and I kind of wanted somewhere with a pool. The Maldron in city was another option but from the reviews, it appeared to be 30mins walk from city centre. We arrived at 11.15am by train from Killarney. We got a taxi there (approx 15 euro) and luckily we got a famliy room straight away on the ground floor (no. 215) so we were able to drop our bags and go to the zoo without worrying about luggage. Unfortunately, this room was too warm even though the radiator was turned off. We requested a fan which we received promptly but it went beserk if turned to higher than the no. 1 setting so there was no hope of having it on during the night even at the lowest setting (way too noisy). My girls usually sleep through the night no problem but I always have problems sleeping away from home so it was a bad sign when they were wide awake at 3.30m. I allowed them turn on the telly (nothing on) and they eventually fell asleep again. It was a combination of the heat and the busy motorway (very near the roundabout) outside that kept us all awake so I requested a change of room the next morning. On the plus side, yes, the mini-bar is empty but I used it to store snacks - fruit, yogurt and bottle of wine. Again, I agree that there were only glasses/mugs/towels for 2 people provided despite the room sleeping 3 people but my request for an extra mug was dealt with straight away. The nearest grocery shop (Marks & Spencers) is in the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre so we stocked up there on food items as we weren't having breakfast in the hotel. I requested 3 bowls and a knife which again, were provided very quickly, and this allowed us have some cereal and fruit in the morning. I requested a room change after the first night (anything not facing the motorway) and were moved to room 542 on the 3rd floor. Straight away, I could tell the difference in the room temperature and needless to say, the girls had a great night's sleep. I slept very well also' considering my sleeping habits while on holidays. We visited the swimming pool on our 2nd day. They were running a 2pm-5pm fun time with inflatables where you could leave the kids if you wished. I stayed around at the side of pool as I wasn't up for much anyway. The depth is 1.4m all over (there is a very shallow kids' pool). My girls are quite tall and are moderately good at swimming. Unfortunately, I left the arm bands at home as they don't normally need them but as the pool was so deep (about 4'6"") I felt they needed armbands. There was only one spare pair in the pool reception so I had to buy another pair for 12euro. So bring the arm bands if you have any doubts at all 'cos you'll pay well for them if you don't. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant. There are a few restaurants in the shopping centre. The Ranch/Steakhouse place offers kids free to 5pm (conditions apply probably) and they have a little play area off the restaurant. The waitress also brought crayons and colouring paper to the table to entertain them while we waited. There a few other places to eat in the shopping centre. The cinema is quite impressive and movies start early in the morning. We went to see Bandslam at 10.30am!!! We never located the bus stop there but from what I can make out, you have to cross the large footbridge which you will see if you come out of Marks & Spencers (near the tills of the grocery section). There is 2 other restaurants a stone's throw from the hotel and an off licence. We ate in The Arc the 2nd night and like many other places, they offer a child's meal free with each adult but it's the standard children's meal (pizza/sausages/nuggets with chips). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Clarion. Having visited the city on my last day, I'm a little sorry that I didn't book into Cassidy's in the end- The Clarion was lovely but from seeing the city before we took our train, we would have saved money on taxis and would have had more choice in restaurants and shops in the city.",4,2009,08,21
249,Great Apartments,"We stayed in a two bed apartment for three nights and it was lovely.  The apartment was very spacious and well laid out.  If you have a family I would recomend you use them rather than the family room as there is a lot more space.  The apratment includes a kitchen with a microwave, dishwasher and full size fridge, it also included a washer drier.
The staff were great and friendly escecially Yoyo on reception who greated us with her friendly smile.
The hotel itself was very busy and we had to queue  for breakfast, but with a little patience we were soon seated.  The breakfast was of a good standard but the staff didn't get time to clean up properly as they were so busy.
All in all The Clarion Liffey Valley is a good all round hotel in a great area for shopping and I would use it again.",4,2009,08,21
249,not even a one star,booked 5 night family break upgraded to an executive twin room. the room smelled and was dirty and very worn the luxry items were dove soap and army toilet paper (TWO HALF ROLLS). ASKED FOR ANOTHER ROOM IT WAS JUST AS DIRTY AND WORN. DID NOT SMELL BUT THE DOORS WERE HANGING OFF THE WARDROBE. DIRTY GLASS ON THE BALCONY. TRIED A 3rd room and finally gave in and left the throw on the main bed was covered in some form of human stains. i have never beeb so disappointed with a hotel. the first thing we did when we left was wash our hands.,1,2009,08,16
249,Avoid at all costs,"This ranks as the worst hotel I have stayed in Europe. I booked it for location (family of four). First impression of the family room was the musty smell. The lobby,bar & restaurant were full of rampaging kids and one of the hit high pitch on the screaming richter scale. The hotel was filty on the inside. That night there was a function and we were woken up by singing in the car park - just when you get back all the buses ramp up.Breakfast was a joke with the queues and even though there were plenty of empty tables, staff insisted on putting you through a waiting routine. They had one poor girl to clear all the tables and bring tea/coffee. Surprised to see it has the ""Clarion"" franchise - only redeeming feature is location for going North/South,IKEA or to airport. Other than that it will be a cold day in hell before I return. For good measure they charge you €3 for parking.",1,2009,08,13
249,nice hotel-tyrone traveller,"we stayed in this hotel with our 4 yr old son.rooms are lovely,95% of staff seem nice..pool  gym etc is great....dont like the bar layout however,just me..bring your own drink..too dear..not hotel problem though...just dublin.love the breakfast.eat as much as you want...has everything...we stayed with a vivo offer of 3 nights b+b and 1 evening meal...meal for the offer is terrible....no good choice on menu...everyone else eating lovely starters while we eat a tomato.......i think all these offers are useless as far as the evening meal goes...bus to centre takes 45 mins...bus stop 5 min walk,,,,quiet relaxing hotel....8 min walk from liffey valley shopping centre...overall good hotel...too far from city centre though if you want to party...",4,2009,08,11
249,Lovely Hotel with bad staff,Where do I start? This was our second  stay in this hotel and in 2 years the service has deteriorated badly. We stayed there in February before so maybe the staff just can't cope with the busy summer months. We have 3 young children so had upgraded to a one bed apartment which was a king size bed in one room and a sofa bed in the living area ( both extremely uncomfortable) but I forgot to request a quiet room so we ended up with an apartment facing onto a very busy motorway so the first night got very little sleep as the children could not sleep. We asked to be moved the following day which the receptionist was happy to do and she admitted that those rooms can be very noisy so as to why they would put a family with 3 young children in there in the first place is beyond me.. We moved to the other apartment that evening and when we had finished we discovered that there was no air conditioning in the room and it took 4 calls to reception over the next night and the following morning to receive a reply which was that the air conditioning was broken with a while and would not be fixed during our stay. The apartment was very warm so she offered us another apartment or fans and as we had moved already we took the fans which she said would send immediately. We came back that evening and the fans were not there so had to ring reception twice more to get them. Also in regards the parking - We were told to park in the underground car park and every time we wanted to get out we had to come to reception to get the ticket validated which took ages each time as obviously people were checking in/out etc and we were still charged €3 a day for parking anyway. All the staff were foreign as well - we didn't come across one Irish person working there. The only thing going for this hotel really is its location as its just off the M50 and the liffey valley shopping centre is literally 2 mins away. It is very clean though and we had no problem getting extra towels etc and the buffet breakfast was very good even though we had to queue the 1st morning. It's just the service is crap basically....,3,2009,08,09
249,Never Again,"I stayed in Clarion Liffey Valley and altough it is a lovely hotel with lovely rooms it is the worst service that we have recieved anywhere we have ever stayed. There is no consideration giving to families with young children from the long waits to checkin , checkout and even queue for breakfast. The pool is un supervised with older kids jumping from the small toddler pool into the main pool and in general not suitable for anyone with smaller children.

The staff in general dont seem to want to be doing the job there doing and didnt especially at breakffast where request for Tea went unanswered. 

if your staying oder room service and in geneal keep your expectations low.

To beat it all , we were then charged nightly for parking for the whole duration which i didnt relaise until  we had left altough we had to pay each day to take the car out.

All in all , avoid.",1,2009,08,02
249,Lovely hotel,"Real nice hotel with nice staff. Breakfast and dinner excellent.
Rooms well appointed and lovely pool and fitness centre.
Only downfall is the traffic going out that direction from the city centre, if you hit rush hour it can take well over an hour. The bus stops are a long walk from hotel.
There is an eccellent shopping centre about a 10 minute walk from hotel.
Would go back again but would arrange to travel to and from hotel at times that would not clash with rush hour traffic.",4,2009,07,31
249,good hotel,"this is a nice hotel,very comfortable,clean and modern. this hotel is far away from dublin city centre ,the bus stop from this hotel is quite a walk if you are using public transport,but the busses are very frequent. the carpet was badly stained leading up to the rooms,iwould say it is a 3 star not 4,overall a nice hotel.",3,2009,07,29
249,very disappointing for a 4* hotel,"booked 4 nights in Dublin as a birthday treat, stayed 2 nights in a 3* hotel so decided on this hotel for the last two nights. Really wish we had stayed at the 1st hotel. The staff treated us like we were part of a cattle market. The 1st room we were given had white stains all over the pillows & I wouldn't even guess at what the stains on the walls were. When I complained we were fobbed off until I asked to speak to the manager, the 2nd room had the same stains on pillow cases & also on the chairs, the sink was blocked in the bathroom & the cleanliness was substandard. We ended up having to speak to the manager but this was after a lot of rudeness from the reception staff.  We were turned away from the bar because they had a wedding reception & the they had run out of most of the breakfast.         Would not stay here again even if it was free!",2,2009,07,19
249,Very Dissapponting,"My husband is currently staying in this hotel.  As a business traveller he has stayed in a number of hotels and cannot believe that this is a 4*. The staff have been very rude and unhelpful.  He tried to dine in the Sinergie Restaurant this evening and was turned away as they apparently were fully booked (not one guest in the restaurant) and he had not made a reservation. He was NEVER advised (even after discussing the restaurant with reception last night) that he needed to make a reservation. As he is working all over Ireland it is impossible to make a reservation for a specific time. He was told to ""go to Kudos ""which he did on the first night however their menu is fairly limited and not the type of food he would eat. Breakfast also leaves a lot to be desired. Room is nice enough however will definately NOT be using this hotel in the future.",2,2009,07,14
249,GREAT STAY,"i was recommended  this hotel by a friend, and was not dissapointed the room was modern and stylish, big comfortable double bed and also included free internet access, bathroom was large with shower and bath which was great, rooms are quite and relaxed, reception team where friendly on arrival,  price's vary per room eg suit's and that but good all round rate's, not a great selection of food from the evening room service menu, so we decided to go out to eat.  there is a car park but you have to pay €3 approx for the day,  the hotel has a large bar, bit of a cold feeling, it was rather busy that night for a tuesday and took half hour to order 2 drinks! as there wasnt enought bar staff on. The  breakfast was inc in our rate, we decided to get room service  the next morning there was a large selection from this menu, the porter which brought our breakfast was rather rude i tryed to explain that we already paid for breakfast and left a 100 deposit at reception for extra's to the room., , but she just rolled her eyes and walked out of the room!,  and charged the breakfast anyways, which had to be amended by reception on departure.  a little off putting... but we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2009,07,13
249,Disappointing for a 4* Hotel,"Arrived on Friday 10th July to spend a nice weekend with my daughter.  My first impressions were that it was well situated and ideal for shopping  at the local Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.  However when I entered the reception area I was greeted with the bad odour of dirty nappies.

The reception area is lovely and bright but unfortunately the staff were not what I would call friendly.  They gave the impression that they were there to do a job nothing more.  A smile and greeting wouldn't go astray.

The room was lovely; not ideally situated since I requested a quite part of the hotel.  We were on the ground floor to the front which meant we heard every person who passed by our window and every vehicle that stopped at the entrance.  The noise during the early hours was a nightmare.  I was totally stressed out by morning having  had no sleep.

The breakfast was the most disappointing.  Even though the restaurant was lovely and bright the manner in which the breakfast was laid out was not suitable.  All the hot food was pre-cooked and covered but only warm not hot;  tons of toast was prepared but was cold under the light.  The large pot of tomatoe sauce filled to the brim was off putting at the end of the hot food area.  The cereals were limited with no spoon available for the sugar;  the large glass pots of marmalade and jam were also disgusting and cheap looking.  

I don't expect much but certainly would expect a lot more from a 4* hotel.  Wouldn't stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.   The parking was good value at €3 a day.",3,2009,07,13
249,relaxed time,"we arrived and staff were extremely helpful and polite ! we went to the leisure centre which we all enjoyed ,we found the centre was of high standard although the pool a little cold to what we would be used too .The staff were friendly and rooms were clean and had all the facilities (iron ,tea ,coffee hairdryer ) that some hotels lack .Cannot fault this hotel and will definently return ...great location !!",4,2009,07,11
249,Lived Up To Expectations,"We stayed in this hotel for a week as we were in Ireland for a district convention of three days.  The hotel had been recommended to us as suitable for use as a base as we wanted to get to Dublin for a few days.
We arrived late on Monday night, having taken the Flybus from the airport right to the hotel door which was very convenient. The staff in reception were very nice and efficient and were given a room on the ground floor.  
Very ample and clean room with a separate table and chairs which we used several mornings to have breakfast as we thought 20 euros per person for breakfast expensive.  The shopping centre is only 7 mins walk away so we bought some food in.  

On arrival the safe in our room was not working and although the concierge did his best to fix it, we had to wait till the morning to get it fixed, which was reasonable.  The following morning the maintenance man arrived and promptly fixed it before we went out for the day.  The reception was concerned that it should be done right away for our security.  There was free internet in our room and tea and coffee making facilities with biscuits which was replenished every morning.  One evening my wife went to the restaurnant for extra milk and tea bags and they were very willing to help.  Comfortable bed and towels replaced regularly.
 Throughout our stay all the staff were very helpful, helping us with maps and Kris the concierge went out of his way to advise us.  He helped us by printing a flight change confirmation which I had made on my laptop.  
We made use of the restaurant a few evenings which was quite good and very reasonable.  There is a separate restaurant not connected to the hotel just opposite  and a cafe for breakfast which we used a couple of times and was very good.

The hotel is well located for the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and the bus to the centre of Dublin leaves from there and costs 2.20 euros one way, number 78A right to the centre.  There is plenty of parking at the hotel, the first 3 hours is free, 3.00 euros for each 24 hours thereafter which we found reasonable.

All in all, value for money we thought at 65 euros per night for the room.  Would stay there again.",4,2009,07,03
249,like opening a bright present and getting a bananna,"hi my name is paudie.i have a 1 year old and a nine year old,and we came up on the train from kerry,it was tough traveling with a one year old.we went up with my brother in law and his wife and his little girl.its my first time staying in a hotel so we chose the clarion.it is my first experience of a hotel having never stayed in a hotel before,first impressions were,excitment when we booked in,but then when we hit floor 3,which was the floor we were staying on,it reminded me of an apartment in edward court in tralee.oh my god,the walls were dirty along foot level,and so was the carpet coming out of the lift.4 star hotel mee hole..maybe i expected too much.on the first night we ordered or meal,it took a while....so i ordered a drink,so i got a pint of bud, nice pint of bud..but when i was at the bar i offered my girlfriend a glass of wine, but she was minding the young one so she said she ll have a half pint of bud, so i ordered,and he gave me a pint, and i said ""sorry it was a half a pint,"" so he pulled out a half pint glass and before my eyes filled the half pint glass up wth the contents of the pint glass,oh my god i was stunned..i knew it wasnt right but i walked away anyways,i went down and told my brother in law,and he said,""oh my god,never seen the likes of it""but we talked about the consequnces of complaining,but we were ordering food,and i was afraid they would spit into it...maybe i was wrong.maybe they were overworked but underpaid,thats all i got to say.but the rooms were lovely,chow.",3,2009,07,02

249,Good for shoppers and location not for relaxing weekend,"Stayed here with my hubby recently have to say nice clean hotel with fantastic location for shopping. For night life its way toom far out from city centre. On arrival reception staff friendly and helpful. had prob with our tv and this was fixed within ten mins off calling about it.Car parking is now chargedt for here which is a disgrace.When checked into room all we could hear was someone shouting in the gym obviously fitness instructor and this lasted for 2hours not  very relaxing!
No movies on demand unless you like adult movies! 
Overall a nice clean hotel but not up to usual Clarion Standards.
More a good 3 star than a 4",3,2009,06,23
249,Not bad but not great,We stayed in this hotel for a weekend. I pesonally thought the hotel was ok. You may be waiting a while at reception. The rooms are nice and clean. We had a package which included a meal one if the nights. The portions were tiny. The service was ok.  Location is good for the liffey valley shopping which is just accross the road also the zoo is ten mins down the road.,3,2009,05,22
249,Nice hotel and good value,"We have stayed at this hotel several times and overall really enjoyed our visits.  We stayed in an executive room and also one of the apartments.  The rooms and apartment were clean and spacious.  The check inn staff were very friendly and efficient. Breakfast and dinner from room service were very good and fast.  We tried the restaurant for dinner one night and the food was okay but the service was very slow,  The pool was great and the changing rooms were clean.  The location is good if you have access to a car which we did,.  There were a few things which we noticed on each of our visits which shoud be corrected - room services dishes outside of rooms for long perids of time(over 24 hours) as well as laundry bags left outside of rooms.  Overall though we would stay there again.  It is handy as there is a shopping mall within walking distance which has a food court and restaurants.",4,2009,05,17

249,Great Stay!!!,"Myself and my partner stayed in this hotel over the Easter week. From the moment we entered the reception we were greeted with a pleasant smile and a welcoming atmosphere.  It is hard to believe some of the previous reviews are of the same hotel. The hotel was busy for the week but the staff were stall able to go out of there way to be helpful. We encountered Jo at reception and found her very friendly and helpful. We used the majority of the facilities and thoroughly enjoyed the leisure centre, which seemed to be busy but thankfully Niamh on reception was able to tip us off on the quiet times to come down. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and am looking forward to returning already, would recommend this hotel for both families and couple’s looking for a break.",4,2009,04,23
249,Were we staying in the same hotel???,"My family (wife child 20 mths and I) just last Easter weekend stayed here,arriving on Sat at 2:30,check-in took 2 mins max. and were given a room on the 1st floor.(cost 130 room only for Sat and Sunday nights!!!!)The room was absolutely massive which was ideal to fit the travel cot,slippers and robes supplied,proper ironing board and iron(believe me,v.rare!!Stayed in Jurys Inn in Newcastle in England 1 mth ago,1 travel iron for the WHOLE HOTEL!!!)even the hairdryer was wife approved!!!Hotel was 5 mins walk max from Liffey Valley Shopping centre.Decided not to eat in Restaurant until Sunday night,ordered take-out from Lemongrass restaurant across the road,food amazing!! Arc bar is across the road as well(Off Licence open til 10).Slept like a log on a massive bed!Took off to Dublin Zoo on the Sunday & afterwards went to pool with the child,big childrens pool,main pool is 20mtrs long with about 6 lanes.Went to Sinergie Restaurant on Sunday Night,1 of the nicest steaks ever!!Staff were v. friendly,my wife was worried after reading all the bad/not good reviews on this site......Were we staying in the same hotel as other reviewers????",5,2009,04,15
249,In No way a four star hotel!,"We stayed here for a weekend away, and from the word go it was only ever ok, definetely no where near a four star hotel. We had a couple fighting on the corridor all night and even though we called security twice not much changed so we didnt get any sleep at all the first nite.  The breakfast was good enough but we had to chase staff to get utensils and tea and when we did they were not very happy about it.  We also had an evening meal here as it was part of the package this was very poor the dinning room really wasnt cleaned at all from the morning and the more i looked round the more disgusted i got it really wasnt clean at all, the food for dinner wasnt good either and the staff just stood round laughin and chattin not wanting to catch your eye in case you needed anything.  Well what more can i say except i wont be going back , makes you wonder in times of a recession youd think they would look after their guest and really get the basics right like food and basic cleanliness.",2,2009,04,12
249,"You're kidding, right?","It's hard to believe this hotel is getting a majority of good reviews.  We booked a five-night stay there in March-April 2009 and I will tell you what we found.

First, let me state I've stayed at many types of hotels all over the world and, really, all I expect is to get is what I pay for.  If I pay for a budget hotel, I hope it will be clean!  If I pay for four stars, I kind of expect four stars.  This is NOT a four-star hotel.  Maybe not even three.

This was our first trip to Dublin so I emailed - twice - and asked the best way to get to the hotel from the airport.  Received no response.  Should have been a clue.  On arrival, it took approximately 1/2 an hour to check into the hotel.  We were told that we would be able to enter and and exit the parking lot 'as much as we liked' - I was asked to pay for parking on the second day.  

This hotel is reaching the end of it's life and is pretty shabby.  That's ok if it's at least clean and shows signs of regular maintenance.  The staff doesn't seem to clean the hotel - items like discarded pencils, vases, room service trays and linens were in the halls for days on end without being picked up; the conclusion would be that the hallways were not vacuumed.  On laying on my bed the first night, I noticed the floor looked rather dirty.  I accidentally dropped a potato chip the following evening and decided to let it lay to see if it got cleaned up.  It did not (yes, I picked it up the next evening!).  I don't believe our room was vacuumed for the duration of our visit.  

One of the two elevators that serves the wing we were in was out of service the three days we were there.

We booked a triple and needed to ask for extra cups and towels.  These were provided the first evening and then not refreshed the following day.  We asked for another set of cups and towels again.  These were then not refreshed the following day.  The coffee and tea in our tea service was not replaced once we used it.

These are all relatively minor service complaints, I would have tolerated them in a lower rated property.  If it were not for the final problem.  In order to reach our room, one needed to go right down a long main hallway, right again to the elevator and then left down a long hall to our room.  That's not the problem.  Along the very first hallway that all the traffic to the rest of the hotel must traverse was a HORRIBLE smell.  I've worked in hospitals and animal labs and I can only describe it as something dead or raw sewage.  This smell existed for the entire three days we were there and extended for a distance of approximately five rooms along the hallway.  It was so disgusting there was no way you could have paid me to eat in their restaurant and was finally was led to us moving out two nights short of our booked five-night stay.

In the hotel's defense, they quickly refund our prebooked and paid for nights and seemed to want to try to make it good but I was still concerned about what died in the hallway and we left and found a very nice restored Georgian in Dublin for the same price.",1,2009,04,07
249,Not service with a smile!,"Stayed here for 1 nite with husband as a competition prize.  After receiving all the literature about the penthouse, we were really excited to be staying in something other than your run-of -the mill hotel bedroom.  The penthouse itself has a view overlooking waste ground and a busy motorway with a small balcony (which we could not open).  The living room was comfortable but certainly not plush and there were no bathrobes, hairdryer or iron anywhere.  Phoned reception to ask for hairdryer but no-one arrived with one and had to have breakfast with wet hair.  We had to have a meal in the bar as the restaurant was closed for some reason even though it was a sunday and the place was busy. Staff in the bar area were unbelievably depressed looking and only cheered up when they presented you with the bill (obviously trying for a tip).  A glass of wine is 6 euro and a beer 5 euro.  There is an off licence and a thai restaurant a short walk away so we bought a bottle of wine and had it in the suite.  Not worth a fraction of the 500 euro it costs a nite to stay in the penthouse! Would not go back.  There is parking rite outside the door but make sure u get yr ticket stamped when u are checking out so u do not have to pay as guests are free.",3,2009,04,01
249,Never again,"This was the second time I stayed at this hotel and although I wasn't very impressed the first time (the non-smoking room stank of smoke) I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and try it again. First of all, the service was terrible- 20 minutes waiting to check in and it wasn't even busy. Second of all, the hot water in the shower kept on going cold and then scalding hot. The hotel itself was very noisy and children were let run down the corridors until the early hours of the morning but what really did annoy us was that you had to pay for parking on top of your room rate which is ridiculous. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2009,03,30
249,very modren and good service,iv been here many time with my boyfriend loved the rooms very spacious and they always have an upgrade offer for an extra 30 euros or so you can upgrade to an appartment which dose better for familys and they are top of the range to the breakfast can be expensive if its not part of the deal you booked but the arc cafe bar is accros the road which has breakfast specials the arc also has a great nightlife turns into disco bar on the upper level after nine and its also nice for food they do bar food and a carvery thy also have lemon grass retarant there the gym and pool in this hotel is tope quality to,5,2009,03,10
249,great hotel for a break away,"after reading all the bad reviews I initially regretted booking this hotel - but I didnt need to worry as this hotel was lovely - friendly staff, huge rooms and super bar food.... all in all a great stay!!",4,2009,02,16
249,Lovely Hotel,"Hotel & Staff: I stayed in this hotel in June 2008 during the bank holiday weekend. The hotel is very nice and the staff were extremely helpful, even though there was a mistake with the number of people supposed to be staying in our room but they sorted it out straight away and gave us an even better room than we should have been given.  On departure they arranged for us to stay in our room after check-out, as our flight wasn't until that evening, and taxis to pick us up to bring us to the airport!

Facilities: The leisure centre was very relaxing.  The pool was heated and had a jacuzzi, steam room & sauna nearby!  

Food: We didn't try the restaurant so I can't comment on the food but I do believe the breakfast buffet was expensive enough, maybe around €18...I know you can eat all you want but how many people would eat €18 worth of food?!

Price: I can't remember exactly how much we paid for the rooms but I can assure you it was very reasonable especially for the quality of the hotel.  We booked it through roomex.com!

Location: It was good bit out from the city but there is a big shopping centre(Liffey Valley Shopping Centre) about a ten minute walk away from the hotel!",4,2009,02,03
249,Absolutley horrific stay!!!,"I booked this hotel for my partners birthday and just a romantic getaway. We have a young baby who we got minded for the weekend and we looked forward to a relaxing break! Our break however was far from relaxing...On arrival we were asked to put our bank cards pin no in to allow the hotel to freeze 350 Euro from our account for deposit reasons, basically incase we may run up bills to our room. However this was alot of money considering our room for two nights only came to 135 Euro. When I asked to simply pay for our two nights accomodation the reception assured me this was fine and the money in my account would be unfrozen as this was the only card we had with us.
The money was not unfrozen, we found out the following evening when our card was declined upon trying to purchase petrol to travel.I was extremley embarassed and called my bank.My bank thankfully sorted the problem for me and I was finally able to access my account the night before leaving for home!!
Not ideal at all, aswell as this staff were unfriendly, unhelpful and usually foreign, not really understanding us most of the time.
Room service trays always in halls even in evening and overnight, reception did not answer the phone on occasion.empty mini fridge.very basic rooms although we stayed in executive suite.
Ontop of all this I arranged before our arrival for bottle of wine and fruit basket to be in room, there was nothing not even a bottle of water!
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and my partner and I are extremly angry with how we were treated and would never return!!!!!!!!!",1,2009,01,18
249,never again,"stayed here for two nights the room was nice.Checkin was long my card was swiped as a security measure (fine until later)no debits would be taken until i authorised it.first morning phone rang at 7.30am not exactly a lie on no one on the other end.restaurant was just chaos plenty of staff but none of them had a clue what they were doing,i saw at least one couple get up and leave after waiting about an hour for starters.Went to the bar on the first night staff just ignored us so we left and went to the off license next door.second morning i had pulled the phone out just in case !!guess what there is two phones in the room and it rang at7.30 am again, phoned reception to complain  the reply was ""THE TRUTH""i then got back in to bed for the phone to start ringing again when i phoned reception again i was asked did  you not order a wake up call.when i said i did not they said are you sure.When i was checking out i asked why i was awakened  so early they checked and it was the previous guest that ordered a wake up call.I was told they do update their records well remember my card at check in . I PAID MY BILL IN CASH AND LEFT WHEN I RETURNED HOME DISCOVERED MY ACCOUNT HAD BEEN DEBITED WHEN I CHECKED IN FOR THE FULL AMOUNT  EVEN THOUGH I ASKED AT CHECKOUT IF MY CARD HAD BEEN DEBITED.  After several phone calls and different stories it took SEVEN days for my money to get back into my account.",2,2008,12,23
249,Never again,We arrived at the hotel and had to wait for 30 mins at reception. We got to the room and there wasn't even a bottle of water in the room even though the website said there was a mini bar in all the rooms. Room clean but bar filty and had 10 minute wait each time you wanted to order a drink. Restaurant was even worse. The staff so inexperienced and you felt like you wee being ignored. Asked for extra vegetables twice as they only gave us one portion to begin with and was ignored both times. Dirty linen and plates left in corridor at 7pm in the evening from that mornings checkouts. Smell in the corridor because of this was terrible. I definately wouldn't go back. I was not the only one who experienced this. I know alot of other guests who stayed at the me felt the same way. While we waited 45 minutes at check out we were able to chat. Very bad experience and would never recomend te hotel to anyone.,1,2008,12,17
249,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"We checked in on Thursday 11 December for  a 3 night stay, family of 5 with young children.  We were given a suite which is a 1 min walk from main building, the suite was huge with 1 bedroom and large room with a sofabed, kitchen area and bathroom.  We booked on a B&B basis and part of the deal was tickets to 7UP on ice in Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.  Buffet breakfast was excellent each morning, staff went out of their way to help with any requests.  
We used the leisure facilities, swimming pools were excellent, children's pool and adults were lovely.  I also used the Jacuzzi and sauna.  Bit slow checking out as there were about 20 people checking out, lady in front of us was complaining and it took staff a while to deal with her complaints.
Overall we had an excellent time and are thinking about booking again for the New Year. Great value for money.",5,2008,12,15
249,"Not great, lots of room for improvement, expect queues for everything","We booked a two night B&B and one meal deal for 2 adults and 2 children. Our check in was efficient but when we got to the room it smelled badly of cigarettes and when you don;t smoke yourself this was a turn off. As there were no more rooms we were given an apartment which was great and gave us some privacy. The apartment while nice had previous guests hairs in the bath which was a turn off but after complaining once already we dedcided to clean it ourselves, everything else was spotless. The bins were emptied on the second day and towels changed but our beds wern't made which I thought strange.  Dinner in the restaurant wasn't great, my husband had to send back his fishcake, it was stone cold in the middle and the rest of the food was average. Breakfast I would say was average (don;t have porridge, worst I've ever had) and our second morning there was no space in the restaurant so we were put into the bar with our own seperate buffet which was awful. I had to ask for everything, no bowls, no milk, no teaspoons etc etc etc.  Also maybe as it is the end of November and Christmas partys are in full swing there was queues for everything including a huge queue for breakfast and out the door to check in.

Overall we had a pleasant stay but there were too many things that could easily be improved and I wouldn't recommend this hotel and won't be staying again.",2,2008,11,30
249,massive room,"Hotel was a very good price. We stayed here for one night.
Checkin was quick and organised.

We paid an extra 30 euro for a slight upgrade which resulted in having a small sitting room/ kitchen area as well as the massive bedroom we found on opening our room door. 

The sitting room area contained  a two seater couch, an armchair and a tv. Nice to relax in and have our room service lunch.

We got a ceaser salad delivered for our lunch which was one of the nicest i have ever tasted. Would definitely advise any one to try it there.

The bedroom was three times the size of most hotel rooms, and it also contained a wide screen tv.

The windows were the full length of the room and looked very well when the curtains were pulled. 

The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.

Hotel is situated very close to liffey Valley shopping centre so it is a good locaion for shopping and cinema.

Would recommend a stay here.",4,2008,11,25
249,Perfect location,"I stayed for 3 nights last week, 1 visit during the week and the second on the weekend.  First night was Mon so check in was quick and efficient, room good sized, plenty of lighting. Had a sandwich from room service and it was lovely.  Check out was efficient.

I booked in again the following Fri night which was busy on checkin at 9:30pm.  Expect this on busy days they have 350 bedrooms. Reception were efficient and patient.  I asked for a quiet room away from the bar etc. and got a room at the other end of the hotel. The receptionist did warn me that it was a bit of a trek away but only took 2-3mins and was worth the peace.  Had breakfast which is buffet and there was a great choice from the cold buffet.  Hot buffet is standard.

They have a second carpark underground and I would recommend it.  Nice chicken in black bean sauce on room service again but they did warn me it would take an hour as the kitchens were very busy on Sat.  I skipped all the queues on Sunday to avoid the queues which you must expect with over 600 people staying.

All in all the location was great as I was doing business in Liffey valley, ideal if you are heading to airport also.  If driving there from the south, N7 you can avoid the redcow roundabout and the M50 and just take a left at Bewleys hotel on naas road and follow signs for clondalkin and lucan.  This is must faster.  Will stay again when in the area.  Didnt get a chance to use leisure facilities.",3,2008,11,25
249,Wasn't impressed,"I wasn't impressed with this hotel at all.  We got a fairly cold welcome on arrival.  I'd booked a suite with all the extras. None of the extras were in the room but at least they deducted this from our bill.  Suite was very plain. It had a separate kitchen area but no microwave so basically it was a sink and a fridge.  I definitely wouldn't stay here again.  We found it difficult enough to get parking.  The bar food was massively overpriced for what it was.  If you do stay here go elsewhere to eat, there are a few places in the shopping centre close by or go to the Arc Bar which seems to be better.",2,2008,11,22
249,rude staff a disgrace!!!,will never stay in this hotel again or recommend it to anyone. we were told the residents bar would be open til 3am. when we asked at reception why it wasnt open we were told it shuts at 1am. we were not the only ones complaining. the staff told other guests to leave if they didnt like it. the staff were very rude to us and other guests that were staying in this hotel. to top it all off the fire alarm went off at 4.30am. no member of staff came to any of the guests and told them it was a false alarm. there were kids running wild in the corridors at 3am. NEVER AGAIN!,1,2008,11,11
249,fantastic hotel ... not that far from city,"We found staff very helpful indeed.

Arrived In Dublin from Glasgow late afternoon of Sat 1st Nov and ventured to hotel by Flybus ( 8 euros each way per person ) Much cheaper than the £30 taxi fair on our return trip. Beware Dublin is extremely expensive!!! Defo not coming back which is a shame cause the city has so much potential. Fantastic tour bus ride through the gorgeous Capital of Ireland.

Cannot fault hotel. The restaurant in hotel is fairly competitively priced for food and the quality of food is 5 star. The restaurant is busy all night long. Room service is rather steep.

Used the sauna, steam room and spa facilities attached to hotel which received a resounding thumbs up. But beware at weekend tons of children screaming in the pool area.

Room was defo 4 star. Really nice. Lovely bathroom and despite previous complaint of poor service by staff. Everyone we requested help from was more than helpful!!

Beware - there are beggars outside the hotel. Near to the underpass where you can get a bus into Dublin. But it is highly recommended to get bus from Liffey Valley Shopping centre next to hotel. Tour bus for city actually picks you up every day at 10am from hotel which is fab!!! and it brings you back to hotel too around about 5pm.",4,2008,11,06
249,Good option for Park and Fly but staff were a little uninterested and curt,"Stayed here for one night before going on a last minute holiday.  They do a good deal for one night's stay with parking plus another 7 nights parking with free transfer to the airport.  I think they also do offers for 14 nights but check that out first as I am not sure.  We arrived late having been at work that day but there was no queue at reception and there were three staff members available.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to check in. 

The first question after ""How are you?"" is ""How will you be paying?""

If you choose to pay by cash they want another €100 cash in advance as a bond (In case, I suppose  with me being 4 months pregnant and hormonal they feared I might toss the tv out of the window).  If you opt to pay by laser or credit card they swipe the card and also keep handwritten copies of your card number.  I asked why the written copy of the number and got the fixed smile and automated ""hotel policy"" response.  ""Hotel Policy"" was as much as I got - there was no advance or development on what the policy actually was!

The room itself was nice - beds comfy and nice bathroom.  I find Clarions on the whole a little sterile anyway but nicely decorated nonetheless.  

The Park and Fly thing made things easier though as the hotel is right next to Liffey Valley Shopping Centre where the Spur restaurant is the perfect spot for a nice and easy meal when you arrive home from a long flight.  The accomodation plus parking worked out resonable compared with spending €7 per day to park outside in the long term car park at the airport.",3,2008,10,26
249,great find,"This was a great hotel but they greatly misrepresented some important issues in their booking documentation.  Great room - great decor, fabulous bed, nice tv, good shower, dreamy smelling toiletries, closet space,  etc.  Great gym and gorgeous pool.  Very nice staff.  Oh, the mini bar prices were even fairly reasonable and one night we got room service and the food was great.  A good place to recover from jet lag.  Right on the river and close to where you can pick up the hop on-hop off bus.  Great little convenience store very close by.  Here's the catch though:  when you book the hotel on the web and they provide you with the booking confirmation it TELLS you that there's a free shuttle from the airport.  THERE IS NOT A FREE SHUTTLE FROM THE AIRPORT TO THIS HOTEL.  The free shuttle at the airport takes you to the airport Clarion, not the Clarion in Dublin. It's a 30euro cab ride.  It was fine, I just wish I hadn't wasted all that time trying to find the bus.  Also, we booked a car through a link from that same confirmation.  It said it was in downtown Dublin but there are no car rental agencies in downtown Dublin, it's out in the suburbs.  Like a 20euro cab ride.  The thing was the hotel staff knew NOTHING about this stuff and it was THEIR site that we got the link off of.  Seems they need a little more synergy between their marketing, pos web and desk staffs.  other than that, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,2008,10,24
249,good travel stop,"Good rooms clean nice bathrooms ,great location for shops and ferry to Dublin from UK. Clean rooms- nice pool area and clean gym- if a little abandoned- gym feels underused and lacks music unless you have your hearphones but sufficent

 Bar area smells awful as can reception ,like old oil-. Not bad for an overnight stay if you are just passing-rates on weekend can be good. They have apartment-suites too.
Amazingly good food at The Arc next door-very highly reccommended.",3,2008,10,23
249,Superb!!,"We arrived on a Thursday earlier than expected and was checked in quickly and efficiently. One of our room wasnt ready so we were asked to just to one and they would bring the key to us when it was ready. That was not a problem! We arrived at the first room to see that we had been upgraded free of charge to a suite. The room was amazing! there was a kitchen, little dining area, lounge, bathroom and a bedroom. You couldnt have asked for more. We got the second key on our way out of the hotel and when we returned we realised we had been upgraded to another suite! Again an amazing room! We did want twin beds and got a double but this was quickly put right by sending a housekeeping team member up. Bedrooms were clean and bathrooms were nicely decorated. We ate in the restaurant that night and the service was faultless! we received our drinks and meals quickly and I have to say it was probably the best meal I had ever eaten (I recommend the Chump of Lamb!!) A thoroughly enjoyable weekend was had by all of us, would definately return and would 100% recommend. Staff are excellent.",5,2008,10,22
249,Nice hotel but quite a bit out of the city,"We were staying a long weekend (Sat - Tues) and arrived about 11am.  We had said we would arrive about 10.30am but did not expect to go to our rooms.  We checked in after a wait of about 10mins (2 people on the desk) and were given a room on the 4th floor.  The smell of smoke hit us as we entered the corridor and once the bedroom door was opened I was sure we were in a smoking room even before I noticed the ashtray.  As I had requested a non-smoking room I phoned reception to ask if there was any chance of a non-smoking room.  A lovely lady called Anna arranged for us to be moved and gave us a lovely suite on the 5th floor with a queen size bed, couch/bed, flat screen tv,balcony, kitchen area with fridge and microwave and lovely bathroom with power shower.  We were delighted with the room.  The only downside was that it looked onto spare ground and motorway so was very noisy when the balcony doors were open.  They were often open as there was no air conditioning (just a fan in the corner of the room) and the room was very hot at night.
Fortunately the weather was lovely for most of the weekend so we used the local buses (bought a bus pass) but it is about a 10 minute walk to the bus stop - so not ideal if the weather's bad.  The last day it was pouring so we got a taxi into the City Centre which cost us 22 euros.
It is about 10 minutes walk the other way to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.  
We had only booked the room - no breakfast or dinner and mostly ate out.  We had breakfast at The Arc which is just outside the hotel and it was nice enough but never sampled the hotels breakfast so can't comment on that.  We decided to eat dinner in the hotel on the Monday night but found the restaurant was closed and we had to go to the Kudos bar/restaurant.  I don't know if it is always closed on a Monday but no one told us - we only found out when we went to go for dinner.  The meal in Kudos was ok but only if you like really hot food.  The curry I ordered was listed as middling and I asked if it was hot and was told yes but they could make it cooler for me.  When it came it was so hot I was sweating eating it - if that was it cooled down I wouldn't have liked to taste it as it was!
The staff were just ok with the exception of Anna on reception - she was so pleasant and excellent to deal with (and Patrick the concierge was another who went out of his way for us).  
One annoying thing was every day when we came back our room keys did not work and we had to go all the way back down from the 5th floor to reception and wait in a 10 minute queue with only one person on reception to have the keys re-set.
If you are going to use the swimming pool you must wear a swimming cap for which they charge you 2.50 euros each.  We had our son with us and found it very difficult to decifer the times the pool was open for children - the information in the room contradicts itself a few times and we couldn't understand it.  We had to ask at the front desk what the times were.  When we went to swim we were told it wasn't children's opening times yet - but we had been given the information by reception.  I don't think anyone knows the childrens swimming times.
We had a good weekend and enjoyed the lovely room but it is not really handy if you don't have a car with you as the buses do not stop anywhere near enough the hotel.  This would put me off going there again unless we had a car with us.",4,2008,10,17
249,probably wont stay here again....,"it was our anniversary and we just wanted to get away for the night. we decided to stay at the clarion for the night. we arrived about 5pm and there was one person behing reception with at least 6 people waiting to check in. we waited for about 15 mins to check in. the receptionist was very helpful as she gave us info on the restaurant and the spa. our room was lovely, very spacious and comfortable. we went to the cinema in the shopping centre and when we returned at 10 pm there were alot of children running around the hotel and screaming. we filled out the breakfast form to have our breakfast in our room. we left it as late as possible to have breakfast which was 10.00-10.30 am. at 10.45 we had still not had our breakfast and i called reception. we were advised that we would have breakfast in 5-10 minutes. at 11.20am our brerakfast arrived. it was almost cold and the coffee was not drinkable. some items we had requested for breakfast were not provided. this put me off this hotel completely. if staying here i would suggest just pay for the room do not pay for B&B. there is a restaurant across the road that does breakfast.",2,2008,10,06
249,Enjoyed our stay at the Clarion,"We stayed at the Clarion for one night during mid-week September 2008 and enjoyed our stay.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful on the whole - particularly the concierge.  The room was spacious, well equipped, modern and clean with good facilities.  The property is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the centre of Dublin and costs around 20 euro.   The only real downside was the breakfast was not particularly appetising and there were dirty plates everywhere.",4,2008,09,23
249,Brilliant Weekend,"My experience at the Clarion Liffey Valley was fantastic.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  The room was very comfortable and clean and provided all the facilities that you needed.  I wasn't expecting the swimming pool and spa facilities and so was really pleasantly surprised. I thought it was an excellent location, brilliant parking facilities and easy access to town and of course the shopping centre.   A really nice hotel for a weekend break.  We ate in the hotel on the Saturday night of our stay and the food was excellent, with a nice friendly atmosphere in the bar.",5,2008,09,22
249,Decent enough - as expected,"The Clarion Suites is a decent business hotel, just off the N4 near the M50 in Dublin.  A good spot if you've got some suburban/industrial sites to visit while in the area.  There's a large shopping centre close by, an off-license and several restaurants in the adjacent retail area beside the hotel.  A good swimming pool and gym, but bring your bathing cap!  Rooms are fine - generic 4* business-focused with modern and clean decor and amenities.  Good Ceasar Salad from the room service menu.  Bar-fridge, nice tv and decent channels.  Check in was fine and the price was good for the quality.  Big, impersonal place, but it lives up to it's description and can't be faulted for doing what it says on the tin.  Request a 'courtyard' aka parking-lot facing room to avoid some of the N4/M50 noise.",3,2008,09,21
249,Great Hotel..pity about the food,"Hotel was very nice and the rooms were very clean and well layed out, the bathroom was very clean and it had all the extras required.  The only problem with the Clarion is the food, in particular the breakfast.  On Monday we came to breakfast at 9.20am and there were also people from 2 coach tours in the dining room and the place was bedlem.  there were not enough staff to clean the tables and keep the 'hot' breakfast tray topped up.  Hot which it wasjust luke warm and I asked for poached eggs which i was told there was just the hot menu even though there were people eating poached eggs and salmon.  Tuesday was slightly better but Wednesday was a complete disaster.  Again we arrived at 9.20am after the coach trips has left before 9am and nearly every table was full of empty dishes, not cleaned or was not set up.  Quite a few people including walked around for a few minutes to try and find a clean table in the end gave up and just sat down and got one of the staff to set it.  Some people even got their own cuttelry.  We had dinner on Tuesday night and you would,nt have thought it was the same place as we were well greteed and the waiter constantly attended to us.  The Kudos menu was not very varied and if you did,nt like hot or spicey food then the menu was limited.  no such thing as chicken & chips or any english dish.  The housekeeping staff were very friendly and evey time they passed us they had a great hello.",2,2008,09,17
249,dublin,"stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. modern and beautifully clean. the room had everything you could need. a large double and single bed. tea/coffee facilities, iron, haidryer, fan, a free safe. the breakfast was buffet style and good quality and the food in the kudos bar was also lovely. excellent gym/pool facilities.
flybus  transport direct to and from airport to the hotel door every hour for 8euro each.
bus stop nearby for cheap access to dublin centre.
this hotel was excellent value for money.  however i found dublin  in general very expensive. although the dart and luas very good value. it rained every day.",5,2008,09,04
249,Great Hotel and good value!,"Stayed in the Clarion on the last Saturday in August and was surprised to see it so busy!
The hotel was a lot bigger than I had expected and with ample carparking ( underground overflow carpark provided)

Check in was efficient, and we were allocated a double room on the underground floor, we were very hesitant about this, thinking noise would be a problem but the room was to the back so apart from the fact that our view was a wall we heard no noise!!

Room was spacious, clean and modern,

Bed is very comfy and tv is great!!has music albums stored so you can sing all night!!

We had dinner in Kudos and the combo starter was fab!! 
Only drawback is that it is not an official retaurant setting so people are drinking away beside you.

We went to the disco/bar Arc that  night and it is a lively spot with all ages went on til 2am, although the drink is very expensive!

We had lunch in the hotel bar the next day and it wasn'y good but the scones were fab!!

We used both the gym and the salon for massages and would reccommend both.

Staff in the gym are very friendly and helpful.

We ordered breakfast to the room at a cost of €20 per person. We shared one breakfast between 2 and there was plenty!

All in all I would def reccommend this hotel for a break away for good value!",4,2008,09,03
249,An Anniversary Dream,"We booked to stay at this hotel about 3 weeks before we were due to travel, for the occasion of our wedding anniversary.

We had already looked on here regarding the hotel and were pleased with what we had heard.

We e.mailed the hotel to advise of an early arrival and that we would like a quiet room ( it was our anniversary after all ).
A staff member Joanne, got back almost immediately and advised that she would try to allocate an upgrade to a suite due to the occasion.

The hotel is located a little out of town, but we were aware of this and arranged a hire car.
On arrival at the hotel which looks very nice indeed from the outset, we were advised our room was not ready, we had arranged to do a trip in Dublin that morning, so that was no hardship. We were also advised that we had indeed been upgraded to a suite. Our luggage was stored in a secure area while we were out for the day.
On return to the hotel, out room was ready.

What can we say, it was lovely. A large lounge with a kitchen area, complete with comfy sofa's tv and dining table and chairs.
Into a seperate  large bedroom, done out in muted tones with lovely bedding. Again tv, plently of storage space, hairdryer, safe ironing board, and lovely mood lights either side of the bed, very romantic!
The bathroom was large with a huge mirror, power shower and luxury complimentary toiletries, very nice touch.

We opted to have dinner served in out room since we had a dining suite, the meal we both had fillet steak was faultless and also cheaper than if we had eaten in the retaurant.
The wine list was limited and expensive, but there is an off licence on site, we picked up a very nice bottle or two of red for £10 each, better than the £30+ in the hotel.

We sampled the swimming pool and spa area. The pool is Very busy and Everyone has to wear a hat ( which is provided ) There are always alot of children in the pool..
There is however a jacuzzi, sauna and steam room which children are not allowed in.

Checkout was swift and well organised.
The staff at the hotel are no less than superb, they will do they're very best to accomodate any needs you may voice with them.
We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and intend to stay again ourselves.

We are looking forward to trying more of the Clarion Hotels based on how good this one is.",5,2008,08,27
249,Terrible hotel - the worst I've ever booked,"RESTAURANT:
Even though the tables have been set; they certainly had not been cleaned and food from the previous occupants removed.

I was expected to sit on a dirty seat still covered in food; the seating hostess was extremely upset when I refused to sit until it had been cleaned.  Once this had been done I was expected to sit on a damp seat.  I had to sit on a carrier bag.

The glasses had not been cleaned properly and we asked several times for salt/pepper and sugar which never arrived.

The cooked breakfasts were cold; our only alternative was soggy croissants or cold toast.  The tea is so strong you could strip wallpaper with it.

WAITING STAFF:
They will avoid you like the plague until you are about to leave.

ROOM:
If you are a non-smoker this is not the hotel for you.  We had to hold our breath and race along the corridor to our room.  The smell of smoke is choking.

I never once heard the sound of a hoover whilst walking from our room to the Reception area.  The hairball located just underneath our TV cabinet which was obvious on our arrival was never removed during our stay.

The mini bar was empty as I was told that guests are expected to use vending machines located on each floor.

BATHROOM:
I threw away the shampoo, body soap and handcream on arrival as it had been used and the contents congealed in the lid.

Everytime I returned to the room; they had been returned from the bin and placed back on the tray in the bathroom.  When I finally managed to bury the handcream deep in the bin...they never bothered to replace it so only two half empty tubes remained.

PARKING:
You can drive round and round to find a place; when you do see one become available everyone makes a mad dash for the empty space.

BAR:
My hot chocolate was more of a cool hot chocolate and it took ages to be served.

SWIMMING POOL:
This is the only good thing in the hotel as it is run by a different company.  It is however, full of children until very late.  So if you want a relaxing swim wait until at least 8pm.

CHECK-OUT:
Examine your bill every carefully.

The next time I stay at a bad hotel I will certainly be taking photos.",1,2008,08,25
249,Loved the Clarion Liffey Valley Dublin,"We spent 7 days in the Clarion and found it to be very clean and relaxing. The service was brilliant as when we asked for an extra towel at reception, the waiter came straight away. 
Went to the swimming pool and found it to be very clean as well. There is a sauna, a steam room, a pool, a jacuzzi and a pool for toddlers and younger children. 
Our room was a bit small and very hot  and unfortunately it overlooked the motorway but we got a fan from reception that cooled it off a lot more.
We spent a whole day in the city. I recommend going to the Guinness Storehouse as it is very fun. There are interesting machines to look at, information videos and at the top, in the Gravity Bar, you get a free pint of Guinness or a soft drink. There is also an amazing view from the top window - definitely worth doing but it is very busy and there is a long queue!!
Kilmainham Gaol is another must in Dublin but it is a lot of walking around. The guide is very interesting and it is fun exploring different parts of the famous jail. You can even go inside and take a look in some of the cells!!!
The Dublin Writers Museum is good as well but it takes a long time to get round as there is so much to look at.
The open top bus is good if you want a sit down and a look around the city.
In the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, near the hotel, there is a place called Kylemore. They do delicious fry ups with fried eggs, toast, black pudding, sausages, hash browns, baked beans and I recommend the freshly squeezed orange juice. Looovely!
Spurs Steakhouse is good but usually gets busy so you have to be there early. 
We went to Eddie Rockets once but weren't very pleased. It's very fun for kids because of it's posters on the walls and quotes saying, 'There ain't no finer diner' and 'No dancing in the aisles' and lots of amusing things but the food isn't excellent quality. Good if you want a burger or chips but the breakfast and anything else wasn't too good.
I also recommend a place in Lucan Village called Courtneys. It is a pub/restaurant and the lasagne is beautiful and the beef is scrumptious. It was one of the best places we ate at.
In Dublin City they have a place called Blarneys ( down Nassau Street, just beyond the Kilkenny shop) which is just out - of - this - world food. The service is brilliant and the food is better than anywhere else. The bacon and cabbage was beautiful and the Irish stew was tremendous. The apple crumble did it for my daughter and my husband enjoyed his scone. The only downfall for this place would be that the chefs are a bit heavy on the salt but apart from that, it is fab.
All the staff at Clarion are friendly and are extremely helpful. I recommend this hotel to anyone. The television has a good selection of channels, the bathroom shower was clean and the beds were very comfortable. This is a fabulous hotel  with excellent service and definitely is brilliant value for the price paid. Well done Clarion!",4,2008,08,24
249,Good For Families,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August - 2 Adults and 2 small children.  We had an executive room - one very large room with a king size bed and one living room with fold out sofa and a kitchenette.

The space was fantastic, our children had one room to themselves and we had our own room too.  Everyone slept really well!  The kitchen area was really useful - it was equiped with a microwave, fridge, sink and kettle.  Really useful with small children and we could have some meals there and keep things in the fridge for the duration of the trip.  We als had a table and chairs.

The hotel itself is very comfortable, the breakfast was great.  We ate in the bar on one evening and the food was excellent - asian/thai style food.  There is also a formal dining room but too fancy for small children.  

The location is good and is right beside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre which has everything.

The pool is good, and the kiddies pool is really big and more than satisfied our two children!

I would recommend it.",5,2008,08,21
249,great value for families,we got a great weekend rate by contacting the hotel reservations direct - E275 for two nights b/b and one evening meal for two adults and two children. nothing else in dublin comes close to this on price for families. although it is far out from the centre it is perfect for driving as you avoid the dublin traffic and there is a free car park. we had a great family room just a short step away from reception. it was spotless and had everything we could have asked for. the kids loved the pool and really enjoyed the childrens menu in the restaurant. the buffet breakfast was plentiful and we found all the staff to be very charming and helpful. i would not hesitate to stay there again.,5,2008,08,14
249,Fantastic 3 Days,"Spent 3 days  and loved it..The room was clean and comfortable (the television can be used  to wake you up, it has a radio and if you want an alernative for music you can listen to The Eagles, Madonna etc)
staff  very friendly and helpful..Note however that it  not too near the city centre but  there are  buses that you can get  which cost  2euros. there is a bus (Fly Bus)that you get   from the airport  which drops you right in front of the hotel and then it picks you up for the return journey so there are no hassles.",5,2008,08,13
249,Excellent Hotel!,"I've stayed in many hotels and I can honestly say the penthouse-apartment which me and my boyfriend stayed in was possibly the largest, it was bigger than my own apartment!! Around 700 rooms in the hotel. Its situated amost leisure complex comprising of cinema and a couple of bars. Approx 15 min taxi ride from the city centre (Cost around Eur 20). Check in was fast, room was spotless, taxis were fast in collecting us when we wanted to venture out. Leisure facilities were OK, sauna and steam were the usual, pool was OK. Beware though, unlike the UK, swimming hats are compulsary!! Food and drink within the hotel were reasonably priced.
Would love to stay there again when I get more time off work!!",5,2008,08,12
249,Geat Hotel Strange Rules!,"Recently stayed at this hotel for two nights, good location and only 15 minutes drive from the airport. A little way out from the centre but as we had a hire car and sat nav this was not a problem. The staff were polite, although most appeared to be eastern europeans, and the hotel was very clean.
The rooms were well presented and had all the usual refinements, tv, safe, tea & Coffee facilities etc..
We didn't eat at the hotel but the food looked good but expect to pay 4* prices. A pint at the bar will set you back 5 euros (4.16p a pint!). As a whole Dublin is the most expensive capital city in Europe, so bring plenty of cash!
A couple of strange rules in the hotel too. If you don't have a credit card attached to your room card you won't be able to buy a drink at the bar after 11.30 pm as they don't accept cash!! And although this is advertised as a family hotel kids under 18 cannot use any of the facilities except the pool, and you have to wear a swimming cap, unless you are bald!, you can buy these at the hotel for 2.5 euros. Overall a good hotel, with good facilities. The Liffey Valley shopping complex, which has a cinema, is only 10 mins walk away and has all the usual high street shops you can find in GB. For the more obscure shops head into Dublin Centre, my son bought a stuffed scorpion (don't ask why!!)",4,2008,07,29
249,Well Done Andrew & Laura,"Recently I stayed at the Clarion with my daughter and my in laws.  Although the hotel is nothing flash, I found the help recieved from Andrew McCarthy on the front desk brilliant.  What a helpful man.  
The rooms are clean and comfortable although some of them can be quite a trek from reception.
The Resturant in nice and the food better than I expected.  One of the waitress's Laura is brilliant.  Her customer service is second to none.  My in laws were really impressed with her.
The only problem I found was the lack of disabled parking and the room we were intially given with a disabled walk in shower was such a long walk from reception 'given its for disabled'  So not a lot of thought put into that one.  My in laws were exhausted by the time they reached it.   Other than that if you passing and want somewhere warm and clean to lay your head and some nice food then this is the spot for you.",4,2008,07,26
249,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel very good value for money staff friendly just 20mins from dublin city centre bus for 2adults 3 children 5 eur,4,2008,07,25
249,Lovely hotel,"This hotel was great if a little out of the way for the centre of Dublin.  We arrived and Bendan on reception was extremley helpful we had 3 ajoining rooms which was a great idea for the 6 of us. Modern decor in the rooms and beautiful flowers in reception area.  He also told us where to go in the town, advice that we followed and had a brilliant time.

I had a swim and jacuzi on the sunday morning which was lovely and clean and very relaxing.

Only 2euros on bus into town about half an hour journey.  Didnt eat at hotel but had a fab breakfast at the arc bar on site.

Dublin is expensive, but the irish charm makes it worth every penny.",5,2008,07,23
249,A bit out of the way as a tourist hotel,"This hotel was clean and very much in line with North American hotels standards.  But it was too far out of the way as a good spot to explore the down town with.  The adjacent shopping centre is actually not that large.  There is a bus stop nearby and the #78 runs to and from the down town centre, but it is about a 30 min bus ride and much longer during peak times.  If you want a place just to spend the night that is clean, offers nice rooms then this palce is for you.  If you are looking for a base to explore Dublin then look for somehting a bit close in - even if it costs a few dollars more.  The staff here were mostly english as a second language speakers and there was language problems.  Service was average - but don't expect any personalized touches.",2,2008,07,14
249,the best,"we are just back from a two night stay in the liffey valley clarion in dublin.the hotel is amazing,i had emailed when i booked it that i needed some extras in the room and the hotel secretary trish white rang me to see was there anything else that she could do to make our stay more comfortable,first class customer service from her.when we got there we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with balcony.i did however stupidly book the stay through supervalue getaway breaks and only that the hotel itself was great they're offer itself was a load of rubbish.it was two nights bed and breakfast and one evening meal for for two adults and one child for E259.when it came to the evening meal i had to pay for the childs meal as it only includes the adults meal in the deal,did you ever hear such rubbish .the maitre'd said thats the way supervalue do it all the time,and then i read that the clarion themselves are doing a deal for almost the same money but including a bottle of wine,i will definetly be back.great hotel great staff and great pool.",5,2008,07,13
249,loverlee..........,"We stayed at the Liffey Valley Clarion for just two nights booked via octopus travel. We were put in a suite which was fab, big, roomy and self contained. Five seconds walk from reception where the staff looked after every thing we asked for. They were friendly and approachable at all times. Even when a bit stressed due to the radar going down at Dublin Airport and ,making some holiday makers late to check in.
Ate in the Kudos restaurant on first night, excellent.
Liffey Valley shopping centre ten minutes walk and local buses into town going from there. 2 euros into town on the bus and expect to pay 15-20 in a taxi.
We ate in Lucan village on the secone evening at a pub called Courtneys, fantastic steak and salmon.
Dublin is not a cheap place, but we throughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2008,07,11
249,Good Hotel for the Price,"Me and my husband took advantage of the 1p Ryanair flights offer, and were trying to make this a relatively cheap city break, so we opted for the Clarion Hotel as it was reasonably priced for the rating and services it offered (I have to say though, if you're going to Dublin mainly for the nightlife then this isn't the hotel for you as it will be a more costly option in terms of transport to and from the city).  A 4 night stay cost us 288 euros. We were pleasantly surprised when we checked in as we were told that we'd been upgraded to an apartment.  This was great as we hadn't paid to upgrade to B&B so it meant we had a kitchen in which we could prepare a breakfast before we went out for the day.  I couldn't fault the apartment in terms of size or cleanliness (although it should be noted that you only receive a clean towel service daily and a full room service every 4 days) although the room was a little noisy from the nearby road, and the lounge area of the apartment did not have a TV which meant we ended up sitting on the bed when getting ready or eating breakfast!

If you're wanting to visit the city the taxis are expensive, and the bus stop is a good 15 minutes walk away (although the return stop is a little closer - you do have to cross a busy slip road, but it's directly outside of the hotel).  Whilst the 74a does go through all the estates, it directly passes the front of the hotel, and if you ask the driver they'll usually stop to let you out, as the next stop, Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, is the last stop on the route and you're usually the last people on the bus by then anyway.

We only ate in the Kudos bar (Asian food available before 10pm) and I have to say it was delicious and probably one of the most reasonably priced meals we had during our break.  If you're on a budget and don't mind stopping in room there is a take-out wine shop nearby which is much cheaper than drinking in the bar.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay there again if I go to Dublin for another sightseeing tour, but would consider one night in a city centre location just so I could make full use of the Temple Bar area without having to rely on buses or taxis.",4,2008,06,29
249,Great if you dont want all the busy ness of the city centre,"We have just arrrived back from a 3 day break to Dublin.  Having taken up the Ryan Air offer of flights for1p, we thought it would be a nice cheap break.  In total, the 2 night break cost about £450 
(and that was not being extravagant).  Dublin is not a cheap place...but is very nice.
To get from the airport to the hotel - if time is not an issue, I would recommend taken the bus.  Dublin bus company does a 3 day rover ticket for 11.50 euros, which allows you on all the buses for this time period.  There are two bus companies operating out of the airport. Dublin buses are the furthest from the terminal...only a thirty second walk.  The bus takes about 30 mins and i would suggest you get off at O'Connell street.  You then have a short walk (about 5 mins) straight down the road across the bridge into Westmoreland street, where the bus to the hotel goes from.  The 66 is one of the best (there is a whole list, but i forgot)....dont get the 74a as this goes all round the houses.  The buses come every ten mins, and it takes another half hour to get out to the hotel (east of the city)..again not a real problem.  You are dropped off on the motorway bus stop and are at the far end (M and S end) of the shopping centre.  The walk to the hotel is a good 10 mins ..go right and aim for the peugot garage.. we walked through the shopping centre which does distract you somewhat.    If however time is of the essence, a taxi costs about  30 euros.  Coming back on a saturday morning it took 30 mins, but in peak times i would allow much longer.  

The shopping centre also has a cinema, pizza hut, steak house (very nice), and burger diner.  All the prices appear to be on the high side but I guess that is just Dublin.  A one course meal with drinks in the steak house cost 50 euros.

The hotel is comfortable.  Nearly all the staff are east european, but very friendly and accommodating.  The leisure facilities are good.  Breakfast is wideranging...it costs 16 euros if you dont get it in your package.  There is a nearby restaurant that advertise breakfasts from 9-12 noon, but never tried it.  There is a bar (KUDOS) and we had a meal there which was reasonably priced for a hotel in dublin. (asian food -again about 50 euros for two people). The main restaurant was a little on the expensive side.  There are two restaruants nearby - the Arc and the Lemon grass, both    quite expensive but within 3 mins walking distance.  There is an M and S foodhall in the shopping centre, which could help with keeping costs down.

The bus tour of Dublin is a must.  You can get one of the tours straight from the door of the hotel at 10am..costing 15.5 euros each.  the tour lasts about 90 mins, along with 30 mins to get into the centre.  good commentary, and ideal for scoping what you want to look at in more detail.

Dublin airport is quite large, and it took a good 15 minutes to walk  to gates 70-78 - the ryanair area.

If you want to be at the centre of the nightlife and city centre, this is not the hotel for you.  If you are  not on a tight time scale, and are happy to use public transport this is ideal.  It is a lot cheaper than the town centre hotels, the rooms are spacious and it has good leisure facilities... so depending on what you want from your trip would determine whether this is for you,",4,2008,06,14
249,Be warned......,"I don't normally write on these as I have never felt strongly enough to do so. My trip at this hotel was so bad that I felt it necessary to warn others about it.

The hotel buidling is very nice but beyond that everything else is falling apart. The staff overall are rude and have no idea about Irish hospitality. I have to say there were the odd one like Patrick who would actually try and help you but one or two out of however many isn't enough.

The smoking rooms and floors did smell and though the rooms were nice the cleaning was very poor. In the rooms for 3 persons they would only ever leave towels, cups etc for two and if your ordered extra they would take a while to arrive.

The dining there is varied but for any of them - you best not be in a rush. It seems to take a minimum of 45 mins to get your food and getting drinks isn't much easier.  The Thai restaurant food was quite tasty but the main dining room was horrible. I have never been so disappointed. When we spoke to the Ops manager she said they had a bad day - but fom reading the reviews this is clearly not the case.

I would suggest you can get a better hotel for the same money - if not bring a lining bag to protect you from the bed bugs. If you do end up staying there - for food head over to the bar called Arc. They do a nice cavery and snacks. 

But do try and avoid.......",1,2008,05,27
249,avoid dining in the hotel,"I stayed in this holel at the weekend of the May Bank holiday. The rooms were ok but some cleaning needed on upholstery etc. it was a smoking room so it was not very fresh. I was surprised by a pair of dirty socks left in the plant pot on the balcony! However the dining experience was dreadful, we waited to be seated for 20 minutes for a table we had booked (others were joining us to celebrate a birthday) and then were left waiting for 35 minutes before the order was taken. At this stage others left and there were 12 tables that needed clearing. We ordered a main course only as it was so late at this stage. The food was warm, not hot, dried out and not good. I was ashamed for the French tourists who were at the next table. Prices are high but it is a 4 star hotel in Dublin. We did not order dessert or coffee.Service was very poor. This hotel has great potential, great location etc.",2,2008,05,13
249,dont eat the bacon,"i had a bit of a mixed stay at the hotel. first night we had a meal in the restaurant, which i must say was very nice, but was a little bit pricey, but expected in a 4 star hotel.  

its a bit of way out of the centre, although there is a bus stop near the hotel that takes you straight into the centre,  but takes about 30mins, but we didnt mind it too much.  

however, we got back late one nite and ordered room service, and basically i got a bad case of food poisoning.  the hotel at first wouldnt accept this and tried to make out i was merely hungover, but soon changed there tune as soon as the doctor confirmed that it was, and he advised me to go to hospital. from this point forward they were helpful, sorted evrythin out for me and they gave me a compensation package - despite saying until there examination took place they would not admit fault, and they would contact me about this after we left (which they didnt). we also asked them to clean the room for obvious reasons, but they didnt change the sheets.  i can't comment on the gym and swimming pool as, never had change to use them.

but as long as you avoid the room service, the hotel was ok. the rooms were quite nice, theres a shopping centre nearby, staff - depends which one you deal with - some were friendly, others were a little rude, (possibly because me being young, they felt they could get away with).  if your looking for somewhere central though, this isnt the place to go, id only really recommend if you have a car, or are prepared to get the bus.

general about dublin - guiness factory is a good experience, if you get chance go into a pub that has riverdancing, was a great night",2,2008,04,21
249,4* but variable,"Just read some of the reviews for the Clarion and have to agree with all of the comments made. This is a very convenient hotel, not too expensive, the pool is lovely, it can be full of kids (I had 3 with me), the smoking rooms stink (ask for non smoking), the motorway is noisy (ask for a front facing room), Liffy Valley is 2 mins away, the rooms are very warm and the staff busy (big hotel). We stayed there for 5 days. Had to change rooms because the heating was so noisy and we couldn't open the window because the motorway was too noisy . Changed room next day, no problem. The suite was a little more expensive but worth it. 
There are much nicer hotels in Dublin and surrounding areas. I personally wouldn't use the Clarion again but it is convenient, clean and reasonable. 
On check out I asked to see the duty manager and said that I wasn't pleased with the overall standard of the hotel and asked for a discount, he went away for 2 mins and came back and offered 25% which I happily accepted.",3,2008,03,31
249,Lovely hotel,"Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel , The room was great everything we could possibly need including iron / ironing board, fridge ,tv, hairdryer, and safe , free internet access if you bring your laptop or pay per day 10 Euros to use thier internet access , the safe and tv are provided free of charge , movies are available at an extra charge.the beds were very comfortable.and the room was spotless, and the staff were pleasant . the swimming pool, sauna and gym looked great but we didnt get time to try them out. ( towels are provided when you use the pool etc ) bathing cap is compulsory if u want to use the pool but are available to purchase at the pool for 2.50 euros each.

The downside our room overlooked the very busy N4 motorway and there was a lot off noise both day and night, The hotel is also very out of the way being 6 miles from dublin and 9 miles from the airport.. there is a huge shopping centre nearby approx 15 mins walk away or about 5 euros by taxi., a lovely shopping centre .

To get to the hotel from the airport is also difficult by bus as you have to first travel into dublin on bus number 747 and then get a bus from dublin to the liffey valley shopping centre bus number 66 or 25, then walk over to the hotel , , we ate at the nearby shopping centre a steakhouse opposite the cinema and i wouldnt reccomend it bland tasteless cold food and expensive to boot.

Tip.... if there are 2 adults and up to 4 children , buy a family day ticket  cost 8.50 euros from the information desk at the airport the desk is just before you go out of the doors to the bus station . this will save you money even if just 2 adults are traveling to the hotel via dublin as it costs 7.70 euros each if you pay when you get on each bus, if you need any help there are plenty of staff at the bus station to advise you. and the drivers in dublin are very helpful should you not be able to spot an inspector when you need one, there are quite a few around in dublin though. buses are very frequent and we found getting from the airport to dublin and then from dublin to the liffey valley shopping centre very easy.  one drawback was that most buses only pass the shopping centre stopping on the busy n4 motorway , but there is a bridge so you can safely get accross to the shopping centre, we found that the walk to the bus stop from the hotel took us 25mins.. alternatively you can get the number 78 bus into dublin from outside the doors off the shopping centre but this one takes an hour to get to dublin instead of 25 mins on the 66 or 25 buses. family bus day tickets.can also be purchased in the newsagents in the liffey valley shopping centre but it doesnt open till at least ten am.

one thing to watch out for the kerb stones near the hotel They are not flat as you would expect as i found out to my cost , when we arrived at the hotel it was dark i assumed the kerbstone was flat but the outside half is slanted , which caused me to loose my balance and i went flying !!! which left me in agony for the whole off my stay and im still no better now. either bruised my ribs badly or cracked them when i fell so beware . I really do think they are a hazard.

next door to the hotel is an off licence called cheers and its much cheaper to buy your drinks in there than in the hotel bar which was very expensive 11 euros for 2 drinks. In the off licence you can purchase a can off lager or cider etc for 1.40 euros each. and wine from about 5 eiros a bottle. plenty off choice drinkwise too. they also sell snacks ,crisps etc. it was open quite late as we went in about 8pm . might be an idea to take a wine / bottle opener with you to the hotel though !!!

all in all a lovely hotel just a shame about the noise from the motorway and its very remote location. and the very dangerous kerbstones !!!!",5,2008,03,03
249,A good hotel in Dublin,"We stayed in the hotel last night. We arrived early and were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. The room was excellent. We had a double and single bed in it. There was also a fridge in the room, which was helpful. We used the swimming pool, which was family friendly and the water was warm. Our price included breakfast. The food was beautiful and plenty of it, however the high chair which we were given for our baby was dirty and so was some crockery and cutlery. All in all an excellent hotel and we would stay here again.",4,2008,03,02
249,"Fabulous hotel, bit out of the way though","Spent one night in the Clarion in Liffey Valley.  The location is close to M50 and airport, bit out of the way of city centre but directly beside the Liffey Valley shopping centre.

The hotel itself is very big, i recommend getting a front facing room to avoid the noise of the N4 to the rear.
Upon arrival we were given an upgrade to an executive room which was very nice of the young receptionist.  He certainly made us feel welcome.  I have read some of the previous comments and I found a hotel which didnt match a lot of the negative criteria other people found.

The room was lovely, very well presented, view was fine overlooking the shopping centre.  A nice touch was the morning day bag of goodies we got.  It was a small but nice gesture of some bottled water, fruit and pringles.  

Breakfast was ok...only ok.  It filled us up and was pleasant but nothing mad to write home about.  

All in all I was really happy with my stay in the Clarion.  The location suited us that night in question and I was very impressed to be upgraded.  A nice hotel overall.",4,2008,02,19
249,No complaints!,"Just home from a weekend break in this hotel and I really don't have any complaints.  Its a big hotel so not very personal but the rooms were very clean with everything provided including ironing board and iron. The reception staff were very busy and maybe don't have time to chat  but we found them very helpful.  We stayed, two couples, on a weekend break with dinner provided on one evening and the food was delicious with a good choice, we ate in the Kudos restaurant the second evening and it was really good too. Maybe a holiday weekend and there were a lot of children about but so what! - it didn't bother us. The hotel is quite near a bus stop into Dublin and we got  a taxi back out for 18 euros and were quite happy to eat in the hotel.  Car parking at the hotel was easy and we left the car there most of the weekend. We had a very good weekend break and would recommend the hotel to anyone. We shall certainly go back again.",5,2008,02,18
249,Awful experience...,"Booked a 2night stay for myself , husband and 2yr old. Few days before arriving I e-mailed to confirm my booking and that I wanted a non-smoking quiet room.  Did not get a reply or a return phone call.  Arrived haf an hr before check in, met by rude receptionist, stephanie', made us feel like we were imposing.  Got to room, smell of smoke was sickening, am heavily pregnant so was feeling it worse than ever..  went back down to reception and noticed a sign for an upgrade, e35 per night, extras included 'king size bed'.  We opted for this but were told by stephanie she didnt have any idea when room be ready and to go and come back later!!  Room was ready 20 mins later.. when we finally reached it (was very far away from reception) I was dissapointed to see 2single beds stuck together, advertised as a king sized bed!!!  The suite was overlooking a loud and busy motor way,  it was much too warm and when I went to open a window a cloud of dust rose from the net curtains.  Also there was a strong smell of feet in each room, the carpets were stained and there was a layer of dust, everywhere..  I rang to request yet another room ,told it be the next day.  After a bad sleep (inter-connecting rooms, woman next door was on phone banging doors etc..), we were given same room but on other side of corridor.  (Oh and the breakfast we ordered to be delivered, was cold, they got order wrong,didnt bother complianing just went out to have breakfast in nearby liffey valley). On arriving to 'new room' dust,dirt,smell of feet and very noisy, same as before.  Asked for dinner  (included in package)to be sent to room.  Chose from menu then when meal finally arrived we were billed for it!!  Told room-service there was mistake he said not to worry it would be sorted.  Rang front desk to confirm this and was assured I would not be charged.  That night, due to dust etc etc we decided to check out a night early.  Went to reception, the night time manager was very ignorant and started shouting at me for eating the meal we ordered.  said it was my own fault and left me nearly in tears.  I will NEVER stay in a Clarion hotel again.",1,2008,02,10
249,Clarion was ok for what we wanted,"My Australian neice was marrying a Dubliner so many members of the family (from Australia and Holland) wanted a hotel for three nights prior to this occasion that was close to where the wedding would be held, was reasonably priced and was big enough to provide accommodation for us all.  Clarion Liffey Valley is absolutely huge!  I have read earlier reviews and was a little surprised.  Our experience was, for the most part, positive.  We were a long walk from reception but that didn't bother us - we view that as exercise.  The staff were efficient, polite, and helpful when we needed taxis for the large group and urgent dry cleaning.  It is a very busy hotel so friendly chats were just not possible.  We were  there during a midterm break and there were lots of children but as the hotel was so big it didn't seem to impact on us.
I wasn't terribly impressed with the restaurant we went to one evening in the hotel - there may have been others - the food was ok but nothing special and quite expensive.  Breakfast was a little chaotic but quite ok.  
The room was large and very clean, complete with iron and ironing board which was useful for wedding guests who had crushed clothes from travelling.
This hotel would not be suitable for people who wanted to stay in Dublin - it is approximately a 30minute bus ride from the city.  A large shopping centre is a ten minute walk away.  There is a restaurant/night club across the road and some people found this noisy.
This hotel suited us for what we wanted and was not too expensive - it is hard to find a reasonably priced hotel in Dublin City.  We did book our rooms on the hotel's web site well ahead and so obtained a ""hot price"" deal.",4,2008,01,31
249,4 star????,"Advertises as a 4 star hotel but really it's like a motel. Reception is always crowded, you can't check in or out. Kids running around everywhere. It's in a busy area with easy access to the motorway m50 and liffey valley shopping centre but it carries over all the noise and negative points associated. Sano Vitae centre attached for leisure facilities is very unsafe for personal belongings despite the best efforts from staff (keys for lockers, checks every 15 minutes). not pleasant or relaxing. Jacuzzi is way too hot. This hotel was only built last year and already it's looking tired. smells like an ashtray and has no personality. The staff try but is there really any need to have breakfast trays left outside rooms all day! they were there when we checked in at 6.00pm and still there when we were going to bed at 1.00 am. Overall not a great impression. Avoid if possible.",2,2008,01,27
249,Loved the Clarion Liffey Valley,"Had a great weekend in hotel, Food, Room etc excellent",5,2008,01,25
249,Excellent,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. From beginning to end this was an excellent experience. Hotel is beautiful and staff very polite. When you stay in this hotel you get complimentary use of the pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. The hotel is away from the city centre but bus stop is only 3 minute walk. Taxi's to the city centre cost approximately 20 euros. The rooms in this hotel where lovely and very clean. I would definetly stay here again.",5,2008,01,21
249,OK but too far from the action,"I spent three nights at the Clarion with a couple of friends. The hotel itself was very clean and offered good value for money but was ideal for business people - not tourists travelling to Dublin.

There were bus links about a 10 minute walk away and in all, we allowed about 45 minutes to get to the city centre - not bad, but a pain if you're hoping to stay out late.

The beds and rooms were very comfortable but even with the radiators off, things got a little too warm as there was no option for air conditioning. 

The fire alarm went off twice on our first night and I awoke two nights in a row at 5am because of a strange banging noise in the corridor. Judging from other reviews, I'm guessing this was the central heating!!

Seeing as the hotel itself was nice, I feel bad for writing about these problems as they might have been one-offs but even so, I wouldn't choose to stay here again.",3,2008,01,21
249,The weakest link,"The room was fine and the bed good. The facility also incorporated an excellent gym, fitness centre and swimming pool complex. Despite this, we were indeed disappointed with our choice mainly because we did not get that ""welcome, we hope you enjoy our stay"" feeling from the moment we walked through the front door. The reception staff had that ""I don't to really want to be here"" demeanour and the service given matched this.  Although there was a note from the Manager in the room extending a ""very warm welcome"", the front desk experience somewhat cruelled this.

The welcome aside, I would suggest this hotel would appeal to younger families. There is the Liffey Valley shopping complex in very close proximity, however apart from this the hotel is reasonably isolated.  Dining options had a heavy Asian focus, so if you are after a more Irish feel, look elsewhere. In summary, this chain of hotels will not be my first future choice in accommodation establishments.  Hopefully this one is their weakest link.",2,2007,12,29
249,Horrible,"We arrived at the clarion hotel for a weekend ""break"" with our 11mth old son, our first break together as a family and really looking forward to it.  We had reccomended the hotel to a cousin of mine and her partner to join us for the night for dinner.  I had a babysitter booked and looking forward to the night ahead, no child in tow!  We arrived to the restaurant and was seated and presented with a menu which we ordered from, the meal I have to say was lovely but spoiled when I went up to pay for wine etc the restaurant supervisor advised me that the menu we dined on was not included in my package!! I was confused as I phoned a couple of days previous to book the meal and explained that I was on a package so it was surely up to them to check what menu I should have been presented!! I felt like I was been discriminated against as I booked a special offer and should have been on the other side of the restaurant qeueing with a bowl for some slop!  As a guest I did not know that I should have had been given another menu as no choice or question regarding package was mentioned!  I was also very embarrased as I had invited the other couple for dinner.  

will not be returning to this hotel!!!!",1,2007,12,03
249,Buy some more cork screws................................!!,"We booked an executive room for one night.  The ""extras"" included: robes, slippers, free newspaper, half bottle of wine and a snack box.  On arrival, the suite was lovely, although I do think the bathroom is quite small for a 4* property,  There was a brown paper bag on the table in the living area and inside was the half bottle of wine, small box of pringles and one kitkat (not much of a snack box), I do think if the hotels are going to offer this deal, they should give the regular sizes of the snacks they are providing, just looks a bit skimpy.  The half bottle of wine was a good brand, but again I think it should have been a full bottle (even if they charged a little extra for the room, it would just look much better).  Anyway, when we went to open the wine, no cork screw.  Rang reception, who transferred me to the restaurant and they told me that they had to send someone up to open it as they don't have any spare cork screws!!!!!!  The very nice waiter arrived after about 10 mins, not bad at all considering our room was a long, long way from the restaurant, he opened the wine and left with his tip.  Now I have 2 issues here, why don't they provide a cork screw for the complimentary bottle of wine they give you?  Secondly, because you have to wait for the kind waiter to come and do it, you feel obligated to tip him, so you kinda pay for the wine anyway!  One easy solution to this would be for the hotel to source half bottles or indeed full bottles of screw top bottles, a simple solution to a simple problem.  Oh, and we didn't get our complimentary evening paper either - but there were loads of free copies for all in the lobby and bar area, so not much of an ""extra"" anyway!

Breakfast was buffet style and to be honest, it was chaos.  I know we arrived almost at the end when all and sundry wanted their breakfast too, but the plentiful staff just couldn't seem to cope.  All staff should have a station to look after - here they were just running everywhere trying to be all things to everyone, this never works.  The hot products were not hot and this is always bad in ta buffet - why don't hotels spend a bit of money on good hot plates etc.  Most tables were not fully set, people (including us) were taking whatever we needed from the empty set tables nearby, so the problem just went on and on, we actually had a laugh over it, watching people going from table to table.  All in all, there's not much wrong with it and definitely nothing that a bit of better organisation wouldn't correct.

I would stay here again if it suited but I would stay in a regular room and definitely ask to be nearer reception than we were, took at least 7-8 mins to get to our room from check in!",2,2007,11,11
249,Safety in hotel,"We stayed in this hotel again for the mid term break this year as we had an enjoyable stay there last year.  We were staying for 3 nights.  On the second night we woke to the sound of the fire alarm.  We organised ourselves and two young children to get out.  We went down to reception and were told that they didn't know whether it was a fire or somebody smoking in a bedroom and were told to go back to bed.  The staff were trying to reset the button.  The alarm went off four times and they were still telling people to go back to bed.  There was chaos in the hotel.  Residences had to contact the fire service.  Staff didn't appear to have any training on what to do.  

Fortunately, there was no fire in the hotel because if there had been there wasnt a proper fire safey program in place.

The following morning after no sleep, distress and upset to both adults and especially children it was actually brushed under the carpet as if nothing had ever happened.

It makes you wonder why they have a four star rating",2,2007,11,02
249,Stay Away Unless Sleepless Nights is what you want,"We stayed in the Clarion for 2nights in May 2007.We had stayed in this hotel a few times previously and had found everything more than satisfactory on those occasions for the rate we  paid.However I am afraid things have changed considerably since.The hotel seems to be experiencing  problems(an understatement) with their heating system.At approx 3am in the morning of our last stay we were awoken by what seemed to be our own personal generator!!The noise was in fact from the radiators in the room.We tried to turn off the radiators but that didn't improve things.I went around the corridor on our floor to get to the source and discovered that the noise was not exclusive to our room but the main wing of the hotel.I spoke to a member of staff who I met in the corridor.When I asked about the noise he smiled although trying to act surprised and said somebody had mentioned similar experience last week  and he would advise management in the morning.It was a performance worthy of Fair City/Hollyoaks/Days of Our Lives!!!I returned to my room bemused and somehow at 5.30am my partner and I got back to sleep.The next morning after breakfast I explained what had happened to the receptionist.Again the look of surprise was perfected,but this time with the addition of a shrug of the shoulders indicating the feeling of ""I don't care, I don't have to sleep here"".On futher questioning she changed her story and  advised me they were aware of the problem which will be looked at by engineers during the week .On asking for another room for our second evening I was told that this would make no difference.An appology seemed very expensive for the hotel receptionist to offer so we walked away dejected and not wanting to make a fuss,accepting the faith of another sleepless night.I did however request that she inform the Manager of our dissatisfaction and asked politely that he get back to us if he cared---He didn't.We left after the same experience on our second night.

THE LATEST
I have just spoken to a family member today 25th Oct 07 who was not aware of our experience--guess what they have just returned from a stay in this hotel and everything was exactly the same regarding noise/sleepless nights.Except this time they requested  a different room during the night (4am) and were given the bonus of a room without electricity!!!!Did  anybody care on checkout?--Why would they when more victims were waiting to check in.How can such a lack of care be shown to customers?

Any hotel can have once off problems,but having the same serious problems 6months later --There is no excuse.",1,2007,10,25
249,Noisy,"I stayed in the Clarion for one night last weekend. The room was clean and pleasant, although a little cramped. However, I have never been in a noisier hotel room. The children next door were screeching until well after midnight. I appreciate that this may just be one of those things you have to put up with if you happen to be next door to a family, but the noise from outside the window was worse. Constant traffic. I would have thought that a newly built hotel would have had some sort of soundproofing. 
I ordered breakfast from room service, and was most disappointed with the cold, greasy meal that was delivered.
Also, the minibar was empty.
While I found the staff friendly and helpul, I will not be returning to this hotel.",3,2007,10,16
249,Loved The Clarion Liffey!,"Excellent hotel! We have just returned from a 2 night weekend away and enjoyed every minute of it.  The highlight being the Clarion Liffey Valley Hotel.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded at check in from a normal room to a 1 bed apt in the suites building which was FANTASTIC! Firstly you need your room key to enter the building which made us feel very safe and secure.  The apartment itself was huge and very nicely decorated.  Full kitchen area with everything you need.  Tea, coffee and milk are provided.  We really enjoyed being out of the center of Dublin which is only a 20 euro taxi ride away anyway.  The price of a taxi from Dublin airport to the Clarion Liffey Valley was 30 euros.  Some tips we picked up:- There is an off licence just across the road, 2 min walk that we picked up our weekend alcohol from.  In the same place is the Arc bar/cafe great for breakfast, we had the full Irish and loved it!  Kudos Thai resturant within the hotel was fantastic, you must try the cocktails!  Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and courteous.  We went as a four with our friends and would def recommend booking a 1 bed suite as having all the space of the lounge area for pre and post dinner drinks was priceless.  Would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2007,10,15
249,Out of town but good hotel,"This is a nice hotel, very clean, good sized room, two nice restaurants within the hotel (I particulalry enjoyed the oriental one) and others within the shopping centre. Price included access to the on-site gym and pool which was a nice added bonus. Staff were on the whole friendly, but two I encountered at reception left a little to be desired, but I would still stay here again.

It's a couple of miles out of Dublin city centre, but you can walk to the bus stop, which is through the shopping centre car park. The shopping centre was handy too. We were staying in Dublin for a music festival, and the Marks & Spencer within the centre meant we could pick up our lunch each day.",3,2007,10,08
249,FILTHY BALCONY DOORS AND WINDOWS,"We thought the price was reasonable for a four star hotel - four star this was decidedly NOT.  Arrived at 4pm and room was not ready - waited 45 mins and went up to twin room with balcony, with what would have been a panoramic view over the M50 if we could see out the windows!  Genuinely I do not believe the balcony glass doors had ever been cleaned since the building was constructed.  Otherwise the room was ok, not spectacular.  As we were tired we decided on a room service curry - which was appalling with a few bits of precooked meat thrown in a 'soup' of chip shop curry sauce (the kind they buy in a 50 litre drum).  Breakfast was unfortunately even worse - bright yellow and blueish powdered scrambled egg, the cheapest cuts of bacon and no fried eggs on offer.  Another annoyance was a minibar charge for a Coke on our bill €2.60 which we did not have and no one had actually checked the minibar (we paid before breakfast) and I did not notice at the time.  Just think - if they charged everyone for just one coke they did not have - a tidy profit.  Definitely would not go back.  I actually took the trouble of writing the Managing Director of the group an email about the hotel and never even got the courtesy of a reply.",2,2007,10,06
249,`very negative experience,"We stayed in the clarion, lif valley for one night and had a very negative experience. The hotel lacks any charm, ambience or character. We found a number of problems:

- From the moment we entered the hotel we developed a very negative impression, the reception staff were slow, inefficient and we were left waiting for at least 20 mins, far too long

-Road works were going on right outside the hotel and no-where was there a sign to apologise for the noise and inconvenience to customers. 

-On walking to our ground floor room, the hall-ways had breakfast trays strewn across the floor at 3 in the evening! Not only was this a safety hazard while trying to carry bags it also must be seen as a health risk for mice and other rodents

-Our room while clean, had 2 doors either side obviously with the option of a family room. this was very dis-pleasing as we could get the smell of smoke from the room next to us at 7 in the morning, as non-smokers we found this horrible to wake up to. Surely the management should organise the hotel into smoking and non-smoking sections. 

-The food in the resturant was the most disappointing. The service was poor, the menu very limited and pricey,and the portions tiny. we were also over-charged for our meal. The restaurant lacked character, atmosphere, even some music would have helped 

-Some of the waiting staff wore heels in the marble floor  restaurant,  so the constant noise of clicking shoes was again very irritating 

overall a very un-pleasant stay i would not recommened this hotel for any purpose",1,2007,09,24
249,Good Hotel!,"Just returned from a 2 night break at the Clarion. Travelled from the air port by a bus into the city centre then a bus to the hotel, bus stop about a 5 min walk from hotel. When we checked in I tod them we were celbrating my 21st birthday (which we were) and they upgraded us to an executive suite! Staff were very kind throughout the whole trip, would always do what they could to help you out. First morning we had breakfast at the Arc across the car park from the hotel, it is cheaper than breakfast at the hotel, but staff were miserable an breakfast was not that great. The second morning we had breakfast in the hotel and it was a lot better. Room was gorgeous, huge very comfy bed, well decorated. We were woken up at 6am on the first morning by wake up call that we did not request and an hour later woken up by construction works outside the hotel, this is my only negative point about the hotel, we complained to reception and they did not even apologise! I would definetly come back to this hotel but would hire a car, as although the bus only takes about 20-25 mins, and the stop is a 5 min walk, its just a litte bit of a hasse. Swimming area and gym were nice.
All in all very good!
",5,2007,09,23
249,Terrible Irish Breakfasts,"In contrast to the previous reviewer I would just like to point out that breakfasts at the Clarion are quite the worst known to humanity and should be avoided. I stay here regularly and always book room only. Breakfast, at 20euro per head, is how this place makes its money. A coachload of pensioners, a thousand euro a pop.

This hotel is almost good, and its failings are a bit frustrating. It is actually rather stylish, especially for the money (internet deals often to be had at 70euro p.n.). When you get to your room, your first reaction will be pleasant surprise.

The problem is lack of air-con in the rooms, exacerbated by tiny-openings on the windows. It's just stuffy stuffy stuffy. The designer went for it - looks and feels like 4-star in the bathroom - but perhaps the money ran out when it came to air con.

Also beds and bedding flatter to deceive and I don't always get athe best night's sleep here.

Now my other gripe - the bar. It's generally fine. Come about 11 or 11.30, they evict you from the main bar into the adjoining 'snug' bar. Tedious, your whole party gets up and decamps 5 yards. Don't settle too long though. An hour later, they evict you again to the lobby. Various partition doors slam shut during this daft performance. Bit by bit, they chase you across the hotel, until you reach your bedroom. The night porter is not allowed to bring you any snacks, but he is allowed to take snacks to your room. Well you can always order from the lobby, run up to your room, and bring it back down to the lobby.

One workaround for breakfasts is to avoid the organised breakfast (disgusting packet eggs, vile coffee), and nip to the coffee shop next door where they have a proper coffee machine. With the odd tip/buit of charm they may even nab you a croissant too from next door.

The apartments are really nice and if the hotel is full you may get a lucky upgrade. In fact these are probably a better bet at an average rate of about 130euro.
",3,2007,09,23
249,Great Irish Breakfasts,"It was a bit of a trial getting to the hotel from the airport, our hire car developed a puncture before we left the airport environs!  We arrived on a Sunday and the traffic was horrendous, the whole of Dublin must have been on the move.  With loads of motorway works also going on we crawled most of the way to the hotel. 
The good news was that the hotel exceeded our expectations, there was always a cheery hello from staff, although the receptionists took themselves rather seriously.  We were very pleasantly surprised with the standard of the hotel, the service and the facilities, although it was rather difficult getting served at the bar as there were not enough staff on.
In retrospect, we should have stayed in the city, it would have been easier to get and see everywhere by foot or bus.  Whilst the food at the hotel looked perfectly ok, it was a tad expensive and we wanted to sample more traditional fare in Dublin.  Equally, go for breakfast at the pub next to the hotel, or the Deadman's Inn which is pretty close.  It's a lot less expensive and excellent value for money.
The hotel is pretty well next to an exit off the motorway, with major roadworks going on above, and on the surrounding slip roads, be prepared for delays if you're venturing on them.  It took us one hour to get from the hotel to the slip road on our way back to the airport, a distance of around half a mile.  then, you have toll booths some 1000 metres on from the slip road entrance.
A very good hotel but not best placed for what we needed.
",5,2007,09,17
249,Stay in the City!!,"Just returned from Dublin after a 2 night stay at the Clarion.
Mixed feelings about this hotel...
good points - pool area/steam room and sauna

Bad points....ignorant staff who are mainly foreign and don't know how to smile....ordered room service but they wouldn't deliver as refused to leave 100 euro deposit upon check-in!!
Breakfast good if you go early awful if you go late as the scrambled egg has turned to rubber and the toast turned to rusk!!
Expect to see peoples finished/part finished room service trays of food outisde their rooms for at least 12 hours before it's moved possibly longer we walked past the same tray two days on the run..surprised the place ain't over run with rats!!
Room 646 has the hardest bed ever like sleeing on concrete..avoid it!!

Near the hotel are major road works and it's a nightmare trying to get anywhere..cost 30 euros from the airport and took 50 minutes!

The shopping centre is huge however is a 10-15 minute walk depending on how fast you can  walk and has all the usual high street names.

There is a nice bar opposite called Arc which gets lively at the weekends and if you want to go a little further head around the corner from the hotel and go to Deadman's Inn who do a fab carvery from 12-4pm for 12 euros plus nice sandwiches..it's the only pub in the area with Irish staff!!

All in all not too bad but unless you want a pool/steam/sauna stay in the city it cost a fortune for taxis..the bus stop is 15 mins away and due to all the road works everywhere is gridlocked!!

Nearly forgot go to the off licence opposite the hotel called Cheers and get your wine and drinks to have in your room before you go out..a pint of cider cost £4.00 in Arc...you'll need a bank loan!!
",2,2007,09,15
249,not impressed,"This was a return visit to this hotel, we stayed here in November last year and were happy so we booked it with confidence when we were in Dublin on business last month.  No problems with room, and the staff are very good but what has happened the bar area?  We were there on a Sunday night and went for a drink about 10:00pm.  It was awful!. There was food and rubbish on the floor, all over not just at our table. The furnishings were worn and stained and someone had carved their initials into our table! There also were a couple of tables of very loud, drunk guests (?) but the staff made no attempt to ask them to quieten down. 
We were very disappointed and feel that this really let the hotel down.
",2,2007,09,12
249,"Out of town, but worth the stay","We stayed for two nights at this 4* hotel on the outskirts of the City of Dublin.  Although this meant travelling in/out it was worth it as the hotel room was excellent and the other facilities were also very good.  Hotel guests have complimentary use of the Sanovitae spa and there are two restaurants to choose from.  Across the road from the hotel there is a private bar/restaurant which is very good (and cheaper than the hotel).  Staff (mainly european) are very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was, overall, clean and tidy.  
Buses run every 10 minutes (although you do have a five minute walk to the bus stop) and cost E1.6 p/p each way into town and take about 15 mins.  A taxi to town cost E20.  
We got a fabulous internet saver rate and paid only £130 for the two of us for 2 nights (weekend).
Recommended!
",4,2007,09,04
249,Good Hotel at a low price,"Nice Hotel with spacious rooms. Have stayed here on a number of occasions when visiting Dublin. 

Staff are helpful and friendly but check-in can be slow.

Restaurant  is nice and leisure center was very good.

Very close to Liffey Valley shopping centre which is always appreciated by my wife. Nice cinema and a number of resteraunts near by.

You can get some great deals for this hotel if you choose the pre-pay internet rate from hotel website. Last time we stayed we got a room-only price of EUR 80 which isn't bad for a 4*.
",4,2007,08,20
249,Quite okay,"Family of five stayed one night - very nice rooms indeed- even nicer swimmingpool - service okay apart from the bartender - though the view isn´t exciting, we had a balcony with lovely morningsun - not the best bargain outside Dublin but a fine place to sleep.
",3,2007,08,13
249,Great Hotel & Facilities,"Just come back from a 2 night stay at Clarion. Nice, comfortable and clean room with leisure facilities on site, which appealed to us.  Brilliant food served in restaurant (Kudos) and prices reasonable.  Staff were quite accommodating too.

Down-side is the fact that you need a car or be prepared to spend a lot of money on taxis!  Bus stop is a REALLY long walk away!  Also walls are way too thin!
",4,2007,08,13
249,Average,"I was then told rooms would not be beside each other or even remotely near each other.

That was fine it wasn't a big deal but it was just when I put request in we would have preferred it.

We had to gove €100 sec deposit per room which I thought was a bit steep.

Rooms were lovely- spacious, clean and comfy beds.

We went out that night and returned back to hotel about 2.30am where we were greeted by 6 bouncers. they were nice enough after we were given an inquizition.

We returned to the room and proceeded to order room service of sandwiches. 10 mins later we had knock on door to tell us we would not be getting room service. We said fine and went to bed, about half an hour later the phine started ringing and the door, we answered and they were standing there with a trolley of food. I said we weren't taking it as we were told we would not be getting room service.

Overall it's quiet average for a 4*, food in restaurant was okish and service alright. Nice rooms and convenient to shopping centre location.
",2,2007,08,08
249,good value for the price,"I just returned from staying 5 nights at this hotel. All in all I feel that the price was right for the services I received. Compared to the overly priced hotels closer to the city center, this was a relief. Even though you must depend on taxis or the bus for transportation it was still cheaper with those expenses than staying at the city center hotels. It was quiet and clean, two musts for me. Room service was prompt and the food was adequate for the price. The creme brule was excellent! Some staff were quite helpful and others seemed kind of preoccupied and indifferent. The location is kind  of in the middle of nowhere, there is a mall across the road however it closed at 7pm every night which due to my jet lag because of coming from the US; I never could seem to get there before it closed. So it would have been better if the mall would have stayed open a bit later but then I am used to US malls which stay open til 9 or 10pm. There are buses for day tours to Wicklow Mountains, Malaheide Castle, Newgrange and some other spots that pick you up at the hotel door for free and take you right to the city center to catch the tour bus. So I found that was quite convenient. It is true that because of there being no air conditioning or fans my room was quite stuffy and hot at times. There was just one small window that could be opened a crack to let some ventilation in. But I was not there much more than to sleep at night so it wasn't much of a problem. Considering the other hotel choices in Dublin, I would probably stay here again.
",3,2007,07,30
249,all around bad experience,"I checked out the Clarion's website before booking and it read ""spectacular views"" and ""where country and city meet.""  These statements are lies.  The view from our room was of a giant mud pit and car dealership.  There is also a mall and busy highway.  How is that the country?  Another lie was that breakfast is included in your stay.  When we were checking out, they charged us $45 for every time we had breakfast.    They boast about the comfortable rooms, when in fact there are no air vents and it is extremely hot.  The bed was so thin I could feel rods prodding my back all night.    Also, getting into the city is a huge hassle and don't expect the staff to help you at all.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
",1,2007,07,26
249,Poor,"Very overpriced. I would expect to pay far less for a hotel as bad as this. This hotel is not the best one to stay at if you don't have your own car. You will end up spending a fortune on taxis. The service in the hotel was ok but the rooms are ugly. There is however a wonderful fish and chip shop across the road where the service is awful but the food is great!
",2,2007,07,18
249,"Wonderful hotel, great location","This hotel was so much fun and it was right near the liffey valley mall.  It's a short walk to the bus stop, where the buses are cheap.(they'll take you for pretty much whatever you can offer them)  Our only problem was trying to get into the pool.  The ours aren't very good, and they have lots of rules.  Overall, we had so much fun and we were traveling with our 12 month old.

249,great time had by all,"just back from a 2 night stay with wife and 2 kids & we all really enjoyed it.staff really friendly especially locals(i think the foriegners cant understand us too well as we talk so fast but when we spoke slower they were fine. our fault .we do tend to rattle on a bit)the pool was great & food in restaraunt was great although the food served in the bar was not for us as we are not into oriental food but  5 mins up road is shopping centre with all the usual fast food outlets that kids love.our little boy really hit it off with the staff in the restaraunt who where great with him ,they even allowed him to help them.many thanks to laura and her boss they  really made a little boy very happy.
 only slight critisim was the bedroom was a little on the small side but that was because we needed an extra single bed in the room for our other kid.(think they usually only hold 3).
all in all really first class hotel and staff really helpful (read some of the reviews and thought we were in for a nightmare trip but everthing went without  any problems)and would definitly stay again

249,"Lovely hotel, location not so good.","Stayed mid March this year, close to Dublin International airport, there was 2 of us, think taxi was about 10Euros each.
Lovely clean, modern, spacious hotel. Room fantastic, great decor, very clean and bathroom very clean also.
Japanese style bar, gorgeous food but wouldnt want to eat there every night, breakfast delicious - great choice, buffet style (hot & cold). Restaurant nice and clean also.
Used the swimming pool free of charge but had to pay about 1Euro for a swimming hat - everyone has to wear one! Swimming pool good also, has a steam room/sauna/jacuzzi etc. Didn't use the gym but looked like it had all the equipment you would expect. 
Only downfall, quite far from centre, coudlnt walk, had to pay about 20-25Euros each way. Couple of bars near hotel which were Ok and hotel just a 10 minute walk from the big shopping centre which also has a cinema.
Staff on reception helpful etc and the hotel has plenty of lifts, plenty of parking spaces etc.

249,Very nice stay,"My partner and I stayed at the Clarion for two nights. Booking in was very swift and efficient. We had the option to leave credit card details so that any ""extras"" would be charged directly to the card. We declined this and it was no problem. We like to pay for things as we go.
The Hotel, even though it is outside the City Centre is very good. The rooms are well furnished and very clean. We did not use the gmn facilities but did go in to have a look. It does boast a very well equipped gym area, sauna, Jacuzzi and large heated pool. It was quite busy when we went in to have a look.
We stayed on a B & B basis. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of things to tempt you. The traditional cooked breakfast was excellent. The staff throughout our stay were very helpful and polite. Checking out was also very quick, we would certainly stay at the Clarion next time we visit Dublin.
We had hired a car but after advice not only from this forum but other people we know who had been to Dublin decided to use the bus in to the City Centre. I am glad we did, the traffic was horrendous!
We had a long day looking at some of the usual visitor attractions. The next day we drove down to Wexford, stopping off at Wicklow on the way back. The scenery was beautiful and the people were most charming and friendly.

249,Great Hotel !!,"My husband and I stayed at this Clarion hotel for three nights nearing the end of May/07. If you want to see the tourist areas in down town Dublin city you will have to drive OR take the city bus. A taxi from the hotel to Trinity College was only about 22euro.The hotel and our guest room was modern and comfortable. The service was fine as well. All in all ,we were pleased with this hotel.
",4,2007,06,19
249,"Got charged twice, crap service but okay rooms","When we arrived, the hotel was nice, our impression changed quick!  We were woken up by screaming children playing football outside our room at 7am, we called the front desk who did nothing about it, we called again at 8:30 as the ball was banging against our door and still nothing.  We called being very upset and were told to come see the manager.  The manager (Rachael) told us there was nothing she could do, she was rude and made us feel bad for complaining.  They would not change our room as they said the hotel was full.  The next day the kids were being loud again, we called down again and were told that someone would come up but no one did.  We asked if we made noise at 3 am what would happen and the manager told us she would kick us out- total double standard.  The last straw was we were charged twice.  We booked the hotel through an web service got charged again through the hotel.  It took 3 weeks for them to refund our money.  The hotel is a distance from the city center.  You will need  a car.  Rooms are okay but service is horrible
",2,2007,06,18
249,rude staff,"Arriving at the hotel we were quite suprised by the location as it seemed to be in some sort of retail park.

Checking in the staff were rude and not at all helpful.

We stayed in one of the suites which was closest to a pub/nightclub that didn't close till after 1 the noise from it wasn't too bad but at chucking out time the people waiting outside for taxi's were extremely noisy.

pubic transport into city centre issimple and easy to use. however the bus stop is about a 10-15min walk away!!!

staff in reception were again rude when ordering taxi's for going out.

when checking out we were told that the hotel could not keep our bags, although they had kept the bags of other guests who were in a larger party,whats the difference???????

overall a clean lovely hotel but staff really let the place down!!!!!

249,Worth the stay.,"Good.

1. Gym/pool facilities are excellent. 
2. Price.  Book online in advance
3. Child friendly
4. Rooms spacious/comfortable 

Bad.

1. Location.  Not central...but close to scenic areas of Dublin.
2. Restaurant/ Bar staff can be a slow.
3. Views from rooms not the greatest.
4. Try not to check in/out at peak times.  Pandemonium.

All in all, probably the best value hotel in Dublin.

249,Wow!!!!!,"We stayed at the clarion Liffey Valley from 26/05 - 28/05 and could not fault a thing. There were 17 ladies in our party, all staying here for my hen weekend! As soon as we could, we went to reception to check in, whilst there, we were told that instead of staying in the hotel we would be staying in the apartment suites. After being given our keys, we managed to locate all the rooms with no problem, mine was the last to be found! 5 of us were left to stay in the last apartment, when we found it we were completely amazed! we walked in to find we had a HUGE penthouse suite with 2 big bedrooms, a massive living area, kitchen, dining room, laundry room, office and 2 bathrooms!!! we were amazed at how beautiful this place was, we even had a balcony AND roof garden - what a wonderful surprise! The hotel had upgraded us as we were such a big party and felt we could use the extra space! we could not say a bad word about this hotel at all. the only problem we had during our stay was the cost of taxis to and from the hotel! this was minor, as the hotel was awesome! when checking out, i asked the receptionist how much we should have paid per night for the penthouse suite - she said it should have been 300 euro per night. we only paid 95 euro!! fantastic! we will definitley be going back again!
",5,2007,06,07
249,Good Location,"Stayed here in April 2007 with wife and 2 yr old son. Very handy location for nearby shopping, night stay before going to airport or if you want an out of town Dublin hotel. Barfood was good, as was breakfast.

We left an item behind us in our hotel room and hotel staff kindly posted this onto us.

Would recommend for the above reasons and no doubt will be back again.

249,Good impression,"Modern hotel but you need a car to go to the city centre. Public Bus  78A is 500 meter walk, cost 1.9 €d; trip is about 50 minutes with normal traffic. Room normal size and bathroom ok but NO HAIRDRYER. ( spouse in panic.......) Comfortable large bed, not to much noise surrounding. Free car park. We didnt eat in restaurant but Bar is OK and prices also. 3 nights prepaid but receptionist charges 100 € in advance for expences. Breakfast is OK: sufficient choice. Staff was helpfull in all ways. Notice that on saturday carpark is crowded because the gym and swimmingpool clients. but you can park on a overflow parking on the opposite side of the road. We booked via website late.bookings and paid 80 € night for the room to pay in advance and no refund. You can not have cheaper because B&B charges pro person at least 35 a 45! If you have a car and obtain a good price we recommend  this hotel. 8/10 points

249,Fantastic Trip!!!,"Just arrived home after a 4 day break to Dublin and have to say that this hotel was the best I have ever stayed in. Prior to arriving I emailed the hotel to ask for information about how to travel to the hotel from the city centre by a bus. I received a very quick and detailed response which made travelling significantly easier when we arrived. The check in was fast and efficient and we were even offerred a choice of rooms. We would definately recommend the use of the pool and other spa facilties as they were fantastic. The hotel lived up to all our expectations - and even exceeded them in some instances! Although I had read reviews complaining about the lack of English spoken by members of staff, we didn't have this problem. The only  issue we had with the hotel was the price of the food - but you get that in all hotels. For a good, reasonably priced meal we would recommend the Steakhouse in the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre (the Steakhouse is located beside the cinema and Pizza Hut). Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definately stay here again!

249,Fawlty Towers Irish Style!!!,"I previously wrote here of my experience in this hotel back in April, and at the invitation of the manager, I returned to the hotel on Friday May 11th, and turned into reception for 10.30am...

Initially I was told at reception that the room was not ready and that it was €200.00 but I explained my booking was for €190.00 and she did then check it and without apologising, said €190.00 and then printed out what I already had in my hand.

She then said my room was ready and could go up straight away which I did and found myself in an executive suite which was the hotel way of apologising for cock-up in April.

I met with hotel manager who was reassuring that all would be well and I took him at his word but by God was I to regret it later that evening.

I attempted to order food 3 times from the room phone and each time on 2 seperate occassions, my calls rng out and then returned to reception. I went downstairs to find out what was going on and got no help whatsoever at reception and found the Duty Manager a little more than arrogant and of no help whatsoever.

In the restaurant which was not all that busy to be frank, the Manager there was of the same calibre as the Receptionist Manager so I was not intent on flogging a dead horse and went back to reception to ask the question as to why the calls were ringing out and why the receptionist known as 'Big Chris' had not taken the order and sent it to the kitchen at least.

I was met by a wall of silence and no help whatsoever!!!

I went to the off-licence nearby and bought in my dinner of crisps maltesers and Guinness (considering I had last eaten only a breakfast that morning) and settled in for the night and felt that I was not wishing to stay the following day and rang a few other hotels to see what availoability there was for a Saturday night.

The following morning, I was met by Anne, who explained to me that there is a problem internally with room service telephone service which was known by ALL staff and should have been explained to me the night before. I said that as a guest in the hotel I should not have to think about such a thing and that I had received no help whatsoever despite the reassurances of the overall Manager was unacceptable.

She did not disagree and I advised her that I was trying to find another hotel to stay in as I had a colleague due to stay with me that night and could not have this issue happen again and I received her word it would not. 

As I was going out the door she asked if I had breakfast and I said that rather than risk being left without it in the hotel I would go to the nearby shopping centre and guarantee it for myself.

That evening, my colleague arrived, and despite it being noted at reception, no other extra linen etc was int he room so I had to order it from the reception which was delivered.

However, my colleague decided to order food at 8pm and thankfully he managed to get through to Room Service and placed his order. At 8.40pm his food had not arrived to the room so I went to reception and enquired after its whereabouts only to be met yet again by the same said manager from the night before so I went straight to the restauraunt manager who could not offer any reason why almost an hour later the food had not been delivered.

At this point, the duty manager came in and I asked him not to get involved as this was a matter for the restauraunt and not reception which had not proven itself to be helpful the night before. He insisted on sticking his oar in despite my repeated requests from him not to so do and again he was not being at all helpful to resolve the situation...just stood there looking and listening but not actually doing anything to assist in the matter.

I returned to reception and asked to speak with a manager or at least contact be made with one as I felt that 2 nights in a row was just 2 nights too much. My request was met by tears from a receptionist who was less than 6 months in the job (this was her 1st ever position in a hotel!!) so I turned elsewhere and despite much protestation and obfusication by the reception staff, a manager was located and contacted me nearly an hour later!!!

She was most apologetic and tried to convince me that it was not acceptable and if we required food it could be organised but at this point the maltesers and crisps were now depleted...a bit late considering the time passed from ordering  to time of her call and actively looking to get another hotel.

As the night passed, I decided to have some tea and found there were no teabags or enough milk or sugar so went to reception to order them and spoke to the duty manager there (YES him!!!) and was very exact in what I was looking for so as to ensure there was no misunderstanding...tea, milk and sugar....

Within 5 minutes, I received a plastic bag that contained sugar and 2 different types of coffee...no milk and no teabags...!!!

I returned to reception and yep HE was there so I clarified with him what we understood what I had asked for and we were in unison on it...tea, milk and sugar...and when I emptied the bag on to the desk he knew it was not good...for either him or me...

Again, no offer to explain or apologise for how this very simple request could have been so screwed up...and the word of assurance of 3 managers down the toilet with it all...I returned to my room none the better for what should have been a weekend break and the following morning, I made the decision never ever to return to this 'hotel'

Despite the attempts of persuasion, the attempt to explain the inexplicable (and this was acknowledged by Rachel) there was nothing further that could be said or done which could justify the staff and their lack of assistance and courtesy. 

I was let down by the Management who were let down by the staff is how it was resolved but I am never going to recommend this Fawlty Towers 'hotel' to anyone as it would be wrong of me to do so considering my experience.

I only take someone's word once and 3 people gave me their word but to no avail...I have even cancelled my stay there for August...

I cannot and will not recommend this hotel to anyone who truly wants to relax and enjoy its 'services' and mine were most simple...food...and if that cannot be (literally) delivered then what is the point?

249,Plesant stay,"I stayed here with a friend for a city break.
We arrived at the hotel from Dublin airport at midnight on Friday night. A taxi cost us 30Euros and took about 25mins.
We were dealt with quickly and given our room card. The room was inviting. Trendy and welcoming. 
We ordered room service for breakfast as we hadn't chose breakfast at booking. It will cost you 20Euros each for a top wack brakfast inc a fry up, tea/coffee and cereal, yougurts and fruit if you stomach it!!
We headed into the city. The buses are regular except you have to walk around the hotel to get to the stop. Make sure you ask before you leave. It will cost you 1.60 Euros one way on bus and will take about 10-15mins. 
We did a bus tour with the hop on, hop off option. This cost us 15Euros each and we did the jail on this tour and Grafton street then had a drink in the Clarence hotel in eve (U2s Bar).
On the return journey ask the driver if he will go near the Liffey shopping centre. When you see the Marks and Spencers mega store. This is the Liffey shopping centre. The bus will drop you off on what seems to be the motorway but it is easy to cross over the roads to the hotel. We actually took a short cut which many people did by walking up the bank instead of walking all way around the grounds. 
We stayed in the bar for a drink. Very busy and never ate the food but looked lovely and other people seemed pleased.
Caters well for children.
On the Sunday we were going to head out to Witlow on the train jouney to see where they filmed ""Ballykissangle"" which goes straight from hotel but this does not run on Sundays (typical!). We went back into the city and did the Guiness Factory.
I used the spa facilities. 
You need a hat to swim in the pool. The changing room are modern and safe.
We visited the Liffey Shopping centre on Mon. It was very busy. We went to the cinema but beware of the roads. They are very dangerous. Try to find a crossing!!
We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but there is a place next door which you can get a full breakfast from 6 euros and serve till 12noon. 
Very pleasant stay. Would def stay there again. 
The only downside we found was the lack of info at check in and in room. Not much on local interests and no info on breakfast options. You can find a loads of leaflets at recption though on local interest.

249,Great Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March. The prices were very reasonible and the room was very spacious. There was both a double and a single bed in the room. The style is very modern but it's clean and very comfortable. 

The hotel has two restaurants. One serving Asian food which is very reasonable and the service is quick too. The other restaurant is a bit more expensive but serves good food also. I'd reccommend the Asian though. 

The hotel is a good bit outside the city. It's okay if you have a car. Otherwise a taxi is really the only option. There is an excellent shopping centre only across the road though.

The only bad thing I can say about this hotel was that I was in a connecting room which was a bit noisy. I could hear everything in the next room and was woken up at 6 am on my last morning there by a child crying. However, I complained to the hotel manager and he was very helpful and offered me compensation for my trouble. I believe they have rooms that aren't connecting to another room so I would reccommend asking for one of those.

I would definetly go back to this hotel because despite my one bad experience overall it was very comfortable and reasonable.

249,Real Nice Place,"Stayed here for two nights on business.  The hotel is relatively new and very modern.  The room and bathroom was spacious with very modern decor.  Very confortable indeed.  I found the food in the restaurant to be very expensive.  However, the oriental food in the bar off reception was fantastic and terrific value.  The leisure centre is also very modern with great pool and steam/sauna.  A really nice hotel.  The only downside is having to allow 60 minutes to travel into Dublin due to the traffic on the M4 and M50.  A real nice place.

",4,2007,04,29
249,A little bit of luxury,"I've stayed in this hotel several times on weekend visits to Dublin.  The hotel is several miles outside of the City Centre which would be a negative point for those without transport but as I was driving, it wasn't an issue.
The hotel itself is very modern  & aesthetically pleasing and the rooms were out of this world - spacious, luxurious and very clean.  Although we didn't eat in the restaurant we did have room service and found the food to be good value and delicious.  I would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly although as I mentioned previously, the location might be a problem for those who are not driving as there didn't appear to be any public transport that travelled directly by.
There is also the advantage of the huge Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, just 5 mins walk away, which is home to hundreds of shops, cafes and fast food restaurants as well as a cinema.

249,horrible experience,"We had a  reservation to stay at the Clarion River Liffy
in March 2007 confirmed by credit card..I had paid a room deposit online of 17 Euros, which had  already been billed to my credit card. When we arrived at 6:00 p.m. , they had overbooked and there was no room for us and we had to go to another hotel  very far away,very inconvenient. Do not trust a reservation at this
hotel .

249,amazing!!,"i stayed at the clarion hotel liffey valley for a hen weekend in march. the rooms were clean, big and very up to date!. the bathroom was clean and spacious.

there are two restaurants located in the hotel premises, one of which is a thai restaurant and can found at the residents bar. the only problem with the restaurants was that there was no simple meals such as burgers and chips! Alcohol was expensive but that goes without saying as Dublin is 1 of the most expensive cities for drinking. there is a shopping centre and cinema about 15 mins walk away this is a great day out. 

taxi costs about 25euro to get into the city centre but the hotel and surrounding area have more than enough to choose from.

the hotel has a leisure facility that can be used free of charge for guests at the hotel, this is a great way to relax - only embarrasing thing is that swim caps are compulsury in the south of ireland! All room shave mini bar with soft drinks and crisps in them - this is a bit pricey!. Room service is cheap and great for midnight snack after being out drinking - i recommend the cheese board and grapes, this was 8.90 euro for a full try of cheese, crackers and grapes!.

I would def stay in this hotel again - rooms great for the price!

249,"Very Friendly Bar Staff, Excellent Food","Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband and teenage son and we had a fantastic time. The food in the restaurant was very nice and the room service meals were really good too. The bar staff made us very welcome and were really good with my 16 year old son.

The room was lovely, very clean, large and modern.

The hotel is quite a long way from Dublin Centre so beware which bus you catch. One of them takes about 40 mins and goes through a pretty bad housing estate. The other only takes about 15mins, but it is quite a walk to the bus stop.

There is a shopping centre nearby which was quiet and has some nice shop, but nothing different to the usual English shopping Centres.

There is also an off licence very close by which will save on the bar bill, but is easy to miss.

The taxi drivers were fab and kept us well entertained.

All in all we spent a fortune on our ""cheap"" trip to Dublin, but we were there to have a good time, and the hotel certainly added to the pleasure!

249,Excellent value,"We have just returned from a three night stay in this hotel. I booked this hotel on the strength of previous reviews and found them to be accurate. The hotel is modern and the rooms were very well appointed. The quality of accommodation is well above average for the price you pay. We found the staff to be very pleasant and concierge very obliging.

We never ate in the restaurant or bar (this was too busy) but there are plenty places to eat nearby.

Our stay was spoilt only by noisy guests who were attending a conference/anniversary over the same weekend. Every 20 mins or so between midnight and 4am, both nights, a group of people would loudly make their way to their rooms ( not great with 3 young children ) however difficult to complain about something like that when it's kind of one of those things you have to expect in a large hotel over a weekend.

 If I was visiting Dublin with my husband only , I would choose to stay more centrally . However I'd highly recommend this hotel especially if you are travelling with children. All in all, excellent.

249,Great for a shopping weekend,"Stayed at the Clarion Hotel in Feb 07 for two nights.   The hotel is extremely clean and very centrally located, with a lovely shopping centre directly across the road (fantasic for weekend shoppers). 

The hotel has a reasonably good bar menu but not to everyones taste as there is not a lot of choice in food types, they mainly serve Asian food and only have a limited snacks and sandwiches should you not require something spicy. 

Breakfast was not included in our stay and in my opinion was overpriced.   It would have cost €20 per person plus a €5 delivery charge to have breakfast delivered to the room, thats a total of €50 for breakfast.   Outreagous if you ask me.    We did not eat in the restaurant as we found a great bar/restaurant across the road from the hotel as the menu in the restaurant did not look that exciting to be honest. 

I can not comment on the leisure facilites as i did not use them but the pool did look lovely. 

All in all a very clean and modern hotel.

249,"Great rooms, but rude staff","Just returned from a 2 night stay at the clarion in liffey valley and have mixed feelings as i write this review. While the hotel is indeed comfortable and clean with access to great shopping facilities, the service really does leave a lot to be desired. The main problem i experienced was that i effectively had to book 3 times. I had initially booked on a hotel website and sent an email to the clarion asking for confirmation and accomodations 4 days before my arrival. As i did not receive any confirmation from the hotel, i decided to ring them. They had no booking at that time but rang me back an hour later to say that it had been sent through email but that they had not realised. Although the girl i had with spoken to was extremely apologetic, the accomodations i had asked for obviously went over her head as when i arrived the girl at reception proceeded to ask me what type of room i was looking for!! i consider myself a very patient person but this did annoy me, that coupled with the fact that it was 11.30 at night only added to my frustration.

The one thing i will say about the clarion is that rooms are spotless, spacious and extremely comfortable for the price you pay. Breakfast is also a delight. Unfortunately, from the moment you arrive at the clarion you are not made feel welcome. The staff are abrupt, rude and unwelcoming, especially in the restaurant in the evening. I think this was the first time i haven't left a tip for dinner in over  3 years and i had good reason; the manager was gruff, the set dinnner menu WELL below average and our waitress had a serious attitude problem. When i requested a specific table on our arrival the manager proceeded to usher us to a corner at the back telling me that other table had been reserved. It turned out that it had been kept for non-resident guests who had not booked. I think it had something to do with the fact that i had booked a discounted 2 night B+B plus dinner break, as this was eluded to when we arrived. 

Apart from the generally rude staff, our break was ok but to be honest i wouldn't return.

249,Excellent Hotel 4*,"I stayed in the Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley in Jan 07 for 2 days, my stay there was perfect there was a massive shopping centre just up the road it was a 5-10min walk you could see this from the back of the hotel. The centre of Dublin and Temple Bar was a taxi ride away which cost ruffley 25 euros, and there was thousdands of taxi's available.

The hotel facilitys were excellent the swimming pool & gym is available till 10pm every night and free to hotel guest, the hotel food was excellent especially the breakfast, as this was included in the hotel price and the range of foods available in the morning were excellent to suit all.

I would rate this hotel 4*, and will be returning to the hotel in May 07.

249,"Modern, sleek, & clean!!","We found Clarion Hotel Liffey to be exactly as expected.  It was ultra modern, incredibly clean, and very accomadating.  It is located a good 20-25 minutes from downtown dublin, but, the bus stop wasn't far from the hotel.  In cold weather, the stop is a bit of a hike, so, we parked our rental car in the nearby mall parking lot, and only had to walk across the street.  The nearby mall was a nice place to spend some down-time, and had a large variety of stores, as well as an ample food-court, which was great for an inexpensive breakfast in the mornings.  The only complaint I have regarding the hotel is the temp. control on the bathroom shower, it never stayed consistent.  Aside from that, it was a very pleasant hotel, making our 1st trip to Ireland very enjoyable!!!

249,excellent,"Have stayed in a few Clarion properties.  Stayed on a weekend break as a couple.   There was a mix of couples and families staying at the hotel and any children present were well under control.  Good security at the leisure facilities which were lovely.  Keypad code to gain access to changing rooms which have also family changing cubicles.  The hotel is exceptionally clean with good quality bedding etc. There was a good variety at breakfast time and enjoyed 2 lovely dinners.   Dublin City Centre is very accessible for 1.60 euro from a bus stop located close to the hotel (no: 25a or 66 bus).  Shane, the hotel concierge is knowledgeable and helpful.  After checking into our room we went to the nearby Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and spent a couple of hrs there (vue cinema also.  Returned to our hotel room to find a Chinese gentleman in it who has been double booked into our room.  Duty Manager was very apologetic.  This hotel is excellent.  Very high standards for a reasonable price.  Excellent value.  Returning with my children soon.

249,Clarion is great,"Stayed in Clarion over the Christmas rush to get some shoppnig done whilst taking a break.  The hotel is new and is spotless throughout.  The staff were not the best while I was there but they were serously not the worst.  Got a great room away from the noise of the club and the road.  The club by the way does not really keep you awake at all, unless you begin thinking about it and noticing it too much which some other light sleeping reviewers seem to have.  Cannot comment on the restaurant.  It is in a suburban area of Dublin with a large shopping centrea nd village in the vicinity and a lovely chinese restaurant called lemongrass across the road, food is slightly expensive but quality dining.  Really enjoyed staying here would recommend to a friend.

249,never again,"Ok I booked this hotel on ratestogo.com using my credit card as a deposit. After xmas my credit card was to the limit so I was planning to pay in cash. Never ever aproblem before.
However the clarion dont like people with no credit  card to use
i had to pay the balance of the room AND leave a 100 euro deposit at the front desk., How insultin is this!

Room was tiny and had cracks in the wall. The Tv movies didnt work and reception would not rectify as i hadnt left credit card!
The heat was unreal and i had to trow off blankets(in january)

The noise level was unreal i got apx 2 hours sleep all night.

This hotel likes to think its a classy place but its just the pizza hut of restauarants. Oh yeah and breakfast is 20 euro!!!

249,"Nice rooms, not so nice staff","Me and two girlfriends stayed here in Nov as it was quite cheap on the website and I knew it was newly open.

The room was lovely, we had a double and a single and it was very nicely decorated in a kind of urban style.  I loved the bathroom, very stylish and slick.

We had breakfast the next morning which was over priced and not great.

The staff let this hotel down.  We needed a number of a food place so we could order in and the man on reception was very rude.  He was trying to stop some man from bringing friends back to his room and was literally shouting at him while I stood there.  It was very unprofessional and I was embarassed! They were rude at check in and very rude when we checked out aswell, I wouldn't stay here again because of the staff.  It's such a pity as it is a very nice hotel otherwise.

1st Jan-5th Jan 2007
Just returned home from a new year break in Clarion Liffy Valley.
Had a lovely time. Hotel is great. Rooms spotless. Lovely christmas tree in foyer. We had a 8 year old grand daughter with us and she loved the lovely leisure centre. The hotel is just walking distance from large shopping center. We enjoyed the sales even thought they were very busy as the children were on school holidays. Food at the hotel was good but there was a lot of people having breakfast at one time as a result there was a delay on first morning getting tea and toast. On the next morning the bar was set up for the over flow and things were much smoother. Congratulations again to house keeping staff as rooms were top class. We highly recomend this hotel. Lovely place to stay.

249,Exceded our Expectations!,"We arrived at Belfast airport earlier in the day after a long flight from Canada. We drove our rental car to Dublin and had no trouble locating the hotel as it is located on the Ring Route of Dublin. Our only problem was that we had printed off the driving instructions from Expedia site and they are not ""too accurate.""  Lots of free parking available at the hotel both above ground and under ground. Check in was very slick and smooth as we had reserved through the Clarion 's own web site. (Got a better price $$$ than what was on Expedia.ca or Hotels.ca) Without asking, we were automaticaly told we were being upgraded. We asked for a quite room as we needed a nap badly! They gave us a room at the far end of the hall on the top floor. It was a longer walk to the elevator but very quite as no one needed to pass our room to get anywhere. The room was nicely appointed, comfortable bed made up of two twins hooked together but sheeted as one big bed or king size as we have at home! We found the room and bath very clean and although the styling was very ""Euro"", it was very comfortable, colourful and cosy. Thoughtful things, like wine glasses on the tea making tray. The tea making tray had hot chocolate and cookies as well as tea, coffee (both regular and decaf.) The shopping Mall was a 5 minute walk away and we had a great late supper there. Several mid range restaurants as we as McDonald's and other fast foods. Dinner for two at the restaurant cost $25.00 CAD. Marks and Spencer store sells bottles of wine so the wine glasses came in handy. Danish from Marks and Spencer went well with our morning coffee in the room. We also found a book store in the Mall where we were able to purchase a very detailed map book of Ireland as we were here to holiday for one full month in Ireland. We enjoyed another breakfast coffee at Starbucks in the Mall the next morning ( 2 cups of American coffee $8.00 CAD so enjoy the complementry ones in the room!) before we departed to stay for 3 nights at the Radisson Hotel St. .Helen's in south Dublin. We didn't use the hotel leisure facilities but can comment that they looked good. Over all a great place to stay on your first night in Ireland. Highlandsally & Raggy Tartan

249,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel was the best of the 3 hotels i stayed in over the Christmas period.  Beautiful hotel, lovely reception area, gorgeous rooms and the staff very friendly and willing to help with any queries. 

Great bar opposite the hotel which has a late bar at weekends.  Location for me is perfect.  Buses and taxis to the city centre are plentiful although if you plan on getting back to the hotel from city centre at weekends after a night out be prepared to stand on a taxi rank for at least an hour.  

Clarion, Liffey Valley = A++++
",5,2007,01,02
249,Very cosy & lovely,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley which I booked at a great price through expedia. 

What can I say - although it is a little out of the centre the hotel is gorgeous. The bus routes are quick and easy - taxi drivers are friendly and are mtered so they can't rip you off. The shopping is amazing. 

Staff in the hotel were very helpful - we had a problem where the heater wouldn't work and they fixed the radiator within 2 hours. The hotel bar is OK but it was full of children which I was not so keen on. 

the spa facilites were really good - the pool was clean and the steam room, jacuzzi and sauna very hot! 

I am definately going back in the new year!

249,Lovely Hotel...great location for shopping!!,"We stayed in the Clarion Liffey Valley for the weekend at the end of October.  We had booked it through the hotel directly at €120 B&B per night for a double room.  We have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions, due to its good transport links (near to the motorway), beside the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and the hotel is modern and clean as well as giving reasonable rates.  

The previous few times we stayed here, we noticed that it was very busy with a lot of children running about the foyer area until late on.  They ask that children be out of the bar area by 9pm, which is fine. Check in is always slow no matter what time you check in, even with the 3 receptions going.  The reception staff were always very pleasant and helpful on each of our visits and they did try to do their best to accommodate any requests we had.  This particular visit, as the hotel was pretty much fully booked and I had asked for a non smoking room, they put us in the newly built apartments adjoining onto the hotel for the same price!!  What can I say, they were excellent!  Entrance hallway leading off to; a bathroom with shower & bath, a wet room with washing machine/tumble dryer, a bedroom and a living Room/Kitchen.  Top class décor I must say and I would be very fussy when it comes to interiors.  Massive beds, everything you could want in a kitchen, microwave, dishwasher, minibar (stocked) as well as fridge!  Home away from home.  Not that we used the kitchen, except to make a cup of tea, we had our breakfast delivered to the room and ate in the Thai restaurant next door, highly recommend it!  We had to book the restaurant early.  We had ate in the main hotel restaurant the first time we stayed at the hotel, but found it very busy and noisy, great if you have kids, as they are very child friendly!  This time we went to the bar next door to the Thai restaurant, very trendy and good atmosphere.  Finished the weekend off with a day’s shopping in the Liffey Valley (5 mins walk away), sure what more could a girl want!

We didn’t use the leisure facilities, but they looked great!  Will definitely bring the swimming cozi the next time!  Overall lovely hotel in my opinion, try and get the apartments for comfort, even though the hotel rooms are decorated in the same tasteful décor.

249,Great hotel,"The hotel was modern and clean, with fantastic spa facilities. The room was very clean and spacious and we did not have a single complaint. The hotel is a few miles from dublin city centre but the buses were regular.Make sure you do not get the 78 bus as it takes along time, however as all the people were very friendly, and one night when we had to get the bus, the bus driver dropped us off outside the hotel! Get the 25a, 68 buses from over the footbridge for a much quicker and nicer journey. The Liffey valley shopping complex is handy but not worth spending a day when you are so close to the city centre.
The only complaint was spending 16 euros on a buffet breakfast. The toast was cold and hard and the rest of the breakfast was not great for that price, but it is easy to find other options.
The hotel was fantastic for the price, and we were totally satisfied with our stay and are planning to return again soon.
",5,2006,11,19
249,Lived up to its own web site claims!,"After trying in vain to find a Dublin city centre hotel with reasonable reviews, we decided to stay outside the city and hire a car, although there are bus links into Dublin.
Our triple superior room was spacious, very clean & well furnished.  (e.g hair dryer, iron, good sized TV) Storage space & mirrors particularly good. Mini bar not stocked, although you could request this, but handy for keeping own drinks, etc
Tea & coffee provided.
Bathroom was also clean and spacious. Bed linen and towels really good quality, toiletries nice too. (With the ban on liquids in hand luggage in planes from UK, very welcome -shower gel, shampoo & body lotion)
We hadn't booked the hotel for the view, we overlooked the dual carriageway into Dublin, but noise was not a problem.
Modern shopping centre nearby, 15 mins walk.
Breakfast seemed a bit pricey, but the continental buffet at €11.50 was copious with good choice of cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt etc. The full Irish at €16 also looked enormous!
Hotel staff were of various nationalities, but all polite & helpful.
We were told that parking was difficult in Dublin, we didn't have a problem finding car parks, but they were expensive and the traffic was very heavy at times. On average, it took 20 -30 mins to drive into the centre.
Wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again. 
For anyone who's stayed at the Hilton, Blackpool UK, I'd say the overall qualitry was the same!
",5,2006,10,31
249,"Great if you want to party, not so great if you want peace","I chose the Clarion because I have stayed at other Clarions and really liked them, especially the peaceful Dublin IFSC. In fact, I was a bit of an idiot and accidentally booked this one thinking it was the IFSC. Ah well, I thought, might as well give it a try.

If you are up for a wild night out and like the buzz of a lively hotel with lots of people, stay here. If you prefer peaceful hotels, it might not be for you. The hotel is set inside a complex of restaurants and bars and whilst the hotel itself isn’t noisy (apart from doors that slam shut and walls that are thin), the complex is and it was party time until about 3am – you can’t escape the noise of local bars, so bring your earplugs! The room was very warm and I couldn’t see a thermostat, and the windows only open about 5cm.

We arrived at 10pm and were only staying one night anyway. Sadly there was nowhere opened that served food at hour, including the hotel’s restaurant, so we opted for room service. They mixed our food up a bit (I am a veggie and ordered a chase sandwich, but got a cheese and meat one) but problems were soon rectified and staff were helpful.

The only remember of staff who was quite curt was the girl on the reception desk, who checked us in. She was a bit sour-faced, to be honest, and would probably be more suited to a non customer-facing role.

Breakfast was nice, but this is a busy hotel and so many staff were being asked ‘where’s this?’ ‘where’s that?’ by customers eager to find plates, etc that ran out quickly.

For me, the highlight was the excellent Sanovitae spa/swimming facilities. This is what I love about Clarions, and I made sure I arrived at 8am to take full advantage of the pool and peace while my husband dozed in bed. The lady working there was really helpful and I had a luxurious time of it, swimming, sauna, steam, jacuzzi and more swimming – lovely!!  
 
It's important to know that this hotel is not in Dublin centre. Therefore, it's handy if you just want a pitstop before you head elsewhere in Ireland (as we were), whilst it's not really practical if you fancy a night close to town.
",3,2006,10,14
249,Unbelievably Bad..,"I’ve stayed in many hotels over the years through work and for leisure breaks but thankfully none quite like the clarion Liffey Valley - it was truly shocking!
The hotel building itself is nice, modern and rooms are fairly nice.
However - if they went round every hotel in the country recruiting the worst staff they could find they couldn’t have done a better job.
- Every member of staff I came across was either rude, unhelpful or both!
All appeared to have received no training whatsoever and none know what customer service is.

We were moved from our first room because of a very noisy guest next door (obviously not the hotels fault – but the rooms had locked adjoining doors inside to the next room so it was no surprise it was noisy!) 
The second room we moved to was even noisier as it had a broken window which didn’t close properly and the motorway noise was terrible (noise from road isn’t a problem when window actually shuts) - on returning to reception staff were rude to my girlfriend and asked if the window was broken when we got there!!! 
3rd room was smoking room despite requesting non smoking room and smelled terrible – by that time we were so fed up we made do with it.

The restaurant is a complete joke – breakfast is a free for all – but if you want greasy fired food, rock hard cold toast, and having to find your own table, and ask staff for cutlery, cups, milk, butter etc then it’s the place to go 
As for dinner, if you value your sanity don’t do it! – we waited 10 minutes to be seated in a virtually empty restaurant (despite having booked) and because we stayed in the hotel on a 2 B&B and 1 evening meal deal we had the pleasure of being treated like 2nd class citizens by being handed a scrappy, dirty piece of photocopied paper stuck over the top of a regular menu to order from.
The choice was limited, the food was disgusting at best, and because we were on their “special menu” we weren’t even offered tea or coffee – and we were lucky – the couple beside us waited 30 mins without having their order taken, - they didn’t even get drinks – and this was when the restaurant was empty – so if that sound appealing the clarion dining experience is for you!!

Overall the hotel was hopeless (mainly due to the staff rather than the hotel itself) – it’s only plus point was the leisure centre – it’s was lovely, spotlessly clean and staff were friendly – perhaps the rest of the hotel staff show pay it a visit to see how to treat guests!
Unless you want to stay in a lifeless hotel with a view of a motorway, where you get treated like dirt, moved out of the hotel bar at 12.15 at night so they can Hoover the floors and fight for your breakfast I suggest you try else where!
If they sort their staff out this hotel could be great – as it is, a 4 star this hotel its most defiantly is not

249,"No complaints, but a Little too far from the Action","I would echo most of the other feedback. The hotel is clean, efficient, and well appointed. We did not eat there, we wanted to enjoy the restaurants in the town centre.
If you can afford it, I would suggest you get taxi's to and from the Hotel. The buses are not that frequent, and it is a pain to walk to the one near the main dual carriageway (around the back of the Hotel) and the bus stop facing the front of the Hotel is also a fairly long walk, and takes you through less enviable housing estates. So both are not very convenient.
The swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room were all spotless.
Ideal for people staying on business. A little too far from the action for night owls.

249,Not for the faint hearted,"This is a large clean hotel, easy to find as its only a short drive from the airport, it has ample parking both open air and underground. Upon arrival we were told sorry the hotel is overbooked but we have upgraded you to our new suites, these are large comfortable apartments set apart from the main hotel. BUT this hotel is not for the faint hearted the underground carpark has a tight twisty low hung entrance with obvious signs of collisions by vehicles entering and it floods when it rains. The outdoor carpark had several bare electrical wires sticking up out of the ground, glad we didnt have children with us.The suites boiler packed up so No Hot Water ,we couldnt wash in the bowl of fruit sent by staff as an apology,  and the Night Club Next Door Kept Me Awake To 3.15am.The Restaurant was clean and friendly but the food was bland and uninspired.So unless you drive a mini, have no taste buds and are stone death , try somewhere else.

249,A lovely hotel,"We stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley for a long weekend, my partner and I and our two children.
We arrived earlier than the check in time and although our room was not ready, they allowed us to check in and gave us a room that was ready. It was a lovely large room and easily accomodated a double bed, a single bed and a travel cot (which they supplied). The hotel was spotlessly clean, both the bedrooms and the communal areas. Staff were pleasant and gave advice on the area, booked us taxis and also let us leave our cases between the time we checked out and our flight home. It is a very large hotel and there was plenty of communal places to sit and relax in the foyer. Daily papers always available and also literature and leaflets on activites and surruonding area.
The swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi etc. was clean and not busy - the only slight criticism was that we had to buy swimming caps (at 2.50 euro each) before we were allowed in. Kids were welcome in the pool and there was a childrens pool too.
There was a lovely bar on site and also a restaurant (which we thought was a little on the expensive side - 16 euro for breakfast!). 
Over the road is a lovely pub and restaurant (the ARC) which allows kids downstairs and serves food till 10pm. Also a oriental restaurant (Lemongrass)
Nearby (5-10 minute walk) is a huge shopping centre with lost of the big chain shops and also a big food hall (we ate breakfast there - 5.25 euro!). There are buses available from there (67 & 25a) to Dublin city centre - 1.55 euro and takes about 30 mins. (Avoid the 78 bus, we used it twice and both times there was hassle on the bus from other passengers!)
We had a great time and would use this hotel again, although it is not central to Dublin, it is accessible lots of facilities.

249,nice hotel -long way from city,"This is a nice hotel  - room decor is lovely -nice and spacious - ensuite was fine - plenty of hot water, etc. Service okay - not brilliant.  I was expecting to at least be asked if I enjoyed my stay, etc on leaving - no they just wanted the money... zero personality at reception!  It is right next door to liffey valley shopping centre which is good if that's what you want. If you want to go into the city then I suggest look for somewhere else - it is a good distance out and not on the luas line.  We were driving and ended up lost several times - once ending up in Ballymun and another day in Ballyfermot - not the most desirable locations I can tell you!
",3,2006,08,21
249,Great value for money,"I stayed at this hotel with my wife and son for 3 nights mid August 2006. We were greeted well at reception and dealt with really efficiently. Our room was excellent, well equipped, with all new everything! We ate in the Kudos bar 2 nights ( Asian food) and it was superb, nice welcoming attentive staff and very good service. Good value.On  our last night we ate at the Lemongrass restaurant next door, an average (Asian again!) slightly overpriced experience. The pool is lovely and on our two swims not crowded. (Everyone though, including bald people, need to wear a swim hat, charged at 2.50 euros. Bring your own if you have one.) The hotel is out of central Dublin, hence parking is free, easy, and security patrolled at night. We used the 25a bus for 3 days at 1.55euros, per person each way. The stop is approx 10 mins walk from the hotel, and service frequent. Dublin is easy to see on foot, the Guiness storehouse is a must. The only gripe about this hotel was that our room was hot, - no air con, and a limited opening window, but the weather in Dublin for most of the year should not cause you this problem! We booked the room at £54 per night via Expedia (for 3 persons) - an absolute steal! Ace value for money, highly recommended hotel.
",5,2006,08,15
249,Nice Hotel,"Nice Hotel a little way out of the city.  On the plus side - clean and tidy rooms, great food in the Asian styled restaurant and friendly staff.  On the negative side - no aircon in the room, so I had to have the window open - so disturbed by the traffic noise and the ever present police helicopter (although this may have been a one-off).  All-in-all, a nice hotel for the price.

249,Robbie Williams Weekend,"4 of us stayed at the Clarion Liffey Valley over the weekend when we came over from the UK to see Robbie Williams play at Croke Park.  The hotel is a way out of the City Centre, so you need to be prepared for delays if you are planning on spending plenty of time visiting the usual tourist sites.  The hotel was fully booked for the whole weekend as Robbie Williams, The Eagles and Guns & Roses were all playing in Dublin during the 3 days we visited.  Most of the staff we met, with the exception of the Concierge and a couple of the waitresses were Polish and at times were under a good deal of language pressure from a demanding public.  On the whole, the service was average - the exception being the Concierge who deserved Gold Stars for going out of his way to get us transport down to Croke Park and being very pro-active about our return trip to the Airport.  Both times he  advised and booked us reliable journeys and was full of useful and welcome advise.  Long Queues to check in and check out with only 1 person on reception was'nt really acceptable for such a busy weekend but on the whole, the service should be classed as 'OK'.  The hotel has no air conditioning and over the weekend the temperatures were well above the norm - the room was stifling hot - Electric Fan available upon request.  There is also plenty of traffic noise from the motorway that runs parallel to the hotel so if your not used to this, then be prepared for sleepless nights.  On one side of the hotel there is also a building site which is pretty noisy, so don't expect a peaceful lay-in, if you stay Monday to Friday!.  On the whole though the hotel is modern and the rooms are very clean, comfortable and well serviced.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an apartment and also got a Lounge with TV and kitchen - although we did'nt use it because we spent most of our time in the City.  Getting to and from the City Centre - walk down to the Liffey Valley Retail Park and go into a newsagent and get yourself a bus pass.  3 day pass was about 10 Euro's each (adult).  Journey times vary from between 25 minutes to 45 minutes depending on traffic / time of day.  Alternatively, Taxi costs about 20 Euro's and takes about the same length of time.  We also used the the Bar area in the hotel and had 2 good meals there (Asian Cuisine - mainly curry's), the service was very fast.  Also, next door to the hotel there is a trendy cocktail bar / restaurant which is a nice place to relax and wind down if you don't want to be restricted to the hotel bar environment.  As for the City, Dublin is great, the people are fantastic and we will be coming back!.

249,"Fab food, brill shopping nearby!","We stayed at the Liffey Valley in May 06 with our baby daughter.  The rooms were perfect with big cosy beds and lovely bathrooms.  Free car parking and felt quite safe to leave car there.  Didn't get to leisure facilities but would highly recommend both restaurants in hotel.  We really loved the thai food. Breakfast was great too. There is also a beautiful restaurant right next to hotel called Lemongrass.  Liffey Valley shopping centre is a short stroll away and has all the big high street shops you could want.  We had a brilliant time and will definately go back to this hotel anytime we go to Dublin.  Only downside is that it is not in the centre of Dublin but you would be lucky to get such a great hotel for the price in the centre.

249,good value/far from down town,"Clarion Liffey Valley is a nice large modern american style hotel and a very good deal for the money.  It has a dinning room, nice bar and even a spa. It is a  easy 20 minutes bus ride to  down town Dublin by ridding bus #25A.  Be sure to take this bus (#25A), the other bus takes over a hour to down town Dublin; ask the front desk clerk for directions to the bus stop.   If you are looking to stay in downtown Dublin; or in a place with a  lot todo around it at night, do not stay here.

249,Lovely Modern Hotel - Great value,"We stayed in the Clarion for the May Bank Holiday weekend.  The rooms were lovely - very clean and modern.  Any staff we were in contact with were friendly and professional, overall the hotel was great value and we cou;d not complain about anything.  The Pool & jaccuzzi were lovely and my husband said the gym was one of the best he has been to.  The location beside Liffey Valley S.C and 5min drive from Blanchardstown S.C is excellent.  If you were going to Dublin shopping there would be no need to go into the city as these two shopping centers have all the best shops of the city center anyway.  However, if you do wish to go into the city, have a car and want to avoid taking the bus I would recommend driving 5mins down the M50 to the next slip road (RED COW ROUNDABOUT). Go to the far side of the roundabout and you will see the LUAS stop and carparking.  You are able to park and ride.  Carparking is only €4 FOR 24hrs and the LUAS about €3.50 return.  We found this to be excellent as it stops right outside the Jervis S.C on Henry Street and is handy for Temple Bar etc.  It was very handy and was a safe clean way to travel.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definetly return!!

249,"Lovely, clean hotel","Stayed here for a package weekend.  We were very happy with the rooms, restaurant, bar but seen as its fairly new it would have to be.  Rooms were very spacious with nice decor, bathroom a lovely size and perfectly clean.  Beds extremely comfortable and plenty of storage space in the room also.   
Breakfast was buffet style so plenty to chose from for all tastes.  
The Hotel is reasonably quiet at night and within easy reach of the city centre plus the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is also within walking distance of the Hotel.
Would stay there again as the rooms are lovely and the Hotel itself is quite relaxing.

249,Pure nightmare!!,"My husband and i were given a weekend trip to Dublin as a wedding present and we only stayed because the accomodation was already paid for and our friend would not have been able to get a refund.

I have worked in hospitality for 12 years and never have i come across such rude staff and poor service. We had to wait hours for our room to be ready and when it was our mini bar was unstocked, as in NOTHING in the fridge. Our bags were held in the office for us until the room was ready and then my husband had to go in and fish them out himself while 2 staff looked on asking if he knew which one was his.

Out of 2 tv's in the room only one got a partial picture and then when we asked for someone to please look at it we had to wait 2 hours.

On our 2nd night we decided to order room service instead of going out as the cost for taxi's to and from the hotel was getting expensive because its quite a bit out of the town. We ordered our food at 8pm and were told that there might be wait as the restaurant was very busy, which was fine until 2 hours later and we still didn't have any food. After calling room service and it ringing out once then being hung up on we eventually got someone in reception who couldn't even find the order we had made. Eventually another half hour later we got our food (on the house) which was cold and dry and tasted like it had been sitting under some heat lamps for about 2 and a half hours!!! (which it no doubt was)

The restaurants had no atmosphere and lloked like a bad DIY/interior design job. One morning for breakfast we had to wait 15 minutes to get milk to put in the already cold coffee we had ordered. 

This hotel had no strusture of business at all. No one knew what they were doing and this was blatant. I hope for their sakes they have gotten better at running a hotel because our experience there was appalling. We fell in love with Dublin and it was such a shame that we had to stay at that awful hotel.

WARNING TO YOU ALL...DO NOT STAY THERE!!

249,Best Hotel in the World!!,"I can not say how much I loved this hotel…

Rooms:  Spacious even for three people, clean, the beds are amazing and new, room safe, mini bar, internet, huge bathroom, and free spa items.

Staff: the staff were so nice and accommodating, everyone greets you with a smile and can answer any question.

Location: ok so it is about 20 mins outside of Dublin, at first we thought this was bad but it is kind of nice to be in a private area outside of the city.  There is a bus stop about 5 mins. walk (you can see it from the hotel) and the city center is the last stop on the bus.  There is a mall in walking distance with lots of stores, movie theater and a few restaurants (pizza Hut).  The restaurant in the hotel is wonderful but expensive, then they also have a bar that offers Japanese food that was really good, but if you want your sox knocked off then go to the restaurant next to the hotel Lemongrass, their Japanese food was to die for.  Also there is a bar called cheers that served burgers and steaks at a reasonable price but you better dress nicely they have a dress code that they stick too.

The thing that was the best about this hotel is the free spa that you get to use as you stay there.  The pool, sauna, steam room and workout room was incredible we absolutely loved it!!!  It was so relaxing to stay at this hotel.  

The hotel is far from the city but that is actually what we loved about it, we could relax at the hotel then take a short bus ride in and get to see more of Dublin, I will ABSOLUTLY stay at Clarion Liffey again.",5,2006,03,15
249,More Liffey Valley than Dublin!,"At E99 a room per night on the hotel's own website, this is a reasonably priced hotel of excellent standard.  It is so far out of Dublin however that I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a car.
The hotel still has a newish feel and the decor and ambience of reception and bedrooms is above average. Cannot comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there but could recommend Joel's Restaurant a five minute drive away on the N7.  We also tried the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre for dining but found mainly fast food outlets and nothing we could recommend, not even for breakfast.
Only two negatives concerning the hotel was the lack of any TV sports channels and the noise in the bedroom corridor.  We had room 205 which was at the start of the corridor so we had some rather noisey guests passing by our door for most of the night.  Request a room at the other end of the corridor and enjoy a good nights sleep in an otherwise excellent hotel.

249,Luxury,"While outside Dublin, this is a newly opened 4 star hotel offering cheap rates. We stayed overnight enroute from the west coast to the airport and loved the luxury of hot bubble baths, satellite TV and comfy beds after more basic accommodation elsewhere in Ireland. There are several places to eat at the shopping centres near the hotel - We recommend the Thai restaurant.
",5,2006,02,16
249,Had a fabulous time,"We just got back from a week in Dublin, staying the entire time at the Clarion Liffey Valley.  I had some doubts going in because the Clarion is not in the city center.  It is a walk to the bus stop and it's more than 5 minutes like they tell you at the front desk.  It's more like 10-15 minutes, depending on how fast you walk.  But it's not a bad walk and we adjusted.  

Despite what other reviewers have said, we had very pleasant interactions with the staff at the hotel.  We found them to be friendly, polite, informative and professional.  The hotel even kept their lounge open late so we could watch the Superbowl!  That meant that someone had to bartend until nearly 4 am, which they did without complaint!

The rooms are very large by European standards and the beds are wonderfully comfortable.  The bathrooms are good-sized too!  Each room has a coffee maker and a mini bar, which was something we hadn't expected at all either.  

My only real complaint about the hotel is that the breakfasts are very expensive!  It was 11 euros for a brunch of cereal and fruit and bread and 16 euros if you wanted to include eggs and meat.  When converted to US dollars, that's roughly $20 for breakfast!  We found it easier to keep some fruit in our room and eat once we got downtown.  The Asian restaurant in the hotel, however, has reasonable prices and good food. 

At the price we paid per night for this hotel, it was an excellent value and an extremely nice place to come home to at night!
",4,2006,02,13
249,Some Hotel Facts!,"The hotel is modern and spacious, decor in rooms is what you expect from a 4 star modern hotel: a high standard. The hotel was busy the first night & the room doors bang loudly. A nice hotel bar & breakfast is good (cost 11.5 Euros), pool is nice but you have to wear a swim cap (can be bought there)!
The hotel is a few miles from the city centre and although buses go frequently (every 15 mins) its a 5-10 min walk to the bus stop -its under 2 Euros each to get in and takes about 20 mins. 
Taxis are about 20 Euros to city centre and about 30 to the airport which can be busy in rush hour due to the toll road.
A nice pub next door (the Arc) which gets busy on a saturday night.
We went here because it was an inexpensive hotel with a pool but not sure the pool was worth the hassle of getting into the city.
",4,2006,02,10
249,Very Friendly,"We stayed at the Clarion for 3 nights it was very good! The receptionist were very plesent and heplful, with things to visit etc. We had a slight prodlem with breakfast not being included on our room although we had paid for it but this was sorted out straight away. The other staff in the hotel were also nice and always smiling and said ""Hello"".
Overall a pleasent stay and worth the trip on the bus to the outskirts of Dublin, Even if only for the shopping complex 400 meters from Hotel.
",5,2006,02,09
249,could do much better,"I stayed in this hotel twice with my wife in the second half of 2005. The first time we stayed it was good.The staff, food and rooms were fine the only complaint we had was the slow service at the bar on the Saturday night. 
The second time we stayed was a different experience. This time the staff were very rude and unhelpful, especially in the bar area where it was almost impossible to get served a drink on the Saturday night. 
On the Sunday night quite a few of the bar patrons wanted to watch television highlights of an important football match played earlier that day. The staff kept turning the volume down on the TV to the annoyance of myself and about 99% of the rest of the customers. When we complained the staff were very unhepful and unco-operative. To top that, the TVs in all the hotel rooms weren't working and so we had no choice but to suffer and try and watch the game in the bar. 
on the Monday morning the buffet breakfast which was normally good, was very disappointing with a very limited selection on offer.
On check out I made my complaints to the duty manager who I earlier had had some ""words"" and who I felt had been a bit cheeky towards me. I have to say she redeemed herself by apologising and only taking 50% payment for our stay. Although this ""softened the blow"" it did not make up for a bad experience.
",2,2006,02,07
249,What a superb base,"My daughter and I  have just spent 3 nights at the Clarion Liffey and would like to comment on our experience.  Room: tastefully decorated and furnished with good quality bedding, towels,toiletries, tea, coffee etc and a window that opened (great for hot flushes!)and iron/board and hairdryer. Location: Up-and-coming commercial area within 5-10 minutes walk to a big shopping complex housing all the usual high street stores.  Yes there is some building work in the area but this did not affect the hotel at all.  Staff: Professional and helpful and will respond to jokes/banter if they feel it is appropriate.  Transport:  We bought a 3 day rover bus ticket from the airport when we arrived which gave us unlimited travel while we were there.  It meant we had to catch a bus from the airport into town and out again but this was very easy to do and with the total price of the 3 day ticket for 2 costing only 8 euros each this is very good value. We went into town twice a day. There is a bit of a walk to the bus stop from the hotel but loads of buses and I think it wont be long before there is a bus that will stop outside the hotel.  We caught a taxi from the hotel to the airport on our return journey and this cost us 25 euros and took about 25 minutes (did too much shopping to use bus to go back!). We boooked room only and ate breakfast/brunch at the nearby shopping complex when we went out as this gave us the chance to lie in.  Very good gym and pool. This hotel is a very good standard and excellent value and I would urge anyone (perhaps not with mobility difficulties unless you  have a car) to use it.  Much better than the jaded musty smelling inner city hotels with groups of stag/hen parties roaming the corridors!
",5,2006,02,01
249,Modern and stylish,"Hotel reception very cool and clean, staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Nursing a hangover, I checked in and went to my room on the gorund floor and was impressed by the standard of fittings and decor. I have paid double in the recent past for much less!! Bed's are comfortable and there is a wide range of channels on the TV.

The restaurant is probably a bit too formal for me, so I didn't try it, but the oriental themed bar food next door was very good. The service was a bit lacklustre though.

I didn't get a chance to try the spa or gym facilties, though I am assured they are quite good.

On the downside, the out of town location means that, really, you need a car. For those looking for a non-city business base or a stop off point to the airport or further afield, I would recommend it. I paid €84 for my room, a discount rate based on limited availablity.
",4,2006,01,19
249,"Modern, rude staff, frightening area","Stayed here in October 2005. Bit surprised to find the hotel right bang in the centre of very heavy building works in the surrounding area. Not to mention the ongoing work within the hotel itself. Lovely modern feel to this place, receptionist cold and unwelcoming though. Room very large and with a balcony overlooking the large carpark. No air-con, but did have opening windows which was a real pleasure as the room continually smelled of paint!. Only real big problem with the room was that it had 2 connecting doors to rooms either side and people in both rooms could be heard as clear as day. a baby to the right and a bunch of kids to the left.....and the hallways littered daily with builders debris which for my entire 4 day stay was never cleaned. Very handy for the 'liffy valley shopping centre' which only a 5 minute walk away.Caught the local bus service into Dublin City which detours right through the adjasent housing estate......all i can say is 'AVOID THE NUMBER 74 BUS AT ALL COSTS'' I was travelling with youngsters taking drugs right out in front of all passengers and the route passed several buring cars and what looked like gang warfare TERRIFYING !!!.
",3,2005,12,09
249,Great Value & Close to airport,"We booked this hotel because it was close to the airport and offered convenience for our very early flight out the next day. I was impressed with the rooms and bathrooms - very modern and clean. The staff however were less than warm and made no effort to make us (party of 10) feel welcome.
It was the best priced hotel for the location and I would highly recommend it, however don't expect the staff to be as excited about the property as I am!
Note of caution: When ordering a wake up call double check it was booked accuratley to avoid missing your flight as we almost did! Staff again did not care about this either! Too bad.",4,2005,12,08
249,OK but food service iffy,"I stayed in this hotel as part of a conference booking.   The room was what you would expect from a brand new hotel - clean etc but was a bit hot and I couldn't work out how to turn the heat down.    Service in the restaraunt was VERY slow and the liver pate starter I had was very dissappointing.    They also managed to give me the bill ( in an envelope for someone else!).    Don't expect any Craic as almost all the staff are eastern europeans.

On the plus side the leisure centre is very good with a 20 metre pool but you need to buy a swim cap.
",3,2005,12,08
249,"Great rooms, cold reception","I went to this hotel September this year with two of my girlfriends. Thought the hotel looked great at first, really clean and contemporary recpetion area. We arrived at around 7am after a long drive to Wales and then a trip on the ferry to Dublin, so were pretty tired as you can imagine. When we got there we produced our booking reference (all booked through expedia) and gave our name. They could not find our reservation, so we gave all of our names, still no luck. Despite having paid already, we were made to feel like we shouldn't be there and had made up this reservation! Eventually after spelling all of our names AND again reminding them it was booked through Expedia - they found it, under an expedia booking in the name we had originally said. 

Finally we got up to the room, this was worth the wait, they really are gorgeous and SO comfortable. The curtains are so thick you can't hear any traffic noise and it keeps the room dark, perfect for us after a night at Temple Bar!

The reception staff continued to treat us like we shouldn't be there throughout our stay - although they were very helpful over the phone, booked taxis etc. They did not ruin our stay though, hotel is lovely just a shame about the staff and their attitude towards young guests.

If you are going (like we were) on a holiday to go out in the evenings, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, it's about 20mins drive from Temple Bar and on the way back is REALLY hard to get a taxi to take you that far. TIP: If you do try to get a taxi back, get the number of the taxi firm the hotel always use, they were brilliant and didn't over charge or anything.

Dublin is a great city, and the people are great, except the staff in this hotel (none of which were Irish!)

249,Great 'new' hotel,"The hotel had just opened when i stayed. I stayed on the second night they were open and then again later that week.  
I found the hotel to be very comfortable and welcoming, the staff were friendly and the room very clean.  
I was put off slightly by the early wake up call of the work men but this was to be expected!
I had room service and the wait was not that long and the food was divine!! It was well presented and the staff were all courteous!!
Definintely worth a stay!
I never had the chance to experience the leisure facilities as these were yet to open whilst i stayed.
",5,2005,10,11
249,Great hotel,"One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. We didn't sample the food as we dined in town or in the shopping centre. The beds were very comfortable and the room decor really lovely. As has already been said the shopping centre is across the road and also there is a regular bus service to the city centre.  Took all the hassle out of staying in Dublin and would definitely stay there again. The leisure centre is a huge plus and enticed us to stay an extra night.
",5,2005,09,08
249,"Nice,clean and bright","The hotel is spotless rooms clean and bathroom lovely.The leisure centre is very good.Staff we not hugely helpfull at reception.
I stayed in this hotel on Aug20/21.Booked a triple room for myself and my two little nieces as we were on a weekend away treat.Unfortunatly, when we arrived we ended up in a double/single which was most annoying as this ment we had to double up.

I had also requested a quiet room away from traffic but we ended up above the bus park,which wouldn't have been so bad if we could have closed the window,but as the room was far too hot and there was no airconditioning we spent most of the night awake listening to buses comming and going.
I would stay here again,but I would ring to make sure they book you in to the correct room type and maybe request a fan if the weather is warm.
Very good base for shopping,liffey valley center just up the road and Blanchards town or Dundrum centers only 15 mins away by car max.
4 star rooms and facilities but definatly not 4 star service :-(

The breakfast was impressive with much choice and service good.We ate Dinner in the restaurant and although the menu and food was good the service was considerably slow,usually taking 2hours from start to finish.
I would definitely recommend this hotel,providing you have a car and would stay again.

I would definitely stay here again.

The good points are they have proper beds, not zipped up the middle, nice bathrooms with deep tubs and although not quite working yet the rooms have plug and play broadband and also wifi.  Room service took about 30 minutes but was well worth the wait, the best hotel food I've ever had.  Breakfast in the room was good too, this is one of very few hotels to get the breakfast order right, the food was also hot including the toast.  There were a few glitches with the hotel just being opened but all were dealt with very professionally by the staff who took great interest in the few negative comments I had.  The rooms are beautiful and the staff very attentive and friendly.  Although the Clarion brand is not consitant this is by far one of the better hotels.

Articoli da bagno non riforniti giornalmente, colazione ben fornita di salato ma molto scarsa di dolce. Tè, latte e caffè solo alla macchinetta. Inavvicinabile per prezzi il ristorante interno, con piatti denominati in italiano ma di dubbia fedeltà alla nostra tradizione culinaria: eppure il ristorante era sempre pieno, certamente per la scomodità dei gruppi di dover prendere un mezzo per andare in città.

Servicio correcto a veces pasable solo. Conseguir que te contesten para subir una manta más a las 21h es misión casi imposible. 
Mucha moqueta como en todos los hoteles por aquí. Habitaciones correctas sin grandes lujos ni muy grandes pero tienes de todo. La cama es cómoda y las cortinas cierran bien. El pero más gordo es que un hotel de estos diga teniendo bañera solo y además con cortina y no mampara.

249,NO VOLVERÉ,"Fuimos para realizar una competición en Dublín, por lo que éramos muchas personas de diferentes países alojadas en ese hotel, ofrecido por la Delegación. 

En cuanto al idioma, español no saben. Algunos teníamos cierto nivel de inglés por lo que nos pudimos finalmente entender, aunque con algunas dificultades porque el inglés de Irlanda no es precisamente el que estudiamos en el colegio, pero eso es otra cosa que nada tiene que ver. En este aspecto he de destacar que mandé un correo previo a mi viaje al email del hotel, y todavía no ha sido respondido. 

En cuanto a las habitaciones, están bastante bien, aunque el hotel está pegado a la autovía. Desde mi habitación solo veía las ramas de un árbol, pero tampoco fui allí a estar mirando por la ventana, o sea que respecto a la habitación no pongo pegas. Solo avisar de que no hay aire acondicionado, hay ventilador, aunque sí hay calefacción. De todos modos no creo que allí haga mucha falta utilizar el ventilador. 

Ahora viene el desastre, las comidas. Teníamos contratado el desayunar y cenar ahí. Teniendo en cuenta que era un hotel de 4 estrellas, pensábamos que era buffet, PERO NO. Llegamos y teníamos para elegir un primero que era o salmón o lasaña (deconstruida porque parecía sopa), y luego para acompañar o una patata cocida o brócoli. De beber agua supongo que del grifo, si quieres algún refresco pues lo pagas. La cara de asco fue multitudinaria. Entonces, como había pan pues empezamos a pedir aceite para poder comer algo en condiciones. 

El segundo día he de decir que la cena mejoró, aunque el sistema era el mismo, elección de platos y luego un postre (todos los días el postre era lo mismo, dos pequeñas tartas cada una de un sabor, pero cada día los sabores eran diferentes). El segundo día había un pollo y arroz similar al que podemos comer en el chino. El siguiente día la cena consistió en un pollo empanado, bastante duro, y no recuerdo la otra opción. Otro día escogí espaguetis, que estaban aceptables. Y el último día vino lo mejor, una sopa (si es que se puede llamar así) y sándwiches... después de estar 14h en un campeonato. En este caso rechazamos la comida y nos fuimos a la habitación, puesto que fuimos listos y compramos comida en el supermercado. 

El desayuno es mejor, puedes elegir, hay bollería, algunas frutas, zumos, leche. Para conseguir agua o aceite tenías que pedirlo. Creo que algunas personas consiguieron cacao para la leche, no fue nuestro caso (no sé si porque no nos entendieron). 

Respecto al servicio, el personal de la recepción muy amable. Hay un chico que no sabemos si es que vivía allí, porque siempre estaba. Este chico se portó muy bien con nosotros, muy paciente, intentando entendernos. Además, una compañera se dejó olvidada en el hall una cámara de fotos profesional y llamamos por teléfono y nos dijeron que la habían encontrado y guardado (sí, en este caso nos entendieron a la primera). 

En cuanto al personal encargado de la cena, una chica rubia,  (Gosia creemos que se llamaba) no podía tener más cara de asco y tratar peor a los clientes. Se cabreaba cuando no la entendían (pues todo el mundo no sabía inglés) y empezaba a decir palabras malsonantes (algunas las entendíamos y otras no, pero tono amable no tenían). Sin comentarios. Sin embargo, he de destacar la paciencia de un chico de color que además de saber un poco de español, intentaba resolver las difíciles situaciones que se daban en el comedor, pues todo el mundo se quejaba por la cena y no siempre de buenas maneras. 

En definitiva, las habitaciones bien. El servicio, si hablas inglés supongo que bien, si no está más complicado. Los camareros: algunos muy bien (para construirles un monumento por la santa paciencia) y otros creo que no deberían trabajar nunca más cara al público. 
Y la comida: NEFASTA. Sin embargo, no sé si esto se debe a la organización del campeonato o al hotel, puesto que al quejarnos cada uno le atribuía la responsabilidad al otro. 

Por si acaso, nosotros no volvemos ya que otras personas estuvieron en un hotel cercano, más barato y tenían buffet libre.  (Maldron Hotel Dublin Airport).",1,2017,11,09
249,Hotel de 4* con servicio de 2*,"Hotel situado en un parque industrial. Estuvimos alojados en una habitación pegada a la autopista, con mucho ruido y poca climatizada (sensación de frio) y un servicio (desayuno y cena) muy pobre.
No volveré.",1,2017,10,29
249,No merece 4 estrellas,"Desde luego para nada merece este hotel la calificación de 4*. La calefacción en general brillaba por su ausencia, en particular en zonas comunes. La habitación ruidosa, pegada a la autovia, mucho ruido y las vistas al parquing del hotel y una grúa.
La atención y amabilidad del personal, deja mucho que desear. La estancia fue en grupo, y sólo decir que el horario del desayuno era de 7:00 a 10:30 y no nos dejaban entrar a desayunar porque como teníamos que salir del hotel alrededor de las 7.30, nos preparaban picnic. La leche servida directamente en las garrafas de plástico, ni jarras, ni caliente....
No recomiendo este hotel, y mucho menos como un 4*. Las dos noches anteriores, las pasamos en otro 4* de la zona, y si lo comparamos, parecía 5* super lujo.",1,2017,10,25
249,BUEN HOTEL,"Estupendo hotel, magnifica habitación con camas confortables. Limpio. Personal muy amable, correcto y profesional. (No hablan español...) Tiene parking, está ""cerca"" de un  gran centro comercial y bastante alejado de la ciudad de Dublin. Recomendable",4,2017,10,03
249,"Auftakt unserer Busreise, Hotel absolut ok","Auftakthotel für unsere Busreise, Hotel okay.
Leider etwas ausserhalb, daher für uns nicht mehr möglich in die Stadt zu kommen.
In der Nähe ist ein Einkaufszentrum, mit div. Möglichkeiten zu Essen.
Lautstärke im Hotel war okay. Ich schlafe immer mit Ohrstöpsel und das war absolut okay. Kaffee (Trockenkaffee) und Tee auf Zimmer.

Ich füge bei jeder Hotelbewertung in Irland folgenden Satz ein:
Man darf den Standard nicht mit Deutschland vergleichen.
Bäder sind nicht nicht so wie in deutschen Hotels. und auch die Sauberkeit ist nicht wie im Deutschland. Daher muss man Abstriche machen,",3,2017,09,08
249,Muy satisfecho,"Dentro de un paquete de viaje pasé la noche del día 22/08/2017 en este hotel y quedé muy satisfecho. En primer lugar, no sé el motivo, pero en lugar de una habitación me dieron un apartamento. El cual, además de la habitación, tenía recibidor, un cuarto con lavadora y un comedor con su cocina. No pude aprovecharlo porque únicamente iba a dormir. Todo estaba muy limpio, moderno y cuidado.

En cuanto al parking, el hotel dispone, pero sólo es gratuito por un tiempo de 3 horas, si lo dejabas más tiempo o la noche como en mi caso eran 6 euros. 

El hotel se encuentra en las afueras de Dublín, por lo que depende que vayas a hacer puede ser un inconveniente, pero no fue mi caso. En cambio, dispones de un gran centro comercial muy cerca, lo que para mí fue un gran acierto.

El desayuno fue mi correcto, había variedad para el desayuno continental y el americano/ingles.

Por último, en la recepción fueron muy amables (mi inglés es bastante malo). Cuando hice el Check-out por la mañana me atendió la chica más guapa que vería en una semana entera por Irlanda e Irlanda del Norte, claro que se llamaba Bella, el nombre ya lo dice.

En resumen, muy buen hotel y me volvería a hospedar si tuviera que volver a Dublín, y más teniendo en cuenta algún hotel en que me tocó hospedarme días después.",5,2017,09,02
249,"Gut ausgestattet, lauer Service aber tlw. laut","Das Hotel hat große Zimmer und Betten. Wichtig: Es hat ein sauberes Bad, Kaffee im Zimmer, kostenloses WiFi auch im Zimmer.
Die Zimmer sind tlw. laut, weil direkt am Motorway. TIPP. Darauf achten ein Zimmer zur anderen Straßenseite zu bekommen. Es gab leider wenig Wasserdruck, Zimmer hat keine Klimaanlage, Geruch im Bad vrmtl. durch geringe Spülkraft des Wasser können Gase aufsteigen.

Das Frühstücks Angebot war ok. Die Bestände wurden aber nicht mehr aufgefüllt und vor Ende der Zeit wurden Reste einfach weggenommen. Der Kaffee war zu dünn -like tea- oder so stark, dass nicht trinkbar.

Service war einigermaßen ok",3,2017,07,01
249,Hotel ist ok aber zu teuer für das Gebotene,"Zimmer war adäquat. Sauber war es. Im TV gabs sogar ZDF. Internet war sehr gut. Der Pool war super. Kinder und Erwachsene haben dort Spass. Da sehen sie es nicht ganz so eng wie woanders. Badekappen nicht vergessen! Das asiatische Essen in der Bar war hervoragend. Der Service weniger.

Für 4 Sterne etwas mau. Abgewohnt. Eindeutig zu teuer.  Zimmer an der Straße mit Tankstelle gegenüber. Frühstück mittelmäßig. Wenn man auf den Pool verzichten kann tuts jedes B&B.",3,2017,06,21
249,Auftakt für Busreisen,"- Zimmer liegen alle zur Strasse, Autobahn oder zum Parkplatz hin
- sehr wenige gehen in Richtung Autobahn und Autohändler
- teilweise sind die Betten durchgelegen

- essen wird eingeteilt und es gibt keinen Nachschlag

- Personal langsam oder total hektisch (je nachdem wen man erwischt)",1,2017,06,21
249,Es geht so,"Was soll man zu dem Hotelzimmer sagen? Eigentlich 4 Sterne. Ich würde die auf keinen Fall vergeben. Die Zimmer sind einfach, sauber und okay. Das Bad hingegen ist spärlich und alt. Das Frühstück ist sehr ordentlich aber das Essen in der Bar/ Restaurant Kundos ist gerade Mittelmaß. Auf der anderen Seite bietet das Hotelzimmer einen attraktiven Preis. Für Dublin Besucher aber sehr weit ""draussen"".
Insgesamt befriedigend. 
Für Familien mit Kindern gibt es wohl attraktive Angebote. ",3,2017,06,12
249,Etwas abseits,"Wir haben dieses Hotel im Rahmen einer Busrundreise für eine Nacht kennengelernt. Es liegt außerhalb von Dublin und nicht wirklich attraktiv. Umgeben von der Autobahn und inmitten eines kleinen Industriegebiets. Ein Einkaufszentrum kann in ca. 10Min. erreicht werden, schließt aber um 19 Uhr (die Restaurants aber erst um 22 Uhr).
Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet und sauber. Frühstück am Buffet und sowohl irisch als auch kontinental gut bestückt. Abends kann man auch gut im Hotel essen, macht preislich keinen Unterschied zu den Restaurants am Einkaufszentrum.",4,2017,04,14
249,Alles Super!,"Sauber, Nettes Personal, nette Menschen, schöne Zimmer, halbwegs Faire Preise. Etwas weit entfernt vom Zentrum aber nicht störend. Insgesamt Top! Preise waren zum St. Patricks Day um 200% erhöht. Dennoch kann man sich hier gut erholen wenn es lange durch die Stadt ging. Es ist außerdem sehr ruhig in der Gegend.",5,2017,03,18
249,Durchschnittlich,"Wir waren über St. Patricks Day in Dublin und da es zeitlich schon knapp war haben wir dieses Hotel gebucht. Es ist etwas ausserhalb der Stadt und eher nur mit dem Auto erreichbar. Parkmöglichkeiten auf dem Hotelparkplatz sind gegen Bezahlung (ich denke es waren um die 10€ pro Tag)vorhanden. Die Rezeption war immer sehr höflich. Leider war es nachts immer sehr laut, da einige Leute im Hotel weiter St. Patricks Day gefeiert haben. Zimmer waren sauber und durchschnittlich groß. Wir hatten ein 4er Zimmer, mit einem Doppelbett und zwei Einzelbetten. Unser Bad war ausgestattet mit einer Badewanne. Der Föhn befand sich im Vorzimmer, sowie auch ein kleiner Kühlschrank und ein Wasserkocher.

Mit dem Auto gelangt man auch in ca. 5 Minuten zu einem Hofer und einem Lidl. 

Würde dieses Hotel nur empfehlen wenn man ein Mietauto hat, glaube öffentlich eher schwer zu erreichen.",4,2017,02,27
249,Hotel ottimo però...,"Niente da dire all'hotel, al momento della prenotazione ci hanno detto che è collegato, verissimo dopo che ti sei fatto circa 800 metri per prendere il bus per andare in centro città e credetemi d'inverno non è il massimo, quindi sconsigliato a chi porta con se dei bimbi piccoli. Del resto pulito, bello e colazione internazionale molto gradevole",2,2017,01,23
249,"Buono, ma non il meglio.","L'hotel è enorme, ha molte stanze, le quali sono praticamente tutte uguali! Devo dire che sono abbastanza puliti, da questo punto di vista non posso dire nulla, c'è anche una piscina e un grande ristorante, è possibile fare un abbondante colazione a circa 14€! Personale della reception scortese e il riscaldamento della camera va regolato dal termosifone che si trova sotto la finestra, non c'è un sistema nella stanza! Ne consiglio il pernottamento solo se riuscite a trovare un'offerta ad un prezzo vantaggioso.",3,2017,01,05
249,Una gran oportunidad pero debes andar en auto,"Nos quedamos en este hotel a unos 12 kilómetros en las afueras de Dublin y fue una gran alternativa de buena calidad a un costo muy razonable.
Por € 80 por noche en habitación matrimonial este hotel ofrece habitaciones espaciosas, camas muy buenas y baños muy limpios.
Tienes que pagar € 6 adicionales por estacionar el auto y no incluye el desayuno en ese precio.
Una buena alternativa para un 4 estrellas aunque se debe tener claro que estás a más de 15 minutos de Dublin en la noche y unos 30 minutos en la hora de alto tráfico.
Si vas a viajar al interior de Irlanda está al lado de las autopistas.",4,2016,09,23
249,Muy correcto,"Muy atentos los recepcionistas y todo en general. El primer dia nos faltaba una toalla por la noche bajamos a recepción y al momento ya nos la habian llevado a la habitación, roponen todos los dias las cosas para aseo personal, las camas hechas cada dia y todo como lo dejabamos al salir ( referido a cosas personales) sitio recomendable y barato al menos a mediados de septiembre, importante saber que tiene una parada de bus muy cerca que te lleva al centro y en la que te dejan desde el centro y auntobus que te lleva desde la puerta del hotel al aeropuerto.",5,2016,09,15
249,großes Hotel außerhalb von Dublin,"Das Hotel liegt ca. 13 km von Dublin entfernt. Wird vom Airhopper Bus angefahren, der vom Flughafen zum Hotel und wieder zurück fährt. Bushaltestelle für Bus in die Stadt liegt etwa 10 Gehminuten vom hotel entfernt.
Angestellte am Empfang sind nur teilweise freundlich. Wir hatten das Hotel im Zuge einer Rundreise gebucht und sowohl am Anfang als auch am Ende ein Zimmer zur Schnellstraße  raus, was nachts sehr laut war. Nachdem das Zimmer keine Klimaanlage hatte, mussten wir das Fenster aber öffnen, da es in dem Zimmer sehr heiß  war.
der Frühstücksraum ist sehr groß, der Service allerding nicht sehr gut. Tische werden nicht abgeräumt, Reste vom vorherigen Gast einfach mit einem dreckigen Lappen vom Tisch auf den Boden oder Stuhl gewischt. Das Frühstück selbst ist ausreichend: Würstchen, Bohnen, Rührei und Schinken, 1 Sorte Wurst und Käse, 2 Sorten Marmelade, Toast, Brötchen, sehr gutes Brot und süßes Blundergebäck, Kaffee, Tee und Säfte.
Füreinen Städtetrip ist das Hotel eindeutig zu weit draußen. Die Shopping Mall liegt ca 5 Gehminuten entfernt, schließt aber bereits um 19 Uhr, außer Donnerstag - 21 Uhr.",3,2016,09,11
249,Muy bien pero falla la limpieza ,"He estado alojado con mi mujer y mi hijo de 3 años y mi hija de 15 meses. Llegamos a la 1 del mediodía y no nos dejaron hacer el check-in hasta las 3. Tuvimos que esperar en el hotel. Estuvimos alojados en una executive suite king room. La habitación perfecta de unos 60 con una cama de matrimonio y un salón con kitchenette de unos 20 metros. Muchísima amplitud para pasar una semana. La cocina no tenia vitrocerámica, sólo microondas. Lo peor fue la limpieza. Hubo un día que no nos hicieron la habitación y el resto de los días únicamente nos dejaban las toallas y hacían las camas. Ni aspiraban la moqueta ni hacían el baño. El penúltimo día puse una reclamación y me entrevisté con el director del hotel. Nos hicieron toda la habitación y nos pidieron disculpas. El personal es muy atento y profesional. El parking es de pago, 6 euros por día. La piscina perfecta y con amplio horario. Quiero destacar la seguridad para entrar a la zona de habitaciones, hay que pasar la tarjeta de la habitación para pasar a la zona de habitaciones,  y en los vestuarios de las piscinas hay que introducir una clave. Tienen un parque exterior y otro interior. También tienen billar, futbolin y consolas en una sala. Tiene un club infantil pero aceptan niños a partir de 4 años. Es perfecto para ir con hijos, los míos disfrutaron muchísimo del hotel. También quiero comentar que las zonas comunes también están un poco sucias. Mi mujer tuvo que pasar una toalllita en un pantalla de juegos para los niños porque estaba tan sucia que no reconocía los dedos para hacer un puzzle. ",4,2016,08,21
249,Albergo gigante in periferia di Dublino ,"Hotel molto bello,siamo venuti qui per 2 giorni del nostro tour irlandese ma ci siamo poi spostati in centro x godere meglio della meravigliosa Dublino. Struttura moderna e gigantesca. La camera era molto grande,sempre pulita e curata. Anche il bagno era grande,letti comodi. Personale gentile e sempre disponibile. La zona è un po' fuori il centro di Dublino,se non fosse per il centro commerciale vicino non c'è davvero nulla...per arrivare in centro o si prende il taxi oppure vicino c'è la fermata del bus sulla superstrada. In conclusione l'hotel è davvero molto bello,ma se volete stare in centro non lo consiglio. ",3,2016,08,05
249,"Zimmer ok, Frühstück und Extras naja","Grundsätzlich ist das Zimmer und ins besondere das Bad sauber. Es gibt zusätzlich einen Wasserkocher mit Tee oder Kaffee und eine Kühlschrank. Das Bett ist zwar für ein Doppelbett recht klein aber sauber und angenehm. 

Jedoch lässt in jedem Fall der Ausblick zu wünschen übrig. Entweder Blick auf die Autobahn oder Blick auf den Parkplatz. 

Auch ist das freie WiFi in den Flügeln des Hotels nicht existent. 

Das Frühstück hat eine gute Auswahl, ist aber erstens auch beim geschmacklosen Rührei und dem Schinken kalt und der genutzte Raum nicht für die Anzahl der möglichen Gäste ausgelegt, was durch Extratische zu kaschieren versucht wird.

Dadurch sitzt ein Teil der Gäste recht ungemütlich.

Liegt etwas außerhalb von Dublin, daher Auto, Taxi oder Bus benötigt.",3,2016,07,29
249,Aufenthalt mit Reisegruppe,"Einfache,aber ausreichende Ausstattung, sauber und gediegen. Zentrum Dublin weit entfernt, nur mit Bus oder Taxi (1/2 Std. Fahrzeit) zu erreichen. Schlechte Busanbindung, bis zu 30 min. Wartezeit. Irisches Abendessen (Menu mit 3 Gängen: Hauptmenuwahl: Hahnchen, Fisch auf Püree mit Gemüse, Vorspeise, Nachspeise).",3,2016,07,28
249,Bello se sei fortunato nella camera,"- Camera 327 – piano 1, camera nell’angolo in fondo al corridoio, proprio sopra all’autostrada e quindi a causa di poca insonorizzazione della stessa il rumore nella notte causa fastidio al sonno, MA ANCORA PIU' FASTIDIO danno le porte che dividono i corridoi, che causano un forte rumore tutte le volte che passa una persona e ti fanno sobbalzare!!! Per il resto l’hotel è bello e ben curato, la camera pulita e curata, così come pure il bagno, con la doccia sopra alla vasca da bagno e tenda per riparo ( allagamento assicurato nel bagno).
La cena: come sempre piatto d’ingresso brodo o insalata, servito al tavolo; piatto principale un trancio di trota (cm.8x6) con contorno due patate bollite e verdure cotte da prendere al self-service; tris di dolci (mini pasticcini) servito al tavolo; pane e acqua in tavolo, ordinato 1 pinta di Guinnes. – Il cibo tutto sommato è buono però veramente SCARSO!, da un hotel 4* ci si aspetta ben altro.
La colazione Irlandese buona e abbondante, non aspettatevi di trovare del buon caffè o una buona colazione all'Italiana.",3,2016,07,11
249,Gutes Hotel außerhalb Dublin,"Das Hotel liegt schon ein wenig außerhalb Dublins ist aber mit mehreren Buslinien erreichbar.
Von außen macht das Hotel einen guten Eindruck. Je nach Rezeptionist wird einem auch bei Probleme geholfen. 
Bei den Zimmern kann man Glück oder auch Pech. Man sollte ein Zimmer am Aufzug meiden. Leider sind die Zimmer auch ein wenig hellhörig.
Das Hotel ist sehr groß und man hat je nachdem ein lange Weg zum Ausgang.
Zum Hotel gehört ein Schwimmbad (Achtung: Badekappenpflicht! Eine Badekappe kostet 3€), dass man kostenlos nutzen kann.
Das WLAN ist in allen Zimmern kostenlos und gut.
Die Preise im Restaurant sind teuer (15 Euro aufwärts).
Das Frühstück war bei uns schon im Preis inklusive und ganz in Ordnung.",4,2016,06,14
249,"Großes, betriebsames Hotel","Das Hotel liegt sehr günstig, um mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln nach Dublin zu kommen. Das ist wahrscheinlich auch der Grund für den Veranstalter, dieses Hotel bei einer Irland-Rundreise zweimal anzusteuern, einmal am Ankunftstag und noch einmal zwei Nächte vor der Abreise.

Beim ersten Mal hatten wir ein Zimmer mit Blick auf die Autobahn (der Lärm ist durch gut schließende Fenster erträglich), beim zweiten Mal hatten wir für zwei Nächte das Zimmer vis-a-vis zur Hofseite mit den Parkplätzen (ruhiger).

Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet und sauber: Flachbildfernseher, Coffeemaker, bequeme Betten, genügend Stauraum, Safe.

Beim zweiten Mal wurden wir von Renovierungsarbeiten überrascht. Die Teppiche auf den Fluren waren abgeklebt, die Flurwände wurden mit einer (vermutlich lösungsmittelhaltigen) Farbe gestrichen. Ohne darauf hingewiesen worden zu sein, wurden wir auf unser Zimmer geschickt - durch eine Wolke frischen, feuchten Farbgeruchs (nicht sehr professionell). 

Am Ende einer Rundreise erlahmt so langsam der Widerstand, und wir wollten nicht schon wieder umziehen müssen. Also akzeptierten wir zähneknirschend dieses Manko. 

Das Frühstück war in Ordnung, wenngleich sich dabei bemerkbar machte, dass sehr viele Geschäftsreisende in diesem Hotel wohnten, die es sich zum Ziel gesetzt hatten, alle gleichzeitig aufbrechen zu wollen. 

Parkraum gibt es genug, wenn man nicht zu spät anreist. 

Das Abendessen im Hotel, ein A-la-Carte-Restaurant, war in Ordnung, das Steak wie gewünscht, preislich gerade noch o.k.

Man sollte nicht den etwa zehnminütigen Fußweg zur Bushaltestelle scheuen, denn in Dublin einen Parkplatz zu finden, ist nicht ganz einfach. Auch zahlt es sich aus, ohne Auto zu sein, weil man so wesentlich flexibler ist und auch mal ein Guiness trinken kann.

Etwas vergessen? Kein Problem, das nahe gelegene Einkaufszentrum Liffey Valley ist gut zu Fuß zu erreichen und bietet ein großes, vielseitiges Sortiment (auch Restaurants).

Ein Hinweis für Autofahrer: Wenn Sie vom Flughafen über die M 50 zum Hotel fahren, passieren Sie ein kostenpflichtiges Stück Autobahn. Sie werden zwar drauf hingewiesen, müssen aber wissen, dass Sie bis zum nächsten Abend 20.00 Uhr die Maut dafür unaufgefordert an einer Tankstelle oder mit Kreditkarte im Internet bezahlen müssen (z.Zt. 3,10 Euro). Wenn nicht, werden Sie empfindlich bestraft.

Wir würden dieses Hotel wieder wählen, aber  gleich ein Zimmer zum Innenhof wählen.",3,2016,06,02
249,Buen precio para un hotel en la cara Dublín,"Buen hotel, lo único que no me gusto es que las paradas de autobuses están un poco lejos, de 10 a 15 minutos caminando y como llueva con viento (lo que es normal) es un problema. Por lo demás bien, muy recomendable.",3,2016,03,29

Es gibt 3SAT und ZDF im TV. Kostenloses WLAN hat gut funktioniert.

Von der naheliegenden Autobahn haben wir nichts mitbekommen. Gefrühstückt haben wir dort auch nicht, da wir einen Kühlschrank mit kleiner Küche hatten. Somit haben wir uns selbst versorgt.

249,1. und letzte Station auf Irlandrundreise,"Im Rahmen einer einwöchigen Rundreise haben wir am ersten sowie am sechsten und siebenten Tag hier Station gemacht.
Die doch sehr vielen relativ schlechten Kritiken haben uns vorab zur Besorgnis angeregt.
Aber die Realität sieht anders aus.
Trotz der Größe und des täglichen wechselnden Gästebestandes war der Aufenthalt durchaus als gut anzusehen. Die erste Nacht war das Zimmer an der Autobahnseite, dass war wohl das einzige Handicap. Beim erneuten Aufenthalt war die Unterbringung auf der Innenseite und entsprechend ruhig. Die Zimmer sind zwar nicht mehr ganz neu, aber sehr sauber. Was auch auf die Bäder zutraf.
Bei der zweiten Ankunft waren noch nicht alle ursprünlich geplanten Zimmer fertig. Das Personal hat sehr flexibel reagiert und sofort andere, göleichwertige Zimmer zur Verfügung gestellt. So mussten wir nicht noch lange warten sondern konnten gleich in die Stadt weiterfahren.
Das Frühstück ist absolut o.k.
Hinsichtlich einiger Kritiken anderer Bewerter, dass es in der Nacht teilweise laut auf den Gängen zugeht, liegt unseres Erachtens weinger am Hotel, als an leider immer wieder auftauchenden Touristenrüpel.
Wir würden bei einem Kurzaufenthalt wieder einchecken.",4,2014,10,06

249,für die durchreise ganz o.k.,"Wir waren im August 2014 hier. Wir schließen uns insgesamt eher den negativen Berichten an; jedenfalls kann man diese Berichte und die entsprechende Einschätzung eher nachvollziehen als die ""Lobgesänge"": 
Es ist sehr laut, nicht nur im Speisesaal (viele Kinder), Massenabfertigung, manchmal ist es beim Frühstück so voll, dass man länger auf einen freien Tisch warten muss, was wir sonst noch nie erlebt haben. Das Frühstück aber ist reichhaltig und gut. 
Das Hotel ist  tatsächlich außerhalb gelegen, die gute Busverbindung (10 Minuten Weg) bringt einen in einer guten halben Stunde in die City; aber für das vor dem Hotel geparkte Auto muss man Gebühren zahlen, was wir ebenfalls noch nie erlebt haben und was auf jeden Fall negativ anzumerken ist. 
Man trifft mal auf genervtes, unfreundliches Personal - und manchmal auf freundliches - da spielt sicher die eigene Verfassung auch eine Rolle. 
Das Zimmer war insgesamt o.k.
Wem die Negativpunkte nicht so viel ausmachen oder wer nur gerade auf Durchreise ist, der ist hier nicht schlecht aufgehoben. Wer ein ruhiges, gemütliches Hotel z.B. zum Ausspannen nach einem anstrengenden Stadtbesuch braucht, ist hier falsch.",3,2014,08,18
249,Für die Durchreise ganz OK ;),"Viele Familien mit Kindern, daher etwas lauter aber nicht weiter schlimm...es ist trotz der durchschnittlichen Bewertungen viel Betrieb dort und gerade am Frühstücksbüffet sollte man etwas früher dran sein! Zimmer waren aber sauber und der Parkplatz für 4 € ist günstig. Das Personal war kompetent und freundlich. Für eine Nacht völlig okay!",3,2014,08,06
249,Laut und unfreundlich,Im Restaurant ist es sehr laut: Gemütlich essen und sich unterhalten ist nicht möglich. Kinder rennen durch den Saal und Essensreste werden auf dem Boden verteilt. Auf den Fluren herrscht bis morgens Lärm. Das Personal am Empfang ist unfreundlich und genervt. Nachfragen werden nur wiederwillig beantwortet und die Dame am Empfang hat jedes von mir falsch ausgesprochenes englische Wort korrigiert. Für mich das schlechteste Hotel in Irland.,1,2014,08,05
249,Lautetes Hotel in der Umgebung von Dublin,"Ein sehr lautes Hotel,das Personal ist unfreundlich, das Hotel liegt sehr außerhalb von Dublin. Die Glässer sind schmutzig, sowie auch die Teller und Nachts ist es sehr unruhig.
Ich empfehle dieses Hotel nicht weiter.
",1,2014,08,03
249,"Laut, unfreundlich und ganz anders als auf den Bildern","wenn man sich die Bilder auf der Homepage ansieht erwartet man ja schon so einiges.
In der Empfangshalle bleiben die Erwartungen auch noch erhalten - bis man zum ersten Mal mit dem Personal in Kontakt tritt. Abfertigung wie an der Supermarktkasse - wer nicht sofort antwortet wird mir bösen Blicken und genervtem Seufzen bestraft.
die nächste Überraschung dann das Zimmer, welches sich im Untergeschoss befindet. mit Blick auf den kleinen, aber sehr runtergekommenen Hinterhof + Treppe zur Tiefgarage, die ständig lärmende Leute hinauf und hinunter gehen! um nicht ständig beobachtet zu werden muss man IMMER die Vorhänge zu ziehen. glücklicherweise war sowieso nicht geplant, längere Zeit im Hotel zu bleiben. anmerken möchte ich noch, dass wir das Zimmer online über DerTour gebucht haben und keine Zimmerwahl hatten - wir wussten nicht einmal, dass es Zimmer im Untergeschoss gibt!
Samstagmorgen wacht man um 3 Uhr in der Früh auf, weil oben in der Bar und auf dem Parkplatz laut Party gemacht wird - das Hotelpersonal interessiert das nicht die Bohne. man hat eh die ganze Zeit das Gefühl, dass das Personal einen eher lästig empfindet.
wenn man im Bett liegt fällt einem bei einem Blick an die Decke neben der Wand des angrenzenden Badezimmers auch irgendwann auf, dass da etwas Wasser durch kommt. am Spiegel ist eine große Ecke abgeschlagen, Handtücher sind - auch trotz mehrmaligem Nachfragen - nur Mangelware.
beim Frühstück herrscht absolutes Chaos - Kaffee und Tee sind schneller aus als man laufen kann, der Teppichboden und die Stühle kleben regelrecht vor lauter Essensresten. die Tischchen an den Hochstühlen werden lediglich mit einer Serviette abgeputzt, bevor der Hochstuhl an den nächsten Tisch gebracht wird. die Tische kleben, weil sie nicht richtig gereinigt werden. wer seine Tasse umdreht um etwas ein zugießen sollte vorher einen Blick hinein werfen - sauber ist anders. an den Gläsern für den Saft befinden sich noch Lippenstiftreste! und im gesamten Restaurant war auch nur ein einziger(!) Kellner zu finden, der freundlich und hilfsbereit war - da er noch recht jung war nehme ich an, dass er noch nicht so vom Rest des Mitarbeiterstand beeinflusst wurde.

Fazit:
Einmal und NIE WIEDER!",1,2014,08,02
249,"Großes lautes Hotel, Schlechter Service","das Hotel liegt außerhalb von Dublin und empfiehlt sich nur wenn man einen Mietwagen hat. Es gibt zwar eine Busverbindung in der Nähe jedoch ist das Bussystem in Dublin sehr unübersichtlich und auch das Personal konnte/wollte uns hierzu nicht weiterhelfen, sodass wir die Bushaltestelle selber suchen mussten. Beim Check-In herrschte großer Andrang sodass wir sehr lange warten mussten. Als wir dann unser Zimmer zugewiesen bekamen irrten wir durch das große Hotel auf der Suche nach unserem Zimmer. Nach mehrmaligen Nachfragen erfuhren wir dann, dass wir im Nebengebäude in einem Apartment untergebracht wurden. Dies hatte die Dame am Check-In mit keinem Wort erwähnt. Wir hätten uns dadurch einiges an Zeit für die Zimmersuche erspart. 
Das Frühstück war ok, jedoch aufgrund der vielen Gäste sehr unpersönlich und laut. Geschirr wurde nicht abgeräumt, erst auf Nachfrage erhielten wir Kaffee.
Es gibt mit Sicherheit bessere Hotels in und um Dublin. Wir würden hier nicht mehr übernachten!",2,2014,07,14
249,etwas abgenutzt,"wir haben das Zimmer kurzfristig zu Ostern über das Reisebüro vom Anbieter ITS für 3 Nächte mit Frühstück im Dreibettzimmer zum Preis von 100,-- Euro/Nacht gebucht.
Ein Mietwagen ist von Vorteil, da es ausserhalb von der City direkt am Motorway liegt. 
Positiv, schneller check in, da das Zimmer vorausbezahlt war, es war tatsächlich ein richtiges Einzelbett für die 3. Person vorhanden und kein Beistellbett (was bei der Buchung im Reisebüro leider nicht beantwortet werden konnte). Wir hatten das Zimmer 337, dass wir vorzugsweise über das Treppenhaus erreicht haben, da dort die Luft besser war als in den stickigen endlos langen Gängen. Ein Lift war in den 3 Tagen immer wieder defekt und anscheinend nicht kurzfristig reparabel. Das Zimmer war ausreichend groß, mit Blick auf den Motorway und hatte eine Verbindungstür zum Nebenzimmer, welches glücklicherweise nicht belegt war. Die Minibar ist vorhanden, aber leer, so dass man sich selbst eindecken kann/muss. Das Fenster lässt sich nur einen Spalt nach aussen legen zum Lüften, nachts kann man bei geöffnetem Fenster durch den ständigen Strassenlärm nicht schlafen.
Die Möbel sind teilweise abgenutzt (Bezüge der Stühle, Schrammen an den Holzmöbeln, Bettbezüge haben Löcher) und es gibt ""Flecken"" welcher Art auch immer am Boden, auf der Tagesdecke und an der Bettumrandung. 
Im Bad fehlen die typischen kleinen Giveaways es war jedoch sauber, allerdings funktionierte der Handtuchwechsel nicht wie gewünscht bei 3 Personen. 
Es gab keine Flasche Wasser oder ein frisches Blümchen als nette Willkommensgeste. Das ist auch alles nicht wirklich nötig aber es macht den kleinen Unterschied. 
Die Einrichtung ist modern und durch typisch durchgestylt für ein allerwelts Hotel. 
Es waren viele Familien an diesem Osterwochenende und eine Busreisegruppe im Hotel. Dadurch war es hektisch und sehr laut in den öffentlichen Bereichen. 
Es gibt ein Hallenbad mit Whirlpool, Dampfbad und Sauna (mit Badekleidung), was ich als nicht sonderlich gepflegt empfand. Was noch wichtig ist, nicht die Badekappe zu vergessen, ist dort Plicht, und kostet 3,00 Euro pro Kopf wenn man sie kaufen muss. Auch dürfen ""Kinder"" unter 18 Jahren nur bis 19.00 Uhr dort bleiben ! Erwachsene bis 20.30 Uhr.
Das vorhandene Gym haben wir nicht ausprobiert.
Das Frühstück ist o.k.,es gibt soweit das Übliche.
Das Essen in der KUDOS Bar ist asiatisch, jedoch geschmacklich im nebenan gelegenen Lemongrass Restaurant hat es mir besser geschmeckt. Das Synergie Restaurant haben wir nicht ausprobiert. Auch hier hat die Einrichtung schon deutliche Gebrauchsspuren und sollte mal erneuert werden. Erschrocken hat uns das allgemeine Verhalten der Gäste im Essbereich. Was auf den Boden fällt wird ignoriert und festgetreten. Die Tische sind zugemüllt, das Personal kommt kaum nach. Die Parkgebühren betragen 4,00 Euro/Nacht.
Rund um das Hotel gibt es wenig Schönes zu sehen. Triste Einheitssiedlungen, praktisch kein Ortskern. Man beschränkt sich in direkter Umgebung auf das Hotel selbst oder das nahe Liffey Valley Shopping Center oder die nebenan gelegenen Restaurants ARC und Lemongrass, auch kann man sich mit Getränken in einem Shop dort versorgen.
Der Check out war kurz und bündig, Schlüsselkarten abgeben, keine Nachfrage ob man einen schönen Aufenthalt hatte o.ä.
Alles in allem war das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis zu dieser Reisezeit in Ordnung.",3,2014,04,22
249,Da ritornarci,"Posizione strategica: attaccato alla fermata dell'autobus e a uno dei centri commerciali migliori di Dublino. Perfetto per coppie e famiglie. L'hotel è ampio, il personale cortese. Puntuale il servizio navetta da e per l'aeroporto. Non ho provato la cucina dell'hotel, ma tutti gli altri servizi erano funzionanti e funzionali. Ideale per chi vuole sperimentare la movida irlandese, tornando però in un luogo accogliente e silenzioso.",5,2013,12,06
249,hotel molto comodo,"5 anni fa ho avuto la fortuna di visitare l'incantevole città di Dublino,nella quale riandrei anche 100 volte. ho alloggiato al clarion e mi sono trovata molto bene.
sono molto puliti e ordinati,cibo tipico irlandese e veramente ottimo.
sala congressi enorme",4,2013,08,18
249,"Struttura di buon livello, anche se migliorabile...","L'hotel si trova alle porte di Dublino, la fermata di autobus per la capitale è a circa 10 minuti di cammino a piedi (gli autobus per Dublino sono poi molto frequenti ed impiegano una ventina di minuti per arrivare in centro).
Il personale è disponibile e cortese, anche se potrebbe sforzarsi di più per cercare di capire chi non parla inglese (perchè loro parlano solo inglese!)...
Le camere sono pulite e ben tenute, anche se manca l'aria condizionata (e le finestre si aprono a ribalta con apertura di circa 20 cm., per cui è difficile creare ricambio d'aria).
Internet era disponibile in camera tramite cavo, mentre il wifi era presente (ma scarso) solo nelle aree comuni, però devo dire che durante gli ultimi giorni hanno esteso il wifi a tutta la struttura, per cui si sono ""ripresi"" da questo aspetto.
Abbondante la colazione, ma solo d tipo irlandese (bacon, salsicce, fagioli, pudding, uova strapazzate, formaggi e salumi, pane, yogurt, caffè e tè, poca frutta... ecc.), mancando del tutto la colazione continentale; tanto caffè, del tipo americano!
Interessante e piacevole il centro benessere: palestra, piscina coperta, jacuzzi, sauna e bagno vapore, tutto sempre molto affollato (e non sempre pulitissimo, almeno la sauna)!
Nell'hotel sono presenti un ristorante (Sinergie), dove si mangia bene (con prezzi non proprio nella media...), ed un bar-ristorante asiatico (Kudos), che però non abbiamo frequentato (ma l'abbiamo visto sempre affollato).
Ricapitolando: è un 4 stelle (in realtà direi un 3 e 1/2, non di più), periferico ma in posizione utile per raggiungere facilmente Dublino e l'aeroporto, che offre servizi più che accettabili, ad un prezzo sicuramente interessante (prezzi che magari non si riescono a spuntare -  a parità di condizione - in Dublino).
Voto complessivo: 8-",4,2013,07,31
249,Enorme hotel en las afueras de Dublin,"Es un hotel para ir con auto porque el centro queda a más de 30 minutos en bus.
El edificio es enorme y demasiado concurrido, por lo cual se forman colas para todo: check in, desayuno... Los pasillos son interminables y decíamos que nos hacía falta un GPS para ubicar la habitación. Además a toda hora hay bolsas de residuos, vajilla sucia y demás desperdicios que la gente saca de sus habitaciones y abandona en los pasillos. Da muy feo aspecto
En nuestro caso,como  conseguimos una muy buena oferta sin desayuno,  quedamos conformes , pero a tarifa plana son puntos muy en contra.
Teníamos un departamento con cama gigante, estar comedor, pequeña cocina equipada, un baño completo y mucho espacio. La decoración está un tanto pasada de moda, los televisores son viejos y no tiene aire acondicionado, cosa que con 11 grados de máxima no interesa, pero supongo que la cosa sería distinta con calor.
Es un establecimiento elegido por familias con chicos porque cuenta con pileta y entretenimientos, razón por la cual también lo hace ruidoso y siempre hay una multitud por todas partes.
No es un hotel que hubiésemos elegido y supongo que no volveríamos, sólo si volviera a costar muy barato.",3,2013,06,08
249,Bel ricordo,"Navigando su Tripadvisor mi è saltato all'occhio questo Hotel nel quale sono stata ormai 4 anni fa...ho un bel ricordo della nostra vacanza a Dublino e questo è dovuto anche alla struttura dove abbiamo soggiornato...il personale era accogliente e molto disponibile, le camere spaziose e confortevoli ed è vero che non è centrale ma con l'autobus ci impiegavamo veramente poco ad arrivare al centro! Consigliato!",4,2013,04,28
249,soddisfatta,hotel 4 stelle molto pulito e con personale molto accogliente e disponibile. Unico difetto: sta lontano  dal centro ma quest'ultimo è facilmente raggiungibile con diversi autobus . Nei paraggi c'è un ottimo centro commerciale in cui si compra molto bene...considerando i prezzi altissimi di Dublino,4,2012,09,15
249,Buon rapporto qualità prezzo.,"Ha due strutture il Clarion e il Clarion suite noi abbiamo soggiornato al Clarion. 
Vista la posizione la macchina è quasi indispensabile.
Le camere sono ampie e pulite ma prive di aria condizionata infatti avevamo un ventilatore in dotazione.
Lo staff non ci è apparso molto disponibile. Abbiamo faticato un pò a farci detrarre delle consumazioni che erano state impropriamente caricate su una delle camere del gruppo.
Il parcheggio è a pagamento anche quello esterno e la modalità di pagamento ci ha reso perplessi. Fino a quattro ore il parcheggio è gratuito da 4  a 24 ore si pagano 4€. 
Il problema è che non esiste un ticket che vale per l'intera giornata per cui se durante il giorno si esce più volte c'è il rischio di pagare di più. Noi siamo arrivati alle 13 ed usciti alle 17 per cui 4€ siamo rientrati alle 22 e usciti alle 8 del giorno dopo altri 4€.
Nel complesso considerando che una tripla ci è costata 58€ al giorno il rapporto prezzo convenienza prevale in modo assoluto sia sulla distanza dal centro sia sulle altre pecche.",3,2012,09,06
249,Mittelmäßiges Businesshotel,"Das Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley in Dublin wird von mir regelmäßig besucht, da es für meine Geschäftsreisen ideal liegt. Die Zimmer sind von der Größe und Sauberkeit her ok. Das warme Frühstück ist mittelmäßig. Der Kaffee ist ok, leider ist der Service etwas langsam und es kann schon eine Weile dauern bis nachgelegt wird. Es gibt einen kleinen Indoorpool und einen Fitnessraum, den ich benutze. Die Geräte sind funktionstüchtig. Alles in allem ist das Hotel ok, aber nichts besonderes.",3,2012,03,05
249,empfehlenswertes Hotel,"Das Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley Hotel liegt gut erreichbar am Stadtrand von Dublin, sofern sie ein Auto haben. Das Hotel ist sehr günstig und die Zimmer sind sehr großzügig, z.T. mit 2 getrennten Zimmern und Küchenzeile mit Kühlschrank. Sehr zu empfehlen für die Selbstversorgung. Hallenbad vorhanden und mit Kinder ebenfalls zu empfehlen. Das Personal ist sehr freundliche und hilfsbereit.",4,2011,11,08
249,Ottimo Hotel,"Siamo stati con la mia fidanzata in questo Hotel a fine Settembre per 2 notti.
Offre un bel parcheggio coperto interrato ad un prezzo un pò troppo alto (4€ a giorno) secondo me trattandosi di un hotel molto fuori città dovrebbe offrilo ad un prezzo inferiore.
Il check-in nonostante la prenotazione fatta tramite agenzia è stato molto veloce e ci è stata assegnata una bella camera famigliare (2 camere, 2 letti , cucina e bagno).
Colazione al buffet abbondante e di qualità.
Una nota molto negativa è stata che ci è stata fornita una camera con il condizionatore guasto 
nonostante la presenza dei termosifoni la camera era un pò fredda.",4,2011,09,25
249,affidabile!,con un gruppo molto numeroso il personale è stato paziente disponibile e sempre sorridente. il ristorante a-la carte un pò caro ma di ottima qualità..in sostanza ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo.nonostante sia un pò fuori mano è ben collegato con i mezzi. se tornassi a Dublino lo sceglierei anche per la sua vicinanza con un grande e fornito centro commerciale,4,2011,07,04
249,gutes Businesshotel,"Das Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley  ist ein gutes Businesshotel in nicht allzu großer Entfernung zum Flughafen Dublin. Die Taxifahrt zum Flughafen dauert cirka 20 Minuten (in der Rush Hour wahrscheinlich deutlich länger). Das Personal ist freundlich und das Frühstück würde ich als sehr gut bezeichnen. Das Hotel ist sehr groß, was natürlich eine gewisse Anonymität mit sich bringt.",4,2010,09,10
249,Hotel mediocre in posizione scomodissima per il centro,"L'hotel è situato a più di mezz'ora dal centro cittadino raggiungibile solo con autubus non frequenti , la fermata più vicina dall'hotel dista ben dieci minuti di strada a piedi in zona periferica con attraversamenti pericolosi. Nelle vicinanze un centro commerciale e qualche squallido ristorante.
vivamente sconsigliato per ch deve visitare il centro di Dublino a piedi.
per il resto hotel normale con camere standard non particolarmente belle, abbastanza frequentato quindi anche rumoroso al mattino. pulizia normale. Non c'era la colazione compresa e quando l'abbiamo provata era veramente scadente, il cibo sembrava poco fresco, poco invitante e con poca scelta.",3,2010,08,09
249,etwas außerhalb- aber zu empfehlen,"das Clarion Liffey valley liegt etwas außerhalb von Dublin - aber ist durchaus zu empfehlen. Das Hotel ist relativ neu, schön gestaltet. Der spa Bereich steht den Hotelgästen offen. Die Zimmer sind recht groß und sauber. Die Angestellten sehr hilfsbereit und nett . Restaurant und Bar okay. Nebenan ein Einkaufszentrum mit Kino, sowie eine größere Bar. Bus hält ca 300 Meter vom Hotel entfernt.",4,2010,07,04
249,Auf keine Fall ein 4 Sterne Hotel,"Check- in unmöglich, die Dame brauchte 12 Minuten um mich einzuchecken, sie fand einfach kein Zimmer, dass meinen im Voraus gebuchten Zimmer entsprach. Der Zimmerservice war der schlechteste, den ich jemals in einen Hotel in Irland erlebt hatte. Es wurde das Badezimmer nicht geputzt, keine Tische, nicht einmal gestaubsaugt...nur die Handtücher gewechselt. Am Lift lagen 3 Tage lang abgekaute Apfelstücke, Essensreste und mehrfach stand über 1 Tag Geschirr im Flur herum. restaurant, keine Tischdecken, keine Servietten, Frühstück überkocht, Toast einfach kalt, da auf einem Teller liegend, schmutzige Gläser und Besteck, ich hatte an 3 tagen hintereinander keinen Tee bekommen, ich war entsetzt. das Personal wurde darauf aufmerksam gemacht, keine Entschuldigung und wurden sehr ruppig.  das Hotel liegt direkt an der Autobahn, sehr sehr laut, besonders nachts. Nie wieder, das scheint wohl in der Clarion Kette so üblich zu sein, denn diese Erfahrung mit der Unsauberkeit und unfreundlichen personal hatte ich jetzt schon mehrfach mit Clarion gemacht.",1,2009,08,11
249,Ottimo Hotel,"Albergo che offre una imponenete SPA...piscine fantastiche!
Receptionists veramente cordiali ed eleganti.
Hotel consigliato!",5,2009,07,25
249,Zweckmäßiges gutes Hotel,"Wir waren in einer kleinen Gruppe aus Männern und Frauen unterwegs auf Städtetour durch Irland und Großbritannien. Das Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley ist nur bedingt für Städtereisen zu empfehlen, da es ohne Auto eher schlecht zu erreichen ist, aber es gibt auch einen Hotelbus- der ca. alle halbe Stunde in die Innenstadt fährt.  Die Zimmer verfügen leider über keine Klimaanlage, was im Sommer als etwas störend empfunden werden kann, aber die Zimmer sind sauber.
",5,2008,09,23
249,Hervorragendes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis,"Wir sind mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gefahren und zunächst schien es schrecklich - lange Fahrt, weit draussen, längerer Fussweg im Regen ... Aber der freundliche Empfang, der gute Service und die Tipps des Personal haben schnell alles wettgemacht: Wir konnten früher ins Zimmer (mit Balkon, modern, gut ausgestattet, geräumig), das täglich tipptop sauber gehalten wurde. Alle Fragen und Probleme wurden vom Personal schnell und zuverlässig beantwortet. Erster Tipp war die Bushaltestelle um die Ecke an der Schnellstraße: 5 Linien in 25 Minuten direkt ins Zentrum bis Mitternacht,  Und zum Flughafen waren es dann nur 15 Minuten mit dem Taxi.",5,2008,05,24
249,Muy buen hotel,"El hotel está situado a las afueras de Dublín, dentro del parque industrial y comercial de Liffey Valley, en la N4.
Las instalaciones son muy nuevas y cómodas.
La habitación y el baño grandes, todo muy limpio.
En mi caso fui con amigas y alquilamos un coche y no tuvimos problemas a la hora de encontrarlo ni para movernos por allí.
Está muy bien comunicado, tanto con Dublín, se tarda unos 15 minutos en llegar del hotel al centro, como a otros lugares de interés, puesto que nada más salir del hotel por la N4 de puede tomar la M50, circunvalación que rodea Dublín y desde ahí tomar uno de los diferentes ramales en cualquier dirección.
Enfrente del hotel hay una cafetería-restaurante-discoteca-tienda 24 horas. El desayuno allí es más barato que en hotel y también muy bueno y el sitio es muy agradable.
Dos rotondas más abajo, pasado los concesionarios de coches, también hay un gran centro comercial con tiendas, ocio, restaurantes,…",4,2008,04,25
249,Für uns perfekt...,"Mein Lebensgefährte und ich waren im Clarion Liffey Valley in Dublin für 3 Nächte untergebracht von Freitag bis Montag num dort meinen Geburtstag zu verbringen. Wir waren auf der Suche nach einem einigermaßen günstigen Hotel und waren dafür auch generell bereit etwas außerhalb von Dublin zu suchen. Da ist uns dann das Clarion Hotel Liffey Valley aufgefallen. Und ich muss sagen, es war für uns die optimale Wahl.

Wie schon in vielen anderen Reviews hier beschrieben gibt es in der Nähe ein Einkaufzentrum in dem man auch frühstücken kann. Das Früchstück im Hotel selbst haben wir nicht getestet, da es uns zu teuer war. Auf den Zimemmern wird umsonst Tee und Kaffee aus Tüten angeboten, ein Wasserkocher ist vorhanden, ebenso ein Bügeleiesen und ein Föhn.

Man hat die Wahl zwischen 2 Bushaltestellen, eine in der Nähe des Einkaufszentrums und eine hinter dem Hotel die Straße runter. Hier sind wir immer eingestiegen, das sind ungefähr 5-10 Minuten zu Fuß, also keine weite Strecke. Die Busse fahren dort sehr regelmäßg und halten alle in der Stadtmitte von Dublin. Wir haben nach den Empfehlungen hier auch nie die Busline die direkt vor dem Einkaufszentrum abfährt genommen, da die ja angeblich nicht der Hit sein soll, kamen aber mit dem 25A oder 25er Bus innerhalb von ca. 30 Minuten in die Stadtmitte.

Das Hotel selbst ist sehr sauber. Im Genesatz zu den Beurteilungen hier, fand ich das Personal sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich, wir hatten sogar beim einchecken eine Deutsche erwischt. Hier können wir uns auch nicht beschweren. Das einzige was uns auffiel, war das Personal im Restaurant, das nicht ganz so fit war, aber trotzdem freundlich.

Auch den ""Wellnessbereich"" haben wir getestet und waren vollauf mit unserer Wahl zufrieden - trotz Badekappenpflicht.

Die Gegend um das Hotel herum schaut zwar nicht gerade sonderlich hübsch aus, aber uns hat das nicht gestört.

Auch das Einkaufzentrum war einen Besuch wert, hier findet man auch Restaurants etc.

Wir würden hier auf jedne Fall wieder übernachten, wenn wir wieder mal nach Dublin kommen sollten. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen, die Stadt selbst und als perfekte Ergänzung für dieses schöne Wochenende das Clarion Liffey Valley.",4,2007,02,08
