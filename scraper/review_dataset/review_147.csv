147,Great hotel,"We selected this hotel due to its amazing location and design. It obviously sits within the Luxury set hotels of London and it deserves its position amongst them.

We usually stay somewhere else in London but would seriously consider changing this to be our new favourite hotel.

location - Great
Room - Spacious for London (We had a deluxe)
Amenities - Good (Mitchel and Peach not my favourite, but free mini bar is great touch)
Sleep quality - Amazing, room was so quiet and we were overlooking the Lion King theatre.

We will be back",5,2024,10,13
147,A One off,"One Aldwych is an absolute One off, and One of a kind. As a hotel, it's classy, clean and cultured. The rooms are interior designed for comfort and luxury, the staff are kind and efficient. The art is contemporary and inspiring. The pool is UV cleaned (no bitter chlorine stinging your eyes) and the gym small but well stocked. The mini bar is a treat with the added novelty of quality wine in a can. Sorry to gush superlatives, but you'll love this hotel. I cannot rate it highly enough. It's also in the centre of town and ideal for a stroll back from an event. Thank you to the team at One Aldwych.",5,2023,02,07
147,Best hotel in hotel,"I have been coming to this hotel for 20 years. The quality of the service, rooms, facilities, and food is world class. You can not beat its location. A boutique hotel with every service you can want. It is amazing that One A is as good today (I think even better) than when it first opened. We would not stay anywhere else in London.  Tip. Book the studio bridge suite with views over Waterloo bridge and definitely have cocktails in the bar in front of the amazing flower arrangements.",5,2024,09,30
147,Wonderful stay,"We just had an amazing experience, we were welcomed like king and queen, amazing upgrade, the staff was just fabulous, truly an amazing experience ",5,2024,09,27
147,An absolute delight,"We loved everything about our stay here. It is a class act. It has a feel about it which makes you want to be there. We had occasion to stay here twice within a month (for 3 days each) and were upgraded on each occasion.  Both rooms were interesting, modern and spacious.  One of them had two toilets which was such a luxury. The stocked fridge (complimentary) was generous and included wine.  The towels were fluffy and absorbent.  Plenty of fresh flowers in the room. Breakfast (served to your table) was first class.  Loved the yogurt and poached pears. The location is excellent (on the edge of Covent Garden).  But it was the service that impressed us most. They treat you like royalty. Very helpful in trying to sort out a couple of issues.",5,2024,09,27
147,Gluten Free Paradise,"I absolutely adored this hotel - from the location to the quiet clean rooms it’s worth the splurge. Also, if you are gluten free the choices for in-room dining (and of course the restaurant on site, Indigo) are fabulous. Everyone was so nice and the spa (which I used twice) was great. I think it says something about a business when many of the workers there have been around for decades. Also Dyson hair dryers in the rooms were a nice touch! 

The only cons: beds are a bit hard, the area in front of the hotel is quite busy and the entrance is right on a bus lane so it can be challenging to grab a taxi. I wasn’t a huge fan of their soaps and shampoos in room. They are big on sustainability but give those little single plastic shampoo bottles, which seemed odd.",5,2024,09,20
147,Britain's crown jewel,"Friendly, hospitable staff. Concierge Alan was fantastic, set my family up with Manchester United tickets. Manager Mohammad provides first class service. Outstanding gluten free food accommodations, walkability also superior. Top notch amenities, all staff amazing at every level including bell hops and housekeeping. My kids rate it 7 out of  5 stars.",5,2024,09,13
147,What a Hotel,"The location of the hotel is incredible and makes getting around town very easy. 

Our suite was amazing, the attention to detail in the suite was impressive and the suite was spotless and finished to a very high standard. 

The view of the Strand was a delight too. 

The staff are a credit to the Hotel. Martha on reception was a lovely helpful young lady, Anobal in Room service was an extreamly polite helpful young man too and Nicholas saved the day with his shoe repairing skills!

I couldnt recommend this hotel enough and will definately be returning very shortly.",5,2024,09,11
147,Exceeded our expectations!,"One Aldwych Hotel offers an exceptional experience that truly exceeded every expectation. The customer service was outstanding, with staff providing excellent communication and going above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay. Special recognition goes to Tiago Macedo and Julia Reichenberger, who were particularly outstanding in their service. Their professionalism and attention to detail made a significant difference in our experience. Although I don't know all the names, other front desk and room service staff were equally impressive, handling every request promptly and efficiently. The rooms were immaculate, with daily cleaning that maintained a spotless environment. Situated in a prime location, the hotel is perfect for those looking to explore shopping, dining, and theater options, all within easy reach. A stay at One Aldwych Hotel is nothing short of perfection.",5,2024,09,02
147,Our stay in London,Outstanding clean and well organized property. All of the workers were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,09,01

147,Perfect Boutique Hotel!,"Recently visited London and loved our stay at One Aldwych! The hotel is decorated with beautiful fresh florals and really interesting original art. The rooms are so well appointed - Frette linens, large windows with lots of natural light and all the amenities one would hope for in a hotel such as heated bathroom floors, complimentary mini bar and draperies which open at the touch of a button! Everything was spotlessly clean- excellent housekeeping! Finally, everyone we encountered at One Aldwych was so welcoming, pleasant and professional- we will definitely return!",5,2024,08,27
147,Stay at One Aldwych,"This is an absolutely beautiful property with attention to detail.  Our stay was absolutely amazing with the staff going above and beyond.  I highly recommend this property , as well as the location.  Thanks for an amazing stay!",5,2024,08,27
147,All around wonderful,"Wonderful hotel in a great location. The manager and staff were terrific. We had two connecting rooms— perfect for a family. For anyone with celiac disease or who has anyone in their group who cannot eat gluten, this hotel is next level. Gluten free snacks in the room, a completely gluten free amazing restaurant, and a bar that will fix you whatever drink you need plus safe and delicious gluten free food— including fish and chips! Hope to return again soon!",5,2024,08,22
147,6 days,"My granddaughter and I had a wonderful stay with friends at One Aldwych. 
We found the location perfect for us as first time visitors to London. I can’t say enough about the doormen, with whom we interacted with multiple times each day! So cheerful, kind and helpful.
Everyone in our group enjoyed the Willy Wonka Tea.
Thanks for a wonderful stay. ",5,2024,08,21
147,Great stay for our anniversary trip to London,"We really enjoyed our visit and the room was lovely - the concierge team helped us with great restaurant choices and was able to arrange flowers and champagne for the room - we were travelling with our son so two rooms and everyone had a great time- very pretty, clean rooms with nice bathrooms and great location.",5,2024,08,21
147,Our favourite place to stay!,"Staying at One Aldwych is a total delight. ALL the staff are charming and helpful. The food is delicious and it is in an interesting, fun and safe part of London. My husband and I love staying in the hotel, and always look forward to our return.",5,2024,08,19
147,Amazing property and staff,We had a wonderful time staying at One Aldwych. It was in such a bustling area and most of what we wanted to see and do was a short walk away. You could not hear ANYTHING from outside once you entered the hotel which we really appreciated. The staff was incredible and very helpful and kind. The hotel and room was very clean and the housekeepers were amazing at providing us with snacks and water nightly throughout the stay. They also have a nice gym that we utilized throughout the stay. Thank you One Aldwych for making our honeymoon one to remember. We would recommend and definitely come back! ,5,2024,08,19
147,"Very good hotel, conveniently located in Covent Garden area","Rooms are quite new, with bright and modern interiors. Very good, a la carte breakfast. Quite big swimming pool. Very nice bar area. Great location in central London, especially to explore lovely Covent Garden area or family musicals (like Lion King or Frozen).",5,2024,08,16
147,Exactly as nice as it claims to be (which is rare surprise),"Exactly as advertised, this is a very clean, comfortable, well appointed hotel. If you like full service (and don't mind the cost), this is a great place. I stayed with my notoriously picky spouse, and she was sad to leave. If anything, the levels of service might be a little over the top. Like, could a guy just get a bucket of ice and take it to his room on his own? No, it must be summoned with room service, which might prompt another tip. So keep a lot of pound coins and fivers around.

I've seen complaints about neighborhood noise, and I'll mention two things about that. One: If you choose to stay right in the heart of the theater and party district for obnoxiously wealthy youth, it's gonna be noisy. Two: I just closed the windows and found that all but the loudest Italian sports cars and the bleating sirens chasing them down Strand were pretty much silenced, allowing good sleep on the very nice mattress and very good bedding. They aren't skimping on anything here.",5,2024,08,12
147,Disappointing for our little pup,"Small friendly hotel, limited access with my dog.
We enjoyed our stay but won’t stay again , our room had lots of street noise. It is well placed for the West End , as expected it is very busy outside the hotel . Advertised as a dog friendly hotel, we found ourselves having to stay away from the main area with our tiny Maltipoo dog and had the only option to stay in the library away from the main bar and restaurant. Not dog friendly! This was disappointing considering the cost and for this reason we won’t stay again.",4,2024,08,01
147,What a Fantastic Place,"First of all the staff were amazing, efficient and extremely friendly. We stayed in the Waterloo Suite and it did not disappoint. Amazing views and a delight to stay in. We will be back very soon. ",5,2024,08,01
147,A spontaneous stay at the One,"My mum and me stayed here due to recent flight cancellations. So it was not a stay we have planed in advance. Nevertheless, I was so happy we had the chance to stay here, as One Aldwych is really a special hotel.

The first thing you notice is how tasteful this place is and the love to the detail in every area. Rooms are in my opinion of a good size and are beautifully furnished and decorated. All interior is of high quality and seems new. A great feature is that lights in the room and bathroom can be dimmed. The combination of hotel and art gallery makes it absolutely unique, but it still feels very cozy like home, not like a museum. 

The staff members are professional and super friendly. We received a very warm welcome. I read a lot of positive reviews about this place before and still was blown away upon arrival, it just exceeded my expectations in many ways. 

Though the hotel is located on a busy road in the direct proximity of the theatre district, it is very peaceful inside which is quite surprising. I am very sensitive to noise, but enjoyed here very good sleep at night and rest also during the day. 

The in-room dining is on the level of an excellent high class restaurant. Great respect for the ideas and quality the chef and his kitchen staff deliver to the guest. Beside other great dishes, I had here the best chips & fish in my life.

This hotel will be one of my top choices when returning to this beautiful city.",5,2024,07,28
147,What a wonderful stay,"I have never stayed anywhere with such incredible service. My friend and I were treated like queens. The facilities were beautiful the spa treatments, exceptional, thank you so much for all your care and kindness. ",5,2024,07,27
147,Comfort and convenience,"I've stayed at One Aldwych many times.  It's an all around win for me.  Attentiveness and friendliness of staff, comfort and cleanliness of rooms and the location is convenient to everything in the city.",5,2024,07,23
147,"BEAUTIFUL, LUXURY, LOCATION","5 Stars isn’t enough! LOVE this BEAUTIFUL hotel to stay, eat and enjoy a drink! It’s in the perimeter of Covent Garden and theaters! Love that they cater an ALL Celiac diet! It’s beautiful, elegance, luxury and customer friendly services are spectacular!",5,2024,07,19
147,Nice place,Beautiful hotel the staff is great ….  The only issue was that the staff at Indigo was extremely poor and constantly forgetting items.  The other issue was that in front of the hotel is a tour bus loading area.  So there were constant hordes of people waiting for their bus.  Other than those 2 issues everything was great.,4,2024,07,19
147,Family London Stay,"Such a beautiful homely stay for our 9 nights.  The ability to have a 3 bedroom (2 rooms interconnecting to the main suite which had a master) was perfect for our family of 5 (19,17,12).  The housekeepers were exceptional and the little touches like the new Monopoly board game, books to read and London snap made it extra special.",5,2024,07,11
147,An excellent hotel! One of London's finest,"One Aldwych is an all-round fabulous hotel. I've visited on many occasions and it keeps on getting better. The team are very friendly, hospitable and can't do enough to ensure you have a lovely stay. The Lobby Bar is a wonderful spot for an evening drink or daytime bite - and Indigo serves delicious food. The location too is unmatched, right in the heart of all the happenings of Covent Garden. Highly recommend a stay at One Aldwych!",5,2024,07,04
147,Superb,"Everything was ‘just right’. 
Staff friendly and helpful. 
Room beautifully finished and furnished.
 Of course in a super location
It really was a great pleasure to stay at One Aldwych",5,2024,06,24
147,Fantastic Hotel,"Our stay at One Adwych was fantastic. The room was spotless and extremely comfortable and each detail was clearly well-planned. For example, each bedside table had UK, EU, and US outlets, so no need for chargers, the bathroom floor was heated, and the shower kept the previous temperature setting and didn't ever let water onto the bathroom floor (like so many hotel showers). The room was dead quiet despite being in the center of a busy intersection - no noise from the street or other rooms. The staff went above and beyond, including having our room ready several hours early so we could check-in right after our flight. Amazing hotel and well worth the money.",5,2024,06,22
147,A Gem in London,"We stayed at One Aldwych for 3 nights. From check in to check out it was an extraordinary experience. The room was spacious with an incredible bathroom, 2 sinks, separate bath tub and shower.  In room amenities, robes, toiletries, etc. were top of the line. The beds were comfortable and the hotel is remarkably quiet despite its location in the center of the West End.  It is convenient to plays, the Thames and many of the historical sites.  Food and beverage were excellent.  We had room service deliver breakfast and it was absolutely delicious with a gorgeous presentation. The mini bar was well stocked with complimentary snacks. We felt like the staff were genuinely interested in making our stay great and took personal satisfaction with our well being.  It was so nice to return to the hotel after a hectic day to relax and be spoiled. We highly recommend  this incredible hotel.",5,2024,06,21
147,Definitely a fine hotel,"The One Aldwych certainly deserves the fine reputation it's cultivated. It's luxurious, well-located, and well-staffed.

Its staff helped me with a large number of requests, though I only stayed there for one night. They were perfectly helpful and courteous, always there when I needed them. They were a great help coordinating my visit, which was a bit complicated due to the short layover I had in London.

The room was very well-appointed with all modern conveniences, comfortable, and cozy. 

The hotel is very well located, at the edge of London's theatre district, but also with access to the river, to escape the hustle and bustle a bit if need be. I walked easily to the show I booked. 

Anyone should be happy to stay at the One Aldwych. My thanks to them for all the help they gave me, and the comfortable refuge during a busy visit.",5,2024,06,12
147,Excellent Hotel but serious lightning issue,"Excellent hotel and exellent services. We had issues with our initial room (105) which had an AC issue but the hotel was incredibly efficient and fixed our AC and then upgraded us to a luxuary room which was very nice. However, the sun woke us up at 5AM on the two days we stayed there because the curtain does not stop the light. THis should be improved. The bar and the drinks re amazing. Location is amazing. Pool is amazing.",4,2024,06,11
147,"Perfect, perfect, perfect!","This is the find of the century! We have stayed in many top hotels in London, but decided to try this one and we are so glad we did. The hotel, rooms, service, stafff are just perfect. We loved the artistic decor and were delighted that the staff could tell us about the sculpute and artists. We have found ‘our’ hotel for London and have aready booked for our next stay. It is independent and unique, and filled us with joy. Thank you!",5,2024,06,09
147,An amazing staff helps a battered up guest on a Saturday night,"Often you learn most about people and a place in their worst moments, which somehow often are your worst moments as well.

Last evening around 8pm I fell on the stairs leading down to the Southbank from Waterloo bridge.  The tumble could have killed me, and I was very conscious of that, but as it were I ended banged up neck to toe with a bleeding lip that wouldn’t stop.  My son helped me back to the hotel and then had to leave.  I felt out of sorts but had no idea how badly I was until the events that unfolded over the next thirty minutes.

I didn’t want to take Advil or such for fear of exacerbating bleeding that continued well after then fall.  So I chose wine, not medicine I know but alcohol does dull pain. So I tried to order a glass through room service but the person on the other end of the line had no idea what wine I was talking about. I hung up, and that should have clued me that my nerves had been affected by the fall, my second in five months and by far the worst. So I went down to ask the bar, and none of them seemed to understand.  Was it language? My American accent?  Couldn’t they see I wasn’t quite right? You can imagine.  No matter, people kept trying to understand what I wanted, which turned out to be an uncommon order that was on room service but not bar menu.  And had been difficult to explain in the wonderful hotel restaurant  — Indigo — the night before.  Finally, we settled on something as I realized I was not only badly banged up, but barely lucid and certainly not my civil self. 

They brought it to my room and the very nice young man who did so could tell I was distressed.  He asked if I was okay and so I described what happened.  He wished me health and left and moments later two managers appeared at the door saying that the young man had told them what happened and could they help. Doctor? Ice pack? Bandages? I accepted the ice pack and they returned minutes later, just after my jittery hand had knocked the glass of red wine onto the carpet and white den wall.  With that, my world caved in. Nothing left to do but cry and admit being a mess. They put me at ease, sent a nice man who got the stain completely out of the carpet and dulled the wall evidence with a soft scrub while chatting amicably.  And the young man returned with a complimentary glass of wine in a water glass I could not possibly tip over.  Made me laugh, gratefully.

Every hotel earns its strips in moments like these.  One Aldwych, thanks to a patient and caring staff earned them that evening in my book.",5,2024,06,09
147,Superb!,"A wonderful place! Great location in London- close to Covent Gardens, theatre district, Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, St Paul’s, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace- we were able to walk everywhere! Our suite was beautiful, the staff was superb! You will not regret staying here!",5,2024,06,03
147,Very disappointing stay,"We know quite well London as we lived in this vibing city for almost 11 years. As we had to go back to this capital city we decided to ""experiment"" The One Aldwych and our journey went beyond our expectations.
For example, you leave your room in the morning and when you come back in the afternoon at around 16:30, your room is still not clean and tidy. 
The room was fully prepaid and when you checkout the invoice is fulfilled with expenses which don't belong to you and obviously that you never signed for. What a disappointment.",3,2024,05,29
147,Birthday Celebration,"Booked a room for one night and dinner at Indigo to celebrate my birthday. The service from the moment we stepped through the doors was exceptional. The room was beautiful and exceeded our expectations. We had the 6 course tasting menu which was excellent. The courses were nicely paced, giving us time to chat and enjoy the wine between courses. I’ve stayed in many hotels in London and would have no hesitation in saying that this was the best experience I’ve ever had and made my birthday extra special. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2024,05,27
147,Fantastic,"I would highly recommend to anyone staying at One Aldwych. The rooms are beautiful, and I wanted to take the bed home with me as had the best night sleep ever. ,the pool and spa is lovely…...  The staff are fantastic and cannot do enough to make your stay memorable.",5,2024,05,21
147,Excellent,"Excellent service and attention to detail. Clean rooms, spacious closet, heated bathroom floors and lovely welcoming treats.",5,2024,05,17
147,#1 Best hotel ever,"You can't beat One Aldwych. The welcome, the room, the breakfast, everything is immaculate. When my partner arrived after running the London Marathon, the gents on the door rallied to ask him how he was. We repaired to our room, quite literally, and when he needed a special cream, the concierge made sure it was ordered and sent to our room after a fruitless search in nearby stores. 

A forgotten hairbrush? No problem. Housekeeping got me one, right away. No need to look like a cave woman who'd staggered through a tear in the time/space continuum. Nothing is ever too much trouble. The whole place smells of cleanness. The smiles are plentiful on either side of the customer/staff equation. Everything runs well - it's the marathon of hotels, going the extra mile for the extra smile. Thank you to everyone who made our stay a pleasure, yet again. ",5,2024,05,08
147,Mixed,"Stunning rooms, beautiful building and convenient location, however...

- V mixed levels of service between staff
- Head Concierge rude and dismissive both to me and my friends when asking for simple requests, but also to his team (said to one of the junior staff 'can't you see I'm in the middle of something' - loud enough for me to hear half-way across the lobby!
- Overnight room service no-existent, not good enough for close to a grand a night!",2,2024,05,06
147,Even better than I hoped,"There are many wonderful hotels in London. We chose this hotel because of the gluten-free friendly restaurant. It just makes it SO much easier to know our GF family member can find good food right at our home base. But this hotel was so much more than that! Gorgeous decor, meticulous attention to beauty and order, friendly and helpful staff, creative drinks (both 0% alcohol and regular) in the bar, and SUCH good food in the restaurant! There is a no chlorine pool and spa downstairs which we didn’t get to experience, but want to. I am so eager to return to One Aldwych. It was an oasis of peace and rest in the middle of busy London. ",5,2024,04,25
147,An Oasis in the Heart of London,"Staying at One Aldwych was an absolute delight for our family's first trip to London!  From the moment we stepped into the elegant lobby, we felt welcomed and pampered. The location couldn't have been better, right in the heart of Covent Garden, making it easy to explore the city.  We walked to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, through Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, and up and down the Strand.  It was fabulous to be in a city again!  

The pool, gym, and spa are superb.  Our teenager was especially impressed with the modern amenities and stylish decor of the hotel room. The comfortable beds were a welcome sight after a 10 hour flight.  The attention to detail in the room's design along with the quality snacks and drinks made it feel like a luxurious home away from home.

The hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. They were always on hand to offer recommendations for restaurants and attractions, and their warmth and hospitality truly enhanced our experience.  They made several last minute dinner reservations for us and followed up to make sure we enjoyed the restaurants.  

I would give this place 10 stars if I could!  We have already recommended One Aldwych to our friends traveling to London over the summer.  We will definitely return next year!",5,2024,04,24
147,One of the most wonderful hotel experiences in London,"One Aldwych is perfectly positioned for a fun-filled visit of London. While the location is excellent, the spacious rooms and suites, excellent service and wonderful food and beverage in the hotel lobby bar that makes it a perfect home-from-home. The beds are comfy, bathrooms are lovely and well equipped, and the rooms are bright and airy. We can't wait to return!",5,2024,04,24
147,My Wifes birthday weekend @ One Aldwych,"The hotel is centrally positioned ns ideal for those visiting the nearby Covent Garden with is bars, restaurants and theatre's. We had tickets to the opera that started at 12:00 so we dropped our luggage of early. We were warmly greeted at the door and show through to the receptionist who again provided a warm welcome. We explained the situation and she advised our luggage would be waiting in our room upon our return. 

When we did return after watching the fabulous Madam Butterfly at the Royal OH and enjoying a scumdidlyumptions afternoon tea at Charlie at chocolate factory conveniently located in the hotel.
We were again greeted by the doorman but this time by name asking how our day was going so far.

The receptionist advised our room was not only ready and kindly showed us the way after telling us a little about the hotel it's history and where everything could be located. Once in our room the receptionist explained where everything was and how it all worked. The room was perfect, spacious light and well equipped with everything you could need for a short stay in a hotel.

This is a truly magnificent 5 star hotel. on or way out to breakfast we were greeted by one of the cleaning staff that not only said hello but introduced herself and shook our hands. We finished off our Sunday with breakfast in Covent garden but returned for my wife to have a facial and for me to use the gym. In the Gym I met one of One Aldwych's first customers and he too asked how my stay was and if everything was to my liking, We didn't use the pool just so we have an excuse to go back....!",5,2024,04,21
147,A very nice London Hotel,"Nice Hotel. Interesting High Tea. Helpful concierge. Close to Covent Gardens and some Theaters. A busy hotel during Wimbledon but it didn't feel crowded. 
Close walk to the Tube station. 
Very beautiful floral arrangements. Nice location.",4,2024,04,09
147,Special birthday celebration,"We have often had cocktails at One Aldwych in their vibrant lobby bar full of atmosphere and a great variety of drinks.  To celebrate a family birthday we decided have dinner at the Indigo Restaurant and stay overnight in one of the Corner suites.  The whole experience was one of comfort, luxury and excellent service from all staff from start to finish.  We shall repeat the experience.  ",5,2024,03,29
147,Great customer service,"Fantastic customer service, Nothing was too much trouble Laila is a true asset to the company.  She explained how the afternoon tea worked excellently. She was kind and thoughtful. Love how the charlie and the chocolate factory themed area was set up and it was great fun.",5,2024,03,23
147,The perfect place to stay in central London!,"One Aldwych is amazing!  We considered using a travel agent for our week-long trip to London but decided to use the concierge at our hotel instead.  Stephan was perfectly detailed and hooked us up with the best tour guide we could have ever hoped for.  She led us around the city for three straight days. We saw everything we wanted to, and more.  We can't talk highly enough about One Aldwych and especially Dani.  Her energy was invigorating.  Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her knowledge was enlightening.  She knew exactly where to stand to get the best view or photo.  She knew exactly where to be to see the sights up close.  We felt like we had a deep dive master's degree of London history at a college level in just three days.  So very impressed and highly recommend!   The hotel is in the absolute perfect location in central London between all the tourist attractions and surrounded by great restaurants in the theatre district.  On one side of the building is The Lion King and the other is Mami Mia.  Everything is within walking distance.  The rooms are made up twice a day and the minibar is complementary; including snacks, drinks, and of course tea.  This was very helpful to help keep us hydrated from our days of touring.  The on site restaurant is perfect for breakfast, but there are also cute cafe's, coffee, and pastry shops on the same block too.  The gym is quite large for a boutique hotel like this and is in the world-class spa and pool area located in the basement.  The entire staff goes out of their way to make you feel right at home.  They arraigned pickup and drop off to the airport for us so we never had to stress about anything.   This is the place to stay in London!",5,2024,03,17
147,A great stay at One Aldwych,"Stayed once again at One Aldwych and simply had a wonderful 5 day stay. The total experience from the moment we arrived to our departure was exceptional. Beautiful accommodations, ideal location and a fabulous staff… particularly, the staff - friendly and singularly focused on exceeding guest’s expectations. 

My only regret is that we did not find this hotel prior to 2022.",5,2024,03,15
147,Outstanding in Every Way,"From the elegant, well-appointed room to the attentive bar staff and excellent location, what’s not to love about One Aldwych? The flowers are stunning, the gym and the spa are expansive, and what really makes the difference is the friendly staff. My only regret is having not discovered this gorgeous home away from home earlier.",5,2024,03,09
147,Stylish hotel and great customer service,"A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff.
A warm welcome and an early check in was a great start to our stay.
The hotel was very stylish with wonderful art throughout the property.
Our room was very comfortable.
Breakfast in the morning was one of the best I’ve ever had .
Really friendly staff made our stay very special.",5,2024,03,06
147,Lovely hotel but rooms are poor and overpriced,"Booked online via Booking.com for a Delux Room for myself and my daughter for Saturday night (yesterday). Cost £940. Pictures shown on website showed a large room with seating area sofas etc and all the expected room norms that a 5 star hotel should have. I was walked to the room by the lovely well mannered receptionist and I was immediately hard pushed to see the difference in size and design to a Premiere Inn room as seen on current TV ads.
I immediately queried the room as an error but was told that this was what was advertised -,but they would see what they could do.
I heard nothing and put up with it as we had plans booked for that day and evening.
Upon check out (today) the head receptionist said they tried to contact me to arrange a better room, but they were not able to contact me. I had no missed calls or emails.
I advised them that the standard of the room (Room 414) was £200-300/night maximum standard and again reiterated it was on a par with a standard Premier Inn room.
The staff in general and especially at breakfast and the standard of breakfast and the health club/hotel is excellent but the cost of the rooms for what you get is poor and Booking.com pictures are misleading.
I was offered as a discount the discretionary service charge which pushed me to write the review as this took the proverbial ‘piss.’
Needless to say this is a lovely hotel, but a rip off on the price of the rooms - and not worth it, and if you want to to spoil yourself/family on a plush £1000/night room in a 5 star hotel- you will be really disappointed at the One Aldwych.

147,Amazing boutique  5 star hotel!,"Traveled here for my first trip to LONDON with my friend.   Our Room was a Studio Suite which is very roomy with a beautiful view being that it is a corner room with 3 large windows.  The amenities and attention to detail were nice: Greeted with a personalized welcome note with fruits and truffles,  Fresh flowers in the room, a minibar full of complimentary drinks and snacks that are refreshed daily,  bathrobe and slippers, a DYSON hair dryer,  outlets for both US and European plugs so I didn’t need my adapter, heated bathroom floors and plenty of storage space.  

I would HIGHLY recommend One Aldwych if you  intend to stay in Covent Garden.   The Customer Service is top notch.  The location is located in the theater/dinning district along the STRAND.  Very close to public transport and walking distance to many restaurants, cafes and attractions.   I had a wonderful time and enjoyed my stay.  I will definitely be back!",5,2024,02,24
147,Wedding night stay,We enjoyed a luxurious stay in a beautiful suite with fantastic views down to Waterloo Bridge.  One Aldwych provided stellar service and comfort to make us feel really special.  We could have happily spent a week exploring the suite and the hotel alone!,5,2024,02,16
147,Everything perfect,"Wonderful hotel. We loved the fact that many of them staff remembered our name, and it was a lovely touch Nicoleta, the maid, took the time to chat to us. Beautiful room and we loved the inclusive minibar. Amenities well thought through and resulted in a very comfortable stay. Really enjoyed the breakfast, perfectly cooked and again served by a professional, friendly and basically amazing team. Thanks everyone! We really hope to be back.",5,2024,02,15
147,Liked the package,"Thanks for upgrading us to a suite (room 300).  Great space. And great that room service breakfast, minibar and newspapers were included. Will definitely stay with you again. Pricing was a bit higher than we normally spend, but it was worth it. ",5,2024,02,10
147,Short wonderful stay,Beautiful hotel on a perfect location. Covent Garden is amazing and the hotel is a relaxing island to explore the neighbourhood. Beautiful swimming pool with under water music. We definitely will go back.,5,2024,02,03
147,Mid week theatre trip,"I had a very enjoyable overnight stay.  The service was impeccable in the lobby bar and my breakfast was great. 

I will hopefully return again later on this year for another theatre visit as the location is ideal. ",5,2024,01,31
147,Incredible stay,"We had an incredible stay at One Aldwych. What made it so good was the amazing service - everyone we came across were so friendly and professional. The room was so quiet considering the busy London Road outside, had everything we needed in the room and lots of lovely touches to make it feel special. We were staying for a celebration and we would definitely stay again. Thank you so much!! ",5,2024,01,27
147,Best Hotel in town,"The Hotel is perfectly situated. The Lobby Bar is the perfect place to drink a delicious cocktail made by real Bartenders, the floral decorations are magnificent and what can we say about the personnal; From the doorman, to the bar, to the reception, the concierges, the housekeeping, the restaurant,  the management... so kind and attentive. We feel like home",5,2024,01,14
147,Anniversary in London,"Global stay was excellent, with upgrade, cake in the room.
The entire hotel team was efficient and friendly.
We had breakfast, lunch and went to the bar with success.
This hotel is well located, close to main theatres and shopes.
",5,2024,01,13
147,A week at One Aldwyck,"Great hotel and fantastic location! Staff was great rooms very well done. Overall would stay there again for sure if going back to London. Only improvement would be the mattresses. Very stiff and pillows flatten out so I did not sleep well. For such a great place I feel like they could provide more comfortable mattress and pillows.
Really enjoyed the place as a whole and thought the lobby was much nicer the Waldorf. ",5,2024,01,09
147,Once In a Lifetime,This hotel is a true gem! Every aspect of the experience from start to finish went above and beyond our expectations! We were so lucky to be able to find this hotel for our engagement in our favorite city! We cannot wait to be back in London and stay here again! ,5,2024,01,08
147,Great Hotel in Count Garden,"This was our first stay at One Aldwych but it won't be our last. We stayed for 5 nights to enjoy New Years Eve in London. The location is excellent with easy walking to the shops in Covent Garden, and several tube stations within a 10 minute walk.

We stayed in the Dome Suite, which was spectacular. The room was very large, with a living area/kitchen, walk-in dressing room, large bath, and the main bedroom with a fireplace. The ceiling of the bedroom was domed and the room was very nice. The kitchen had a refrigerator with minbar which was included with the room and refreshed daily.

The pool and fitness center/spa were great. The fitness center has a wide array of weights, weight machines, cardio machines and a Peloton bike. The pool has a giant screen of marine life over the end of the room. The pool could have been a little warmer for our tastes. There were also 2 saunas.

The main restaurant, Indigo, is where we ate on New Years Eve. The were 2 selections for each course of dinner, and everything we had was very good. The service was also outstanding even though the restaurant was full.

Perhaps our favorite place is the Lobby Bar. With lots of seating, an amazing selection of spirits and cocktails, and extremely attentive service we spent time there every day of our stay.

We are already planning our next trip to London, and we will definitely be staying here again.

",5,2024,01,08
147,Wedding stay,"Although we stay regularly at the hotel, as this stay was for our wedding, we upgraded our usual choice of room to one of the hotel's signature suites.  The suite was beautiful and had a wonderful view of Waterloo Bridge.  As ever, the room was spotless.  Service was consistently excellent, particularly when they had to move quickly to get us checked out of the hotel because of a demonstration taking place outside so that we could get to the airport in good time.   A wonderful stay - we felt thoroughly looked after.",5,2024,01,03
147,convenient and elegant,"My wife and I traveled to London for Christmas for a vacation. We wanted a hotel that was in a walkable neighborhood where we could enjoy christmas festivities. One Aldwych was perfect. Location is excellent close to Covent Garden, pubs, restaurants and theaters. Staff is friendly and super helpful. Its a small boutique hotel so the service and personal attention are impeccible. The rooms are small by US standards however they are well appointed, and the sheets and beds are VERY comfortable. The pool and steam room are a welcome refuge from the cold outside. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2024,01,01
147,Amazing stay,Our stay was perfect and we plan on staying again. Janine was amazing and gave us an impromptu tour of Covent Garden that didn't disappoint. We stayed over Christmas and the hotel was not only festive but bustling with cheer from the staff. We didn't want to leave. Breakfast was amazing!,5,2023,12,31
147,Perfection in a great location,"We have just spent 8 wonderful nights at One Aldwych visiting our family in the UK from our home in Australia.

From start to finish the experience was flawless.  Every single member of staff was a pleasure to deal with; from the chaps on the door to the reception staff, to the bar servers and in the restaurant.

Housekeeping was fantastic - whatever time of day we left our room we came back to the room having been cleaned.

Another big plus for us was the 24 hour gym which is large and well equipped.  It was so nice to be able to exercise when suited us (which was regularly super early in the morning when jet lag woke us up)

We had  one of the Aldwych Corner Suites, which was large and very well equipped.  A lovely  surprise was a large, beautifully decorated, real Christmas Tree in our living area.

We were a little worried about noise due to the location but despite being right where Aldwych meets the Strand our room was really quiet and we slept well.  There are so many fantastic restaurants on the doorstep of the hotel - we would highly recommend the Savoy Grill where we had 2 amazing lunches and this was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

We will be coming back to London next year and we will definitely be back to our new London home.",5,2023,12,30
147,Wonderfull time in London,"We had a perfect city trip in London and the one aldwych was top notch. The beuatifull bar, the food, the people, the room. Everything was perfect. The location can’t be better. We will come back one day.

Also the good vibe is mesmerising. Wonderfull",5,2023,12,24
147,"Very welcoming, friendly staff. ","We only went for drinks at One Aldwych one evening (for a cup of tea) but I felt like writing a review because of how welcoming and attentive I thought the staff were. They were friendly and helpful, brought us complementary water, olives and crackers immediately and treated us no differently to those who were in there ordering expensive cocktails. The waiter who waited on us made the experience with his friendly manner, making me want to visit One Aldwych again soon. ",5,2023,12,20
147,Nice,"Lovely hotel, service was great, beautifully decorated. Just 4/5 from me as storage in the room was lacking to the extent we lived mostly out of our suitcase for a 4 night stay. A single wardrobe and open shelving that was ceiling height so hard to reach the top shelves. We had lots planned to do in London so location was great. Amazing swimming pool and nice sauna. It was as expected expensive for food and drink, nonetheless a nice stay. ",4,2023,12,15
147,What five stars in London should fee like,"This brand has been part of my story for decades now. This is what five stars in London should feel like. Every detail is deeply considered. The staff team are immaculate in manners and appearance. The restaurants and bars echo the brand promise...and deliver. Style and grace abounds and it somehow changes and offers different points of core interest every visit, remaining consistently interesting even when, as with this visit, we've been away for several years.",5,2023,12,15
147,Luxury in London,"Beautiful property with excellent service. The breakfast is outstanding. Bar area, gorgeous. Perfect location. I would recommend for a couples get away. Theater right around the corner. I would suggest afternoon tea at a different location. ",5,2023,12,13
147,A superb GF menu and dining experience at the bar,"We visited One Aldwych for the very first time and were delighted with our experience. Everything from the service, the food and the cocktails menu is superb. This place has really got it right. You might pay a premium but it’s absolutely worth it. I’m already dreaming to go back for the Wonka afternoon tea. Thank you One Aldwych ",5,2023,12,12
147,A hidden gem in the heart of Covent Garden with the BEST team!,"I've always wanted to stay the night at One Aldwych and finally, last week, I did! What an experience. From entering the iconic building, to interacting with staff in the bar (love the new cocktail menu), to being checked-in and shown to our room. Your team always delivers. I didn't get a chance to have a swim or use the gym so I feel like there will HAVE to be a Part 2 to my review. A special mention for the incredible Christmas decorations (your florist is incredible)... watching the video to seeing them for myself, just brilliant. ",5,2023,12,05
147,Fantastic!,"This hotel is fantastic! Everything from the service to the food was great. The hotel room was spacious and so comfortable, it felt like home. I don't think the location can get any better. We look forward to returning someday!",5,2023,12,02
147,Aldwych Bliss,"This place has it all, amazing staff & service, immaculately clean, food is faultless & Location.. you can’t get much better. 

The rooms are as quiet as they can be located on a busy road, some noise can be heard but you have to expect in this location. You get some much more for your money here vs other high end hotels in the area. We will be back 100%! ",5,2023,11,27
147,Brilliant stay in London,"Everything about this hotel reminds me of home. The staff, the food, the
location. We couldn't imagine staying anyplace else. The room is cozy with an area to sit and relax. The bathroom is lovely. 
Thank you for making our vacation brilliant!
",5,2023,11,19
147,Perfection!,"One Aldwych is a true 5* luxury experience. I am in love with this beautiful hotel. The staff are so kind and treat you very well. All of our hotel meals were outstanding. We loved the bar, drinks were excellent. The room is heaven. There are so many extra luxuries in the room including a complimentary mini-bar, plush seating and many mirrors (for us ladies) that make for such a nice experience. The room itself is gorgeously decorated. The bed was quite comfortable. We had a lovely view. The bathroom is amazing. I don’t usually take baths in hotels but this one I couldn’t pass up. The shower was also fabulous. Everything is so clean. The gym, pool and common rooms were also outstanding. Location is the best for visiting London, so close to theatres and Covent Garden. I hope to return for a much longer visit.",5,2023,11,15
147,Excellent in every respect,"We spent an 8-day vacation at this hotel and it was first-rate in every respect. We had a lovely, immaculate corner suite, which was well-cared-for several times each day by very courteous staff. The staff at all the desks and at the door were professional, friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we made our flight home after learning there were traffic disruptions in central London. I've stayed at most of London's best hotels over the years and this was by far the best, with rates, while expensive, more reasonable than the other 5-star hotels. The location is excellent for transportation, dining and theater. ",5,2023,11,04
147,Best Hotel we've ever stayed at in our many visits to London over the years!,"This hotel has the nicest employees, is immaculate and when they say items in your room bar/snack area are free and will be refilled, they mean more than daily, if necessary.  We stay at many 5 star hotels that offer 'free' snacks, wine, beer, sodas, etc. but they rarely refill them unless we ask.  We usually stay for a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 10 preferring a longer stay.  It's much easier to unpack everything only once and use the hotel as your focal point.  The rooms at One Aldwych are amazingly large particularly for a major city.  The location couldn't be better - plays and restaurants everywhere, many within walking distance or a short taxi ride.  The hotel's Indigo restaurant served delicious breakfasts and the dinners are fine dining.  The Lobby Bar is relaxing and comfortable, we had drinks there every night and I always picked something different from their interesting menu.  We will definitely go back to this hotel on our next visit to London.  (No need to try any others - including the ME which we stayed in several years back and is right across the street, but honestly doesn't compare.)  Additionally, the concierge desk felt like old friends hailing taxis for us and asking about our day.  Very pleasant experience all the way around! I don't often leave reviews only when very bad and very good and obviously this is the latter.  ",5,2023,11,02
147,Tina Turner,"everything in this hotel is absolutely perfect.
thanks to all the staff who are absolutely professional and very kind.
absolutely fantastic breakfast,
the rooms decorated with excellent taste and comfortable.
the exceptionally adequate spa with everything you needthank you all",5,2023,11,02
147,Stunning hotel ,"Just back from an amazing stay at One Aldwych, what a fabulous hotel! Great location especially if you’re seeing a show in the West End. 
The level of customer service from everyone we met was faultless, everything was just so smooth, it would be difficult to pick one out from the team and the room, oh my goodness it was beautiful and so quiet, you can forget you’re in the heart of London. Can’t wait to return! ",5,2023,10,22
147,"Great Hotel, Great Location","For my first visit to London I'm quite certain we could not have picked a better location, and overall I HIGHLY recommend One Aldwych.

So, why not 5 stars?  A couple of little things. Following our second night, and after our room was serviced when we got back to our room one of the bathrobes was missing in action, as was one of our make-up remover washcloths (a grey washcloth so that the make up isn't as noticeable).  Not that big of a deal and we were rushed, so did without the robe as we had to get out to dinner. However the next morning I did make a point of mentioning the missing robe, and asked for it to be replaced (it was our last nights stay).  Room was cleaned but the robe (nor the washcloth) ever found its way back.

Not a huge issue, but a little inconvenience.

My other issue with the hotel was that for the price you pay, complimentary morning coffee/tea service would be nice.  I was quite surprised to find that when I asked for coffee I was charged I believe 6 pounds.  

I may very well stay again at One Aldwych.  Overall the service was absolutely lovely, they have Dyson blow dryers in the room, the rooms themselves look very well taken care of, and the bar is also a wonderful place to have a cocktail before heading out for the evening.",4,2023,10,21
147,Business Trip,First time at One Aldwych and very impressed with the high level of service and quality of rooms/bathrooms/breakfast. The pool and steam/sauna facilities are also excellent. Will definitely return on our next visit to London.,5,2023,10,17
147,Luxurious and Wonderful,"This hotel is outstanding! The customer service is amazing, the staff are there for whatever you may need and do everything with a smile!
Our room was absolutely beautiful! It was immaculate. We were shown to our room by the lovely gentleman at the front desk. We were greeted in our room with a sweet welcome note and amazing hand crafted chocolates. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and had luxurious bedding. The fridge was stocked and included with your room as was a snack drawer filled with yummy local snacks.
Hotel is in the perfect location to everything from broadway shows to cafes and restaurants, as well as local attractions.
Restaurants in the hotel were great. The hotel also has a beautiful pool and steam room and gym with everything you need.
I highly recommend this hotel andwill definitely be back!",5,2023,10,09
147,A hidden gem on the Strand,"This boutique hotel had a great location in Covent Gardens. Located at one end of the Strand, it was also located right by the theater district, restaurants,  and hop on hop off buses. The front desk, back office (who handled all our email and tour questions prior to arriving) and staff in general was very attentive. It was one of the few hotels with twin beds in a room large enough to comfortably accommodate my brother and myself. Breakfast had lots of options, therefore I would recommend not taking the B&B breakfast, but rather ordering it from the menu a la carte. We also liked the lobby bar where they had more options than the listed small bites, just ask (for example club sandwiches and kids menu), the drinks were also really good. Often after a long day we just plopped down and eat there instead of the dining room. This was my eleventh time to London and I would stay at this hotel again. ",5,2023,10,09
147,The perfect hotel!,"My daughter and her boyfriend got engaged at this beautiful hotel on Saturday. As a family, we stayed here a couple of years back and were incredibly impressed by the service; in addition to the fabulous Indigo restaurant (my daughter’s favourite as she is a Coeliac!), inside the hotel, it was an obvious choice for the proposal to happen! 

My Son-in-law was assisted by the hotel’s wonderful Events Co-ordinator, Selina, who worked so hard to ensure they had the best experience. She communicated with him throughout the whole planning process and ensured that everything he wanted she provided and more! The suite (a complimentary upgrade), was decorated beautifully with balloons, candles and rose petals and my daughter was absolutely blown away! They were also treated to Champagne and cocktails. Everyone in the hotel seemed to be aware that it was a special night for them and treated them accordingly. 
It was a night they will remember forever and everything about the hotel from the wonderful ambiance, the attention to details, the luxurious rooms to the fantastic staff who bend over backwards to be welcoming and accommodating all contributed to it.",5,2023,10,04
147,A Wonder of the World,"Often a place will disappoint on a second or third visit.  One Aldwych did not, for the third time. Details remained looked after. Rooms had nice fresh flowers and great lighting. Staff still willing to go the extra mile and friendly to boot. I love that the bar closes to the public at 10pm but a resident can get served 24 hours a day, with the front desk playing bartender after bar staff departs around midnight.  The gym is excellent. Can’t complain about a thing. Liked it so much I could have stayed in all day and left London to itself.",5,2023,10,02
147,We came for the food and loved the hotel!,"Both my wife and I are Gluten and Dairy free, when we found out from a friend that all the food at one Aldwych was Gluten and Dairy Free - we decided to stay at the hotel.  Wow - what a find! We stayed in a Deluxe Bedroom and it was perfect.  The King bed was not too soft and not too hard. The room was well thought out with every item we needed for a multi-day stay.  The Convent garden location meant all the theater we were seeing was only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel.  Service was awesome. I needed something from Amazon, the Concierge team ordered it from Amazon UK and had it delivered to my room.  

Indigo, the main restaurant, where we had Breakfast and Dinner was fantastic. To be able to order anything on the menu and not have to worry about it containing Gluten or Dairy was a dream. We had Fish & Chips twice, it was so good. The Pea soup - wow!  And my favorite the Chocolate Cheesecake.  Service was impeccable - the staff esp Leroy and Ana - remembered our selections from each meal and were super attentive.  Indigo was so good we changed our plans and had every dinner of our trip at the restaurant.  Our daughter (who is also Gluten and Diary Free) was in London before us and also loved Indigo and ended up eating all their meals at the restaurant even though they were staying in a different hotel.  The food and service is that good. I wish I could give Indigo and the Chef 10 stars.

Highly recommend both the hotel and the food.  We will be staying here in all our future trips to London!
",5,2023,09,30
147,My new favorite place to stay in London,"One Aldwych is an amazing property! The amenities and service exceeded all expectations. My partner and I enjoyed a luxurious romantic getaway in the heart of London. Pool could be a little warmer but the sauna, steam room and main cocktail bar were terrific. The housekeeping service and complimentary mini bar were amazing. As were the heated floors and towel warmers! Such lovely touches!",5,2023,09,27
147,Disappointing Customer Service,For a premier hotel property the concierge/porter service was sub-par. No assistance in calling restaurants but told to do so on our own. Really poor quality customer service. we have traveled all over the world and expect a baseline level of customer service which was not demonstrated by any of the staff. ,3,2023,09,23
147,Absolute Perfection,"I recently spent 4 wonderful nights at One Aldywch. I loved everything about this hotel. From the welcoming staff (Hannah and Michele outstanding) to the room, the food, the location and the gym- all incredible. The pool is a sight! It was the perfect home base for our london trip and I couldn't have been happier. Every person we met who worked there was so sweet, smiling and helpful. ",5,2023,09,17
147,Wonderful Hotel In Every Aspect,"One Aldwych is a beautiful hotel with impeccable service. Upon arrival you are greeted curbside and enter a beautiful lobby bar/restaurant with absolutely gorgeous decor.  The pictures are accurate but do not do it justice. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the complimentary mini bar was well stocked.  The beds are very comfortable and there is spacious closet space.  It was so nice to come back 'home' after our days out in London.  The service was absolutely fantastic.  Everyone was very friendly, helpful and made us feel so welcome.  It really is service above and beyond and makes all the difference when you have hundreds of hotels to choose from.  Also, the close proximity to many tube stations and its location in Covent Garden made it very convenient.  Everything is basically at your doorstep.  On my next trip to London this will definitely be my hotel of choice.",5,2023,09,15
147,Amazing stay,"Everything was perfect - the staff is really helpful and nice (special thanks to Nicoletta). 
The hotel is ideally located. 
The room was spacious and really clean. 
We loved the small attentions we got. 
We would definitely recommend the hotel. 
Also, great cocktails and good music! Thank you to the musicians!",5,2023,08,30
147,"Wonderful hotel, but communication needs improvement","We just finished a fabulous stay at this beautiful hotel. The windows have excellent sound proofing and significantly reduce street noise. Internally the hotel was also quite quiet (other than the pipes oftentimes banging when the water ran such as when someone showered). I loved that the window opened, yet it seems safe for young children. The sofa was comfy with a clean, cozy throw blanket and we really enjoyed having a real kettle with a small bottle of fresh milk for tea. The complementary beverages and snacks in room were much needed for our family of five (we had to get two rooms), they were good quality and yes the tinned wine was surprisingly good. What did not meet my expectations was  the communication. First: the hotel emailed us ~48 hours before check in to state that there would be street construction from 8pm-5am in the immediately surrounding streets for two of our four night stay. The hotel failed to respond to my three emails asking if the noise was anticipated to be too excessive to allow us to sleep (they responded to other issues in the email, but not that, so I know they got the emails). When I raised it at check in the clerk said she'd ""ask her colleague"" and get back to me, but we never heard a word. Fortunately the construction didn't seem to materialize, so we were fine, but we were worried at the prospect of having to move our three children to another hotel in the middle of the night due to the fact that the hotel wouldn't answer our question. Second: at check in the clerk quote me a higher total than I had reserved. When I asked her to explain the difference she scrutinized her monitor and said it was ""probably a deposit for incidentals"" and it would not actually be charged upon check out unless we damaged the room or something. But she clearly wasn't certain. Then when we checked out the hotel handed me a bill for ~90 pounds per night higher than we were reserved. When I asked for an explanation the clerk didn't seem to understand what my concern was, but fortunately another clerk stepped in and said it was ""likely"" the ""discretionary service fee"". When I asked her to explain, she said it was a service fee to help pay the staff at the hotel. When I said that I had a quote that did not include this fee in the total nor make any mention of it at all, she then said that she could remove some or all of the fee if I requested it. I do not believe that the hospitality industry builds trust with clients by asking us to supplement staff salary in such a manner rather than just charging a higher room rate. I understand the clerk was doing her job, but this was not a pleasant parting experience with the hotel. Third: at check in the clerk didn't give us details about the restaurant, the pool or the ""library"" among other things. Nor were there any details in the room; we had to go on line to learn about the hotel amenities. I should say that all the staff were very pleasant, they just didn't seem to always understand everything that they should be doing, and at this price point guests expect staff to know what they are doing, and to communicate it well with guests. To my mind, that is a failure of management rather than staff. The communication problems dropped my review from a five star to a four star.",4,2023,08,17
147,From the moment we entered we were welcomed with a smile and service that was top class.,"We arrived in a taxi and two doorman came out to collect our bags and greeted us with smiles and showed us into the reception area.  After being booked in the receptionist showed us to our rooms and guided us around the room, showed us the facilities and how to use the lights etc. 
we were upgraded to a twin deluxe room which was amazing, sofa and large TV with lots of channels even sports too.  The beds we so comfortable too.  We went out for the evening and came back and had cocktails at the bar - again the staff were so friendly and really made us welcome. 
As we arrived late after a show the kitchens were closed but we called for a takeaway and the door staff brought this up to our room.  Amazing
We had breakfast and this was wonderful too.  
Could fault any part of our stay at all - just want to come back now.
thankyou for an amazing time.  
 

Thank you for such a wonderful time - we will be back

147,"Excellent hotel, will come back next time","Location is good, few mins walk from convert garden.  Room is clean and design is amazing.  Especially like the lighting in the room, much lighter than some usual old style hotels which normally very dark.   Service is excellent and staff are helpful. Afternoon tea is also amazing.  Nothing to complaint.",5,2023,08,05
147,Perfect stay !,"The whole experience was perfect, we have already book to stay again , my new home when i am in London, you would have to go a long way to find a better hotel, every member of staff was friendly and could not do enough to make us feel comfortable. ",5,2023,07,29
147,Amazing Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We had a wonderful stay here.  The property is located in a perfect location, literally steps to Covent Garden and within a 15-20 minute walk of all of the major sights like Big Ben, London Eye, Borough Market, Buckingham Palace, etc...The rooms are so luxurious and quiet, the staff is so well trained, it was a wonderful end to our two week European adventures!",5,2023,07,21
147,Great stay and service,We recently stayed at One Aldwych and can't speak highly enough of the staff and facilities. The staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough to assist you in your every need. The hotel itself is in an excellent location and the rooms and facilities are second to none. ,5,2023,07,21
147,Great stay,Great stay and great location. Everything was of top standard. From the welcoming and effortless check in process the hotel was off to a great start. A truly 5 star hotel - one which doesn’t use Covid or Brexit as an excuse to cut service like most of its competitors have done in recent years,5,2023,07,10
147,"Ideal Location, Gorgeous Hotel, Great Service","We've visited London many times, and though we'd had drinks at One Aldwych in the past, this was our first overnight stay at the hotel. We were there for the first 5 nights of July (a very busy time) but from check-in to housekeeping and room service the hotel handled everything beautifully.

When we arrived, our room was almost ready so after Welligton at the front desk checked us in and porters took our bags, we were ushered into the Library: a quiet room with comfortable chairs, some books, and a selection of newspapers, where we were offered a choice of hot drinks (both of us chose English Breakfast tea) which was served with some  chocolate biscuits.

From there, we went up to our room on the 4th floor of the hotel. We had a comfortable king-sized bed, a bathroom with a shower (no bathtub - we'd made no requests regarding bathrooms), and blackout-curtains that opened and closed electronically. As we were jetlagged, we appreciated the option for a darkened room during the day.  

The room was very quiet at all times despite the large windows and the hotel's location on the Strand (a busy thoroughfare with cars, buses and pedestrians traveling in all directions at all times of day).

Also, we were grateful for temperature control (it was a cool, damp week), the fact that we had full control of the lights (including a reading light for each of us) and that the room has many US-compatible electrical sockets, so we didn't need to use electrical converters to charge our devices

The room included a mini-bar (soft drinks, milk, wine & beer in a fridge in the wall), a drawer containing chocolate, gummy candy, crisps, and cookies, plus coffee and tea (and coffe and tea cups, saucers and spoons, all of which was replenished the next day if we ate, drank, or used something.

In general, it is a comfortable, welcoming place to stay, with a beautiful gym & spa, and excellent room-service: in addition to the breakfast menu, there's an afternoon & evening menu, some of which is available  until 11pm, some until 12:30am, and a few items are available all night. 

The hotel is right in the West End (""theatreland"", as it's called on some signs), a short walk from Covent Garden, convenient to several Tube stops and to many public bus lines (there is also a ""hop on, hop off"" bus for tourists right near the hotel's entrance).

In general, the staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. We will certainly stay there again.

147,Excellent sevice,My adult daughter and myself stayed for a week in early June. The staff was just amazing and helpful. One of us had an allergy to the pillows and they changed all the bedding was just in case. The recommendations made by the concierge were perfect the bar and the bartenders also went a beyond. They made for a lovely stay,5,2023,07,04

Very clean , great staff , the rooms are great 
Thanks you ",5,2023,06,27
147,"Amazing hotel, impeccable service","Truly exceptional hotel. Great location, well designed rooms, extremely comfortable beds and pillows.

What makes the property so special, however, is the truly outstanding service level. Every member of staff, from the waiters in the bars and restaurants to the front desk team to the housekeeping staff, went out of their way for us. Not only was not request too small, but they anticipated our needs to a level I have never seen before.

As an example, my son ended up getting sick and had to stay in his room for a few days. The hotel staff heard about this after we ordered room service for him, and on their own initiative sent him some ginger tea. They also inquired after him every time we saw them. It was really wonderful (in a bad situation).

Another example, in the bar/cafe on the ground level. On our first night, we went early with the kids. We ordered a light meal, and noted that one of us has a peanut allergy. A few days later, we're back having an evening tea and one of the servers brings olives and says she has sent out for some chips because they normally bring nuts but she remembers we have an allergy. These are small things but they add up to a wonderful stay.

This is my third visit to One Aldwych, the first with my family, and we'll definitely be back.",5,2023,06,27
147,Another great stay at One Aldwych,"Once again, a perfect stay at One Aldwych. My room was immaculate, the location in Covent Garden is convenient, the hotel staff are accommodating, and the Lobby Bar is a great place for a drink with top notch gin selection. I can’t wait to return.",5,2023,06,12
147,Very helpful doorman,We were visiting town a group of friends we got lost and this friendly guy offered to help us his name was raz he said he works for the hotel onealdwych. he got us a taxi and make sure we've got to our train destination safely and on time and gave us extra bit of tip for directions as well which went a long way we are so pleased with him. thank you so much,5,2023,06,09
147,Fantastic stay,"Everything from checking in to the room, bar and breakfast the following morning were excellent.
All the staff we met were highly professional and courteous.
We would highly recommend staying here if having a trip to London.",5,2023,06,09
147,Made my 25th with my friends such a lovely experience 11/10,"I couldn’t recommend this place highly enough, the staff or so lovely, and I came with my friends for my birthday and the staff made sure we were comfortable and happy and laughing throughout. Would recommend to anyone looking for a beautiful, sophisticated bar to relax and enjoy a beautifully made cocktail!

147,Amazing kindness and efficiency!!,"I am deeply grateful to what the hotel did for me;
finding my wallet left in the safe after check-out and delivered to St Pancras Station, just in time for my train to Paris!!
What amazing kindness and efficiency!!!
Our fondness for the One Aldwych Hotel shot up to the peak!!!
All staff members at the hotel were extremely kind!!",5,2023,06,01
147,Perfect hotel in great location,"One Aldwych is is a beautiful hotel in Covent Garden that lives up to your every expectation. Stayed in a deluxe bedroom, which was the perfect size for 1-2 people. Spa was great, as was the restaurant and bar. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.",5,2023,05,28
147,Always a delight,"One Aldwych never ceases to surprise and delight us. Incredible Service, amazing food, gluten and dairy free restaurant Indigo is always a joy. Beautiful and comfortable rooms with high quality linens and amenities. ",5,2023,05,24
147,Well deserved good reputation!,"I was tipped off by a London insider about this place.  I usually stay at the Ritz or the Savoy.  No regrets giving the Boutique Hotel a try -- Had to change rooms because of technical issues but I have traveled enough and these things happen.  The service as top notch -- The Bed was smaller than expected, even for a London Hotel, but the room was nice and very very clean!  Great Location and in a hip part of London!",5,2023,05,21
147,Five Stars Aren't Enough,"One Aldwych is a superlative hotel in every respect.  Start with the location.  It’s within easy walking distance of the National Gallery, British Museum, Courtauld Gallery, dozens of West End theaters, and scores of restaurants.  The Royal Opera House is only a couple of blocks away.

The hotel occupies a grand 1907 structure that was once a newspaper headquarters.  The interior has been thoroughly redone in modern style, original artwork everywhere.  The Lobby Bar is spectacular — a huge, light-filled two-story space with a mountain of flowers at the center.

We splurged on a classic suite.  It was spacious, with good light, abundant storage space, three sinks and two toilets.  The décor, featuring paneled walls painted an alluring grey-blue, was stunning.  This suite was expensive, but we felt we got our money’s worth.

We had breakfast every morning in the Indigo Restaurant, which offered a wide selection of tasty dishes.  The quality of their fresh mixed berries amazed us.  We also had a pre-theater dinner one night at the Indigo.  Though time-constrained, this too was enjoyable, 
",5,2023,05,18
147,Great London Stay,"We loved our seven-night stay at the One Aldwych Hotel.  All the staff was friendly, courteous and professional.  We looked forward to evening refreshments in the ground floor bar and to chat with its staff.  The corner suite was impeccable.  Everything was well thought out in the room down to the location of light switches and the walk-through closet.  I cannot express how immaculate the room was maintained and the daily service staff did an above and beyond job.   The hotel's location is superb and within walking distance to London’s many historical and entertainment sites.  We will definitely be back.  Cheers!!",5,2023,05,16
147,Gem in the heart of Covent Garden,"Absolutely stylish and spotless.
The staff was out of this world.

I would only wish the lobby bar menu was extended by some more sophisticated proposals like those that can be found in Indigo restaurant.",5,2023,05,12
147,Awesome,"There’s absolutely nothing to fault with this hotel. Everything is superb. We have been many times over the years, but this is the first since the full refurbishment of the entire property. Just wow! It’s just so perfect in every way.",5,2023,05,10
147,Excellent,"Excellent sleep qualitiy.
Rooms are very clean.
Staff were extremely polite.
It was not clear, if the minibar was for free-perhaps my English wasn't good enough.
The bath was lovely and the beds were very comfortable.
Only the service charge of 5% was not clear, when we booked via booking.com.
We enjoyed our time in London.",5,2023,05,08
147,Beautiful and wonderful service ,Beautiful hotel and ambiance! If you are Celiac they cater to our gluten-free options! The food are expensive and the drinks are as well! I enjoyed it because I’m celiac and was celebrating an early birthday celebration!,5,2023,05,07
147,We didn’t want to leave!,"We can’t recommend this beautiful hotel enough. Everything about One Aldwych is incredible, especially the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. 
The whole hotel is immaculate. The rooms are stunning and top quality. 
Staying here was a real treat for us and sometimes it’s nerve wracking wondering if it will actually live up to previous reviews when it’s your turn to visit, but it was beyond everything we could have asked for. 
We ate in the Indigo restaurant too and loved every course. Again, the staff were amazing and are a real credit to the hotel. 
We really didn’t want to leave! 
Cannot wait to return (somewhen hopefully soon!)",5,2023,04,29
147,Best hotel in the best location in London,"I have been staying at One A since it first opened in the 90’s. The location, quality of service, accommodations, and amenities are second to none. I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience at One Aldwych.  Highly Recommended. Stay here once and I guarantee you are hooked for life.",5,2023,04,28
147,It’s still the one,"We have stayed here many times and it has never disappointed us. This time we came for a break after a family bereavement, to build ourselves up again. It was nice to be cuddled again by One Aldwych.
The rooms are so clean, fresh and comfortable. We slept very well. Breakfast in the room is a luxury we love to indulge in, and it is always a delight here. Whether you want a traditional English breakfast, or a continental breakfast, or American-style waffles, you can be sure of friendly service and excellent food.
The lobby bar is also a great place to relax. We sometimes go off-piste in our cocktail orders and the staff here are never fazed. One of us ordered a Maiden’s Prayer. It wasn’t just not on the menu, but the staff hadn’t heard of it but were eager to learn the recipe. Waiting staff Yulia and bartender Phil delivered a perfect cocktail just as we ordered. Nicely done.
Thank you again, One Aldwych.",5,2023,04,28
147,"Great hotel, but don't book the Classic Suite if you're traveling with kids","Beautiful hotel. Very welcoming staff. I love that the mini-bar is included (but you sure do pay for it). Great tea, snack, and beverage selection. Great location. It was very easy to get around Covent Garden. The toiletries were lovely. A few little things. I booked the Classic Suite and I missed that the Classic Suites only have queens. I have never been in a suite with only a queen bed before. Also the pull out bed for the little one was rock hard so the little one refused to sleep there. While the queen bed would have been fine, fitting two adults and a small child into a queen bed because the pull out bed was so uncomfortable, was not fine. They need to add a mattress topper, especially for the price we paid. Also, they advertise for families that, ""Extra beds and cots are available, as well as touches to delight the little ones including mini bathrobes, slippers and a selection of games and treats."" Even though I specifically noted that we were traveling with a young child, only the mini bathrobe and slippers were in the room. Maybe we needed to call and ask for the games and treats? It was a bit disappointing not to have it already in the room. If you're traveling alone, for business, or as a couple, definitely stay there. As a family, I would not stay in the classic suite again with only a queen bed and a rock hard pull out couch. ",4,2023,04,23
147,The Best 5 star lux in London,"We stay regularly at 5 star hotels and One Aldwych is the best in London, we loved the décor the amazing flowers everywhere and especially the staff from the moment we arrived were so friendly and helpful

The gentlemen at breakfast were fantastic both courteous and friendly. 

My wife had a treatment in the spa this morning and she hasn’t stopped raving about it!",5,2023,04,21
147,Best hotel stay ever!,"We travel quite a bit both in the US and Europe and have never enjoyed a stay this much. The location is perfect, within a short walk of Covent Garden and major theaters, and yet the rooms are whisper quiet. They are beautifully appointed with understated good taste. Our rooms were cleaned daily with great efficiency and we were never wanting for the complimentary snacks that were replaced as we used them. The breakfast room service was flawless and we even received a handwritten note and special “treat” when one day breakfast was 10 minutes late! Our server Roggio was pleasant and thoughtful. In the Lobby Bar and Indigo Restaurant we had the same flawless service with staff remembering our preferred drinks and providing a high level of attentiveness without being overbearing. Special thanks to our waiter. Aldrich. We also enjoyed our visit to the fitness room and wish we had had time for the beautiful pool. Can’t wait to return next year!!",5,2023,04,18
147,Great Stay,We booked One Aldwych for 4 nights as we were visiting family and friends in London.  After our 4th night we decided to extend our stay for another 7 nights as we felt so comfortable in the hotel.  We stayed in the Waterloo Suite which was stunning and we had the connecting classic suite for our 20 year old son.  We had a great stay and we will definitely book this hotel next time we are back in London.,5,2023,04,10
147,Extraordinary doesn’t capture it. Beyond five star.,"I’ve stayed a lot of places in my 60+ years but no place like this. Saying the service is incredible doesn’t capture it. Unbelievable, maybe gets closer.  Everyone who works here goes well beyond the extra mile, and always smiling.  My wife, for instance, eats gluten-free. She mentioned this as an aside to the woman who brought us breakfast, including a sausage for her.  The staffer left the room and came back five minutes later with a new sausage saying the sausage my wife had wasn’t gluten-free, she had checked that with the chef even though we did not ask her to do so.  My wife also asked if there was some way to make the mattress softer, and the hotel staff figured out a solution. No one said no to any reasonable request.
The hotel itself is lovely. We had a graceful corner suite on the Aldwych end of the hotel that was whisper quiet. The decor works to calm the mind. Excellent bathroom and shower with a nice half bath to go with. I found the bed comfortable, and so did she after the fix. The pool is an added benefit for swimmers. 
On top all of this the hotel restaurant is excellent. They don’t bother to tell you the entire dinner menu is gluten-free. Yes, the whole menu. I’m not gf and love the place regardless. The bar can fill up and get noisy before musicals, but hotel guests can get their drinks delivered as we did to the library across the way, which is quiet and relaxed. 
All this and you are in the center of London, with easy walks to almost everything and the Underground nearby. 
Conclusion:
Expensive, yes. Worth it? Absolutely.",5,2023,04,07
147,Nice Place,"Hotel is perfectly located, nice, for the price not too big but very clean rooms with a spacious bath and an excellent service. Nice detail: use of Mini-Bar is included in the price. Breakfast is expensive and wasn’t top notch but alternatives are available in walking distance. ",4,2023,03,22
147,An oasis of peace and luxury,"One Aldwych, unlike other 5 stars in the capital, manages to strike a perfect balance between exclusivity and simplicity.  The location is perfect to explore touristic London but equally a perfect location for business travellers.
We thoroughly enjoyed the superb facilities and great customer service. ",5,2023,03,07
147,Super Hotel in every way,"Really enjoyed our three nights at this Hotel and will be back again for sure.  Service and facilities impeccable and every staff member so professional and friendly.  When you add this to it's very central location,  its a real winner.   Highly recommend....",5,2023,02,25
147,Excellent hotel,Well appointed and well maintained hotel. Great location. Thoughtfully and attractively designed room. Nice touch that there are some free drinks in the minibar even if you know the cost is captured in the room rate. Pleasant public bar. Friendly and polite staff. ,5,2023,02,20

Nice decoration gorgeous flower display in centre of room

147,Wonderful stay in London,"One Aldwych was the perfect home base from which to explore London. The rooms were beautiful, well thought out and so comfortable it was tempting to spend our whole trip relaxing at the hotel. The staff were all very kind, efficient and helpful. The hotel itself is very well appointed and the location was central to everything we were interested in - walkable to many of the biggest sights and in a lovely neighborhood with excellent shopping, dining and easy access to the underground if needed. ",5,2023,02,06
147,"Hospitality, Location, and Style – That’s One Aldwych","It had been eight years since our last trip to London, and we had an opportunity we just couldn’t resist. Our niece’s high school from Oklahoma was marching in the New Year’s Day parade and we wanted to show her and my sister-in-law around London for their first trip to Europe. We wanted a posh central location for the festivities, away from our last location at The Ritz in 2014. This is where Leading Hotels of the World never fails me – we found One Aldwych. The Covent Garden location with newly refreshed rooms and a pool sounded like the perfect formula for a wintery week in London.

Arrival was fantastic. We booked a Mercedes S550 pickup from Heathrow through the hotel, and our pickup was flawless. We felt guilty leaving behind our extended family to suffer through navigating a large group with charter buses. Upon arrival, the gentlemen at the bell desk were most welcoming and quickly got us into the lobby and took care of the bags. Check-in was extremely friendly, and the lobby and bar areas were stunning – a very impressive holiday spread in a beautiful room surrounded by art and large windows providing a full view of this lively part of town. We received a quick tour of the hotel, then (rejoice!) the room was ready and we could freshen up.

One Aldwych just went through an extensive renovation of their rooms, and let me tell you these rooms are impressive. Their designer did a wonderful job pulling in the lines, colors, and textures of the 1980’s into a classy modern take – full of bespoke furniture like marble-clad entertainment centers and custom built-ins. The room featured a complimentary snack and beverage bar, seating area, fresh flowers, welcome amenity, and a stunning bathroom with double washbasins and separate shower and bathtub. The shampoo, bodywash and lotion scent were wonderful and linens were all top specification – Frette and no less. Our room was silent. I couldn’t believe we were overlooking the Lion King theatre and never heard a thing! Their sixth floor was absolutely silent.

The pool, fitness and spa area were a real treat. On several afternoons, we would stop in for a refresh to warm up with a swim, steam and sauna. The spa team made sure everyone felt welcome and kept the area nice and tidy.

The food and beverage program here was wonderful, but very expensive. Thanks to Leaders Club from LHW, breakfast was complimentary each morning, but averaged about 80 pounds for two people. The waitstaff were very friendly, genuine, and attentive. Our friends at the bar mixed some fantastic cocktails a few nights during our stay and even stayed late on New Year’s Eve to mix us a round of Old Fashioned cocktails after we returned from the fireworks at 1:00AM. This was really an above and beyond gesture and made our evening after we realized the event down at the river was dry with 0% beer!

Some items to take note of – 

1) The hotel is no longer part of Leading Hotels of the World, but kindly honored the benefits during our stay. I think this is a huge miss; LHW is my go-to resource for trusted, independent luxury hotels.

2) We received mixed signals regarding taxi cabs. The hotel needs to educate their team on the taxi policy and align team member expectations. This is such a basic item, and honestly this is the only time a five-star hotel (in my lifetime of international travels) has been weird about taxi service, hailing taxis, and reserving taxis. Maybe this is a new London thing?

Overall, we would absolutely stay here once again. Fantastic hotel!",4,2023,02,01
147,One Aldwych One of a kind,extremly pleasant stay - outstanding service - beautiful room - fine health club - brilliant bar tenders/mixologists that created mean cocktails - we had a whale of a time and hope to stay at One Aldwych again in the near future,5,2023,01,12

147,A great stay at One Aldwych,"Had a wonderful few days in London, made all the better by our stay at One Aldwych.  The service and attentiveness were as good as it gets.  They were so unbelievably accommodating and helpful.  We had a few ""bumps"" in the road on our trip, having NOTHING to do with the hotel, but the staff at One Aldwych smoothed it all out. The rooms were great, comfortable, good-sized, and, clean.  NO complaints AT ALL.  A big thumbs up to Gloria and Mohammed at the front desk, and Alan, one of the concierges,  but please understand, EVERYONE was great.   The area was hopping, central, and ideal, especially for theatre.  Loved our stay and would happily return.  Thank so much !!",5,2023,01,04

147,Wonderful hotel,"My daughter and I stayed for a week and we couldn't have been happier.   Its location is ideal - close to Covent Garden, theatres and within walking distance of the tube.   The hotel was quiet, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms luxurious.  ALL the staff were professional, courteous and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble.   The food was good and the prices reasonable.   The downstairs bar was just the place for a drink after a long day of sightseeing.   Would not hesitate to recommend. ",5,2022,12,27
147,Elegance & consummate service,"Where to start? Refurbished rooms so elegant and perfect in every detail. Tons of thoughtful and generous gestures—heated bathroom floors, Dyson hair dryer, free snacks and soft drinks in the minibar, incredibly comfortable bedding. Concierge beyond helpful in organizing a last minute restaurant reservation on a Friday night when travel delay changed our plans. Front desk noted we had left our privacy light on by accident and texted to see if we did want room servicing (we did). Huge gym and amazing pool were a happy surprise in central london.

From the moment we arrived the staff are so attentive and very friendly. Nothing is too much to ask.

The room was so lovely and clean. The chocolate and champagne were a lovely touch and we were extremely grateful.  The mini bar and complimentary snacks were also lovely ☺️ The turn down service is also a  nice touch making it feel even more luxurious.

The lobby bar has a lovely atmosphere and was lovely to have a drink there on our final night.

Would 100% recommend and will be back for our anniversary 🤍",5,2022,12,11
147,Beautiful shiny new rooms and personal service. highly recommended,"Pros: We loved that the rooms are newly refurbished and beautiful- full of tech and a delicious complimentary mini bar. Unbeatable location. Bathroom with tub and TV. Excellent check in service. Breakfast was delicious - 5 star!

Cons: the lobby restaurant could do with a menu revamp. Also we watched one of the cleaners do a turn down service whereby she brought our clean cups back in an empty dust bin. I think she might need a little retraining! Lol.

Overall: gorgeous stay, amazing location and lovely people!",4,2022,12,10
147,The most perfect reunion brunch,"I cannot praise Aldwych One highly enough. In some hotels you feel ‘transported’ by the setting, the ambience, the service and the food: this hotel  is one of them. We had a family reunion and met for a late breakfast. We received a warm welcome on arrival and enjoyed a Bellini in the bar - which is stunning. Breakfast was perfect. Everything was cooked so well with quality ingredients and matched with outstanding service. We were not rushed at any point.Friendly staff made us feel so welcome and comfortable. A perfect way to spend a morning in London on the doorstep of Covent Garden.",5,2022,11,23

147,Fabulous from start to finish,"Whow, this hotel was fabulous.  I travelled with my friend to celebrate her special Birthday.   We arrived at 8.45am and our room was ready for us on arrival.  We stayed for 2 nights and we could not fault a single thing.  Every minute of our stay was spectacular due to the most friendly staff ever.  Every single person made us feel so special and made our stay so memorable.
The breakfast in the morning was outstanding, poached eggs were to perfection.  The bar was our favourite place - cocktail city.  There was a great atmosphere around the bar and again the staff were fantastic.    
One thing i have to say is the Christmas decorations are just so beautiful, very elegant and tasteful. The colour scheme top class.
The location of the hotel is fantastic - we went to see the Lion King and it was literally 30 seconds round the corner.
A huge thank you to every single member of staff who made our weekend so special, and also a big thanks for the beautiful Birthday cake you left in our room for my friend.
Such small touches go a long way.
Many thanks Ann and Maggie x",5,2022,11,21

147,Wonderful stay!,My wife and I stayed here for a few nights. The hotel is located near plenty of shopping and restaurants. The hotel staff are friendly and most helpful. Our room was good size for a London hotel room and was very comfortable. I also enjoyed using their gym and pool.,5,2022,10,26
147,Great stay at One Aldwych,"We had a great stay at One Aldwych.

Things we loved:
-- Outstanding service. Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful. Housekeeping was amazing. A doorman even rushed to push the button of the elevator for me when I had 2 cups of coffee in my hands!
-- Location. Right in the center of the theater district, near lots of great shops and restaurants. Yet somehow the hotel always seemed calm, even when the bar was very busy.
-- The pool, sauna, and steam room! Gorgeous pool (though in a less than gorgeous sub basement location). Fantastic place to relax after a day of sightseeing.

Things to be aware of:
-- The restaurant is gluten and dairy free (though the bar and room service are not).
-- Busy location. Our room was at the back of the building on the 5th floor (which is behind a stone parapet), so noise was not an issue.",5,2022,10,25
147,Great chilled atmosphere,"We visited on a Saturday night after a meal out, atmosphere was nice and chilled just what we needed! We were served by Lucio who was excellent, he went through the cocktails and advised us based on our preferences. Cocktails were excellent we tried from the Floral Street selection. 

Highly recommended 👏👏👏",5,2022,10,24
147,Spoiled for other hotels,"My husband and I stayed at One  Aldwych hotel and I fear we will be spoiled for future hotel stays.  The location was perfect for getting to all the sights. It’s close to a tube station and well as convenient to the Uber boats Thames Clippers.  You can get most anywhere by walking. 

Our room was lovely and kept up daily by the meticulous staff.   We ate breakfast each morning at Indigo during our 5 day stay.  It only took one day before the staff knew our preferences.  We only have praise for all of the hotel staff from check in to check out. 

We were able to enjoy the cocktail bar as well as the athletic facilities. But the magnificent pool was the favorite.  I only wish I had access to a pool like that at home. 

Again, thank you, One Aldwych, a member of a the Leading Hotels of the World, for a perfect stay.",5,2022,10,17
147,A dream in London,"The One Aldwych is one of the best hotels we've seen so far. We enjoyed our stay so much.

Be assured we will come again!",5,2022,10,16
147,One Aldwych stay awesome,"One Aldwych is a truly excellent hotel, with great staff and facilities - the bedrooms are luxurious, we have stayed many times and it is our favourite London hotel.

We book through Leading Hotels of the World and so get member benefits and points.

Excellent.",5,2022,10,15
147,From the moment we walked in the door!,"Just had dinner with my husband at Indigo at One Aldwych, chose it as I’m coeliac and very sensitive to Gluten.  From the moment we walked in the door we had a top class experience.  Greeted and taken to the restaurant, offered our choice of table, superb service and food.  Definitely recommend.",5,2022,10,12

The staff in particular are wonderful ",5,2022,10,11
147,4 Days in London,"We spent four days at One Aldwych in late September 2022. This is probably the highest level of service we have seen in a Hotel in many years. Every single person we came in contact with was courteous and wanting to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The room was well thought out, particularly for guests with 110 Volt computers and phones. Someone had done some thinking about who would be using the room when it was designed and so there were 110 Volt plugs provided. It was these small touches that are the basis of providing an excellent rating of this property. When we come back to London we will be staying at One Aldwych",5,2022,10,08
147,"Excellent service, friendly staff, great location","I enjoyed my stay because of the extremely friendly staff, excellent service, delicious breakfast and a spacious and modern room. The use of the minibar is included but it's worth to spend time at the really nice hotel bar.

Covent Garden is only a couple of minutes away.",5,2022,10,05
147,An Amazing Stay,"A wonderful experience from start to finish in this luxurious oasis right in the heart of vibrant London. We were at One Aldwych for a special occasion and with their impeccable, friendly service, everyone - from the reception to the restaurant to the house keeping - helped to make it even more special. Our suite was beautifully appointed with everything we could have wanted and more. A special mention should go to Samuel in reception who attended to our every need, and to the delightful ladies in the spa. My facial was superb and it was such a treat to have the pool to ourselves for a pre-breakfast swim. We would certainly love to return!",5,2022,09,27
147,Boutique Luxury in the heart of Covent Garden,An excellent guest-centric experience on the Strand with a short walking distance to the heart of the theatre district. The staff provide service excellence from the time you arrive until the time of your departure. ,5,2022,09,22
147,Best hotel we've experienced,"We've stayed at many hotels across the world & this was the best one we've been to. The suite we had was luxurious. Every amenity. Heated floors in the bathroom, comfortable bed & furniture, 2 large TV's, well stocked mini bar. If you become a member of Leading Hotels of the World (just sign up, it's free), you get complimentary breakfast & early/late check-in. 
The hotel restaurant has gluten free breakfast, afternoon tea & lunch/dinner. Such a treat for myself, who has a gluten allergy to be able to enjoy a meal without any worries.",5,2022,09,22
147,Incredible,"I’m not normally particularly gushing with reviews but we were completely blown away by One Aldwych. We only stayed one night, the first night of our honeymoon, but it was by far the best hotel stay I have ever had. The hotel is beautiful, location amazing, but it’s the staff that made it so special - we were upgraded without realising it and had the most incredible Bridge View Suite, it was perfection. We also had wine and nibbles arrive as a congratulations from the hotel. Every staff member we had any interaction with was friendly and attentive, but not over the top or overly servile, it was spot on. Everything was spectacular, the attention to detail just phenomenal. If you get an opportunity to stay there, do it!",5,2022,09,21
147,"Fun, delicious afternoon tea","Amazing, fun afternoon tea. One of the best I’ve had,  and I’ve had a lot. Great selection of sandwiches and desserts. Lovely staff who were really friendly and helpful. Great theme, decor and atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to others",5,2022,09,20
147,One Terrific Hotel,"My partner, Joan Price, and I were delighted by the friendliness of the staff and the beauty of the facilities. The hotel’s food was excellent, and the location superb. Bravo, One Aldwych Hotel! We recommend it most highly.",5,2022,09,16
147,Excellent!,"Our stay was perfect, thank you! The service was excellent - every member of staff was friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. Our room was lovely and the wonderful service by housekeeping was much appreciated. As a Coeliac (gluten free) I also greatly appreciated being able to eat safely and have a “proper” hotel experience - thank you! Indigo was a delight, the food was delicious and so well presented. Again, it was the warmth and attentiveness of the staff at One Aldwych that made our stay so special and we hope to stay again soon!",5,2022,09,14
147,Honeymoon in London,"We stayed in the hotel for a night without our 3 year old a few days after our wedding in Sept 2022. 

It’s a very plush hotel as it is, but they very generously upgraded our room to an amazing suite looking down towards Waterloo Bridge, and then a little while later brought up wine, fruits, cake and honeycomb, the latter made from honey from the rooftop hive. Urban rooftop beekeeping is a real thing, I now know. 
That was a nice and unexpected treed touch and made us feel very special. 

It’s a luxurious hotel, perfectly situated for for the theatre-land, Covent Garden, Royal Opera House and the bars and restaurants of the West End. 

The team are very warm and welcoming we felt very well looked after.",5,2022,09,13
147,Truly authentic 5 star experience in prime central London.,"Fabulous experience in ultimate luxury in prime central London.

The atmosphere, service, location, cleanliness and breakfast were great.
The staff was helpful and efficient.
We do hope to visit again soon.
:) :) :)",5,2022,09,05
147,Perfect in every way!,"We went for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea. It was for an occasion, but not necessary to the experience.
When we arrived we were warmly welcomed, they held out bags for us too so we didn't have to have them at the table. The tables were spaced nicely so it didn't feel cramped and it was decorated in such a way that just highlighted everything about the place.
The afternoon tea was amazing! Couldn't finish it all, even on an empty stomach, but the vegan option we had was perfect. Presented so nicely and the flavours were incredible! The gentlemen looking after us were very caring and would only check up on you when required, not bothering too much but very easy to talk to. The cocktails were really nice as well and the selection of teas were broad too with some interesting flavours.
Overall, I couldn't fault anything about the meal. There were families with children there too and the waiters were making them feel at ease and offering them a lot of their time to make sure they were happy and with a small joke here and there.
I would certainly go again, especially for the price and what you get compared to some others around London.",5,2022,09,05
147,"Second visit, even better than the first!","Stayed for 4 nights in the wonderfully relaxing and luxurious One Aldwych hotel.  Delighted to be so welcomed, remembered and upgraded by the wonderful Hannah.  Had the most beautiful suite overlooking Waterloo Bridge and honestly did not want to leave!  We were there during the heatwave and the coolness and spaciousness of the room was pure bliss!  Everything was utterly faultless but as before, it is the warmth of the staff which makes this hotel so special.  A huge thank you to the lovely lady in reception (didn't catch her name but remember she said she's from Rome) who could not have been any kinder or more patient trying to fix my son's toy car.  Such a lovely lady.  I am already planning my next visit in October, would not even consider any other London hotel.  Thank you once again One Aldwych for such an enjoyable visit.",5,2022,08,30
147,Experience was excellent,It waa a great experience to stay at this hotel. I will recommend everyone in my contacts to must stay over there whenever visit London. Hotel ambience and location all are just perfect. And food was also excellent.,5,2022,08,30
147,Fabulous place,"Went with my daughter and we had the most wonderful stay.  Fantastic room, circular, with wonderful views onto London.  The hotel has a lovely bar with charming decor.  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, breakfast in the restaurant - all served at the table which made a great change from the usual buffet with everyone crowding around.  Good choice of breakfast options.
The location of this hotel is brilliant - right by the bustling Covent Garden.  It is an oasis of calm in the centre of London.",5,2022,08,25
147,Father and Son Vacation In One Aldwych,"We were in a family trip in London, father and son. We stayed in One Aldwych hotel. One of the best hotels we have ever been to! The service was great, the rooms were clean and big, the location was in the middle of London close to all the attractions, the food was very good and the spa, the gym and the pool were magnificent. Highly recommended!",5,2022,08,21
147,Best independent hotel in London (Gluten Free heaven),"This place is worth every penny….. 

Location 10/10
Food 10/10
Decor and cleanliness 10/10
Staff 10/10

We stayed here for 1 night in August. Everything was impeccable, I couldn’t even find something to score them down on. The staff were all fantastic, a couple were outstanding at service but I didn’t get their names. I had several personal touches as it was my birthday on the day we arrived. 

Food was incredible and Indigo restaurant is accredited by Coeliac UK which was a bonus as I have Coeliacs. The tasting menu with Wine pairing is highly recommended as is the gluten free fish & chips! 10/10 will go back as soon as I can.",5,2022,08,21
147,Fabulous stay,"This hotel has lovely rooms, is very central and exceptional service.  The bed was very hard but upon our request they were very obliging in putting an extra mattress topper on.  Might be worth thinking about different mattresses. Other than that the overall experience was amazing thank you for such a lovely weekend and we hope to visit again soon. ",4,2022,08,19
147,A beautiful stay in a central location,"We stayed as a family of four with two small children under 2 and had the most incredible weekend. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The mini bar was a great bonus alongside all the thoughtful extras like baby friendly products in the bathroom, a mini baby bath and soft baby towels. 

We stayed in a room overlooking Waterloo bridge which was a great experience for my eldest son who watched the buses go by. Despite it being so busy in the street we didn’t hear a thing in the room which gave us a very peaceful night! 

The swimming pool is a refreshing change to chlorinated water and great to relax in after a busy day exploring London. The gym is very well equipped and clean! 

Every single member of the team we had the pleasure of meeting were amazing. Breakfast was served smoothly and they helpfully and happily met our toddlers needs and actively made him feel special. 

The hotel is in a great location for exploring Covent Garden and just round the corner from The London Transport Museum and walking distance from all the local attractions- I used the handy little wrist map in the room to route a run! 

Thank you so much for such a wonderful stay ",5,2022,08,19
147,Great London Hotel,"One of the finest hotels we’ve ever stayed in. Try to get the Bridgeview studio. The room is large with a beautiful view of the Waterloo bridge and traffic below. We visited during a heatwave but you wouldn’t know it because it had US style air conditioning. Food and drinks were excellent. Arriving from NY in the morning, we weren’t certain we could check in early — they seemed to expect and since the room was ready we checked in about 12:30pm. Service was impeccable with evening turndown. All in all, an elegant hotel. ",5,2022,08,17
147,Outstanding,"Great location.  Hotel feels new.  Rooms are small but very comfortable, clean and nicely done.  Very comfortable beds.  Excellent service.  Can’t recommend this hotel in London enough.  Wonderful, included mini-bar too.",5,2022,08,16
147,Simply amazing!,"My family and I recently stayed for two nights in this simply amazing hotel. The decor is beautiful. The attention to detail and cleanliness is faultless and the staff are so welcoming, informative and attentive. The location was perfect for our planned theatre trip. We couldn’t keep our children out of the basement pool, 18 metres long, lit with calming green lighting, under water music and a huge projector screen at one end showing all sorts of sea life. The food was simply amazing too, we sure needed that swim after the delicious breakfast we all consumed! If you have time, I would also recommend having a spa treatment, plenty on offer and a great way to unwind after a busy day in London!",5,2022,08,15
147,Five star service,"Truly one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The location is very convenient to everything. It was a short walk to china town, covent garden, shopping, oxford street, bond street, and also near the tubes. You can also catch a taxi right outside or call an uber so it was easy to get to anywhere you need to be. I had the best time here. Anything I needed, it was just a call to front desk and they would make it happen. The staff is also super nice and helpful. It is a 5 star hotel so it is pricey but worth it. It looks elegant, classy, but modern at the same time.  The room is a nice size, with a Dyson hair dryer, and all the toiletries you need. The bed is comfortable. There is a separate tub and shower. I didn't like the pool, but that's not a big deal as I didn't have time to go to it. I would definitely stay here again. Save yourself the time and research and just book this hotel if you are visiting London.",5,2022,08,13
147,Impeccable Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a milestone wedding anniversary recently and we were so glad we did. Everything was outstanding - immaculate furnishings, first class service - everything with a smile and nothing too much trouble. We had vegan gluten free dietary requirements and the hotel did everything imaginable to accommodate - we had dinner at Indigo restaurant and a Charlie and The Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea which were both delicious and relaxing.  The staff are all so professional and polite. There's a gorgeous gym with the best Technogym equipment money can buy, and there's even a Peloton bike and a gorgeous pool too.  The location was absolutely ideal.  We walked EVERYWHERE from here - Soho, Westminster, Covent Garden, Buckingham Palace and loved every minute of it. You can even stream from your own phone or laptop apps onto the TV and so watch whatever you feel like. And despite being in central London the rooms are super quiet and beds really comfortable for a great night's  sleep. You can also open the window if you wish (a rarity!). There were so many thoughtful, personal touches during our stay at this hotel which made things all the more memorable. Everything went so smoothly we had a really relaxing trip.  Would highly recommend for business or pleasure! We will be back!",5,2022,08,09
147,Amazing service,"The staff at One Aldwych went above and beyond my and my family’s wildest expectations, from helping us set up activities for us to bending culinary standards to the whims of a picky eater, their commitment to accommodating us was unwavering. Exceptional service.",5,2022,08,08
147,Excellent stay at the Heart of London,"I can’t vouch enough for this hotel. I can confirm, that for any of my future trips to London, I will be staying here. They got a loyal customer in me!!
Our flight landed at Gatwick at 8:30 and we were at the hotel by 11 AM and though the checkin time was 3 PM, concierge was extremely accommodating and got us the room by 1. Amenities, room service and cleanliness were impeccable but you expect that from any 5-star hotels but the main thing that really stood out for me was their staff and their warmth and 
genuine effort to help and take interest on guests’ interest.
I had really pleasant interactions with many of the hotel staff while having breakfast and drinks at the bar. I mentioned casually that we were going to Madame Tussauds and one particular celebrity I am keen on taking pictures with, and the next morning when we met, he did make it a point to check how our trip to MT was and whether my expectations for the celebrity statue were met and also provided some useful tips on our day’s plan when we mentioned we are going to Lord’s.
Even in the lobby bar, when we casually mentioned that we are planning to take a taxi to go to Gatwick, we were immediately provided with really helpful suggestion to take Gatwick Express and provided us with all necessary details.
Can’t thank enough to each and every member of the hotel staff who ensured we had the best time possible",5,2022,08,06

147,Great Hotel in fabulous location,"Beautiful 5 star hotel in the Covenant Garden/theater district location in London. The staff was attentive and eager to help with any and all needs during your stay. The ""London Poppy"" cocktail is a must during your stay. Our room was cute yet on the smaller side, however I learned this is normal in the city of London. I prefer a softer bed, but the room darken curtain allowed for a comfortable nights rest. Turn down and slippers were a nice touch. On arrival, we were surprised by fresh flowers and sweet treats on our cafe table. Would stay again for sure. ",5,2022,07,27
147,Simply Amazing !,"Amazing service, amazing decor and amazing meals. Rooms are beautiful and cozy after a major renovation. Conveniently close  to all theatres and Covent Garden. The best gluten and dairy free meals at Indigo! Gorgeous amenities especially for the little ones.",5,2022,07,23
147,The best in central London,"We couldn't have picked a better hotel for a luxury stay while seeing and doing all the things central London is famous for.  
The location, room, facilities, food and all the staff at One Aldwych really demonstrated what Five Star should mean. And not in a formal, stuffy way. It's a friendly place, not an oversized, impersonal 'corporate' hotel - that shows in the treatment you get in the restaurant, bar, leisure facilities and at the front desk.",5,2022,07,23
147,Exceptional service,"Perfectly located hotel with exceptional service. 
All of the staff are friendly and very attentive. 
Excellent breakfast and bar snacks.

147,Ms. Chu,"Excellent service.  My room was overlooking the main street, but the double windows make the room very quiet.  Beautifully appointed rooms.  The complimentary mini-bar makes our stay so convenient.  The Concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful.  We enjoyed the restaurant food too.  I highly recommend this hotel :) ",5,2022,07,07
147,"Once Again, Perfect Comfort, Flawless Service.","When we come to London, we always come to the Aldwych, not only is it centrally located in the Theater District, it is near all the major sites.   The service is exceptional and nothing is left to worry about, when placed in the hands of this staff.   Even when our flight was cancelled and we had to reschedule our pickup at the airport, the staff at the Aldwych came through with perfect style and a quick response.   The rooms are as always, beauty and comfortable, and the beds are so inviting after a long trip.   If you stay here, you must dine here!    The meals are filling and so fantastically prepared!    They do gluten-free meals and they make them with such perfection!     The bar staff makes wonderful drinks and are attentive to your every need.   If you cannot tell, we love the Aldwych and we shall be back again, and again!",5,2022,07,06

147,The best birthday ever!,"Simply outstanding!  Having travelled the world and stayed at the best of hotels, our stay One Aldwych to celebrate our granddaughter’s birthday was exceptional.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and yet ‘at home’.  The staff, from Front of House Manager to Chambermaid, could not have done more to welcome us and give the birthday girl every possible treat.  The room was beautiful, the food delicious, the service exceptional.  I look forward to my next visit!",5,2022,07,03
147,"Friendly, Genuine and Professional Service!","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from the 27th June.  We booked it for our 20th wedding anniversary as a treat for ourselves as we stayed here last year and loved it.  The floral display in the lobby is striking because it has a Wimbledon theme complete with giant tennis balls.  We booked a deluxe room and were upgraded to a  Deluxe Bridge Suite, courtesy of concierge Claudia.  The room was fantastic, a brilliant surprise!  It was round, so unusual and spacious and the view is directly opposite Waterloo Bridge.  The Dyson hairdryers are a real luxury touch.  There was a lovely anniversary card and sweet treat to welcome us when we arrived.  The cleanliness and housekeeping was faultless.  So modern and bright with great attention to detail.  Claudia showed us to the room and was just as excited as we were, I think because she is proud of the hotel.   She's a credit to the team. She was in cahoots with my husband as between them they booked a surprise trip on the dinner bus, Bustronome, which was also great.  She even emailed before to say she had booked a steak restaurant for us to put me off the scent.  So sneaky but in a good way!  This was only our second stay at the hotel but we honestly were made to feel like regulars, like we were welcomed back to a second home.  
We had our anniversary dinner celebration in the Indigo restaurant on the Wednesday night.  We were a late for our reservation and the restaurant was busy but were not made to feel this was a problem.  They took it in their stride, included a  bottle of complimentary bubbles in our room (again, Claudia's sneaky work) which we had with our meal.   The food was delicious.  Hot, tasty and imaginative and once again attentive service.  
I love to swim, so this is a perfect choice for us because there is really good sized pool in the lower level of the hotel.  Unusual for central  London.  The changing facilities there are extremely clean and well stocked with complimentary products to use.  
The whole team of staff in this hotel are friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable, professional and approachable.  For a luxury hotel this is really nice because we are ordinary people that have to save to stay here and we were made to feel very comfortable and relaxed at all times.  It totally enhanced our stay in London and we would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking to stay in this standard of hotel.",5,2022,07,03
147,London Summer Ball,"I have been at least 100 and brought numerous guests 
Price is now excessive no loyalty bonus I will have to look at alternatives 
Noticeable turnover in Staff 
No eye contact from Bar staff but of a underwhelming atmosphere in Bar 
Change in road traffic not helped your q cause now very difficult to get to the front door ",4,2022,06,26
147,Not what it used to be,"There’s something wrong with a hotel when you phone to book a suite, and are told it will need to be done by someone else the next day, and that they’ll call you back…
And they don’t bother. 
So you call the next day, and are told exactly the same, and once again they don’t bother calling. 
At One Aldwych these days, it seems that on the third day of trying, you might actually get someone who can be bothered to help, but ONLY you’ve emailed to explain you’re about to leave a bad review here!!
Appalling and rude service, especially by a person called Tariq. 
I’ve stayed here in the last quite a few times, but never ever again. 
Avoid.",1,2022,06,26

147,A country house hotel in the city,"Amazing hotel and staff. We were considering a country house hotel for our trip, but were swayed by the two free nights offer for a weeklong stay and decided to spend a week in London. I was worried that the vibe would be busy given the Covent Garden location. Quite the contrary; it was an oasis of calm. Concierge, doorman, housekeeping staff were excellent. Our room was wonderful and was tidied up every time we left. I can’t think of a thing they could have done better.",5,2022,06,12

147,Perfect Hotel in London,"One Aldwych is a lovely hotel centrally located near Covent Garden.  It is steps away from Somerset House and Trafalgar Square.  We received a very warm welcome upon arrival.  We arrived earlier than expected and we were taken to our room right away.  The lobby, mezzanine (dining room) and rooms are beautifully designed and decorated.  Our room was on the sixth floor with a nice city view.  It was well appointed with nice touches like a complimentary mini bar with beverages and snacks as well as nice robes and bathroom toiletries.  The bed was very comfortable and each day the room was made up to perfection.  Breakfast was included with our stay and we were pleasantly surprised with the extensive offerings on the breakfast menu.  There were so many things to choose from - freshly made juices, egg dishes, porridge, fresh fruit, selections of coffees and tea.  We stayed for nine nights and enjoyed a different breakfast every day.  The restaurant offers dairy free and gluten free dishes.  The morning staff were very pleasant and warmly welcomed us each day.  The concierge helped us organize a day trip to Oxford which was very enjoyable.  All the staff are very friendly and made a point of saying hello and welcoming us back each time we came and went.  We did have one minor issue with the billing however, that was rectified immediately to our total satisfaction and did not blemish our experience there.  In fact we would not hesitate to stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone travelling to London.",5,2022,06,10

147,Highly recommend!!!,"Having arrived in London at a time that coincided both with a tube strike and a change in the weather, we decided to spend most of our time enjoying our Hotel.  What a gem of a Hotel One Aldwych is and somewhat surprisingly with so much to offer.  The gym is world-class with the latest equipment and the rooms are just gorgeous but also functional – we did not want to leave.  Eventually we did drag ourselves out into Covent Garden which is vibrant and packed with luxury brands fabulous independent shops.  I couldn’t leave a review without including a mention to the wonderful One Aldwych team who went out of their way to make us feel at home.",5,2022,06,08
147,Perfect boutique hotel in the center of everything,"My husband and I stayed here the four nights immediately before the Jubilee. From the moment I booked my reservation to the moment we walked out the doors for the last time, the staff treated us with care and respect and amazing attention to detail. The hotel is beautiful well thought out and just the right combination of size and elegance. We will be back!",5,2022,06,07
147,Fantastic Stay,"We couldn't have picked a better place to spend our week stay in London. We have stayed at One Aldwych before the refurbishment and now, its even more elegant and beautiful as ever. The staff were pleasant and accommodating which made the stay even more special. I celebrated a milestone birthday and the hotel made it special by surprising me with a bottle of sparkling wine , a cake and a lovely card signed by the staff. Thank you One Aldwych for a fantastic stay and we can't wait to come back.",5,2022,06,03
147,Luxurious overnight stay,"Having decided to spend a 5* night in London with a friend visiting from New Zealand, I am struggling to find any fault with One Aldwych. The plumbing was a bit noisy, but did that detract from our stay? The answer is not at all! Yes, it was rather pricey, but you get what you pay for - a very clean room with comfy beds and pillows, inclusive minibar, prime location, excellent breakfast and great customer service. Also highly recommend the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea!",5,2022,05,30
147,Excellent place to stay,"The staff was extremely helpful, and the place is well located.

We stayed for our honeymoon and it was nothing but pleasant.

I really can't say enough - they just did a great job and it was exactly what I expected for the kind of money we spent.

One negative feedback - the pool has some 'blue planet' playing on a big screen. Maybe don't show the stuff with great white sharks while people are swimming.",5,2022,05,26
147,We love this place,"I was trying to decide the best title to explain the way we feel about this place, and couldn’t come up with anything better. We, that is my husband and I, love this place. To be honest, it’s not the modern and stylish decor. Nor is it the position in the heart of the London theatre landscape. The drinks and food on offer definitely hit a spot, but not the main spot.
If you want to be treated like the most important people in the world, with patience, understanding and a ridiculously capable team, then join us in staying at the Aldwych as often as you can.
We feel more like family now, and love many of the staff, old and new. Without any preferences, please go and meet Claudia, Alan, Madi, Ari, Leroy, Stephano, Alexis and Hannah, plus many more who’s names escape us, and say hi from us.",5,2022,05,15
147,A Gem in a Great Locale,Our third stay at this charming and highly professional hotel.  Small enough for personal service; large enough for all amenities…great bar/restaurant; room service; fitness center and spa; concierge that can perform wonders.  Sorry to share this. Might become too popular,5,2022,05,08
147,Better than the best,"This hotel has thought of every comfort & convenience. The staff are delightful and happy to make everything exceed expectations. It is very well managed. 
The Lobby Bar is a treat. 
The rooms are beautiful & very comfortable indeed. Also well serviced. 
The food is also exceptional. From bar snacks to 3 course meals. ",5,2022,05,05
147,Amazing!,"This was our second visit to One Aldwych but it wont be the last, from start to finish the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us...Always with a smile and a friendly chat.
The room was ultra clean, beautifully decorated and had everything we needed...Even a free mini bar in our room!
Highly recommended!",5,2022,05,02
147,Amazing Birthday Treat,"Had a fantastic trip to London, a birthday present for my 60th, loved the hotel. The staff could not do enough to make our stay special. From proving champagne and treats to booking the restaurant. Cocktails in the bar were amazing.",5,2022,05,02
147,Exceptional Service!,"My husband and I had a weeklong stay at the One Aldwych in April. We came all the way from Singapore and were looking forward to our holiday in London, after a 2-year international travel drought. One Aldwych did not disappoint. 

We had such a lovely and enjoyable stay. The hotel is superb. Location is great. Service was exemplary. 

What was truly remarkable for us? The hotel staff. 
Staff from the front desk, concierge, room service were attentive, enthusiastic, excellent. Housekeeping paid attention to minute details in our room which made all the difference. They seemed to predict all that we needed in our stay without us having to say anything - the mini bar was always stocked, simple items like tissue boxes were placed where we needed them (and not just the usual locations), etc. Even on the last day, the staff made sure we had transport to our destination and will reach on time. The service was not just thorough but thoughtful — we felt special and cared for. In fact, I'm already coming back in June to stay here again!",5,2022,04,28
147,Wonderful Hotel in Great Location!,"I recently stayed at One Aldwych with my two teenage kids. Fantastic stay! The level of service was top notch. The whole staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. The bartenders in the lobby bar make outstanding craft cocktails. The Covent Garden neighborhood is great, also. Full of restaurants, pubs and theatres. I highly recommend One Aldwych!!",5,2022,04,25
147,A Stokes,Once again I’ve had fantastic stay. All the staff cannot do enough for you rooms are great . We eat  at indigo as well and it  is excellent . Every time we have stayed the service has always very good .,5,2022,04,22
147,Fantastic hotel,"A fantastic hotel and highly recommended.  The hotel is beautifully presented, and the staff are very attentive and made us feel instantly welcome.  We stayed in a deluxe room which was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean.  The bed and linen were top quality.  The bar, restaurant and spa are all equally excellent.  We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2022,04,20
147,Worthy of five stars,"My wife and I recently stayed at One Aldwych.  The hotel was absolutely perfect--exactly the kind of quality you'd expect for the price.  The room was lovely and stylishly decorated, the staff were friendly and professional, and the dining and bar were top notch.  The bathroom was an especial highlight, silly as it sounds--we're Americans and are used to gigantic bathrooms that are almost never to be found in Europe.  But this one was sprawling and luxurious with a great shower.  A+++  The spa was quite nice as well, and the masseuses were terrific.  Zero complaints at all.  It delivers luxury exactly as you'd hope.",5,2022,04,18
147,Fabulous place,"I knew our stay will be wonderful when booked one night at One Aldwych but it has surpassed our expectations. 
Exceptional location, thoughtfully renovated and equipped room  with electric curtain control, electric sockets with every possible connection you might need including usb c port, Loewe TV, B&O speaker, fully stocked minibar, Nespresso coffee machine. 
The bed was very comfortable and linen was a dream! 
Underfloor heating in the bathroom, sensuous Mitchel and Peach toiletries, powerful shower and lush towels. 
Little wonderful details like a welcome card and some chocolates, real plants and flowers, book by the bed screams thoughtfulness and appreciation. 
What else can you ask for? Oh yes - top notch service and attentiveness from the whole team. 
Energetic concierge, professional front office, immaculate housekeeping and attentive restaurant teams made us feel very special. 
We didn’t use health club or gym/pool facilities but there is always next time..",5,2022,04,14
147,Saturday evening cocktails,"My partner & I met my sister & bro-in-law for pre-dinner cocktails  at The Lobby Bar at One Aldwych yesterday evening .
The service was polite, efficient and friendly.  The cocktails were super: we chose Dirty Martinis, Pink Panthers, Mojitos, For Love, Old Cuban, Old Fashioned and an Aperol Spritz. All delicious but For Love was especially good if you like spice/heat as it contained a chilli-infused vodka. Highly recommended. ",5,2022,04,10
147,"Excellent service, excellent food, unique experience.","Partner and I visited for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea, with cocktails in the One Aldwych bar before. All the staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming and helpful, in both the bar and the restaurant. 

Cocktails were served quickly (in the 30mins we had before our afternoon tea) and the staff directed us to main entrance to the restaurant, to maximise our experience (totally worth it). 

Afternoon tea was excellent. Extra sandwiches, teas and coffees were offered (and taken!) before the sweet courses, which were presented in an amazing style. 

Will be a great memory of visiting for a long time.",5,2022,04,10
147,"Location, style and customer service","The service here is faultless. The hotel is gorgeous, stylish and fresh and the facilities are great. We left feeling totally relaxed and recharged. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in with those luxuriously crisp sheets, I didn’t want to leave.",5,2022,04,06
147,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed for an anniversary weekend. We upgraded to a deluxe room which was well laid out, beautifully appointed and lots of lovely touches: everything had been well thought out and everything was as you would expect for a hotel of this quality. A nice bottle of bubbly courtesy of the hotel also was delivered. So rare you get places that go the extra mile.
The really special bit is the swimming pool and spa in the basement- unusual for a Central London hotel. As usual it was quiet and in fact we had it to ourselves on the Monday morning.
The lobby bar is a cool place to hang out- alas the prices are eye watering and even on the unnecessary side but if you aren’t frequenting then it’s good to indulge.
Only negatives- bed was pretty hard and although the window had a room all we could see was the back of a parapet wall: that said - we were only in the room at night!
Top notch. Hope to stay again soon.",5,2022,04,04
147,Beautiful hotel with eye for detail and impeccable service,"I stayed one night in the hotel going to London for business. Was warmly welcomed by the concierge Claudia who went out of her way to be helpful. The rooms are very nice with all you can expect from this type of 5 star hotel (amazing bed with cool sheets; plugs for each continent, hand written note; little cakes, complementary minibar and snacks, good strong shower…). The hotel has a nice pool and great gym with the latest machines (including a peloton bike). Breakfast was wonderful with once again the most friendly and amazing service (my toast arrived with the bowl of berries but before the eggs; as the toast cooled down by the time the eggs came they were exchanged for a new set). Will definitely stay here again when I visit London on business or privately with the family.",5,2022,04,03
147,Amazing attention to detail 👌,"Everything from start to finish was amazing. The staff and facilities are great. The cot, baby bath, baby sponges and shower gels were a nice touch. It surpassed all expectations for our wedding anniversary. 

They even posted back our flask we forgot. 

We’ll definitely be back!",5,2022,04,01
147,Pleasantly Surprised! Lovely Hotel,Everything was great. Well appointed rooms - lots of details and surprises. Didn’t feel any of the cutbacks other hotels claim are happening because of covid. The rooms are a little small but the have nice flow and sound proof windows.  A real 5 star hotel in a time where so many hotels claim to be 5 star and truly are not even close. Great hotel. ,5,2022,03,29
147,"Beautiful, Understated Glamour","Beautiful, well thought out rooms with luxurious amenities and extras. comfortable bed, fabulous service, amazing location, great staff, and the added luxury of a basement pool which is rare in Central London .",5,2022,03,28
147,Family vacation - March 2022,We absolutely loved our stay. The rooms were wonderful and were kept perfectly clean constantly. The entire staff was pleasant and greeted us by name. The lobby bar was fabulous as was the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory tea.,5,2022,03,25
147,Fantastic boutique London hotel - Incredible Staff!,"We stayed at One Aldwych in March 2022 for two nights. From the moment we arrived (late at night) to when we checked out, the staff where fantastic and made us feel incredibly welcomed and valued as guests. 

We were celebrating an family occasion - Ahead of time the team contacted to discuss how they could make our stay special (which they did!), the staff went above and beyond what other premium hotels do in welcoming us and engaging with us during our stay.
Special call out to the concierge and valet team (I forget the name of female team member from Rome, who really was exceptional)

Location is perfect for central London - everything in Covent Garden/Leicester Sq./Soho/Strand is easily walkable and there's plenty of dining/entertainment/sightseeing options in the area",5,2022,03,25
147,Wonderful as always,"Perfect hotel in the perfect location. Staff are excellent and service is flawless. The rooms are very well designed and comfortable and the pool is one of the nicest in a central london hotel. Only two very minor grumbles - the pool should open at 6.30 seven days a week as the 8am opening at the weekends eats into the day - and the current choice of toiletries is less good than some previous ones like REN. How about Aesop in future?
Food and service in Indigo were very good but the bar tends to get too busy pre theatre and the scented cocktails are overpriced and not very nice - how about a perfect unmessed about with martini?",5,2022,03,11
147,Great Staff,"Five star hotels need staff that work together seamlessly in the luxury hospitality arena. 
One Aldwych delivers this and more.

Too many people to thank, but a special mention to Kriti Barr, Hannah and Norman.

No negatives, as any problems are dealt with immediately.

I have already reserved a further 2 night stay later this year.
Good job everyone!",5,2022,03,01
147,Excellent 2 night stay,"A massive thank you for making my birthday stay extra special. Check in by Alex was swift and friendly following a fairly difficult journey ( disrupted due to storms). So pleased and ready for the calm sanctuary of the hotel. 
Room very comfortable; loved the corner position with dual  window aspect. Good size. 
Quality mattress/ pillows and linen.
Excellent amenities Inc shower pressure, Dyson hairdryer ( so good!), Hospitality tray/bar and more.
Breakfast was good. Very quiet when we were there.
Love the dogs in reception. 
Every staff member we met was courteous, friendly and professional.",5,2022,02,27
147,First class stay,"Weekend treat arranged for my mums 80th birthday and she said it was the best hotel she has ever stayed at. Everything was perfect .Beautiful room, wonderful service and wonderful food. She was very looked after and was very impressed . Thank you.",5,2022,02,23
147,Excellent every aspect,"I stayed in the bridge suite 2nd floor, in Feb 2022. Check in process was super easy & friendly. My suite was absolutely fabulous. The room was spacious, huge bed with a big couch. Plenty of storage spaces with 2 closets & a small table with chairs. Upon arrival, some dessert was delivered to my room, it was such a considerate gesture. The room came with filtered bottled water, which in my opinion was very smart, it saved me from buying bottles of water. Mattress was super comfy although the pillows were very soft, they flatten out easily. I’m sure had i asked for different pillows, they would have been happy to help. 

PLENTY of built-in charging ports for your phone, laptop etc. small details like that make a huge difference. 

Huge tv that you can connect your phone to & watch Netflix. 

PLENTY OF LIGHT! Hotels typically are quite dim but this was very well lit, i loved the amount of light in the room. 

Coffee machine, & water kettle and some tea bags & sugar were complimentary. 

Beautiful view of the city and windows that open. Big thick curtains if you want to sleep-in. 

The important part to me is the bathroom. It had a huge bathtub (lots of bubble baths) and a spacious walk-in shower. Two sinks as well. Although the bathroom was small, it had plenty of storage space. I never had an issue storing my shampoos, lotions etc. 
Of course the hotel provided me with shampoos & lotion etc. 

My only complaint is the air condition. The AC can easily be adjusted to whatever temperature you prefer, but really that was not a cold AC. It can be set to the lowest 16 Celsius but it’s not cold. I live in the middle east & i know how ACs operate & that was not a good AC. However, London is cold in Feb so the fact that the AC did not operate properly was not an issue. But in summer, it will be a problem. 

Small other complaint, noise. Adjacent to the hotel there is a theatre and you can hear all the noise. My suite was right next to the theatre. The bathroom plumbing used to make noises as well but not much that u cannot sleep. 

Hotel is a bit far from shopping areas. Nearest i think was Charring station underground, 10 mins walk. 
There is a nearby Tesco (supermarket) and McDonalds, Pizza Hut, a cafe. All taxi drivers know the hotel, I never had an issue with directions. 

Other than that, the hotel was perfection. Staff super friendly & cooperative. Cleaning services were very polite.  My suite was amazing, I can’t find fault in the stay! 

Would i recommend? Absolutely. 
Would i return? Absolutely.",5,2022,02,22
147,Fun Afternoon tea for kids!,"Thanks for a fun and friendly Charlie & the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea. Bit of a treat price wise but all the trimmings are there including candy floss and fun sweets, delicious scones and fab cocktails for the adults. Very professional staff.",4,2022,02,21
147,Great hotel with amazing staff! ,"Fantastic hotel! The room, bathroom and the rest of the hotel was spotlessly clean. The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for you. I felt the pool was a little cold and they could do with a couple more loungers/ seats if they can find the room, but this didn't detract from the experience. I would definitely return.

The location is perfect for the theatres too.",5,2022,02,21
147,weekend treat,"Excellent stay , got some friends to stay here instead of over the road ! they loved the place too. loved the bar area with magnolia tree. service was really good . would recommend to all . has had a revamp since last visit , really smarten place up. room was lovely.",5,2022,02,11
147,Happy Stay!,"Fantastic 3 nights stay.  Every member of staff did their utmost to make our stay perfect from the greeting we received on arrival to our last drink in the bar before returning home.  Great location, so near to the river and Covent Garden and close to Theatres and restaurants. Our room was very quiet couldn't hear the traffic and the big bonus was the indoor pool in the basement.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.",5,2022,02,10
147,No 1 Adwych,"No 1 Aldwych is a long term London favourite by use of the exceedingly good Lobby Bar for many years. This year we decided to take our 5 night Christmas break at No 1 and could not have been more warmly welcomed.  The kindness and warmth came from all areas of the hotel, from reception / doormen to wonderful Guilllame in the Lobby Bar.  Our Christmas lunch at the hotel was simply sublime with no rush and time for our party to enjoy the fabulous food, English wines and lovely atmosphere.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for a special experience in welcoming surroundings. Thank you.",5,2022,02,07
147,Simply Immaculate,"Truly a 5 star experience. everything from arrival to departure and everything in between was immaculate. Spot on attention form the staff, superbly appointed room, great food. Lovely spa and swimming pool. Faultless.

A very deserved member of the Leading Hotels of the World",5,2022,02,01
147,Outstanding! ⭐️ 🍰☕️,"Wow. What can i say! The Charlie and the chocolate factory themed afternoon tea is a must!🍰☕️ Augustus served us yesterday, and made our whole experience perfect. So attentive! Made sure we had enough food, made sure we constantly had tea, made sure we enjoyed everything we ate and drank. Augustus could not do enough for us.
The gluten free tea is absolutely amazing. You do not need to panic about an cross contamination issues or order issues. The staff are completely on allergies and put you at ease right away so you are completely relaxed.
The food tasted unbelievable! You can tell so much hard work has gone in to every single piece of food you eat.  Even the gluten free food tasted like you would never know any different.
I even got a delicious GF chocolate brownie to finish with a happy birthday on. 
We loved it! Such a treat.
Thank you very much 😊",5,2022,01,30
147,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We went for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea. It was amazing. Augustus was very kind and very attentive to us on our visit. This is definitely worth the money. You will not be disappointed. Food not only tasted lovely but looked great too. Highly recommend.,5,2022,01,29
147,Sublime stay - wonderful in every way!,"From the warm, welcome greeting to the beautiful room to the amazing service and food, everything was absolutely perfect.  Hannah on the front desk is a treasure to deal with, a real asset to your hotel.  It was a special occasion for my son’s 18th and I was so pleased that we booked your hotel as our venue, it really could not have been surpassed.  Thanks to all the team for the work you did in making our stay so pleasurable. ",5,2022,01,28
147,Beautiful food & fantastic service from Augustus,"Visited for Charlie and chocolate factory afternoon tea with my mother on a trip to London to celebrate her birthday. The food was stunning, it not only looked amazing I tasted amazing too the scones were so light and fluffy truly scrumptious!! Augustus our server was wonderful nothing was too much trouble he was very attentive throughout our visit we would highly recommend the service and food and obvs the beautiful teas on offer.",5,2022,01,27
147,Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"Absolutely amazing afternoon tea and felt totally looked after (spoiled in fact) by the staff; in particular our waitress Fanta was so attentive and just so lovely! 
The food was really great - each course was introduced and explained by Fanta and gave us some new foods /tastes to try. 
Love how thoughtfully this afternoon tea had been put together, with little surprises and 'guess the flavour candy floss). 
Loved every second.
This was a wedding anniversary gift bought for us just over 2 years ago - covid kept causing delays but this was well worth waiting for!
Thank you xxx",5,2022,01,22

147,"This is definitely and by far, the best hotel in London","My husband and I were on a break in London, which we do every January and this year stayed  at One Aldwych. Oh my goodness, this is an outstanding hotel ! Every single member of the team were so friendly, helpful and they genuinely wanted us to have an amazing stay. 
One Aldwych is the most beautiful hotel and we couldn’t believe how tranquil we felt inside, sipping delicious cocktails in the bar. The room was totally quiet, we couldn’t hear any traffic or sirens from outside which considering we were in the heart of London was surprising.
The whole stay was faultless and I can understand why this is deservedly, one of the Leading Hotels of the World.
We will definitely be returning again and highly recommend this stunning hotel.
 ",5,2022,01,09
147,My new favourite hotel in London,"What an excellent London hotel, in a brilliant location - literally facing Somerset House.

Firstly, we were upgraded to what appeared to be a brand new, heavenly suite with a fully stocked mini bar in every room.

Secondly, all the staff were beyond helpful
…and breakfast was delicious! 
Thank you One Aldwych!",5,2022,01,06
147,New Year's Eve celebration,"Outstanding stay, New Year's Eve dinner and New Year's breakfast. The staff at the hotel were amazing, they took pride making you feel welcome and delighted. The room was extraordinary, all details, big and small, taken into consideration. The dinner was served with champagne and canapés, then four plates, including dessert. All the plates were sublime and the presentation was outstanding. The breakfast was again delicious, and gluten free, waffles ....
We shall not forget the end and start of the year any time soon. Looking forward to the next occasion ... ",5,2022,01,06
147,Tranquil and cool In the middle of it all,"We stayed one night at One Aldwych which is now going to be one of our ‘go-to’ hotels when visiting London. The location is perfect, within a short distance to Covent Garden and over the river from Waterloo station. It’s right in the heart of everything but inside the rooms are tranquil and quiet.

Our room overlooked the Lyceum Theatre but the glazing is so good that there was not a sound from outside. The room itself was beautiful and well designed.

There is a quiet place for guests (The Library) and we also met friend for cocktails in the buzzy bar. We paid a visit to the spa for a swim and it is a true oasis. Breakfast was also wonderful, excellent service and a peaceful ambience. 

The staff were excellent from the second we were welcomed at the front door (after a soggy walk across the river). 

Highly recommended.",5,2021,12,31
147,AMAZING Charlie  and the chocolate factory lunch!,"What an absolutely fabulous lunch this was! 
Quintessentially british with the sensational celebration of none other than Roald Dahls  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! We absolutely loved it! The sandwiches were delicious and the sweet treats so creative and truly scrumptious!  5 star in every way, the service from Jose was exceptional and the choice of teas incredible! I honestly can’t recommend this enough! One Aldwych is a superb destination hotel and my goodness gracious me with a great lunch like this it’s truly memory making! Loved it!",5,2021,12,30

Lovely touches, stockings on doors Christmas gifts for children. Beautiful food. Worth every penny. We will be back! Loved the health club and the pool.",5,2021,12,26
147,Hospitality at its Best,"I feel I must write how great our recent short stay experience was at this hotel for our wedding anniversary. 
During Covid we have had some horrid experiences from “ so called” hospitality so it was more than refreshing to receive highly professional service at every aspect of our short stay.
The hotel has been completely refurbished during Covid and Wow what a result. Everywhere has a quality feel and looks amazing and every detail has been well thought out.
As it was our anniversary we had champagne and special chocolate treats in the room and also received an upgrade so we were very happy",5,2021,12,18
147,Best stay ever,"My husband and I couldn't be happier with our stay at One Aldwych. The rooms are flawless, with many great amenities (we recommend the Bridge View Suite for an incredible view). On top of the perfectly central location, the staff were unparalleled. They were kind, friendly, accommodating, and went out of their way to remember the small details. Thank you to James, Samuel, Claudia, Harry, Roger and the many others who made our stay so memorable. We will absolutely be staying with you again!",5,2021,11,28
147,Honeymoon,"Perfect 4 night stay for our honeymoon. Gorgeous entrance to the hotel and bar area, beautiful and clean rooms and lovely to have the option of the pool and spa in an excellent location. I had an amazing facial with Tattiana. Close to many of the theatres and only 5-10 minutes walk to Covent Garden. Staff were all lovely and made our stay special, kindly upgraded our room and given a bottle of champagne. Our first time staying at One Aldwych but would definitely book again for a special occasion. ",5,2021,11,24

147,"Wow, wow, wow!!! Cocktails to die for ",We came here after being to see Tina Turner story for cocktails in the hotel bar. They have got to be by far the best cocktails we have tried. All served to a very high standard. Not cheap but well worth it. Service was also spot on with waiter having banter with us all. Great place for after theatre drinks. ,5,2021,11,15
147,Amazing,"Stayed with my sister and 2 15 year old nieces.  Could not fault the hotel, our 2 bed suit was perfect.

Sleep wasn’t great as was far too hot in room. Found the temperature control in morning. That’s on me",4,2021,11,12
147,Great Anniversary,"We stayed during Oct half term with two young children for our 10th anniversary and we all loved our visit. 

The pool was a great treat and the underwater music was fab. The staff in the spa were again amazing and really enjoyed our treatments.

Breakfast was just delicious , the signature hash was yummy. We did have dinner at indigo which again was lovely. Great wine selection and the kids menu was simple and prefect for little ones. On the day of our anniversary we went down to have a few drinks in the cocktail lounge, being a Saturday it was very busy. The staff managed to get a little table however a few minutes later they created a bigger more comfortable table for us without us saying anything. The staff were always one step ahead. 

They really made everything so special we just can’t wait to stay again.",5,2021,11,10
147,Excellent.,"Excellent stay at One Aldwych.  From start to finish staff were unfailingly helpful, friendly and professional. Small touches such as treats for our sons when we arrived made it extra special.  The facilities are wonderful.  We're looking forward to our next trip. ",5,2021,11,06
147,A wonderful stay,"We had a brilliant time — and the One Aldwych team were very attentive. The bar is excellent and the rooms are lovely. I would say that the deluxe bedrooms are a little smaller than I would have thought, but that’s my only minor complaint.",5,2021,11,06
147,Great staff,"Since when you arrive at the Bar you feel welcome, embraced by this particular oval structure and the staff working there. I would like to mention in particular Guillaume who surely sets the example in Bar Service.
See you soon",5,2021,11,02
147,Yet another wonderful stay away,"One Aldwych we absolutely adore staying with you. From the moment you enter the building the doormen remember you by name, as do reception. You are treated with kindness and professionalism and the rooms are modern, warm, neutral and so comfortable. 

The location is perfect, the food and drinks we had were wonderful and little touches like complimentary drinks vouchers and books on making the world a better place just add such lovely detail.  Always a firm favourite of ours when in this area. Highly recommended.",5,2021,11,01

147,Faultless hotel,"We spent four nights here in the middle of October and loved it. It is faultless in all respects from the location, to the modern elegant decor, to the warm, welcoming staff and not forgetting the well equipped gym and gorgeous pool and spa. The bar is popular with a great atmosphere and terrific cocktails. We will definitely come here again.",5,2021,10,18
147,Personalised service,We had a wonderful 2 night stay in October. From start to finish the service was impeccable and we were made to feel very welcome. The location was fantastic and we really enjoyed the spa and pool. We ate in the restaurant Indigo one night which was also lovely. We would definitely return in the future.,5,2021,10,09
147,A wonderful boutique hotel,"I spent my first night a few weeks ago at One Aldwych recently in September and the experience was absolutely flawless. I cannot express how amazingly well managed and run this hotel is. Right from the moment of booking to the final check out it was impeccable.

I had the pleasure of Knowing the new front office manager James from a previous hotel and it was with delight that I have discovered this gem right in the heart of London’s theatre land.  The hotel is a small but nevertheless beautiful boutique hotel. The décor right across the hotel is stunning with artwork and colour right throughout the property. It’s a triangle shaped building but you would not know this inside. The bedroom `I stayed in had a slightly curved wall which gave the room a different (but very positive) feel to the room with lots of lighting that’s controllable from the bedside. And the curtain tracks are electric too!

The moment we I arrived we were greeted by the door staff who were very helpful and pleasant. We were guided to the reception area and were greeted by a very happy and helpful Hanna, the front office duty manager who helped get us checked in. We had arrived around 1.00pm and the room was ready, so we checked straight in. Hanna showed us up to the room which was a superior room and as I previously mentioned was well lit and had very well designed. The bathroom had two sinks and a great use of the space which for the type of room was a real Bonus. There was a shower but no bathtub this might put some guests off, but it was perfect for us for a one night’s stay.

Hanna showed us the features of the room and before leaving us I asked if there was a possibility of a later checkout and she said she would see what could be done to accommodate this.

We had checked I early to make use of the pool, gym, and spa facilities. These are exceptional for the size of the hotel and a real feature. The gym is fully kitted out with both multi gym and free weights along with lots of cardiovascular equipment, so I had a great workout. After a gym session, straight into the chlorine free pool. The pool was empty, and we had the pool to ourselves for over an hour and made good use of the sauna and steam room. We only saw two other guests’ whist there, so it felt like it was an exclusive pool. 

We had cocktails in the bar which were exceptional, and we were given two glasses of champagne as a welcome gift which was very nice indeed! The service was top notch, and the staff were very attentive keeping an eye out so you could not go thirsty.

The breakfast is served on the mezzanine level and again is excellent, the service from the staff was perfect, ensuring you had everything you needed. Great coffee too. After checking with Hanna at reception regarding a later checkout we were happily informed we could have a late checkout which was very well received so we made good use of the spa facilities and my wife booked a massage which was brilliant (so I’m told ) 

All in all, this hotel has an attention to detail that so many hotels miss, and we felt really special on our visit. I would not hesitate to return here and as a tip join the Leaders program to get the full benefits. You will not disappointed.",5,2021,10,09
147,An amazing experience and wonderful staff 5*,"We brought my parents for the Charlie and chocolate factory afternoon tea and then to a show. 

The staff at Old Aldwych were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble, friendly, helpful, accommodating especially as I was in an air boot and without even asking they whisked us round to the lift to take us to our table.    

Special mentions to Jose our waiter who was amazing and the staff made it extra special for our mums birthday.   They even sang happy birthday 🎂 

Another special mention goes out to Dave the security manager who took great care of us whisking us to the lift and making sure we got to our table.    

He even looked after us when we came out of the theatre and invited our elderly parents to sit in their lobby area to wait for our Uber driver 

Not forgetting the wonderful and exciting afternoon tea experience which was delicious 

Thank you everyone for making our day a wonderful experience

5 star exceptional experience",5,2021,09,25

147,A Perfect Few Days,"We have just come home from a wonderful stay at One Aldwych, where we spent the most perfect few days.   From the moment we arrived with the valet parking, through check-in, the wonderfully appointed room, we were made to feel most welcome.   We also availed ourselves of the spa, and the lovely staff there were most welcoming too. 
To celebrate our special 30th Anniversary with you, and the amazing welcome and service we received was an absolute pleasure.  What a perfect few days.
If we could, we would award you more than a 5* review!

147,Best Hotel we’ve ever stayed in,"Thank you to One Aldwych for gifting us a day packed full of treats as part of the #TreatOurNHS competition.  We cannot thank the staff enough for their hospitality. Every single member of staff were so lovely, kind and attentive. We received a warm welcome and was able to check in early. We started off with Charlie & the chocolate factory afternoon tea which was out of this world. We checked in to our hotel which overlooked the Shard and were presented with petit fours which were very indulgent. After making ourself at home, we went to the lobby bar and had some swanky cocktails currently in partnership with floral street which were very tasty! The London poppy was my favourite and they even gave us a miniature perfume of the matching cocktail. The overnight stay was extremely comfortable and the attention to detail was very elegant. We finished off with breakfast in the Indigo restaurant the following morning which was also very nice. Starting off with fresh juice, coffee and toast with jams and honey followed by a full English! We planned on going to the pool but was too cosy in our room to leave, however it looked very relaxing. 

although I probably wouldn’t be able to afford £600 a room a night working for the NHS, for anyone that wants to stay in a London hotel for special occasion, I would highly recommend it. The service was amazing and it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in!

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!",5,2021,09,16

Thank you for a great experience and my mum loved it she says the best tea for two that she done. We have done a lot of tea for two.",5,2021,09,13
147,Quality through and through,"We came here for afternoon tea with another couple. From the moment we walked through the door we were impressed. First and foremost we would like to say how attentive and accommodating the staff were. Thank you especially to Daniel who served our afternoon tea. 
The food was exceptional and, in my opinion, one of the best afternoon teas we have had in London. The cocktails were perfection and quite potent. Of course with this level of quality there comes a hefty bill but it was money well spent.",5,2021,09,12
147,Charlie and The Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time at One Aldwych for the themed afternoon tea.  The staff are fantastic from the lovely gentleman on the door to the lady at the booking in desk and the lovely waiting staff. The afternoon tea was unbelievably brilliant

147,"Gorgeous hotel, brilliant staff, excellent location!!","Absolutely brilliant hotel, only stayed there for one night but could not fault it. The staff were incredibly friendly, on check in we were met by Alex who checked us in, showed us to our room and was incredibly friendly and cheerful.

The room was stunning and more than exceeded our expectations and the bathroom was fantastic! 

There is a spa and pool which we didn't get the chance to try out but on a future visit we definitely will.

Myself and our partner definitely plan to stay again and have already been recommending the place. ",5,2021,08,24
147,"Beautiful rooms, exceptional service, great 5* Hotel in central London","Overall a great 5 star hotel in the heart of London.

We visited for a weekend in August. We arrived slightly before checkin time and our room was ready and we were offered a 4pm checkout which was nice. 

We were shown to our room by Alex on reception who showed us how to use everything in the room and explained all about the hotel facilities. Our bags arrived within minutes from the porters on the doors.

We used the pool, sauna and steam room which was quite and relaxing for London.

The lobby bar was a lovely place to grab a drink before heading out. We had drinks here both evenings. There was a young gent in the bar who’s service was also exceptional (he was wearing a pink shirt). I didn’t catch his same but nothing was too much trouble. 

Breakfast is wonderful we ate in the restaurant one morning and had it in our room the other. Great good options cooked to order and again brilliant service. 

Beautiful rooms, exceptional service, great 5* Hotel in central London. Thanks for making our stay special.",5,2021,08,23
147,An Amazing Hotel with Wonderful Staff.,"I have just returned from an overnight stay at the fabulous One Aldwych Hotel. It was my daughter’s 18th birthday and we wanted to mark the occasion with a stay in London. The hotel is a visually stunning Edwardian building that was refurbished in 2019. The interiors are beautiful, elegant, light and pristine, filled with a wealth of exciting artwork and stunning floral displays. The lobby bar is of particular note with its magnificent arched windows-it’s a ‘must’ for a signature cocktail or a glass of champagne. Our rooms were very spacious, extremely well appointed and tastefully decorated. The beds were large and extraordinarily comfortable with luxurious linens. I didn’t want to get up in the morning! There is a lovely pool and spa in the basement but sadly our time was whipped away from us with our celebrations and we didn’t get to use these facilities. The location of the hotel is excellent. Very centrally placed, a few meters from the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden and easily accessible to all the major attractions via public transport or Uber. However, it is not purely the majesty, beauty and location of this hotel that makes it deserving of its 5 star rating- it is the quality of the staff that makes this hotel excel. Every member of staff we had contact with went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. The reception team- who were extremely friendly and welcoming- contacted me prior to our arrival to ensure the beds were set up appropriately for our family and made sure the rooms were ready for our early arrival. We were treated to complimentary cocktails to celebrate my daughter’s birthday, and a beautiful handmade cake was waiting in the room for her. It felt like nothing was too much trouble, from the doorman and bar staff to reception and housekeeping (lovely turn down service!) everyone was exceedingly personable, professional and slick- the staff are a credit to this lovely hotel, and I would not hesitate to return and recommend it unreservedly- we had a wonderful stay.",5,2021,08,14
147,Perfection,"We have just spent 4 nights on a return visit as a family of 3 including our 9 year old daughter to celebrate a belated birthday.  Having stayed in several 5* hotels around the world One Aldwych was once again faultless and outshone the rest.
We arrived on Monday very early due to train issues and without delay were allowed access to our room, receiving a grateful room upgrade. Upon arrival we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and cake as a birthday gift which was special to us.
The staff across the whole hotel could not do enough for us from our initial meeting with reception to waiting, concierge, bar, spa and housekeeping staff. Nothing was any trouble for them and you could tell they were glad to be back open. Our room was newly refurbished, very spacious and it was actually recognised there were 3 of us and our daughter was given her own robe and slippers which delighted her. We never ate in the restaurant of an evening however the breakfast selection and quality was excellent again served with a smile.
It was the simple but memorable touches that delivered, the staff took their time to get to know us and always addressed us by name including our daughters first name.
Our last day again due to train issues meant our departure from the hotel was late evening. Without hesitation reception allowed us to keep our room until we needed to, again complimentary.
We will certainly be returning to this impressive, thoughtful and luxurious hotel.

147,Exam Celebrations - Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing experience from start to finish. Charlie and chocolate Afternoon Tea. Food was stunning and was plentiful, presentation of everything was so memorable. This visit was to celebrate outstanding exam results and she was made to feel very special.

A loud shout out goes to Fanta, our waitress who made it so memorable.",5,2021,08,13
147,The best hotel in central London!,"We just stayed one night for a friend's birthday party which was in the hotel.  The staff were so helpful and friendly and made us feel at home.  We really appreciated the early check in and late check out.
The breakfast was superb and overall it was a great experience.",5,2021,08,09
147,Willy Wonkas Afternoon Tea,"What can I not say about this…. Had an amazing afternoon. Augustus looked after us so well. I bought my mother and daughter down for a belated birthday treat,tying this in with a theatre visit. The food was awesome and the cocktails spectacular. Nothing was ever to much trouble. My daughter didn’t like the cake they bought out so they swapped it and made sure she left smiling. They really made a fuss of the birthday girls. I cannot recommend this experience highly enough. 

All the staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful. We arrived in a downpour and the reception staff helped us through the hotel to get to where we needed to be without going back out into the rain. 

I will be back. Thank you again 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2021,08,07
147,Superb Hotel 10/10 immaculate,"Superb Hotel. Exquisite design inside and out. Our suite Was equipped with every creature comfort. The artwork in the common areas and in the hotel rooms along with the gorgeous floral arrangements and architecture make this a truly beautiful place. The staff is beyond compare. From the moment we entered the hotel, We were greeted with kindness, consideration graciousness efficiency and professionalism. This is one of my favorite hotels. It’s wonderfully located near Covent Garden and  theater  & close to the British Museum & Opera house. The workout facilities and pool and rooftop bar along with the incredible afternoon tea of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory are top favorites. Our stay included breakfast. Rather than having to eat breakfast down in the restaurant we were offered the option of room service which was incredible. Again, excellent food choice quality and service. Everything served on time without exception. Make sure to book the  afternoon tea in advance of your stay. It does not disappoint. I actually miss the people in this hotel and staying in this lovely place during this horrendous pandemic. They made our stay perfect. I have no comments on how they could improve, that’s how totally impressed I was with this hotel and staff.",5,2021,08,05
147,Died & Gone to Heaven !!,"One Aldwych - fabulous hotel, it was always lovely but it’s  had a major refurbishment and is even better if that were possible. We’re staying here for 2 x nights and it’s been a dream - it’s been an impossible  18 months for all of us - as an NHS key worker it’s been full on without a break, it’s been so lovely. Staff amazing and so kind  - food amazing - cosmo’s amazing !!! bedrooms are divine . The best bed linen ever - that’s important and  every conceivable thing has been thought of - love it love it. We’ve just totally chilled out and relaxed and fine absolutely nothing ! How good is that !!!",5,2021,08,05
147,Perfect Stay,"I had the pleasure of staying at One Aldwych to celebrate an anniversary and I was absolutely blown away by how beautiful the hotel and every little detail was. Having said that, I must declare that it was the very attentive and warm staff who made the stay truly memorable. The hotel has one of the best set of sustainability initiatives that I have ever seen and sets the benchmark for other hotels to follow. A favorite fact was that several cocktails including an award-winning one use the honey extracted from the rooftop bee garden. The gym was also one of the best and fully-equipped hotel gyms I have come across with a full range of equipment to cover all exercises and workouts. Zilbe was one of the best waiters I have had who took us on a delicious culinary journey at Indigo and made us feel very special and taken care of. Hanna and Claudia were exceptional hosts as well as Luis and Aldrich from the lobby bar. There was also a young gentleman from concierge who I didn't manage to retrieve his name but he was also very welcoming and attentive. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2021,08,05
147,A truely special birthday celebration and overnight experience in this amazing hotel,"I hired a private room for 28 of us to celebrate my birthday party. I also spent one night in the hotel and, on arrival, was told we had been upgraded to their Waterloo Bridge Suite which was absolutely stunning! 
The private room, on the ground floor, was perfect for my needs with soft furnishing and carpets at the upper level and wooden floor at the lower level for dancing later on in the evening. The Canapes were delicious and staff on the night were extremely friendly and professional.
The following day we took advantage of their 4pm check out and had a wonderful 90 minutes in the Spa.
Of course I expect fantastic food and service in a hotel of this quality however the friendliness and professionalism of the staff really stood out for me. They really made us feel at home and I hope to see them again soon.",5,2021,08,04
147,Very good venue,"Returned 17 years after holding my 40th birthday party for a friends 60th. Delighted to say that we had a lovely time with friendly, attentive staff and a wide selection of drinks and cocktails. Only slightly bothered that the room hired was a bit cramped for the number of guests but that didn't spoil the excellent ambiance of the occasion. Good food was served and highly recommend this venue in the heart of London.",4,2021,08,02
147,Fabulous Hotel,"Absolutely fabulous stay at this hotel. All the staff so friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the cocktails were delicious. We had breakfast which was excellent and the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating.

We also managed to use the spa which was such a lovely place to unwind, I particularly loved the steam room. We can’t wait to return.",5,2021,08,01
147,In love,"What a gorgeous hotel.  The staff are so warm and welcoming. There's a calm atmosphere all around the place. The Lobby Bar is beautiful and grand, huge arched windows and striking flower arrangements, not forgetting the lovingly crafted cocktails. Rooms are very beautiful, lovely touches, we slept so well. We didn't stay for dinner but judging by the breakfast I imagine it to be a wonderful dining experience.  I wish I could wake up here again tomorrow. 

Thank you so much for your hospitality and making it so special.",5,2021,08,01

147,Charlie and Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea,"Have just experienced Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea.
Service was fabulous, the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating. The food was beautiful, with seconds offered. Loved the chocolate tea. Perfect dark hit after drinking. Even though you have a 2 hour time slot, you are not pushed out of the door at the end of the meal. Felt very indulgent. Highly recommend",5,2021,07,29
147,Spot on!,"We had a small Suite. It was a reasonable size and had everything you might want. Clean, bright, tastefully decorated. Good bathroom, good shower.
The chlorine free 18m pool is very nice to lounge by or swim in. We did both.
The location is spot on for London tourists. Leave the front door in any direction and you can be somewhere special.
However, what makes the place exceptional is its staff. Having travelled the world staying in some of its better hotels, rarely have a hotel's staff been so friendly, welcoming and good at what they do.
With apologies to some wonderful people whose names we did not catch, a special thanks to Claudia and Agostinho.",5,2021,07,26
147,An excellent hotel with superb service,A beautiful hotel set in the best part of London. The service from staff was excellent and they made our young children feel really welcome. Cocktails in the bar are excellent and the food overall was delicious.,4,2021,07,26

Staff very friendly too",5,2021,07,25
147,Perfect in every way,"The second time we have stayed and sadly it was only one night this time round. We stayed in a corner suite with additional bedroom, creating a two bedroom suite. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, nothing was too much trouble. 

We ordered room service but food which wasn’t on the menu - no problem. Breakfast is full table service of pretty much anything you desire. 

All the staff without exception were cheerful, thoughtful, friendly and professional. 

If I had to think of a negative it would only be that the pool is quite chilly, but it didn’t affect our overall experience. 

Very very pleased and we will definitely return in the not too distant future hopefully.",5,2021,07,21
147,Casual drinks with lovely staff,After having some bad experiences earlier in the evening we were over joyed to find a nice lounge bar with such friendly staff. Everyone had a smile on their faces and the general atmosphere was relaxing for a few drinks. We ordered a couple of cocktails with fresh garnishes and were greeted with nuts and olives on the house. We could only get a seat by the front desk but the lady offered us a table nearer the bar as soon as it became available. Would absolutely go back and it made me consider staying at the hotel next time too.,5,2021,07,19
147,Amazing Hotel - Perfect Birthday Treat,"My boyfriend and I love coming to One Aldwych, and our recent trip to celebrate my birthday was no exception. From the moment we arrived the staff were really friendly and wanted to make sure everything was perfect for us.
The room was spectacular; with lovely homemade honeycomb as a treat, our own lounge area and fantastic views. During our trip we used the spa facilities, had a brilliant tasting menu dinner in Indigo's (thank you so much for finding me some superglue to fix my shoes!), many a drink in the Lobby Bar, and a spectacular gluten and dairy free afternoon tea.
Every single staff member at the hotel is brilliant; providing immaculate service and a warm welcome. We can't wait to return again soon.",5,2021,07,18
147,Amazing Afternoon Tea and Service!,"Such a fun concept for afternoon tea. The service was amazing we had Fanta as our waitress and truly made the experience so much better. She was super friendly and funny and explained everything to us as there are so many different options of food and some you really need to get your head around the flavours! But that’s what made it so fun!

You can have more of any foods you like which we did take advantage of with the savouries however when the chocolate and sweet options came out we regretted it as there was so much choice and plenty of everything! You can also have multiple flavours of tea which take the advantage of as there was some flavour we had never had before. 

Would highly recommend booking it is very good value for money and a great birthday idea.",5,2021,07,17
147,5 star intimate cocoon in the centre of London,"We’ve been coming to One Aldwych for 20 years. It’s a very special hotel in the centre of London. The friendly staff, exceptional service and very personal touches are what makes it way above any other hotels we have been privileged to stay at in London (including The Savoy, Hamm Yard, The Rosewood etc). We come here to celebrate our wedding anniversaries and special birthdays and are always impressed with the staff and service. Exceptional personal and professional touches. The recent refurbishment is also excellent. We very highly recommend it.",5,2021,07,10
147,Out of this world afternoon tea!,"Out of this world afternoon tea! 

The service was amazing by all staff but a huge thank you to FANTA! She was friendly and attentive throughout our experience. One of the best customer service experiences  I have ever had 🤩

So much food and even bring you extras, lots of choice of hot drinks and SO much chocolate 🍫 🥰 

Would highly recommend going here for an afternoon tea in London BOOK NOW 😊",5,2021,07,09
147,Cocktail  Paradise,"
I came for a few cocktails for a very anticipated catch up with some friends and we loved every single bit of it.
We were warmly welcomed by Gosha who took the time to explain us the menu and recommend some drinks.
I had the Negroni, expertly made by the Marco whilst my friends insisted in having the One Fashioned which is served table side.
Unbeknownst to us the trolley itself was designed by an award winning mixologist that was kind enough to roll it over and perform the drink table side for us!
We loved it and can’t wait to come back.",5,2021,07,05
147,Friendly staff go above and beyond at this 5 star hotel!,"This hotel lives up to the five star rating. The rooms are beautifully decorated and there are small thoughtful details everywhere, but what really makes this place exceptional are the people. Everyone we came into contact with - Chris, Hanna, Claudia, the housekeeping crew, Tatjana in the spa - everyone was friendly, kind, chatty and couldn’t do enough to make our stay memorable. We will definitely be coming back and I’ll be recommending this hotel to others.",5,2021,07,02
147,It’s nice to come back!,This was our first trip into London for 18 months. We were celebrating birthdays and we were welcomed back like family. Their arrangements for the current Covid situation were well organised. But the real joy was the level of service and comfort that we received from the start to the finish of our stay. We especially enjoyed the lovely room service team for breakfast ( thanks to Gordon!) and for evening snacks. We have stayed here many times for over 10 years. They continue to have earned our loyalty. And..it still has our favourite hotel bar!,5,2021,06,28
147,Pretty amazing everything,"It's not often that you can find a place that nice to be in, the food is excellent and all the staff are delightful so when I find this I have to review.

I bid in a charity auction in 2019 for 'high tea' for two at One Aldwych and was successful in winning it.  I had been there before before retirement for a few business lunches/coffee etc so I knew the venue you be impressive, but I had never been there with my wife or to have High Tea.

Of course we had to cancel the first booking because of Covid and then again with the second.  1st shout out is to the admin staff who were so helpful, rang back when they promised to do so and re-arranged without any fun at all.

Today we finally got there for our Tea.   The 1st thing I noticed was how good and friendly the staff were - to the guy on the front door who showed us to the lift/stairs to the fist floor and then the waiting staff.  Real joy, they were that good.

The food (which is all gluten and dairy free) was excellent (I especially enjoyed the savoury course).  I was a tad nervous about the food being all gluten/dairy free as my daughter is a celiac and sometimes her food is quite naff to be honest.  But I honestly could not tell at all.

The restaurant itself was still very impressive and super clean.

A lovely 1st dining experience in London since the pandemic started - we certainly got off to a good start.  Thanks One Aldwych!",5,2021,06,27
147,Such a great afternoon tea for a birthday!,"We came to the One Aldwych for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory inspired afternoon tea for my friends birthday and it was amazing!! The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly and they catered to my dietary requirements which is a huge plus (they have separate menus to cater a lot of allergies which is great!) 
The food was amazing, and I loved that we could have more if we wanted to. I loved everything about our experience and would gladly come again! Highly highly recommend. 
Also, if you get served by Augustus then you are truly lucky, he was so friendly, attentive and welcoming and made our visit even more special. Thank you so much Augustus!!",5,2021,06,26
147,Fantastic weekend anniversary stay,"My wife and I haven't been to the One Aldwych for a long time, but we certainly will be looking for an excuse to come back as soon as we can. The service was amazing as usual, and the upgrade we received was as amazing as it was unexpected. The attention to detail, from the honeycomb from the bees on the roof, to the petals on the bed and bath that awaited us on our return from dinner, are second to none. Breakfast was wonderful, so relaxed. The Negronis at the bar were great too! It was a treat, Thank you.",5,2021,06,26
147,Truly memorable birthday surprise in an amazing hotel!,"I was surprised with a 3 night stay in this hotel for my birthday by my husband and he couldn't have chosen much better!  He is the master of surprises but  I believe even before we arrived, the staff, particularly Annalisa, played a huge part in organising the details that he wanted to include.  He was extremely impressed with her input and work.  
I was aware of the hotel. as my husband's original booking for last year had to be cancelled due to the Covid situation but I had no idea of the standard until we arrived.  We were made to feel so genuinely welcome I felt a little emotional when we checked in, maybe I was bit overwhelmed but the reception staff were so professional but friendly.  It was Claudia, the concierge that checked us in and showed us to our room.  We were upgraded to a suite, Loft Suite number 600, and it was gorgeous.  I really felt that Claudia was as pleased for us be there as we were, she was lovely.  She was professional and helpful without being intrusive.  The lounge area had 3 good size windows so had lots of natural light, there was complimentary Macaroons and Honeycomb on the coffee table as well.  The bedroom and bathroom were equally luxurious, very fresh, modern with a lovely finish.  It was immaculately clean  and comfortable.  Our housekeeper was so helpful and friendly as well.  We had lunch after we arrived then after a little confusion over the dinner service we ordered from the Indigo Menu.  We had a slightly faltering start on the meal but after if was rectified it was delicious and our hiccup was dealt with efficiently by the staff.  
I love to swim and made full use of the pool in the spa area.  Fantastic facilities in the changing room.  Gorgeous products were available to use and I loved the Dyson hairdryer!  Once again, super friendly, helpful and welcoming staff every time I went to swim,  a really relaxed environment and great size pool for a hotel spa.  
During our stay we interacted on numerous occasions with Andrew and Chris on the concierge team.  Such genuine Londoners which was great.   Chris was also really helpful if we wanted some information but we has some good inciteful chats with him too.  We really hope that business in London starts to pick up because these are great team members that are itching to be busy and doing what they do best.
The Wednesday of our stay was my actual birthday and when we returned to our room after breakfast I discovered someone had crept in with a Lemon and Blueberry birthday cake piped with my pet name ( given up by my husband, he even asked for my favourite flavour) and some fresh strawberries.  As a surprise to us both, there was also a bottle of champagne on ice from the hotel.  This was a gift that kept on giving...
That particular night, the hotel had helped my husband to book another restaurant for my birthday meal which was also fantastic.  Because we ate elsewhere, the next day they helped us to package the cake and strawberries to take home.  
This is a top hotel in London so comes with a high price tag but it was so worth it.  We couldn't recommend it highly enough.  All of the staff were wonderful and totally made our stay extra special.  I was thoroughly spoilt and it is a break that I will remember for all the right reasons.",5,2021,06,25
147,Out of this world ,"Wow sums up our stay. From start to finish nothing was too much trouble for any of the team. We stayed as a belated 50th birthday trip for my husband. We where made to feel very special especially our 12 year old. The room was immaculate and so well designed,  the breakfast was just amazing. We had charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea and where completely blown away by the attention to detail and the most amazing flavours. Let's hope my husband treats me with another trip for my 50th....I have never stayed at a more amazing hotel.",5,2021,06,21
147,Amazing Birthday Experience,"We came to London for our little girls 7th birthday and had booked Charlie and the chocolate factory Afternoon Tea at One Aldwych Hotel, it was an amazing experience for all of us, adults and children.
We were graced by Fanta who served us and kept us filled in with plenty food and drinks, we then were surprised by the cocktail master trolley who showed us all the magic behind the fabulous cocktails, and the cherry at the top of the cake was when Augustus showed up with a mini birthday cake and sang happy birthday with us ... you can imagine how special our little girl felt! 
I can't recommend this place enough!! 
Well done Augustus, Fanta and the Cocktail Trolley Master! x",5,2021,06,21
147,Best afternoon tea ever!!,We came to London for a girlie weekend and booked the Willy Wonka afternoon tea at One Aldwych London. Our server for the afternoon was Augustus (his actual real name!) He couldn’t do enough for us and made sure we always had plenty of food and drinks during our time there. I can’t recommend this place enough!,5,2021,06,05
147,Fun and filling afternoon tea,"Managed to get a booking for wife’s birthday.  Is definitely a little different to the traditional afternoon tea.  Both kids enjoyed it too!

Savouries served first with some interesting flavours like the salmon and beetroot macaroon (it does work!).

Cocktails are fun too, with a bit of theatre.  Kids versions available.

Finally the sweet selection.  Really tasty.  Also a vegetarian selection available.  There are traditional scones but again some unusual treats too.

Not cheap but probably about usual for afternoon tea in london",5,2021,05,29
147,Afternoon Tea,Went for the Charlie and the chocolate factory themed afternoon tea and it definitely didn't disappoint. The savoury dishes were fabulous and it was good not filling up on lots of bread before the main attraction  (for me anyway).  The cakes were varied and creative and tasted every bit as good as they looked. The presentation was first class and the service was faultless. They also offer a vegetarian/vegan option. Can't recommend this too highly - it was definitely worth a trip in to London,5,2021,05,20
147,Business Stay,"Very warm greeting by staff and concierge - a home from home. Extremely comfortable room and amenities and great to get back into the gym before breakfast. 
Fantastic cocktails on offer in the beautiful and iconic lobby bar, followed by a good nights sleep!",5,2020,12,21
147,Super lovely staff who made us feel so welcome,"This has been such a long year and we wanted to give the kids a treat so we decided to visit the pool facilities at One Aldwych. Covid guidelines means you get one hour to yourself with only one bubble allowed in the pool. We showed up on a weekend morning drenched to the bone from the downpour with 3 and 5 year olds, and the staff couldn’t be lovelier. The space is immaculate and super clean: changing room, pool, and showers. Jane at reception was so friendly and made visiting a 5 star hotel with small children less intimidating. We had an amazing time and felt like life was normal again. Cannot wait for covid restrictions to be a thing of the past and try their afternoon tea.",5,2020,12,18
147,"Stunning room, friendly service, ideal location.","My stay at One Aldwych was a complete delight. I checked in in a rush, whilst in the middle of a phone call, and the staff could not have been more understanding and helpful. From the receptionists to the bar and restaurant staff, they were friendly - but not intrusive - and nothing was too much trouble. My room was stunning, with every amenity and comfort; very glamorous but very comfortable. I have to just highlight here that it was the best hotel lighting I have ever come across - there was not a harsh fluorescent to be found!

The hotel was ideally located for everything I wanted to do in London. And the breakfast in Indigo was delicious (particularly the croissants!). 

Lastly, Covid - I felt very safe. There were clearly a lot of stringent health and safety regulations in place but it never felt like they were being imposed.",5,2020,12,15
147,Amazing people,"We stayed for 3 nights in this exceptional 5-star city hotel. We couldn’t have had a better stay. 
Instead of writing about all the good things about the hotel, I think it’s worth just mentioning the amazing staff. Each and every one of them made us feel special. If you want exceptional and friendly service, this the hotel for you. 
",5,2020,12,13
147,Excellent value and exquisite service ,"I would 100% recommend this property and restaurant for really great service stylish decor in a really handy location next to theatre land.

Cocktail mixologist outstanding for drinks in the Lobby bar
Indigo restaurant for both Dinner and Breakfast was superb
Renovated hotel room was luxurious.
One of the best hotels I have stayed in with service to match",5,2020,12,08
147,Fantastic Charlie & Chocolate factory afternoon tea experience ,"We had a afternoon tea as a treat for children aged  9 and 11
The staff go above and beyond.. every single staff member from the moment we arrived was excellent. Doorman included .
I recommend you order a child’s cocktail.. the children make it themselves ( along with the waiter ) with dry ice .. our kids loved it !!
The tea was Charlie and the chocolate factory themed .. and we all enjoyed it . 
We then went for a walk to covent garden to see the lights and trees. A lovely Christmas treat ! 
It isn’t cheap but really well worth it . Especially this year when the things we can do are more limited .",5,2020,12,06
147,Lovely Staycation,"Stayed with my wife and three children and it was such a lovely stay. 
The staff take care of your every need and go above and beyond to make you feel pampered. The architecture of the hotel deserves a special mention
We stayed in one of the suites, beautifully designed and very spacious. Suite With sleek modern and traditional touches. They have a great pool downstairs with steam room, this makes the stay even better. Afternoon tea in the restaurant is a must, the children absolutely loved it. Would highly recommend.",5,2020,11,08
147,Amazing Stay At One Aldwych,"We had an amazing stay at One Aldwych, all the staff members were very helpful and friendly. Food was amazing at the Charlie and The Chocolate Afternoon Tea. Gorgeous cocktails in the Lobby Bar. The swimming pool is lovely. Bedroom was gorgeous. Highly Reccoomend!",5,2020,11,06
147,Great stay,The staff go above and beyond. Nothing is too much bother. Breakfast room service was very good. Room and common areas including pool / sauna very clean!! Pool is large and social distancing measures made it all very enjoyable. ,5,2020,11,03
147,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for a special occasion for our daughter’s 16th Birthday. The experience really couldn’t have been bettered - from the welcome at the door by name before we had even uttered ours, to the upgrade, complimentary drinks and cake at dinner (see separate review for Indigo - also excellent). Yes, the building is iconic with a lovely recent refurb and some superb and individual rooms, but it is the staff that really make the difference. We enjoyed the pool, lovely food and drinks, and a potter round Covent Garden before we sadly had to say goodbye, but mid-afternoon thanks to a welcome late-checkout. Tip: book by phone rather than on the internet and the staff will then understand your needs even better. We have stayed in some lovely hotels around the world but it is great to know there are still such wonderful places on our doorstep. Highly recommended.",5,2020,10,31
147,Perfection,"I arrived at the hotel and from the second the doorman greeted me by name I knew I was in for a special stay. The staff couldn't have done more for me. The suite was perfect and spacious for my work meeting and due to a surprise win the hotel even delivered complimentary champagne. An establishment of class. 
",5,2020,10,31
147,Amazing hotel with amazing staff!!,"My wife and I recently stayed here for my birthday for 2 nights. We have stayed in some lovely hotels in London but this is up there and could even be our new number 1!! We were treated to an amazing suite and from there on it just kept going. Birthday treats and cocktails!! The staff get a huge thumbs up! I am not going to list the names but you all made the stay one of our best trips to London. From the the lovely ladies at check in, the bar team, the spa ladies, the guy at breakfast and the doormen/concierge team!! You all know who you are!! We are planning our next trip and hoping to spend a couple of days over the Xmas period. Fingers crossed we can! Thanks guys for the great few days!!",5,2020,10,29
147,Very safe staying,"I were made to feel very special from the moment we arrived to our departure the following day. The quality of the service is exemplary, and on par with high end hotels we have visited across the world The room was amazing with attention to detail and staff made you feel important ! Staff is warm, attentive, discreet, and mindful of guests' special requests!",5,2020,10,27
147,"The best hotel stay, ever!","I stayed here with my best friend a few weeks ago and it was without doubt the best hotel stay we have ever had. 

From start to finish the service was impeccable and the staff truly made you feel so welcome.

The hotel itself is gorgeous and is very clean too. Our room was the Somerset Suite and it was the most gorgeous room I have ever seen. The furnishing was perfect, the room was bright and airy and may I add the suite was HUGE. 

In the bathrooms they had little packs with hand wipes, masks, antibacterial gel and sprays and it all came in a clear plastic bag which is perfect for the plane! 

We had the afternoon tea also which was epic and I would highly recommend that. The cocktail bar is gorgeous also and is well worth a visit even if you aren’t staying there too. ",5,2020,10,22
147,One night date night,"We got to the hotel and we’re welcomed warmly. Shown to our room. Everything explained. Big room. Great view. Fantastic location-if London slightly surreal at the moment!! Everything worked well, very comfortable. Felt very well looked after.",5,2020,10,16
147,5th birthday treat,"Wow, such a great hotel. Staff so welcoming and friendly - so good with our granddaughter, always remembering her name from checking to checkout. Great touches like proving drawings to do while waiting for dinner, kids menu. Great location; would recommend the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea for kids and adults.",5,2020,10,04
147,One word - INCREDIBLE! ,"There are simply not enough words to describe how amazing this hotel is. Not only is it visually beautiful, but for me, the heart and soul of One Aldwych are the fabulous staff. We were totally taken care of from the moment we arrived, to the moment we left and nothing was too much trouble. We were supposed to be going abroad but, like many, our holiday has been cancelled. The experience at One Aldwych made up for that, and some. Everything is spotlessly clean, the rooms are amazing and the food was wonderful. Thank you so much, we will definitely be staying again ❤️",5,2020,09,26
147,Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea,"We booked afternoon tea at One Aldwych for my daughters birthday. What a lovely afternoon. The theme was Charlie and the chocolate factory and my daughter loved every second. Very well thought out afternoon tea with some nice surprises. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. 
It is on the pricey side but well worth it in my opinion. 
Service was outstanding.",5,2020,09,21
147,Anniversary stay,"We have just returned from an amazing 2 night stay at this hotel, my husband and I and my brother and sister and their partners, all I can say is a massive thank you to all the staff for making this a great weekend. 
From check in to check out nothing was too much trouble, and every member of staff we encountered were so helpful and nice they could not have been better, from the welcome bottle of champagne and cake  in our room, to the petals around our bath and on our bed to celebrate our anniversary and the extended check out they gave us, was fab!
The hotel had only recently reopened and in these worrying times we felt so safe with the spotlessly clean hotel and the extra safety precautions they had implemented great job.. 
We visit London a lot and generally stay else where, but now this hotel will be our go to, in fact we have already planned our next visit, see you soon One Aldwych and thank you! ",5,2020,09,21
147,Amazing Silver Wedding Anniversary ,"We booked for a night here on the first day they reopened to celebrate our anniversary. Everyone at the hotel were so friendly and great, we couldn't fault anything. They upgraded us to the magnificent Dome Suite and we had treats to make our day so special. The lounge is beautiful, with delicious cocktails. 
We booked a spa treatment each, which was so relaxing and along with everything else, perfect.
Dinner at Indigo restaurant was great, as was breakfast; being Coeliac it is nice to go somewhere and not to worry about being gluten free. Indigo is totally gluten and dairy free, but still the highest quality.
Thank you to everyone for making our Silver Wedding Anniversary so special.",5,2020,09,17
147,Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations,"Stayed here for our anniversary in early March- just before lock down. The hotel was juts a dream to stay in- the staff are highly professional but very friendly and welcoming at the same time including providing an unexpected special desert as part of our anniversary meal.
My wife is coeliac, so we really enjoyed the separate restuarant in the hotel offering a coeliac only menu- my wife was overjoyed to know that she could select from everything on the menu!
The food was of a very high quality and the cocktail bar, whilst quiet due to the corona situation was enjoyable and very relaxing to be in after trips out in the day.
When the current madness is over whenever we go to London and want to stay overnight this is where we'll be staying
The hotel is great but it's the exceptional staff throughout the hotel at every level that makes this a place we would come back to again and again",5,2020,04,18
147,Outstanding customer service!,"We had a reservation at the One Aldwych for next month. Due to the restrictions imposed  on travels from Canada, we had to cancel our trip.  We had a non-refundable deposit which I was sure would be lost. When I informed them that we needed to cancel, after inquiring as to what the reason was, but without my even requesting a refund,  they went ahead and advised us that they would proceed to a complete refund!  Even though we couldn't experience the hotel premises this time around, I can testify that their customer service is nothing short of outstanding, so I really wanted to share this review because they sure deserve it. We are looking forward to visiting the One Aldwych!",5,2020,03,17
147,Best hotel ever,WoW !  Been a treat to experience this hotel and it was just great from arrival til departure.  I could not fault anything !  From management to housekeeping can all be very proud of this hotel !  Rooms were great and spacious with all amenities needed and for sure a ladies touch !  ,5,2020,03,16
147,Amazing Service,I booked this hotel for my 40th birthday and was amazed by the level of customer service this hotel staff provides. I was in love with the lavish decorations and comfortable bedding and pillows. Felt like sleeping in a cloud. Would definitely stay here again! ,5,2020,03,15
147,Charlie and the chocolate factory ,"The afternoon tea was a truly magic experience 
It was a great way to challenge what you see and what you taste
The tea selections were great
The service was of the highest level and attention to detail was great 
Beautiful!!",5,2020,03,11
147,Great hotel-let down by the plumbing!,"Good, central location and a warm welcome from the very efficient front of house team.Lovely bar-great cocktails!! 
Our room was small, but very well designed and spotless. However, the plumbing was extremely noisy which wasn't great at night. 

 ",4,2020,03,09
147,IDEAL,"From the moment I checked in to the check out, my stay was just ideal and perfect. The Front Desk team, was so nice and professional. Discovering my room 214, was a memorable moment as I felt instantly relaxed in such a zen environnement with beautifully and understated colors and wood flooring a big plus. The bed and linen were just great for perfect sleep. The room service food was so fresh and tasty. Filtered water provided is such a thoughtful attention. Total silence at night is such a treat. I visited the beautiful pool and regret not having time to use it. All made for a wonderful, if too short, stay and I just hope I can come back one day...Thank you for providing for such a flawless, chic and serene atmosphere.
Best,
Jean-Paul CHAILLET ",5,2020,03,08
147,"Great location, wonderful service!","Thoroughly enjoyed my five day stay for work and was impressed by the high level of service displayed.  The rooms were spacious, well equipped and clean. The personalized cards and treats I received throughout my stay there were very well appreciated. Well done and keep it up! ",5,2020,03,03
147,Wonderful an oasis of luxury.,"Wonderful and so peaceful. Beds to die for so comfortable. Service excellent and discrete. Breakfast a treat, the greek yoghurt portion would have fed a family, fruit delicious. Late night drinks in the bar was such fun the staff could not have been more helpful. We will definitely be back. ",5,2020,03,01
147,Excellent weekend,"Before you get to the door, it's open. That's after the team of hotel staff who are holding the door open for you, have parked your car. The moment you walk in the staff are falling over themselves to make you feel welcome. Whether to greet you or relieve you of your luggage. As you walk in you are shown the scenery of the Cafe before you get to the reception and check-in and the family can all back me up on it's sheer magnificence, considering having an entire magnolia tree as a centerpoint. We were wondering how it could possibly improve from here. We were not disappointed.
The room was supreme with all the comforts you could possibly need including a sizeable TV, Dyson hair-dryer or minibar. There was an attention to detail that we wouldn't find in our own house, from the lighting to the materials used in it's construction. One Aldwych offers it's own pool, gym, and spa found underground. The Eneko restaurant was an experience in itself with an uncontested understanding of Spanish food, yet with a unique take on it.
Being situated in the center of London, this hotel carries an incredible reputation which is bestowed on you in every possible aspect. Not being a chain means that you get a level of service that is almost imaginary before visiting. Looking forward to visiting again!",5,2020,02,24
147,Outstanding Stay at One Aldwych,"We recently enjoyed a lovely stay at the newly refirbished One Aldwych.  You know it will be a special experience when you are greeted by smiling staff at the front desk and told your request for an early check-in has been approved.  We enjoyed a corner suite which was remarkably quiet given the location in central London.  We truly loved having a drink in the quiet lounge and the breakfast was impressive.  We travel frequently and what really stood out to us was the excellent staff.  From the doormen to the waiters in the restaurant to the front desk personnel, each encounter was friendly, pleasant and competent.  There is a great deal to make for an outstanding experience at the One Aldwych, but the people who work to make it all happen really stand out and made our stay most enjoyable.  We shall return as soon as possible!",5,2020,02,24
147,Pampered and happy,"Stayed with my brother and his family and have to say that the upgrade to the decor has certainly improved the look and the feel of One Aldwych. The bar also has a good vibe and great cocktails- went to Eneko restaurant for dinner and although busy, we had great food and service. Definitely would recommend and will be back.",5,2020,02,24
147,Overnight stay,"We had the most wonderful stay at The One Aldwych. From arrival the staff were delightful and went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. We were upgraded form a Classic to a Superior room which was really very nice. Beautifully decorated, spotless and very comfortable.",5,2020,02,23
147,Can't imagine staying anywhere else!,"My first impression of the hotel was set when I called to make my reservation and spoke with Elena. So nice, so professional and I was left excited for the trip after speaking with her. 

The hotel is not a chain and it shows in the attention to detail at every turn. Gorgeous, great location, wonderful food, and clean, clean, clean. The staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Augustino, Leroy, Diana, Ben and everyone whose names I've missed thank you for a wonderful visit. It will be very difficult for my husband to travel to London on business without my daughter and me again!",5,2020,02,23

147,Hotel with great location and service,"Stayed at the hotel for one night - we arrived at 10:45 hoping to get into our room, the front desk attendant made the effort to get us in out room by 11:15 - we hung out in the comfortable lounge until our room was ready - the location is great - able to walk to a lot of sites.  Drinks at the bar was also fun. Rooms were comfortable not huge.",5,2020,02,20
147,Awesome stay,"Such a lovely and luxury stay into the newly renovated One Aldwych hotel. Our junior suite was fully equipped and perfectly quiet .
Warm hospitality and great location.  This stay was the second time for us.  We won’t miss to come back for a 3rd time !",5,2020,02,17
147,Fabulous,"Dear ONEALDYCH team, we would like to thank you for the fantastic stay in your house. The service was always excellent and not pushy - great keep it up!

147,Fab weekend stay!,Recently stayed with my husband and had the best welcome/treatment / experience of any London hotel or any hotel for that matter in a long time! The hotel has a very understated elegance that oozes through every part of the especially the staff - the perfect balance of welcome and respect without being over the top nothing was too much trouble and what a great product and location ! inner at Eneko on site was exquisite and mouth watering and a real experience ! I really left feeling rested looked after and appreciated - the staff are a credit to you on reception restaurants concierge spa will definitely be staying again!,5,2020,02,04
147,Great location. Amazing Staff,We stayed on my wife's birthday and everything form the arrival until our departure was special.  The smartly dressed Porters knew my name on arrival and looked after the baggage and the car. The arrival was easy and our room was pristine.  There was a lovely amenity from the General Manager and a birthday card.  The bars and restaurants are first class - and the health spa is a treat with the basement swimming pool,5,2020,02,03
147,"Afternoon tea, wow!","We went for the Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea here, and wow it was amazing. The effort and detail put in was excellent. It really was worth every penny. They provided every item gluten free and all the desserts were gluten free. I was shocked at how accommodating they were, probably the best I have ever been catered for. You can choose lots of different teas to go with your food and it all tastes delicious. 100% would return for this, what an experience! Would recommend to anyone going to London. ",5,2020,01,28
147,Absolutely stunning!,"Everything about this hotel is just perfect! the rooms are super clean and well maintained, great gym and health facilities we stayed here with our eight and half month old daughter and also dined In one of the restaurants Eneko which was delicious we were super impressed by the family friendly atmosphere and also by the level of detail of the item’s placed in the room for our daughter would definitely recommend*****",5,2020,01,28
147,Excellence customer service after a poor experience in Eneko,I did not have a good dining experience in Eneko prior to Xmas and the manager picked up on my Tripadvisor review. As a consequence they offered my wife and I a complimentary drink in the bar of One Aldwych. The staff were very attentive and professional and the whole experience was very enjoyable. Thank you Mr Tucker for your excellent customer service.,4,2020,01,27
147,Great decor - nice staff,"Stayed one again in January to visit my family in London and was again well looked after. We used to stay and explore a few other hotels but found our gem near Covent Garden. The staff is welcoming and accommodating, comfortable beds and crisp/ clean sheets.",5,2020,01,21
147,Aldwych review,"Really nice hotel but not worth the money paid. Our room was lovely but it took 15 minutes for hot water to heat up. Complained twice and was told problem resolved but it wasnt. On leaving receptionist said sorry but they had fixed problem, in a hotel that charges £5 for service in the bar I would expect compensation as a nice hot shower in the morning is a must. Bar prices are expected in London but service charge is over the top. Won’t stay again.",3,2020,01,21
147,Outstanding. ,"Having stayed previously at one aldwych, my expectations were high. My previous visit was outstanding and this recent trip exceeded my expectations again. 

The rooms are immaculate, comfortable, well equipped, so beautifully decorated.

The gym had the latest equipment including a Peloton bike. (Amazing!) it was also immaculately clean. 

Food is well presented, vast choice for a vegetarian, as I am. Breakfast was a treat for the eyes and my stomach! 

The decor, from the bar to the restaurant and the attention to detail, so beautifully done. The florist for the hotel creates the most exquisite displays. 

The staff are truly wonderful. 

One aldwych has everything on point, service, amenities, location, the team. 

One Aldwych you are my favourite hotel in London!

",5,2020,01,21
147,Impeccable hotel ,"Its my first time to stay at covent garden . The house keeping is amazing . The bar is stunning . The state of art  gym and beautiful swimming pool. I had issue with with the check but was made up by upgrading my stay to an amazing suite 

",5,2020,01,20
147,Wonderful experience,"Totally amazing, stayed for 2 nights but wish it had been longer, the staff made you feel really special, the service from every area was perfect. Really loved the breakfast every thing was freshly cooked to order, will definitely be back. Thank you for a great weekend.",5,2020,01,14
147,Phenomenal customer service,"This was my first stay at One Aldwych and I can definitely say that I will be back. While the hotel rooms are not the largest that I have experienced in London, the friendly professionalism and helpfulness of the staff are head and shoulders above anything I've experienced in London. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff, everyone knew who we were and called us by our names throughout our stay; we were made to feel like old friends. 

The hotel room itself was spotless and well stocked with beautiful toiletries and helpful items like a Dyson hairdryer, umbrella, travel bag for toiletries. 

We used room service for breakfast and this was prompt and beautifully presented; it tasted pretty good too!",5,2020,01,14
147,Favorite Hotel in London,"As always, stellar customer service and wonderful accommodations. One Aldwych will always be my go to hotel for London visits.  A leader in the fine details customizing to the hotel guests preferences. ",5,2020,01,12
147,One of a kind - One Aldwych,"From entering this magnificent hotel, the kindness of all the people the feeling they truly give for what you want/wish/ask for, everything is just splendid.
Location is great, food, well let's call it a fireworks of taste, truly one of the leafing hotels if the world ",5,2020,01,12
147,Keep going back,"Nothing is too much for the staff here. It might seem expensive, but the service is worth every penny - by comparison to other similar hotels. The hotel has had a recent facelift which you might or might not like (the rooms seem lighter) and the Dyson hairdriers are a new luxury.",5,2020,01,12
147,Fantastic,"Just spent two nights at One Aldwych and it is one of finest hotels we have stayed at. Everything was simply perfect. The room, the staff, the food, the service, the attention to to detail. 

We will be back ",5,2020,01,12
147,"Superb hotel and staff, convenient location","This was a great hotel, recently renovated, helpful staff, lovely eating and bar on site. I'd come back in a heartbeat. From the booking to the checkout, staff were absolutely lovely.  Location in Covent Garden is ideal, lively, close to entertainment, restaurants and transit.  ",5,2020,01,11
147,Great Location,"Good sized rooms, great locations for restaurants and bars, right in Covent Garden.
Very good breakfast, large indoor swimming pool and nice staff. Plenty to do in the area, definitely a great hotel within a mid range price level. Had an extra bed a a crib in the room. Stayed July 2018.",4,2020,01,11
147,Superb from start to finish!,"My partner and I visited indigo at the end of September 2018 for my birthday, whilst there we enjoyed a drink in the lobby and were so taken aback at how friendly the staff were and how nice the hotel seemed that we decided then and there to stay for his birthday in January.

We noticed that there was a deal on their website called ‘festive sparkle’ this included for the price of £400 a superior room, Festive Spirit of Adventure cocktail for two, Full English breakfast for two, Complimentary unlimited high-speed WiFi throughout the hotel, Complimentary use of the Health Club - including the 18-metre chlorine-free swimming pool & 24-hour gym access, Fresh flowers delivered daily
M, Access to Lounge at One, the hotels private guest lounge and Access to unlimited online magazines and newspapers through PressReader.

When we checked in we were told we were given an upgrade and were shown by the member of staff checking us into the room to the lift and up to the room itself. We were of course excited to have received an upgrade but looking online since I think room 306 was the originally booked superior room and not a deluxe, but either way... the room itself is lovely. It’s beautifully decorated, we had a nice view of the shard and oxo tower, the bathroom is beautifully appointed and everything was well maintained and clean.

We were given two vouchers for a free glass of champagne rather than a voucher for something from the cocktail menu which confused us slightly, but we still enjoyed the free champagne, but we did have our hearts set on the Japanese cocktail on the menu which we’d enjoyed on a previous visit to the lounge. Again however, the staff were fantastic in the lounge, you receive olives and nuts with your drink ( note to coeliac / gluten free guests I was informed the olives are gluten free but the nuts are not ) and the atmosphere in the bar is very nice.

We also made use of the gym and pool facilities and we were surprised how quiet they both were. No one provided us with a towel when we arrived so we had to go in search for one but otherwise we very much enjoyed this area and you should make use of the facilities if you stay.

Lastly breakfast was superb. All staff here are amazing and there’s one female member of staff who remembered us from our previous visit in September! Including where we sat and that it was my birthday meal, amazing memory! We loved breakfast it was all absolutely delicious and if you’re gluten free there’s a whole separate menu option which comes with the best muffin I’ve ever had period, let alone a gluten free option.

All in all, staff are amazing here, nothing is too much. The room was spacious, well decorated and appointed and in a great location, the bar is a fantastic place to relax and unwind, the gym and pool is lovely and the food is delicious. We cannot wait to return, this is likely now our go to hotel for trips to London! Thank you!",5,2020,01,05
147,"Very nice hotel, good location.",Perfect hotel for visiting central London. All the werking people are so Nice and friendly for helping you. We like it a lot and come next time back to this beautifull hotel . With you birthday you fully surprised with presents in your room! ,5,2020,01,04
147,Welcome accident ,"We were staying in London for NYE at another hotel but on our walk down to the river we all needed a little rest.
There were 4 adults and 1child. 
We enquired with the concierge if we would be able to pop in for a drink.
His reply was but of course you are welcome. 
We were welcomed by the friendly bar staff who were attentive and very courteous. 
We ended up staying there a lot longer than we expected because it was a lovely atmosphere and you could have a conversation without shouting. 

Not sure if I could afford to stay there but we will for sure return for drinks ",5,2020,01,01
147,Great place to stay; exceptional service,"This is the second time we've stayed at One Aldwych. It has been fantastic both times. Great service, friendly staff and convenient location. Will stay here again. The renovation is very good and the breakfast service which we used each day was excellent. Thank you.",5,2019,12,29
147,What a treat!,"We kept One Aldwych for the end of our long vacation and it was the highlight of our trip. The hotel has just been refurbished (we stayed there many years ago) and although when it comes to the staff nothing much as changed (bare with me with this one), the hotel looks and feels completely new. The rooms are tastefully decorated with really calm colours which is a contrast from the bustling and rather busy location that it sits in. The room is a peaceful place to unwind and relax after a busy afternoon of shopping in Covent Garden or a night of theatre and dining.
Speaking about dining… Indigo, one of the two restaurants of One Aldwych is the perfect place for dinner, lovely food at reasonable prices. The Lobby bar serves wonderful cocktails and I must say, still the best hot chocolate in the UK!
The breakfast is also a real treat, the food is delicious and it is served in a very relaxed atmosphere. 
I should mention that another big improvement was the bathroom, ours was simply fabulous. It had a very luxurious feel with an amazing shower, beautifully sourced amenities and loads of space!
About the staff… they remain the most professional, welcoming and warm team that we have encountered across all ours years of traveling. They always make you feel like you are home. Like many years ago, we were very sad to leave…
",5,2019,12,26
147,Beautifully Refurbished,This was my first stay after the refurbishment. The hotel is tranquil as before and looks beautiful after its recent refurbishment. The designers have taken the guest's comfort and have anticipated every need conceivable. It's still my favourite hotel.,5,2019,12,26
147,The best hotel in London just got better,"It’s been about a year since we visited because of their refurbishment. The accessible rooms were finished quite recently. But boy was it worth the wait. I travel with my brother who is wheelchair bound so accessibility is key for us. From the second we arrived there were improvements. The ramp at the main entrance is much less steep and there is an automatic door which is great. The room door is wider, there is more space in the room, the bath has gone & in its place is a wheel in shower with a shower chair. The sinks in the bathroom are lower. In summary they have thought of everything. Apart from the logistics the refurb is wonderful. The hotel now is modern, fresh and calming, the cocktail menu is a delight and Indigo is lovely. The staff were as always wonderfully welcoming and attentive, and this trip really felt like we were “home “. Thank you so much One Aldwych for doing what you do so well. You should be very proud of all of your staff.",5,2019,12,23
147,Excellent- a lesson is fabulous service and great taste,"We had a one night stay in one of the deluxe rooms- the room was beautifully decorated with every possible luxury. Supremely comfy bed, very quiet at night despite being on the Strand. 
Wonderful, attentive service that makes you feel valued. The cocktails in the bar are delicious, and it has a lively atmosphere on a Friday night.",5,2019,12,21
147,Amazing afternoon tea,"My family and I booked the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea at One Aldwych. I was a little skeptical when booking because there is the distinct possibility of disappointment. However, all the family were delighted from start to finish. Yes, it wasn’t cheap but it was a lovely experience that created wonderful memories. The food was spectacular and the service was second to none. Overall, a wonderful afternoon that we will never forget.",5,2019,12,19
147,Elegant and Great Location,"One Aldwych has always been a favorite and, after completing its recent renovations, is even better. Rooms are nicely decorated/maintained and very roomy by London standards. Staff is excellent and extremely responsive to guest needs.You cannot go wrong staying here.",5,2019,12,17
147,Disappointing,"This used to be our favourite London hotel. Not sure if it’s changed hands, but it’s the not the same as it was. Our room was pokey and the new decor is awful. Used to be modern, dark and understated, now pastels and light wood, really dreadful. I thought the room was really expensive for the size and you can no longer have breakfast in your room - a 5 star hotel with no breakfast in your room...? 

Upsides:  The beds were comfortable and the Staff were all helpful and friendly.

Won’t be returning sadly.",3,2019,12,17
147,Great hospitality & ambience,"I always love visiting the one Aldwych as I always feel that it is a home from home, with the comfortable décor, bright easy lighting and not to mention the great food choices and the friendly hospitality of the staff.",5,2019,12,10
147,Better than ever,"This is my fourth stay at One Aldwych but first since the renovations.  Rooms are bright and larger.  We didn't use the gym or pool facilities but hear they are beautiful  The bar is still lively and wonderful.  The staff is so helpful   Can't beat the location  
Advice - get breakfast included",5,2019,12,08
147,Weekend short stay,"We found the accommodation very comfortable, the staff very courteous and helpful. We had a very relaxed stay and found the atmospher very calming and relaxed and not at all pompous. All in all we would not hesitate to come back for hopefully a longer stay. Thank-you.",5,2019,12,05
147,Beautiful hotel quality in every respect inc location,"Welcomed to the hotel, service was excellent, beautiful room and perfect location for Covent Garden and theatres, would have liked a bath but I hadn't specified, bar an cocktails was superb I really couldn't fault the hotel or staff",5,2019,12,03
147,"Super fresh, modern option in Covent Garden","One Aldwych is a super comfortable, small, modern hotel great for the theatre scene or business. My Classic Suite was relaxing with it's modern furniture and comfortable bed, tvs -- more apartment like than anything. I didn't want to leave. bathroom was large in size and closet as well. Living area was perfect even though small. Service from the staff - down to the gym custodian was very cheerful, helpful in every way. Breakfast being a la carte was perfect - no buffet which I loved. I found a new affection for Covent Garden because of One Aldwych. Concierge staff is top notch.",5,2019,12,02
147,The very best home when away from home,"If only I knew this hotel is this good much earlier. With roughly 150 five star hotels to choose from, it was usually company policy, location or a membership program making the selection easier. However, the One Aldwych has been on my wish list for years. With the Lion King Theater just steps away this time it was the perfect choice. Over the last 20 years I have spent more nights in hotels than anyone would wish for so yes I consider myself to be quite particular and perhaps even spoilt. 
Smiling still when I write this, after years of ""averageness"" or ""it was ok"", the One Aldwych exceeded truly all my expectations and even my ""must have minimum this & that""-list.  This hotel is a warm blanket of hospitality,  and attention for each guest. From the doorman whose body language was all ""welcome to our hotel"" and after just hearing my name one time introduced us with our last name to his colleague at the reception desk. Then we were told the hotel had been closed for 6 months for renovations during which the staff were invited to make suggestions. The owners of this hotel truly focus on quality, customer & staff satisfaction before shareholder value, which in the long term will automatically take care of their investment in my opinion. 
Every staff member from maid to manager had that same sense of ownership and spoke of ""our hotel"". The two rooms we booked for 2 adults and 2 children were connecting rooms even without me asking for it, grown weary of the numbers of ""sorry impossible|"" I have heard over the years. The rooms exceeded all expectations such as a generous minibar with high end wines and spirits, the materials used etc etc. I prefer not to mention the rooms we were given in too much detail, for the simple selfish reason that this hotel now is my preferred hotel in London and I rather not cause my favourite room to be unavailable a next time! But I can share that this hotel is EXCELLENT!! ",5,2019,12,01
147,Excellent stay,"We had a wonderful stay at OneAldwych on our London weekend before Christmas. It stood up to all my expectations, a lovely nice decorated room with a fantastic bathroom ( big shower). The staff and the service was superb. And the Christmas decoration in the lobby-bar was the most beautiful I have ever seen. We would very mutch like to come back soon.",5,2019,11,30
147,Sensational room and swimming pool,"Great hotel perfectly centrally located, near the Thames. Rooms with top amenities - all lights can be dimmed. Beautiful bed. Top TV set. The spa looks great - with fantastic and large gym room + great swimming pool one level below + sauna/steamroom. Make sure you have time to enjoy it even early or late at night. ",5,2019,11,30
147,Fabulous weekend ,"We picked the hotel for it’s location in the west end. The staff were, without exception, helpful and friendly. The service was first class and nothing was too much trouble. The swimming pool and spa area is very nice. Afternoon tea was a memorable experience with a fantastic selection of foods. If you have any specific food requirements, they will go the extra mile to accommodate you. A really lovely weekend, would recommend the Hotel completely ",5,2019,11,27
147,"Film, Fizz and Dinner plus overnight stay",Staff were amazing and extremely attentive. Food was incredible and great to have such a varied gluten free option. Refurbished room was wonderful and had all the necessary amenities. Highly recommend a stay here.,5,2019,11,26
147,Amazing hotel in every way,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great, central London location. The staff couldn't be nicer and the amenities are wonderful The hotel has recently been renovated, and the rooms are even more luxurious than before. The beds and linens are top quality. New touches include coffee and tea makers in the rooms as well as in the new tasteful guest lounge. The gym and pool facilities are first rate, and unusually large for a city hotel.We have been fortunate to have stayed at One Aldwych on several trips to London, and it remains the very best.",5,2019,11,18
147,"Fantastic hotel, starting with reception","I arrived after an overnight flight with a little problem on my booking. But the receptionist  (blonde and tall, I think she's called Gekka or Jekka) was just incredible. She was efficient and friendly and managed to sort it all out. I am so impressed with her. The great thing of the hotel is this kind of service, efficiency and friendliness is not uncommon. Everything just works right. The rooms are perfect and spacious with the right touches everywhere. Won't stay anywhere else in London from now on!",5,2019,11,15
147,Fantastic hotel and renovations,"Spent 3 nights at One Aldwych in November. The rooms have recently been redone, and they were sensational. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the amenities as always are second to none, especially considering the Central London location! Highly recommend.",5,2019,11,14
147,beautiful reno,We recently enjoyed our 22nd visit to One Aldwych. You cannot beat the location . The hotel has undergone extensive renovations making the rooms some of the freshest and coziest anywhere. What hasn't changed is the attention to detail throughout .We would highly recommend staying here,5,2019,11,10
147,Top notch!,"Recently spent 8 nights at One Aldwych. Fabulous experience at this this top notch and well-located hotel. Attentive, friendly, helpful, and efficient staff, a great lobby bar, innovative restaurants and a luxurious room made our stay a five star experience. Highly recommend.",5,2019,11,08
147,Half term holiday,"We have just spent 3 days at Number 1. We had a marvelous time. The rooms were spectacular as was Indigo and the pool sublime.
The staff were extremely kind and accommodating to all of our needs.. another brilliant trip number 1.",5,2019,11,08
147,Best Hotel Ever,Stayed in London for an event so booked the newly refurbished hotel for 2 nights and was so glad I did.  The staff were fantastic and a nice welcome gift from Janine the General Manger made the stay extra special.  The service in the bar and restaurant could not be faulted and the cocktail list is amazing.  I will be coming back as a regular to London this place will be my new home.,5,2019,11,08
147,London City Break,"We loved the hotel and slept incredibly well. From entering, the service was warm and welcoming and continued right through the stay. Our room was perfect. Serene, elegant and calming - cocooned in a gently curved suite among the London rooftops. I felt completely at home and enjoyed the fact we could open the window. Amenities were considerate but not over done. The Dyson hairdryer, high-quality coffee and tea amenities, and Mitchel and Peach bathroom products were thoughtful touches. The location is excellent and the swimming pool (chlorine free) and spa made it feel like a real city break. Breakfast was also fantastic (gluten and dairy free!) I forgot my phone charger and had one delivered within 5 minutes. Well done One Aldwych - a perfect city hotel in the heart of Covent Garden, one of London's most romantic areas.",5,2019,11,08
147,Wow!,"This hotel is a real gem.  It exceeded our expectations from the moment we entered reception. Beautifully appointed bedrooms with every comfort (low level night lights were a thoughtful touch) and the bar area was stunning.  Live entertainment was great too.  The swimming pool & spa which is tucked away in the basement, had real wow factor & the gorgeous pool made exercise easy for once! Breakfast was excellent from a varied & extensive menu.  The staff could not have been more helpful or engaging.
We hope to return!",5,2019,11,08
147,Incredible Nights Stay!,"I was fortunate enough to stay a night One Aldwych. I have stayed here in the past but once again this place exceeded my expectations!

Walking into my room was pure delight. It is clear to see that after undergoing renovations every detail has been taken into consideration. From the cosy blankets that are provided during the turn down service to the incredibly large bathtub fitted with a LCD TV-you in for a night of total bliss! My suite was impeccably clean and well laid out with both a bedroom and lounge. 

One Aldwych has got to be one of my favourite places to stay. Being in the centre of London it really does give you a lovely home away from home feel. I would highly recommend the hotel not only to those looking for a luxury stay but also those who are looking for a place for casual drinks or even a quality place to dine. -Eneko Restaurant is outstanding.

I can't thank the staff enough for making my stay so special- I will be back!",5,2019,11,07
147,Attention to detail and beyond at One Aldwych,"My girlfriend and I have had a fantastic few nights at the hotel. The hotel and its bedrooms are stunning. The hotel staff are efficient and always friendly and the food is amazing. 
My girlfriend is a coeliac and the hotel's gluten free offering is fantastic. Better yet, the hotel's Indigo restaurant is fully gluten and dairy free!",5,2019,11,07
147,Better than ever,This was the first time we had stayed at One Aldwych for over a year and it was great to return. Staying here always had a sense of occasion quite different to other central London hotels and since the refurb things have got even better. Our room was beautifully designed and although it was just for one night we found it supremely comfortable. Every member of staff encountered did everything they could to make us feel welcome and nothing seemed too much trouble. A minor quibble is that we initially struggled to get the room temperature just as we wanted but after a quick demo we soon found the perfect setting. Evening cocktails in the Lobby Bar were served with panache and although we ate out for dinner the quality of breakfast rounded off a fabulous stay. The location is great and hopefully we’ll find a good reason to return again very soon….! ,5,2019,11,07
147,Fantastic service,"I recently celebrated a special birthday at the One Aldwych and cannot fault the whole experience. The service from the staff was fantastic and once they knew it was a special occasion they went overboard to make it extra special.
I also had dinner at the hotel which was excellent - especially the waiters knowledge of the menu/dishes and accompanying wine.
I will definitely be going back - asap !!",5,2019,11,07
147,"Fantastic hotel, attentive staff and an amazing location!","I was fortunate to stay at One Aldwych as a Birthday treat.

The overall impression of the hotel was very impressive. Having recently undergone a renovation, it is clear to see that no consideration has been forgotton. You are greeted by a warm welcome before being taken to your room. We stayed in the corner suite; with it's spacious and comfortable living area, soft bed and large bathroom with luxurious products we were very sorry to leave the next day!

It was very easy to explore London from the hotel and within a few minutes walk we were in the heart of Convent Garden. The evening was finished off by enjoying a few cocktails in the impressive Lobby Bar- you must try the Osaka Blossom!

We ran out of time in the evening to eat at Indigo but thoroughly enjoyed breakfast the following morning.

We look forward to returning for our next city break!",5,2019,11,06
147,Afternoon tea delight,"I took my two daughters (6 and 8) for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea and it was an absolute delight! 

Not just the incredible food, but the service and kindness shown to my very excited little girls. This was an absolute highlight of their day in London and I can’t recommend the experience more highly.

Many thanks to the wonderful team, as well as the kitchen staff making the delicious treats! X",5,2019,11,04
147,48 hour happiness ,"I visited One Aldwych for a weekend of alone time in London! The staff at this hotel is something for them self! Extremely professional, but at the same time personal and warm! You don’t see that in many hotels! I got upgraded to a suite, happy days! The room was perfect. Slept like a child in the bed, and the bathroom is really like a spa! Will come back for sure!! ",5,2019,11,03
147,Amazing Location and Ambience,"One of my favorite hotels in London. The hotel was recently renovated and the decor is beautifully done. Sophisticated and understated, but comfortable.  The lobby has a double height space, with large windows to the streets.  The service is excellent.  Once there, I walked to everything, museums, theater, restaurants.  The pool downstairs for a morning swim is an extra bonus.",5,2019,10,30
147,Birthday treat,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay immensely. This is our second visit. Rooms are great and very quiet and very comfortable, food and facilities also great. We were really well looked after by the staff throughout our stay. ",5,2019,10,29
147,"Amazing location, staff and hotel!","We recently spent a week in One Aldwych in a suite. The room was impeccably clean, spacious, well lit, lots of storage, bathroom shower and tub, large vanity. Honestly the room was amazing. The hotel staff are all very polite, helpful and knowledgeable. Eneko restaurant has superb Basque food, the lobby bar has delicious interesting cocktails in a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere and Indigo has a good variety of breakfast foods served by a polite and efficient staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who seeks the perfect location and the highest level hotel.",5,2019,10,27
147,Great location and wonderful staff,Stayed last prior the refurbishment and I’m positively surprised by the friendly and chique redo. Been a fan before and now even more! The staff was welcoming and provided us with everything I needed to have a seamless stay. Will be back!,5,2019,10,25
147,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Staff and Superior Location.","Pampered and well fed, if you stay at One Aldwych, you will be truly pleased with every aspect of your stay.   The staff is welcoming, accommodating as well informative on places to eat and how to easily find your way around London.   No question is to small and no request seems to be without immediate attention.   The rooms are simply wonderful, the decor is modern and the amenities are first rate.   Beds are very comfortable and the pillow plentiful.   Yet, it is the Gluten-free dining that is what makes a stay here so enticing for those of us who have to eat Gluten-free.   The Chef has done a menu that is so varied and tasty, that it appeals to everyone and the deserts are the proverbial icing on the culinary cake.   You have to try the Bar and partake of their varied offerings of different and tasty cocktails and be pampered by the waiters who know every drink by heart.  The wait staff is to be commended for their attention to the needs of their customers and they make timely and very delicious recommendations for your dining pleasure.    Still, it is the location that makes this place so ideal, being within walking distance of many Underground stations, as well as bus stops, you can get anywhere within the city from here.  Additionally, it is centered right between all the major rail stations, so a trip to the countryside or even the continent is do able.   We loved our stay at One Aldwych and hope to return soon to our hotel of choice in London.",5,2019,10,21
147,Spectacular,"My husband and I stayed at One Aldwych during our European honeymoon and we could not be happier with our time there. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. All staff were incredibly friendly and professional. When we checked in early in the morning, Dov notified us our room was ready and we had been upgraded! Our room was simply spectacular. It was spacious and wow, the style was beyond expectations. The bed was very comfortable and the shower in the bathroom was wonderful. We popped out for some sightseeing and upon return, some treats including a bottle of champagne and cake slice was awaiting with a written note from Dov. Thank you!

The location of the hotel is great. Close to the tube and lots of restaurants, sites, bars, shopping etc.

The only regret we had during our stay was that it was not longer.

Thank you for making our stay enjoyable and especially to Dov! We can't wait to come back when we are in London next",5,2019,10,20
147,Great Hotel in a good location.,"We really enjoyed our stay at One Aldwych.  Our room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable and we loved the Tapas Bar but one thing made it extra special, the staff who were unfailingly, helpful, courteous and, most importantly, friendly! Treasure them! They made us feel right at home. A big thank you to the guys on the door and our lovely chambermaid. ",5,2019,10,14
147,Special Birthday ,Had a fabulous stay at this hotel back in August for a friends 30th. A huge special thank you to Rui and Dov for going above and beyond to make sure the decorations were perfectly put up in the room and that everything ran super smoothly! Would recommend this hotel for a special occasion. ,5,2019,10,14
147,Return visit after refurbishment,"Let time we visited really like this place but felt the rooms were a bit too small. They recently went through a major upgrade even though they were already very new so we visited again. Booked into a superior room.

Room size was very good, high quality feel to furnishings and decor. Lots of power points and USB slots available, dyson hairdryer with mirror and power socket in a convenient place. Lighting reasonable.  Shower great and good size bath in the room. Three free bottles of water in the room, great pillows and a well stocked mini bar. 

Didn't visit this time but they do have a fantastic swimming pool. 

Not so positive was noise from doors banging in other rooms plus noise fro toilets flushing elsewhere. They have a water saving system which makes flushing and  running the shower a bit noisier than normal. Drinks in the bar a bit expensive especially aperol spritz at £17 which is grossly inflated. Not a big fan of the curtain in the bathroom that you can clearly see out of and assume that apartments across the road may be able to see in through. 

Would certainly visit again.",4,2019,10,13
147,Beautiful Rooms,"I stayed here for one night while over in London on the Business trip, but I wish I was staying longer and I will definitely come back.

The room was on the 5th floor with beautiful views of London. The rooms are not huge vast spaces, but are impeccably and elegantly designed with a very stylish and relaxing decor that make the rooms homely and cozy with a smart utilization of space. little details like the books on the shelves and the fresh flowers in the room also help to create that wonderful homely atmosphere. If this was my bedroom in my home I would be very please to get the balance so right.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I was leaving very early the next morning and the staff endeavored to have my breakfast up to my room much earlier than the normal breakfast hours. The breakfast was very tasty. I will be back, but will spend more time exploring the hotel next time!",5,2019,10,06
147,The epitome of romantic,"Second visit to this amazing hotel in central London and once again, exceeded expectations. All I can say is that if this location, this ambiance, this level of service and decor fails to ignite a romantic passion with your loved one, then you are dead!
Well worth the money. Staff are exceptional, food is excellent and rooms are simply divine.",5,2019,10,05
147,"Ideal Location, comfortable hotel, fabulous staff.","My husband, Adult Daughter and I stayed for two nights in a huge suite to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel has had a recent facelift and is looking fantastic. It is independently owned so it can make it's own style, which is comfortable and welcoming.
The rooms are elegant and the air  conditioning very efficient. There are lovely  details everywhere and wonderful views across London. 
All the staff are friendly and always speak to you, even the behind the scenes people.
There are two restaurants. We ate in Indigo, which is very well laid out and serves lovely food. It also offers gluten and lactose free foods without any loss of quality.
We look forward to returning again soon.",5,2019,09,29
147,Better than ever,"As our favourite hotel in London we had to make a quick trip to see the results of the recent refurbishment. As we approached the door my wife said to me "" Now you know i am fussy, they might have ruined it."" She need not have worried - it is better than ever. 
What strikes you is the evident pride the staff have in their newly refurbished hotel. They are all keen to show you around and point out the new features.
The beds remain outstandingly comfortable, a good nights sleep is guaranteed. The rooms have everything you need and the windows open - I like fresh air!  
The only thing that is not as good as previously are the sofas in the lobby bar, they are just not a comfortable to settle into. It's just a small point in an otherwise faultless experience.We cannot wait to be back.",5,2019,09,22
147,Fantastic Hotel and staff,"We had a fantastic stay at One Aldwych recently. We used it as a base to see a couple of shows in the area. The hotel was fantastic and the staff were amazing. All the staff had been on extensive training whilst the hotel was being refurbished and you could tell. They were extremely polite, efficient and helpful. Overall they presented an extremely professional image and the hotel should be very proud of its staff. ",5,2019,09,20
147,Wonderful!,"All our expectations were met with professionalism,courtesy and,helpfulness!
We ere very comfortable and the hotel is just beautiful! We loved all the fresh flowers!
We already recommended One Aldwich to our travel agent and would definitely stay again!",5,2019,09,19
147,Lost Opportunity,"We enjoyed our stay at One Aldwych. The staff went out of their way to make us welcome and the accommodation and food were very good. A few negatives included rather ""loud mouthed"" business meetings going off in the residents lounge, busy drop off point for tour buses outside the front entrance and the availability of the spa to non residents making it crowded at peak times. Our main issue however was the vastly increased price when we came to book again at current rates - the hotel is possibly the most expensive in London. Whilst the service was good we did not feel that it was that good. Also we were very sorry that the personal relationship that the staff worked so hard to develop was not translated into any form of personal loyalty to regular customers by the management. An opportunity lost as we are regular visitors and would have come back again and again.",2,2019,09,18
147,A WONDERFUL PLACE TO STAY!,"We have stayed at the Aldwych several times before but this was our first stay since the re-vamp,
and it was better than ever! The rooms are now really beautiful, and our upgrade to a suite was 
a wonderful surprise. Th staff are as attentive as ever, and really make it a welcoming home from home. We cannot recommend this hotel enough, a big thank you to you all, and can't wait to come and stay again!!",5,2019,09,18
147,Wonderful Stay,"We recently had a perfect stay at the One Aldwych hotel for 4 nights. After a bit of a journey to get to the hotel we had a pleasant and quick check in and our room was upgraded at arrival. The room was beautiful and the bed very comfortable. We found the housekeeping service to be outstanding and all needs anticipated. We had breakfast at the hotel resturant and food and service were great! Drinks at the bar are a must, the cocktail menu is extensive and the bartenders are great at guiding you through the menu and helping you select the perfect drink. The front desk and bellhop staff were truly one of the best I have encountered. Everyone was very friendly and happy to answer any questions. Will be back and will recommend to friends traveling to London. ",5,2019,09,18
147,Poor customer service,"I reserved your 5th floor suite and an adjoining room for 4 nights (but the last night was seven days after the first three nights).  I tried to cancel the larger room for the last night for a period of 36 hours (first with AmEx, with whom I booked the room, and then the hotel itself), but somehow missed the 24 hour cancellation window.  Not a huge deal but poor service in my view.",2,2019,09,18
147,Refurbishment largely a great success,"The rooms have been very well upgraded, our major concern is that we understand quite a number of rooms now only have a shower, availability of a room with bath would be essential for future reservations. The public areas are greatly improved with a good flow through the entrance/ reception/ bar. We were particularly pleased to see a lot of familiar faces amongst the staff so the levels of friendly service remain high.",5,2019,09,18
147,Back with a vengeance!,"One Aldwych is back and better than ever. The staff, rooms, lobby bar, Indigo, health club and treatments all excelled on our recent stay in the summer. We've since booked an autumn stay and are planning a stay between Christmas and New Year's.",5,2019,09,18
147,Family weekend break,"One A has been my hotel of choice in London when staying in business for a number of years as the service and location is outstanding. We visit as a family a couple of times a year, often to see West End show. My wife and teenage children were excited to visit to check out the refurbishment that I had said breathed new life into OneA. They were not disappointed! The welcome was as warm as ever from the doormen to reception it felt like being welcomed back by family, with Maria making w special effort to ensure we had adjoining rooms and some delicious biscuits and fruit to enjoy.   The rooms now have a “Hamptons chiq” fresh feeling with great showers and beds as comfy as they have always been.  
The lobby bar area and addition of a new puppy to join Beano (a “statue” not a real one to the disappointment of our daughter) maintained a quirky touch to a stylish new lobby bar. A fabulous stay in a home from home. ",5,2019,09,18
147,Wonderful hotel,"We were welcomed to the hotel by one of the managers, Dov, who showed us to our upgraded suite, which was wonderful and spacious.  The bathroom was large and modern, with everything that we could require, including a Dyson hairdryer.  The bed was large and comfortable, which plenty of cool lighting.  The separate living area was nice, although just a little soulless, but a great place to relax.
We had a wonderful meal in the downstairs restaurant before going to a show.  It was just filling up shortly before we had to leave, but was getting a very good atmosphere.  
Breakfast in the room was sumptious, with avocado & eggs on toast....just right.
We did not have time to make use of the pool, but this is a very special hotel with very friendly staff.  We would definitely stay here again",5,2019,09,17
147,High class,"Newly refurbished classy hotel. Right on the edge of Covent Garden it is hard to fault this place. It’s not cheap, but that’s not what it’s trying to be. The hi-tech refurb left me a bit confused, so maybe a little more intuitive next time- but I’m picking hairs now! ",4,2019,09,15
147,Independent style and great service from engaged staff makes for a great stay.,"The hotel has been refurbished and I stayed prior to the makeover and again a few days ago.  I recall the care and professionalism of all the staff was a highlight of the previous stay. I'd say that somehow the makeover has revitalised the team and the customer service they offer; the obvious enthusiasm of the staff to engage and satisfy the expectations and wishes of the guests (I was in a group of 6) is a real pleasure.  This applied at all levels from the uniformed staff to the bar and restaurant as well as housekeeping.
New rooms are smart but smaller than i remember them, but less quirky in style than before the refurbishment. 
Food very good (I only had breakfast in house).
Bar comfortable, stylish with a relaxed atmosphere with caring and exceptional staff.
My group were treated as valued guests and we look forward to going back again in the future.
For those looking for a smart top class hotel with an independent style but without overt pretentiousness i'd recommend this hotel.",5,2019,09,14
147,Extremely tasty Vegan Afternoon Tea..,"the first time i have experienced a vegan afternoon tea, and i have been to afternoon tea at this hotel before, but the vegan version was far far tastier and i enjoyed this more.  Great thought into the food - and best lemon sherbert candy floss ever.... we asked for extra savories as these were so good :) YUM",5,2019,09,11
147,Love this place,We always stay at One Adwych every time we pass through London. The afternoon tea is amazing! The drinks in the bar always hit the spot before we head out on a night out in town. Must visit and most conveniently located.,5,2019,09,08
147,Birthday treat,"I visited this Hotel Saturday 24th August with my son to celebrate my birthday.  I have been previously before the refurbishment.

The lobby bar is spectacular. 
The staff were all very professional and friendly.
Goshia looked after us well and even brought a mini birthday cake & a small champagne.
All the waiters and waitresses were friendly not forgetting the doormen.
I would highly recommend this Hotel in the heart of London and perfect for pre drinks before a show.
Thank you all once again for making my evening special and hope to return very soon.",5,2019,08,28
147,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea,"We ( parents and teens) visited the beautiful One Aldwych hotel this afternoon to sample the Charlie and the Chocolate factory themed afternoon tea. This hotel really is an oasis in the middle of busy Covent Garden. the afternoon tea was fantastical and delicious, with incredible smoking cocktails (dry ice) for the adults and delicious savouries and incredible sweets including lemon sherbet candy floss. The staff were friendly and the service was excellent. Would highly recommend as a special treat, make sure you are hungry before you go as there are a lot of amazing things to eat. ",5,2019,08,26
147,Indigo Restaurant,"Spent a wonderful afternoon at this stunning recently refurbished restaurant. Being a coeliac I was spoilt for choice. Delightful gluten free menu, I could eat everything and it was most reassuring to have such attentive staff who were very knowledgable about allergies. Food was delicious and presentation of dishes was a joy to the eyes thanks to the expertise of Executive chef Dominic Teague. Laura, restaurant operations manager made our day extra special when she found out we were celebrating our Sons GCSE’s and brought them each a complimentary slice of chocolate cake. We look forward to a return visit.",5,2019,08,25
147,"Beautiful hotel, highly recommended","We stayed here for one night last week as a special treat as my husband and I were celebrating an important anniversary.  We couldn't have been better looked after.  We were upgraded to a classic suite which was a lovely surprise.  The suite was beautiful, tastefully decorated and clean as a new pin.
All the staff we encountered were pleasant, friendly and eager to make sure we were happy.
The hotel is newly refurbished and you can see every attention to detail.  Everywhere is sparkling and fresh.
I would highly recommend staying here, it's a wonderful hotel with fantastic staff.",5,2019,08,25
147,Wonderful rooms and great service.,"The room was unique and classic.  A highlight was the concierge desk. I found Alan, Claudia and Augostinho to be especially kind and helpful.  They made our stay in London all the better, both within the hotel and for our activities outside the hotel.  They treated us as friends and made us feel at home.",5,2019,08,24
147,Afternoon Tea,"We had the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon Tea as a birthday treat for my wife and everything was perfect. We were very impressed with how everything had it’s own unique and wonderful taste and even the teas were unusual but very tasty.

The staff were great and once they found out it was my wife’s birthday they brought a little cake out with a candle for her.

If you want an afternoon Tea with a twist then look no further!",5,2019,08,18
147,Afternoon Tea ,"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory Afternoon tea yummy 
Lovely service very attentive ! Loved the theme and food was great worth every penny 
You can add cocktails that looked cool and we’ tried 3 types of tea mint, mango and berry all really great loose leaf in a china cup ",5,2019,08,18
147,Excellent afternoon tea!,"Excellent afternoon tea - the experience was lovely from start to finish and it all felt a bit magical thanks to the wonderful Roald Dahl.

We had a couple of specific dietary requirements in our party, we advised restaurant at time of booking and everything was perfect for everyone - staff were attentive and informative, and very discreet about the dietary requirements so everyone felt equal.

I would highly recommend this afternoon tea, particularly with children.",5,2019,08,12
147,Afternoon tea Charlie and the chocolate factory ,"The only place in London to have afternoon tea with you’re children! The food was amazing so much care and attention gone into it, my husbands is a vegan and was completely spoilt for choice and best of all it kept coming! Staff couldn’t do enough for us not only engaging with the children but also helping us to make our tea choices and recommending things to do locally. If I could give you 10 stars I would, we will definitely be back and I’ll also be recommended you to anyone I know travelling to London...my favourite part of my trip. ",5,2019,08,09
147,"Beautiful, relaxing and welcoming Hotel in a fantastic location.","From the moment of entering the building, which belies the modern opulent interior, we were made very welcome, the staff were all very pleasant and attentive without being overbearing.
We stayed for one night, special treat for my partners birthday and enjoyed every minute of it. The restaurant  food was delicious and bar welcoming, but both a llittle expensive... but worth it and in all honesty expected.. 
We are both very much looking forward to our next stay. at One Aldwych, Such a pleasure. 

Thank you.",5,2019,08,02
147,Newly Designed Rooms are Fantastic,"Newly designed rooms are light, bright, and very well give you the space to enjoy a nights stay. Staying in a corner room 318 was amazing and the yellow colour was gorgeous. I now want my bed at home to be as comfortable!",5,2019,08,02
147,Afternoon tea ,"Bit late as catching up with my reviews but we did the Charlie and the chocolate factory afternoon tea me and my 2 daughter it was so delightful and really well
Thought out from
Steaming cocktails in a tea pot to candy floss to an endless supply of food
The whole
Afternoon was so much fun  ",5,2019,07,26
147,Just popped in for a cocktail,"We were early to meet friends for dinner and London was full to bursting.  We popped into a bar nearby and couldn’t hear ourselves think so we left.  This place was an oasis of calm, very beautiful.  The doorman was very somber but once we were in the bar we were warmly welcomed and given a complimentary drink which was lovely and much appreciated.  I’ll try making Pedro ximinez and soda at home.  The cocktails were lovely, we were given snacks and olives. It may seem a little pricey but not if you consider your surroundings, the service and the pleasure.",5,2019,07,21
147,Oh no where are the lovely chairs,"Couldn't wait to come back and try the new bar, same beautiful flowers , all lovely sparkling clean surroundings, but mostly now given over to dining, the lovely big armchairs replaced by sharing sofas, same as everywhere else . The drinks experience very disappointing, I had two glasses of champagne, not difficult surely , both not what  I asked for , I'm sure the second was sparkling wine, and as dear as the Savoy who never ever gets it wrong, plus nuts were a bit stale and £80 for four drinks should have been spot on. Used to be our go to place, not now though.  What a shame .",3,2019,07,14
147,Impressive One Aldwych Lobby Bar,"Brilliantly chilled ambiance as you walk in with no complications to get sat down. The service was an experience! i mean this in the greatest possible way. The Lady serving us, Paola, welcomed us with a great smile and wasted no time in getting us into our seats. She had a great knowledge of the drinks menu, being able to suggest drinks that were fit for our emotional requirements. Organised and efficient, the staff chat was on point and not awkward at any part of the evening. A classy place i would happily suggest to friends/ colleagues and also for myself to come to again, 1. for the fantastic service and 2. some brilliantly created cocktails. One Aldwych - 5 star",5,2019,07,11
147,Amazing!,"We were absolutely blown away by our experience. The afternoon tea was absolutely amazing. The staff were super friendly and attentive, the champagne was delicious, and the food wowed us. We loved the whimsical themes and delectable treats. If you are looking for an afternoon tea that is a bit more out of the box and fun I would highly recommend this one. ",5,2019,07,08
147,Amazing meal !,"Came here for a family meal, was very impressed - by both the service and the food! A little pricey but that's the area you're in. Would recommend to those looking for a really good meal, somewhere different. The live music was a great touch to the evening too!",5,2019,07,07
147,Afternoon Tea spectacular,"My wife and my parents visited last weekend for the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory afternoon tea and I have to say it was out of this world. 

The savouries were fantastic and the sweets were outstanding! A lot of different types of tea and cocktails to choose from but most of all the staff were faultless.  They would ask if we needed more and were very friendly with us and our baby daughter. 

I would highly recommend this for anyone visiting London and we will definitely come back again!

147,Fantastico,"Un hotel stupendo, credo il migliore a Londra. Servizio davvero ottimo e camere molto belle. Ho avuto un autista molto gentile che mi ha accompagnato in ogni posto che volessi visitare. Bellissima anche la palestra e la piscina aperta anche la mattina prestissimo.
Un gioiello a Londra!",5,2020,08,07
147,TRATO EXQUISITO,"Me alojé con mi familia tan sólo una noche, pero la experiencia fue inolvidable para todos.  La ubicación es immejorable, a tan solo 5 minutos de Covent Garden y la Opera, y a un paseo de Trafalgar Square, London Eye etc. Las habitaciones muy bonitas, elegantemente  decoradas y muy confortables. El servicio es impecable y todo el personal super amable. Especial agradecimiento a Dov Diamond (guest experience) que nos dio un cálido recibimiento y mimó mucho a mis hijos de 8 y 10 años; a Agostino (conserje) que nos dio muy buenas indicaciones y nos ayudó en todo momento; y al portero que hablaba español y que lamentablemente no me quedé con su nombre, que fue super amable; a Resty, la camarera de pisos que nos hizo la cobertura que fue encantadora. Muchas gracias a todos. Sin duda recomiendo este magnífico hotel al que espero volver pronto.",5,2020,02,07
147,"One Love, One Life","Struttura deliziosa con posizione spettacolare. Il ristorante Eneko Basque Kitchen & bar è davvero notevole. Ma più che la struttura, sicuramente di pregio e che fa della cura dei particolari uno dei suoi punti di forza, il fiore all'occhiello di questo hotel è senz'altro il personale. Competente, professionale, gentilissimo. Davvero un livello superiore a molti altri hotel della stessa categoria. Le attenzioni dedicate al cliente sono piacevolissime coccole che lasciano il segno. Davvero complimenti a tutti con una menzione speciale per chi il personale lo recluta e lo gestisce. 
La posizione poi non potrebbe davvero essere migliore. 
Camere belle e pratiche, qualità del sonno eccellente, colazione continentale assolutamente piacevole considerando gli standard della capitale. Piacevoli anche la piccola piscina, la mini-sauna e il mini-bagno turco, dove lasciarsi alle spalle le ""fatiche"" della giornata e fare il pieno d'energie per affrontare al meglio una pazza notte londinese. Altamente consigliato, sicuramente vi torneremo. 
Nel periodo di Capodanno sia l'hotel che tutta la zona (in particolare Covent Garden, raggiungibile in meno di 5 minuti a piedi) sono decorati magnificamente e creano un'atmosfera semplicemente magica.",5,2020,02,02
147,Unsere Oase in London,Das Hotel liegt zwischen Covent Garden und Trafalgar Square. Soho und Picadilly Circus sind auch nur ein Steinwurf entfernt. Nebst der Lage überzeugt das fünf Sterne Haus mit Service und moderner Einrichtung für Touristen und Geschäftsleute. Ein Hotspot um London zu Fuss zu entdecken.,5,2019,10,13
147,Excellent Hotel!,"Ein sehr schönes, sehr gut gelegenes Hotel mit hervorragendem Service. Zuvorkommendes Personal, sehr gute Concierge Dienstleistungen. Schöne, gut frequentierte Bar. Auch das SPA ist sehr zu empfehlen.",5,2019,09,21
