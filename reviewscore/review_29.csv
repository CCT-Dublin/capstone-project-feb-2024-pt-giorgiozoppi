29,Our Amazing Time in Barcelona,This hotel is beautiful. The staff is outstanding. The doorman offered us sightseeing tips and the recommendations were great. We enjoyed our time here.

29,"A fabulous, faultless hotel","This must be one of the very best hotels in Europe. Elegant, stylish and luxurious. And what a welcoming, hard-working group of staff. They made the visit extra special. The food was outstanding and every detail of it was perfect. Even something as simple as the cream cheese at breakfast - to accompany the smoked salmon - had some subtle addition that made it the best I haver ever tasted.",5,2024,10,06
29,Excellence in Service,"I recently called El Palace Hotel with a request to send an amenity to an individual at the property.
I had the pleasure of being connected to Carlos Murcia from Guest Relations. Carlos is the epitome of Service Excellence!  He was courteous, professional, communicated clearly, and took attention to my special request which required him to secure items from outside stores.
Without hesitation, Carlos immediately agreed to not only secure these items, but to follow up with me once the items were delivered to the person upon his return to the hotel, which at the time of the request was unknown.
In addition, knowing that I was calling from Miami, Carlos immediately offered a number that I could contact via Whatsapp to avoid the very expensive long-distance charges.  THIS is how you deliver the WOW factor!
Carlos, if you are reading this, do know that I have shared this story with many others in the industry as an example of best practice and TRUE HOSPITALITY EXCELLENCE.
You and your team of professionals (Elisa also reached out via Whatsapp to provide an update on the pending delivery of the items) are what set El Palace Hotel  apart from the rest.  You definitely created a Moment of Excellence for me and for the person who received the items so beautifully presented. 
Thank you again for the attention, the assistance, the professionalism, and the warmth.
I look forward to meeting you in person during my visit in October and please keep up delivering such an outstanding level of service excellence.
You are FIVE STARS!",5,2024,09,23
29,My stay at El Palace was perfect in every way… my Barcelona home.,"Recently traveling through Spain prior to a family wedding, the El Palace was our home in Barcelona.  This historic and classic hotel exudes the charm and luxury expected of a granddame, with all the amenities that appeal to not only the mature, but a chic and trendy guest. Service is paramount from check-in to check-out, at the front office to the restaurants, bars, housekeeping and throughout.

Stunning furnishings, art, and antiquities set the tone in the hotel’s public areas as well as the guest suites.  The suites are comfortably elegant with varying views… from the large French windows that opened completely, I had a beautiful view of Gran Via, flanked by a window box of colorful flowers.  The bath was quite large with an oversized walk-in shower that I appreciated.

El Palace has several great dining venues, but a highlight was a first-night anniversary celebration for my sis and hubby on a most spectacular rooftop, where tasty tapas and more delighted our palates!  To relax there is also a roof top pool, but I was sure to go to the spa for an amazing facial.",5,2024,09,20
29,El Palace Barcelona is Exceptional,"From the moment we arrived,  the El Palace staff graciously welcomed us and took wonderful care of us. Our large room was very comfortable, with all the luxuries that make this a first class hotel in Barcelona. We enjoyed the daily breakfast and the staff there were excellent. Thank you Eloi with our bags, Francisco in concierge and the rest of the kind staff that made our trip so memorable.",5,2024,09,20
29,Still putting on the Ritz,"Simply outstanding - it was the Ritz before becoming the El Palace, bit feels in every way like a Ritz experience. Amazing staff, very spacious and well appointed room. Great rooftop and great atmosphere overall. Also very well located overall.",5,2024,09,19
29,Amazing stay from start to finish,Amazing hotel with the type of service you only get at a hotel with this kind of pedigree. Facilities were amazing and the amar restaurant was a truly memorable experience and the food was second to none. From the moment you arrive to departure you feel nothing is too much trouble.,5,2024,09,18
29,Good location and historic building,"We enjoyed a four night stay in this historic hotel that packs a punch in terms of its beautiful cavernous public areas and lovely spacious bedrooms that are furnished to a high quality with a good range of amenities. The location is superb and close to the main areas of Barcelona with plenty of transport options. Concierge staff are very helpful and attentive. The roof top bar was enjoyable as was the ground floor bar although some staff lacked good hospitality skills and were rather arrogant and unhelpful. Plenty of good restaurant choices close at hand including a lovely steak house across the road. Hotels Cocktail bar was closed during our visit for some reason. Would not recommend the in-house Amar restaurant which was overrated, expensive, and not the food quality that we expected, evidenced by the lack of other patrons when we dined there.",4,2024,09,16
29,"Wonderful, special, amazing hotel",This is the place for a wonderful experience of old world charm.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly to all our needs throughout our stay.  We stayed here in 2019 and glad we came back for this visit.  Worth every dollar to stay here.  If you are coming to Barcelona this is the place to call home.,5,2024,08,31

29,A beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona!,"This was the first stop on our 10 day NCL cruise. We spent two days in Barcelona and the El Palace was just perfect. The online reservation process was easy and the hotel was very responsive with arranging our transfers from the airport to the hotel and also to the cruise ship dock.

This hotel is just perfect in every aspect! From the moment you arrive at the door to the moment you leave, someone is always there to help you with any questions you may have, your luggage or just to say good morning. 

The breakfast buffet is wonderful and you can choose from three different breakfasts. 

The hotel is so elegant and we enjoyed just sitting in the parlor having drinks and discussing our day. 

The room were absolutely gorgeous and so clean, you could not ask for anything better.

This is a great hotel. It is centrally located and just outside the Gothic district. This is a great choice for the discerning traveler who wants to be close to action (Gothic) without having to deal with the crowds and noise of that busy area.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Barcelona and is looking for a high quality place to stay.",5,2024,08,24
29,Old World Elegance in Barcelona,We arrived in Barcelona after a 10 day cruise to finish our vacation for 2 nights.  El Palace is a perfect place to stay.  We arrived at 10 am and our rooms were ready; keys are old school that you leave with the concierge.  The rooms are elegant with modern amenities and a wonderful bathroom with a rain shower and separate tub.  The breakfast was included and it was an ample buffet in a beautiful space with excellent service.  On the roof is a swimming pool and bar/restuarant which is a great oasis from the summer heat.  The location could not be better; about a 15 minute walk to the gothic quarter and las ramblas and a 5 minute walk to all of the shopping.  I will definitely return!,5,2024,08,12
29,Best hotel ever…,"My wife and I stayed at the palace hotel and we both felt like we had the best hotel experience ever at the palace.. the rooms are amazing, spotless and the beds are very comfortable. Overall all employees were very nice and very helpful especially this young gentleman named Moises who really made us feel very special and gave us plenty of good tips, we could tell that he is a real hospitality professional who truly dedicate himself on providing excellent customer service too his guests… thank you so much Moisés and to the rest of the team… we will be back 100%

29,"Wonderful stay at El Palace, Barcelona.","I have been traveling all over the world, and stayed in many luxury hotels, but El Palace takes the lead in terms friendly staff, super nice rooms/suites, and excellent food. Besides that, the location is great. If you don´t feel like walking, you can always hire a driver, and lean back in The Mercedes Maybach that El Palace has....;)",5,2024,07,28
29,Excellent,"Excellent accommodations!  Great breakfast and the rooftop restaurant was beautiful.  Concierge (Alexsis) was best concierge we have ever encountered. 
Should we visit Barcelona again, we will surely stay at El Palace.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",5,2024,07,25
29,Exquisite in every aspect!  For a very reasonable price.,"This hotel is spectacular in every aspect!  At check-in, you are met by the uniformed staff who will deliver your luggage to your room. Your room is cleaned each morning and they still have a turn-down service.  The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make every interaction special.  The grounds are meticulously cleaned and manicured.  The rooftop bar/garden/pool are luxurious! The attention to detail makes it very special. One evening we inquired about the coffee table book about the hotel itself and we had an intriguing conversation with the staff who showed us a guestbook signed by tons of royalty and famous people!  Then they gave us a private tour of the speakeasy bar (which was closed at that time.)  I highly recommend this special hotel and hope to return one day.",5,2024,07,23
29,Historical gem with stellar service,"Beautiful hotel steeped in history with past guests including a long list of celebrities.  They provide a historical book on the hotel in the room which gives a wonderful story of the glamour and ""Ritz"".  We stayed in a Family Suite which included three separate bedrooms connected by a hallway.  This setup was perfect for teenage children who love their own space and for the adults who do as well!  The service at this hotel was beyond 5 star.  Every single staff member was helpful, courteous and over all a joy to talk to.  They go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of.   Most of the staff speak beautiful English as well as Spanish and Catalan.  The restaurant staff is one of the most hard working crews we have encountered often working the breakfast shift and then lunch at the roof pool.  The location of the hotel made it possible to walk to most of the tourist sites.",5,2024,07,15
29,"Lovely hotel, amazing people, great location","Lovely classic hotel in an amazing hotel. The rooms are very spacious and fitted with all the modern touches with a classic twist (the classic antique looking mirror is the TV, the minibar is hidden behind a painting). 

The rooftop has excellent views of the city, the breakfast is lovely and the people working there are amazing. I was touched that I got a slice of cake and a nice note sent up to my room because it was my birthday. They sent it a day early because I was checking out the following day!

The gym is very basic with only a view treadmills and an eclipse machine but guests can use the gym across the street for an extra charge of €10…will definitley stay there again!

The consierge service really went out of their way to help with all our reservations",5,2024,07,08
29,Amazing Service!!!,"Cannot say enough about this wonderful hotel!  Checked in with my 10 year old son who got very sick on the flight from the US.  The amazing staff arranged a doctor to visit within an hour of checking in and then sent a bellman to literally run (like a mile) to the pharmacy before it closed to get his antibiotic prescription.  They then delivered crackers, ginger ale, and ice cream (for strep throat).  I was blown away by their kindness and attention to detail.  I will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona and will be forever grateful for everything they did for us.  The rooms and lobby were amazing as well!!  Much love to them all 🙏🙏",5,2024,07,07
29,Excellent property and experience!,"This has to be one of my favorite hotels that we’ve experienced. They checked all the boxes with outstanding facilities, rooms, food, location and staff. Our family of four had connecting rooms that were spacious, well appointed, clean, quiet, and comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance to many areas. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast, which was delicious and served in a lovely room. We also frequented the rooftop lounge which we all loved. The staff was friendly, accommodating and always happy and eager to assist. They took great care all around! I can’t say enough about the wonderful experience at Hotel El Palace. We will be back!",5,2024,07,05
29,Lives upto its name. An excellent hotel,"I booked the hotel after a lot of survey on various properties available in Barcelona. Our experience was very positive in most aspects. 
The staff attitude is very good (rate for hotels in Europe, even 5 star ones), the room quality and size was excellent and facilities were very good. 
Food quality was also very good and responsive to any needs was also very fast.
The hotel has an excellent location which is just off the busiest tourist area and also at walking distance which is actually the best

Highly recommended",5,2024,07,03
29,"Excellent hotel, very poor wifi","This is an excellent hotel which was previously a Ritz hotel so very high class decor. The rooms are good and spacious. The roof top restaurant and bar is worth a visit. One huge drawback, for me, in this digital age is the extreme slowness of the wifi offered. I could barely do my work emails. So if wifi is not an important requirement I would highly recommend a stay here when in Barcelona.",3,2024,07,02
29,Couple holiday,"Beautiful hotel, staff are very friendly and helpful. Amazing spread at breakfast and rooftop bar has great vibes. 
Hotel is very well located. All tourist destinations can be easily accessed by walking or the metro is a few steps away. Lots of good restaurants and bars in the nearby area",5,2024,06,28
29,Beautiful stay,"Great rooms, lovely attendants all around, they all look to care for your needs even before you know you have one. Great beds, clean all around. Safe hotel, plenty of staff. The rooftop terrace has an amazing view of the city and has different levels and amazing gardens and the pool. Great food, the bartender Favio had our daughter make her own “cocktail” and Domingo took amazing care of us. Eduardo was a great waiter at the breakfast buffet (amazing buffet) and Mar at the Amar restaurant was also great.",5,2024,06,27
29,Truly Magnificent,"Wonderful incredible stay at El Palace hotel in Barcelona . 
Great location, beautiful surrounding atmosphere, great staff. Most friendly and helpful concierge , lovely and great first impression of hotel. Everything about the hotel was exceptional. It was clean, gorgeous , roomy with excellent food & service . Food was delicious especially at Amar the Michelin restaurant and great value for money and service was attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I was very pleased with my entire stay . I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",5,2024,06,26
29,Great stay & staff!,"I recently stayed at Hotel Palace Barcelona and had a fantastic experience. The room was incredibly comfortable, and the terrace offered stunning views. One night, there was a bit of noise from the rooftop, but it ended quickly. The breakfast was delicious, and we wished we could have stayed a couple more nights. PS: The service from all the concierges and Sergio at reception was outstanding.",5,2024,06,25
29,Rooftop stole euros,"Hotel has cool vibes. We didn’t stay here, but booked a table on the rooftop. Everyone was friendly, great atmosphere, average food. Would recommend based on that. However, do not pay with cash!! Went there tonight, paid in euros and even left a tip, but as we were getting on the elevator to leave, the waitress informed us we were $20 short. We tipped more than this. Being tourists we were taken advantage of. I would still go back.. but beat advise.. use a card!!!",2,2024,06,24
29,Old world charm with 7 star luxury!,"This is undoubtedly the best hotel in Barcelona.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and well appointed.  Service is top notch. Everyone is extremely helpful. In terms of luxury, there is nothing better than El Palace.  The location is very central.  

One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in with bed linen to die for! 

Kudos to the staff, 7 stars in all respects.",5,2024,06,21
29,El palace review,"Abbas Barcelona is definitely hotel. I would recommend. The location is incredible. You can walk to restaurants and shopping with a 15 minute distance. The room and bathroom were very comfortable. The concierge was extremely helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The only recommendation I gave to the hotel is to provide more bottles of water to families. They only gave two small bottles per day, which was obviously not enough for family of four. We had to walk to the close by Aldi supermarket and get more water bottles. But otherwise, the day was excellent.",5,2024,06,20
29,Best Tea time,"I come monthly to the tea time experience and the team is delightful ! The food is has good if not better than some I had in london and I wish more people would have the chance to come by to enjoy this tea time! 

I can’t thanks the team enough! They even offered me lovely dessert for my birthday which really cheered me up and showed me how much they care for their customers!

it is definitely an experience to have and share! 🫶☺️",5,2024,06,19
29,Fabulous Hotel,Excellent hotel and great location. Superb breakfast & the rooms were very spacious and large and the bathrooms were beautiful . The breakfast buffet was spectacular in a beautiful room and the terrace was beautiful . The staff was extremely friendly also.,5,2024,06,18
29,First time but not the last,"First time but not the Last.

Our recent stay in Barcelona has been so more special thanks to the great staff of El Palace Barcelona. Our driver dropped us at the front of the hotel and from that moment the staff has been helping us and providing an excellent service. Room was nice and very well decorated. The facilities were cleaned every day and the terrace was our favorite part of the hotel. The location was perfect and shops and restaurants were close by. We want to thank all the staff again, specially to sergio on reception and the guys from Bluesman, the classic bar that they have on the basement. See you!",5,2024,06,18
29,Best Hotel in Barcelona,Best hotel we ever stayed at and we travel a lot … elegant classy cheerful professional majestic … every detail perfect… best trained staff we have ever experienced…from the comfortable beds to the general romantic ambience of the entire hotel …to the garden court Restaurant and  the roof  top cafe …simply without exception .. perfect…. Ending at the bar in the lounge where Fabio made us the best cocktails we have ever had … a complete total perfect experience and ps…the doorman out side …I don’t think we ever waited 5 seconds for a taxi!   We will return !,5,2024,06,18
29,A 5 star grand dame in the heart of the city!,This is a grand dame 5 star hotel in a perfect position for exploring. We felt like we were in Bridgeton with the beautiful ball room and the fabulous staircase. The hotel is a true 5 star experience / from the moment we arrived the staff went out of their way to provide us with exemplary service. Restaurant tips were spot on and the breakfast was one of our best in Europe. Our bathroom had been fully renovated and the shower was the size of a king size bed! We found this hotel to be exactly as advertised - a beautiful grand hotel with service to match. Would not hesitate to stay here again!,5,2024,06,11
29,An elegant luxury hotel and comfortable home away from home,"El Palace is a gorgeous and elegant hotel which provided luxury service and a luxury stay for our week in Barcelona. We had a superior room on the 6th floor with a balcony and amazing view of the Gran Via street as well as Tibidabo mountain and the basilica in the distance (beautiful view at sunset). From the moment we checked in and received a map and restaurant advice from the concierge, to when we were shown to our room with an explanation of the amenities (including a gift of cava and chocolates), we enjoyed the facilities and creature comforts provided by the hotel and staff.  The room was very clean and comfortable, amazing bed to sink into at the end of the day, luxurious bathroom and spacious walk-in closet/dressing room. All of the restaurants are lovely - we particularly enjoyed the Rooftop Bar and restaurant with 360 degree views of the city, the Bluesman Cocktail Lounge with live music, as well as the full breakfast via room service. The finer details such as the nightly turn down service, the bathroom amenities and the attentive front door staff (especially when needing a cab) made this hotel a welcome place to come back to after touring each day and going out each night. The location in Eixample is also safe and convenient, with a 10-12 minute walk to Plaça Catalunya, the Gothic Quarter, the Passeig de Gràcia, and the North and South Ramblas. The only thing I would change is the bulky room key. However I would recommend El Palace hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona - the city is beautiful and so is this hotel.",5,2024,06,08
29,Once bitten...,"Bad pillows
Cold room with wet carpet,had to change room
Bar staff on rooftop ignored us 
Towels were not gven every day 
Asked for ice,took 4 hours 
Turn down service was great the first night then very little was done other nights
Used glasses not changed,had to ask for more
They had a party one night and we were refused entry to the rooftop which was one of the main reasons we booked there.",2,2024,06,05
29,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"The accommodations and the staff were great. Alex the concierge was pleasant and helpful. It was a nice location. The room was comfortable and quiet. There was a coffee maker in the room.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and the breakfast room was charming. 
We would stay here again.",5,2024,05,20
29,Lunch at the Rooftop Garden restaurant,"We had lunch on the Rooftop. The restaurant, bar and pool are stunning. It’s truly beautiful. However the service was not up to a 5 star hotel. We had a reservation for 1pm. When we arrived the hostess was also the waitress. The bartender was busy too. Eventually another 2 waitresses came up. But it took a half hour for drinks, longer for a tomato salad and 3 sure items. We asked for a second round of cocktails and they came after we had finished our luncheon. 
But the salad, the crispy chicken and the potatoes were delicious!  We did not care for the croquettes as much. They were bland. 
We certainly would go back though.",4,2024,05,14
29,Unrivaled luxury at superb location with amazing staff,"We have seen quite some hotels of the LHW network though the El Palace really stands out! Great location in the bustling city center of Barcelona, though with a nice and stylish atmosphere inside and the most superb staff. Contact with all departments has been great. Thank you so much for an unforgettable holiday",5,2024,05,12
29,Bravoo!,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Palace Barcelona and loved every bit of it, especially the classic luxury vibe of the rooms. The staff was super efficient, making everything smooth and easy for us.

We did run into a little snag with the air conditioning in our room. But no worries, Sergio at the front desk was all over it. He couldn't fix it right away, but he handled it like a champ, offering us another room quickly and with a smile. His way of talking and dealing with guests was just super impressive!

Also, can't forget to mention the unique smell of the hotel and the awesome terrace. These were definitely highlights for us. It’s clear that stuff can go wrong anywhere, but having this accurate service and staff around makes all the difference. We’re really happy with our stay and will totally be back. It was a unique experience that we totally loved.",5,2024,05,12
29,The food and beverage service were great.,"HotelEl Palace was magnificent.  Not only is it beautiful and in a great location, but the staff members go the extra mile to help make sure every guest has a fabulous experience.  EVERYONE we encountered from reception staff, concierge, door people, aitstaff were professional and courteous.  We loved the hotel amenities - especially the rooftop bar and downstairs lounge.",5,2024,05,06
29,quite good,"they really nail the vibe of timeless elegance with modern touches and fantastic service. the concierges were very helpful with restaurant recommendations, most were good and some were truly excellent. we loved the location because it was an easy walk to the touristy stuff but a bit removed and close to restaurants and safe night time strolling. very accommodating to us with a toddler, though the wait staff didn't seem too thrilled when we tried to get desserts in The Hall one night, but we aren't really the target demographic so we kind of understood. all in all, if you choose a place like this you know what you are looking for and they definitely deliver. ",5,2024,05,02
29,10 out of 10!,"We stayed at El Palace hotel for six nights. What a gem! Guest services were top notch. We will never forget the lavish and delicious breakfast we had every day. The common rooms are beautiful and comfortable. We also spent a couple hours at the Bluesman bar downstairs and had fun listening to the live music. The rooftop bar/restaurant was also a great place for a glass of sangria and lunch. Our room was super comfortable with a roomy, newly refurbished bathroom. A 10 out of 10 experience. ",5,2024,04,28
29,Beauty and Traditional Excellence Await at this grand hotel.,"It doesn’t get any better than this hotel. 5 star + service. This hotel is run the way the way 5 star hotels were run before Covid decimated the travel industry. The concierge team are top notch, with thorough and thoughtful advice for visiting Barcelona. Of course the hotel is stunningly beautiful. Tradition and excellence abounds for those who delight in old world surroundings and service. Nothing is out of place and it shines with care.",5,2024,04,13
29,Memorable experience at an elegant hotel,"This was my second stay at the El Palace hotel in Barcelona.  As with my first, I was very pleased with my experience. The hotel has an elegance and grace that is reminiscent of the gilded epoch of the first half of the 20th century;  from grand entrance, staff personal attention, personnel uniforms, irreproachable service throughout, fine china, exquisitely appointed and decorated room, importance given to every details, to the tasseled room key.  Spending a few days at the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona is truly an experience in and of itself very much worth while.",5,2024,04,13
29,Perfect oasis of elegance,"This hotel is an elegant step back in time with all the modern amenities. We booked a junior suite which had ample space to unpack and relax and the bedding is sublime. The rooftop bar/pool is a must with breathtaking views of the Cathedral, Sangrada Familia, mountains, and harbor and, their croquettes and patatas bravas are some of the best we have had.  The concierge was extremely helpful booking a last minute tour and not only providing restaurant recommendations but making our reservations.  If you happen to be there Thur-Sat and enjoy live music and high end cocktails, make a reservation for the Speakeasy located below the lobby.  It was the perfect end to our week in Barcelona.",5,2024,04,09
29,Truly Great Hotel,"What an amazing hotel. We had a two-room suite which was spacious and well-appointed. As some have said, the inner courtyard view is nothing to write home about, but it didn't matter because the room was amazing and above all else...the service was exceptional. The friendliness of all the hotel staff and their willingness to help with anything was very much appreciated. The lobby is beautiful and relaxing. We didn't have a chance to really enjoy the rooftop because the weather was cold and wet, but the views from there are amazing. The layout was also very inviting.",5,2024,04,05
29,A Palace in every sense,"This is a fantastic hotel and I would have given it 5 stars, but for the fact that it needlessly nickel and dimes guests for stupid things.  For example, there is a nice breakfast buffet, but if you want to order fresh cooked eggs or an omelet there is a “surcharge.”  They give you two complementary bottles of water each day, but if you ask for any additional water they charge you.  Other than that, the hotel is beautiful, the room was very comfortable, the staff was great and the location is perfect.  Would stay there again in a minute.",4,2024,04,05
29,Interesting hotel,"Great location, nice atmosphere, amazing breakfasts. 
The staff is friendly and very diligent. 
Special mention should be made of the concierge team - bravo! Rarely met such quality work. 
From minuses it is possible to note that rather old rooms and it is felt, well and would be desirable a little more sensitive service in a lobby bar (superfluous to your table will not come up). 
But overall the experience is very good and I can recommend it as a hotel for the whole family.
All the best 
Vladimir",5,2024,04,05
29,Charming style and outstanding service,"Old European style with all the modern technological updates.  Our stay at El Palace couldn't have been more delightful.  The historic background of this hotel combined with its staff, modern conveniences and location were perfect!  Everyone on staff from those that checked us in to the outstanding concierges and bellhops went were outstanding. Our breakfast at the hotel was excellent as was the service in the general  restaurant and bar areas. The roof top bar offers a relaxing way to take in top of the city views.  The bed linens were oh so comfortable.
If you like old style ambience, detailed service and want the comforts technology has to offer this is the hotel for you!",5,2024,04,05
29,Don't get tricked booking hotels,"Not due to go away until June 2024. We booked the hotel through its website (or so we thought) be careful as it is a independent reservations company called guest reservation.  We needed to cancel. They refused to refund our money, although when I called the hotel they said if we booked direct they would have given 100% refund, they were very sympathetic and agreed it was misleading.  I also found that for 4 nights, guest reservation were £353.00 more expensive when compared on other booking sites. They refused to match this. This was less than 24 hours after I booked that they wanted 100% cancelation fee. Be careful when booking as guest relations it is tricking people into thinking its the hotel that you are booking directly. Dishonest, sly and personally I think misrepresentation.  Finally on guest relations when you click my booking it goes to getaroom.com and your reservation does not come up. Disgraceful!!",1,2024,04,04
29," Not a 5 star experience","We chose this place as we wanted to treat ourselves to a 5 star experience. It's advertised as a 5 star hotel so we were excited about staying somewhere with that type of service and luxury.
The check in experience was good. The receptionist was very friendly and made us feel welcome.
The room was comfortable and had a large bathroom. However, we soon noticed a couple of things below par.
For example, the double bed we were expecting turned out to be two singles pushed together. One of the plug sockets was loose and unsafe. The shower kept dripping and we were woken up every morning to a loud sound. We reported the noise on day one, and concierge said they would check it. They said they checked it but couldn't hear anything but each day we reported it and on the last day they said we could change rooms (this was our 4th day...).
Apart from all of the above, the hall was lovely to sit in and some of the staff were friendly. The cocktail I had was lovely and the service in the hall was very good.

Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you want a 5 star experience",3,2024,04,04
29,Maria,"The service was excellent. They strive to provide first class service. Very attentive to details. Our stay was excellent. My husband likes to have his meals with hot sauces. The restaurant staff provided every possible type of hot peppers they could find and had them ready for him and his sister, every morning for breakfast. I really can not describe the service, except to say it was superb. Definitely recommend it.",5,2024,04,04
29,Highly recommend!!!,"This was our first time at El Palace and we were thrilled with the experience.  It is a beautiful hotel - elegant, but comfortable.  The staff was delightful - extremely friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was spectacular and the breakfast room was lovely.   The roof garden is wonderful.  It is a perfect location.  Everything about the experience was extremely positive.",5,2024,04,03
29,Perfection and the staff were kind,مكان رائع جدا ويستحق كل التقدير والثناء خصيصا تعامل الموظفين المتواجدين هناك everything was perfect  especially the staff treatment especially Sergi from the front desk and also Daria the blonde from guest relations . Definitely recommended my friends to go there,5,2024,04,03
29,Superb hotel in a central location,"What a superb hotel.  The decor was stunning and the service was excellent.  We had a one bed suite and our adult daughter slept in the living room on a sofa bed.  The rooms were very comfortable, the bathroom was enormous.  The view from the roof terrace was very impressive, although the pool is quite small I am sure on a hot day it would be nice to have a dip.

In the evening we had cocktails and snacks in the amazing bar area which is more like a ballroom.  These were reasonably priced and delicious.

What strikes you most about this hotel, (after the opulent decor and furnishings) is the wonderful courtesy and service of the staff. The doormen were particulalry friendly and courteous but every member of staff was considerate and welcoming.  If we visit Barcelona again we will definitely want to stay here. It was a wonderful experience.",5,2024,04,03
29,gracious hospitality in a classic and beautiful environment,"To be a guest at the Hotel El Palace Barcelona is to spend time in utopia. Civility and gracious hospitality coupled with extraordinary professionalism made our recent  stay  a very memorable one. Every day my wife and I felt welcomed by every staff person we encountered. And to live in the hotel's classically beautiful, and beautifully maintained  public and private rooms was a very special part of our experience.
Kudos to management and staff for achieving the level of hospitality and customer service maintained at this magnificent hotel.",5,2024,03,27
29,Love to go back on our next visit,"Location is great snd safe. Literally walking distance to most spots to go. Room is big and service is excellent. Great size and clean bathroom. 

We have had a terrific experience and relaxing stay. Only thing is the pool on the roof is too cold to use.",5,2024,03,26
29,Nice stay... again!!!!,"Second time on the hotel and It has been even better. They are currently doing a renovation on the bathrooms and It clearly  makes a big difference. This time I've to highlight the service from two people, Sergio on the front desk and Fabio on the Hall. We enjoyed of a nice dinner on El Chalet, so original and TASTY. Hoping to return next year again. Congrats to all the staff.",5,2024,03,21
29,Classic hotel experience,"Wonderful old world hotel.  The staff is truly exceptional, attentive to every detail of the guest experience in a very natural and unforced manner.  The hotel combines the grandeur of a great old Ritz Carlton hotel with all of the modern comforts. In addition the quiet luxury of our room, with geraniums in bloom on our windowsill, the hotel also offers numerous other amenities.  The Amar Restaurant, the Bluesman Lounge, the rooftop pool area, and the breakfast conservatory all offered exceptional guest experiences as well.  The location of the hotel, just north of the Gothic Barri, is also ideal.  The concierge service readily arranged tickets for us to the various wonderful architectural structures and museums.",5,2024,03,14
29,"A terrific evening on the top of "" The Palace""","The very best. We had an enjoyable evening on top of The Palace. Waiters were very attentive. Excel·lent foodies. Terrific views.
Cosy atmosphere. A niece experience at The Palace, near the clouds.
We felt really at home with such incredible staff",5,2024,03,11
29,Outstanding,"Beautiful hotel with great amenities! Feels classic and grand in every way. The rooftop pool and lounge area is gorgeous on its own, but I love that they incorporated a Swiss chalet theme for the winter. Very cozy and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Speaking of, hotel location is excellent. Close to multiple metro stops but we mostly walked everywhere. The best part of all, however, was the staff. Housekeeping is outstanding - our room was immaculate every day and they were incredibly responsive when we called with requests. Everyone we encountered was warm, helpful, and treated our family, especially the kids, with true kindness and hospitality! Especially the bartenders, who gave our kids some impromptu mocktail making lessons :) Thank you for making our visit so memorable!",5,2024,03,09
29,-,"For which of the following faciSorry for sharing this comments.
It was very nice stay except one thing which is baggage service at bell desk.
After check-out, I asked to bell desk team to keep my luggage included my Saint Laurent Hand Bag.
I was very embarrassed when I found a baggage sticker on my bag.
After I took a sticker off, I checked condition of bag and there are some scratch on the bottom of bags.
I was very-very upset and complained to a man at concierge desk.
He also embarrassed and gave me a business card of room manager with apology. 
I was surprised that the way you handling customer's belongings at bell desk.
It can be possible to happen this situation at 5 stars hotel from my experience.
The bag is not top-lined brand however it has a value for me.
I would like to suggest the manager should retrain staffs to prevent this happening again.

29,Amazing 5 stars experience,The experience we had was just incredible. The attention to details is amazing. They are very good at exceeding expectations.

29,"Exquisite Cuisine, Exceptional Service: My Enchanting Experience at Hotel El Palace Barcelona","This hotel surpassed expectations with its exquisite food and impeccable service. As an Indian, I was delighted by the authentic flavors and warm hospitality. From delectable dishes to attentive staff, every aspect of the service is memorable. Highly recommended for those craving a taste with exceptional service.",5,2024,02,25
29,Superb stay at the El Palace.,"Superb welcome and attention to our needs. The room was big, quiet, very clean and comfortable. The bed comfort and quality was exceptional. Excellent food and service at the Amar and Hall restaurants. Great breakfast buffet. An experience to repeat. We will come back!",5,2024,02,24
29,Unforgettable,"Wonderful hotel. Very friendly and dedicated staff, amazing facility. Roof top Chalet and Bluesman Bar were exceptional. Amar Restaurant is in the Michelin guide. 1919 established 5 star hotel deserves every penny. Had a wonderful honeymoon with my wife at El Palace and in Barcelona",5,2024,02,23
29,Charming hotel… but the service/facility offering is no value for money,"Pros: 
The hotel itself is beautiful with oldschool charm. Some of the staff members are very friendly (though the majority are nonchalant with a prevalent CAN‘T DO attitude) . 
The location is itself very convenient.

Cons:
The cleanliness is not through, I checked in and found a used cottonbud in the dustbin from the previous guest… the shower compartment itself is full of calc stains.
Moreover I’m appalled that even as a guest at the hotel, I have to pay ‚‘minimum spend‘ to sit at the hotel bar…and would have to pay for any entertainment offered at the hotel in general. Worse still is that a guest would have to pay to use the Sauna at the hotel spa. 
I have never experienced that in a five star hotel, I’d expect that to be the business model of a budget hotel… completely shocked!",1,2024,02,22
29,Great stay with very attentive staff,"Luxury property that feels like you stepped back in time, but still with modern amenities.  Wonderful bar, restaurant experiences, don't miss the rooftop views at night.  Explore the entire rooftop, much to see from various viewpoints.  Rooms are beautiful, we had a great view of the city, but also with excellent soundproof windows, doors.  Service was on the level of butler service, call for anything and it arrives in moments.  Bathroom was very modern with separate tub and shower,   Great cocktails in lobby bar, enjoyed the tea on a lazy afternoon as well.  Read about the hotel's history if you get the chance.
If you are staying over the weekend , don't miss the live music at the downstairs bar.  We thought we would have a couple of cocktails and head off to bed, but found ourselves laughing all the way back to our room at 2 AM.  So much fun.  Tiny venue, but a unique surprise!",5,2024,02,21
29,Fantastic Experience,"I had the pleasure to take part in the Black and White Masquerade dinner, and it was such a stunning  and classy event, so much attention for detail...

Thanks so much for such memorable event, hoping to come again on the next edition.

Caio Belfiori.",5,2024,02,13
29,We felt like 'Guests' not 'Customers',"Situated on the Gran Via, a stone's throw away from Plaza Catalunya, the hotel oozes old world charm. The decor across the whole hotel was a world away from modern charmless glass towers. Despite the hotel's age, the furniture was in perfect condition and the bed and the amenities were excellent.

The staff were most helpful and friendly. I was impressed with their prefessionalism from the reception staff and concierge, to the restaurant and cleaning staff. They made us feel like we were 'guests' as opposed to 'customers'. 

The breakfast was excellent, with all the usual Spanish and Eurpean fare.

Nothing to dislike. So much so that I promised the receptionist we will be staying at the Palace whenever we visit Barcelona in the future",5,2024,02,11
29,Great experience,"I traveled for family vacations, the Hotel is well preparated to offer an excellent stay, is quiet and well located.

It was an excellent vacation, I will come back for sure!",5,2024,02,10
29,Great experience,"Our three-day stay at the 5-star hotel near the city center was a memorable and enriching experience. From the lavish accommodations to the impeccable service, every aspect of our stay contributed to a truly exceptional family getaway. 
The basement bar, with its intimate and stylish ambiance, transported us to another era. The live music performance was really great, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
If you're looking to combine luxury, convenience, and family-friendly features, this hotel undoubtedly deserves consideration.",5,2024,02,09
29,Wonderful!,"I had a wonderful stay at the Hotel El Palace. Staff is incredibly professional, discreet and helpful. Service was impeccable throughout my whole stay. The terrace, pool and restaurant are amazing! I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will definitely go back next time I am in Barcelona!",5,2024,02,09
29,The perfect afternoon,"I had the perfect afternoon at the Palace Hotel, because since I arrived I feel at home and with the kindness of all the staff. Although I make more use of the bar and terrace, I have also had the opportunity to stay and it has been a unique experience. Thank you all for how you have made me feel. (There are few places where one can feel like this in Barcelona)",5,2024,02,09
29,"Amazing hotel , and amazing staff.","I had a meeting/ presentation with some of my friends, and clients and It was really special.

29,Grand hotel in Barcelona,"El Palace Barcelona is a beautiful palatial property in an excellent location for sightseeing!  It is walking distance to many restaurants and 2 blocks from the main shopping street.  I booked a Classic Room via AMEX FHR website. We received breakfast for 2, $100 hotel credit and late check-out.  We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was very elegant and had historic features. Our view was a street. Bathroom was huge. It had a double sink, double shower and separate commode room with water facilities. They give only one room key because of the unique style of the key. Breakfast was very good. There is something for everyone and plenty of seating. We had the afternoon tea which was very nice.  Ordered ice cream room service one night. Very good. Used the Mayan spa and had a great massage. Service was excellent. Everyone working in the lobby was very helpful.  There are many choices in this hotel category in Barcelona and we were happy with this choice.  I recommend this grand hotel for it's beauty, service and location.

I would like to point out for AMEX FHR cardholders, we were not able to get a space available upgrade because the next level up was having carpets change. There were rooms above that category available but they said their policy is only to upgrade one level.",5,2024,02,07
29,Amazing!!,It has to be the best hotel in Barcelona!!!central to all the places you would want to visit but at the same time away from the tourist traps. Everything is within walking distance. Will come back and stay again for sure. Keep up the great work guys!!!,5,2024,02,07
29,"Lovely 5 Star, but the Staff really set it apart.","In terms of comfort and luxury, this hotel delivers everything you would expect for a 5 star hotel. Our room was beautiful. The hotel decor is spectacular especially in the main lobby and bar. The hotel location is ideal for getting around with Placa del Catalunya only a 10 minute walk and Passeig de Gràcia 5 minutes walk. 

For us what sets El Palace apart from other 5 star hotels are the staff. From the moment the concierge opened the door of the taxi, everyone is pleased to see you and wants to make your stay the best it can be. Every member of staff we encountered smiled and said hello throughout our whole stay.

On my birthday, a cake with a candle and a lovely note was left wishing me a Happy Birthday from the team. 

Thank you so much El Palace for a wonderful stay. We will be back soon.",5,2024,02,07
29,Elegance and luxury,"El Palace is a hotel of very high quality whose staff make your experience one to remember. Their care from your arrival to your departure is second to none. 
All the rooms are extremely comfortable , well furnished with large beds dressed with crisp white linen. - Difficult to get out of even if you have a lot of sightseeing to do. The bathrooms are modern and stocked with lovely toiletries Cleanliness is  remarkable. 
The hotel is complimented by the Mayan spa. Our return visit was to make use of the  spa facilities and we were not disappointed. The practitioners are very friendly and both the massages and facials are very relaxing
Amar restaurant is located within the hotel. It has a varied menu that specialises in Mediterranean dishes. Our sole was expertly cooked and served. A dish I will long remember. The restaurant oozes elegance and you can easily feel the ambience of the old Ritz hotel
El Palace is mid- priced, some may feel expensive, but this is a hotel where you actually get what you pay for. You get quality, luxury, great service and comfort that all together amounts to unforgettable stay. Treat yourselves to a great experience in the great city of Barcelona. We did and had a great time",5,2024,02,05
29,Luxury and confortable,"Great experience. Willin and friendly staff. Rooms are really nice, Classic decoracion With Modern comforts. We really enjoyed dinner at the rooftop  restaurant the Chalet (swiss fondeu) and drinks at Bluesman club with good life music. Highly recommended",5,2024,01,29
29,FAB-U-LOUS!!!!  Deserves more than the 5 stars I can award in here….,"This place is just perfect! Other hotels need to go, watch and learn. 

We stayed for 3 nights for. 26-29th January.  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi the whole experience was exceptional. 

We’ve been lucky enough to stay in some beautiful hotels all over the world but the one thing that makes El Palace stand out is the staff. Everyone is friendly (and will share a joke with you), professional, helpful and engaging. As soon as they have your room number  you are addressed by name. The service is comparable to many Michelin  starred restaurant. Discrete, efficient and timely. 

One of many examples…we rang for an iron and ironing board. No sooner had we put down the phone there was a knock at the door. 

We couldn’t fault this hotel. Everything is just lovely and it’s like stepping back in time……you are made to feel like the only people in the hotel. 

Thank you to each and every one of the team at El Palace. Please don’t ever change!",5,2024,01,29
29,Afternoon tea review - more than ok but not particularly special,"Came as a walk-in for afternoon tea, which is the caveat for my review in case the unplanned nature of the tea factors into the experience I'm sharing. 

The pros - the ambience is very reminiscent of tea at The Plaza in NYC - same vibe, same type of decor, same old school sense of place. The quality of the food was very good - above par for the US, on/slightly below par for London and Paris. Price point was very good.

The cons - not a great service experience at all. Server was very pleasant and helpful and attentive. But: I was made to check and see if a table could be made available for me, when the place was empty of all but 2 tables (nor were there pending reservations). Food was served before my tea order was taken. I was told that the scones were ""fresh out of the oven"" when actually they were cold.",3,2024,01,27
29,Luxury hotel,"A beautiful and luxurious hotel in all aspects. Excellent location, wonderful reception and staff, especially Mrs. Amal, and aspects of the hotel such as the lobby and bedrooms are very comfortable.

29,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,We enjoyed our stay very much. The staff are sincerely pleasant and very helpful. The location was perfect for us. Not far from La Rambla but away from the noise. The location is very convenient to La Plaza de Catalunya and dining in l'Eixample. The hotel is beautiful inside and outside.,5,2024,01,24
29,Luxury Experience in Eixample,"Absolutely wonderful property and staff - they made our entire Family (including 2 kids ten years old) feel welcome and pampered. Go for the suite! The bathroom is extravagant, shower big enough to wash a pony. 

Not a knock or complaint, but be aware that their wonderful basement speakeasy/bar (Bluesman) only open Thursday-Saturday, so keep in mind when making your reservation.",5,2024,01,10
29,The best luxury hotel in Barcelona!,"Stunningly beautiful hotel with the best service and  great food. Everyone I encountered was very kind and helpful. 
The breakfast buffet was outstanding, not just the food but more importantly the staff. The entrance staff was mindful of the wheelchair need with editing and entering hotel. The Concierge was very helpful with confirming and canceling reservations. 
The Front desk staff was very attentive to our needs. We will definitely come back.",5,2024,01,05
29,Wonderful partnership and private lunch at El Palace !,"We organized a trip for a group and had a wonderful experience with El Palace. We asked for a group offer on the rooms and Clara, our contact was such a great help and very easy to communicate with. The people of the group who stayed at El Palace absolutely loved the place but most of it the service which was kind and helpful. We also organized a private gourmet lunch on the rooftop of the hotel in their ""winter garden"" and it was an absolute delight. The food was very delicate and the service was perfect from A to Z. This is a must go and see ! Thanks again to Clara and all the staff of El Palace. ",5,2024,01,03
29,Best in Barcelona - chic & classic - especially festive around the holidays!,"I haven't been to Barcelona in years and this past December I was fortunate to go at Christmas time.  The city is so stunning and friendly and decorated - as is the gorgeous El Palace Barcelona Hotel.  It was so festive and cheery in the hotel lobby and the service was super.  We had an incredible meal at Amar the chic seafood restaurant with a very cool chef - Rafa Zafru.  One of the better surprises was the jazz speakeasy - we heard such rockin' fun & funky music until well after hours.  Another little treat was a cozy movie on the roof -- even in the winter they gave us blankets, popcorn, cocktails & hot chocolate.  It wasn't something we planned on but so glad we did because it was exclusive and fun.  We walked everywhere we wanted to get to in Barcelona so the location is excellent.  Overall, I look forward to going back in the warmer weather but winter was really special!  Very Festive!!!",5,2024,01,02
29,Wonderful Christmas time at Palace ,"We would like to thank to the Customer Service (who helps us to prepare a wonderful surprise)  and  the staff of the Ball Room where we celebrated Christmas Eve dinner and my husband's birthday. It was amazing how the whole room, without knowing anything, began to sing Happy Birthday at the desserts. Elegant music, gorgeous and sophisticated room  but, at the same time, familiar and cozy stay. Also, I would like to highlight the wonderful atmosphere at the Roof where we found to be in Switzerland, but staying in Barcelona. Cinema outside in a pretty recreation of a Swiss area and dinner in a Swiss Xalet.  Simply, the most glittering and tale's place where to be. 
Again, many thanks for these wonderful moments.",5,2024,01,02
29,Christmas Afternoon Tea: unforgettable experience,"Some friends had told us very well about all the things that El Palace Hotel organises for Christmas, so we went with our children to try the Christmas Afternoon Tea and I must say that it was absolutely exquisite and there was a lovely atmosphere, very cosy and familiar.
The children were very excited to give their letter to Santa who received it with great love, patience and lots of sweets!
It is an absolutely unforgettable experience and we have decided to make it a tradition every year because it is so worthwhile!",5,2024,01,02
29,"Christmas afternooon tea, a magical experience","We spent a wonderful afternoon with the family having Xmas Afternoon tea in an idyllic and peaceful setting. The piano in the background transported us to another era, the service and friendliness of the staff were excellent. The scones with clotted cream and jams were outstanding. We chose a red fruit tea which was delicious. And the children were thrilled when they were brought a little plate with chocolate Christmas cookies, a great detail from the hotel. And the nicest thing for them was to be able to deliver the letter to Santa Claus! An incredible experience that you definitely have to live it!

29,AMAZING Experience at Chalet by El Palace Hotel. ,"Incredible experience in the chalet is traveling to Switzerland, the decoration and attention was incredible. The sausage board and the cheese fondue were amazing. a recommendation to take into account on winter planes.",5,2024,01,02
29,Real experience,"We are delighted with the service of this hotel.

To start, the decoration of the hotel is incredible. You feel like inside a movie.

The art on the walls, the hallways and the smell make this establishment a unique place in the city.

The best thing about the hotel is its staff and the work they do. The guys at the concierge are super polite and at reception, Sergi, was a true host and was very close to us throughout our stay. We are very grateful.

We will be back very soon!",5,2024,01,01
29,Beautiful hotel in an excellent location with exceptional service.,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location, close to the Paseo del Prado but far enough away to be quiet. The staff at all levels is exceptional. The breakfasts were delicious. One of the bar waiters was quite very upset when we gave up waiting for the bill which we requested several times over 30 minutes. Sunday buffet lunch was amazing as we were entertained by tow excellent opera singers. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2023,12,30
29,Above and Beyond Staff Assistance,"The hotel has tremendous charm and the attention of the staff is above and beyond expectations.  My wife tripped over a bicycle / traffic lane divider in the street next to the hotel and hit her head on a curb.  The hotel's staff administered first aid, called an ambulance and made sure she was taken care of.  After a brief visit to the hospital and a rest back at the hotel, we continued our visit to Barcelona.  The hotel staff was very helpful and made a tough situation much better.  Kudos to them.",5,2023,12,27
29,"Best location, Best Service","One of the best experiences we have visiting Barcelona during Christmas, the had the best tea party with Santa, awesome quality Christmas dinner and even Santa left a little stocking full of gifts for my daughter, very good location to walk around Barcelona streets. Professional staff and super friendly, highly recommend this outstanding hotel if you are coming to Barcelona",5,2023,12,27
29,Wonderful Hotel,"I wish I could take El Palace and its friendly, attentive, helpful staff on vacations with me all around the world. It is a wonderful place to stay. The concierge staff is great, especially Idalla and Cristhen, with whom I most interacted. The excellent grand piano in the lobby is kept locked and guests are not allowed to play on it. However, it was unlocked for me each day. The staff as well as the other guests were very supportive of my playing. It doubles my pleasure in the pieces when others are absorbed in them, as well. I received a new nickname, Mr. Beethoven. Many of the other guests approached me because of my playing. I got to know much of and was very impressed with the El Palace cliental, in general. The breakfast bar has an ample selection of foods, from most healthy to least healthy. I like to eat on the healthy side, and I made a delicious tossed salad with the ingredients. The cut fresh fruits were also wonderful. The bed and bath linens are outstanding. My companion and I  dined at a different restaurant each of 7 nights. My favorite restaurants were Botafumeiro, Via Veneto, and Caelis, in that order. I wish we had dined at Botafumeiro three of the seven nights. We split a cod and raisin pie for an appetizer there, and it was exceptional. I had the best sangria I have ever had there (the Cava sangria). ",5,2023,12,19
29,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I love everything about this hotel! The Great Hall is gorgeous, the rooftop is incredible, the rooms are spacious, and the marble bathrooms are huge for an entry-level room. The highlight of our trip was dining at Amar, it's the most beautiful restaurant I've ever eaten in and serves some of the best seafood I've ever had.  If you have time I  recommend spending an evening enjoying the Christmas cinema and alpine chalet. The staff are also super friendly and helpful!",5,2023,12,11
29,El Palace Barcelona - a wonderful festive weekend ,"I had a wonderful stay at El Palace Barcelona! I visited the hotel in the summer before and loved the rooftop terrace, and fell in love with the Christmas activities all throughout the hotel, in particular the Christmas Cinema on the rooftop. The beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and everyone visiting and living in Barcelona should experience Amar Barcelona, the hotel's fantastic restaurant. It was another highlight of our trip! Thank you very much to the whole El Palace Barcelona team for a wonderful festive visit!",5,2023,12,11
29,"Excellent Hotel, with Excellent staff !","I just had a wonderful and relaxing stay at the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona ! I stayed there together with my mother, for 4 nights and we had a memorable and unforgettable time in Barcelona, from the beginning to the end. 

The El Palace Hotel is just in one word Excellent, with great care for the guests. The professional staff is excellent and they make you feel at home. I noticed that the Hotel has a sharp eye for the smallest details, from the warm welcome by the doorman at the entrance of the Hotel, and the professional Frontoffice, to the elegant decorations, and the gorgeous fragrance when you enter the Hotel, a realy joyful experience ! 

A special word of thanks for the excellent staff of the Hall restaurant, where we had our delicious Afternoon tea and tasteful dinners, with great live piano music ! The same goes for the wonderful staff of the El Jardín restaurant, where we had our wonderful breakfast, with fresh ingredients. The manager of El Jardín, Jordi, was so attentive and enthusiastic, he took the time to make us feel at home and even explained us about the interesting and unique history of Catalonia, so interesting ! 

Also the Roomservice Attendant we had on Monday evening was fabulous, and he met all the dinner wishes we had. The entire staff of the Hotel is warm, professional and passionate about their work, which gives you the joy to be there as a guest and to share in their enthousiasm !

We will definitely come back, and will then plan to visit the AMAR restaurant and the Rooftop Bar ! 

Finally, if there is one point for improvement to mention, then that will be the need for renovating and refurbishing the bathrooms in the Hotel, this will make the Hotel experience for the guests complete ! I already read somewhere in the comments to the reviews, that arrangements have already been made, to soon start the renovations of the bathrooms in the Hotel. That would be great, and will further enhance the overall experience of the guests in your Hotel ! Keep up the good work !",5,2023,12,09
29,Top notch!,"We had a wonderful stay here I didn’t want to leave. The hotel was very well-staffed and everyone was super nice, helpful, and accommodating - especially the doormen! The bar area is really nice, great aesthetic and vibe and they often had a live pianist in the evenings which was a really nice touch. The location can’t be beat, it’s close to great shopping and restaurants and walkable to some sights but close enough to the metro for others that are farther. Turn down service was also great!!! Just felt so chic at this hotel!",5,2023,12,01
29," Over the top in excellence!","El Palace is hands down my favorite hotel experience ever. Check in/out was a breeze due to the friendly and helpful staff. Kristian at the concierge took great care of us when we had questions or needed assistance and directions. We loved the opulence of the hotel and the beautifully appointed, comfortable rooms. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and we made sure to visit the hotel bar before dinner each night. Our bartender, Fabio, gave so much personality to the bar and we enjoyed his recommendations. Housekeeping went above and beyond as well. I would not think twice about staying at El Palace again. The staff and hotel exceeded our expectation.",5,2023,11,29
29,Barcelona visit,Great hotel!  Staff was over the top accommodating.  Facilities were great.  We traveled with our college aged daughter and had a suite with two rooms and 1 1/2 bathrooms.  Was ideal for us.  Bars are great in hotel.  Location and ease of taxi were awesome.,5,2023,11,26
29,True delight.,"Let’s begin with the location. It is ideal. Near “OldTown” and all the energy that includes. Shopping along Passeig De Gràcia is nearby. Família Sagrada is a short cab ride or 20 minute walk. 

The hotel is a classic that has gone upscale renovation with luxuries unexpected in this price range. Bedding and baths are first rate

The staff is welcoming and super helpful. Felt like home after one day. 

Very highly recommended.",5,2023,11,19
29,Beautiful Hotel with Impeccable service,"Beautiful hotel located centrally to everything in Barcelona and the service was Amazing!  From the moment we checked in, the service was friendly and impeccable!   Everyone from the doorman, restaurant service, housekeeping, concierge were all superb!

29,"Great hotel, great staff, great location.","This is one of the warmest, friendliest, very nice upscale, hotels in which we have stayed. The location is excellent. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. They are quick to assist with special requests, and we always felt that they were happy to see us. The food in the restaurants was excellent, and the restaurant staff was superb. Surprisingly, the cost of the hotel restaurants was very reasonable. We stayed in a suite, which was very roomy, elegant and comfortable. The Wi-Fi worked well, and the shower was great! The concierge staff was very helpful and knowledgeable with everything we needed, from planning our days to finding out of the way gems to visit.",5,2023,10,20
29,Highly Recommend a stay at the EL Palace!,"From the moment we arrived at the El Palace, we knew we had made the right choice of hotel for our 3 night stay in Barcelona!!  Very warm welcome, staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel is very grand with a lovely ambience. 
Our room was very spacious, comfortable and had a great bathroom. We were lucky with the weather and spent most of our time at the hotel roof top restaurant/bar/swimming pool area. We had dinner there the whole 3 nights of our stay. The food was delicious with a good choice on the menu and once again the staff are so friendly and efficient. We went to the Blues Bar situated in the hotel on the Thursday night, it's an absolute must!! We can't tell you how fantastic it is!! The live music was out of this world!!  We loved it!!
We'd definitely stay at the El Palace when visiting Barcelona again. Highly Recommend!!",5,2023,10,19

29,Memorable!,"The level of service was exceptional and accommodations outstanding. Room was cleaned while we were out during day and while we had dinner, our room was turned down. We had dinner at the Rooftop Garden terrace and food and service was exceptional. Also, the location of the hotel was central to many of the places you would want to visit in Barcelona.

We liked the luxury on the design and the quality of the facilities. Also we wanted highlight the cleaningless of all the common areas and specially in our room.

The service was perfect, but we wanted to highlight the work from Sergi on FO who went beyond and made us a really special welcome on the first day and was really kind in all the interactions we had with him.

If we come back to BCN we will return here. Thank you so much ladies and gentleman.",5,2023,10,06
29,El Palace does everything great!,"Classically beautiful hotel, located on the Gran Via, great location with close proximity to the upscale shopping district and within walking distance of most of Barcelona’s main attractions. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by the very professional staff and surrounded by classic art deco elegance. Our Superior King with a city view room was spacious, featuring a double sink bathroom with both tub and shower. The breakfast buffet was delicious, served in a beautiful setting where you could choose either inside or outside. Make sure to have a cocktail at the stunning bar.  A cocktail on the rooftop bar is a must, with gorgeous city views. By far, our favorite hotel during our 15 day visit to Spain.",5,2023,10,03

Room amenities were very good
I  have been to a few five staff plus hotels and this is among them they made sure our taxi driver knew where to take us they were really great",5,2023,10,01
29,Spoil Yourself in Barcelona,"This is the second time I have stayed at this amazing hotel. The first time was with my 2 daughters and I loved bringing my husband this time to experience this special place together. From the moment you step in, you enter such an incredible atmosphere. You know you are somewhere very special but the welcome is warm and feels so personal. The rooms are so carefully prepared with everything you could think of and more. The beds are super comfortable with linen that you never want to leave. The rooftop provides Barcelona views as far as the eye can see with a bar and restaurant that offers excellent service and delicious foods and cocktails. Breakfast provides a vast array of goodies in a beautiful setting with impeccable service. The price you pay may be more than you would normally but if you are looking to be spoiled - this is the place to be. Close to everything and in such a gorgeous part of the city. I don't know if I will be lucky enough to go back to Spain anytime soon but if I did - I would love to stay there again. Such an absolute treat.",5,2023,09,25
29,Weekend escape from NYC,Amazing hotel with personal staff great decor rooftop restaurant. Very clean quiet elegance atmosphere. I would more utilize grand piano for evening ambiance. Rooftop restaurant was the only I use. Ambiance there definitely needs new design that beautiful view can be seen. Also swimming pool is isolated from sitting area which could be incorporated that would add value to atmosphere,5,2023,09,24
29,Recommended for a stay in Barcelona!,"We had a very enjoyable stay recently, and thoroughly recommend this hotel especially as it’s located very centrally and gives easy access to a lot of what Barcelona has to offer. All staff were highly professional, efficient and friendly at all times. The rooftop bar has great views over the city and has a wonderful ambience. The lobby bar was also really pleasant for a post dinner drink. We didn’t use the restaurant, but had breakfast each morning. The breakfast choices were very varied and delicious.

The room was very comfortable and extremely quiet especially as it looked out onto one of Barcelona’s main thoroughfares, the Gran Via des les Corts Catalanes. The bed was really comfortable. There were nice touches in the room including a travel adapter, plus an umbrella that was very handy as we had one afternoon of torrential rain. Please note, if you want a Nespresso machine, they’re complimentary but you need to ask housekeeping to bring one to the room. 

We were travelling with friends and our request to have rooms close by was accommodated (we had adjacent rooms). The concierge was extremely helpful with great recommendations for restaurants to visit including a really good Argentinian restaurant, and a great tapas bar that was a 2 block walk. The checkin and checkout process was efficient and the whole lobby team were very welcoming and professional. I saw the concierges handle a ‘difficult’ guest and they were very courteous and respectful in handling that situation.

29,Old World Charm and Service,"Loved everything about our stay, enjoyed an experience like it used to be in the luxury hotels of the past and hard to find in this day and age.

29,Beautiful Place in the center of Barcelona,"A very clean, manicured hotel. Friendly stuff. We stayed in junior suite. The room was quiet with a beautiful walk in closet. The downstairs restaurant is a gem. The service was impeccable.  
We enjoyed the roof top bar, as well as downstairs bar with amazing drinks. The food served downstairs was a work of art. The hotel has a long history, the decor and maintenance are both at par with the best hotels in the world. ",5,2023,09,16
29,Luxury Hotel in Barcelona,"We checked out of the El Palace this morning after a 3 day stay.  We were celebrating our anniversary.  The hotel was wonderful.  Our room was spacious and well decorated.  The hotel is gorgeous.  Classic.  Beautifully decorated.  The location is perfect.  Walking distance to so many attractions.  What makes this hotel really shine is the staff.  They cannot do enough for you.  Everyone is helpful and friendly.  We first met Javier the minute we stepped out of our taxi in front of the hotel.  He was friendly and helpful during our stay.  We looked forward to seeing him each morning.

29,The best in Barcelona!,"We had an amazing stay at The Palace Hotel! The property, the rooms, and the staff were all exceptional!!! You also can't beat the location...close and walkable to all the main attractions. They also have a Michelin Star restaurant on the property that we didn't have a chance to experience, but we can't wait to go back!",5,2023,09,13
29,A simply amazing hotel in central Barcelona,"We have just checked out of this fabulous hotel and it was simply amazing! The staff throughout the hotel are  friendly and helpful, from the receptionists, to the concierge team to the breakfast staff, all of them can’t do enough for you. . Our room was spacious and very quiet for a city centre hotel. As it was my partners birthday they organised a birthday cake & bottle of bubbly - such a nice gesture. The bar next door, Obama was great for a late night drink & live music, fab atmosphere.",5,2023,09,12
29,Overrated Luxury with no Depth,"Location was perfect and the concierge/doormen were extremely helpful. Unfortunately, the positives ended there. The drain in the shower was broken and kept coming lose, one of the sink drains didn’t work, toilet flush button kept getting stuck, no convenient outlets to charge phones/computer etc.

The lobby and communal spaces had a nice luxury aesthetic, but there was no depth to any of marketed “class”. For $600+ per night, no breakfast included and they limit you to one water per person. The spa has all these rave reviews, but it’s a few small massage rooms with a sauna that doesn’t get hot enough. The food and drinks are overpriced, no reason to eat at the hotel when you can get a better meal for 1/3 of the price 3-4 blocks down the street.

The rooftop patio is cool, but the pool is small, and nobody is staffed to order drinks/food.

I don’t plan to go back to Barcelona, but if I do I won’t be staying here",3,2023,09,10
29,Wonderful hotel in the center of Barcelona.,"El Palace is the former Ritz in Barcelona.  It has lost none of its famed service and beauty.  As soon as you enter, her magnificence shines through.  A beautiful high ceiling lobby greets you.  The service is impeccable, the breakfast is very nice and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  There is a small rooftop pool and garden which gives a great view and we the city.  There is no better place to stay in Barcelona.  If you are planning meetings, Tiffany is extremely helpful in the sales group.  ",5,2023,09,09
29,Great staff and accommodations.,"This is my second stay at El Palace hotel.  The accommodations, staff and food are always excellent. Very kind and gracious staff, always willing to help you.  The accommodations are beautiful and very comfortable. The food is excellent, especially the breakfast buffet. I love it there.",5,2023,09,05

29,Grandeur in the heart of Barcelona,"We had a junior suite at El Palace for four nights in April.  Having stayed at other 5 star hotels in Barcelona and been disappointed, I decided to give El Palace a whirl as one of the oldest grand hotels in the City.  It did not disappoint.

The service at El Palace is extremely good.  Check in was quick and easy and the staff were polite, helpful and efficient.

The public areas in the hotel are stunning.  The bar area and rooms around it, and the covered courtyard for breakfast are tremendous spaces.  The roof top area is lovely, with some fantastic views and the bar area is great.  The pool is on the small side but being rooftop, there is limited space.

Our room was great, spacious and opulent.  There was a huge bathroom, with enormous shower area, separate wc, two wash basins and a jacuzzi bath.  We also had a seperate dressing room area.

Breakfast is extremely good, with a wide variety of choices and great staff.  The breakfast area can be busy, but staff turn tables around quickly and we rarely had to wait any more than a minute of two for a table to be prepared.

El Palace is in a great spot- centrally located and within walking distance to Placa de Catalunya and the Gothic Quarter.  There is also a constant stream of taxis to the hotel.

I would recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit Barcelona.

Top tip- if you want to do any of the main Gaudi buildings you need to book in advance.

Special mention- try Patagonia Beef and Wine across the road from the hotel- those guys know ho to do steak.",5,2023,09,01
29,Nice and charming hotel,"Very nice and charming hotel, with friendly and helpful hotel staff. Location was perfectly located in a relatively quiet area, and near to everything, One area for improvement would be the air conditioning - would be perfect if it could be cooler.  ",4,2023,08,31
29,Fantastic Barcelona stay at El Palace ,"Nice hotel located in very good area of Barcelona and not far from many cultural visits. El Palace staff is very helpful. The Rooftop is well arranged with nice view to the city.

29,Outstanding hotel and staff ,"What can I say about this hotel other than it is outstanding. From the minute we arrived to our check out the service was excellent, every member of staff that we met were attentive, courteous and friendly and made you feel welcome. 
The facilities are brilliant with a rooftop bar and pool. We also had the 'cake and bubbles ' experience which was made special by the gentleman (sorry I didn't get his name) who recommended a wonderful sweet that wasn't on the menu but he took the time to source it for me. I
would also recommend the restaurant, Amar Barcelona as the food is amazing. 
It is certainly a five star hotel with five star service, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2023,08,13
29,Highest recommendation ,"If you’re in Barcelona stay here. Top notch service, wonderful people, good food, excellent location, beautiful accommodations, and an all-around positive atmosphere. I give it my highest recommendation. ",5,2023,08,09
29,El Horrible...,"I first read about El Palace in Conde Nast Traveller’s Gold list, as one of the editors’ All-Time Favourite Hotels. I had had wonderful stays at other hotels on this list, so when planning our holiday in Spain in July, I booked El Palace thinking we would end our trip with a splurge. What a disappointment! I don’t think the editors have stayed there recently. In the city of Gaudi, El Palace just seemed like a gaudy Marriott Courtyard. All that El Palace has in common with a palace is that it’s old and falling apart. In our ‘Classic’ room, we had stains on the carpet, stains and broken bathroom tiles, and dead flowers in the window box. The rooftop courtyard was tired and old, with a tiny pool, and an unimpressive view. The breakfast garden? Peeling paint, heat lamps everywhere (in July) and a tent set up with hundreds of coffee cups. All for the low, low price of €500/night. This was hardly the pampering, elegant, charming experience proclaimed on the website. I feel cheated, lied to, and upset that we ended our holiday by staying there. Please don’t make the same mistake I did.",2,2023,08,04
29,Get Royal Treatment at the Hotel El Palace,"We stayed at the Hotel El Palace during a recent trip to Barcelona.  From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and pampered.  The front desk and bellhop attendants were incredibly friendly; the room was luxurious and well-appointed; and the concierge was thoughtful and helpful.  Don't miss a meal at the rooftop restaurant for an amazing view and experience.  Visiting the Hotel El Palace is an incredible experience and one you will never forget.",5,2023,07,24

29,A Timeless Gem with Exceptional Service - Hotel EL Palace Barcelona,"I visited Barcelona for the first time with my Daughter .
Our stay at Hotel EL Palace in Barcelona was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment We stepped foot into this elegant establishment, We were transported to a world of timeless charm and unmatched luxury. Every aspect of our experience, from the stunning architecture to the impeccable service, exceeded my expectations.
First and foremost, the hotel's ambiance is truly captivating. Housed in a beautifully restored 19th-century building, Hotel EL Palace effortlessly blends classic elegance with modern amenities. The grandeur of the architecture, with its intricate details and opulent furnishings, evokes a sense of history and sophistication. It truly felt like stepping into a bygone era while still enjoying the comforts of the present.
The highlight of our stay, however, was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. From the warm welcome at check-in to the personalized attention throughout our entire stay, the staff at Hotel EL Palace went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Their attention to detail and genuine desire to make my experience memorable was truly commendable. Whether it was arranging transportation, offering expert recommendations on local attractions, or simply ensuring my room was always sparkling clean, every interaction with the staff was met with professionalism and warmth. The breakfast was very good with friendly staff who made us feel very welcome. We had only two  minor issues : Not enough light in the bedroom , and a failed design of the curtains which makes it difficult to open the windows to the fullest. 
 ",5,2023,07,09
29,A fabulous stay - thank you!,"We have just returned from our second visit to the Palace - a five day stay at the hotel and it was fabulous. The suite we were allocated was gorgeous, with a super jacuzzi bath. The breakfast was fantastic - so much choice and the service was great.

The hotel is a wonderful base to explore Barcelona and the concierge and door staff are really helpful with any advice you need.

The rooftop bar is beautiful and the pop was a welcome area to relax after exploring the city.

The blues man bar was sadly closed during our stay, however we enjoyed a nightcap every evening in the lobby bar. Special thanks go to Fabio, the bartender who served us delicious drinks with highlights about the hotel and its history. He was so kind.

Thanks to all the team for a wonderful stay and we sincerely hope to see you again very soon. Victoria x",5,2023,07,07
29,Great spot with nice rooftop area,"Great spot for touring Barcelona. We stayed for 6 nights with our family of five. Spent relaxing time and used the facilities (rooftop pool and restaurant) a lot as we have been to Barcelona before and this time did not go to so many local attractions. Great service, and we really liked the rooftop area. Rooms were nice and a big plus to us was possibility to get a connecting room. ",5,2023,07,06
29,One of the finest hotels,"We stayed in EL Palace for two nights. We are a family of three and we’re travelling with our toddler. We were greeted well at the reception.  Infact, most of the staff members at the reception and concierge are very warm and helpful. Although there was no view from our Junior suite but the room was well equipped and nicely decorated. After enquiry, we came to know that none of the Junior suites in the hotel have a city view as they are situated on first floor. The breakfast area was large and staff members there also are cordial. Perhaps, they may add some more variety in the breakfast. We expected a lot from the hotel and we were mostly satisfied with the service and atmosphere at the hotel. The big plus is that the location of the hotel is perfect with the main shopping street just five minutes away. We are glad that we included Barcelona as one of the destinations to visit in Europe. It is just surreal and wonderful. We plan to come back after a few years. Kudos to EL Palace team. Thanks for your efficient service. 
P.S. On the day we checked in, the gentleman at the hotel reception suggested that he will provide us with birthday surprise for our daughter on the next day. To our surprise, nothing was done in this regard. Not that we wanted anything but still they forgot. Just that such a grand hotel missed sending anything for the celebration. Otherwise it was a comfortable stay.",5,2023,07,06
29,Old Europe charm.,"An old style European palace hotel. 
It's not trendy. It's not edgy. It's just pure old world charm with every modern convenience. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet. The staff is extremely friendly and discreet. The concierge team is top-notch. In the weeks prior to our arrival they helped us arrange museum tickets and restaurant reservations. We were not disappointed by any of their recommendations. 
The basement has a wonderful bar with live music that takes you back to a different era. The roof-top has a pool, a bar and a view that of Barcelona that takes your breath away. ",5,2023,07,02

29,If you're looking for a wonderful upscale experience this is the hotel for you.,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels you will ever visit.  The attention to detail is amazing.  It is perfectly located, near shops and restaurants.  The rooms are well furnished and comfortable.  But the best part of this facility is the people who work there.  Everyone is extremely helpful and cordial.  It's almost impossible to single out the one person who was most helpful because that would deminish the efforts of the rest of this wonderful staff.  We could not have asked for a more pleasant stay.",5,2023,06,29
29,Top notch,"I can't express fully just how fantastic staying here is. Beautiful historic hotel that honors its past everyday. Beyond accomodating staff, courteous and they never forget those small touches. We have stayed here twice and will again. ",5,2023,06,26

hotel.
But what sets it above all, is the incredible staff who cater to your every need.
From the welcoming door man and bell personal to the great Bar tenders Fabio and Sandi.
But a true grand hotel also rests on the shoulders of the Concierge who can open any door and make a
stay truly memorable, (Thank you Francisco)!
I'd give it 6 stars if I could!",5,2023,06,15
29,Our first visit to Barcelona and Spain,"The hotel was really beautiful and loved the foyer, bar, breakfast room.  The staff were exceptionally warm and helpful.  I could not find any fault at all.  I would recommend to all to experience the stay in the hotel even though it is not cheap.  Thank you all for making our stay wonderful.  ",5,2023,06,15
29,The Wonderful Ritz ,"We spent 3 nights at El Palace and it doesn’t disappoint. Would recommend 100%, the staff are amazing and the historic building and features are all well maintained.
The rooftop area with its restaurant, pool and lounging area provided 360 views of Barcelona and has plenty of shade.
The lobby has an amazing foyer area, with a pianist and a featured bar, a fantastic place to chill after a day sightseeing. The location was perfect, just a 5 min walk to The Gothic area.
We had a classic room, which had a nice feel to it, spacious and light.
Overall we had a relaxing time, the staff really made it a 5 star experience.",5,2023,06,12

29,Excellent hotel ,"I stayed here for a few nights after a week on Mallorca.   The hotel was excellent in every way.   I would say the highlight is the staff…from the concierge to the doormen to the housekeepers every single person at this hotel was extremely gracious and helpful.  The sheets are wonderful and the beds very comfortable.   The breakfast buffet was over the top and our dinner on the rooftop was spectacular.  The next time I come to Barcelona I will absolutely stay here.   We had an early check out at 3:30 am and it went seamlessly.  Our taxi was there waiting for us, and reception had our bills prepared in advance.  ",5,2023,05,25
29,Amazing Again,"Once again El Palace delights us!  This hotel never wains.  It is timeless elegance, in a perfect setting and location.  We just had a classic lead in room this time - but what a room and layout!  It’s just my husband and myself, but this room could be proper for a couple and child or teen.  A sitting area with separate TV with a door separates a king size bedroom with a LARGE bath.  The water closest is nicely placed beside the sitting area.  Very much appreciated even for a couple who’ve been married long, but still longs for   bathroom privacy.  Great use of space.  
Everything in the room is thoughtfully prepared for a guest.  Right down to the electric adapter- no need to ask !  And the blow dryer was the bomb !  Black mambo and it did the trick !  
We been here many times, and I tell you this hotel not only keeps up the property (I couldn’t find one fault- no chipped paint, no rug stains, nothing).  
The people who work here are equally amazing.  And that Breakfast !  OMG !  
From a World Traveler for 30 plus years. You can’t get any better.   And the history book in the room, you should take 20 minutes to read !",5,2023,05,19
29,Amazing stay,"Everything was perfect, I recommend this hotel for everyone, we had a great time , the staff were so friendly and great and the room was clean, big and comfortable, thanks for the complimentary cookies and the juice for my kids. The rooftop was amazing. The view was great , we had fun",5,2023,05,18
29,Beautiful hotel but service standard was disappointing,"We stayed 7 nights in this historic hotel and celebrated a special occasion during our trip. 

The hotel is truly beautiful & elegantly decorated, however the service levels were inconsistent and sorely disappointing for a hotel of this standard & price. Also, there was unfortunately no special factor that made this hotel memorable. 

Rooms -  we booked a classic double room for 3 people & got upgraded to a deluxe room on a high floor. While I appreciated the upgrade and the room decor was beautiful, the bathroom (while spacious) was in visible need of refurbishment. The paint was badly peeling in certain parts, the closet doorknob came off on our third day, the glass shower door wouldn't close fully so the bathroom got wet during a shower. I'm not expecting a newly renovated room but for the price, the room should at least be in good working condition. 

Housekeeping - was very inconsistent and there was a severe lack of attention to detail. Some examples:
- Upon check in, the room curtain was unhooked from the first hook and messily hanging - it took 3 days for housekeeping to finally notice & fix this. 
- For the entirety of our stay, all room amenities were provided for 2 (not 3) people despite us having booked & paid for 3 people. 
- Used wine glasses & water mugs were not washed for several days until we called housekeeping to do so. 
- On several days, I came back to my luggage having been moved haphazardly (I think they were trying to make up the extra bed) and not put back in its place. 
- Turn down service was done beautifully on some days and not at all on other days. 

Rooftop terrace - was a gorgeous place to dine, food was excellent and the service was lovely. We felt very welcome here and it was a real treat dining here! Definitely try the rooftop terrace at least once!

Front desk, concierge and bellman were excellent. The concierge was helpful with dining recommendations and guest relations gave us a cake for the special occasion we were celebrating. The bellman was attentive to get us taxis & always greeted us with a smile. 

Breakfast - is definitely worth a try! The breakfast room is beautiful and the drawing room leading to it is so regal & gorgeous. Generous spread of food & service was warm as well. 

Amar - dined here & paid over 400 euros but it was a shockingly disappointing experience. The bread, starters, petit fours & decor were wonderful -  but the 200 euros of seafood we ordered was not fresh at all and the service was disinterested & careless. We were abit shocked at how bad it was for a Michelin restaurant. 

Bluesman cocktail bar - did not try. There's a 50 euro per pax minimum spend but perhaps this could be waived for hotel guests who are already paying a lot for a room. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay but felt greatly let down by the service standards at this otherwise lovely hotel. Unfortunately, I highly doubt I'd return here again but sincerely hope the hotel improves its service standards to match its elegant & historic interiors.",4,2023,05,07
29,Definitely one of our favorite hotels….,"We loved our stay at El Palace Hotel Barcelona.  We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was very luxurious & had 2 separate bathrooms.  It’s conveniently located near La Rambla and walking distance to many shops.  We loved the breakfast buffet, one of the best, and restaurant staff were most friendly people we’ve seen.  The rooftop deck is very cozy for having drinks & appetizers.  There’s a small pool but we didn’t use it.  This was our first time visiting Barcelona and we loved it here, people in Spain are very welcoming & friendly, we definitely want to return and stay at this luxurious hotel.",5,2023,05,06
29,We Were Treated Like Royalty,"We had a wonderful stay at Hotel El Palace.  We booked a suite, it was large with a separate bedroom and nice sized living room.  Everything was clean and in excellent condition.  My husband found the mattress to be a little too firm.  This was taken care of immediately with a wonderful mattress topper.  Every request was met with ""as you wish"".
These were not empty words, they really meant it and followed through beautifully on every request we made.

Breakfast each morning was a delight.  Every staff member went above and beyond to be sure we were please and had everything we needed.  Food was excellent and the patio was so comfortable.  Heaters on or off, as you wish.  

Doormen were at the ready to get cabs or help with directions or make sure our Uber knew where we were going.  They were professional and friendly.

It was my birthday trip and they delivered candies, champagne and a nice leather luggage tag as a gift to our room.  

Housekeeping was perfect.  My husband asked one of the housekeepers for a few more hangers and she thought he said an ironing board.  We felt bad that she lugged it to our room, but she was anxious to please and we appreciated her efforts.

This is a lovely hotel which we enjoyed immensely.  I will review Amar separately.  It's not to be missed.  We highly recommend El Palace it was a fantastic stay.",5,2023,05,05
29,Great hotel!,"Great staff, extremely comfortable rooms and wonderful breakfast. The hotel is beautiful and has all of the modern updates yet maintains its stately décor. The concierge staff was very helpful in arranging transportation, dining as well as answering many questions about shipping items back to the USA.",5,2023,05,03
29,Simply The Best,"We are well-travelled, senior enought and we like to treat ourselves.. we can say that this is one of the best hotels we ever stayed. 
The room was spaciuos, confortable, very well equipped, elegant, silent, with a nice natural light and a perfect lighting. The bed super comfrotafle and linen very fine.
The bathroom is spacious, too, and the shower is very confrtable.
We had the opportunity to profit of almost all the food facilities of the hotel during our three days stay. The breakfast is simply wonderfull: wide veranda buffet where you can find everything (very good quality of everything!); the senior barman  of the Hall bar & restaurant made me one of the best Old Fashion cocktail I ever had. We also had lunch and dinner there: great food served by very kind and professional waitresses. In the night we joined the Blesman: wonderful live music, super elegant cosy room and Diana, the waitress, is very kind and professional and welcomed us as if we were special repeaters. ",5,2023,04,30
29,Unfortunately not the 5 *  experience we were expecting.,"On the surface El Palace is indeed Grand and beautiful. 
Our room was spacious and kept very clean during our stay. Thank you housekeeping. 
Breakfast was a great start to the day. Staff were happy and welcoming. Food was extensive and enjoyable. 
However, we totally agree with some of these negative comments posted in April.
I’m not about to list a load of negativity on Trip Advisor as we did bring our biggest grumbles to the attention of staff, but I will say that my husband and I had more than our fair share of questionable service over our 5 days holiday. From food quality to incorrect billing.
We also feel that more attention could be paid to resident guests needs rather than “Private Events” which take over residents space, particularly Rooftop and pool.",3,2023,04,29
29,A travel in time - for the good and for the bad,"El Palace is a very traditional luxury hotel in Barcelona. Glamour and ambience won't disappoint you, neither will kindness of the staff. It is very well kept, have absolutely no sign of decadence and you'll barely find something to remind you that you are in 2023 - for the good (all modernist decor look new), and for the bad (wifi is quite precarious, there was no minibar at out room, and neither there was a single available power outlet to charge our phones). 
The lobby bar is nice and pleasing, there is a lovely reading room on the back, and a very interesting speakeasy bar downstairs with great live music - apparently the only place in the city to which the concierge won't get you a reservation; not that the bar is all booked out but apparently said bar and concierge desk are not on speaking terms. 
Overall it is a good one-time experience but you'll likely find better options at more reasonable rates.",4,2023,04,27
29,Overall good hotel ,"Very good hotel professional stuff at reception and concierge

Surpiangly I had a  lunch at rooftop on the 7th floor the view is amazing.. I ordered a chicken césar salad where they presented a salad with cold and aged chicken I did ask to talk to FB manager to show him the quality of  chicken  he did come and send a waitress and didnt interact with me...its a pitty for high standard hotel to have such staff",4,2023,04,27
29,Excellent Staff and Centrally Located Hotel,"Staying here was an absolute pleasure. The room was spacious, and the bathroom was huge. Separate shower and jetted tub, double sinks, vanity mirror, separate room with toilet. Bottled water was replaced twice each day. Everyone from the front desk to concierge treated us with respect and were extremely helpful with questions and recommendations.  The hotel was centrally located for everything that we wanted to see, and it was very quiet. We frequented the rooftop bar and restaurant, and we enjoyed a quiet meal at the inside restaurant. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.",5,2023,04,23
29,Wonderful experience!,"Beautiful historic hotel with top notch staff. We were treated to a luxurious stay, our room and all amenities were top notch.  I wish all hotels were as perfectly wonderful!  Breakfast buffet was vast, and everything was fresh and delicious. The rooftop terrace had a great view of the city and a nice selection of tapas and wines.  ",5,2023,04,21
29,Not the Grand Hotel Experience Expected,"We are just back from a 5 night stay at El Palace Barcelona. We put a great deal of intention into our itinerary and chose this property based on many of the reviews here, as well as its affiliation with the Leading Hotels of the World. We were celebrating a milestone anniversary, had not travelled much lately due to the pandemic, and were seeking an old world experience, with refined service in a luxury property. Unfortunately, El Palace was NOT the place for such an experience. The reviews simply did not add up.  While the physical property appears quite opulent upon arrival (and the lobby is quite grand), we found the rooms tired and small, and a property which largely caters to extended families with poorly behaved children running about and adults mindlessly staring at screens while propping their dirty sneakers up on the furnishings.

For the most part, the staff was very attentive and gracious - with the exception of the extremely unprofessional lobby cafe maitre'd. This gentleman was not only rude to hotel guests, but also to his colleagues - one of which was a lovely student/apprentice from Holland. Not okay to be so dismissive of others! His behavior caused us to avoid what might have been a lovely area of the hotel for the duration of our stay. Another shortfall with the staff was the concierge department. One of the reasons one stays at a grand old world property such as this is for the concierge's knowledge of the city. Sadly, this team fell short resulting in endless hours wandering the city (and Trip Advisor) for authentic (non-tourist) dining experiences. Extremely frustrating. We wasted so much time and energy on disappointing dining!

A highlight of the property is the blues bar which offers some fabulous live music performances during the weekends. Unfortunately, this experience was also compromised thanks to a group/party of an intoxicated 8-10 individuals with ZERO attention span or appreciation for the talented musicians performing. The staff could have elected not to seat them at 10 PM, and to continue serving them as they arrived completely intoxicated? Again, just not the crowd we would have expected in a property that pitches itself as ""distinguished"". 

One last point I wanted to share with anyone considering a stay at this property. If you are at all cautious about germs and such, you may want to look elsewhere. Each morning the hotel offers a ""free"" breakfast buffet. A super spreader scenario with children touching everything from common utensils to food - and then putting it back in some cases. So unsettling. Tables filled with large families right on top of one another, no gloves provided for the serving utensils, zero policing of any of this bad behavior. Have we learned nothing? 

While we managed to enjoy the city of Barcelona itself, we were SO disappointed with Leading Hotels of the World and the pivot they have made to ""groupon"" pricing and clientele. They once were a reliable brand of high standards that delivered exceptional hotel experiences. Not the case based on this experience -- and also that of our stay at Palacio de Los Duques in Madrid. A couple of years ago we found a lovely chain of hotels in Europe - Rocco Forte I believe, On all fronts, they truly cater to guests seeking an elevated and refined European hotel experience. We were unable to locate any of their properties for our Spain visit. Leading Hotels of the World (and El Palace Barcelona) would do well to take a cue from their mastery of the guest experience.

29,Living upto the LHW image,"Exceptional service & hospitality. Breakfast spread is great. 
We took a family room as we were a family of four. And it was more than spacious for us. 
We checked in very late past midnight and the check in was smooth. 
We needed Covid tests for our kids as a pre requisite to board the cruise and it was promptly arranged in our room.",5,2023,04,17

29,Memorable El Palace,"The El Palace has a great location and a storied history!  The hotel has been carefully restored!  It is eye catching and lovingly cared for. The room is spacious and furnished grandly!  The staff go out of their way to make your stay special, from the doorman, to reception, to the restaurant staff, to the concierge!  We almost starting crying when we left because they made our stay so enjoyable!  We would love to return someday!  The El Palace is a gem!",5,2023,04,12
29,Afternoon Tea at El Palace Barcelona,"We stayed at a different hotel, but we came here for the tea experience in the main dining/bar area of El Palace. I booked everything in advance and got the vouchers.  Contacted the them via email, there were a few attempts and finally we got confirmed.  When we finally arrived it seems there was confusion on the time.  They had 2 different reservations, not sure how as I have everything in writing, nothing was resceduled but somehow it showed funky stuff on their side.  FYI, they did ask for the physical printed vouchers, which thank god we had. Anyways.  We got seated, everything was pleasant.  We came right after opening (around 16:00) and it was almost empty, which we enjoyed.  There was a live piano and no one rushed us out at all.  Food was delicious and plenty of it.  Would definitely comeback.  The decor is nice as well.
PS. No issues communicating in English as some other reviews mentioned concerns.",5,2023,04,11
29,Family Stay In The Best Location in Barcelona!,"The hotel was phenomenal from start to finish, the food fantastic, hospitality was stellar, and Tiffany Alejandrino in Sales did everything possible to make our family stay special and memorable. Thank you to the team, we will definitely be returning and recommending the hotel to anyone we know is visiting Barcelona. ",5,2023,04,09
29,5 ***** GL,We stayed in a suite which was spacious enough for a family of 4 with children in the age of 10 and 15. Enjoy a lunch on the rooftop of the hotel. The breakfast was really good. The staff very professional and great. Car was parked by the staff. Whenever we visit Barcelona again.. WE’LL BE BACK 😀😉,5,2023,04,07

29,A wonderful hotel,"One of the nicest most comfortable hotels I have stayed in. The staff are truly outstanding, wonderfully attentive and professional. 

We booked two rooms interconnecting, magnificent bathrooms with incredible rain showers. The beds were amazing, everyone commented on the confit, the pillows and bedding. 

The whole hotel is immaculate, and extremely well managed. The roof garden is a delight with stunning views of the city

We will be back",5,2023,03,30
29,"With the best experience and I salute Ms Amal Naimi , who she made all the efforts to make us feel home away from home.","Enjoyed our stay with super excellent facilities of the hotel ,best locations of Barcelona, walking distance to almost most of the attractions 
We appreciated the very friendly hotel staff, specially the Guest Relation Dept (Ms Amal Naimi)",5,2023,03,27
29,El Palace  Still Grand in Barcelona,"Of the the many ""Grand Hotels"" around the world I've been to, this is certainly one of the grandest. From the old world opulence to service Mr. Ritz would be proud of , this hotel stands out from the rest. If you want more than steel and glass facades totally devoid of personality, you might want to consider this grand hotel. See photos.
Located on a great avenue in a central location in Barcelona, it was easy walking distance to the Palau de Musica or the the old Gothic quarters.  Easy to catch a taxi to or Cabify to La Sagrada Familia or Park Gruell( 8 euros).

Built as the Ritz Barcelona in 1919. Believe it or not it still has that grand feel to it.  The lobby  with iron grill work exhibiting the ""R"" 's for Ritz hotel are still there. The long walk through the Great Hall room past the grand piano with an accomplished classical pianist playing was just marvelous.  No modern pseudo music here.  
Attentive ,accomplished service. People truly glad to be serving you. Most had been there many years.  Ate in the Hall Restaurant every night. The lamb and steak were very good. The food and service was always exceptional.   The buffet breakfast in the another room with  a outdoor patio style feel to it was very nice.  Service and food also exceptional. 

If you want to be taken back to to a different time and place when life was grand, stay at the El Palace Barcelona!

29,"Classic elegance and charm, but feeling lost","Loves the family suite- 3 adjoining rooms like an apartment is the reason we booked this hotel. For the price, the rooms were spectacular. We loved the luxurious bedding and perfect service. 
Nice touches like departing gifts and welcome champagne and snacks to celebrate a milestone birthday. Thoughtful service and attention to detail is important. 
We thought the location was fine. We all hated the old carpets and color scheme which included patterns that seemed to compete with one another. It’s a throw-back to a bygone era, but in a way that feels confusing. Breakfast was huge and in an interesting room. 
The rooftop bar was strange- the pool area & restaurant always had loud music playing that simply didn’t vibe with the rest of the hotel. Food up there was hit or miss.",4,2023,03,25
29,Elegant hotel brimming with old-world glamour,"While staying in Barcelona for 3 nights, we stayed at el palace hotel in the classic double room. As we entered through the revolving doors, we were awe struck by the gorgeous lobby and great hall. We checked in with the helpful reception team, and was led to our room by the concierge. However, when we got up to our room, the door ajar and there was a ladder and paint can propped against the wall. It appeared as though a repair man was doing work on our room. 
The room itself was a bit small for our liking, but the bathroom was extremely spacious, which was quintessential for us. The rooms were clean and the overall condition of the room and it’s decorations were nice, but there were some slight blemishes on the carpet and the window seal, leading to a lessened soundproofing effect. 
The staff were helpful and attentive throughout our stay, with exception of the host of the grand hall restaurant being slightly pretentious and condescending.
However, the real star of the show was the breakfast buffet, which impressed us on all fronts. Served in a beautiful tented garden style area, countless of options were offered to us, including smoked salmon and blinis, dim sum options, and a selection of Iberian meats and cheeses. 
Overall, we were impressed with this hotel, and it provided a very unique, almost regal experience in Barcelona",4,2023,03,21
29,Old World Still Rocks!,"Fantastic location and from the moment we walked in you could smell the quality.
Previously a Ritz hotel & with many a story to tell.
Old world at its v best. If you’re after lots of glass, noise & modern this isn’t for you BUT if you love the way 5/6 star hotels once were this is THE place to stay in Barcelona.
Bedrooms v comfortable and subject to a recent makeover.
What was amazing was how quiet the common parts were and the hotel was pretty busy.
Breakfast was Superb.
Service from the entrance to maid service was superb.
We will return!",5,2023,03,21
29,Definitely want to return!,Everything about the hotel was top notch. The rooms were spacious and exquisite. The staff was the best we’ve encountered. It’s a great location as well — easily walkable to the Gothic Quarter as well as amazing shopping just a few blocks away. ,5,2023,03,17
29,Fabulous service in a beautiful hotel at a great location. ,"My teen daughter (19) and I stayed at Hotel El Palace for six nights in March 2023 while in Barcelona visiting my son (21) who was here for the semester. Not only is the hotel beautiful but it is in a great location, convenient to sightseeing, good restaurants and shopping with taxis lined up across from the front door so you never had to wait. It is also close to a Metro station. The room was beautiful and the beds were so comfortable. We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning and it was delicious (we happened to get a rate that included breakfast for two - worth every penny). What really set this hotel apart was the customer service. Everyone was very friendly and super helpful and could not have been more accommodating. The doorman whistled for a taxi and then told them where we wanted to go to make sure there were no translation issues. The porters were quick with the luggage and always had a smile on their face. The Concierge gave us great recommendations for dinner and was able to get us tickets when a particular website wasn't working on my laptop. If I am ever fortunate to travel back to Barcelona, I would definitely stay here again. Truly five star service.",5,2023,03,14
29,Fit for a Queen,"When visiting a city like Barcelona, consider how you want your accommodation experience to feel. Do you want modern Barcelona or more old world classic. We opted for a more classic historic building and stayed at El Palace. This hotel has an excellent central location for what we wanted to do and see in the city. We walked almost everywhere but taxis are very easy to hail. Pre arrival the hotel sent a questionnaire asking if we wanted certain things and we requested an ironing board and iron, and a coffee maker in room. Our classic room was spacious and clean. The fireplace and small balcony added to the ambiance of the nicely appointed room. We had plenty of closet space and a large bathroom with a wonderful rain shower and separate tub. The staff speaks English (and other languages) so communication was a breeze. A very well trained, professional and friendly staff attends to every need. The rooftop has a pool, 2 small restaurants and it’s the only hotel where you can enjoy a 360 view of Barcelona. We considered this an  added attraction and enjoyed a beverage there on a sunny afternoon. We also enjoyed dinner at the seafood restaurant Amar, top quality entertainment at The Bluesman Bar on the lower level, and a visit to the Mayan Luxury Spa. This is a 5 star hotel for good reason and we found it well worth the room price. So if you are thinking about a stay at an historic elegant property, with wonderful staff, this is the property for you. As with all hotels, prices go up or down with the seasons so if you want to save a little money, enjoy the hotel during non peak times.",5,2023,03,13
29,Amazing experience!,Our experience at El Palace Hotel was beyond expectations! Our friends and family came to visit the bluesmen cocktail bar in the hotel and was blessed to listen to Wax and the Boogie in such a comfortable environment. We will be back in soon. Highly recommended!,5,2023,03,09

29,An Iconic Cesar Ritz Palace Hotel--Extraordinary in Every Way,"I love the old “Palace” hotels of Europe, many of which were established by legendary hotelier Cesar Ritz. I’ve had the privilege to stay at several, and El Palace Barcelona perhaps ranks as the very best. It offers the quintessential classic luxury hotel experience that is increasingly harder to find, delivered by the most polished team of hospitality professionals I’ve ever experienced.

Just looking at the photos online, I knew this hotel would be the perfect choice for us for our first visit to Barcelona: location, legacy, and luxury—it has it all! From pre-arrival emails to our departure for the airport, it did not disappoint. 

Our go-to Virtuoso Network travel agent at Ourisman Travel handled the reservations for us, which gave us some wonderful perks: early check-in and late check-out, a room upgrade, breakfast, and dining and spa credits.  I contacted the concierge in advance to order an extravagant floral arrangement for the room, and it was indeed glorious. That, plus a lovely bottle of a Gran Reserva Cava, chocolates, sweets, and a handwritten note, made us feel incredibly welcome.

We were generously upgraded to a fifth floor Junior Suite with a quiet location facing the interior of the hotel. The room was huge for a junior suite, and positively enormous by European hotel standards. It had a long hallway separated from the bedroom by another door; a huge walk-in closet/dressing room with more than enough storage space for our over-packed suitcases; a vast marble clad bathroom with double sinks, soaking tub, two-person shower, and water closet; and an airy bedroom with king sized bed, nightstands, dresser, mini-bar, sofa and coffee table, desk and chair, upholstered walls, and generously draped windows. The overall effect was classic luxury—timeless, sumptuous, and plush.

We slept so well in the cloud-like bed with its excellent quality linens, down pillows and duvet. There was no audible noise from outside or from any nearby rooms. It was whisper quiet. In fact, we rarely saw other guests on our floor, and we never once saw a housekeeper making the rounds cleaning the rooms--they were so discrete/stealthy! I was just surprised (and a little disappointed) that the nightly turndown service did not leave any kind of mints, chocolates, or treats—even on Three Kings Day.

The breakfast buffet was a delightful way to start each of the five mornings of our stay. The offerings were vast, tasty, and beautifully presented. A small army of wait staff responded to guests’ needs almost intuitively; anything requested was brought in a flash. I cannot say enough about the food and beverage team at this hotel.

Twice we ordered room service because we were worn out from full days of sightseeing, and the orders were delivered promptly and with a smile. The food was delicious and elegantly presented, and they were even able to make a custom order of a simple chicken and rice soup one night when I wasn’t feeling very well. (And it was just what I wanted.)

One afternoon, we enjoyed lunch at the rooftop “Chalet” restaurant, a charming fantasyland of a space made to evoke the iconic aspects of a Swiss ski lodge. To us Canadians, however, 18 degrees Celsius feels almost like summer, so we weren’t really in the mood for fondue or raclette, so we had to settle for a short rib dish (delicious, but still too heavy/hearty for a lunch selection on a mild day). We wished the menu there was more varied, but the service was warm and polished, and it was a pleasant experience.

During our stay we made frequent stops at the concierge desk for directions or recommendations, and each of the concierges we dealt with was impressively knowledgeable and exceedingly kind and friendly. Les Clefs d’Or concierges can sometimes be a little standoffish or intimidating, but not here. I wish I had gotten their names to thank them here individually, but all were terrific assets to the hotel.

We would love to return to Barcelona (we barely scratched the vast surface of its incredible museums, historic sights, parks, shops, and restaurants), and if we do, there is nowhere else we would rather stay than El Palace. It’s an extraordinary, world-class hotel in an extraordinary, world-class city.",5,2023,01,15
29,12 Wonderful Nights!,"This classic, timeless, almost magical hotel met and exceeded our high expectations, highlighted by a spectacular, fun filled New Year's Eve celebration. An evening at the Bluesman Cocktail Bar was fantastic. Breakfast was excellent. Everywhere we looked was a feast for the eyes. When minor issues came up, the staff was quick to make things right, sometimes in extraordinary ways. 

Not being located in the heart of the tourist area is a plus, as the short walk is very easy and there is so much nearby, including La Whiskeria, a great bar just around the corner and great places to eat, like Patagonia and Lokal Bar.

I can't recommend El Palace enough. Cristhian and Victoria, especially, were wonderful, as was the maitre d' who saved our New Year's Eve! Thanks to all of the people there who made our stay so enjoyable and memorable.",5,2023,01,10
29,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"First class experience from arrival to departure. In total over the past 10 days we spent 5 at the El Palace (beginning and end of the trip).  On both occasion the experience was exceptional.  From the friendly bellman to the breakfast room server assistant the attention to detail was noted and appreciated.  Fabio, the bartender in the Grand Hall Bar, is incredibly creative and talented.  Ask him to prepare his award winning twist on a Negroni.  The rooms are large, clean and comfortable (one junior suite and one classic room).  On our next visit to Barcelona we will surely return to El Palace.",5,2023,01,10
29,Beautiful hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel-with a wonderful staff!  Christian,Carlos,Eloi were helpful and joyous everyday!! The Bed was very comfortable as well as the bathroom arrangement.  The rooftop cafe is awesome. Great location in this beautiful city",5,2023,01,10
29,my new home in Barcelona,"This place takes service and charm to a new level.  My wife and I were  warmly greeted by every employee who passed us in the hotel  during our stay.  The staff worked patiently with on our  subpar Spanish, providing tips and clarification.  The room was spotless and the food (tapas - -  try the  sea bass)  was gourmet level.  

 But the best part of the stay was the piano bar.  The piano  player  was a star.  He played every request and made the evenings very entertaining.  This guy made Chopin look like a beginner.  Now, this place is not inexpensive, but worth every penny if you are looking for a nice vacation with a little luxury.  My wife loved it, ",5,2023,01,09
29,Fabulous!,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous staff, stunning decor, perfect location, delicious food… I can’t say enough good things about this hotel!

29,Spoiled by this 5 Star Luxury Hotel,"Some hotels are listed as 5 star hotels but are not, this hotel is the real thing.  I am totally enthralled by this hotel.  Upon approach the outside of the hotel with it's beautiful 1919 style architecture and red awnings tells the approaching guest that this hotel is not like all the rest.  Though thoroughly remodeled and comfortable, the interior is the epitome of elegance.    The Halls is the lounge with high ceilings and is magnificent as is the bar area.  The breakfast room is basically a terrace that is cheerful and bright and displays a wonderful array of foods for breakfast.

I loved the elegant staircases and felt like royalty using them.  My room had a foyer and another inside door which made the room extremely quiet despite being in the midst of this vibrant city.  The room was spacious and had several surprises within which I won't mention in this review, but it reflects how smart the designers were in modernizing the hotel.  The towels and bedding were luxurious.  The bathroom had a tub and separate shower as well as a long bathroom counter.

I could have stayed there indefinitely!!

As far as the personnel/staff go - I was treated like a queen.  I was greeted warmly by reception.  A member of the staff brought me to my room to explain the features of the room and the hotel services.  

The concierge staff was better than any I have encountered in the 150 hotel nights that I have stayed in this year.  They anticipated needs, offered information and guidance that I didn't even think of to ask for AND helped me with an iPhone emergency (sim car issue) calmly and competently.

The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  

The hotel is close to the Gothic Quarter as well as many other sites and the metro.  

I highly recommend this hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,12,09
29,Wow!,This is one of the best hotels I have ever been. And I have been in hotels all over the world. We are planning to visit again very soon - like end of January. The main reason to plan a visit again in January is the amazing quality of El Palace hotel and unforgettable experience that we had there.,5,2022,12,02

29,Beautiful well situated hotel with awesome staff,"The hotel is beautiful and well situated. He room was comfortable with a small terrace that overlooked the western side of the city. The staff was excellent. The manager of the lobby restaurant bar and the breakfast dining area greeted us as we walked through. Each day he greeted us warmly, his smile is contagious! 
The concierge helped us with reservations etc. consistently helpful and courteous.
Truly a Lovely experience.

29,Impeccable Service and Stunning Views,"What an incredible stay. The service was impeccable, the views were stunning (inside and out), the beds were super comfortable and the rooftop bar and restaurant made for amazing views over the city with excellent food and drinks. I definitely want to stay there again if I visit Barcelona. An absolute treat!",5,2022,11,16
29,Stunning Hotel,"Absolutely beautiful hotel!  Very much enjoyed our stay. The staff were incredibly attentive, the food was delicious, couldn't ask for more. We enjoyed the daily breakfast as well as the turn down service in the evenings. There are a few options for dining. You can enjoy rooftop dining but bring a jacket as it gets cold when the sun sets. The Hall also serves a nice lunch and dinner along with nice drinks and desserts. There is a Speakeasy in the basement along with a cigar room.

The room was spacious, well decorated and clean. The staff was available to clean the room every morning and did turn down service in the evenings. The sheets were super soft with feather pillows. I personally found the bed a bit hard, but again very soft sheets that made up of that. 

The bathroom was spacious as well, with nice shampoo, conditioner and body wash. ",5,2022,11,16
29,Excellent!,"Why on earth do they not have a space under Who did you go With ,simply for ""spouse"" or partner?  
We stayed here years ago before the renovation.  Always had fond memories so booked again this year.  Wonderful renovations.  Everything was beautiful, very good breakfast with wide variety, service was excellent, room very comfortable, quiet, elegant.

29,Week-end at El Palace,"Wonderful room, very pleasant and cheerful welcome from the reception and the guest relation team.
The breakfast is served in a nice veranda. Everybody's tastes can be satisfied with the large choice of drinks, meals, fruits, bread, eggs,...
We fully recommend this Palace which is very well situated, as well.
We did not use it but the swimming-pool on the roof is large enough for a swim. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the roof-terrace for a drink in the evening with a marvelous view on the Sagrada Familia.",5,2022,11,14
29,Citytrip,"Fantastic stay in El Palace.   We were blown away from start till finish.   The staff was very helpfull and maid the stay a real 5-star experience.  The next time when we come to Barcelona,  we will book El Palace.",5,2022,11,14
29,Unbelievable customer orientation! Great staff!,Unbelievable customer service by front desk/concierge/restaurant staff. Didn't believe this kind of service still exists after Covid!! Hats off!

Best of the best and Im so happy that i could try it.",5,2022,11,10
29,A great stay for a 3 night break.,"A lovely hotel. It opened in 1919 and apparently used to be the Ritz and you can really tell walking around, it is beautifully appointed with a real character harking back to the 1920s. The room was really impressive, extremely comfortable and very nicely decorated. The Bars are particularly impressive both in terms of decor and service. A big plus is the rooftop restaurant/bar/terrace/pool which has great views of the city. 

The service is excellent, the staff are very friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble. 

Finally, it is a really good location for walking around Barcelona. 

 I would really strongly recommend. I don't really have any negatives to report. ",5,2022,11,07
29,The Best Hotel Ever,"It would be difficult in a single review to list all of the things that made El Palace the best hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at.  The lobby and common areas are elegant and beautiful.  The rooms are lovely, and the breakfast is the best we’ve ever had in any hotel but what truly makes El Palace a special place is its staff.

We arrived at the Palace somewhat upset after having had one of our bags stolen at the airport while retrieving our luggage.  Unfortunately, that bag contained all of our medications and we did not think we could continue our vacation without them.

Christian, at the concierge desk, immediately put us at ease and summoned a local doctor who wrote prescriptions for our medications which were promptly filled at a local pharmacy.  Within a short time, medication in hand and greatly relieved, we knew we would be able to continue our vacation.

Everyone we came in contact with at the Palace was extremely friendly and helpful and we could not be more grateful for the treatment we received, especially from Angel, the maître d  at the hotel lounge who could not have been more gracious and generous whenever we stopped by for lunch or a cocktail and, of course, Christian and the entire staff at the concierge desk.

The Palace is a truly special place, not only because its physical beauty, but because of its wonderful staff.
",5,2022,10,31
29,Mr and Mrs Peterson,"Our stay at the Palace was exceptional! The staff, accommodations and friendliness went far and beyond. The staff made you feel special and went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Well done!!!!",5,2022,10,30
29,"Great hotel, amazing service!","Everything is simply amazing, all the hotel amenities and the staff are great and welcoming , I visited back in 2017 and when I decided to go back this hotel was my first choice, we actually end up extending couple of days, because we felt like home. Definitely highly recommended.",5,2022,10,27
29,Amazing,"Wow....thank you a million times to all the staff at the hotel. We had an amazing time in your beautiful city and were spoilt from the start at this fabulous hotel...it truly is spectacular.
Thank you again 🥂🍾",5,2022,10,24
29,The most wonderful hotel we ever stayed!,"El Palace Hotel is probably the best hotel we ever stayed, since the first day we were treated very special, we get many complimentary gifts from the hotel, because our room was not ready on time, we got free drinks, we got free breakfast for both of us during our 3 days stay.
The staff in the hotel is super nice, Alejandro on the reception made our check in unforgettable, guest relation services are on a top level, special thanks to Amal, she made our stay unforgettable as well. 
About hotel:
1) Amazing breakfast, super tasty food, super tasty coffee.
2) Amazing lobby bar, atmosphere 10/10, music from 60/70’s, ohhhh just insane!!!
3) Rooftop terrace is just outstanding, gorgeous pool area, cinema area, what can be better?
4) Blues Bar in the hotel reminds you an atmosphere from Great Gatsby movie, this is just something you can not explain. 
5) Our room (which was just a classic room) was outstanding, everything was so perfect. 
6) Concierge guys will help you with everything, special thanks to them as well.

Thanks to all personal in the hotel! We are coming back, see you soon…",5,2022,10,17
29,Beautiful classic hotel,"We first stayed at this property in 2018 prior to a Mediterranean cruise, and based on our experience then chose it for this stay which also preceded a cruise.
The very best advice we can offer to anyone arriving on an overnight flight from the states is this:  to guarantee without question that your room is ready book it for the night previous to your arrival.  We arrived at about 9 am and noted several people waiting for their rooms.  Our was ready and in fact had had turn down service for the night previous.  Perfect for us to fall into bed for an hour nap and refresh.   
We booked a superior suite this stay and found it more than adequate.  A living room, large bedroom and nice sized bathroom with walk in closet were just fine.   Twice daily housekeeping was appreciated.   Breakfast in the atrium was lovely as well.  Staff will remember your beverage choices after day one which is impressive.  The offerings were more than enough for us, but if you want eggs cooked to order or pancakes that is cheerfully brought to you (for an additional charge).  
We enjoyed a fantastic dinner at Amar and highly recommend it.  As well we dined one evening in El Hall, which is the restaurant at the far end of the lobby.  It was also great and the staff there is outstanding.  A glass of wine in the huge lobby seating area was a lovely experience, too.  A pianist was playing our first night (he had been playing for afternoon tea) and we really enjoyed him.
If we had one criticism it would be that in the bathroom there are tiles in need of repair, and the towel bar is not turned on.  That may have something to do with the energy issues in Europe right now and it did not adversely affect our stay.  
We would absolutely choose this hotel again.  The lovely spaces, convenience to the Passeig Garcia (for shopping) as well as to the port and other sites makes it a great choice.",5,2022,10,11
29,A true Palace and where everyone should stay!,"I can't think of a better place to stay in Barcelona. The team are so friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location for tourists and those in town for business. The hotel has a rich arts, cultural, and musical heritage which is reflected throughout the hotel. We stayed in the Josephine Baker Suite and it is magical and huge! Make sure you head to the rooftop which is the best in Barcelona and Amar for incredible seafood by Rafa Zafra. We can't wait to go back!",5,2022,10,10
29,"Amazing hotel, fabulous staff, and plentiful amenities","Hotel El Palace is one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever stayed at. Every member of the staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The doorman, front desk staff, and porters were all lovely. The room decor was perfect and had all the amenities you could need. This is a luxury hotel that provides everything you could hope for. I cannot wait to come back.",5,2022,10,04
29,"Excellent location, outstanding rooms and elite customer service","Central location was perfect for our sightseeing and shopping vacation. Rooms were beautiful, roomy and luxuriously appointed. Concierge desk was extremely professional and helpful. That alone made the trip to Barcelona worthwhile. Rooftop bar and restaurant were top of the line. My only criticism regards the breakfast buffet. While the serving staff were attentive and friendly the food offerings were sub par for a hotel of that stature. We stayed at two other 4/5 star hotels in Spain during our month long trip and found the El Palace's breakfast buffet the least appealing. Given the number of guests at breakfast every morning, the hotel should have one or two cook stations for made to order eggs. They should also expand their food offerings and change some of some of them up daily to provide some culinary variety for the extended stay guests.",5,2022,09,27
29,The best hotel experience ever,"El Palace is located close to Passeig de Gracia and Plaza Catalunya. Everything is in a walking distance, though you don't really want or need to leave the hotel. The hotel originates back to 1919 and it's a former Ritz. 

Service:
The Concierge team's service was above and beyond. You feel valued and respected throughout your stay and everyone treats you like you're the best guest of theirs. We spent three nights and the service was impeccable every day. 

Room: 
El Palace has sound-proof windows and the room was really quiet. Cleanliness was on a top level and their evening service provided lovely gestures like a bedtime story. Our room was spacious and bed very comfortable. 

Public areas:
El Palace is a classical hotel and the atmosphere is close to royal. Their rooftop bar has a decent size pool and the area was not at all busy during our stay. Breakfast was served in a separate dining area on the ground floor and provided a wide selection of fresh food.

Overall: I would definitely go again and will recommend to everyone visiting Barcelona. El Palace hotel experience is a money well spent.",5,2022,09,23
29,Classic Luxury,"El Palace was an oasis during the summer in Barcelona. The location was very central and within 15 minutes walk from most attractions. Upon entering (the doormen were always pleasant and helpful),  we found the hotel to be an elegant, relaxing experience.  We had a family suite and there was an immense amount of space and wonderful fresh floral arrangements in each room.  Our family also loved the rooftop pool and lounge in the heat of the afternoon.  The concierge staff were incredibly helpful and gave us a number of great recommendations.  

My negatives were very minor. The breakfast room was lovely but very crowded and the buffet was a bit repetitive.  We were also asked for our room requests prior to checking in. None of the requests were provided, which makes me think that the hotel did not look at our response.  In that case, why ask?

Overall, this was a fantastic stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to return.",5,2022,09,21
29,Barcelona Luxury,"We really enjoyed our six-night stay at the El Palace. The attentive staff really pampers the guests. The gorgeous hotel is located  perfectly among the city's many attractions. While the area is busy, our room was courtyard facing and noise was not an issue. Room service and the morning breakfasts are highly recommeded.",5,2022,09,17
29,Treated like Royalty,"Can’t begin to tell you how wonderful it was at El Palace
 it was clearly a five-star hotel one of the best that I’ve been to in my whole lifetime service was impeccable detail to the room cleanliness and that making this spectacular
 food deserves a one Michelin star as we visit another star restaurants in Barcelona and one  didn’t match up to the Great food of the Hall 
restaurant
Loved it and will definitely come back",5,2022,09,10
29,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"The greatest strength of this amazing hotel is its concierge staff, who is central to the hotel. They are amazingly efficient and friendly. The concierge staff made all our restaurant & tour bookings and organised all our transfers from and to airport. The location is perfect, close to all attractions. The building is beautiful and rooms very comfortable. The service especially by the cleaning staff and the restaurant staff for breakfast were excellent! This hotel is very highly recommended!",5,2022,09,04
29,Great pick for a visit to Barcelona,"As so often happens when you fly to Europe from North America, we arrived mid-morning and many hours before the stated check-in time.  I was hopeful that the hotel would be able to honor the SELECT perk of early check-in, but they said they'd been at capacity and that the room set aside for us hadn't yet been vacated.  So we sat in the lounge and waited.  And waited.  For roughly four hours.  Not a great start!

However, we were extremely pleased with our room (601) which had a little balcony and even a view of Sagrada Familia.  The room wasn't large, but more than adequate and had plenty of nice amenities.  We didn't get our welcome bottle of cava as expected, but did get a €50 spa credit, €90 food and beverage credit, and both complimentary WiFi and (more importantly) daily breakfast for two.

I can't say enough good things about the breakfast.  The ambiance of the dining area is lovely, the staff is attentive, and the food, while lukewarm at best even from the chaffing dishes, covered the gamut from cheese, fruit and yogurt to eggs, bacon, and pastries.  Nearly anything you might want.

The internet was good enough for most things, though we found that, upstairs and at the end of the hall as we were, it could be a little unstable sometimes.  We didn't visit the spa, but did head to the rooftop one evening (TIP: make reservations!) for drinks and tapas.  That was really lovely, and the rooftop is certainly the place to be on nice evenings.  The pool is also there, though it's very small.

We were able to walk to the older section of the city in about 15 minutes.  There's a grocery store at the next corner, a pastry shop and restaurant across the street, and lots of other dining options all around and within an easy walk.  It really is a fantastic location.  Barcelona is a very walkable city, and taxis are easy to get (and take credit cards!) if you need to go further.  You're no more than a five minute walk from Passeig de Gràcia if you have the itch to exercise your credit cards.

There is some room for improvement, but it's nothing major.  I've been putting clients here for years and was very pleased to have the chance to try it for myself.  Based on this experience, I will continue to do so.",5,2022,08,27
29,Top class hotel!,"At the Hotel El Palace, everything is 5 stars. The welcome, the concierge... The room: crisp fresh sheets every day in a super soft bed. No noise from other rooms or the city. Wonderful breakfast. There is a small patio where you can sit outside. 

And then the service at dinner. A big compliment to Marc and Miguel. They were really great. Marc can make such good cocktails! Super friendly too. And very kind to our 9 year old daughter. They made our holiday complete! 

Greetings from Geertrui, Philippe and Julie",5,2022,08,27
29,"Luxurious experience, Outstanding customer service, spacious room, great location  and architecturally beautiful","Definitely we are gonna go back again, we do travel to Europe yearly and this hotel has an outstanding customer service, great location and its family friendly.  The staff delivered the highest level of personalized service, at every interaction during our stay. Special thanks to Ms. Amal she’s very professional.",5,2022,08,26
29,Beautiful old hotel,"we stayed for 5 nights in Aug 2022. The hotel was very busy during that period. we requested for an upgrade at the time of check-in as we are a family of 5 and wanted to stay near each others plus that the rooms were not ready till 4pm.  we were promised to be contacted next day regarding the upgrade  but no one came back. The lunch at the main restaurant was not up to the standard of a 5 start hotel, but breakfast was very good. the rooms were very clean, but needs be refurnished (very old carpet and furniture). there are no single mirror in the room expect the bathroom. also there is no coffee machine or coffee (only tea) in the room which is very weird for 5 star hotel.  although we enjoined our experience in general, but would try a newer hotel in our next trip for sure.",4,2022,08,23
29,Incredible Customer Service,"We stayed at the Hotel El Palace during the second part of our trip to Spain. The first leg of our trip was in Mallorca, and we stayed at a modern style resort. Upon entering the El Palace, I could tell it was exactly what I was hoping for. Regal and classic. The room was a nice size and had a lot of character. Our view was of the city which was nice to see the architecture and people moving about. The bathroom had been updated and I always a appreciate a hotel that has a separate space for the toilet with a door to provide privacy while also allowing others to use the sinks or showers. 

The location was perfect and we walked almost everywhere, except when our child got too tired at night. 

The pool was great and had amazing views of the city as it was on the rooftop. My only complaint was the outrageous price of drinks at the roof top bar. We had been surprised at how affordable Barcelona was for many things including food and drink, so the drink cost caught us off guard. 

The most impressive part by far in terms of this hotel was it's staff. You can tell that customer services is a priority for them. We didn't require much (ironing board one night, and ordered room service the next) but any questions or requests we had were met with genuine responses and help. I think we can all tell when customer service is an expectation, but the individual themselves is not truly invested in exemplifying that. This couldn't be further from the truth here. The authentic offers to help, or just a good morning or good evening, left a lasting impression on us. We absolutely hope to return!",5,2022,08,21
29,A Beautiful Palace,"This was formerly the Ritz.   And it is definitely ""ritzy"".  We had a wonderful 4 nights at the Palace.

It is beautiful.  And that is an understatement.  The public areas are breathtaking.   And the hotel rooms are very nice and very comfortable.  The bedrooms are well appointed  and are wonderfully decorated.  The bathrooms are modern.

The breakfast buffet is excellent.

Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The rooftop pool is small but adequate.  And the views from up there are excellent.

The Palace is located centrally.  Just a block or 2 from La Rambla's high fashion shopping area,

We will be back next summer.",5,2022,08,11
29,Our before and after oasis in the beautiful port of Barcelona for our Mediterranean cruise,This elegant but yet welcoming and comfortable hotel exceeded all our expectations from the gracious helpful staff to the delicious food to the luxurious decor! Our family of 7 felt very pampered. The rooftop views are spectacular whether you were there for a swim a meal or a refreshing cocktail.  Breakfast in the garden terrace was a delightful way to begin the day and the food and service in the aMar Barcelona was superb!,5,2022,08,04
29,Beautiful El Palace,"A beautiful hotel. Room was spacious and well-appointed. Breakfast was excellent. Concierge was very, very helpful. I highly recommend this centrally located hotel. Beautiful lobby and bar area. Well priced for the luxury that was there",5,2022,07,30
29,"Exceeded all expectations, by far.","Sparkling clean and luxurious rooms in a perfect location. Amiable and professional staff. Good breakfast, great coffee. Highly recommended. We were a party of 11 looking for a short 3-night stop before embarking on a cruise, and Hotel El Palace was a perfect choice.",5,2022,07,25
29,Lovely stay,"This classic hotel has it all. perfect location, amazing staff. The rooms are spacious and super clean. They even accept dogs. The terrace is a lovely place to have some fresh meal. the pool is not big but its big enough to be fresh on the Catalan heat.",5,2022,07,18
29,5 Stars,"This hotel is beautiful and offers service unparalleled to any other hotel I’ve been to around the world. Prior to my stay, the hotel reached out and asked what time I’d be arriving so that my room would be ready for check in. The hotel itself is big, beautiful, and historic. The room was updated but with old school charm and was comfortable, spacious, and well decorated. Highly recommend!",5,2022,07,17
29,Spectacular on every level,Absolutely marvelous. From the moment we arrived our room was ready and the staff went out of their way to make every part of our stay spectacular.  A special mention to Tatiana you was simply the best and went out of her way to make sure our stay was just perfect. I would also like to mention Hugo as well who was so nice and always had a smile on his face even when delivering room service at 7:30 in the morning.  We can’t wait to return soon.,5,2022,07,11
29,Absolutely charming and elegant hotel,This is an outstanding hotel with an incredible service culture amongst the staff. Their level of general happiness and service quality is something I have rarely seen before. The room we were in was with modern appliances and well appointed. Overall the hotel has a charming throwback feel to a bygone era and is a lovely place to stay at when visiting Barcelona. The bar downstairs is a great meeting place. The rooftop bar too is lively and wonderful afternoon place. There is a cute pool and the new restaurant in the El Palace is to die for. There is also an elegant live band blues bar open from Thur - Sun. Very happy and will be sure to repeat my lovely experience there when we are back in Barcelona.,5,2022,07,04
29,Elegant Hotel in Central Barcelona,"I had the wonderful opportunity of staying at this Hotel with my sister for a short city break.  The hotel is situated in a great location for either going down to the port of seeing the sights like the Sagrada Familia and is in the heart of town for upscale shopping.  From the moment we entered the hotel we were made to feel so special and all of the staff really looked after us.  The concierge team were so helpful and even remembered us by name and room number when ever we went to the desk.

We stayed in room 421 which was a junior suite.  The room faced the interior of the hotel which meant it was so quite and peaceful.  Everything in the room was so elegant and well appointed and housekeeping added all the special touches when you went out for the day making sure the room was lovely when you returned.

The communal rooms are so opulent and grand you feel so special but they were also welcoming and a pleasure to use.

We ate at the Rooftop terrace restaurant and bar on both nights.  The food did not disappoint and we were lucky enough to be at the St Joans celebrations on our second night with live music and fireworks.  The staff remembered on the second night what wine and cocktails we liked to drink and made our evenings very pleasant - they could not do enough for you.

I would love to come and stay here again when I next visit Barcelona it was a real treat.  Yes it is expensive but as they say you only get what you pay for.",5,2022,06,27
29,Fantastic choice to stay,"The hotel service, cleanliness, and elegance, as well as location far exceeded our expectations. From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated by professional attentive staff. 
From hotel we had easy access to just about every attractions as well as many fantastic places for drink and food
This is the only place we will stay when we return.",5,2022,06,19
29,Excellent visit after bumpy check-in,"We arrived at El Palace hotel around 10:30 AM after our 9 hour flight. Our travel agent told us there was a possibility of early check-in. We were told this was not available to us. The breakfast service was closing but we were allowed to get something to eat. We chose to walk around Barcelona for an hour or two. When we returned, our rooms were still not ready. We were assured the rooms were ""almost ready"". Eventually, we were shown to rooms, but it turned out they were not our rooms and we had to go back down to the lobby. It was actually after check-in time that we eventually got to our rooms.

Even with the rough start our stay at El Palace was great. The hotel is in a great location with many nice restaurants within easy walking distance. The rooms were very nice and large. Our room had a very convenient ""locker"" area for our luggage. The service throughout our stay was excellent from the morning breakfast buffet to the evening bar. The concierge was especially helpful and went above and beyond.

We would highly recommend El Palace to anyone staying in Barcelona. Much of our rough start could be attributed to jet lag and the stay was flawless after this.",4,2022,06,04
29,A Real Palace in Barcelona,"After a Silversea Cruise on the Meditereanean, we've stayed here another 5 more days to explore Barcelona.
What a nice hotel the Palace hotel is.
I can mention every part of the hotel, but that is not neccessary, everything is excellent.  I must say we've had the best breakfast in years in this hotel.  Everything is from a very good quality, not all cheap of course but worth it.
I must mention all staff is very friendly and helpful.  Mr. Domingo Velasco (Commercial Director) can be proud of the achievements of the whole ""El Palace"" team.
Next time we visit Barcelona, we definitly go to El Palace !",5,2022,06,01
29,The best service ever!,"From the moment of our arrival to the moment of our departure for our cruise three days later, we felt like family. Every member of the hotel staff spoke beautiful English, and went out of his/her way to help us accomplish our sometimes not-too-easy goals. The rooftop bar was a lovely place to wait for our room, as our flight arrived early. The garden room was lovely for breakfast, and the hotel rooms were spacious and very clean, although we had a bit of difficulty figuring out how to use the shower. (It's universal in Europe, though.) This is a truly lovely hotel, but one needs to remember the address, as there are several ""El Palace"" hotels in Barcelona, so taxi drivers may be confused.",5,2022,05,26
29,Sensational,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for 4 days to celebrate my birthday and my husband’s 60th. We couldn’t possibly have had a more perfect time. The manager Freidrich, Domingo, Pablo, Amal and Alison ( at breakfast) all went out of their way to make our visit extra special, as did every member of the team we met. Our suite was absolutely incredible.... thank you so much!!! The endless champagne and birthday cake, good wishes and balloons were so appreciated by us. My husband said that the breakfast was the best he had ever had in Spain ( we live here too!!!) An absolutely incredible experience and one we cannot wait to repeat. Thank you all so very much.",5,2022,05,23
29,Traditional and very nice,"Old, traditional hotel. Former ""Ritz"". Partly a bit worn out, but overall very nice. Beautiful roof top terrace and pool. Excellent staff. Breakfast was very good, in a kind of winter garden, temperature was good.",5,2022,05,19
29,Amal made it 5 stars,"The hotel was an old Ritz, our room was big and bright, and I would like to thank Amal from the guest Relations, she was very helpful may be the main reason for full 5 stars.
The hotel is fancy and in the heart of Barcelona but the human interaction made it special",5,2022,05,17
29,It was simply WONDERFUL!,"The Ritz would be proud of what is still going on in this gorgeous hotel. Everybody, and I mean everybody, from the staff did a wonderful job of making us feel at home away from home. TIZIANA from the front desk went the extra mile and really did everything to make us feel comfortable. If I win the lottery, I would stay there forever. Can't wait to be back!",5,2022,05,17
29,Amazing Hotel which will make your stay unforgettable,Service is absolutely fantastic! Food is very tasty and gourmet to rival Michelin restaurants. Please do yourself a favour and book your stay in this hotel. One of the best hotel experiences I ever had.  Highly recommended!,5,2022,05,04
29,Elegant Hotel with Wonderful Service,"This property was beautiful, the service was first class and the location was perfect. The hotel is elegant and well maintained. The rooms are spacious with updated bathrooms including double sinks, stall showers and separate bathtubs. The lobby bar is opulent and classy with friendly and efficient service. The hotel is  walking distance to tons of shops, restaurants and attractions. The staff went out of their way to be helpful in every way. One night it was raining so hard, the doorman stood on the street in the rain for over 5 minutes tracking down a taxi for us and made sure the taxi driver knew where to take us. There was turn down service every night and water and towels were always replenished.   The only negative was the very tiny gym. But we loved the hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,05,01
29,One of the finest staffs and most beautiful hotels in Europe.,"The hotel and staff are awesome.  Stayed here for three days before boarding a cruise.  From when you first step into the lobby you are well taken care of.  
Tatiana in guest services greeted us and showed us our room.  Truly a very nice person, and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect..  The concierge “Alex” was wonderful and helped us with several things.
I would heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay at what I would consider probably the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at.  Beautiful rooms, and the breakfasts are great.",5,2022,05,01
29,Amazing property and outstanding service,"Really cannot say enough good things about our stay at Hotel El Palace Barcelona. The property is gorgeous and in a wonderful, central location. The service is top notch. From the front desk, who gave us an upgrade, to the concierge desk, who helped us with everything from taxis to tickets to dinner reservations, to the delicious daily breakfast served in a beautiful room. It was all outstanding and I highly recommend this property.",5,2022,04,30
29,Beyond divine!,"The staff was outstanding!
The cappuccino the best in Europe!
Front desk very considerate and helpful!
Bar was lovely the cocktails were fantastic!
Old world charm with modern conveniences!
The room was lovely always clean and impeccable!
6 star property!
Cannot wait to return in August!",5,2022,04,25
29,An Amazing visit to this World Class Hotel,"While staying in a hotel a block away from the Palace, and happened to walk in as the Palace seemed inviting.  What a wonderful place, beautiful decor, the lobby was beautifully done.  Further the Bar Staff was great, the best drinks, including very cold and dry Martinis (Made by Gerardo the bar tender).  We felt so welcome that we had 
dinner there two nights in a row.  The entire staff was great from the door man, desk personnel, and of course the Bar and Restaurant. Next time in Barcelona we will stay at this hotel, it is amazing.....This must be one of the best Hotels in the World !!!",5,2022,04,16
29,"Wonderful hotel, needs some guest-oriented attention in room design","Elegant 5-star hotel. Service was great all-around. Our Deluxe Double room was very nice, but although while generally modern (including mirror-TV), someone needs to focus more on some things. One, we had to crawl on the floor and disconnect lamps to connect devices to few outlets. Two, inadequate closet space. Three, shower has no place other than floor to rest soap, etc., so one is bending down repeatedly to pick up and put down (and most guests in 5 star hotels are not 25 years old). Speaking of soap, what's in the bathroom are only those industrial size cannisters of soap, shampoo, etc. - not a good look. Bar of soap is available on request. But those things aside, I highly recommend this hotel. ",4,2022,04,13
29,"Best stay in Barcelona . Cant beat the rooms, service, or location!","I gave 5 stars only because 10 wasn't an option. This place, the people, and the foood and entertainment were amazing! The bellman ended up or favorite person.. always happy and very helpful. The concierge was very helpful to whether it was to get directions, an umbrella, or just tips on staying safe. Thanks for a great week!",5,2022,03,24
29,The best in World,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 days. We had a great time at the hotel. All the staff at the hotel from Concierge, Room service and in the restaurants were great. 
I believe El Palace is the best hotel in the world because of the people and the services they provide. All staff at the hotel is excellent and extremely friendly.

Hotel is ideally located to explore Barcelona and very safe for the family.",5,2022,03,01
29,Family,"Lovely historical hotel with wonderful  interior and nice spirit. The great staff who are always ready to help you.  Spacious rooms with a view of the main attractions of the city.  Very tasty and beautiful breakfasts.  But the most important thing for us as a travelers  was that the team completely solved all our questions and inconveniences, and were very kind and hospitable! Back again for sure.",5,2022,02,26
29,"Fabulous afternoon tea, Barcelona","Wow. Afternoon tea at El Palace was just beautiful. From the decor of the hotel to the amazingly attentive but unintrusive staff. We were there 2 hours and there was no rushing us even though a wedding reception/drinks were being served half way through our tea. The lovely staff made sure everything was ok for us, replenishing the tea pot when needed and cream for our scones. Definitely somewhere special to go for a fabulous relaxed afternoon in the rain.  We had forgotten to say that one of us  didn’t eat meat and they whisked away the plate of sandwiches with no fuss and brought it back with stunningly tasty crab sandwiches instead of meat. Totally our fault but they made it seem not. Truely an amazing experience hosted by excellent staff. Thank you.",5,2022,02,20
29,The Place to stay and enjoy Barcelona,"Was really amazed with the El Palace. Rooms, location, lobby, cinema on the roof, attentive staff and knowledgable concierge really made the trip wonderful. El Palace became in my list of most beloved European hotels: Four Seasons’ George V in Paris, Beau-Rivage in Lausanne. It is definitely the place to stay and enjoy Barcelona",5,2022,02,10
29,"Fabulous, anywhere!","From the time we arrived, till the time we left, everything was unbelievable. The service superior.  The decor, beautiful, clean, sparkling.  Every staff member bent over backwards to make sure it was a great trip, and it was.  And this was our second time here and will not be the last.
Do not miss this experience.",5,2022,01,16
29,Great experience and location of former Ritz Hotel (El Palace Barcelona),"El Palace was once the emblematic Ritz Hotel in Barcelona. As of today you can admire the details from tycoon Cesar Ritz in 1919. The location is superb, the size of rooms are big and comfortable in comparison with European standards, and all the people working there were always trying to be helpful. Outstanding service and attitude from Alexis at the front desk, always willing to assist with anything. We really felt like being at home.",5,2021,11,17
29,Excellent hotel,"This old world hotel is impeccably maintained and provides service consistent with its 5* rating. Once you check in, the hotel staff will remember your name, the wait staff remembers your preferences and everyone exceeds expectations. The rooms are large by European standards and well appointed. The restaurant serves excellent food and the view from the rooftop is terrific. This should be everyone's first choice hotel in Barcelona.",5,2021,11,09
29,Elegant and Classic With Fantastic Rooftop Amenities,"This property is truly a class act.  They know how to make guests feel welcome and pampered from the moment one walks onto the property's porte cochere to the front desk to the room to the various restaurants and other amenities within the property.  We stayed in a really interesting room - 606- which has a small patio with statues on both sides.  Breakfast was excellent and the whole vibe of the property was very positive.  Also the rooftop terrace features fantastic views, a nice pool and a great bar/restaurant which was really fun and charming.  All in all El Palace is a big winner.",5,2021,10,06
29,"Fantastic place, Fantastic staff !","Just back form there... The Hotel is truely worthy of the palaces of the last century with all the 5 stars amenities of today. The roof garden is beautiful, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to an absolutely sublime room (419). But the great strength of this palace lies also and above all in the involvement and professionalism of its staff, from the maid who makes the most impeccable beds in the world, to the wise and precious advice of Gwen at the reception, without forgetting the exceptional kindness and exceptional quality of service of the ladies of the restaurant at breakfast and lunch time (A big thank you to Victoria and Cathy for their constant smiles)
Thank you all ! We'll be back, for sure !",5,2021,09,21
29,No refund if cancellation,"No refund if the event is cancelled!!! Be careful!!!! Then they tell you you cannot have the money back!! 
No te devuelven el dinero si se cancela el evento como nos paso… después te dicen que no te pueden devolver el dinero. Como en muchos casos el consumidor se ve afectado",1,2021,09,05
29,5 Star Stay,"We returned to El Palace to reprise our honeymoon stay from 2003 with our children.  Our memories of EL Palace were just as good, if not better, as our first visit in 2002.  We enjoyed our connecting room with our teenagers, the roof deck and pool and of course the excellent hospitality and service by the front desk staff and concierge.  Our stay in Barcelona was made even better by the recommendations and service to pre-buy museum and Sagrada Famiglia tickets.  Check-in was a little slow but worth the wait.",5,2021,08,16
29,Highly recommend it,"Great location, lovely staff. It not cheap but it correct for its value. Lovely views of the city. Small but cute pool. Highly recommend the restaurant in the rooftop, as well as the breakfast. Will come back and will recommend it. 
The rooms are big and confortable. Specially good great with dogs",5,2021,08,14
29,What a beautiful hotel!,We had a short stay here after a few recommendations from friends and it was a great decision. From the moment the doorman opens your car door you feel transported to a different time and era while offering modern and relevant concepts as expected in a cosmopolitan city like Barcelona. The Hotel is carefully manicured and insuperably located. The staff is both attentive and professional and nothing seems to much. Great experience that we will surely repeat!,5,2021,08,10
29,An absolute gem in Barcelona,"Stayed here with my wife and daughter last weekend and it was a fabulous experience from start to finish. Very well taken care property with great concepts, an amazing roof top terrace and pool with the most stunning view of BCN I have ever seen. The staff is very attentive, from doormen to servers  to the housekeeping team who set up our beautiful room with great care and even a plush toy of Lulu, their pet relations manager! :) 

Great Hotel in a great location - we will be back!",5,2021,08,10
29,Fantastic Rooftop: perfect summer weekend,"This hotel has one of the best rooftops in Barcelona with a very young and cool vibe in the evenings. Great live music, rooftop cinema, fantastic cocktails. My room was large and comfortable and the service throughout the hotel was brilliant. It's perfectly located for most trips and excursions. The breakfast was very generous and was served on the fantastic rooftop. Really dreamy weekend - will definitely return to El Palace",5,2021,08,06
29,Fabulous Hotel & Experience,"Absolutely adored our stay at this hotel!  Made our Barcelona and Costa Brava experience even more special.  

The lobby, foyer area, hallways are beautiful and clean.  The roof and pool are an added treat!  The pool is much needed and refreshing after a day walking around the city.  

We rented a car and the concierge always made sure to have the car ready for us when we requested.

We had organized our day trips around Barcelona and Costa Brava, but our last day didn't have any plans.  The concierge helped plan a perfect day south of Barcelona.  We were offered amazing suggestions and really had a special day!

Shout out to Pablo  who runs the front desk.  He is the epitome of professionalism, personable and overall goes above and beyond for the visitors that stay at this fantastic hotel!  

Bravo Hotel El Palace BCN.  Thank you for an incredible stay!",5,2021,07,27
29,Absolutely wonderful hotel,The hotel El Palace in Barcelona offers great service and the rooms are beautiful and very confortable. The Roof Top restaurant and pool are such a nice get away after visiting the city. The staff was one of the kindest we have ever experienced! We hope to be back one day!,5,2021,07,24
29,Best birthday hotel experience!!,"Went there to celebrate my birthday for a night and The Palace made sure to make it the most amazing and unforgettable experience ever. We were greeted with champagne (super concierge service), and our room was perfect. We had breakfast and lunch on the rooftop (both exquisite!) and enjoyed the afternoon at the pool. They have a full calendar of activities and events happening on the rooftop constantly. If you have the chance, don’t miss out on dinner at their Secret Garden and a session of open air cinema. 10/10, will be back very soon!!",5,2021,07,13
29,Amazing hotel with the best rooftop breakfast in Barcelona!!,"We had a great stay with our two teenage girls ,great city centre  location,walking distance to much of the city,great staff great service and great food in a really classic city hotel!!!
The suites are really worth upgrading to ,an amazing experience.
We will be back!",5,2021,07,08
29,Best Hotel in Barcelona!!!,"Former Ritz Hotel, El Palace is without a doubt the best and most luxurius Hotel in Barcelona. The staff is fantastic! They help you in everything you need and they have all the guidelines for a safe stay. We slept in the Dali Suite and it's completely worth it!!! I highly recommend it. We will be back!!!",5,2021,06,26
29,Back to my second home,"I was so happy that after 380 days of closure due to Covid, El Palace was finally able to reopen early April. I went to spend a 3-night stay on May 13 and I loved it. Though the hotel was not 100% operational (only 2 floors were open. The beautiful winter garden and the bar downstairs are still closed due to the Covid) everything was perfect. Breakfast and bar are located for the moment on the rooftop (7th floor) where you have a breathtaking view over Barcelona. The staff, as usual, is very professional and friendly. The reception, for the moment, is closed, and it is the Concierge who is taking care of check-in / check-out but, taking room service order. However, the service remains top-notch. A special mention to Alexis. 

The new General Manager breathed a wind of modernity. They have a Pet Relation Manager, called Lulu, an adorable dachshund. They have a Sunday Vermouth formula for 18 euros with a live band from 12noon to 15h00 which includes vermouth, potato chips, chicken croquette, coca bread with tomato, and Iberian ham. 

I was very happy to see the familiar faces. I can't wait until El Palace is 100% operational again and to be back to my favorite hotel in Barcelona.",5,2021,05,23
29,Rooftop Astonishing View Experience,"This Divine Hotel aesthetical factory of multiple Views of Barcelona city.
+ Heaven of Cocktails and meals + swimming pool + music.
Try to explore it atleast once in life time. You wouldn't regret for sure.",5,2021,01,16
29,Open air cinema,"What a delightful idea for this hotel to have created this open air cinema. Amazing views, very comfortable long chairs, excellent cocktails, blankets and umbrelas provided (if needed). 
We had dinner earlier the jamon was amazing, the tomato salad lacked a bit of salt but it was saved by an excellent organic local red wine. Local mineral water was also available (unfortunately not sparkling).
Overall a wonderful Sunday night, as good as they can get.",5,2020,09,07
29,Freddie Mercury & Montsy First Met At This Hotel,"Being the fact the Freddie & Montsy first met at this hotel where Freddie stayed, I was in awe.  The service were kind and understanding about the reasons I and many others as tourists show up to the hotel, who are not staying there.  Wonderful experience.",5,2020,04,13
29,The King and Queen Loved El Palace!,"This 101-year-old hotel is outstanding in every way!  It is in an excellent location in this walkable city, close to shopping, good restaurants, tourist attractions, and even the harbor.  The service was outstanding by the receptionists, bellmen, and waiters.  The restaurants we tried at the hotel were both wonderful, and we enjoyed checking out the Bluesman Bar too.  They had live music starting at 11:00 p.m., and that was too late for us.
The breakfast buffet was excellent, and in an elegant room.
The hotel has been renovated, and is the utmost in elegance.  Our junior suite was spacious, comfortable, quiet, had a lovely balcony in the front of the hotel with an amazing view.  We loved it!  
Unfortunately, our visit  was marred by Spain enacting a lockdown due to the coronavirus.  Starting on Saturday, all restaurants and tourist attractions were closed.  Still, our hotel took good care of us and stayed calm.  It was the only place we were able to eat on our last day, so we appreciated them staying open for us.
Thank you for making our first visit to Barcelona so memorable!",5,2020,03,24
29,Awesome!,"Well kept 100 years old hotel, located on the Grand Via and 10 mins walk to Paseig de Gracia. Superb room with fireplace and modern batrhroom. High standard in room amenities.

The television in the room is cleverly placed behind a huge mirror hung on the wall and the minibar is hidden behind a painting. The decor in the room and within the hotel depicts of palaces in Europe.

Breakfast was good with good spread. Service here was also impacable. There is a rooftop restaurant nicely set up and you should try it out when you are there.

If you plan to shop in Barcelona, this hotel would be a great choice.",5,2020,03,19
29,Amazing rooftop retreat,"We were looking for somewhere for lunch in Barcelona where we could soak up some sun away from the crowds. 
Upon entering the building the bell boys gave us a brief history of the hotel, we didn’t know that it was previously owned by the Ritz group and was established by Cezar Ritz. Once inside the decor was very similar and was clean and well maintained. When we reached the Winter Garden on the 7th floor we were impressed with the lovely roof top pool and bar area. We had a quick drink before going inside for lunch. For starters we ordered the scallops and cod melt. Both were wonderful and tasty. For mains we both had the beef curry which was delicious. For dessert, we had Tiramisu which was delightful. The cream was light and the base well soaked ! 
Afterwards we spent the afternoon around the pool
The waiters very very attentive. The only issues we had was that the music was on continuous loop, so after a few hours it was slightly irritating. Also for a 5 star establishment we would have expected that the gin and tonics would come in crystal glasses with lime or lemon. We had to ask for the l&l. I also ordered a tomato juice which came in a crystal glass so it was a little strange 
Overall well worth a visit and we will be back.

29,The True « Palace » of Barcelona,"In France, where I work in a luxury hotel, the category “Palace” is given to those hotels that are really unique, either for their history or for their service or for their architecture. Moreover they have to embody a specific art of hospitality. El Palace was given this name only some years ago, and was formerly the Hotel Ritz Barcelona. Like the other three hotels Ritz in Europe (Madrid, London, Paris) it was built to offer nothing than the best. 100 years later, The hotel is still a concentrate of luxury, elegance and old world class: a true “Palace”. Once you arrive, the doormen and the bellboys are waiting for you (and they are always there) with their beautiful uniforms. The concierges are impeccable with their liveries but they are also very friendly. Same for all the staff. 
Our room was very spacious and elegantly appointed. It had a large walk-in closet and a huge bathroom equipped with a double shower and a separate jacuzzi. Chopard toiletries on top! Everywhere in the room elegant touches, like the beautiful Mondariz water bottles. Housekeeping levels were top notch. Breakfast was superb and again very classy. The manager girl very nice and kind as well as her team. In the evening, the Bluesman bar located in the basement offers nice entertainment with live music. We had a lot of fun and everyone was dancing. we got the impression of being in one of those secret clubs in the 20s reserved only to the happy few! We wanted to try the restaurant L’Eclair and their funny Chalet on the roof but did not have time. Same for the spa.
Last but not least, El Palace offers affordable rates for what you get. In Paris the same style of hotel would cost four times the price. Since I am a passionate of hotels, we had a tour of all the luxury properties in Barcelona (which offer all similar rates to El Palace). To be honest, we did not find anything as nice or luxurious. This is a unique and special place. If you like these Grande Dames properties, you will feel like royalty!",5,2020,03,02
29,Excellent Hotel,"El Palace is a grand hotel full of old-world charm, originally the Ritz Hotel, that is just exceptional. We loved the hotel, all the staff were very friendly and helpful, and our room was very comfortable and had a nice modern bathroom. The restaurant, rooftop bar, and the breakfast venue (especially) were all extremely inviting. Thank you El Palace, we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2020,03,01
29,"Great location, beautiful digs","Wonderfully located, can walk throughout the city; restaurants, shopping, and tourist spots are all close by.  Coming back late at night, went downstairs to hear wonderful live Cuban music in the club.  Staff universally were friendly.  Will not be disappointed.",5,2020,02,29
29,Fantastic stay at El Palace,"We were most impressed with the El Palace. Everyone was so friendly and attended to our every need. Loved our room, the food and social experience. Then location was perfect and allowed us great access to the hot spots in the city! Hope to get back soon!",5,2020,02,24
29,Barcelona's finest,This hotel is pure class and the location is fantastic for exploring Barcelona on foot.  It really deserves 6 stars.  It merges modernity with mid 20th century pure luxury.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else when in Barcelona.,5,2020,02,15
29,Stunning property in the heart of Barcelona !,"A stunning property in the heart of Barcelona . We had a 2 day conference at this property and I must from entering the hotel to leaving the 2nd day, the experience was unforgettable ! The rooms are beautifully decorated and ... have actual keys so this was a flashback to the times when hotels were still places of rest, comfort and service. I am really looking forward to be able to return to El Palace and spend more time there.",5,2020,02,10
29,Amazing hotel!,"Staff, facility an hotel are world class.  Simply amazing!  Decor is classic and the hotel is a 5 star experience.  The room was clean, great view and fully renovated.  Breakfast was excellent with tons of options.",5,2020,02,09
29,Return trip to Barcelona,"Working in (luxury) travel, I am often in 5 star Hotels or on-board 6 star cruise lines and it doesn't matter how beautiful the decor; how amazing is the food; how incredible are the amenities - it counts for nothing if the staff have a bad or snobby attitude. I often encounter the latter and when I do, I take the particular hotel off my list because, if that is the way they treat me, then I can only presume this is how they would treat my clients. Good staff is the key and I thought everyone, without exception, at El Palace was exceptional. From the moment we got out of the taxi, we were made to feel special. I'll be adding a similar review to our company Facebook page which reaches over 450 travel agents in MTA Travel. ",5,2020,02,09
29,"El palace Hotel, Barcelona is the best.",I stayed at El palace in Barcelona for 6 days with my husband.We liked the elegant details which you would see once you enter the hotel.They serve very nice breakfast.There was great service and everyone working there were very friendly and helpful especially Ms.Amal who always welcomed us and advised us when we needed any help.Thankyou for the unforgettable experience.,5,2020,02,07
29,A perfect stay,"This is not a hotel, it is a home from home, everyone is very friendly and helpful, breakfast was excellent and the cleanliness was tip top. The central location was excellent for my business needs and requirements.",5,2020,02,06
29,WONDERFUL,A must for hotel connoisseurs! WONDERFUL stay ! The hotel has its own personality so much history and charm. The staff is magnificent. I was only there 2 days wish I could have stayed longer to check out the restaurants and live entertainment.. I did get to the bar to sample some unusual yet delightful cocktails. ,5,2020,02,02
29,The hotel deserves its high rating,"I spent two nights at the El Palace hotel based on the reviews from TripAdvisor.  Everything was top-notch.  I had an issue with room service, and it was corrected promptly and graciously.  I hope to return to this hotel if I ever return to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,27
29,Great Hotel,We enjoyed our stay at this excellent hotel which boasts great decor. The concierge and reception staff were excellent with great recommendations for restaurants.  Great location to explore  Barcelona.  Highly recommended ,5,2020,01,26
29,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"I stayed 10 nights at the El Palace Hotel.  My room was modern, very comfortable and well furnished.  The bathroom area was spacious and the shower was magnificent.  The temperature control for the room was excellent and the bed was luxurious.  Twice a day good careful housekeeping.  The hotel itself is gorgeous,  There is a rooftop where you can simply get a drink or have a meal overlooking the city area.  The location of the hotel is fabulous because it is near all of the shopping and other venues that a tourist will go to.  The room itself was very quiet and comfortable.  The TV had all the channels you can need when you want to relax after a day of travel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  A good concierge can make your stay run smoothly and I have to say that the staff headed by Francisco was extremely helpful to me.  They had plenty of ideas of where to go and what to see and how to get there.  The night of arrival I received a wonderful bottle of champagne and the night of checkout I received a call from the hotel guest relations inquiring if I needed any special help to get to the airport or if I needed anything else to complete my stay.  There is a piano player at other entertainment at night if you just want to relax in the magnificent lobby and have a drink, snack or even a meal.  The breakfast was sumptuous.  .  So with a great location, staff, and comfortable room, this is definitely the place to stay in Barcelona.  ",5,2020,01,15
29,"Great Combination of Location, Modern convenience, and Old World Sensibility","I hate staying at soulless modern hotels, but am not a big fan of the tired furnishings and lack of conveniences that often go with older hotels.  El Palace was really the best of both worlds.  The exterior and common rooms are of a bygone, more luxurious era.  Yet the place is full of natural light and the hotel room has every convenience you’d want.  Now add that the place is just a couple of blocks from the Plaza Catalonia, and a very short walk from the Gothic area.

Finally, literally every hotel employee we encountered was friendly and super helpful.  I’d specially single out the doormen (always asking if we wanted assistance) and Alexis at the concierge desk (who recommended our favorite restaurant of the trip and also drew out a great walking plan).

If we ever return to Barcelona, we would go back to El Palace in a heartbeat.

",5,2020,01,15
29,Beautiful historic hotel!,"A great stay at this truly lovely hotel with outstanding service, great location and beautiful view from our Juliet balcony in our room. Loved the separate bath and tub.

Really enjoyed our time at this lovingly restored historic hotel!!",5,2020,01,13

29,Elegant hotel,"I stayed here with my mother for three nights. As soon as we arrived at El Palace we knew we were in for a real treat. The doormen always greeted us with a smile, the concierge were pleased to help with directions and advice and nothing was too much trouble. El Palace is a beautiful hotel, with a special ambience. Our room was upgraded to a deluxe city view. The room was spacious with a well designed bathroom including separate large shower and bath tub. We were surprised with a complimentary bottle of champagne which we drank at dinner in L’Éclair restaurant. The food is exquisite and well presented. We had the pleasure of a pianist playing during the evening. If I could give El Palace 6 stars I would and I would thoroughly recommend. ",5,2019,12,16
29,Transported back in time.. in a good way,"We spent three nights at El Palace during our visit to Barcelona.
Its an amazing place! A great contrast between the new and the classic.
Super elegant hotel with all the amenities of modern times.
Service is amazing, location perfect and the staff is super kind.

29,Great hotel,"Great option to visit Barcelona, great service and the rooms are remodeled with great amenities.
The hotel is centered between the main avenues of barcelona, gran via, las ramblas and paseo de gracia.",5,2019,12,04
29,One of Our Favorites,"We stayed at El Palace for several days a little over a month ago. From the front desk onward, the experience was better-than-expected. We did have one problem: The initial room we were given, which was upgraded, was overlooking the main drag. It appears the front of the hotel can get quite a bit of wind and the seal on the multi-glazed window must have been worn (because when we pushed extra hard almost all outside noise disappeared.) 

We let the front desk know, and the next night we were transferred to a suite on the opposite side of the hall - the really quiet side! Management couldn't have been more apologetic.

Beyond that, no quibbles. This hotel is immaculate.",5,2019,11,29
29,The Best,This is a beautiful hotel originally built by The Ritz but is under new management.  Simy said the service was the best I have experienced...any where. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The restaurant also had exceptional service and really delicious food.  The breakfast buffet had everything you could want. This is a magnificent hotel with superb service in a great location. Loved my stay.,5,2019,11,25
29,Exceptional,"Love it, it is a real palace, if only the walls can speak the history!
Breakfast needs some adjustments, for the level of the hotel, breakfast was below expectations.
Definitely will come again and will recommend it to others.",5,2019,11,25
29,Superb Hotel,"This was a short city break for the family. Having done some research we found  El Palace was very central in the city,  and various reviews were good so we booked. That was an excellent decision. The hotel itself is  on one of the main thoroughfares through central Barcelona - although noise levels inside were very low. It is about 10 minutes walk from the central Place de Catalunya  from which many of Barcelona attractions - Las Ramblas, Cathedral etc can be walked to easily. The reception is very plush decorated in the classical style, clean and spacious. Reception staff were very helpful and welcoming , all spoke very good English and the concierges in their immaculate uniforms were all brilliant with information regarding places of interest transport and restaurants. We had two identical rooms for ourselves and adult offspring. They were overlooking the front of the hotel, but as mentioned before very quiet. The rooms were again well decorated comfortable with high standard bathrooms. The decor was in good condition and rooms were very well cleaned. The showers were spacious and had either overhead or hand held options, with easily managed controls. TV';s were situated behind mirrors which appears to becoming commonplace around Europe in the better quality. The beds themselves were brilliant - huge double bed in ours - exceptionally comfortable - to our tastes anyway - 3 single beds in the kids rooms all excellent. Plugs with phone charge sockets were available in the rooms - real plus these days.
There were several bars , roof, cocktail, and lounge - where service was very good - prices were not cheap but not ridiculous either. Breakfast was served in a wonderful high ceilinged room, very well set out and quality of the food especially cold buffet was excellent.Again service in restaurant and in bars was very good. So - downsides - only a couple of really minor things  we were amazingly e-mailed couple of days before our arrival - asking what times we wanted room service in day and evening - I asked for after 10.30 in mornings - which obviously happened well, and after 20.00 in evenings when we would be out for dinner- every night we had a little card pushed under door saying as we didnt want to be disturbed room service had been and gone and we should ring if required - so request was missed here - not sure if anyone did actually knock on door at all. Also - hotel of this quality should be cooking the hot breakfasts to order -scrambled egg and crispy bacon does not do well in a warmer. Finally the baths could be bigger - I'm 6' and only just squeezed in - son is 6'4 and he really struggled. Notwithstanding these minor criticisms - this is an outstanding hotel, value is very good and  we will certainly use it again when in Barcelona.",5,2019,11,24
29,Could have stayed longer,"Very nice place to stay. Celebrating their 100 year old is like taking you back to the old times. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are clean. Location wise is good as it is walking distance to the Plaza and the Arc. Javier is very welcoming, ready do greet you with a friendly smile.",5,2019,11,24
29,"El Palace Hotel,Barcelona","As usual, our stay was an exceptional experience.  This hotel is one of our favorites worldwide. All services provided were above average and  provided by the cheerful, helpful staff.  The quality of the room was superior to others in the area.",5,2019,11,23
29,A spectacular property with a superb staff,"I have stayed in excellent hotels in at least 20 countries.  This was one of the finest hotels I have found, and the staff was absolutely tremendous.  A genuine pleasure to stay there.  We will certainly return.",5,2019,11,23
29,Actually rating the Restaurant Inside this First Class Hotel,"Restaurant very good to excellent, could eat early dinner which was decided plus as a tourist and quality very good to excellent.  Very good service, table setting etc. restaurnt is in back of hotel as you enter front entrance   first class decor   we ate dinner there but were staying in much samller  hotel Cotton House around the corner.",4,2019,11,21
29,Great,"We have stayed 3 persons in a classic room for 3 nights and it was very comfortable. The hotel has very good service, everyone was very helpful and friendly. Also the hotel has great location in city center,  5 min walk to shopping areas.",5,2019,11,21
29,After Curise,"This is a WOW Hotel. Pure class as you step into this hotel and allow history and luxury to wrap their arms around you. As you move thru the ballroom it just gets better and better. The breakfast area, upstairs pool with bar and lunch seating. The scenery and views are stunning. Treat yourself and enjoy a most memorable palace, you won't be disappointed. Darrell  ",5,2019,11,21
29,Classy Hotel in a Beautiful City,"I highly recommend staying at the El Palace in Barcelona. The staff were courteous, friendly, professional and always tried to help. We stayed in room 311, it was beautifully decorated, spacious and clean.

The hotel is walking distance to the gay area. My domestic partner and I went on this trip to celebrate our fifteenth anniversary. Although, this is not a gay hotel, we felt welcomed and accepted.

The breakfast restaurant was a real treat with a wide variety of food choices. The service in the breakfast room was friendly, professional and classy. It was always a great way to start the day.

The blues bar in the lower level of the hotel was a nice place to unwind with a well executed classic martini. 

Overall, you cannot go wrong staying at the El Palace if you plan to visit Barcelona.",4,2019,11,16
29,A 'grand dame' for sure!,"This is inarguably a super posh, beautiful hotel, with all that entails: fancy decor, what seems like about 5,000 doormen, an actual room key with a tassel that you leave with a keeper each time you go out. It is just off the big name shopping street - Rolex, Tiffany, etc, and close to some of the Gaudi buildings as well. Rooms are large with lots of storage, bathrooms HUGE and well-appointed and the breakfast buffet (included in our room fare, but I don't know if that's always the case) fabulous and extensive. All this said, if your style is more like mine where you prefer the lowkey atmosphere and the quirky, unique boutiques of the old town, or want to be closer to the port/water area, this would be a little far for walking regularly.",5,2019,11,16
29,Finally a 5 star hotel in Spain ,"We stay in 5 star hotels in Spain in different areas and are always disappointed as they are at best 4 star , not here this is five star by far the best hotel we have stayed in any where in Spain . The hotel is absolutely fabulous the decor in all areas is fantastic, the room amazing tv in mirror spacious room beautiful decor bathroom amazing bed comfy didn’t want to leave the room . Food  delicious and priced reasonably breakfast room beautiful and again excellent quality and reasonably priced we will probably only stay here when in Barcelona, a must if your up there , also staff were all professional and service was excellent.thank you all very much for a fantastic experience.",5,2019,11,15
29,Great Hotel,"This is a very beautiful hotel in a great location.  The hotel has some really cool architecture, not like cookie cutter places being built now. The concierges are super helpful with dinner recommendations and booking anything you need.  Highly recommend, all around a great experience. ",5,2019,11,14
29,The best hotel in barcelona!,"We were happy from the entrance to the hotel.  All the staff were mannerful, kind and luxurious.  It was a shame that I only had to stay at this hotel for 3 days.  One thing that is unfortunate is that there was no toothbrush in the room amenities.  All other services were satisfactory.  Thank you for helping make our trip to Barcelona enjoyable.  The next time we travel to Barcelona, ​​we will definitely choose El Palace.",5,2019,11,13
29,Exceptional,"Recently returned from a weekend at El Palace to celebrate our wedding anniversary. What an absolute gem of a hotel if you are visiting Barcelona. The hotel is beautifully decorated and all the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The rooms are serviced daily and immaculately clean. The cocktail bar is a must and the food and wine of such a high standard. I would strongly recommend the El Palace as it provides a level of opulence at excellent value for money. Exceptional, you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,11,13
29,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is a must!! The decor, rooms, food and especially the staff are all top notch!  The location was great, many good restaurants nearby too.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.  Can't wait to return!  ",5,2019,11,10

We were looked after very professionally yet in a friendly manner,  The hotel has been superbly  refurbished but retains all of its past glory.  All super clean and well appointed with stunning bathroom.  An extremely comfortable
bed for a very relaxed night.
A special breakfast is served in their exquisite dining room.  We also had dinner on their rooftop terrace which was very pleasant.  We highly recommend this lovely hotel in a great location.  Yveline Quinn",5,2019,11,04
29,Outstanding El Palace,"On a scale of 0-5, the overall rating is a 10 !!!
I could not have been more pleased with our stay.  I was staying with a friend and of course I wanted everything to go well.  In short, the hotel, facilities, and STAFF was fantastic. I will only stay at the El Palace in the future when I return to Barcelona !!!",5,2019,10,29
29,Excellent!,This was our first trip to Barcelona and from arrival to departure the hotel and its staff created a lasting impression that this was one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. The concierge service made precise and excellent recommendations. The grand corridor leading to the lower level restaurant was magnificent and the roof top bar and restaurant were spectacular. Truly a fantastic hotel1,5,2019,10,29
29,Wonderful stay!,"We were very happy to have found this gem.  The hotel is in a fantastic location, the service was wonderful and the property is so top notch!  We enjoyed the roof top pool and restaurant.  What a VIEW!  If our travels take us back to Barcelona (and I hope they do), we will definitely be looking to stay here again.",5,2019,10,26
29,Beautiful,We like traditional european style hotels and this was it. Used to be the Ritz until 1993. Beautiful hall furnished in Louis 14th style with large chandeliers. Service is great. Room was beautiful with expansive bathroom. Have a pillow menu which is fantastic for my wife as she has had neck surgery so needs a firm pillow. Still have old style keys you leave at the front when you go out. Small nice restaurant with piano player at night. The bar has dark wood but only serves cocktails so we opted to have some bites and wines in the a hall sofa. Would stay here again if we come back to Barcelona.,5,2019,10,24
29,Luxurious and grand but not stuffy,"What a gorgeous hotel! Don’t be put off by the elegant uniforms worn by the staff - this hotel is not stuffy and you will feel right at home. The location can’t be beat - we walked to everything. Do NOT miss the rooftop bar, next to the pool. We spent hours there drinking wine one sunny day and it was sheer heaven. The view of La Sagrada from the roof gives new perspective on how big it is and we got some great photos up there. Can’t wait to stay again. ",5,2019,10,23
29,Classic Luxury,"El Palace is a grand hotel and totally lives up to its reputation.  We enjoyed our stay, and felt very much at home. Each time we returned we were warmly greeted by the staff. The front desk and concierge staff were first class and the latter recommended several good restaurants for us and of course gave us tips on where to shop and how to get wherever we needed to go. I corresponded with them even before arrival to arrange airport transportation and restaurant reservations and their replies were always prompt and courteous.
Our rooms all overlooked the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, and the hotel is perfectly located close to the main shopping street Paseo de Gracia, and it was only a short walk to La Rambla and other landmarks, as well as numerous restaurants. The hotel is decorated in a classic traditional style- a lovely lobby and dining area, (we actually had a light breakfast there on the day of arrival while waiting for our rooms to be ready, attended to by a very pleasant maître d), and the rooms are in the same style, but updated with modern bathroom fixtures. The breakfast buffet was very extensive and very good, and served in a beautiful atrium surrounded by plants. We also had lunch on the upstairs terrace which was also lovely, but only a few patrons the day we went. Drinks were very expensive there so not sure whether this had something to do with it.

Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Great spa treatments also.",5,2019,10,10
29,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel was well located, and was really beautiful. Our room was very large and very comfortable. The bathroom is extremely large. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,10,09
29,A True Palace,"The El Palace Hotel is a true palace. Our room was spectacular, the food was excellent. Make it a point to go to the rooftop for one of the best views of the city. Truly amazing. Visit the bar for great music at night. ",5,2019,10,08
29,Old World Charm and wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff are impeccable!  Everything is fabulous from the morning breakfast buffet to the top of the building bar and tapas - not to mention the views, to the wonderfully prepared food in the dining restaurant.  We had a tremendous stay and will be back to El Palace Hotel!  ",5,2019,10,07
29,Top class hotel ,"Stayed here for 3 nights, very impressed with this hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are spacious bed was very comfortable. Had dinner one of the night on roof top, food was great only improvement I would suggest is that was too dark were we sat to see what we were eating even with three lights on our table!. Enjoyed our stay here very much.",5,2019,10,05
29,Return Visit,"My family and I visited a few years ago and decided to return with a group of ten friends.The staff did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful and offers the type of gracious service that unfortunately, is now very difficult to experience. Service is absolutely unsurpassed, rooms are immaculate, and all requests are answered in a matter of minutes. This included several requests for ice to nurse a sore foot. Securing multiple taxis and providing destinations to the drivers was much appreciated. Staff took personal interest in our group recognizing our lack of Spanish and assisted us in every way possible. They followed up repeatedly with the airlines and were very helpful in securing some lost luggage. A complimentary birthday treat for a member of our group was a wonderful surprise and greatly appreciated. Stayed at some of the best hotels in the past, both in Europe and the U.S., but this will remain my favorite!

29,A jewel in Barcelona,Our stay at the El Palace hotel was an outstanding experience. The hotel and rooms are beautifully furnished and it is centrally located for visiting the cities highlights.   The rooms were spacious and serviced well  The concierge provided great service and access to the best restaurants ,5,2019,09,29
29,Wonderful Hotel,"Recently we visited Barcelona and we stayed at the El Palace. The place is beautiful filled with grand old world charm. Absolutely magnificent and truly lives up to its name as a palace. The rooms are very clean, well thought out and very comfortable with a huge flat screen TV (Hubby was very happy with this one). The staff are all extremely well trained, discreet, friendly and helpful. It is definitely a hotel I would strongly recommend to anyone wanting to be pampered.

I would especially like to thank a very helpful waiter at the cafe. Sadly I was not feeling well when we arrived at the hotel on the first day. Unfortunately as we landed really early our room was not ready so we decided to find a quiet discreet corner of the cafe and try to rest. This waiter not only made me feel welcome and comfortable even though I'm quite sure the hotel would not really appreciate a half dead looking guest, he made the extra effort to speak with the kitchen asked them for some lovely chicken consomme so I could settle my angry tummy. I'm really sorry I didn't get his name and I didn't see him again for the rest of my visit. I do hope the management of the hotel will make an effort to find him and thank him for me.",5,2019,09,29
29,Exceptional hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the avienda palace in Barcelona.  The location was great.  Staff was wonderful.  They even upgraded us to a junior suite.  Bathroom was amazing.  We loved the pool on the roof so nice to soak in and very warm.  The breakfast was delicious with many choices, but there bread was amazing.  We will definitely be back.",5,2019,09,26
29,Spectacular Hotel....,"We recently returned from a three night stay at this hotel and can only describe it as spectacular. The hotel is old world European style - very grand! The grand room just through the lobby is absolutely beautiful and a great place to just sit and relax or enjoy a nice cocktail while listening to the piano player. We also experienced the Bluesman Bar downstairs and it was a very cool place! The rooftop pool, bar and restaurant is great and not to be missed. Our room was very nice and spacious with great views of the city. The service was top notch! Lastly, the location of this hotel was spot on and allowed us to easily see the sites and walk to many of them. We were so impressed by this property and would absolutely recommend it!",5,2019,09,26
29,The best,"This is the best of the best in Barcelona. It used to be The Ritz, and it’s absolutely stunning. Totally restored, without losing any of its grandeur. It seems Paris in Catalunya. The staff is really well prepared and extraordinarily efficient and kind. Breakfast is amazing. The rooms are very spacious and luxurious. The rooftop garden with its restaurants and the pool are really a must. Very well located in the most elegant neighbourhood, steps from Passeij de Gràcia. One of the bests of Spain.",5,2019,09,25
29,Very Special Place,"'the Palace Hotel is a beautiful historic but modern hotel. The location is great, the atmosphere is perfect, the service is outstanding and the food is delicious. Bonus treat: the Blues Bar on the lower level is absolutely gorgeous with a Rolling Stones connection. Uniquely, there is a cigar room next to a private room for smoking them. The cigar smoke does not enter the bar. Don't miss the rooftop restaurant, pool and observation deck.
Great staff.",5,2019,09,23
29,Excellent Place ,Great Hotel staff very helpful and a great location. We had dinner here as well in the roof top restaurant and after we went for drinks in the cocktail bar downstair. Will definitely be booking again soon ,5,2019,09,23
29,An elegant property with superb service,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels in which I’ve ever stayed. The service was also awesome..the staff went out of their way to help me when, mysteriously, two local atm machines declined to release euros against my bank card 
As it was a Sunday, I was a bit concerned about having to navigate the day without any cash!
After an hour of unsuccessfully trying to communicate with my bank card, the concierge suggested I take a cash advance against my room. Problem solved for the day! 
Our room was gorgeous and extremely comfortable.
The rooftop setup is wonderful, with one of Barcelona’s largest pools and with great views
Over the city.
We had the pleasure of dining at the hotel’s principal restaurant. Our meal was outstanding.
The location was convenient to many of Barcelona’s attractions.
Bottom line, it was truly a gift to have had the opportunity to stay at El Palacio.

29,Concierge,"Solid classic luxury. Modern facilities. Top location. 
If you are a bit Barcelona design ‘all look the same’ tiered, you may like this hotel with old fashioned service, provided by caring well trained staff. 
Outstanding concierge. Most prominent position in the hotel, the staff makes your stay. Concierge as it is supposed to be but can be rarely found. 

Only three suggestions which would make our stay perfect. 
No-smoking at the breakfast patio; no-smoking under the entrance roof; music more suitable to this hotel at breakfast and the pool (why the same (too loud) music as in so many hotels?); we would like the choice of music to enhance the classic positioning by playing local, classic and/or, easy listening music or even rather nothing at all.",5,2019,09,19
29,Dripping in Luxury,"One of the finest hotels in Europe. HUGE bathrooms, large bedrooms....fit for royalty. My only issue was the lack of USB ports and extra outlets , which is a must-have in today’s world. However, It still remains my number one choice in Barcelona. Great area, few tourist crowds and a fabulous bar/restaurant atop the building, with magnificently viewers. Breakfast buffet is beyond imagination although pricier than most breakfast buffets. And this one even included Dim Sum. WOW!",5,2019,09,17
29,Absolutely fantastic,"We really enjoyed our stay in this gorgeous heritage property. Nothing was too much trouble.  The roof terrace, restaurant and swimming pool was gorgeous. The views were amazing!  Would go again with no hesitation!",5,2019,09,13
29,Felt like a King in Barcelona ,"I discovered this Hotel as part of the Grand Luxury Hotrl group, and was looking forward to spending time here as well as the Maria Christina in San Sebastián. 

But wow! This place is luxury with a capital L. Besides wowing you as soon as you walk through the grand entrance, the staff as amazing and their attention to detail is spectacular. From the gentleman at checking, through to the bellman and was greeted by the assistant manager before being walked personally to my room, and explained every detail of it. 

The food is superb as well as the roof top bar and swimming pool. Spent a relaxing afternoon up there, cooling off whilst taking in a few rays....

It is situated on the main shopping strip, surrounded by luxury, high end stores as well as popular everyday brands. There are vibrant restaurants close by as well as the famed La Rambla. Everything is walking distance. 

I can’t not rate this hotel high enough, it’s a shame I can only give it 5 stars 🌟.
If you can stay there, please do, you won’t be disappointed. ",5,2019,09,13

The hotel is a beautiful olde world establishment, immaculately decorated and a visual treat. The rooms are spacious and the very epitome of luxury, spotlessly clean with every amenity catered for. The turn down service ensured that room remained immaculate. All service, from the check in and porters to the breakfast staff is of the highest order. Thank you for an unforgettable stay.",5,2019,09,08
29,50th Birthday,"Best Hotel I have ever been to.The moment I received a email prior to my arrival asking what temperature I'd like the room to be at , I guessed I was in for a good time. 
The moment you arrive,the staff are second to none. The reception is so welcoming,professional and upper class, so much care to detail. The hotel is immaculate...clean beyond belief and so well presented.  I challenge anyone staying to fine a finger print, smudge etc on the inside of the mirror, brass interior of the lifts !!.... The classic standard room I stayed in was much more more than expected , huge bed , great en suite and so well decorated.
Located in such a great area adds to the overall pleasure. I stayed in Cardiffs 5star ? Hotel ,st David's hotel on the bay ( voco) before coming here....no where near as good!.coming back in May and for many years to come hopefully.  First class .
Couple of small, very small points , could so with more coffee and milk in room , and price of drinks on the roof terrace, albeit a fabulous terrace,are 3 times the average cost in bars locally , typical hotel bar.

Come stay !!!",5,2019,09,07

29,Salvador Dali was in the next room. ,"We (three friends) stayed at the Hotel Ritz is 1969 and asked for adjoining rooms, but were told that was not possible. So we were given two rooms next to a central room facing the elevator. The next morning, while waiting for the elevator, the door to the central room opened and Salvador Dali emerged, followed by his wife  Gala. He greeted us with “Good Morning” and did so again the next two mornings. What a great memory. ",5,2019,09,01

Will return in a heartbeat.  Thankyou!",5,2019,08,30
29,Excellent ,"We enjoyed our stay in this luxurious hotel. Everything started few days after booking my stay with my family. I requested 2 adjacent rooms and a crib and was granted fairly quickly.
Few days before received an email asking for any special request and what time was planning to check in in case I arrive early so they could accommodate you.
At our arrival, we all were greeted by the staff. We talked about Barcelona.
Our room was outstanding spacious for all of us( we were five, my wife, my 16,7,2 yo
Children and me)
They placed cute teddy bears for my children. They loved them.
We ordered warmth milk for my little one everyday and had amazing sangrias in our room.
We enjoyed the pool in the terrace and had good tapas there. All good quality products.
Our last day, we had breakfast in our room and because of my daughter 17 yo birthday they place a small cake with a candle.
We would be back if we are in Barcelona again!",5,2019,08,28
29,Excellent,"The hotel common areas and rooms are clean, spacious, and luxurious as you’d expect at this price point and the service is outstanding. The staff are very attentive and ever present for whatever you need, whenever you need it. Marat, at the front desk/concierge in particular was extremely helpful and informative. Whether it be directions, a taxi, a restaurant recommendation, or anything thing else we needed he was our go to man. He’s very friendly, informative, and always went an extra mile to make sure our stay in the hotel and the city in general was as comfortable an enjoyable as possible. The entire el palace team was amazing but I have to highlight Marat in particular. We’ll certainly be coming back to visit Barcelona and this hotel.",5,2019,08,27
29,Elegance Beyond Words,"El Palace Hotel in Barcelona is exquisite. This historic hotel turns 100 years old this year and they’ve done a marvelous job with the upkeep of all the historical details. The architecture of the building is beautiful but what really takes your breath away is when you walk in! Wow! High ceilings, marvel floors, gold trimming, brass rails...it’s just like you walked back into time. Everyone that works here has been outstanding! The customer service is beyond words and they literally treat you like royalty. The food here is delicious and they have some of the best handcrafted cocktails. I recommend you go upstairs to their rooftop bar and have a nightcap and take in the gorgeous views of this beautiful city! Barcelona, we love you! And we HIGHLY recommend El Palace Hotel! ",5,2019,08,25
29,"Service, elegance and comfort reign at El Palace!","It is with the greatest pleasure that I submit this review of El Palace Hotel in Barcelona. My partner and I spent two beautiful weeks in Barcelona in July of this year (July 3 - 15).  After considerable research on the many lovely hotels Barcelona has to offer, we settled on El Palace. I am certain that our decision was the best one we could possibly have made because the Palace exceeded our expectations in so many ways.  It’s hard tobegin this review because there are so many wonderful things to say about this beautiful, grand hotel.

Our flight from Toronto arrived mid-morning so when we arrived at the hotel, our room was understandably not ready. After check-in we waited in the stunningly beautiful lobby lounge for two hours. We had a nice lunch and relaxed as we anticipated what the rest of this hotel was going to offer us. Based on the lounge in the lobby alone, we knew we were in for a grand treat.

The hotel was celebrating its centenary anniversary.  It was originally a Ritz Carlton built in 1919 and still exudes that over the top elegance that one would expect from a hotel of that calibre. You would be hard-pressed to find another hotel in Barcelona, in fact anywhere in Spain, which matches the quiet elegance of the Palace

We were in room 311. The room was incredibly well appointed and larger than most hotel rooms. The bathroom alone was massive. The room had a fully stocked mini bar at prices that were actually quite reasonable. The bathroom amenities were luxurious from the shower soap right through to the towels, slippers and bathrobes. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. It really felt like home away from home. 

When we arrived, we were surprised with the lovely bottle of chilled cava as a welcome gift. We were celebrating our 15th anniversary and they made special note of that. Throughout our two week stay we would arrive after turn down service to find on occasion, fruit trays and chocolates which was quite a lovely surprise.  We received personalized letters welcoming us to the hotel from the general manager and we really felt that was a lovely personalized touch.

The hotel itself as I mentioned earlier, is grand in scale and decor. When you entered the building, you really felt like you were in a palace. But it is the amenities of the hotel that really pushed the hotel into a class all its own. We began each day with the buffet breakfast. What an amazing breakfast it was. There were several stations with everything you could possibly imagine for breakfast including eggs made to order right through to yoghurts, breads, sweets, fruit, sausages, bacon, salmon and a myriad of other international foods. And of course, mimosas made with Spain’s famous cava!   It was the grandest way to start our day and we felt incredibly welcomed by the staff of the breakfast room.

The rooftop swimming pool and bar was also very nice in that it provided us a bit of respite from the heat of Barcelona. The pool, while a little bit on the small side, certainly kept us refreshed. Poolside service for refreshments was quick and friendly. And the bar itself on the rooftop was very lovely for midafternoon cocktails surrounded by luxurious plants.  There is also a small rooftop garden that I discovered where they grow herbs for the bar and the restaurants.  I thought that was really neat!

I did not check out the gym facilities. I can’t comment on that but I can only imagine that the gym would be just as well appointed as the rest of the hotel. We did however on a few occasions, go to the Bluesman Bar in the basement of the hotel. What a gem! The Rolling Stones have actually played in this very intimate venue. The style of this bar is very 1920s era chic and it was an ideal place to relax over a martini after a day of sightseeing. It was definitely a highlight with live music on weekends!

On purpose, I am saving my comments about the staff of El Palace to the very end of my review. There are so many people that deserve mentions.  Indeed, every single person that we encountered from the cleaning staff to the concierge deserves the highest praise.  However, a few people stand out and I need to mention them personally here.  I begin with Nouria in the breakfast room. I can only describe her as dedicated to her job in a way that made me look forward to seeing her every morning.   She would engage in light conversation as she seated us at our table, ask us about our daily plans, recommend certain little known things to see, and was just an all-around joy to chat with. All of her colleagues in the breakfast room were equally delightful. 

In the Bluesman Bar which I mentioned previously, you will find the effervescent Coco behind the bar. Beside her amazing ability to make the best martini you can find in Barcelona, Coco displays a friendliness and love of her job and her customers that made me want to go to the bar every evening just to see her. She keeps her customers engaged and makes everyone feel incredibly welcome.  It’s almost like you stepped inside her own living room!  Well done, Coco!

Lastly, the front desk staff:  Everyone who worked the concierge’s desk displayed a professionalism and warm friendliness that one would expect from this calibre of hotel. I would like to single out Alexis, however.  What an absolute joy this man was to deal with!  He was friendly, with a delightful sense of humour yet displayed that amazingly calm professional demeanour that made me want to chat with him for hours.  He showed great enthusiasm for his city, and even more enthusiasm for the hotel and its clientele.  He told me that he loves his job because of the people that he serves.  And I really believe him.  I never got a chance to say goodbye to him when we left but kudos to the palace for having such a wonderful warm person to greet people every morning.  There are numerous other staff people who deserve commendation but my review would be endless if I named them all.

Barcelona is a beautiful city. El Palace is the jewel of hotels in that city. I would not consider any other hotel if I were lucky enough to visit the beautiful city of Barcelona again. El Palace gets my absolute highest recommendation.  Congratulations!

29,"Luxurious, grand hotel in heart of Barcelona ","Our family enjoyed a wonderful stay at El Palace. The staff all around the hotel are so friendly and knowledgeable and attentive. The lobby and common areas are beautiful and opulent. The rooms are spacious and clean and comfortable and in keeping with old, grand hotel. The rooftop is amazing with great views and a nice pool. Only wish the pool was open a little later in the evening, something to keep in mind when you come back from long day of sightseeing in summer heat. Breakfast was delicious and varied. Loved the location!",5,2019,08,13
29,Mayan Spa Experience,"I stayed at The Cotton House Hotel next door and they partner with Palace Hotel for spa services. I had a massage at the Mayan spa the day after arriving in Barcelona just to unwind and de-stress, and wow, was I impressed. The 30 minutes of steam before the massage in the authentic Mayan steam room was seriously amazing. I don't usually like steam rooms, but this one was so different and enjoyable that I ended up spending the whole 30 minutes decompressing. Now, the massage itself was seriously wonderful. I got a full-body massage (I can't remember the name of my masseuse!) and it was honestly one of the best massages I've ever had in my life. I left feeling refreshed and happy. Everyone who works in the Mayan Spa was kind and so, so friendly. I wanted to go back for a facial but there was just no time!",5,2019,08,07
29,Return visit,"I recently spent six nights here with my daughter having previously stayed seven years ago!  I had always hoped to stay here on my return and I was not disappointed.  The hotel is just lovely, very elegant and grand but not stuffy in the least.  The members of staff are all so helpful, and although I didn’t manage to note everyone’s name, I do know that Alexus- hope I’ve spelled that correctly- was wonderful in helping us out with an issue we had with our travel arrangements.  Thank you so much.
We felt completely relaxed here and totally pampered. I’m hoping it won’t take me another seven years before I can get back.",5,2019,08,03
29,Amazing 3 nights in Barcelona ,"Our family of .5 enjoyed our 2 beautiful connecting rooms at the El Palace Hotel.  The service was outstanding, from the doormen and valets to reception, concierge, and housekeeping.  We also met the wonderful general manager and learned a lot about the 100 year history of this original Ritz property.  We had fun, memorable experiences in Barcelona and are happy to highly recommend the El Palace hotel.",5,2019,08,02
29,Wonderful hotel,"This was our second time staying at this amazing hotel, i am pleased to say that this visit was just as fantastic as our first last year. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are amazing and a real credit to the hotel. It was great to see a lot of the same staff there a year on, which in my opinion would indicate the hotel looks after the staff as well as the guests. Thank you El Palace for another wonderful weekend.",5,2019,07,30
29,Superb hotel and great location,"Loved everything about this hotel. The staff are amazing extremely helpful and courteous definitely made me feel like royalty. The interior of the hotel is magical, beautiful and charming. Rooms are clean and comfortable with a fabulous shower.   Rooftop bar has some fabulous views well worth a visit. I enjoyed chilling up there with a refreshing cocktail.  Location of hotel is ideal we walked everywhere as we love to walk but if that’s not you Taxi’s are located outside hotel or the amazing concierge team can organize one for you.  Can’t wait to return ",5,2019,07,30
29,TOP CLASS,"We recently visited El Palace on a trip from Australia, having been disappointed in our hotel, on one of the islands, this really made up for it.
From the minute you walk through the door, everything is amazing, concierge, check in were great really fast.
We had a suite, it was fit for a king, this is immaculate 5* all the way, everything is beautiful, we could not fault the hotel, there is a Cocktail Lounge in the basement, it’s really really nice, with great live music , Thursday, Friday, Saturday, nights, a big shout for Coco, she makes a keen Cocktail, and is great at her job, the rooftop bar is also really good, the pool is also really good, my only fault was that we were never offered drinks, at the pool on the 3 days that we visited it, and staff were slow to move old towels, it looked as though a manager was doing that on one occasion.
However that was only a tiny thing, we would highly recommended El Palace and love to return thank you",5,2019,07,26
29,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful, elegant hotel.  English, if that's your language is widely used.  Heads up on the buffet breakfast....we entered buffet area were told that since our name was on their list that breakfast was included.  It was NOT and is 30 Euros per person.  Just be aware, but it's a wonderful buffet. 

Also lack of recharging plugs near the beds.  Plenty in the bathrooms.  We also had shards of glass in our carpet from a glass that must have been broken by a previous user.  Wear the slippers that they provide!

Enjoy Barcelona.  Absolutely a gem of a city!",4,2019,07,25
29,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel with great service! 
El Palace is beautiful historical building
Rooftop garden of the hotel is amazing.
Very nice location as well! Near to museums and churches.
We will come again! Thank You!",5,2019,07,21
29,Nothing beats a classic elegant hotel experience,"Our visit started when we arrived at the hotel at 11 AM, and amazingly, our room was ready.  Considering that we had reserved connecting rooms, I expected this to be difficult for the hotel, but hey even got the room ready for our son who arrived 2 hours later.  The staff were exteremly friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  They gave helful suggestions for restaurants and Flamenco, booked the reservations and were all just a pleasure.

I'd also ad that if you are not sure where to visit in Eurpoe, Barcelona is a winner!
The location is perfect, shoppping within a block, and taxis waiting every time.  We swam in the rooftop pool, had drinks and even ate there.  Everyone we met was just as chariming and friendly.  The room was large and bathroom modern. We definitely will be back.",5,2019,07,21
29,One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at 5* all the way!!,"El Palace is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. The room was crystal clean, spacious with some of the most friendly and helpful staff. When we were trying to take our bags to and from the hotel, we were swarmed with multiple staff assisting us. After arriving from the United States, we needed a nice shower and that might have been one of the highlights of the experience.  Breakfast was overall very good with a lot of options and a terrific cappuccino to start off the day. The hotel is located in a central area near the Paseo de Gracia and many sites. It is a bit of a walk to the barceloneta / waterfront area but very walkable - we walked over Barcelona vs. taking the metro or taxis. The only complaint I would provide (if any) was the lack of outlets that in today's connected world are needed. The hotel should just invest in a power strip at each of the bedside night stands. I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2019,07,16
29,Treated like a King and Queen in a spectacular castle in a bygone era.,"Impeccable staff, amenities, and service, and seeped  in splendor in a fantasy world. Great location and superior quality.  Premier property and outstanding in almost every way one can imagine. Our every need, wish, and desire was their command.",5,2019,07,15
29,The elegant hotel,I went several times to have the afternoon tea there but I didn’t have the chance to enjoy the stay there or experience it. But when I went last April I couldn’t resist booking a room that I really thought it was a mini suite in which it was a room that had a dressing room a view that is so refreshing to my eyes . The hotel really tried their best to make us happy and never hesitate to help us if we need . The had the best view in the restaurant up on the rooftop . It was so romantic and cosy place to have dinner . I enjoyed my stay there a lot it’s a historic fine hotel . It is highly recommended for couples and family where you can feel the warm smile when ever you pass the staff every time.,5,2019,07,14
29,A Perfect Stay,We arrived at El Palace in the morning and were greeted by the lovely Reception Team who made us feel like home. Our Room was a true delight with the most fabulous shower I have ever seen. At El Palace nothing is too much to ask for. The lovely Alexis at Concierge was a dream when recommending us different attractions. I would recommend to have breakfast at El Palace - the buffet is a dream come true and it will set you off perfectly for the day. My personal highlight was the beautiful Rooftop Terrace / Pool - a true gem in the middle of Barcelona but you feel like on Cloud 9. El Palace - we will definitely be back.,5,2019,07,13
29,In the heart of Barcelona.,"This was a wonderful hotel with old fashioned values and made us feel really welcome.  The beds were excellent and the breakfasts memorable.
The location was ideal being very central and within walking distance of the Metro, shops and restaurants.",5,2019,07,11
29,Outstanding experience!,"We live in Barcelona and after celebrating my birthday we decided to book the room with my husband for post bday rest, unbelievable hotel with top service and opulent suroundings! 
Stayed in one of the suites that was amazing! Will return for more experiences, no doubt! Highly recommended!  ",5,2019,07,06
29,Worthy of every one of their 5 stars,"What a fabulous hotel! We had a wonderful stay at this property. We stayed for one night on Saturday 29th June. In advance of our arrival we were assisted to make restaurant and bar reservations and we received wonderful service from Fatima. The room was beautiful and we were kindly provided a bottle of cava and chocolates which we were a very welcome touch! The swimming pool was glorious and with the weather being so hot we spent most of our time there. The L’Eclair restaurant was very nice and we had a very enjoyable 3 course meal with wine. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. Our only (very minor) suggestion is to put a full length mirror, or as a minimum, a table top mirror in the main bedroom, as there is no where for ladies to do their make up in the bedroom. We will absolutely return and thank you for a truly magical stay. ",5,2019,07,02
29,Excellent Stay,"Excellent! Quiet but within 10 minutes walking from Las Ramblas. Amazing rooftop pool and bar. Free sunscreen, planet of towels. Beautiful outside/indoor restaurants.This review should not require 200 letters to complete.",5,2019,07,01
29,A Perfect Stay,"If you are visiting Barcelona, El Palace is without any doubt the Hotel you want to stay at! The location is perfect, the rooms are very spacious, the staff always ready to help (a special thank you to Alexis at the concierge desk for helping us planning our sightseeing. You truly deliver a 5 stars service!!!). Their breakfast is fantastic and the perfect way to start your day, really unmissable. The swimming pool and the terrace are  the perfect places to escape the summer heath for a few hours, enjoying a refreshing and perfectly executed drink. We can't wait to be back, thank you for a perfect stay!",5,2019,07,01
29,So comfortable and easy ...,"We had a spacious room, especially for Europe, centrally located.  The concierge was extraordinary -- helpful with everything from restaurant reservations to beach recommendations and towels.  The kitchen does an fantastic job with the food and the roof terrace and pool are an amazing way to relax at the end of the day.  This original Ritz hotel was so good, it makes other other perfectly nice hotels seem inferior.  ",5,2019,06,30
29,Old World Splendor,"Stepping into the El Palace is a flashback to an older world of grand hotel elegance. Celebrating 100 years we should have arrived with top hat and trunks of luggage rather than dressed in jeans and carry-on suitcase. It did not matter as the staff was friendly and welcoming.

Our junior suite did face an adjoining wall but it provided privacy and quiet which is a priority. If we wanted a view we went up to the rooftop bar which we did every night.

The concierge service was so helpful in navigating the Barcelona sights and making restaurant reservations in a busy city. Alexis at the desk was super helpful and represented the Le Clef d'Or perfectly.

On my birthday the GM wrote a nice note along with the cake and Cava my wife ordered.

Tip: order the full breakfast room service and receive a delicious, over the top amount of food. The pastries and baked goods are as fine as the best bakeries in Barcelona. We stayed 5 nights and again 1 night as we traveled home.

The El Palace is highly recommended.",5,2019,06,29
29,Great Views of Barcelona,"While I didnt stay at El Palace Hotel I went to there because I heard about their rooftop bar.  AND it did not disappoint.  El Palace has the best 360 view of Barcelona! In addition, the service was excellent.",5,2019,06,24
29,Absolutely amazing,"So elegant and amazing customer service,at the check in the guy upgraded us to a junior suite without even asking him for an upgrade,such a wonderful surprise,wish all the hotels would do that 😉
The rooftop pool with panoramic views of the city was amazing as well,such a classy and elegant hotel,it’s hard to leave.

",5,2019,06,22
29,Romantic stay in beautiful hotel,I had not appreciated that this hotel was actually the Ritz in a former life which explains the grand lobby and stunning decor. This is a very special hotel in a perfect location just slightly away from the mayhem of Les Ramblas. We can not fault the Breakfast and recommend drinks in the roof top bar. ........definitely Worth the extra euros. ,5,2019,06,19
29,Holiday Stay,This luxury hotel is a must stay if visiting Barcelona. Service is 10 out of 10. Staff met our taxi at the door each one personally welcoming us. This hotel definitely made our stay in Barcelona very memorable. ,5,2019,06,18

29,Fabulous ,"We really enjoyed staying in El Palace. It’s Sumptuously decorated and very elegant. The concierge were helpful with restaurant recommendations etc, very professional and polite, we couldn’t fault them. Our room was a junior suite it  was spacious clean and comfortable. The shower was great, & our bed very comfortable. The breakfast was very good, catering for everyone. The roof top bar is a nice place to have a drink and chill out with a good view over the city of Barcelona. We had dinner there one night and lunch another, both were very good. Very expensive price wise,  they were over the top with both food and drinks. We were told ( also in our booking) that we were entitled to a $100. usa voucher to use for food, beverages or the spa. This wasn’t taken off our account at checkout, maybe an oversight. On the whole we enjoyed our time here.",5,2019,06,14
29,Amazing Classic Hotel,"The building has definitely a history which can be felt streightaway when stepped in. Lobby area is mindblowingly stunning. You can grab a seat and just look at the structure and art to enjoy for a while. 

Lovely room with fantastic amenities. Its big and super clean. Staff are nice and friendly. The rooftop restaurant is also a great place to eat fine-dining food and get the best from wonderful garden and the beautiful restaurant area. 

What they offered and positively shocked me was the free first-class transfer service to the outlet village with VIP services. 

The only slight disadvantage was windows facing city, which was not completely sound proof and didnt let a nice view to outside.",5,2019,06,13
29,Beautiful Hotel,This hotel will make you feel in different century. We stayed in Spacious room with balcony.  Reception area felt a bit small but once we collected our room key.... wow. The lobby cafe was extravagant. ,5,2019,06,09
29,El Palace,"El Palace is without equal. It is an old school oasis of gracious hospitality, a charming and genuinely concerned staff. From front desk, to restaurant and bars, housekeeping and back of the house, the hotel’s attention to detail is nonpareil.

",5,2019,06,08
29,Excellent service,"This is a very nice hotel with en excellent location. Breakfast was amazing! But the best thing about it is the staff! Excellent staff, friendly and helpful in every possible way. Will definitely come back!!",5,2019,06,06
29,"Loved it! Clean, comfortable and classy","We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with a 3 year old and throughly enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable setting, warm staff members and wonderful location were some highlights for us in regard to this hotel. Taxi stand is right across and plenty of good restaurants around this place. 
All in all a great place to stay.
 ",5,2019,06,04
29,Most Amazing Stay,This is a first class hotel all the way. Amazing in every way. Everyone is so helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. Can’t say enough about this wonderful place! The food and drinks are wonderful as well!,5,2019,06,04
29,Great visit! ,"Spent 4 nights here and loved coming back after every single stroll in the city. Close to placa catalunya and la rambla with superior service and a staff that genuinely cares and welcomes you with open arms. The interiors are other world, you feel like a catalonian royal living here. The breakfast was same everyday but more than variety for vegetarians and non-vegs. Definetly worth coming back just for the super comfy beds! ",5,2019,06,02
29,Barcelona Great Gatsby Style,"The check-in counter was kind of smallish but grand in setting. It was an old hotel with lots of character. 

The lobby bar / lounge like an Aladdin cave next to the check-in counter was the most charming I have seen in my extensive travels. The stained glass ceiling, antique leather sofas, thick draping and the magnificent bar counter in the center were all so very lux. Every late evening we had high tea and delicious cocktails after our sightseeing. This is one feature of the hotel that stays in my memory forever.

We were busy with the many sites in Barcelona. We did not make much use of the pool that came with a wonderful view of the Sagrada Familia (see pic). Throughout our stay, their very kind concierge offered top notch service with sound advice and recommendation.

Most sites were within walking distance including the Las Ramblas. Taxi from the hotel to the Sagrada Familia was a mere 5 minutes.

Jay Gatsby would have been very happy staying in this grand mansion.",5,2019,06,02
29,one of the best hotel in Barcelona,"outstanding service , beautiful terrace level . My family  stayed in the rooms 223 and 219, 312, 313 and would come again with no doubt. the breakfast is great. concierges are very helpful. Real 5 star hotel",5,2019,05,31
29,Truly a palace!,"A beutiful place that makes you feel like you are in a different century.  Great rooms, great service, good location, unbelievable concierge service.  Breakfast was ordinary, but very good (we didn't order the specials).
For people who start the day with a good workout, the gym was unsatisfactory (to say the least),  but other than that, highly recommended.",5,2019,05,27
29,The choice for elegant getaway!,"We spent a long weekend at El Palace with our friends and enjoyed our stay a lot. The hotel is very clean and quite and full of oh so kind of old fashioned luxury!❤️ The location is excellent, just near everything but not in the crowded tourist area. And the staff, they are so polite and friendly - my husband even got the crutches from the concierge when he broke his knee! That really is something!! 🌹 Will come back, thank you so much!",5,2019,05,21
29,Beautiful Grand Hotel in Barcelona,"Celebrating the hotels 100th anniversary, the El Palace is elegant and seems to be recently refurbished and is very well maintained.  Everything is spotless, our room on the 6th floor was spacious and very comfortable.  The roof top bar area has great views and is a nice place to relax.  The location is well suited for seeing the sites, and the staff was extremely helpful.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2019,05,20
29,El Palace,"A fabulous hotel in a great location to see the city. Comfortable yet elegant, all amenities provided. Staff friendly and helpful.

29,El Palace Hotel - Barcelona,"This was a great hotel! The building and public spaces are grand, I think it was the Ritz in the past.  But as nice as the hotel is, the staff were super attentive and friendly.  From the doorman, to the reception desk and especially the concierge desk, we could not have asked for better service. We will definitely stay there the next time we go to Barcelona.",5,2019,04,24
29,Fantastic hotel and experience,This hotel was excellent. Hotel was very comfortable. Friendly staff. Great location. Excellent food. My husband loved the cigar room and whiskey tasting. Georgie was great. We will be returning next year. ,5,2019,04,20
29,Great Choice Amazing Staff,Cannot say enough good things about how the staff at El Palace treated us from the moment we arrived.  The facilities are gorgeous and we experienced true 5 star service that made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. Concierge professionals are the best anywhere and we highly recommend this well run hotel.,5,2019,04,12
29,Barcelona 2019,"AMAZING hotel, Great location and the personnel was first class. Only issue was this blue light on the wall switch that kept us up the first night. We had to get uo and cover it with a pillow. Unfortunately, when they cleaned the room they would remove the pillow and after falling asleep again, we would be woken up by this intense light.",5,2019,04,01
29,This hotel make the difference: Luxury pure!,"Located at a main street but not far away from city center.

The building itself has an interesting old design. It is decorated well from outside.

In front of the hotel doormen are waiting for guests to open the door of cars and to pick up the luggage and to guide you to the reception or into the hotel.

You will be greeted with a smile. 

At the reception desk I presented my voucher for the prepaid (!) stay.

Soon I got asked for my credit card. 

After asking for what I have rejected it. 

Now the receptionist restarted his wish. After rejecting it again he called a supervisor. 
The Lady (wearing glasses) appeared and repeated the wish to get the credit card for getting a deposit.

I still rejected it and have informed them that they can unload the Mini Bar if they want. Then they have organized it.

Now a young lady has guided us to our 
Classic Room. Each detail of the hotel facilities was told.

At first sight you will be impressed by the elegant conservative design of this hotel which makes the difference to the majority of other hotels in this city.

Here -with the exception at Check-In- you will find best service as well. 

The staff is well trained!

If you are looking for a luxury stay here you will find it. Get spoiled and pampered. 

The room itself also was elegant furnitered and designed.

But some things could be done better:

The toilet paper is not soft and has not even 4 layers.

The flexible tube next to the toilet is always touching your back when you sit on the toilet. 
Why is there no brush to clean the toilet?

The metal bin box in the separate toilet  room is looking cheap comparing to the rest of the interior design.

The upper bed with the blankets is not the best solution because during the night you will find two separate pieces because it is not one unit. 

The TV is integrated in a mirror!

The windows are sound proofed and most street noise you will not hear anymore.

The bathroom has a separate showerroom and bathtub.

There is no bidet.

A binbox is missed. 

Breakfast is satisfying although I have missed more cold cuts.

The staff also here was very attentive, fast and friendly.

The atmosphere and design in this room was perfect as well.

The Cocktail Bar is only offering Cocktails the female server has told us  while we have asked for a wine list. 

But she then offered us 3 white wines by the glass.

We have not got informed about prices per glass.

This concept should be improved!

This Bar also has a little stage for concerts. 

How can we charge our electronic services without creeping under tables? In the bathroom?

Check Out was done friendly and fast.

I can higly recommend this hotel.

My subjective rating:

Ambiance rooms and hotel: 5 points
Service: 5 points

29,One of the best,"Stayed at El Palace with clients for four nights in March. The Hotel was perfectly situated and walking distance from most of the tourist attractions, but it was the service from all the hotel staff that really impressed me. Every person in the hotel was not just friendly but very professional and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and the bar must be one of the best i have ever visited anywhere. There was world class live music on the Friday and Saturday and a great selection drinks and cocktails. If i visit Barcelona in future this will be the only hotel i will stay at.",5,2019,03,31

29,Wonderful Service,I stayed here with my two teenagers. My daughter is very allergic to nuts and they were very good about her allergy even alerting us to the fact that sauces in Catalonia often contain almonds. Service was impeccable — they even remembered our drink orders from the night before and made sure to seat us at the same table whenever we ate in their restaurant. Rooms were lovely and updated. I would definitely stay here again!,5,2019,03,21
29,Lovely classical hotel,Fantastic hotel with outstanding staff and food. Only problem was the wifi was terrible everywhere which makes it difficult for a work trip. Spa is lovely and roof top pool would be beautiful in summer months.,5,2019,03,16
29,The Royal treatment at the El Palace,"Wonderful and beautiful hotel. Stand extremely attentive and very good Spa. My room was elegant and comfortable. I liked the bidet and loads of storage space. 
Hotel is centrally located, walking distance to Las Ramblas,  Passeig de Gràcia and Catalunya Plaça. Concierge extremely helpful with history and directions",5,2019,03,14
29,Excellent,The hotel is top class with very polite staff! Room is big with a fantastic bathroom and very comfortable bed! The staff took care of everything we asked ! The hotel is more than clean! I would definitely recommend it! ,5,2019,03,11
29,The best place to stay in Barcelona!!!!!!!!!,"I rely on reviews all the time for travel for my family so I wanted to take a minute and share my amazing experience at this hotel.  I was traveling with my 18 year old daughter to visit my older daughter who was studying abroad in Barcelona. We chose this hotel based on location and reviews.  I could not have made a better choice. 

First I have to start with my favorite experience at the hotel. They have a cocktail lounge call the Bluesman Cocktail Bar.  We would meet with my daughter and her boyfriend and all their friends each night before dinner for drinks. We were taken care of by the two kindest nicest women we met in Spain. Diana and Coco were amazing. They made fabulous drinks, always had a smile and made our whole experience something we looked forward to each night.  I will miss that place very much.  As a added bonus they have the best selection of Bourbons in Barcelona and make a great Manhattan and Sazerac. 

So beyond having the best bar the hotel was immaculate. The staff was constantly striving and succeding in helping us have the best stay at all times. The Conceirge’s helped us with dinner reservations every night. They sent us to the most amazing places with great food and atmosphere. I literally asked them each night to change the time or the number of guests I would have and they did so each time and were so nice about it. It would be impossible to name everyone but thank you to Idalija, Miguel, Alex, Alexis and if I forgot anyone I apologize.  

The rooms were large and comfortable and very classy. I loved the pressure of the shower and the beds were so comfortable. I celebrated my 50th  birthday while there and they sent multiple little surprises to my room. Just so thoughtful and kind. It’s the little things that make you feel at home and special in a place especially while traveling abroad.  We ordered room service multiple times for water or snacks and when they said it would be 5 minutes it was exactly 5 minutes. I know most travelers appreciate when people say that they will do something and they do. The housekeeping staff must have cleaned and turned down our room multiple times a day.  They were wonderful. 

This is probably my longest review ever but I would encourage anyone who travels to Barcelona to experience this hotel and you can’t miss Diana and Coco at the Bluesman ( which also has great live music). I know many families visit students from the USA studying abroad and I can’t think of a better spot to stay. Thank you to the Hotel for making our stay one of our favorite trips ever.",5,2019,03,10
29,10 star service,"thanks to near 71k readers I try to honor these readers with transparency and independency.

the service delivered by El Palace (former Ritz for some) makes you feel at home and very spoiled without robotized and “fake” sympathetic atitudes!

small things makes a lot of difference, which includes smiling and professional doorman, rhat warned me about the bad situation of one of the tyres of the rented car used to head Andorra (maybe deserve a careful review)

so don’t hesitate to bring to this Palace oops place to be treated not as a royalness but as a member of their family!",5,2019,03,08

29,A Truly Exceptional Hotel,"From the moment the Taxi door was opened on arrival until it was closed on our departure my wife and I experienced the most magical time at this truly exceptional hotel

The level of service and customer care is something that will stay in our hearts and minds for a very long time. Every person in every department has one very simple focus and that is to look after their guests. Nothing is too much trouble for any member of the team at this hotel and everything is done with good grace and always accompanied by an engaging smile.
If you are planning a trip to the beautiful city of Barcelona it will be enhanced by staying at the El Palace without a shadow of doubt

29,"Historic unique and beautiful hotel, superb service. totally recommended","We arrived BCN for 4 nights, Hotel decoration is really unique - luxurious and beautiful old European design - feels like you back in time to 1930 on the old Ritz hotel.
The bar on the the under floor is definitely place to hang and visit, weekend we visit 
 was cool program - including Cubanic band and even Flamenco night on saturday.
The final impressive about El Palace is the high professional service with superb workers that really care about guests having the best vacation. this kind of 5 star ,service reminds me again why we love spend time and come back to this high-end unique hotel. 

Summarize;
Next time we arrive BCN we'll definitely be happy to come again.

Cater to all even serve halal.Rooms- very clean and spoilt for choice when it came to choosing pillows :).value for money :- It was definitely worth its price. ,5,2019,01,22
29,All I needed was a crown!,"Let’s just say that if my daughter heard me gush one more time about this hotel, she was going to stay in another room!   We were treated like royalty, the staff was beyond friendly and helpful.  The hotel is simply magnificent, from the beautiful chandeliers and light fixtures, to the heavy drapery and grandiose staircase, the “speakeasy”bar, the unbelievable view from the never ending rooftop, and the simply delicious breakfast.  Do you ever have those dreams where you find another room in your house, that was our reality at this hotel.  On the last day, breakfast was served in an equally elaborate ballroom that we didn’t even know was there AND the serving staff showed me where breakfast is served in the warmer months, again had no idea it was part of hotel and it was simply  awesome! Great location, close to subway and the “Fifth Ave” of Barcelona.",5,2019,01,17
29,Quality still exists ! Thank God.,"My partner and l recently visited this Hotel, and were blown away by it's opulence,splendour and refinement.It is a one off venue, and thoroughly deserves it's high standing in Barcelona society.
A stay at this hotel would not be complete without a visit to their stunning cocktail bar, live music and attentive staff, make for a perfect evening.
We hit the ground with a bump, when we returned to the real world !",5,2019,01,16

29,True 5-Star Luxury!!!,"The best Concierge staff in Europe!  Their advice and suggestons perfect, their assistence invaluable! The rest of the staff equally wonderful.  Room was very comfortable, and breakfasts every morning enough to keep you going till dinner.  El Palace has replaced the Plaza Athenee as my new favorite hotel.",5,2019,01,15
29,Wonderful,We stayed at hotel el palace Barcelona for our honeymoon. It was a wonderful stay. The hotel has a very Royal feeling to it and it is very close to all the big happenings in the city. The staff was extremely helpful and I will definitely look forward to visiting the hotel and staying there again.,5,2019,01,09
29,"Wonderful Suite, service good but not great..","We stayed in the two bedroom Miro Suite. When we arrived the check in person was a bit confused. Once we got to our room, we were greeted with a nice fruit basket and some other things for our kids. The suite was really large. The bathroom was really nice and the shower was awesome. Since we were staying for a while, I really appreciated all the cabinet space in the dressing room. As we were in one of the presidential suites , it had multiple doors, so random service people used to show up and knock on different doors and it got a bit annoying. The first night, the electricity kept going out, and turning back on with a bang. They fixed the issue the next day but my kids thought the room was haunted lol. The breakfast each morning was wonderful, however, the service was just basic. Seemed as if the staff was tired of greeting people or smiling. The location is great, you can walk to a lot of places. I would consider staying here again, mainly because of the location and the breakfast. The service needs to improve though. A smile wouldn’t hurt. 
Pros: Miro Suite, Location, Breakfast
Cons: bored staff",4,2019,01,08
29,3 nights stay in suite,"Truly a classy n luxurious hotel, love it throughly! Classic ambience, cosy, comfortable, excellent entrance, lobby, lobby lounge, restaurant. Service immaculate!!!!! Down to every details! All F&B staff excellent, truly  5 stars standard. Every presentation of f&b was impressive. Chef catered steamed Chinese food to my son daily!!!! V flexible.  Hotel room was excellent too. Housekeeping, concierge all excellent. Nothing negative to mention at all. We are blessed to have chosen the right place to stay Cos it made a great difference to feel at home. ",5,2019,01,08
29,A truly luxurious hotel,"This hotel will not disappoint. I stayed in a Deluxe Double Room at El Palace for four nights and I was impressed the entire stay. The beauty of the hotel was stunning -- just the architecture alone is gorgeous, but the decor and views perfected it.  Everything about this hotel is classic luxury: the ornate decor, the extravagant lobby and staff who remember your name and greet you warmly whenever you come and go, the delicious and beautiful restaurants in the hotel, the high-end spa (great massages!), the beautiful rooms, and the predictable and diligent service of the staff. Every detail was taken care of with precision, and I felt so comfortable and relaxed while I was there. Anything I asked of the front desk, they quickly jumped on and fulfilled with a smile. This hotel is the definition of a luxury hotel. 

There were only three obstacles for me. First, if you're a coffee person like me, the lack of a Nespresso machine and the high fee for room service will leave you disheartened with the instant coffee provided in your room. But you're in beautiful Barcelona, so it's a good excuse to start walking around the city first thing. Second, the process for breakfast was a challenge. Most five star hotels I've stayed at include some sort of complimentary breakfast in the base rate, but this one doesn't and the breakfast available isn't super convenient. While the food was delicious, it was also spendy and the high fee for room service on top of it made room service not worth the value unless you were in a rush. If you went to eat in the dining room, it's not the kind of dining room you feel comfortable wandering into in yoga pants and a hoodie. It's so beautiful and formal, I felt like I needed to actually get somewhat dressed up before I went down. Once you're down there, there's a lot of options and they're all delicious. But same as the coffee situation, you're also within walking distance of a lot of other great options too. Finally, when I went to use the hairdryer in my room it stopped working after only a couple minutes and then I noticed the power plug was literally falling apart. Maybe someone else dropped it and they didn't notice when they were preparing the room, but it scared me that I could have been electrocuted. I called them and asked for a new one, and they were at my door within a couple minutes with a new one, took the old one, and sincerely apologized. 

Overall I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,01,06
29,Opulent Barcelona Hotel,"Exceptionally nice hotel.  Breakfast buffet was excellent.  I hired a Mercedes and driver/guide through hotel.  Unfortunately, the driver did not have a proper grasp of the English language and was not an expert guide of Barcelona whatsoever as the tariff would indicate.  I brought this matter to the attention to hotel management but I received no credit.",5,2019,01,04
29,Classy luxury,"We loved this place from the very first minute. Perfect location, amazing staff. We could check in at 11.00 am which was very convenient. We enjoyed the room service and the very well equipped mini bar .... thanks for taking such good care of us! ",5,2018,12,26
29,Best hotel in Barcelona ,"We’ve been coming to Barcelona for 20 years and this is definitely our favourite hotel. Amazing service, the cellar cocktail bar is awesome and the rooms are much bigger than average. The concierge is really helpful and the roof garden is lovely - even at Christmas!",5,2018,12,26
29,"Palace Barcelona, Spain",The location was perfect. the hotel lobby is beautiful and inviting. the hotel front desk was charming and they have keys with big tassels and you drop off your key on the way out and pick it up on the way in. they all know you by site. the rooms are incredible and the stair up to the rooms are like you are in a mansion. I would stay there again.,5,2018,12,11
29,Highlight our trip to Barcelona!,Once of a lifetime stay at the Palace. It was hard to get out and leave the hotel. All time customer service and rooftop views. Check out our YouTube video of our trip for more sights: GoPro 2K: Running Around Spain and France HD.,5,2018,12,09
29,Perfect.,"Wonderful stay & great staff. You will not find a more suitable hotel in Barcelona.  Love it.  The staff all over the hotel had a mission to please , the breakfast & lobby halls are majestic, the waiters & the concierge staff are so friendly, they just go out of their way to help .  Defiantly recommended for couples & family leisure stay.",5,2018,12,06
29,Lovely romantic getaway,"We have stayed here before, and on this occasion just for the night. Beautifully decorated hotel. Good fun on the Friday night downstairs in the 'Jazz Bar' ... where we listed to live Cuban music. Breakfast was ample and the location is central.",5,2018,12,03
29,Great Hotel in city centre,Great hotel with a fantastic location - the service was remarkable.  The attention to detail in the guestroom was amazing!  Love the secret minibar behind the painting! The gold framed television went perfectly with the guestroom. ,5,2018,12,02
29,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS IN EVERY WAY!,"Breathtakingly beautiful hotel, ultimate luxury and class, worth every penny.   Wonderful staff (Amal was amazing!) and great food and service.    Will stay again for sure!   So glad we didn't settle for other hotels, this one was number one.   Great location, easy to get to and located in a lovely neighborhood.",5,2018,11,29
29,"Classic, old charm with amazing staff","Chance booking for a couple of nights in Barcelona turned into a trip back in time. It's only when you arrive do you see how classy this place is and it turns out it used to be the Ritz Barcelona so its only probably changed its name!!
Reception very helpful, located off the lobby in a small private area, 
Concierge desk very old school and there are no credit card keys here - old style gold tassle keyring which they must find hard to hang onto !
Room was beautiful - old style decor but clean, linens top class and every possible in room and bathroom amenity
the basement cocktail bar is a real step back in time and great care and attention from elaborate cocktails to simple gin and tonics.
great location only 10 mins walk from main attractions.
will return and highly recommend ",5,2018,11,29

",5,2018,11,23
29,Beautiful and historic hotel where you'll be treated like royalty,"Step back to a more refined era and enjoy the attention and opulence of this place. It's beautifu! But it's also somewhat stuffy, on a very busy intersection with lots of street noise, and not as well situated to walk to the best part of Barcelona, the Bari Gotic, as some other equally gracious hotels... and it is very pricy. The breakfast, the service, the facility itself makes the Palace deserving of it's five-star rating, but I suggest, other than just to say you've been there, you may find some other hotels more comfortable and better located... unless your reason for being in the city is to shop high-end stores.",5,2018,11,20
29,First time touring Barcelona,"This was the most elegant hotel I have ever visited. I took pictures of every area, it was beautiful.The rooms were spacious, beds and linens superior, we slept great! The staff was most attentive and courteous, our lunch there was very good, I had the crab rolled in avacado. It's pricey but , Oh, so worth it!   Ann from Texas",5,2018,11,19
29,10/10,By far...one of the finest hotels I have stayed at. The staff and rooms are 5 star. Beds are very comfortable....quiet rooms. The restaurant with outdoor seating was phenomenal. Elegance everywhere. Top notch service.  Beautiful flowers. Helpful concierge.,5,2018,11,19
29,Wonderful Hotel,We were only able to stay at the hotel for one night because of a flight home after a cruise. We would definitely recomend this property as 5 star. We were upgraded to a suite and received wonderful service from reception and the conceigere. The restaurant in the back of the lobby was very good . Wish we could have stayed longer.. ,5,2018,11,16
29,Opulence and class!,"An amazing experience to be in a ""Ritz"" hotel. Old world class and elegance, with exceptional service and really great rooms. We were upgraded to a suite, so I cant comment on the other rooms, but the suites are really something special. We enjoyed every minutes of our stay there.The location is superb! Our flight home was late, 10pm, and they were happy to provide us a temporary room till our driver collected us, which was really a great help. 

Once in a lifetime experience this place. Really amazing!",5,2018,11,15
29,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed there 30 years ago and since we were returning to Barcelona we returned.  I couldn't believe that the hotel got even better!  How does that happen?!  Well, according to the nice man at the front desk, a dedicated staff who has been there over 30 years.  It shows.  Everyone is lovely, the hotel is beautiful and they continue to update it and modernize it without losing the old world charm.  The location is amazing but quiet which was such a nice change from our previous nights in Rome.  The bed was so comfortable and this might sound silly, but the bathroom had the most wonderful bathtub and the shower!  After walking all day, it was such a treat.  If you're thinking about booking this hotel stop thinking and just book.",5,2018,11,09

29,A true gem.,"This hotel is by far the most unique and special hotel my husband and I have stayed at.  We stayed over Christmas and our last night we went downstairs and had dinner at the lounge area.  Amazing!  Went downstairs the next morning and there were real, huge Christmas trees set up with lights and decorations.  It really took my breath away.  Extremely detail oriented.  Definitely looking forward to our return.",5,2018,11,06
29,WOW!,"This hotel used to be The Ritz, so the WOW factor is pretty high.  If you like a beautiful, traditional, ornate, gorgeously appointed hotel, this is the one for you.  The public areas and our room (suite actually) were traditionally decorated - lots of gold and brocade, etc.  But the bathroom is all sleek and modern.  Chopard toiletries no less.  The whole place was just absolutely wonderful.  Friendly, professional staff, good location, amazing breakfast buffet.",5,2018,11,06
29,Brilliant!!!!!,"High level of professionalism and kindness of the staff.
I really appreciated the attention given to my little boy Enzo.

We felt like home away of our home.
The property looks amazing, beds are much confortable, breakfast buffet is fantastic and the location is perfect to enjoy the city.",5,2018,11,04
29,Almost but not quite there,"For a property that, until recently, was a Ritz you expect a lot ... and it delivers for the most part. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great ... however a few surly waiters in the dining room soured things somewhat. Also for a hotel of this standing you don't expect a broken toilet seat and mouldy shower ... having said that ... it is a spectacular property",4,2018,10,25
29,Fabulous hotel,Wonderful hotel with magnificent old world charm.  The rooms are very well appointed and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are large and luxurious.  The concierge was extremely helpful with restaurant reservations. Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2018,10,24

29,The Best of the Best!,"This hotel is truly a palace and makes you feel like you are the visiting royalty.  It has mastered the art of old-world elegance and luxury and is in the perfect location in Barcelona.  Our room was huge and extremely quiet.  And the roof-top bar, with its 360 degree views of the city and breath-taking late night views of Sagrada Familia, makes it the perfect retreat at the end of a busy day.  This is the only place I will stay in Barcelona.",5,2018,10,22
29,Barcelona - Real ,"After Madrid we have decided to attend match between these two grands in Barcelona. Choose this hotel, everything was nice !
Concierge help us with tickets, this time we have ones. Nice places, interesting match. 
Also concierge helped us with taxi. The was confuse, Barcelona has lost the match and as usual, all transport including taxis, stop servicing , so thanks to him we could decide it.
For information : stadium is too far from centre, it's not like Madrid.
Only little disappointment was breakfast, not products. They have serves it open air, in early April it is not right idea, however we enjoy Barcelona )",5,2018,10,22
29,Gorgeous Hotel within walking distance of everything!!!,This hotel was originally the Ritz Carlton and it certainly still retains the elegance of it's former life.  Great location for walking to most sights including all things Gaudi.  Beautifully appointed rooms and service with a smile.,5,2018,10,20
29,A fantastic hotel in Barcelona,"Coming to Barcelona for the first time after visiting much of the rest of the country, I had no idea what to expect as we did not spend a lot of tike studying hotels in Barcelona. What I found was the most fantastic hotel with the friendliest staff ever, The hotel is truly beautiful, the suites are extremely comfortable, and the rooftop deck is a true plus. We were so pleased with El Palace and wish we had made our stay longer. A beautiful city and a fantastic hotel to make a visit perfect. ",5,2018,10,19
29,End your cruise with a few extra days in Barelona,Great place to stay.  The hotel was located an easy walk to the shopping and tour bus locations.  Cabs were also available all the time for getting around.  Many restaurants were close and easy to get to.  Staff was always helpful and had good recommendations.,5,2018,10,17
29,Classical Upscale Hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed three nights at the El Palace.  The room was comfortably sized, especially for a European hotel, with warm furnishings.  The bed was comfortable, with nice linens.  Bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower (rainshower option).  My wife appreciated that there were two sinks.  Only fault I could find with the room was lack of outlets for charging our usual fleet of electronics.  I had to unplug a lamp to plug in a tablet.  Wifi was excellent in the room, and the hotel has a great central location within walking distance of most sites.

For our first breakfast, fresh off the airplane, we made the mistake of ordering off the menu.  The resultant scrambled eggs, delivered after a half hour delay, were overcooked and dry.  After that, we stuck to the buffet breakfast, which frankly, was just average and a bit disappointing for such an upscale hotel.  

We ate one dinner at the Terrace Restaurant on the roof and it was delightful and fairly reasonably priced.  It was adjacent to their small, unheated pool.",5,2018,10,16
29,Very Cassy and Cozy,"One of the best hotels we visited in Europe.. Of course the location is great and very close to most of the attractions.. we really enjoyed our stay, the rooms were great and the breakfast buffet was perfect..

However, the best thing amongst all was the service, especially the reception team.",5,2018,10,15
29,Grand Style...feel like a princess,"standard room was lovely, easy access. Doormen were elegant and helpful. Loved the breakfast and the breakfast room, which altho expensive, we were comped for joining a hotel assn. Lobby is elegant too",5,2018,10,15
29,Stunning food and rooftop ,You don’t have to stay at this hotel to enjoy its delights. We went to the rooftop restaurant for dessert and drinks. The apple tart with dulce de leche and raspberry julep were stellar. The view of the city is glorious accompanied by dancing illuminated fountains and garden seating. ,5,2018,10,14
29,Class Will Tell,"A really great experience.    Excellent room, top service.   Kudos to Concierge Alexis. He and his colleagues made out first visit to Barcelona richer and fuller.  Quality doesn't come cheap, but El Palace gives true value for the price.",5,2018,10,12
29,Good but not great,Good location. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The public areas in the hotel are lovely. The views from the rooftop bar are beautiful. The room was nice- but there were some cracked tiles in the bath. There was a lack of plugs to charge a phone. There was nothing in the room that explained the hotel services. There was an electric teapot but only 2 packages of Nescafé instant coffee. The buffet breakfast was a disappointment- no hot choices. At this level that was most surprising.,4,2018,10,10
29,Brand new rooms,"One of the best hotels in Cataluña by far (Formerly The Ritz) Great atmosphire. The personnel at the Consierge desk are the best guide for Barcelona atractions and restaurants. Wonderful bar at the top floor for afternoon drinks or a swim.
Great place to stay.",5,2018,10,09
29,"Barcelona's Best - FInest Hotel, Excellent staff and service","The Palace is a grand hotel with modern amenities.  The rooms were in great condition - bathrooms have been upgrades with the latest features, the staff was always available, location allows walking access to most of the cities best sites.  We looked forward to returning to the room each day to relax and clean up after our days of waling through the city.  Its been a while since I visited a hotel that has maintained the level and quality of staff to assure we never had to wait for attention. ",5,2018,10,09
29,Beautiful Hotel,"This was one of the beautifully appointed hotels I’ve ever seen. My one and only complaint was the lack of coffee in the rooms. There were TWO packets of instant coffee, regular and decaf. For the amount they charge each night it was disconcerting to find this lack of detail. We ended up getting room service so we could have coffee and pastry.

The location was great.",4,2018,10,08
29,Great Experience,Perfect Location and very close to all attractions in city center. The hotel decoration is magnificentand he rooms are very clean. I highly recommend the hotel for families and singles as well. Thanks ,5,2018,10,04
29,Lovely Rooms and a Room Garden of Dreams,"First Class in every way, this ancient Ritz has been restored to former glories .  
Make sure that you visit the fabulous roof gardens where lemon trees had scent and glamour
to your libation.  The concierge are particularly willing, though they tend to have less-than-citywide
influence.",5,2018,10,03
29,Fantastic,"Excellence in all ways Accommodation superb ,Superb service,Helpful staff Could not fault it in any way.Would highly recommend it. We had a 3 night stay. Good location within walking distance of many restaurants and sites",5,2018,10,02
29,Wow!!!! Wonderful and beautiful hotel!!,"This hotel is simply majestic, gorgeous, and wonderful!!!  We stayed for a few nights during our stay in Barcelona, and the staff and service were impeccable, welcoming, and outstanding to all international clientele.

The hotel is a historic gem (former Ritz-Carlton, and Salvador Dali resided here for a few years). They maintained the hotel nicely, and you cannot help but to awe at the architecture, decorations, and rooms. So worth the stay if you want to get pampered and explore Barcelona!  It is better than the photos posted online. 

The hotel is close to major attractions (Casa Bahtlo, the Square, and Las Ramblas). Great breakfast and restaurant for dining. Rooftop bar is beautiful and you get to see views of the city.

Thank you, El Palace, for your exceptional service, beauty, and slendor! ",5,2018,09,28
29,"Excellent, gorgeous hotel!!!","Absolutely excellent hotel with gorgeous decor, highly professional service, beautiful rooms, and stunning rooftop restaurant, bar and pool!!! The entire experience could not have been any better!!! I would very highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,09,26
29,Perfect hotel for a perfect trip!,"I booked this hotel for two nights as a surprise trip for my girlfriend and  wanted to stay somewhere special. I can honestly say this hotel exceeded all expectations, the moment you arrive you know it's a special place and the interior is breathtaking. The staff were so kind and helpful, and the room was incredible. Make sure you take advantage of the views from the rooftop bar, they are fantastic! This was the perfect trip and my girlfriend left barcelona as my fiancee!!",5,2018,09,24

29,My FAVORITE hotel in the world!,"I cannot write enough good things about the El Palace Hotel and staff. We were treated as royalty during our stay. It all started upon arrival... We had some delays in our travel from Paris and were about to miss a food tour we had booked. The staff was very concerned for us and took copies of our passports and credit card as well as our luggage and sent us on our way so we could meet up with the tour. Amazing service!   When we arrived back to the hotel after the tour, we finished the checkin process and they escorted us to our room. The staff had upgraded our room to have a balcony and a GORGEOUS VIEW! They also had a wonderful bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room, with a hand written note from the General Manager. 

Our room was so luxurious. It was quite large with a separate walk in closet. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub...and I want this bathroom in my house now!

The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had in my travels as well.

The staff were always so accommodating and helpful and they all remembered our names for the whole stay.

We will most definitely return to El Palace during our next trip. They made our 10 year Anniversary trip something we will always remember!",5,2018,09,19
29,A stay fit for royalty!,Very elegant and yes you are treated like royalty. If you use the sofa bed in a suite - beware - like most sofa beds the frame is felt. I suggested a mattress topper. Place is superb - The breakfast was MAGNIIQUE-  location PERFECT.,5,2018,09,18
29,Nice experience at Barcellona,Nice place to stay at Barcellona. I would recommend this place to my family or friends when they visit Spain.I appreciate especially for a woman working at reception desk and a man workiing in front of the entrance door. ,5,2018,09,16
29,superb,"I can't say enough about this hotel.  It is in an excellent location (a short walk to the Gothic area).  The room was spacious and well appointed.  The breakfast was plentiful.  The only criticism is that our room lacked sufficient lighting.  Other than that, our stay was close to perfect.",5,2018,09,16
29,Two days in Barcelona,"A top notch wonderful iconic hotel in the heart of the city!Beautiful views with a gorgeous pool, rooftop you feel special walking into this Palace hotel Warm friendly staff, loved Juan on the belldesk team and front desk and the concierge A+",5,2018,09,14
29,"Wonderful hotel, best staff","Recently spent three nights at this hotel.  Lovely rooms, great location, The hotel lobby was stunning as was the breakfast area.  There is a rooftop bar, restaurant and pool, with lovely views.
The staff was amazing!
I needed a doctor and the hotel had one to my room in minutes.  Afterward, the staff in front was so concerned about my well being.  I kept an ice pack with the front desk and they would deliver it to me when needed.

I highly recommend staying here.",5,2018,09,10

29,Fantastic Hotel,"A truely wonderful hotel, the building and decor is amazing and the staff are even better than the surroundings.Perfectly located for our stay. This 5 star hotel is also very child friendly and made my family feel extremely welcome from the moment we walked through the door. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona.  ",5,2018,09,05
29,Great hotel,Great experience. Phenomenal location and the service provided by the staff was outstanding. Room was clean and regularly kept clean. Ambiance was outstanding and the rooftop bar and pool were relaxing and romantic. ,5,2018,09,05
29,A+,This is definitely a great Hotel to stay at and conveniently located within a true Spain.  Other locations have become far too westernised.  Its also a safe area and a definite recommend for the Hotel !!,5,2018,09,05
29,Fantastic Hotel,"Our family loved the hotel, from the initial service to the checkout process.  They paid attention to all the details and really let us relax from the moment we stepped inside the beautiful hotel.I would definitely recommend this hotel for families with little kids as they were very accommodating to kids.",5,2018,09,04
29,One of the nicest hotels we've stayed in,"There's lots of specific details noted in other reviews regarding this hotel. It feels very old world and luxurious and the service is good. Our room facing the main street was fabulous and housekeeping was very good as well. If you look at its location on a map, it may appear bit out of the way, but its really not. There's decent access to La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter within about a 10 minute walk, but far enough away to feel a little less touristy. The lobby was comfortable and rather formal feeling, but was a nice place for coffee or tea (expensive). The bellman and lobby desk helped us with taxis and tickets to events. The rooftop area is fabulous. The nicest surprise was the unexpected and intimate jazz bar in the basement of the hotel. Felt a little like an old speakeasy with dark wood paneling. A great place to relax with after dinner drinks.",5,2018,09,04
29,"Great, but with a problem","It's old-fashioned in appearance, but it's modern in convenience. We enjoyed staying at the historic El Palace Hotel in Barcelona for several days before and after a recent cruise. The hotel, which dates back about a century, is in a quieter part of the city. But you can walk to the oldest neighborhoods. A major bus station and the subway are several blocks away. The waterfront is a couple miles away. The hotel's restaurants and rooftop bar are excellent, the service was good, the room was well-equipped with good air conditioning, spacious with a large closet and bathroom.  Unfortunately, the bathtub, like so many in Europe, was too narrow to be useful but the walk-in shower was great. The hotel, however, let us down when we needed help. Barcelona experienced a taxi strike, and after first promising to take us to our cruise in the hotel car the hotel backed down. Surely they could have found someone's uncle or brother or son to make a few Euros for driving us there. Ultimately, after much telephoning, the cruise ship's local travel operator diverted a bus to pick us up. No thanks to the hotel.",4,2018,09,03
29,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel was wonderful, very large and spacious rooms, high quality service and good location. The room and bathroom were large, quiet and no road noise, and bed quite comfortable. The breakfast was decent. Concierge dinner recommendations were excellent, we used then every night. The rooftop bar had a great view of the city. The service of the staff was great, very attentive for every need. Would definitely stay again.",5,2018,09,03
29,Lovely bit of luxury in the middle of Barcelona,"I stayed here three nights while on a business trip in Barcelona. This was my second trip to Barcelona (the first was a vacation almost ten years earlier, and we stayed in a highly rated B&B near the water). Since I already had seen all the major ""touristy"" sites, the proximity to any of these wasn't a consideration. However, even if it were, I would stay here again hands down!

Pluses:

Lovely, calming room straight out of a Jane Austen novel. Beautiful decor complete with a period fireplace. Drapes were massive and heavy, so even though I was right on the Gran Via a few floors up, the street noise was not intrusive at all. And my view, with the red geranium window boxes overlooking the street, was enchanting.

My room was surprisingly spacious, given that it is a historic property in the middle of a large European city. 

Bed and pillows were super comfy.

Great wifi

Large contemporary bathroom with luxurious towels

Friendly staff

Very good breakfast buffet in a lovely room

Excellent location. Even though it is in the middle of Barcelona and of course there are tourists everywhere, it was in a much nicer location than we had been previously. 

The minuses were negligible, but in case any of these peccadilloes matter to you:

Fitness center was small and had very basic equipment. 

Housekeeping generally was good but minibar and bathroom items were not consistently replaced.

There is a tea kettle, but the in-room tea/coffee service is basic and designed to make you just cave and order up room service. ;)

The king bed was huge but consisted of the typical European two twins pushed together. 

All in all, I had a wonderful time at El Palace and would definitely stay here again when returning to Barcelona for business or pleasure.",5,2018,08,31
29,Luxury but worth it?,"Lovely hotel. Service excellent , the rooms were roomy for 3 people. Nice touch with ‘turn down’ in the evening with sweets and a thought for the day!...bathroom super with plenty of accessories, on the down side the loo roll felt cheap!! 
Drinks very expensive we thought as was breakfast 
No doubt a beautiful hotel but we felt there was absolutely no atmosphere .",4,2018,08,28
29,Little gem of luxury in Barcelona ,"We enjoyed a 4 night break here and had a lovely room and good service from the staff. They were very friendly on arrival and the concierge team could not have been more helpful. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast room and plenty of variety to eat, but it doesn’t really cater well for evenings so I’d recommend a local restaurant across the rod called Patagonia. It has a rooftop pool which we didn’t use sadly but it looked great.",5,2018,08,27
29,El Palace Barcelona is amazing,"We ended a 3 week trip to Europe at El Palace, it was absolute luxury, calm luxurious serenity in a most amazing city. Loved the rooftop pool and bar, excellent service and food , thank you Jonathan for making our time relaxing up top even better. Service was immpecible.",5,2018,08,24
29,A perfect choice,Our stay was very memorable. Gorgeous authentic period property with unparalleled service.Genuinely attentive staff with a sense of reserve. The breakfasts were true silver service with the BEST pastries ever.We would love to stay again.,5,2018,08,23

29,STUNNING HOTEL,"Beautiful hotel, rooms are large with balcony, staff are excellent, breakfast area is beautiful, waiters attentive, a wonderful 5 star hotel.  A special thank you to Victor who saved us when we got the last available room after being stranded in Barcelona at 11pm on a Saturday night.  The hotel has a rooftop pool and everything is divine.",5,2018,08,19
29,Fabulous hotel- perfect location!,"Beautiful hotel located in the heart of Barcelona.  Only a 10 min walk to La Rambla and Boqueria.   Convenient to everything central (and the metro).
Pool on the roof is especially nice in the summer and the staff was extremely helpful.   Rooms and hotel were in top condition.  

",5,2018,08,13
29,Fabulous stay!!!,"I just stayed at El Palace in July with 14 family members.  We loved the hotel.  Their staff is absolutely amazing and went above and beyond the call of duty for us!  The hotel is gorgeous and very centrally located which was key during the taxi strike.  If we go back to Barcelona, we will stay there for sure.",5,2018,08,12
29,Il piacere di un soggiorno favoloso,"I recommend everyone to stay at the El Palace hotel. 5 stars GL deserve. Reception, concierge, room cleaning, breakfast, bar, everything perfect. Location in a very nice area and close to the high fashion shops. History and tradition. Luxury and quality of service. Very nice rooms. Sumptuous salons. You can not describe it, it is better to come here and enjoy it in person.",5,2018,08,12
29,Excellent Luxury Hotel Choice In Barcelona,"Expensive but worth very Euro. Professional and friendly staff. Rooms was very comfortable with good air conditioning to beat the summer heat especially since we were there in July. We especially enjoyed rooftop pool, terrace bar and restaurant was wonderful! Dining outside with a great view of the city was awesome. Good location with inexpensive choices for lunch and excellent shopping four blocks away. A cool downstairs bar with live music and secret cigar lounge that's hidden away. Ask if you can check out the Ronny Wood suite if your a Rolling Stones fan.",5,2018,08,10
29,Elegant hotel in Barcelona,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay in this luxurious hotel last month. Our room was more spacious than expected, had a great view and large walk-in closet. The staff were very courteous. Their turn down service was excellent.",4,2018,08,09

29,El Palace Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff. Everything was perfect. Great location. Taxis were on strike but not a problem to walk everywhere. Concierge very helpful for directions and tour information. Rooms very large and breakfast was good. Would recommend staying here",5,2018,08,07
29,Lovely stay in Barcelona Spain.,Beautiful hotel with exquisite service.  The staff was most helpful in directing us to fabulous restaurants and coffee shops near by.  Their rooftop restaurant and bar overlooking the beauty of the city is a must while enjoying one of their specialty drinks.  The Mediterranean is delivered ice cold inside a treasure chest.  ,5,2018,08,07
29,Luxury near Las Ramblas,"As soon as we arrived my daughter realized that this was the hotel where we stayed about 20 years ago on our first visit to Barcelona. At the time it was the Ritz, luxurious but very dated and dark. Renovations over the years (the most recent just a few months ago)  returned this beautiful palace to it's glory. The suites are very tastefully decorated, some of the best I've seen. Breakfast is in the solarium on the main level, and it's excellent with many choices of traditional Spanish cold cuts and sausages, queso fresco, delicious juices and freshly baked bread and pastries. The hotel was an easy walk from Las Ramblas and shopping areas, the old quarter and even Palau de la Musica.",5,2018,08,06
29,Superb !!,"Superb honeymoon stay. Impeccable quality and service. Nothing too much trouble. Everybody very attentive, polite and friendly. Thank you for making our stay so special.
Superb breakfast, recommend afternoon tea. Complete luxury.",5,2018,08,06

29,Excellent stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in July (as part 1 of our honeymoon). Cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the service. Concierge was extremely helpful, more than happy to assist us with dinner reservations, tour information and directions. Breakfast buffet was delicious (try the scrambled eggs!). Loved our stay and would stay here again.",5,2018,08,05
29,Luxury in Barcelona,"First class hotel, luxurious, strategically located close to La Rambla, shopping, sights. The staff makes the guests feel like family!!!!! Extremely helpful w dinner reservations, directions, and advice on getting the most out of a trip to Barcelona in just  2 days. They offer a classic European buffet brunch which was quite extensive and delicious.",5,2018,08,04
29,Barcelona during the taxi strike,"Our stay in Barcelona and at El Palace coincided with the taxi strike.  The demonstrations were a little unsettling to our children and we did our best to avoid those areas of demonstration.  The taxis blocked the entire avenue that El Palace is located. Local drivers were able to get around the road blocks. El Palace did great coordinating travel to and from the airport.  The remainder of the time we had previously arranged private tours or we walked, and walked and walked.  Staff throughout were wonderful. Our room was warm and made sleeping difficult.",5,2018,08,04
29,Perfect in any way,"Great place in every turn from the location to interior decorations of lobbie, restaurant, bar, terrace and the actual room.
Everyone were very professional and friendly, great breakfast, very cozy roof pool with nice 360 view roof deck.
During our stay there was a strike from taxi drivers, our hotel arranged transportation to airport to us.
Great job!
Thank you all so much!",5,2018,08,02
29,Amazing Stay!,"My husband and I were able to spend a few nights here. I cannot say enough about the service and accommodations! Upon checking in, we were greeted promptly (no language issues as neither of us speak Spanish). We were given a short tour and then then shown to our room (complete with a complimentary bottle of champagne). The room was spacious and lavish. Breakfasts at the hotel were fabulous! The large open area had table service for wine and cocktails in the evening after a tiring day of touring. I couldn't think of one thing which could have made this stay better.",5,2018,08,02
29,The best 5 star hotel we have ever stayed in ,"I want to say thank you to the staff at el palace hotel you were fantastic in every aspect of our stay 

The breakfast in the morning was lovely as was the room that they serve it in.

The staff at this hotel go above and beyond to make sure that all of your needs are take care of .

The rooms are very large , my wife and I stayed in a junior suit which had a nice sofa and chair as well as a king size bed  and desk . The shower was large enough for six people (lol)with multiple shower heads and separate toilet with 2 large sinks and of course a tub.

All in all I highly recommend a stay at the el palace Barcelona you will love it 

Kind regards 
The McGrath’s

29,A Perfect Family Experience,"Started off a 2 week tour of Spain with a 5 day stay here. And it did not disappoint. From the helpful and friendly staff to the world class service and amazing cuisine, they made the first leg of our stay unforgettable. It is centrally located, has a pool and reasonable room service rates that made it an ideal choice for a family of 6. We were off to another incredible adventure the day we left and even knowing this, my whole family had a hard time leaving.

The hotel was immaculate and had an old fashioned feel that you just don't get anymore. I really don't have much else to say other than thank you to everyone here for an amazing stay and for setting a standard for hotels that will be hard to match. We will be back.",5,2018,07,30
29,Nick60,"A terrific hotel. We stayed here in July 2018 for a week to celebrate our anniversary. Well appointed and attentive service,our only negative was the lack of a fine dining restaurant, the one there on the 7th floor was good but was not what we were looking for. Nevertheless a beautiful hotel situated in central Barcelona that is a great base for all the attractions.  Thanks.",4,2018,07,30
29,The Most Perfect Hotel,"So grateful that we selected El Palace as our hotel during our first visit to Barcelona. The staff greeted us with a warm welcome. The lobby is gorgeous and smells wonderful. Check-in was efficient and we were off to our room on the forth floor. The room was spacious and gorgeous. The pillow menu was a nice treat and we are going to buy our selected pillows from Coco-Mat. The bathroom was spacious and spotless. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast each day and it was one of the best breakfast buffets we’ve ever experienced. So many options and everything was delicious from the chopped fruit, to the scrambled eggs to the desserts. The buffet was constantly being tended to. We didn’t feel the need to order an omelet with so many choices. There was a security presence throughout the hotel and all staff members were very friendly. The concierge department was outstanding and very helpful. We spent the last day at the pool which was very relaxing. The location is perfect to access everything in the city. Overall, a pretty perfect hotel experience. Clearly the management and staff are 100 percent committed to making your stay the best it can be.",5,2018,07,29
29,Style and class,"Wonderful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The rooms are superbly renovated and the bed linen are amazing. The Spa would need some upgrade as per the hotel standards. Staff very welcoming and restaurants and roof terrace superb. I would only argue that I had send the hotel 3 emails requesting separate beds and nobody ever answered... I told reception when I checked in, I would have at least expected a better upgrade.... hahaha,  this said the staff was very nice and arranging as it was a hectic day due to the taxi strike.
",4,2018,07,28
29,Wow Wow Wow,"A beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Stunning room terrace and pool, with great city views. A perfect stay. Service outstanding. Exceeded expectations. Just wish we’d had more time to try the Mayan Spa. ",5,2018,07,27
29,Beautiful hotel and perfect location for touring Barcelona!,"El Palace is a jewel of a hotel in that wonderful city, Barcelona.  The hotel is beautifully appointed and well managed.  The rooftop pool and bar provides a beautiful view of Barcelona.  Our room was spacious with the bathroom being especially delightful.  Breakfast and lunch fare is excellent.  If travel takes us back to Barcelona, we would definitely stay at El Palace.",5,2018,07,25
29,Excellent in All respects but room description needs to be rethought,"The El Palace is an excellent hotel with great service, wonderful restaurants, and all the trappings of a 5 star property including a fabulous location, rooftop and lobby.  However, management should really rethink their room descriptions.  The classic room is described as being a relatively huge 38 square meters.  In fact the actual room is much smaller because the hotel counts the useless hallway space and the bathroom because the room's closet is actually in the bathroom. The room size is actually about 28 square meters or less. This is a small fib on the part of management that really is not necessary since the property is really perfect otherwise.",4,2018,07,23
29,A nice place,"We have been in this hotel in July and we had a nice experience.
The hotel is good, clean, classic and beautiful.
Should have a better gym, a swimmingpool with warmed water, and a one star restaurant.
Service is nice.
",4,2018,07,18
29,"Elegant, old world hotel with upscale modern conveniences","This beautiful hotel began its life as a Ritz — and is nearly 100 years old — yet has great modern convenience.   We had a wonderful two night stay in a Classic Art Suite, the Cesar Ritz suite.  It was superb.  The hotel is located within an easy walk of the Gothic Quarter, the Passeig de Garcia, and Las Ramblas.  If you shop like I do you won’t have far to lug your bags!    There are great restaurants within walking distance as well — be sure to seek recommendations from the concierge.  

The lobby is elegant and greets guests with a table laden with beautiful flowers.  The staircase is so elegant — just be careful of the black handrail as it could literally rub onto you (my husband had black on his khaki shorts and hands).   

Our suite faced the front of the hotel with a view of the lively street.  We had plenty of space: large living and dining room, powder room, bedroom and fabulous bathroom with a tub, large shower and Roman shower.  Beautiful fresh flowers were on the dining table as well as the desk in the bedroom.  We felt absolutely welcomed both by the surroundings and most especially by the friendly and warm staff.

A note about the shower - many hotels have inconsistent water pressure and temperature, but not this one.  The shower was so wonderful with such great water from the rainhead shower I didn’t want to emerge.  It was especially wonderful after a long flight from the states!

Breakfast is served in a lovely large patio room.  The buffet has lots of wonderful options and you may also have an omelet or other eggs made to order or other items.  Visit once and your beverage choices will be remembered the next time.   

We were touched by the manager seeking us out our first morning to greet us.  Made us feel as though being there was very special!

The property may not be part of the Ritz collection these days, but the old world charm and elegance remains.  We loved our stay and would most certainly return.",5,2018,07,13
29,Just marvelous ,"Friendly staff and concierge, the rooms were clean and cool! 

We stayed here while traveling from Paris to San Sebastián. We booked 4 rooms for 4 nights and were treated like Royalty. The breakfast was worth paying for if you don’t get it for free.  

Be sure to check out the great pool on the roof. My only complaint is the poolside and rooftop drink service is extremely slow. Most cases our food came before our drink orders and rarely got the opportunity to pair wine or beverages with food.

I will say that their specialty cocktails were worth the wait if you are going for just drinks. Overall a great place to stay and very luxurious and affordable.",5,2018,07,13
29,Unforgettable stay for our first anniversary,"We stayed for 7 days for our first anniversary. The suite was gorgeous, facing the street corner, lots of sunlight and a very quiet room. We met the hotel manager, who was very delightful and charming. We got a couples massage at the spa and it was one of the best I've had, it had a Mayan influence with Mayan music to start the massage. The rooftop restaurant has views of the entire city, you can see La Sagrada Família from there.",5,2018,07,13
29,Great hotel and location,"Exactly what you would expect from a 5* hotel, great staff, great rooms, great location.  You cant go wrong with this place, they cater to your every need.  Make sure you go up to the rooftop bar at night .. and continue up as high as you can get ... awesome view of the entire city!",5,2018,07,11
29,"Great location, classic room value for money - junior suite is not","We had booked two rooms. One was a Classic Room and the other was a Junior Suite. My son was travelling with us and his room - the cheaper of both rooms was a beautiful room and faced the street with plenty of light and was light and roomy and great value for money This was room 604 and it was really nice The junior suite was not very pleasant - the room was lovely inside but it overlooked the inside of the building so you looked directly at the other side of the building wall -Room 628 - I suggest that if you get offered that room as a junior suite do not accept it as it is dark inside and has no view Sadly we paid a significant amount of money for 3 nights stay in the junior room and we would have been better off in a Classic Room. On checkout, I was asked by the receptionist what they could improve on. I tol him about the room and he said it was a compromise for a larger room - I don't want a compromise when I have spent a few thousand dollars to see a building wall After travelling 24 hours from Australia - it was disappointing

The junior suite was not very pleasant - the room was lovely inside but it overlooked the inside of the building so you looked directly at the other side of the building wall -Room 628 Definitely not value for money - you are better off with a Classic Room",3,2018,07,10
29,Very nice stay at an elegant property,"For a one-night stay before a cruise, this hotel offered lovely rooms in a well-maintained property. The terrace pool was great and the bar menu was the most unusual I've ever seen (Margarita in a clear clam shell glass, served in a box!). Breakfast was reasonably priced in a very airy and elegant covered outdoor patio. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Our only problem, and why this is 4-star rather than 5-star review came after our visit. One member of our party left a walking stick behind in the room, which we discovered prior to taking the cruise and shortly after checking out. The front desk said they couldn't find it, but did respond to a subsequent email saying they had it. This belated but good news was followed by information on the price to ship to the U.S., which they quoted as 200 euros. When I complained about this exorbitant price, I never heard back. For a 5-star property, I would have expected better service, both when we were still in town and then with the follow-up email.
The other point, which I added below, is that our room did not have a proper shower but instead a half-glassed in bathtub with a hand-held shower head that was almost impossible to control. Also we only had one vanity. The others in our group had nice overhead rain showers and double vanities.",4,2018,07,08
29,Not the same any more :/,"El Palace is still perfectly situated in Barcelona, with clean and beautiful rooms. But after last visit alot has changed.

The main change is the lounge and bar area. It was so beautiful and grand, but now its gone. The Michelin restaurant has also moved out.

Hopefully they will change it back to its greatness.",3,2018,07,06
29,Really Great Hotel,"We had selected another hotel but our travel agent highly recommended El Palace. She was right. Very large comfortable rooms, Great breakfast And extremely helpful staff. Bell captain gave us a recommendation for a great tapas restaurant within walking distance.  Would stay there again without question.",5,2018,07,01
29,We had the best breakfast of our Spain Trip at this Hotel,"Not a far walk to the historic district. Rooms were nice, breakfast was excellent! Room was clean. A historic hotel. Research your hotels well, because you really won't be spending that much time in your room in Barcelona. Service was excellent.",4,2018,06,27
29,Fantastic place to stay,"Bit pricey, but oh so worth it.  Beautifully appointed rooms, wonderful buffet breakfast and wonderful service.  El Palace is centrally located; three blocks from the subway, the bus stops right in front, 24 minute walk to La Sagrada (2 stops on the train), 15 minute walk to Casa Batlló, 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas or one or two stops on the train.  They have old fashioned room keys which you turn in when you go out for the day and pick up when you return.  Awfully convenient if you are with a group who go to different places and you want to know if they are in their room yet when you return.  We stayed in the family room which was a suite of rooms with their own door and a hallway and a common door.  Genius! I would highly recommend a stay here....oh did I mention the award winning Spa?!?",5,2018,06,26
29,Beautiful overnight,"Beautiful hotel. Centrally located. You can walk to the plaza for restaurants, shopping or tour busses. The restaurant in the hotel was expensive, but there are so many in the area around the hotel. Wonderful bakery right across the street. Some of the best paella within 2 blocks. The service is very friendly.",4,2018,06,18
29,Very Grand and Amazing,"This hotel was like having your own castle. The room was huge with a beautiful bathroom. We had great views of the city too. The people were lovely, the buffet breakfast was beautiful! We loved every minute of our time in Barcelona!",5,2018,06,18
29,Fabulous Afternoon tea,"A group of us went for Afternoon tea at the 5 star El Palace. It was 28 euros each and delicious. A lovely setting, great food and fabulous staff. I would recommend. A great cake selection, scones and lovely sandwiches.  There were cute menus you could take home and such pretty plates and cups. The English breakfast tea was the best I have ever tasted. A good option for a Sunday when many shops are closed in Barcelona.",5,2018,06,17
29,Truley An Amazing Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days whilst in Barcelona. We have stayed many times before and have always enjoyed our time there.
The rooms are very luxurious, spacious and well laid out. The king bed is very large and comfortable with ample pillows. The bathroom is also quite amazing, large bath, separate rain shower and a separate closed-off toilet.
The best part of the hotel though are the warm and friendly staff, second to non, from the moment you arrive, you are treated as royalty.
Breakfast is served in a glass roofed area, a very pretty location. Our only criticism of which is the hot food was not hot, only warm.

A very special mention: sadly whilst exploring the city of Barcelona my wallet was stolen with all my credit cards. Returning to the hotel, we explained our situation, and to our relief and gratitude the staff we both very sympathetic and incredibly helpful. We were given use of their telephone to make several international calls, free of charge, were able to settle our hotel bill even without presenting our credit card and were given a lot of help and support, as well as some calming drinks. The hotel staff were all amazing, in particular Pablo on reception and Amal in the main foyer. Sadly, we cannot recall all of your names, but thank you all for your help and support, you helped change a terrible situation into a less stressful event.
Thank you all again, hope to see you soon.",5,2018,06,16
29,Gorgeous Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,We stayed at the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona in June 2018 and absolutely loved it. The hotel is gorgeous with beautiful rooms and bathrooms. It is also very well located close to Las Ramblas and the main shopping district. The breakfast too is very good and i would strongly recommend it.,5,2018,06,15
29,"Charming, historic hotel","Originally The Ritz in its heyday this charming hotel is full of romance and charm. Lovely breakfast and a short walk from La Rambla - the place to go to see and be seen - and La Boqueria, the food market that is a foodies delight. Delightful stay. Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,15
29,Lovely old ritz,"This hotel is in a great location to major shops, restaurants and points of interest. Beautiful decode with classic styling. Breakfast is comprehensive and there is a great roof top bar with extensive views",5,2018,06,14
29,Outstanding and Beautiful!,"Simply a gorgeous hotel in a great location.  Guest room was large, decorated beautifully and very quiet.  Staff and service was impeccable.  Breakfasts and restaurants were a delight.  Dramatic lobby.  I loved it!",5,2018,06,14
29,"Wonderful hotel, staff and location!",We enjoyed our stay in Barcelona and couldn't have picked a better hotel!  The service was outstanding.  We appreciated the personal touches in the room.  The breakfast was wonderful and dinner on the terrace was amazing!  We will definitely be back.,5,2018,06,14
29,"Excellent, amazing quality, fabulous hotel","My wife and I stayed here for a week, as a birthday treat for my wife and an early wedding anniversary present. The service upon arrival was very welcoming, we were informed that we had been given an upgrade, and the assistance by the concierge and team was wonderful. Our room was located on the 6th floor, facing the front and was perfect. The hotel is very central, allowing us to access all of the main sites, as well as some off-the-beaten track locations. The Concierge team were so helpful making bookings and helping us determine routes. The breakfast was stunning, plenty of choice and always fresh and tasty. My wife and I would strongly recommend this hotel, especially the roof top dining, including the little area right at the top, which gives amazing views across the city.",5,2018,06,11
29,Great Hotel in an excellent location in Barcelona,"Nothing to complain about this Hotel. Excellent Location, great service, nice breakfast. The concierge is also very helpful. Nice restaurant and pool on roof top though pool water was too cold for us.
rooms were quite spacious too",4,2018,06,11
29,Elegance en Espana,"We were upgraded to a junior suite and the rooms were fabulous! The powder room, as well as a full bath were a true bonus. The hotel is elegant, the staff very friendly and the breakfast was impressive. I would definitely recommend El Palace. It is walking distance to the Barrio Gothic and the Picasso Museum. 

We met friends at a terrific restaurant- BotaFumeiro. The food was excellent.",5,2018,06,10
29,Gorgeous,"We stayed here in June 2017. Great location. Gorgeous hotel. Nice people at the front desk. Our room was gorgeous, but didn't offer any views. Stunning interior. The highlight was definitely the rooftop. The view over the city, lovely pool and the stunning Jardin de Diana are amazing. The service at the bar could improve (too slow) and the place gets quite packed in the evening with outside visitors. Other than that our stay was perfect. We walked to all the sightseeing attractions (e.g. Sagrada familia, La ramblas, Casa Battlo, Parc de la Ciutadella, Barri Gòtic,...) Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,05
29,THE MOST UNFOGETTABLE STAY!,"I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in Josephine Baker's suite. The suite was truly fitted for a queen! Also, I have to say, I have stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels and not easily impressed. From arrival to departure they make you feel like royalty. The stuff are most gracious and attentive, the inside of the hotel is like a magnificent palace; luxury and beauty everywhere. They also have a very nice top terrace with a pool and views of Barcelona! Not to mention their top spa in Europe. Simply amazing. The only hotel I would ever stay in Barcelona.",5,2018,05,30
29,One of the Best Hotels in Europe,"Great Location, great Welcome from Amal in the Lobby, fantastic accommodation. Room service is perfect, we enjoyed our first night in the place.
We LOVED the roof top pool, a unique view on Barcelona and a place to rest so quiet in the heart of the city.
Can only recommend such a beautiful property",5,2018,05,30
29,Fantastic stay,"Recently stayed at El Palace, location wise is fantastic is only about three blocks to the left of La Ramblas and centrally located. Staff were very friendly. We went as part of a tour group (Tauck) and they were very accommodating. 

The only thing I would say is if you get the room in the corner on the 3rd floor, the door needs some WD40 or similar as often you need to use a bit of force to get the door open.

Overall, very good hotel!",4,2018,05,28
29,Hotel excellent 5 star,"We stayed at El palace Hotel  on May 13-15, 2018. One of the best hotels I ever stayed at all over the world. Concierge was extremely helpful in suggesting places to eat and purchase souvenirs. Showers were great, beds were firm. Breakfast selection was wonderful. We had to catch an early flight and we were allowed breakfast before the regular opening time. Not all restaurants are that accommodating.  Mirror was the television over the fireplace. Used to be a Ritz hotel.",5,2018,05,28
29,Excellent service..beautiful room,"Was able to get a very good deal on the room rate for 3 nights by booking/paying  well in advance. Exceptional service with only 1 complaint. Breakfast was included for us.
Although the food was excellent....the people who provided the service were like 
ants running around with their heads cut off...and this included the manager of the room who was hard to find.  One was always looking to find a server . Food(eggs) were very late in coming out of the kitchen and several times had to be sent back for being ""overcooked"". Hotel need to make drastic change in this area.",5,2018,05,28
29,A real palace,"Very beautiful and historical hotel with class, nice service and very nice location. Junior Suites are comfortable and the staff is very friendly. With amazingly relaxing rooftop that makes a difference.",5,2018,05,23
29,Stunningly original luxury hotel,"Just wow!
My partner and I have just returned home from here and I’m still in awe!
Beautifully original hotel that just oozes class and style. The staff couldn’t have been more accommodating and friendly, the room and all other areas were tastefully decorated in a modern yet classic.
We had a view of sagrada familia from our balcony, which was a huge unexpected bonus. The rooftop pool and bar is also a must see for views across the city. 
Highly recommended, couldn’t say a bad world about it. Felt like a princess from start to finish!",5,2018,05,16
29,True 5 Star Luxury,"Beautiful historical hotel meticulously restored. Stunning public spaces and rooms with original fireplaces. Added bonus was the private and relaxing rooftop which boasted a pool, gardens and wonderful dining options. The service in all areas was impeccable, concierge was extremely helpful booking us tickets to Girona and reservations at local restaurants. Great value for what you receive. It's the only place I'd stay if I ever return to Barcelona.",5,2018,05,13
29,Exceptional,"My husband and I spent 5 wonderful days at El Palace Hotel in Barcelona. It was truly exceptional from our lovely room, the sumptuous breakfast in the garden cafe, the terrace bar and restaurant, and the downstairs bar and entertainment. But what really sets this hotel apart is the outstanding service. As soon as a request is made, it is fulfilled. We especially appreciated the friendly and excellent service from the Concierge Alexis. He was so helpful and always with a smile and kind word. 
",5,2018,05,02
29,El Palace Hotel in Barcelona,"The El Palace was great. I believe it was a Ritz Carlton back in the day and has been renovated. Plush, classy, old time elegance throughout the hotel. Room was much bigger than the average European hotel room and very comfortable; bathroom was also big with double sinks. Really nice roof deck with a pool and restaurant. Excellent buffet breakfast that was well worth the cost. Hotel staff totally nice and always eager to help. I would highly recommend it.",5,2018,04,30
29,Be treated like Royalty.,"We spent our last night at El Palace Hotel, having stayed in apartments in Barcelona and on the Costa Brava. What a last night in Barcelona. The hotel is in the center of the city. You can walk to many of the main attractions. The staff is exceptional, room was delicious and the atmosphere makes you feel special. The rooftop dining was one of the hi lights of the trip. You have to see it to believe it. A very lovely stay.",5,2018,04,26
29,A classy hotel in the heart of Barcelona ,"This hotel was chosen by my colleague as the place to stay , I was pleasantly surprised , it’s an old building with a lot of character yet with all the modern amenities . Very spacious with a bar and restaurant on the roof top with very helpful staff . Highly recommend it . ",5,2018,04,26
29,Wonderful!,"Have stayed at El Palace 4 times now, every time we have been to Barcelona in recent years.  Hotel and staff are exceptional.  Decor very ornate and feels ever so grand.  

Rooms are spacious enough and good bathrooms.  

Conciege really helpful with getting us restaurant bookings etc and taxi’s and offering general good advice.  

Just love his hotel and can’t wait until next time for a bit of luxury. ",5,2018,04,24
29,Historical Gem,"This dynamic grand hotel from 1919 is not to be missed when staying in Barcelona. Put aside all the art nouveau hotels and enjoy the splendor of the original Ritz hotel creation. The first floor rooms front onto the tree lined vista street and are storybook with 12 foot ceilings , marble baths and free WiFi. The rooftop dining and open air deck have 360 degree vistas of the City and its magnificent architecture. Barcelona truly surprised us with its clean public areas and food markets near La Rambla. Truly, this is a wonderful base if you are planning a cruise from its picturesque port.",5,2018,04,24
29,Outstanding in so Many Way,"Amazing-Luxurious-Pampering-Service

All words that spring to mind from our 4-night stay at Barcelona's original luxury hotel originally built in 1919 and for many years the Barcelona Ritz.  Now a private hotel part of the Leading Hotels of the World consortium you feel special from the moment you arrive.  We booked a junior suite which was massive and located on the 6th floor in a quiet end of the building to treat ourselves at the end of a two-week holiday in Spain.  Yes it was pricey but a year from now we won't be remembering that, just the great stay in Barcelona.

PROS:  (based on our stay in room 619-junior suite).
- HUGE room with a comfortable king-sized bed plus plenty of room for a couch and two chairs
-large walk-in closet (was bigger than the bathroom at our ""luxury"" hotel in Granada
-pillow ""menu"" with six different choice so you are assured a good nights sleep
-massive modern bathroom with nice amenities and double sink
-the double shower was sized for a locker room with a long bench, two overhead rain showers, and two handheld jets.
-our room was very quiet and clean
-bountiful breakfast buffet (included in most but not all room rates-TIP: you can sign up for the Leading Hotels Loyalty program (free for first year) and get free breakfast during your stay if it wasn't already included for you- this is what we did)
-beautiful rooftop terrace with amazing views and a bar-perfect for a cocktail and snack
-live music-evening piano in the lounge and live jazz in the downstairs club and DJ on the roof
-BIGGEST STANDOUT is the STAFF-especially Paco and the entire the concierge staff who are there 24x7 and can book last minute concerts, make reservations and give directions in flawless English-so very service minded and helpful-among the best we've encountered in our travels anywhere

OPPORTUNITIES:  in reality, nothing of consequence-this place is very close to perfect
-I guess I wish the tiny writing on the shampoo bottles was bigger or darker, it was difficult to tell shampoo from body wash but really really minor nit

HIGHLY recommended",5,2018,04,23
29,Wonderful hotel,"We loved every minute there. They rescued us from an almost certain disaster when our “booking “ with a horrible company almost fell through. Agoda was , in my opinion, horrible. 
The staff in the front office  of el Palace couldn’t have been more helpful and efficient. Their breakfast buffet was flawless. I even loved their coffee., The hotel us situated conveniently. The rooms were wonderfully comfortable. I don’t want to forget their wonderful entertainment and bar on the lower level. We highly recommend",5,2018,04,22
29,Comfortable stay,"I stayed in this property via Grand Luxury hotel group who were my agents and indeed a very supportive group and luxury in all aspects.
The hotel had a very old colonial type of a decor but at least we were not very delayed to get a room although we arrived at 10am in the morning and we were welcomed by Ms Amal who took us around the hotel . We were also upgraded to a superior suite as most of the junior suites in Europe do not have a separate living room from the bedroom and this was one of my requirements to have a separate bed room from the living area. We had also requested a connecting room which they did not have one with the suite but they upgrade the classic room also to a junior suite.
The door key was a nuisance honestly we really had to struggle to open the door each time as it was the traditional old design style  and had to return to the concierge each time you left the hotel.
The bathroom was nice and I really like the idea of having the closets inside the bathroom ,although the lighting was very dim and dark and me with a vision problem I honestly just do not like black tiles and dark lighting ,, I really want a bright lit room and bathroom tiles with bright colours preferably white or beige.
The housekeeping were really friendly and helpful only problem was their stinginess on giving drinking water which honestly I refuse to understand. Nowadays honestly I request all the hotels to offer complimentary water which is an essential element and a necessity to all the guests and the according to my experience suite room guests should have a privilege of receiving complimentary water regardless of the amount.
and I had a leg injury and needed to take lots of medication and they really made a fuss of offering us water! They claimed maximum only 6 bottles a day also they had no  classy tea coffee amenities. 
The bathroom amenities were nice.and they had a hand shower in the WC which was great really.
The breakfast staff were very friendly and welcoming and knew the guests by the name.
The best surprise was they had Halal items which was wonderful and the spread was very nice.
We only had a problem with our train booking by one of the concierge staff when we planned to travel to Madrid on the 8th of April and he by mistake booked us for the 6th and that too it was a non refundable one. .I must admit it was also our mistake of not double checking the reservation details and taken it for granted by blindly trusting the concierge .We were shocked that upon arrival to the station we were refused by the check in staff that the tickets had an expired date and immediately we had to rush and purchase 4 new tickets and we were lucky to get seats on the train.I first called my GLH Guest Experience Manager, Ms Céline who I must admit and honor her as THE most supportive manager throughout my journey she immediately communicated with the hotel and assured me that they will sort out the problem in no time 
We also  called the hotel and informed them of what happened with us and I must say they were very kind and supportive and agreed to refund back all our 4 tickets which we were really very impressed and touched by their superb service but we really do not want any of the staff to be accountable for that because mistakes to happen .I received an email from Jean-Marie Le Gall,Director General and General Manager of the hotel to apologise for the inconvenience and to assist us with the refund and also apologised of the mistake which was caused and indeed we were really appreciative of their superb service.",3,2018,04,19
29,Elegant with great staff,Spent 5 days here.  From the moment you walk in it comes across as a great boutique hotel that really feels like a family place as the staff are so friendly.  Hard to realise this hotel was built in 1919 100 years ago.  Large room but very modern with it recent refit. Breakfast is delightful with something for everyone.   Don’t miss the bar in the basement.  Very special and cosy. ,5,2018,04,12

Everyone in Barcelona should  really 
visited

29,"Gorgeous Hotel, Incredible Breakfast!","We stayed at the Palace Hotel in Barcelona for three nights and the staff, room, and public areas were superb. We have stayed at our share of Luxury Hotels in Europe but this one rises above the fray with their breakfast. Yes, breakfast! What a spread, and every possible customary breakfast food for most of the world was represented. First of all the room where it is served is fit for a royal audience and the staff couldn't have been more attentive. The food ranged from beautiful breads and pastries, meats and cheeses, hot cereals, made to order eggs,a variety of smoked fish and their accompanying relishes, to Japanese soup, dumplings, rice. The only other hotel I can think of that came close was The Palace in Stockholm. Best part was it was included with our hotel stay. What a great start to the day!",5,2018,04,09
29,Elegant Hotel with Fantastic Service and Delicious Food,"I highly recommend a stay at this hotel while visiting Barcelona.  Everything was top notch, from the attentive and accommodating service of the Concierge and wait staff to the beautiful lobby and meeting areas and excellent cuisine.  The hotel is also conveniently located, even walking distance from many tourist attractions including Las Ramblas, The Marina/Beach, and other points of interest.  Besides the very good breakfast buffet, we ate dinner at the hotel one night and the food was excellent, as was the light and fluffy cheesecake we had for dessert.  ",5,2018,04,08

29,A must if staying in Barcelona!,"This hotel is the best hotel I have stayed in. It’s perfect for exploring as it is walking distance from most places. The staff are wonderful and The hotel is spotlessly clean. We are already planning our next visit back as we can’t wait to go and stay again. The cocktail bar has a great vibe with live music on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays. The terrace is perfect for relaxing on. All staff are very polite and attentive. I cannot fault this hotel!

29,50th Birthday ,"Having done some research given that I was returning to Barcelona for my 50th, I chose this Hotel and I was not disappointed. It is welcoming, friendly and my biggest shout out goes to Julie the Guest Relations Manager, who, on hearing it was my birthday arranged a surprise to be delivered to my room. She has been lovely and attentive and the best part of the stay. I would recommend this hotel for it hospitality, it’s location, it’s service and it’s thoughtfulness 
You can even see Sagrada Familia from their rooftop restaurant ",5,2018,03,13
29,Superb staff and location,"Staff were very attentive and helpful, went beyond to make our stay very special. Location was superb, maximum 20 mins walk from most key attractions. Room was a very high standard. Overall a very special stay and strongly recommend",5,2018,03,04
29,A very civilised experience,"Aptly named, El Palace is a regal building from top to bottom.  The public areas are splendidly decorated, without being completely overwrought.  Guest rooms are equally stately, but also relaxing places to be.  

I had dinner at L’éclair restaurant, which was very good and reasonably priced.  Service in the restaurant, and throughout the hotel, was unfailingly polite and welcoming.

El Palace is a departure from my usual diet of boutique style hotels.  However, where a hotel is a landmark in itself, I usually find it’s worth a stay.  This certainly proved to be the case with El Palace.",5,2018,03,01
29,"Amazing hotel, amazing experience !","We had an amazing stay in this historical hotel of Barcelona. 
The welcome was really warm, the people very profesional and the hotel is just fantastic. We had the chance to stay in the Ronnie Wood suite which is absolutely gorgeous !
I definitely recommend the Palace to enjoy the soul of Barcelona.",5,2018,02,28
29,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","El Palace Hotel is absolutely beautiful and was is a great location.  It is easy walking distance from Las Ramblas, the Arc de Triomp, the cable car, the Picasso Museum, the Barcelona Cathedral, and high end shopping.  The breakfast was a thing of beauty with a huge variety.  The fitness center is very small and felt cramped.  That was my only disappointment.",5,2018,02,24
29,Gorgeous hotel ,"Very expensive but worth the price.  Great location just a short distance for all of the major sights. A ten minute walk from Passages de Gracia and about a fifteen minute walk from Las Ramblas.
 The hotel is very sumptuous and elegantly decorated in a formal, Spanish decor. If you don’t like velvet, this is not the place for you. When I first saw the photos, I was a little unsure, but in person, it was quite elegant.
Our room was very large and also elegant, with every convenience and luxury you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. The only thing missing in the room was a coffee maker.
When I made the reservation, I mentioned I was disappointed about not having a coffee maker, and they surprised me when i arrived with a coffee machine and a lovely coffee service.
This  was a lovely and very accommodating surprise!
The breakfast served in their gorgeous breakfast room was one of the best we ever had anywhere. The price we were quoted included breakfast.
The staff were all top notch, very friendly, courteous, and accommodating, especially the manager at the time , who made those special arrangements for our en suite coffee!
Although this hotel was expensive, it was definitely worth it!

29,Regal for a Queen,"It was mt significant others ( 2year girlfriend) 1st trip to Spain. We were to pick up a Seaborne cruise in a few days. The hotel is like a dream, so beautiful with its great room with 20 or more intimate sitting areas. Quaint and elegant. The Spanish culture is very classic and elegant in speech and mannerisms.
Our stay was incredible, they gave us an upgrade to the Ron Woods suite. He is the Rolling Stone musician. OMG, We flipped and to say the least impressed by their generosity and saw how excited we were for the honor.
In addition , breakfast was also an experience. Wonderful interaction with the staff; they are a proud people and so eager to share their knowledge of their most beautiful city.
Gaudi who we love and got to know more, is outstanding. What a major contributor to the world. A true pioneer.
When I return to Barcelona I will be in El Palace and go to Dali again.",5,2018,02,16
29,YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED,"We stayed here 5 nights prior to our cruise The location is very central within walking distance to many attractions  We stayed in a spacious, comfy, quiet room overlooking a busy street, but no noise, only when opening the window. The room had a walk in wardrobe and a spacious bathroom. A magnificent breakfast was had each morning. Would definitely recommend and we will be staying there again.",5,2018,02,13
29,Timeless luxury and exceptional service,"My husband and I stayed here for an anniversary trip to Barcelona. The El Palace hotel was beautiful. The rooms were completed with modern touches to keep a timeless decor (tv behind a mirror, mini bar behind a painting)-- it was charming. The staff anticipated our needs before we asked- an umbrella over your head, a door held open, and after a few days our room keys without telling them the number. The restaurant cooked delicious food and the staff helped with suggestions for what to order on the menu and an introduction to their wine offerings before we selected a glass. My only complaint: They set the bar so high it was hard to enjoy the other hotels we stayed in across the country as much! I would stay again and recommend it in a heartbeat.",5,2018,02,05
29,Mr.Ali Al-Marafi," I was a recent client for your hotel is Barcelona. I am sending this note today to share with you my sincere thanks and appreciation for the lovely experience I had in the hotel. All staff were very accommodating and helpful. We felt a great comfort while being at your hotel.

The common areas were gorgeous and architecturally notable with hand tooled walls, expansive high ceilings and intricate design and details. The interior design is just beautiful with numerous comfortable, but regal sitting areas. The rooms and baths are lovely. We literally didn't have to open a door or push a button. There were appx. 2 servers at the ready anticipating our every move, happily and cheerfully serving our every need. The breakfast buffet was amazing, delicious food, plentiful, varied and again, the service was perfect! We will be back! Thank all of you who helped us make memories.

29,Will stay nowhere else!,"Anyone going to Barcelona simply must stay at El Palace. This is an absolutely stunning hotel. 
We stayed on the 5th floor with windows facing the front of the hotel with a stunning view, including the top of Sagrada Familia! El Palace is located in a brilliant location...a little bit removed from the major street, but is a mere two block walk to the centre of the city. A short two block walk to the Hop-On Hop-Off tour buses. Two Gaudi buildings within walking distance of the hotel also. Food at the hotel is superb, service is impeccable, and they never forgot that I was a celiac with food restrictions. They accommodated me without blinking an eye - even brought in gluten free bread for me each morning for breakfast! Unreal! 
Our rooms were maintained to perfection, including evening turn-down service, and full bathroom scrubbing every day. Double sink, with lovely deep tub, and a connected shower, and a separate lavatory room.
The rooftop pool was lovely with stunning views both day and night. A little chilly for swimming in December, but my boys had a quick polar jump in and out and loved it.
The staff at the concierge desk were stupendous. Excellent restaurant recommendations that did not disappoint. They are so knowledgeable about everything you need or want to know.
The drive from airport to hotel is about 30 minutes. 
El Palace is superb. No need to look anywhere else!  This is the only hotel we will ever stay at when we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,12,26

Highly recommend the hotel, to its spa and off course cocktail bar. ~The food is also excellent.",5,2017,12,19
29,"luxurious, convenient and perfect choice for Barcelona","We loved our luxurious accommodations in Barcelona at the Palace hotel. The rooms are beautiful and the staff bent over backwards to be helpful. Its on a main street so with windows open, its a bit loud, but you will love the location despite this. Walking distance to the old city and las rambles plus the heart of the shopping district and wonderful restaurants. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,11,26

We ate at the breakfast buffet which was delicious as well as the poolside restaurant which was pretty good. We will definitely be staying here in future travels! ",5,2017,11,21
29,Recommended hotel in a great location,"A classic Euro hotel. We stayed 3 nights here and nothing went wrong. Centrally located in Barcelona, staff was immaculate and food was great. We dined in on our first night, restaurant was closed so we ate at the bar, although a bit pricey it was certainly worth it!

We were located on the 4th floor at the end and was very quiet. Rooms were clean and did not find any issues with cleanliness. The bathroom amenities were great, the shower spacious!",5,2017,11,11
29,Business Trip,"Overall the hotel is clean and runs smoothly, The staff are efficient and pleasant.  The breakfast was buffet style, and the choice was varied.  The hotel was impersonal - maybe this was due to a language barrier?  The resturant is shut on a Monday evening, so we ate in the bar area, the menu was okay, and the food was enjoyable.",4,2017,11,08
29,Excellent value for money and 5 star !,"Old world charm in the city center of  Barcelona. Excellent WiFi .The staff is awesome and all speak English. Lovely bedroom and comfortable bed, Chopard amenities in bathroom. The breakfast was one of the best I ever had. We stayed 2 nights and paid for half day late check out 19.30 - very reasonable. Walking distance from all major attractions, shops and transport. Will stay there anytime! Housekeeping staff the best ! Thank you🤗",5,2017,11,01
29,Great hotel in a great lacation,We just spent 3 nights at the El Palace hotel and can't say enough good things about our stay. The room was lovely and very quiet. Breakfast which was included because we booked through the hotel's website was terrific . the Location can't be beaten and the staff especially the concierge was very helpful. I would definitely return. This is our 4th time in Barcelona and this was definitely our best hotel.,5,2017,10,28
29,A quality hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights in this fabulous hotel.
From check in to departure everything was first class.
The roof top pool and bar afforded great views over the City.
Breakfast was delightful.
Centrally placed for all of this City centre sites,we could not fault this 5 star hotel.",5,2017,10,25
29,Excellent views,Great rooftop pool with a lovely terrace where you can enjoy a Thursday afternoon with a glass of good wine and and exclusive life show. Great service. If it gets chilly they offer you a blanket. I recommend this place.,5,2017,10,23
29,Our stay in El Palace hotel....,"El Palace is a beautiful hotel, conveniently located and has very attentive service. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. The roof bar is very lovely and gives you a good view of the city. In the downstairs bar we listened blues and jazz. Beautiful experience!",5,2017,10,22
29,Highest standard,"The former Ritz Hotel, the El Palace has maintained a position as a quality destination in one of Spain's most engaging cities.
Service levels here are of the highest standard.Dining options range from grand to smart casual. Breakfasts are relatively expensive but memorable for their range of choice and presentation. The rooms are tasteful with linen of the finest quality and bathrooms vast with rain shower and spa bathing options.
This is an old-style hotel, proud of its history and determined to preserve it. The location is central but just shy of the tourist hordes a block away.
Any guest seeking an alternative to the hotel menus and wanting a simple, well-cooked steak, should consider the argentinian restaurant Patagonia Beef and Wine, across the road from El Palace main entrance.",5,2017,10,22
29,Three Delightful Nights in Barcelona,"The room was exquisite with the best mattress of our 12 days in Spain, good amenities, and quiet.  The staff is exceptional - approachable, attentive, eager to help, and very knowledgeable about navigating Barcelona.  Every restaurant recommendation the concierge team provided was great - they listened to what we wanted and zeroed in on options that met our needs.  I would suggest skipping the hotel breakfast and going across the street to the bakery or breakfast place, but absolutely do visit the rooftop bar and the basement lounge (great live music on Saturday, great mixology, and great conversations with fellow travelers).",5,2017,10,21
29,Elegant hotel in perfect location!,"El Palace is a luxury hotel at the high end of our price range, but it was well worth every penny/euro!

 We had certain criteria in our choice of hotels. They must have a good TripAdvisor rating; must have a lift and air-conditioning; must be within walking distance (1-2 miles) of many sites we wanted to visit; must offer a breakfast option; and must have a degree of concierge service -- English speaking staff who can assist in offering restaurant recommendations, making restaurant reservations, calling taxis and providing good, detailed walking directions.

El Palace easily exceeded all of our expectations. It is indeed palatial and elegantly appointed throughout. We booked the Classic Deluxe with breakfast. The rooms was large by European standards, the king bed was very comfortable, there was a walk-in closet and the bathroom had both a tub and a walk-in shower with two separate shower heads. Robes and slippers were nice amenities.

Breakfast was good and plentiful, with many hot and cold items.

Perhaps best of all was the excellent staff. From the doormen to the check-in receptionist to the concierge staff, all were consistently warm, welcoming and accommodating. The concierge staff was the best we have encountered in our travels through Spain and Italy. At most any hour of the day or evening, there were one or more concierge staff available to answer questions or assist in making arrangements, so there was never a wait for service. The concierge staff had even arranged a guide for us to tour Guell Park and Sagrada Familia (These arrangements we made in advance of our trip).

The hotel is very conveniently located just a short walk from Placa de Catalunya, and from there we strolled down Las Ramblas and walked to the Barri Gotic and El Born districts, as well as to numerous other sites and restaurants.

This hotel sets the bar pretty high for us, and we would return in a heartbeat!",5,2017,10,20
29,GOOD,"From the beginning when u step into the hotel you feel luxury, personal which meets you is super nice and friendly! The smell of the hotel is really good! Rooms are really new and bathrooms are really innovative! Breakfast is in the beautiful garden and food which have been served there is really delicious, there you can find anything what you want.",5,2017,10,19
29,"Excellent Hotel, Best Location...",True 5 star experience. The hotel has that old time feel but everything is new. Great showers and small touches to make you stay more memorable. The terrace is fantastic and a pretty decent breakfast. Highly recommended...,5,2017,10,18
29,FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE ,"We didn’t stay at El Palace, but visited twice as we stayed nearby.  If we return to Barcelona, I would definitely like to stay here.  We had cocktails the first night and were so impressed we booked for dinner the following night, which happened to be my birthday.  The staff were professional, yet friendly.  On the night of my birthday the waiters brought out a slice of delicious chocolate birthday cake and two glasses of cava.  Later in the bar we were given two cocktails.  

The hotel is luxurious and spotlessly clean.  I thoroughly recommend staying here.",5,2017,10,17
29,Perfection,"This hotel has it all..location, service, style, history, large rooms and great food! Just love the hotel, they cannot do enough to make you feel like you are a guest in their home!

A good selections of restaurants from fine dining to great dining, including a rooftop bar and downstairs jazz club! As you can see we had a wonderful time here and will be back!",5,2017,10,17
29,A fantastic hotel on every level,"Highly recommend. Big, luxurious rooms and a gorgeous opulent hotel.  Tucked away downstairs is a 5 star nightclub, bar with singers and was the most enjoyable experience. Perfect location - can walk to almost everything.",5,2017,10,17
29,Wonderful Palace Hotel,"Great service.  The man at reception actually walked a few blocks to help us elderly woman find an ATM machine and showed us how to use it.  The concierge service was exceptional.  If I return to Barcelona, I will definitely book The Palace again. ",5,2017,10,11
29,"Exceptional hotel - Room, Service, Restaurant, attitude","We were in Barcelona Sept 30 through October 3, 2017. While it was a time of political turmoil in Barcelona, the service, accommodations and food at this hotel were exceptional. Greeted by name in the restaurant each morning. Rooms were large and comfortable. Two sinks in the bathroom. Rain shower. All amenities in a location within walking distance of great restaurants and a number of the tourist areas. Highly recommended - we would go back!",5,2017,10,10
29,Fabulous 5* hotel,"Totally recommend a stay here.  Excellent location, with fabulous, opulent common areas and suburb rooms.  We stayed in a junior suite, which was enormous and very comfortable.  All staff we dealt with were fabulous.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,08
29,Outstanding Hotel,"Excellent hotel for couples. The lobby and main room are fabulous. The room was surprisingly big, quiet and slept very well. All the staff were friendly, extremely helpful and very fast when asked to do something.

Close to the metro but easy walking distance to la Rambla, dining, shopping Sagrada Familia and other site seeing.",5,2017,10,07
29,Barcelona,"This is really a grand hotel. It was in a great location, could walk to most places.Breakfast was very good in a lovely garden room, it was fig seasons , and their was an abundance each morning. We were given a upgrade to a lovely room. The service at the front desk was very efficient.",5,2017,10,05
29,Hen Do - Afternoon Tea,"a group of 9 of us visited, we really enjoyed our afternoon tea, there was a wide range of different tea's available, i had a hot chocolate which was very rich, i would recommend trying. All the different elements of the tea where very nice and there was a good selection. At no point did we feel rushed and took our time. the setting is beautiful and the staff are really helpful in telling you what is in each of the cakes/sandwiches etc on the afternoon tea.",4,2017,10,04
29,Amazing rooms.  Wonderful staff.  Highly recommend.,"This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  If you ever have a chance to visit Barcelona Spain, I recommend you book at this historic hotel.  You will not be disappointed.   The staff is amazing.  The food superb. The rooms luxurious.  Best of all, the hotel is within a 15 minute walking distance to all the tourist must see sights.",5,2017,10,03
29,Excellent service,we stayed two nights at El Palace and received the best service.  We ate twice at the hotel and the meals were delicious and staff were so helpful and accommodating.  Our room was very quiet and had every amenity.   We would recommend El Palace without reservation!    ,5,2017,10,01
29,"Old World Style, Modern Conveniences","Fantastic stay.  This is the original Ritz from 1919, and the hotel does a great job of keeping maintaining an old world atmosphere.  The service is top notch and everything functions as in the modern world, so it gives you the best of old and new.  Alex at the concierge is excellent, and all the servers in the breakfast room are top notch.  The breakfast is good and the room itself is beautiful and relaxing - a wonderful start to the day.  The room was decent size, nicely decorated, and functional for storage.  The bathroom is clean, modern, and more American in style.  Overall a wonderful experience, we would happily stay here again.",5,2017,09,30
29,A new favorite!!!,"Expected El Palace to be top notch based on reviews and recommendation, and we were not disappointed! It's a beautiful hotel in a wonderful Barcelona location. It is old world (was formerly Ritz) with just enough modern to be everything a traveler would want (traditionally appointed rooms with modern bathrooms). Our favorite spot by far was the Winter Garden room for breakfast each day - a happy spot for delicious and varied breakfast options. Roof top was lovely, but cozy, offering nice views of the city. Staff throughout the hotel was welcoming, we especially appreciated Alex at the concierge desk for his helpful recommendations and assistance. If we needed to taxi to a destination, it was less than 10 Euro, including Beach, Casino and Park Guell. Hope to visit Barcelona again, and El Palace is where I want to stay!",5,2017,09,30
29,Rob,Very nice hotel in old style but the best. A very good view bar and restaurant on the roof terrace.  The lobby is exquisitely decorated.  Breakfast is always the best either buffet or ordering.  Rooms quiet with nice Windows to outside.  No air shaft view like the Majestic Hotel.,5,2017,09,26
29,Fabulous,"Fabulous hotel, attentive and professional staff. Great location that's close to all of Barcelona's attractions. Hotel amenities include a Spa, Gymnasium, swimming pool and 2 restaurants. I would definately recommend.",5,2017,09,26
29,Grandeur!,"An amazingly beautiful old-world style hotel with good service, great breakfast buffets, and very comfortable beds and bathrooms. Rooms are not large and street noise can be considerable, but we loved the centrality of the location and the plushness of the public areas.",4,2017,09,25
29,Excellent hotel with the old world charm,"We learnt when we first arrived that the El Palace was originally the Ritz hotel and we can understand why. This hotel is full of that Old World charm, lots of beautiful public areas, timber paneling and deep sofas. 
We had booked for 4 nights. Our room on the 6 th floor overlooked the busy street below. An initial concern about traffic noise was soon allayed as the double glazing helps reduce the noise dramatically. 
The room was a good size, with a fantastic king bed, lounge chairs and a good size bathroom, with bath and separate shower. 
The hotel has three bars, with one on the rooftop, with great views.
We ate at the main restaurant on the ground floor and had lunch at the rooftop bar, both excellent. 
Breakfast is a buffet which is vast in hot and cold selections and generally of good quality. We were a little disappointed with the cost for the buffet though and for the next three days ate across the side street at the Alsur cafe that had a great breakfast menu and do much cheaper.
Overall a very enjoyable at a hotel that is very profession in every way.",5,2017,09,24
29,Old World Luxury ,"Absolutely stunning hotel, amazing service from everyone.
Breakfast was excellent, good espresso and great buffet options as well as items made to order. Fresh orange juice was delicious, and the almond croissants, mmmmm!
Room was fabulous, bed very comfy, amazing bathroom wit double rainhead shower.
I would definitely return if the opportunity arises.",5,2017,09,19
29,"Luxurious, old school charm","I have to say this hotel doesn't only have top notch service and excellent facilities, it is visually stunning in terms of decor. Apparently it used to be The Ritz, which explains the old school opulence. Everything, from the welcome we received at the reception, to the Bloody Mary we enjoyed right before we left, was impeccable.

Honestly I didn't want to leave. ",5,2017,09,18
29,5 Star Palace ,"My family and I booked the palace for 4 nights. It was our first time staying in Barcelona and there were many hotel choices and we are very happy we selected El Palace . It was spotless , classy , friendly , the service was amazing and they treated my family and I very special for the time we were there . They have an amazing secret garden like rooftop with music , pool , cocktails and food that is just wonderful . They are also just minutes from all the sites. We  had such a great experience we will absolutely be back on our next Barcelona visit - which will be soon . ",5,2017,09,17
29,Amazing!!,"It's our first time to visit Barcelona. the hotel experience that Miss Amal gave us was more than amazing made the trip worth it even more.
Lots of friends and family asked me through the pictures and videos I shared via Snapchat what's this gorgeous hotel.
The hotel couldn't be more hospitality without Miss Amal. 
She was really helpful since we came for a hospital appointment. She helped in all ways. 
I would defiantly come again to be hosted by Miss Amal and this hotel. 
Alanoud AlHajri",5,2017,09,16
29,Distinctive Hotel with History,"The hotel was built in 1919 and hosts a dining area with the name nineteen/19. It is a former Ritz with the glamour of years past. Exceptional high main areas elegantly appointed. We arrived around noon and had to refuse our first room offered due to a perfumed smell. This smell permeates much of the hotel and we were told it is in the spray used for cleaning carpets. I do believe many Americans would find it difficult to deal with. Our patience for a refreshed room took hours and dashed our hopes for a day of touring. However, the personal service of hostess, Amal, was exceptional. A bottle of champagne and chocolates were delivered to our room to ameliorate our earlier displeasure. This hotel wishes to please. 
Enjoy a splendid rooftop bar and restaurant with a complete view of the city. Turn to any of the savvy concierges for advice. Tony must love food for he provided us with excellent recommendations. El Yantar de la Ribera, for example. 
El Palce is centrally located for shopping, touring and walking.",4,2017,09,16
29,Perfectly located and managed,"Wonderful hotel set perfectly to walk around Barcelona. The staff cannot do enough for you and the breakfast choice is a very good start to your day. The centrepiece is the amazing lounge that we sat in every evening and had cocktails - a throwback to the wonderful 30's! Rooms are well proportioned, big bathrooms and deep comfortable beds.",5,2017,09,16
29,Old World Hotel in Great Location,"We loved the central location of this hotel. The rooms were very well appointed with a very comfortable bed and large bathroom. The gym could have been better, but it was standard for European hotels. The roof deck had lovely views and dipping pool. We ate at the roof restaurant and food was decent with slow  service.  The hotel had great suggestions for restaurants nearby. The concierges were so friendly and helpful, one of our favorite things of the hotel. Overall a very good stay.",4,2017,09,13
29,Everything done PERFECTLY,"This hotel was a splurge on our trip, but totally worth it.  Everything this place does is done well, with no pretence or falseness and done effortlessly.  It's a well-oiled machine.

We arrived in Barcelona by plane and caught the bus to Placa Catanya and from there it was a short, easy walk to the hotel.  The first thing that struck me about the hotel was the number of well dressed staff around and they are friendly, attentive and it's never forced.  They are simply good people, doing a great job and with fierce pride.

This hotel was apparently the Ritz when it opened in 1919 and it still continues to exude this charm.  Please don't think that I mean old fashioned; I mean charming, classy and magnificent.  What you see when you first enter the hotel is repeated on every level of every floor and the detail is outstanding. The rooms are of a great size and the bed and pillow selection is wonderful.  You'll get a great nights sleep as the room is dark, quiet and comfortable.  The room has lovely furniture and artwork and has all the necessities.  The bathroom is large and also beautifully appointed and for me - most importantly - well lit. Lovely toiletries too.

Go up to the roof on level 7 and even if you don't have a swim in the pool, you'll enjoy the view over the roofs over Barcelona. 

Breakfast is served downstairs and is tasty with lots of choices.  Like the rest of the hotel, great service is provided.  Savour all the experiences.  I wish I'd had more time to eat at the restaurant or drink at the bar.  Those will have to wait for next time. 

The most important thing I can praise is the staff and the lengths they go to to make your stay enjoyable.  I can't rate this place more highly. Five stars isn't enough of a superlative.  ",5,2017,09,08
29,Wonderfull roof,"We went to the 7th floor to the restaurant as winter garden!
It Was my birthday!!!
Victor Leon was great as the host of the rooftop!!
He made us feel welcomed and comfortable, in this amazing restaurant with a great setting.

The food was amazing, giving us a special taste of the very multidimensional culinary of Barcelona.

A must for anyone visiting. A great and accessible option is the executive menu, which provides an entry, the main dish and a desert, along with a glass of wine and water for 29€.

Strongly Recommend ",5,2017,09,06
29,Amazing experience!,The hotel is very well located and the terrace has exceptional views. Staff members were exceedingly polite particularly Margot at the concierge desk. She went out of her way to book the rest of our trip and spent a great deal of time with us to figure out the rest of our travel booking. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and especially Margot!,5,2017,09,02
29,Amazing,"Top staff, service, style! Nothing too much trouble. Rooms are good size all in classic style very well kept. Such comfortable beds after a day strolling around Barcelona. Pretty good location can grab a taxi out front easily.

29,All around magnificent stay!,"Excellent service and attention to detail from the moment we arrived and right to the end. So many good things to say about this property, highly recommend! A special shout out to Alejandro on the 7th floor, awesome customer service!",5,2017,09,01
29,50 years of traveling - best hotel service ever,"Been all over US. Been to England, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Never, ever encountered service so exceptional. From Bellman, to front desk to housekeeping. How about heading tired toward an elevator and having someone suddenly push the button. Three nights of restaurant recommendations, all spot on. Housekeeping went way beyond your typical hotel. Every member of that hotel staff epitomized what the word ""service""  means. Would come back in a heart beat. Although hard to imagine any stay could match our amazing 6 days at El Palace.",5,2017,08,30
29,Comfortable Classy Oasis,"My wife and I stayed at the El Palace for 13 nights in mid-August. We arrived late and they gave us a tour of the hotel and upgraded us to a suite with a complimentary bottle of Cava. The next day and throughout our visit we dined at the breakfast buffet on the ground floor. Like many classy hotels we were given the opportunity to order specialty coffees (e.g. Cappuccino), omelettes, and juices (e.g. Carrot) - - even gluten free bread. The breakfast spread was impressive with several selections of fresh: fruit; pastries and breads; eggs and breakfast meats; cheeses; salad items; and, pot stickers/dumplings. The rooms and common areas have been recently remodeled and are kept clean and fresh. The beds are very comfortable and the bed linens very high quality and soft. There is a spacious roof top deck for sun bathing, reading and swimming in the compact pool. There is also food service (lunch, dinner, snacks) available up on the roof with amazing views of all of Barcelona. Most importantly, the entire service staff is well trained, polite, accommodating and kind. They aim to please. The Concierge staff is very knowledgeable and freely hand out advice and maps to get you to restaurants, shopping, attractions, and tours. Well done El Palace, we appreciate you very much and highly recommend a stay here.",5,2017,08,30
29,Miss,"Amazing hotel and true 5 star. We have been travelling since 11 August - best hotel so far! Welcoming, excellent standard and service and just beautiful! Congrats to all the excellent staff members! Food is also excellent. Very high standard and service and I could easily rate 6 star. Location is ideal and we can't ask for better hospitality! Well done!",5,2017,08,26
29,Old World Elegance,"Upon entering I was a bit surprised that the registration area and lobby were so small.However, upon entering the main hotel we were taken with the expansive casual area, and after some meandering coming to the light and airy Breakfast Garden which welcomed you. The staff were both warm and welcoming which was a hallmark of the experience. The rooms were comfortable and reminiscent of old world elegance and luxury.
Especially not to be missed are the rooftop Winter Garden Restaurant and the Bluesman Cocktail Bar. The Winter Garden Restaurant provides a beautiful panoramic view of the city in the framework of a rooftop garden setting which cannot be forgotten. The Bluesman Bar with its live jazz and blues entertainment provides a very intimate and warm ambiance that is seldom found. A must!
The location is excellent with easy access to so many of Barcelona's charms whether you wish to explore history or just shop. All within walking distance.
All in all a great hotel.",5,2017,08,22
29,Well located high quality hotel in a central location,"We stayed here in a February, the staff were very helpful, the bedroom was fitted out to a high standard in an old fashioned way. Breakfasts were excellent together with the evening meals in the restaurants. Happy to recommend.",5,2017,08,21

29,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I began our European trip with a stay in the Palace.  It could not have been a better beginning.  The location is perfect: within walking distance of so many tourist sites, excellent restaurants and good shopping.  The staff couldn't do enough for us to be sure we enjoyed our visit to Barcelona and their beautiful hotel.  The rooftop plunge pool and garden eatery offered good food, comfortable seating and great views.",5,2017,08,16

TOP DRAW!",5,2017,08,16
29,"Warm, welcoming, well positioned hotel","Our visit to Barcelona was made perfect by our choice of hotel! We were within walking distance of many points of interest & delicious eateries. Our deluxe room was very comfortable, and dinner at the winter garden, overlooking the pool & the beautiful city of Barcelona was world class. (Best boned duck I've ever had!)

But the stand out feature at El Palace was the staff, who, without exception, really looked after us, & in such a caring way!! I had the misfortune to be unwell during our stay there, but a very professional doctor was summonsed without delay, & I was back on track in no time!!",5,2017,08,13
29,Fantastic,"El Palace is just fantastic. We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 9 days. Everything was just perfect.

Fine dining at Caelis, great drinks in the bar and roofgarden - wow!

The hotel had a great location, with short walks to all that Barcelona has to offer.

I will definitely stay here again!",5,2017,08,10
29,Elegant ,"Visited August 2017 and have to say my expectations were totally exceeded. Hotel is elegant with fabulous appointments. Our bathroom was contemporary and had the best shower. Swam in the roof top pool overlooking the city. Staff was outstanding. This place was great and my wife and I enjoyed our stay prior to boarding cruise ship for vacation.
100% exceeded expectations from hotel appointments, staff, and amenities! Hotel is centrally located and concierge staff along with Juan and Eric really made our stay fabulous. Thank you!!!",5,2017,08,08
29,We were treated like royalty!,"As hoteliers we can appreciate a well run establishment!  The El Palace is an amazing experience as it blends the elegance  and of yesteryear with all of the conveniences and comfort of the present.  The service was top notch in all respects, from our first contact with Marta Camacho to our friendly greeting by the doorman and concierge, Julie as well as  front desk staff, we knew we were in for a treat!  The suite appointments were perfect, elegant and spotless.  The Operations Manager, Mr. Jaume Donjo, provided us with a welcome gift to make sure we felt special.  Our breakfasts each morning (we stayed 3 nights) were fit for a king!  
The El Palace is in a perfect central location to tour beautiful Barcelona.  
If you travel to Barcelona we highly recommend that you treat yourself to a truly memorable hospitality experience!  The roof bar with its glorious garden, views and tapas are not to be missed.  We concur that The El Palace Hotel is definitely one of ""The Leading Hotels in the World""!",5,2017,08,07
29,Beautiful monument in the heart of Barcelona ,"What an amazing piece of art in the heart of Barcelona!
Every detail is well thought of, from the decoration (impressive) , big size of the rooms the roof top terrace with a panoramic view of Barcelona (best view actually)to the extremely respectful staff , the professionalism of the concierge who were very helpful in giving the needed guidance... surely the palace hotel made our stay my husband and I memorable in Barcelona 
The location as well is perfect: 5mn walking distance to catalunya place or passeias de Garcia and yet very quiet environment.
I highly recommend this hotel for couples/ families or any person looking to have a great stay in Barcelona because this hotel will make sure to fulfill all the needs of their customers .

29,Nice location with friendly staff,"I just returned from a stay at the El Palace Hotel. I was most impressed with the staff, who truly tried their best to make our stay enjoyable. My favorite was Amal from Guest Relations- who went out of her way, each and every day she worked during our stay,  to ensure our stay was perfect and that all of our needs were met. She was so very welcoming and warm and helpful. Amal helped to make our trip extra special.  I also so enjoyed Guiseppe (who works in the Winter Garden Restaurant)- he was so friendly and enjoyable and made our dining experience fun.",5,2017,08,04
29,"Impressive, and not only the facilities, mostly the staff!","I will not add to the previous reviews mentioning the facilities and the beauty of the architecture, I would rather add to them the outstanding attitude of the staff there. From the front desk (Mariano) to customer service (Suzanne), the Operations manager (Jaume) and all the room service and concierge staff members. It makes you feel that you know all these people for so long even though on a short stay! We were upgraded to a suite on arrival and hence, got the full treat. It will become our next destination every time we visit the city.",5,2017,08,02
29,Spectacular !!! ,"       We just came back from Barcelona where we stayed at El Palace Hotel . I just want to say that it was one of the best hotels I ever stayed. Everything was amazing. The hotel itself is gorgeous with a prime location. Our room was beautiful and always clean. The housekeeping was doing a great job every day. The stuff at the front desk and the guys at the door were just amazing. Always friendly and always helpful. The guy who spoke Russian was the one that we talked the most ( I regret so much that I forgot his name). He was always caring and attentive and always went beyond his way to help us. 
       I would like to point out a special lady by name Julie who made our stay unforgettable . My husband was in touch with her before our arrival. Since it was our 5 year anniversary we were given an upgrade to a better room and received a bottle of champaign with chocolates including a hand written note from her. She took time to meet us in person later during our stay and it was a real pleasure. 
       There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about El Palace . If I am back to Barcelona, I would only stay there. ",5,2017,07,31
29,"Great hotel, perfect location, highly recommended!","We stayed in a junior suite for 5 nights and it was exceptional!  Everything about this hotel was great.  Room was well appointed and spacious, bed very comfortable, breakfast excellent.  The location was perfect and within walking distance of almost all the sights and many restaurants.  In addition all of the staff were absolutely top notch, especially Juan!  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,31
29,Delicious Afternoon Tea & Great Service ,"We went to this hotel only for the Afternoon Tea and we're glad we did! The service, prior to our arrival and during, was excellent. I'm allergic to gluten and I got in contact with them a couple of weeks before our trip. Margot Campà was utterly professional and made sure I had a gluten-free menu that was absolutely delicious! I also mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and they brought out a birthday pastry that was gluten-free so I could try it. 10/10 for attention to details and outstanding service! 

The sandwiches were really good and the pastries to die for. They also have a very good tea selection.

The whole team made sure we had a superb time there and we thank you for it. 

The only reason I did not rate it a 5 star is because the atmosphere was so-so. We were the only ones there and there was no music playing. You should definitely advertise this experience a lot more as I'm absolutely positive it would be a smashing success! ",4,2017,07,31
29,Very good location with traditional style room,"I stayed here with my family. Since there were 2 children, I asked for connecting rooms. The hotel provided the rooms exactly as I requested.

The location was also very good. All major attractions were within 30 min walking distance.

The conceirge provided me plenty of information to go around. My children also loved the way it looked.

In general, my family would come back to this hotel next time.",5,2017,07,30
29,Great Hotel,"We stayed four nights at El Palace Hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much. The staff were extremely friendly and showed us our way around the town. It's also located in a good position away from the super busy tourist areas yet close enough to walk. The hotel was also really clean and room service was done few times a day. Most of all the lobby area is gorgeous, we would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,07,27
29,Short but very memorable stay,"After careful research I chose El Palace for our 3 night stay in Barcelona before boarding a cruise ship.  I was not disappointed, gorgeous hotel, fabulous breakfast buffet, wonderful rooftop views, room was comfortable elegance. We even went to the cigar bar in the basement where my partner enjoyed a special cigar.  The staff and atmosphere makes you feel aristocratic. Also, I have never stayed at a hotel that has had such a lovely smell throughout -  was it the fresh flowers!?  The location great with walkable streets, tapas bars.  I could have stayed a month or more.",5,2017,07,26
29,Wonderful hotel!,"From the moment we arrived, we experienced top notch service by the hotel staff. The concierge staff provided us with a map and took the time to explain how to get to many places of interest. Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The bed was comfortable and we loved the tv in the mirror! We ordered room service which was delivered quickly and was delicious. Throughout our stay, we felt pampered in every way. Great hotel. I would love to stay there again!",5,2017,07,25
29,Best four days of our trip Barcelona ,"This would have to be the very best hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying in
From the moment of arrival the bell boys and all the staff couldn't do enough for us. They made us so welcome and attention to detail was excellent 
All staff very friendly and helpful including bars and restaurants 
The rooftop bar and restaurants are not to be missed particularly the views over the city 
In particular we would like to mention Amal and Julia in guest services 
These two women are exceptional and would be highly sought after in any position they choose
Thank you El Palace
Warm regards
Denise and Paul Booth

29,"The hotel is Great, the service is NOT!","So we arrived afternoon and I went to check in, the guy in the front desk was very rude, no welcoming nothing at all! and he was very slow. I had a membership with the hotel and one of the thing the card can do is to give you an upgrade so i asked him if its possible for an upgrade and he immediately told me no! i told him can you check for tomorrow and he completely ignored me ( we were staying for 5 nights!).
so after the check in someone should take you to show you the hotel facilities ( no one did until i discover that by accident 2 days later, which was a waste of 2 days that i did not know about the hotel facilities and activities.)
The room was King bed ( I asked for twin since we are two ) and i had to argue and to go under investigation about if you are two why do you need extra bed they agree to give an extra bed.
The bad thing was we took a taxi from the hotel and the taxi robbed us! when i called the hotel to ask them about the camera tape if it recorded the plate number or so, they ignored me totally and refused to cooprate with me.

The Good thing was
the hotel in general is well decorated! it is a Palace!
the room and bathroom was very clean and nice.
the rooftop and the live music was excellent, and above that the location.",3,2017,07,23
29,Wow,"Just an amazing hotel all the way around.  Very elegant, terrific service, terrific rooms, really loved everything about it.  The rooftop pool is small but a very beautiful and quiet space to relax in the afternoon.  The breakfast was fabulous.  Can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Would love to stay here again.",5,2017,07,16
29,Beautiful Property and Service!,Our first stop in Spain began at this hotel.  It was a fantastic way to start our trip.  The hotel is gorgeous and the staff lovely.  It was one of our favorite hotel stays in Europe which is saying a lot--we have stayed in quite a few properties.  It is very classy and a great location.,5,2017,07,15
29,Wow!!,Have just spent 2 nights at this hotel. Absolutely stunning. The decor is sumptuous and elegant. The staff are wonderful. The beds are like sleeping on clouds. Beautiful huge bathroom. It really does feel like you're staying in a palace. Divine!,5,2017,07,15
29,Sunny Barcelona,"Charming classic hotel with elegant old world interiors and large spacious suites. Rooftop pool and terrace where drinks and food can also be ordered.  Enormous bathrooms with high spec modern walk in shower and large jetted tub.
We had a junior suite for 4 nights stay and found it invaluable having a sofa to collapse onto after hours of walking the gothic quarter.
An excellent breakfast buffet laid out in a charming room which appeared to be a garden room, plenty of choices and excellent attentive service.
I found my cappuccino a tad too strong so they were very happy to make another one and next morning I found they had remembered how I liked it done.
If you like older style stately hotels but with excellent service and larger rooms then this one is an excellent choice, not too far to walk to everything.
Also a most helpful doorman who was always on hand to advise the best route to take to get somewhere. Very useful as there was a taxi strike on whilst we were there so this made walking the main mode of transport.
As it was quite hot also I should state that the a/c was excellent as we like a cold room for sleeping. Did not let us down!
Every staff member in this hotel was utterly professional right down to the nightly turndown staff.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,11
29,Outstanding,"This gracious old property is absolutely top notch.  It is not an edgy, new world place--it is of the class of a Ritz property (which it was until 1993) and has been extremely well maintained.  The rooms, especially for Europe, are generously sized.  But, what really sets the place apart is the staff.  They are excellent.  The concierge desk in particular is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,07,11
29,"A beautiful older, traditional hotel","We stayed 4 nights during a business trip to Barcelona.  The property is beautiful, and we especially liked the room in which the breakfast buffet was served.  A Russian guest for lunch said the lobby looked like the royal palace in Saint Petersburg.",5,2017,07,10
29,"Excellent service, very classy and excellent location.","Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Best location. 
Our family of four had a memorable time in Barcelona and can not wait to go back and stay at El Palace.
We also enjoyed the late evening live music at the cocktail bar.
",5,2017,07,09
29,Excellent -- Could not be better!,"We stayed here for two nights, a week apart, and booked two connecting rooms given travel with 3 kids. The hotel and its staff were fantastic and accommodating to our children and large amount of luggage, car seat, stroller, etc. 

It is a beautiful and historic hotel but regularly updated at the highest quality.  We used the rooftop pool one afternoon and took the family to the ""19"" Restaurant on the ground floor.  They were particularly good with the children, which is something you don't always find in places like this.  A great jazz bar downstairs and overall ambience made for 2 great nights.  Xavier assisted us on both nights with all our luggage and check in, and was very nice.  We had an issue with room service one evening which was promptly addressed to our satisfaction. I would return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone for family or business travel.",5,2017,07,09
29,Impressive,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic...or almost everything. Rooms are very nice and spacious, breakfast is the best I have had in any hotel and the rooftop offers a unique and relaxing experience. Only concern is the gym which only offers cardio machines. ",5,2017,07,08
29,Honeymoon,"Spain was our 3rd stop on our 3 country trip. We fell in love with this hotel. The front desk staff were wonderful and the concierge desk staff were excellent!!!! The building is fabulous and so elegant! House keeping was really good. The thing we thought was unusual, was that the pool closed at 6pm. We love to sit out at the pool in the evening....other than that this hotel is perfect!",5,2017,07,07
29,"The ""D"" experience. Traditional, elegance and modernity all together with a staff that don't mesure anything to help you","I stayed in room 407 upgraded which was one that was renewed last january. Gorgeous. Roman bath, blue tooth and all the facilities to make your stay a real dream.  In the breakfast you will find many options to fullfil any desire and waiters are looking after you every time. Fantastic. ",5,2017,07,07
29,Excellent !,"We reach after a long flight  and are told that we do not have a reservation. Well, as it turned out, this was the only glitch in an otherwise wonderful stay. We were made to wait in the opulent lobby tll they finally figured out that the reservation was somehow in the name of my son. Not only did they apologize but upgraded us to a junior suite. 
The suite was extremely comfortable. The mattress and pillows were just what we needed and the bathroom was excellent as well with a Jacuzzi and L'Occitane toiletries. 
One of best features of this hotel is its location. It is within easy walking distance of barri gotic and placa catalunya, which is the starting point for most tours from Barcelona. If the location is good, the concierge is even better. All their restaurant recommendations were spot on and they were extremely helpful every which way, even while taking and giving your quaint room keys.
We do not speak Spanish but did not have any problems as everybody we interacted with seemed comfortable with English.
The breakfast was one of the best you would find in an European hotel. We stayed four nights and although the breakfast menu did not change but the quality was so good that there was no need to. From the jamon to the gazpacho, the sandwiches, omelettes to order, everything was outstanding. 
We just had one meal at their rooftop restaurant and that was great as well. 
All in all, we had a memorable stay in a truly fantastic hotel.",5,2017,07,06
29,Treated like royalty,Stayed here for a week in May 2017. Perfect accommodations! We stayed in a junior suite with the roman bath and it was pure luxury. Cannot find a thing to say negative about the room - perfect right down to the luxurious soft white carpeting. Lovely! The hotel itself is gorgeous. The rooftop pool and bar is wonderful with the sweeping view of the city. There is a jazz bar downstairs which was really fun. All in all you could spend a week just in the hotel but then step out the door and you are in the heart of the city. You can walk to most everything and if you should need a cab the doormen are fantastic! Michael at the concierge desk was most helpful - he selected dinner spots for us and completely outdid himself each night. We ate very well in Barcelona thanks to Michael. Highly recommend this hotel!!,5,2017,07,04
29,When works are in progress honesty commands to close the hotel !,The Palace is not honest with its customers. The rates are the same than as usual. This morning I am disturbed by the noise of the works and I cannot sleep. This afternoon I try to rest and it is the same ! That is not a Palace ! They joke with the customers ! So sad ! I understand why the hotel is empty when all other hotels in Barcelona are full .,1,2017,07,04
29,Opulent Setting and Great Location,"One of the best things about this hotel is its location.  Easy walking distance to all the important sites in the city.  The lobby area is quite opulent, almost overwhelming.  The reception and concierge staff try very hard to meet needs, but sometimes language gets in the way.  The concierge for me did an adequate job of arranging my Spain and Andorra travel.  I asked for several special items, such as flowers, just still water, fruit daily, and I got all those items.

My suite was oddly shaped and it had no view.  I looked straight out into the other wings rooms.  I was very disappointed, and no one offered to move me even though I spoke up about it.  My last night at the hotel, fireworks were shot off the roof and the noise and light were astounding.  The hotel should have communicated this event to all of us, because it scared the daylights out of me, especially considering security today.  

The bathroom amenities are good and typical (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, soap), hair dryer, good towels and bath mats, scale, shower cap, vanity kit, robe and slippers.  Tea and coffee pot, desk with adequate lighting, good size closet and good shelf space, safe, mini bar, and half bath in my suite.  The TVs were easy to use and there were many channels.  The Wi-Fi is good.

I used room service extensively, and it was fine.  The swimming pool and bar area on the roof were ok.  The pool is small and there are only 4 lounge chairs which are in the sun throughout the day.  If you get to the pool after 10am, you probably won't get a chair in the sun, even though there are probably 10 other lounge chairs available.  The view is terrific.  The service at the pool is iffy.  The spa was fine.

This hotel tries very hard, and it is a fantastic home base for seeing the city, but make certain the staff has understood your request, and if you do, you will feel quite comfortable here.",4,2017,07,01
29,Perfect birthday getaway,"Wife and I went for birthday treat. From moment we arrived staff couldn't do enough for us. Bags taken, tour of hotel, welcome drinks, cake, wine, all superb. The rooftop bar and pool area was very relaxing. The large restaurant and bar area beyond reception was superb as was the afternoon tea. The bluesman bar was intimate and the love music brilliant. We'll be back. ",5,2017,07,01
29,A Grand Hotel that lives up to its name!,Lovely property in central Barcelona.  Outstanding service.  We were upgraded without asking to a very quiet and spacious junior suite.  Beautiful buffet breakfast that caters to many international tastes.  Slept for nearly 10 hours after flying in from CA.  Quietest Romo's face tear of hotel.  Great bedding and bath products.  Enormous shower with dual shower wands and dual rain shower overhead.  Party in the shower!,5,2017,06,28
29,Great home base,"We loved it - why?
- large well appointed room-  quiet inward facing off street
- outrageously comfortable bed
- very diligent staff
- excellent breakfast 
- perfect location in center of everything 
Cons
- bars are very quiet, despite having very nice live music and it being high season there aren't many people in common areas",5,2017,06,27
29,Great hospitality!!,"We stayed 4 nights and checked out on 26-Jun. The hotel has palace interiors, very clean, housekeeping does the room makeup as and when you want. The concierge is very information and helpful for example they got of tickets for the best Flamence show in town the same day which otherwise is usually fully book . 
The black rice with seafood in their menu is a must try. The pool is small but more of a relaxation. The hotel was very considerate for our 2 children and upgraded our room too for a comfortable stay. They have 2 bookings in my name and had reserved 2 rooms, it was duplicate booking and we were worried of the cancellation fee but they understood our problem and waived it.
Area of improvement - we were little bored with having the same breakfast every day for 4 days , even the dishes were the same and kept at the same place . I am sure that the chef can do better for a 5 star hotel as per my travel experience. They could also get us baby sitting for about 20EUR /hour in case we wanted but we were not sure if our kids would really adjust. The parking is public right next building and is something like either 3.2EUR/hour or 30/day flat rate and the concierge can park it for you and get your car when you want.",5,2017,06,27
29,Old is Gold,"Old hotel for more than 100 years with very good service and helpful 
Location is good not far from the attractions. 
Rooms size is average with new decorations. 
Breakfast area is relatively small to the hotel size.",4,2017,06,26
29,Spain Touring,"This is a very nice hotel, located in an around the center of the city.  This makes getting to places of interest easy, and enhances walking around because you are near lots of stuff.  The place has lots of old and beautiful styling and the staff could not have been more pleasant.  The rooms and building in my opinion in top notch condition and a pleasure to stay.  I would stay at this hotel again......",5,2017,06,26
29,Very Good Hotel,"Stayed at the El Palace Hotel, the former Ritz, with my wife and teen-age daughters.  We had two connecting rooms, which was appreciated and not very common in the other hotels we stayed at during our trip in Spain. The rooms were large, updated, well appointed and hade nice, large bathrooms, with plenty of storage space.  The hotel lobby is elegant and had some nice sitting rooms.  The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful - they gave the hotel a boutique feel, even though it is a large property.  The doorman / bell hop was quite welcoming and the concierge desk (and all the attendants) was very helpful in arranging dinners and tickets to attractions.  Only complaint was the smell of cigarette smoke in the hallway in the afternoons.  Not sure if people were smoking in the stairwell next to our room or simply emanating from their rooms, but it was bothersome and we had to complain two straight days. The hotel is in a nice location, on Gran Via, and a 10 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya, but if I were to return to Barcelona, and now knowing of Barcelona, I would stay on Passeig de Gràcia, near Gran Via, which is about 3 blocks away.  That was the street with the high-end shops and nice restaurants.",4,2017,06,25
29,Perfect service,"We were greeted and warmly welcomed when we arrived.  Before we were shown to our room we had a brief tour of the property including the rooftop bar/restaurant and pool. Beautiful!! Our room was a suite with every amenity you could possibly need. Room service was prompt, delivering drinks within 15 minutes. When we return to Barcelona this is going the be the only place we consider staying. ",5,2017,06,21
29,You will not be disappointed!,"Everything was perfect at this hotel - the stafff, the room and the location. From the time we arrived at the hotel we knew we had chosen well. It was very hot in Barcelona but the hotel was cool and welcoming. It was also conveniently located so we could pop in for a quick respite from the heat. The staff always recognized us and treated us as if it was our own palace. We will only stay here if we return to Barcelona. ",5,2017,06,19
29,"Elegant, Warm and Welcoming.....","We stepped from the taxi- and were immediately welcomed to the El Palace by lovely Julie- in flawless English! After this gracious and hospitable start, we opened the door to our room on 6, went to the balcony, and over the cheerful red geraniums, looked to the distant  spires  of the Sagrada Familia....Beautiful view!
This elegant hotel opened in 1919 as the Ritz.
Our room was as interesting as one would expect. A short hall led from the main door to the bedroom. The framed mirror above the fireplace mantel was the cleverly disguised tv. Furnishings included two large wing chairs, desk, king bed with pillow menu and an electric teakettle. The spacious bathroom, decorated in a stylish but subdued cocoa brown tile, featured closets and shelves, safe, large tub, large shower, double sinks and toilet room. A/C a plus for the summer in Spain! We enjoyed  our robes and slippers, and a nice selection of Chopard toiletries.
Even though our room was directly over a busy street, it was very well soundproofed.
The location in the upscale Eixample area is safe and convenient;  only 25 minutes to walk home from Sagrada, and 10 minutes or less to Palau de la Musica. We also found Cortes Ingles nearby, as well as great (window) shopping streets!  Cruise port is a short taxi hop. 
The staff was impeccably trained, gracious, and English-speaking.
Restaurants in the hotel were very nice. We enjoyed breakfasts in the Winter Garden Room and tapas and entertainment on the rooftop. My favorite spot was the grand lobby. You must visit to see why!",5,2017,06,15
29,Classy hotel at perfect location,"We completed our trip to North Eastern Spain with a four day stay in Barcelona. We chose El Palace after considerable research on centrally located hotels in the city. We had a very large room on the fourth floor looking out to the back of the hotel, i.e., a very quiet room. Our room had a very large bathroom with a super shower cabin and a separate toilet. Everything in the hotel was high quality. We bought from a ticket machine in a subway station 10-ticket transit book and used it on buses and subways. El Palace is right at intersection of some of the main bus and subway lines. There is a lovely terrace with a small lap pool on the top floor where you can have drinks, eat snack or even dinner. The views are quite nice, including that of the Sagrada Familia.",5,2017,06,12
29,Impromptu visit to rooftop bar,"During a weekend away with 3 girlfriends for my 50th Birthday we likes the look of the Palace hotel. We visited the roof top bar for a look around and cocktails. The waiter was very nice and accommodating and let us look around and do up to the roof terrace where we saw spectacular views of Barcelona. We were then seated at a lovely table by the bar. There was a great musical trio singing Jazz. The ambience was relaxed and the bar manager came and took our order's. I don't really drink and wanted to try a Martini, she explained the difference in the Martini's and I was able to make an informed decision. I chose a Martini Rosso. Our drinks came in a tumbler glass which disappointed me but my friend asked if I could have a Martini glass which they obliged immediately. My friends weren't given one. The service was slow because the bar was busy but that wasn't a problem as we were enjoying the ambience and music. We were surprised bat how reasonable the bill was at approximately 31€. It is a beautiful hotel and setting with fabulous views and first class service. Definitely recommend for an informal evening.b",5,2017,06,11
29,Great location ,"This hotel has so much to offer and is brilliantly located for all of the hot spots in Barcelona. Very friendly staff and willing to serve but they do not get the detail right. Room was only made up at 2,30 in the afternoon and only after I raised it with the front desk. Roof top bar is a fantastic vibey spot but should you seat customers at table that has a water puddle next to it! Bar service was also not great. ",3,2017,06,11
29,Terrific Stay,A beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive. Our room was very large and appointed terrifically and the bathroom was huge and gorgeous. Extremely elegant property and food/drinks were all wonderful.,5,2017,06,09
29,Treated Like Royalty,"Every once in a while, when the travel budget allows it, we treat ourselves to a few nights at a really grand hotel.  The El Palace Hotel was our treat for this vacation, and we weren't disappointed.  The entire check-in experience went smoothly, but we were almost overwhelmed by the number of helpful staff.  At one point, while standing at the reception desk, my husband dropped his hat.  He didn't even notice it, but two of the wonderful valet/concierge staff did and came running (and I mean running) to pick it up and return it to him.  We don't know why (and we didn't ask) but we were upgraded to a better room than we had booked.  It was beautiful; large, clean, comfortable and the bathroom was spectacular.  Unfortunately, it rained for most of our visit in Barcelona, but we still checked out the rooftop terrace and it looked amazing.  On one of those rainy days, when we had gotten soaked wandering around town, we just didn't feel like going out again for dinner.  We decided to have a light meal in the bar.  This was actually one of our favorite experiences.  I'm so sorry I didn't get the name of the wonderful bartender/waiter who served us, but he fussed over us as though we were royalty.  We're pretty casual, ""jeans and T-shirts"" kind of travelers but, for that one night, we definitely felt like members of the hoi-polloi.  Thank you, El Palace, for a really lovely experience.",5,2017,06,08
29,Fantastic,"Lovely hotel in great location close to all barcelona has to offer . Everything was amazing. Food is lovely  staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are Lovely, clean and spacious. Would definitely return to this hotel ",4,2017,06,08
29,Wonderful Elegant Hotel,"El Palace is an First Class Elegant place to stay in Barcelona.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  Rooftop pool, bar and restaurant are all very nice.  Rooms are very clean and large.  Location is great as it is walking distance to many sightseeing locations.  Overall a great place to stay in Barcelona",5,2017,06,07
29,Old Time Luxury and Comfort,"This hotel offers a very luxurious and comfortable stay. The buffet breakfast cuisine was great and the setting in the garden lovely. We were upgraded to a suite which had plenty of room, an incredible modern bathroom and a powder room. The view was disappointing as all of their suites face an interior building courtyard. The dinner at their Winter Garden restaurant was good. The location of the hotel is good but not quite as good as The Majestic which is further up Playa de Gracia. In sum, if you want the ultimate in luxury and comfort, this would be a good choice for you. ",4,2017,06,06
29,Wonderful Barcelona gem,"We loved this hotel!  Stayed here 4 nights on our first trip to Spain.  Comfortable rooms, gorgeous public areas, and excellent service.  Great location to get to all sights - we walked almost everywhere.  The concierge staff was so helpful with great recommendations - Alexis especially!  Beautiful breakfast room and bounteous buffet. Also highly recommend drinks before or after dinner on the rooftop terrace. I highly recommend this hotel - loved every minute of our stay.",5,2017,06,04
29,OUTSTANDING HOTEL IN TERMS OF ROOMS AND SERVICE,"We only got to spend one night at El Palace - the original Ritz Hotel - in Spain.  Last visit we were at the Mandarin Oriental, which I rated as tops in terms of location and service.  But I have to say, El Palace tops the Mandarin in my view.  We had a fabulous classic city view room. It was huge!  It was beautifully decorated. Large bathroom and large closet space.  What could be more perfect?   Better lighting.  It was a little dark.  My taste.  I'd have more light, especially in the bathroom.

Our room was 449.99 euros

We had dinner in the Winder Garden on the Terrace with magnificent views.  We had a great meal.  Our meal with drinks was 69 euros.

If we go back to Barcelona, and we will, we will definitely stay at El Palace.",5,2017,06,04
29,A step back in time; great location,"This is the old Barcelona Ritz hotel. Its opulent, has retained many original features but has been tastefully upgraded. Breakfast in the Winter Garden was really nice. Also enjoyed the cocktail bar...the mixer was pure quality. Only down side (for us) was that there was a Cuban bank playing 100% Spanish language songs ...more variety would have be appropriate in a 5* hotel in a major European city. Location is excellent for city centre, Rambalas etc. If you want the beach, better choose the W Hotel.   ",4,2017,06,04
29,Elegant Hotel in a great area of Barcelona,"The Palace Hotel was our favorite hotel during our 2 week trip to Spain.  The location was central, the hotel's interior was beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,02
29,A very very nice hotel.,"This hotel is very nice, could not fault anything from when we arrived till the morning we left. 
We have never slept in a bed of that quality before, sheer luxury.
The roof top for a few drinks in the evening is a must , look for the extra staircase to the top level for seating with views. Lovely.",5,2017,06,02
29,Fabulous Stay,"It was our first trip to Barcelona and we chose this hotel due to its great reviews on TA. We were not disappointed. Great location, fabulous staff and overall a great 5 days here to explore the wonderful city. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend El Palace and defiantly would stay again, first class.",5,2017,05,28
29,Great hotel for a city break,"Just returned from a trip to Barcelona, spending 3 nights at the El Palace Hotel, which I can thoroughly recommend. The staff were superb - very relaxed and welcoming whilst maintaining excellent service. The public areas of the hotel were splendid and the room we had was lovely with a large, modern and well equipped bathroom. There's also a really nice roof terrace that gives great views over the city and to the sea. Location wise it was perfect for us - in the Eixample but near to the medieval quarter and the Casa Batllo and a 1km(ish) walk to the Sagrada Familia. It may not be to everyone's taste, as it's the opposite of all the clinical white and chrome trendy hotels that command the same star rating, but all the better for it in my book!",5,2017,05,27
29,Gorgeous hotel in lovely Barcelona,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel in the heart of Barcelona - a feeling of ""home away from home"" in luxurious surroundings. This is ""old style"" ambience with all the modern amenities one could wish for - a lovely entrance / lobby area, absolutely chic restaurant on ground floor level at the end of an amazing, enormous, living room area. Visited the bar beneath ground floor - chic and cool; also visited the rooftop pool area which offers a lovely view of the city. Excellent room, super comfortable bed and large, modern bathroom. A lovely experience in this super hotel - would very gladly return the next time around.",5,2017,05,25
29,Excellent service.,There's no words to discribe the amazing stay in this stunning luxury hotel. I just love it. I'll come back for sure. The staff was gentle and attentive at all time. I suggest everything who want to spend an excellent holidays in Barcelona.,5,2017,05,24
29,First class Stay,"This is a top quality hotel that delivers. I took my wife for a weekend break to celebrate her Birthday and we left having had a fantastic experience. From the moment we arrived at the Impressive entrance of El Palace we were greeted by a superbly turned out door man. Throughout our stay he was always ready to get us a taxi or help us with our bags. Always smiling. The check in was slick and we were shown around the hotel and up to our room by a young lady who explained everything we would need to know for our stay. This hotel offers a five star experience that is sadly lacking in many hotels of the same calibar these days. We have stayed at the Gritti Palace and this is on par. The surroundings are regal and the rooms clean and comfortable. In the basement a great bar that regularly hosts live music and on the roof top terrace a pool, restaurant and bar to relax in. We did not eat in the restaurants but can thoroughly recommend breakfast. As I mentioned we were celebrating my wife's birthday and although we did not advertise this we were surprised to find a bottle of champagne left in our room with the hotels compliments. Thank you Mr Jaume Donjo (operations Manager) it was a wonderful gesture. All in all I can highly recommend this hotel and it's excellent staff to anyone who wishes to sample the finer things in life. Barcelona is an excellent city to visit and there can be no better hotel to stay in than the El Palace.",5,2017,05,21
29,Perfect!  Best hotel experience!,"We loved our stay at El Palace.  The hotel is indeed a palace - everything spotless, the staff perfect,  the rooms and surroundings luxurious.  Great breakfast, wonderful rooftop bar.  So many touches, small and big, to make for a memorable stay.  This was a crowning cap to our four week European trip.  Made Barcelona special for us.",5,2017,05,20
29,Class in Barcelona ,"This hotel deserves a review, but I suspect it's clientele are not the usual TA readers. 1) It is the old Ritz, and lives up to the name. All class. The approach reveals an incredible facade of old world charm. The doormen friendly and helpful. 
Reception and concierge area are quaint but effective. After this, one enters a second smaller lobby where the 2 independent elevators are. Then your jaw drops at a huge extravagant old world lounge, then bar cum restaurant, then a smaller walk through lounge to end up in a huge gorgeous breakfast area with retractable roof. 
2) Rooms are large. Bed is the most comfortable we've slept in. Large ensuite with bath and separate shower. TV inside a mirror. Daily water and paper supplied. Great vista out to the Gran Via Catalunya. 
3) The gym is a token gym - not for serious workouts. 
4) Rooftop pool, bar, and Restaurant are nice, with excellent views of Barcelona from 7 stories up. 
5) Well positioned for walks to Gothic/La Rambla/El Borne/ and even the beaches if energetic. 
6) Spa area is nice, the massages very relaxing, but very pricey, even for a 5 star hotel. 
7) Breakfast food is very good. Large selection from the buffet and omelettes made to order. 
8) Across the road is the Alsur Cafe, one of the few makers of a decent cappuccino in Barcelona, good selection of bakery items, and a really good hamburger. Their house red wine is really really good. 
9) Close (2 blocks) to 2 different metro stations, including Passeig de Gracia which serves 3 lines.  

A very pleasant place to stay at in Barcelona if you wish to indulge yourself in an upmarket hotel. ",4,2017,05,18
29,Mixed Review,"Beautiful hotel with very good service in a convenient location.  For the price, the air conditioner should work/not be on a governor -- it was very hot.  Also, if you are looking for a non-smoking room, look elsewhere.  We had a non-smoking room but sill smelled smoke.",3,2017,05,18
29,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel has one of the nicest lobby's I have ever seen. The service there was sensational. Buffet breakfast was terrific and the rooms were just great. What can I say, just a perfect place to stay at. Great hotel",5,2017,05,17
29,Wonderful and elegant hotel,"We stayed at El Palace Hotel in Barcelona for 4 days before getting on our cruise ship in Barcelona.
It was perfect in every way. It was very old world elegant, with a lovely nice sized room and gorgeous public areas.
The service was amazing , very friendly and accommodating.
Location was great, a very short walk to Passage de Gracia, a beautiful shopping area, where wonderful shops and restaurants abound. The hotel is in the beautiful Eixample area of the city.
We booked with the bed and breakfast rate and the sumptuous breakfast served in the gorgeous breakfast room was worth the extra money.
The hotel was 5 star all the way, but so was the price.
But it was worth the price!
",5,2017,05,16
29,Best hotel experience ,"We cannot say enough good things about this hotel!  The El Palace is a beautiful old world hotel in a great location for walking to many of the highlights in Barcelona.  Our room was large, attractively decorated, wonderful bed & modern large bathroom.  The staff was outstanding at every level.  The gentlemen at the concierge desk went above and beyond in getting us tickets to a sold out concert, recommending nearby restaurants which were excellent and they, with the doorman, were so helpful in assuring we knew how to get to our destination as we walked out the door each morning.  The everyday restaurant served very good, beautifully plated food for dinner.  The Palace is an expensive hotel but we certainly feel it is worth it.",5,2017,05,16
29,Perfection in Barcelona Hotels!,We were treated like old friends from the moment we arrived until we drove away in our taxi. This is a beautiful hotel and its location is perfect.  Our room was very large and the bathroom was fabulous. The bed was comfortable and there was lots of storage. The Breakfast room was very nice and offered a fabulous selection of foods.  We had some delicious casual meals at the Alsur Cafe across the street.  The prices are good and the food is great.  It was also a good place to engage in conversation with others.  El Palace is beautiful inside and out.  We look forward to staying there every time we are in Barcelona from now on.,5,2017,05,13
29,Excellent hotel,We were fortunate to stay at the hotel for four days the first of May.   I am particular on a number of things when it comes to hotels and this one was high on most of my criteria.  The staff was helpful and wanted to do a good job.  The location is wonderful and room was excellent(newly decorated).  Room service was excellent.  The roof top restaurant was very nice and corrected a bad dish without question.  Wait staff was top notch.  Customer service was excellent from all employees.  Will look forward to staying again.,5,2017,05,11
29,5star opulence,"5 star old world opulence at its finest. The sitting room lush with velvets and lamps, the concierge and staff at reception warm and friendly. Our rooms were huge we stayed on the 3rd floor no balcony or view but we didn't mind. Walk in wardrobe and huge bathroom with spa bath. Within walking distance to eixample designer shops department stores ect. 5min walk to La Rambles and the harbour. The bugger BFAST was exceptional 29€ pp a little pricey but everything g you could wish for. The roof top terrace was Devine with small pool bar and restaurant. Could not fault. ",5,2017,05,10
29,Very well named - A palatial experience,"We had two nights in the hotel and wish it could have been much longer. It is an outstanding place where you are attentively looked after - even before stepping through the door!. After a speedy check-in you are whisked to your room by a customer hostess. The ground floor area is opulently decorated and nothing could be described as under-stated.

The rooms are superb - modern but spacious with a comfortable bed and plenty of amenities. The bathroom is huge with a first class shower and other facilities and stocked with quality spa products. A couple of blissfully quiet nights sleep allow you to refresh yourself and it proved to be a great base for our all-too-short Barcelona excursion and is well placed in the city.",5,2017,05,03
29,Fabulous ,"This is one of the best hotels in Barcelona and probably also one of the best in Spain. We spent the first three of six days here at the beginning of our land tour across northern Spain. El Palace is located in the heart of the city with easy access to the art and architectural delights of historical Barcelona. The hotel is Wi-Fi equipped. Parking is problematic in this city of about two million; however, the concierge can help in this regard. They will also be very helpful with often necessary dinner and museum reservations.",5,2017,05,02
29,Palace it is.,"Palace it is!  I suspect only competitor is Mandarin Oriental which I have not tried yet.The other leading hotel of the world near by is not bad either 😉So close to excellent Tapas bar,so cheap too. Shopping is easy and close by. Walk 2 street to main st Garcia",5,2017,04,30
29,A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN BARCELONA ,"I have been so many times and stay in all 5 stars in this city ... EL PALACE deserves a special attention in term of exceptional location , high level staff, unique terrasse and roof top pool and the most amazing well decorated SUITES !!!!
If you are looking for the best SUITES in this city , no doubt book Josephine Baker or Ronnie Wood suites , this will be your best ever traveling memory ! 
I love luxury experiences , this one with my family 3 nights in Barcelona is just ranked number 1 ..",5,2017,04,22
29,El Palace Hotel,This hotel is very expensive for what you receive. The service in the restaurant and rooftop bar was awful.  Couldn't get waited on.  The gym equipment is very outdated.  The elliptical machine was broken.The rooms are lovely and refurbished.  a couple of blocks away from las rambles so it was refreshing to get away from all the hustle and bustle.  The concierge was helpful however not too many people spoke english and it made it difficult to figure out what to do and where to go.  ,3,2017,04,18
29,Outstanding hotel,"Beautiful bedroom, sitting room and bathroom.  Very helpful concierge willing to give directions, get tickets and answer any questions we might have in our 6 night stay.  The Winter Garden restaurant was excellent, don't miss the gnocchi.",5,2017,04,18
29,"Very nice hotel, professional staff","The hotel is ideally situated to visit the main attractions and to do some shopping.

We stayed 3 nights in a ""Privilege Junior Suite"" with our 10 year old son. The room was very nice and comfortable, ample space for 3. Bedding is very comfortable.

Breakfast is great, lots to choose from.

The Concierge desk was really helpful in advising restaurants and making reservations, very professional. 

The staff is very nice and helpful in general.",4,2017,04,18
29,Never Again,"Room was lovely, clean and well appointed.  Restaurant service was non existent.  Pool was freezing. Roof top bar, again lack of service.  Roof top restaurant.  After waiting to be waited on we finally left and went across the street to get dinner.  ",2,2017,04,17
29,Marvelous 'Time Travel' at the Majestic El Palace Hotel in Barcelona,"Everything about the El Palace Hotel speaks to the historical elegance and sophistication of a century ago as visited by royalty 'back in the day'.  The hotel stands out on the Gran Via with its red geranium planter boxes in each window; upon entry you are met by attentive and welcoming staff, fresh flowers, and the tradition of the hotel that opened in 1919. The guest relations manager, Julia and her staff could not have been more pleasant.

I was in Barcelona for business and the hotel is very central located with taxis easy for the door staff to hail even during the morning rush. My room was on the 5th floor and was immaculate, quiet and very well designed. Although not currently for use, each room had a fireplace reflective on a by-gone era.  My front window let in lots of light was added to the ambience. The king bed was comfortable, I used the small work desk, upholstered furniture was done tastefully, aircon was sufficient, room was fully carpeted, and the closets were ample. The marble floored walk-in bath featured a separate tab and shower and ample counter space with dual sinks.

Please visit the roof bar and restaurant for stunning views of the entire city, as well for a comfortable location to relax. I had a breakfast each morning as part of my room package with whatever tasty egg dishes you wanted made-to-order and served promptly. As others have written, this historic 'Leading Hotels of the World' property is just beautiful and should not be missed when staying in Barcelona.

One suggestion to management for improvement. During my stay, the internet and telephone occasionally cut-out or was otherwise interrupted that presented an inconvenience for business guests. I assume that situation has now been remedied.

Again, thank you for a memorable stay at this property.",5,2017,04,14
29,Perfect,"El Palace hotel was originally a Ritz Hotel - many locals still refer to it as "" Ritz Palace Hotel"" rather than El Palace. An amazing building  about 100 years old but very well maintained with no problems in infrastructure and perfectly decorated interiors - rooms giving the impression that it was renovated only a few months ago. The Hotel is also very well located at the intersection of L'eixample and the ""old town"", only a few steps from Placa de Catalunya, to the south of which, La Rambla, Barri Gotic and many other touristic places worth to visit are located. Also in walking distance to Passeig de open windows, but those provide sufficient isolation when kept close. The hotel has 5 large ""art suites"" with two bedrooms, one of which named after Salvadore Dali, because that was where he actually stayed for some time. Classic Deluxe rooms are also sufficiently roomy and very nicely decorated with classic looking modern new furniture - A classic style mirror over an unused fireplace serves both as a functional mirror and has an embedded TV panel at the same time...Beds are  large and quite comfortable, housekeeping very good, breakfast though not amongst the best you may find in luxury end hotels around the world still offers very good variety and in general are tasty, concierge is very good - all speak perfect english and quite cheerful and heplful, room service quite prompt. Overall a perfect hotel offering for the its price range in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,14
29,Worst Experience Ever,"I made my reservation and requested a king size bed specifically over email more than a month before my arrival yet the staff still tried to convince me that I had to take two twin size beds and the house keeping would put a blanket over to make them a king size bed for me. After I told her that I made my request of a king size bed over a month ago, she first claimed that the hotel did not have a room with a king size bed and then changed to saying that all king size bedrooms were fully booked and all taken. When she saw that I insisted having the room I requested and nothing else, she told me to wait 30 minutes for the room to be ready. However, 30 minutes later she told me it was going to take another 40 minutes.
Long story short, horrifying experience for such a prestigious hotel. For the entire time, no apologies whatsoever. Never ever coming back. ",1,2017,04,14
29,Unique and tasted decoed hotel located in city center,"tasted deco with sense of old golden age. Traditional-style super service. Located in city center, within walinking distance to several metro station. 5 min walk to plaza catalunya, passige de gracia. 10 min to la rambla, Gaudi's house. room is spacious, esp in such a expensive area, big washroom, nice balcony and even a walk-in clockroom",5,2017,04,13
29,Fairytale of a hotel - Magical in it's Elegance and Beauty!,"We spent 3 day at the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona after a cruise and never wanted to leave!  The hotel has gone through great renovations in the last few years that cultimated in a 5 Star Deluxe destination place in downtown Barcelona.  This beautiful elegant hotel was super high-tech in their rooms, what we thought was the mirror over the fireplace was the TV.  So innovative and smart!  When it's time to return again, the Palace will be a ""no-brainer"" for us as we use it for our home base to explore this vibrant city!",5,2017,03,29
29,Excellent Hotel!,We toured Spain with 6 of our children. El Palace hotel was a delight! The staff of happy and kind. The breakfast has a number of worldly options. The dinner was exceptional! We will choose to stay in the El Palace hotel during our next trip to Spain! ,5,2017,03,27
29,Beautiful historic hotel,"Traveled with my wife and 3 kids kids (16, 13 and 11). Very central location with helpful staff.  Rooms were fairly large for basic connecting rooms in Europe.  Hotel has been renovated and looks great.  Spa was very nice - had a fantastic massage.  Spa is not that big.  Breakfast was very nice.  Only complain was the room keys - they were giant with the room # on the key.  They were functional like key cards but tiny with a  giant yarn attachment.  Nobody wants to carry this around as it is too big for a pocket and if you lose it people will know which hotel and room you are in.  Management needs a better key system.",5,2017,03,25
29,"Great hotel, Great service","wonderful stay , we had a beautiful king deluxe room, food beautiful. staff so friendly yet unobtrusive, we will be back, located close to Cataluna  Square with Las Ramblas near as well.  Camp Nou museum a must for Barca lovers also La Sagrada Famalia.",5,2017,03,24
29,Classic comfort,"Spent four nights at this very spacious and comfortable hotel.  The staff and service was excellent,  Had a very comfortable classic room with a walk in wardrobe.  Very good breakfast choice.  Excellent views of whole city from roof top bar and restaurant.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Good location too.",5,2017,03,24
29,"Great hotel, make sure to go for higher floors","Beautiful lobby, location isn't too bad either. We had a room on the first floor, we found that window is frosted - it feels strage to be in a 5* hotel and not be able to look out of the window. Massive, clean and modern bathrooms with bathtubs with massage were a highlight.",4,2017,03,22
29,Great classic hotel,"Vacationing in Spain and Portugal. Classic hotel. Five star accommodations and service. Excellent restaurant ---- 19. Convenient location. Great rooftop views of city. Staff is friendly, professional and competent. ",5,2017,03,20
29,Amazing base in Barccelona,"This hotel accommodates every wish and is in a favorable neighborhood close enough to everything but far enough away from the mayhem that is La Ramblas. The service is impeccable, and the food is delicious, especially the breakfast. It is a beautiful property, so make sure to take time to enjoy the lovely lounges and rooftop bar. I waffled between this hotel and Majestic, but I'm so glad I booked El Palace. The Majestic is a great property, too, but is too far away. You won't regret booking this hotel. ",5,2017,03,13
29,"Amazing Hotel! Top notch staff, service, food, rooms - everything!","We had an amazing 3 nights stay in El Palace to celebrate my fiancés birthday . We're 2 adults and we brougt our 3-year old with us. 
To summarize this hotel in a sentence would be - ""nothing is impossible!"". Best staff I've ever encountered - just pure class and super friendly! Rooms were excellent, restaurants were better than everything I've tried in Barcelona (been here twice), spa treatment were a delight! We're just amazed - and I would give my absolute highest recommendation to El Palace.

Thank you so much for making our Barcelona stay into a wonderful memory for life.
All the best

29,Exceptional old-world luxury in Barcelona,"This is a wonderful classic property with tons of history and character, immaculately and lovingly maintained. In addition to the beautiful and well-appointed building, service is a real standout as well, with every staff member providing exceptional care. 

Food is also a winner here, with some great restaurant and in-room dining options. 

I would not hesitate to return.",5,2017,03,02

We got an upgrade which was an extra bonus! Hotel in a great location, there's a restaurant nearby which was recommended to us (Casa Alfonso) which we absolutely loved. Hotel bar on top floor is very nice, great views of the city.",5,2017,02,23

29,Amazing Birthday trip to Barcelona staying in the Fabulous El Palace Hotel,"The location is perfect, the building is Fabulous, the staff were nothing short of Excellent and very, Very helpful. The room facilities were second to none. The front desk were able to book us into restaurants that we were unable to book into or just didn't have enough grasp of the Spanish language. They even booked our taxi trips around the city when walking was not an option. ",5,2017,02,17
29,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel is truly fantastic - wonderful food and  beautiful surroundings. The staff were absolutely outstanding, nothing was too much trouble and they carried out their tasks with such friendliness.  The bar in the basement that has live music at the weekend was amazing.",5,2017,02,13
29,Can it get better in Barcelona?,"This is not only one of the many «Palace» hotels – it’s a real Grand Hotel which leads you back into old times, included all the luxury you might dream of. Of course, the service, ambience, atmosphere, location, sleeping facilities: Everything is excellent and as you could expect from a 5-star hotel. What came totally unexpected was the incredible breakfast. Not only the food and service, but the fantastic room where it is served, and the atmosphere around it. People who have written some of my reviews might have discovered that the breakfast experience means very much to me. It sets in a way the day on the right or wrong track for me. At this hotel, it certainly was doing it right…",5,2017,02,09
29,Wonderful!,"This is a high-end hotel, so fairly expensive, but a great place. Excellent rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good restaurants. We ate twice in the rooftop restaurant, which we enjoyed a lot. There also is a Michelin-starred restaurant there,but we didn't get there. Location of hotel is also good, just on the north end of the older parts of the city. Recommended!",5,2017,02,04
29,Fantastic to say the least!,"From the moment u step into this hotel till u leave on ur final day, this hotel and every single staff of this hotel makes u feel special. That's exactly what you expect from a 5star hotel.

From the very helpful anna (reservations) to the extremely polite gentleman at the reception, Julie(PR Team), the concierge team and every other staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to make it an absolutely wonderful stay.

The hotel by itself is beautiful and very very close to all the major shopping areas and tourist attractions. Breakfast was wonderful and they catered very well to our dietary restrictions. Rooms were splendid and they upgraded us which was very kind of them. L'occitane toiletries was definately another plus point.

If I want to be over critical then the only point i would bring out is that some areas of the hotel needs a new carpet. But that's a very very minor issue.

Overall a GREAT STAY WITH SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE. Will definately come back and stay at EL PALACE.",5,2017,02,01
29,Luxury and location,Great hotel in a very convenient location. The check in was easy---the room spacious and clean. The Blues bar in the basement hosted live music that was outstanding. the breakfast was excellent. A luxury stay in Barcelona-----thank you Palace Hotel!,5,2017,01,30
29,Top Class,"My wife and I  stayed in El Palace Hotel to celebrate our 20 year anniversary and also my wife's 'special' birthday. We underestimated the 5 star status attached to this hotel and were blown away by the excellent service and attention to small detail which we found in this hotel. The service was the best I have ever seen in any hotel I have stayed in. The Concierge 'team' were extremely helpful with any query we had regarding information on all the sights and went out of their way to make sure everything was right. One of the guys checked out the availability of the Sagradia Familia, booked it for us for the time to suit us, printed off our tickets, put us into a taxi and 15 minutes later we were 
in the Basilica!!! We ate in the hotel once as we wanted to explore Barcelona.....and the food in the roof top restaurant was excellent, not to mentions, the music and  the service! The service in the hotel was so good that we came back to the bar every night where there was brilliant music, and a lovely atmosphere in the bar. To cap it all , I even met Ronnie Wood one of my idols in the hotel who graciously gave me the opportunity to take a selfie with him!! The hotel also has a small but very comfortable gym  which we used and satisfied our needs! All in all this was a weekend which we will never forget.......because of this hotel which we were lucky to select for our 3 night stay! We'll be back!",5,2017,01,28
29,Great Visit!,"You can see Sagrada Familia from your balcony, breakfast at hotel is must!! Rich open buffet. Hotel is up to its name you feel like you are a visitor of a palace thank you see you next time.
We loved it so much!",5,2017,01,27
29,Luxurious Barcelona hotel.,Within easy walking to Barcelona centre. Nothing was too much effort for the staff and they made the stay very enjoyable. Luxurious surroundings and the 360 degree city views from the roof top bar are lovely.,5,2017,01,22
29,Magnificent place to stay!,"This hotel deserves every bit of praise given here on TripAdvisor.  The lobby is one of the most elegant, and at the same time, inviting, places to relax (and journal as I did). The staff are fabulous: they speak good English, and are extremely attentive to the guests.  Management is very meticulous, as I experienced late one morning returning to my room to see a crew of painters touching up the baseboards in the hallway, removing scuff marks.  The small details count.  The room was beautiful, modern, clean, and very comfortable.

Our first night we dined at the lobby bar Nineteen, and had an excellent meal.  We felt my wife's truffle foie cannelloni was the evening's winning dish.  (Not huge portions, mind you, but very flavorful.)  

After dinner we ventured downstairs to their lounge bar adorned in plush red velvet booths and cozy tables.  The master bartender expertly crafted the cocktails, while a jazz trio warmed up with a few numbers like Paul Desmond's 'Take Five', and eventually a sultry singer joined in for a fabulous nightclub scene from a bygone era.  Tip: when ordering a martini in Spain, it is not going to be what you might expect in the U.S.  Your server will ask whether you want 'red or white'.  (When I asked what the locals prefer, she responded enthusiastically, ""white"".)  What you receive is a highball glass of ice cubes with an orange slice at the bottom, and filled with chilled vermouth.  But not the nasty vermouth found on our U.S. store shelves; something very different - and delicious.  (I ordered two.) 

The hotel is within walking distance to many of Barcelona's treasures, including its VERY BEST restaurant: El Quim de Boqueria, in the Boqueria marketplace.  (Don't put it off, you'll want to eat there more than once.)

We will definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.  A special place.",5,2017,01,19
29,Outstanding in very area,"The most amazing hotel we have ever visited. The service is second to none, the rooms clean, comfortable and luxurious. This hotel is a real hidden gen waiting to be discovered. It reminds people of the movie 'Hotel Budapest' and has all the comfort, service and decor of that era. If you ever wanted to stay somewhere where. You are looked after, living in luxury and do not have to think about anything then this is that hotel. Truly an amazing hotel. 
The spa also has on over lots of treatments to make you feel truly you are living the life. 
The breakfast is in a sun area which is well sorted and you can order what's like if you can to find what you want.",5,2017,01,17
29,S s Parker ,"Excellent and very accommodating staff who remember your name. Beautiful accommodations, easy walk to most sites in Barcelona . Holiday events/ dinners beautifully executed. Several languages spoken. Garden Room breakfast  presents a variety of dishes. Eating there for 12 mornings I was able to sample most everything offered. Noticed they accept group tours seamlessly.
Would stay there again.",5,2017,01,12
29,Every single thing was perfect,"From the moment we walked through the hotel reception... no the hotel door till the second we walked out, from the door man to the manager, the concierge all the staff were simply ... beyond perfection, so nice cordial and helpful.
I could go on for days about them, so I think I will stop.
Regarding the hotel itself and its amenities, also excellent location 10/10 clean 10/10 rooms specious (we took two one junior suite and one deluxe room).
It is a definite thumb up. Good no EXCELLENT Job.",5,2017,01,12
29,"Excellent hotel, best in the city","We booked for a birthday treat and we were greeted with complimentary Cava and chocolates, a lovely thought. Everything in the hotel was thoughtful and luxurious. The staff are excellent and super friendly. The downstairs bar does a wonderful G&T and has excellent service. We ordered the enormous breakfast in bed and was not disappointed...it could feed a small family! All in all, a great hotel in a fantastic city! ",5,2017,01,03
29,"The perfect combination of luxury, location, service and value","Based on all of the reviews, I was expecting a great experience but my expectations were exceeded.  Immediately upon check-in the staff demonstrated the level of service that we could expect when I was shown to the room while my husband went to the ATM.  As soon as he returned every staff member in sight greeted him by name and then brought him to the room.  The concierges were extremely helpful with restaurants, directions, spa appointments, and tourist information.  Everyone working in the hotel could not do enough to help us.

One unanticipated bonus is that the hotel is actually much closer to everything than I expected from looking at the map.  But it is far enough away from Las Ramblas, etc that it was peaceful and quiet without being remote.

The public areas of the hotel were the most beautiful I've ever seen, especially decorated for Christmas.  The breakfast was very nice, although a bit expensive, as were the cocktails.  But I was happy to pay a premium for drinks just to sit in the lounge - it was that lovely!

The room was very nice, too, with a huge bathroom, comfortable beds, very clean, and an adorable hidden mini bar.

I will separately review Caelis (terrible) and the Mayan Spa (fantastic) as they are not part of the hotel.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the El Palace, we loved every minute of it!",5,2017,01,03
29,Quality with a personal touch,"Amazing quality from the moment you walk in to this fine hotel. Younare greeted by a quality team at reception and concierge. We must also single out people like Julie from guest relations who is beyond professional.
Thank you for making Barcelona a destination thatbwe want to come back to and certainly in this hotel.",5,2017,01,03
29,Touch of luxury and vintage style for 40th birthday,"I booked El Palace for a long weekend in October hoping for something relaxing and a bit special for my wife's 40th birthday. We were not disappointed. Our room, although not one with the roman style bath I've heard about, was very spacious, stylish, comfortable and luxurious, with sofa, coffee table, walk-in wardrobe and very large bathroom with twin wash bowls and separate jacuzzi jet bath and large ""rain"" shower. Plenty to chill out in luxury in between exploring the city and dining. 

We found the location ideal for exploring too: not right in the busy shopping and touristic gothic quarter, but close enough to access it with a quick walk which we did many times. Being a little further north meant also quicker access to other attractions such as the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. We made surprisingly little use of the buses or metro, enjoying the walking and taking in the variety of beautiful city architecture. 

About the rooftop pool, one of the attractions that led me to choose this hotel: maybe I was a little optimistic about the temperature in October! The weather was lovely but not really warm enough for rooftop swimming, the water being pretty chilly. Nobody else took the plunge when we were there either. We did enjoy lounging by it in the last rays of sunshine though - very peaceful. 

Finally the service we received at the hotel was faultless, courteous, professional and personal. Thank you so much for marking a special occasion El Palace!",5,2017,01,02
29,Old world luxury in a beautiful city,"We stayed at El Palace in Barcelona for five days in September.  This is a truly beautiful old world hotel with gracious service and impeccable surroundings.  Upon arrival, we were delighted to be upgraded to a lovely room with a fireplace and one of the original roman baths with two showers, one new and the other from the 1920s.  Both were marvelous and my husband and I were able to simultaneously shower one morning when we overslept and needed to get out the door quickly.  The hotel is nicely located, between Las Ramblas and Eixample.  We were able to walk almost everywhere, except for Sagrada Familia which is a short cab ride away.  We loved the opportunity to recharge every afternoon at the rooftop bar and pool area.  We had the breakfast buffet every morning, which is located in a lovely enclosed area at the rear of the hotel with black and white marble floors and potted plants.  The selection of breakfast items was ample and the setting very serene.  We especially enjoyed  the singer and jazz combo at the jazz club, which we were able to catch on a Friday night during our stay.  Although this is a luxury hotel experience, we felt that we received very good value for our dollar.  A hotel of this caliber in New York would be at least twice the cost.   ",5,2017,01,02
29,Beautiful hotel,"Great rooms, excellent and attentive service.  Really wanted to give it 5 Stars but upon arrival after New Year's Eve dinner, a member of our party had his watch snatched off his wrist exiting the cab.  I know it can happen anywhere, but we felt the hotel should have had 1-2 security people standing around ensuring their guests get into the hotel safely.",4,2017,01,01
29,Lives up to its name.,"This is a great hotel, that lives up to its name. Is it a bit fussy, yes.  However, it is also extremely comfortable with excellent service. I came here with a large group of friends, and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  For instance, when, at 1 AM, we wanted to have drinks on the very top of the roof, the servers arranged the furniture and brought up trays of drinks to make us happy. That attitude separates a very good hotel, from a fine hotel.  The pictures you have seen are exactly what you will experience at this hotel. A Belle Époque enormous lobby, with Regency style rooms and a spacious bathroom.  I cannot comment on the restaurants, because we ate out every evening in this fabulous city. I have attached pictures of the rooftop pool and garden, because they have been omitted from prior reviews -- as far as I have seen.  My only criticism of this hotel would be the scent they use in the lobby – – which is rather musky, almost a patchouli-like scent; which may be historically appropriate, but personally unappealing.  Do not hesitate to book this hotel. It lives up to its reputation and name. ",5,2017,01,01
29,Lovely and friendly hotel,"Loved this place! Everyone here was super attentive and friendly and the rooms were great. Location is great and close to everything. It was wonderful chatting with David, who was also from the same place we were from, all of it was very pleasant. They were also extremely accommodating of our toddler (2 yrs) and helped with kits, toys, chocolate and a great crib. Can't go wrong with this hotel!",5,2016,12,20
29,Beautiful Hotel,"EL Palace hotel is on Gran Via De Les Corts.  A long road lined with shops & bars, this makes El Palace a great location and very central to lots of attractions, it is about a 15 minute walk from the Barcelona Cathedral.  
It has combined a great mix of old grand with new modern, the lobby & bar areas have a feel of the 1940's but the rooms have been upgraded with modern facilities.  

The bar has a rooftop pool, although we could not gain access as they close it for winter 

The garden room for breakfast is incredibly grand.  

If you are staying in Barcelona a stay at the EL Palace hotel would be a very good idea",4,2016,12,18
29,Ageless Grace,"Beautiful building, very well maintained.  Outstanding, friendly service, very good concierge service and excellent dinner at Club 19.  Comfortable rooms, great shower, great beds! Enjoyed the live bands playing in the basement bar.",5,2016,12,17
29,Super Views from the top,"amazing hotel, with clean swiming pool, in the top you have one of the best views of the city (i think), also i think you can go to take a drink to the top bar and lunch or dinner, is not obligatory to sleep in the hotel to do it",4,2016,12,17
29,Luxurious and comfortable ,"My husband and I loved this hotel. Great location, wonderful staff, and excellent room. There is a cool little blues bar in the basement with amazing bar tenders whether your into mixology or you just want a good drink they will impress.  I had a ""head to toe"" treatment at the spa which was the best facial and massage I have ever had. ",5,2016,12,16
29,El Palace is a Palace,"Beautiful old world décor. Very attentive and helpful staff, always with a smile. The most comfortable beds. Wonderful breakfasts. Amazing roof terrace with views, restaurant, bar and pool.  Pretty well everything was perfect. could easily have stayed for ever

(The only area that could be improved is that having had afternoon tea in the bedroom the used cups etc. were not cleared away and replaced in the evening, even though the maids came in the evenings to turn the bed down.)",5,2016,12,13
29,Gorgeous break,"Fantastic, traditional hotel. The doormen even chasing me out trying to put my coat on for me. Loved our room and ensuite. Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. Great location for sightseeing.

",5,2016,12,07
29,One gets what one pays for at this Grand Hotel,"We stayed at the El Palace Hotel for one night and enjoyed it immensely.  The hotel is decorated in early 20th century style with staff in full livery.  The room was large (suite) with an excellent bathroom; updated and in perfect order.  The bed was very comfortable.  Wifi was fast and in working order.  The room was beautiful and clean.  The staff was professional and provided accurate and helpful advice.

The location was very convenient, 2 blocks from the Placa de Catalunya and the Ramblas.

We did not have the breakfast and the spa/fitness center were not open so I can't comment.

One gets what one pays for.  I plan to return.",5,2016,12,03

Hotels seems like photos, Not easy to find! Thank you!'",4,2016,12,01
29,Gorgeous place to stay,"Wow! Such a beautiful building. The rooms are small, but not more than usual for Europe. The breakfast was outstanding and set in a light and airy room. Easy access to great restaurants and shops just minutes from the hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2016,11,30
29,Lovely Hotel,"El Palace Hotel is a lovely and spacious hotel.  The rooms are beautiful and very large with lots of closet and storage space.  The bathroom is very large with double sinks, a separate shower and bathtub.  The service at the hotel is wonderful, excellent English is spoken by all hotel staff and everyone is very helpful and accommodating.  The shared spaces are comfortable and beautifully decorated.  The intimate bar downstairs is a great place for a cocktail.  It is a very good location with most attractions within walking distance, but a 15-20 walk.",5,2016,11,29
29,Perfect Hotel,"The Palace Hotel is a great place to stay while in Barcelona. Centrally locate and within Walking distance of 4/5 top attractions in Barcelona.The room are.. tops and the staff cordial and personal.  
take the breakfast including option and you will not be disappointed, it is worth the price.    There is a top restaurant at the hotel, but have to plan ahead for reservation. There is a Jazz bar in the lower levels. The hotel is also very kid friendly..Sorry could not test the pool, which is outisde in the roof.( it was November and a bit cold), but the view was great. enjoy.",5,2016,11,28

29,Beautiful hotel great location,"Can't fault this hotel, beautiful furnishings, complimentary upgrade and bottle of cava and chocolates for our anniversary, amazing breakfast, very helpful staff, would definitely stay here again. Walking distance for sight seeing.",5,2016,11,22
29,One night before our cruise,"We got upgraded to a beautiful rooms.  Very spacious with excellent amenities.
Staff was most helpful and they allowed us to take our tour on morning of check out and return to our room before going to our cruise ship.

The breakfast buffet was pricey and not included in room price.",5,2016,11,14
29,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed at the El Palace for 2 nights, pre-cruise, on 11/3. We arrived early-afternoon after exhausting flights from the west coast and were greeted by the friendly doorman who whisked our bags away and pointed us to the reception office which is tucked just off the main lobby. Fortunately, our room was available and we were escorted to our room by Javier, who took the time to explain all the amenities the hotel had to offer on our way up to the room. We checked into room 604 (the top floor for rooms). We had a lovely view overlooking the Gran Via. The room was spacious, as was the bathroom with double sinks, separate bath, shower and wc. The room was beautifully decorated and I found the beds to be amazingly comfortable. My husband commented on the large number of pillows on the bed for a hotel, to which I replied, ""it makes me feel like I'm at home!"" They have a pillow menu, so if you don't like the pillows they've provided in your room (I think there are 6 on the bed in varying degrees of fluffiness), you can order to your liking. The sheets are worth a mention as well...silky soft cotton, probably the softest sheets I've experienced in a hotel recently! Our rate included breakfast which was served in the Winter Garden from 7-11 every morning. It was an ample offering and was a good start to our day. We enjoyed cocktails in the lobby bar one evening before dinner and cocktails in the beautiful little bar downstairs from the lobby after dinner, where they played live music. The bar service there was superb and the atmosphere is fun. The hotel is centrally located near everything you want to see and do in Barcelona. When we come back to Barcelona, we will definitely call the El Palace home.",5,2016,11,12
29,Beautiful,This was our second stay at the palace hotel and it didn't disappoint. As we had stayed there 3 years before they upgraded our room and even sent up a box of chocolates. The room was extremely nice and the staff couldn't do enough for you. Would stay here again.,5,2016,11,11
29,Post-Cruise Stay!,Excellent hotel in a great location with the Sagrada Familia and other popular sites all a short taxi ride away. Great customer service from the moment you arrive. You're escorted to the front desk for check-in and then to your room so they can familiarize you with it. The room was very luxurious and comfortable.,5,2016,11,10
29,Fabulous Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We found this to be a great location for all the sites in Barcelona. The staff are amazing; helpful with directions, giving us an early check in after an overnight flight, cabs, ideas, holding our bags on the last day, opening doors and saying hello every time we passed through the lobby. The drinks we had in the fabulous rooftop bar were the best on our trip. Our room was stunning! A corner room overlooking the main street. Beautiful. We hope to return, both to Barcelona and El Palace.",5,2016,11,09
29,Old splendor with a modern twist,"The hotel has all the splendor of an old luxury hotel with the addition of high standard modern amenities. Our room was amazing, a sunken roman bath with an extremely large walk in shower. The room was beautifully decorated and had every comfort you could possibly wish for.  The staff at the El Palace are amazing, nothing is too much trouble, they made us feel like royalty.  We spent a wonderful afternoon on the roof terrace, swimming and sunbathing.  The El Palace is in a great location for visiting Barcelona's tourist attractions, there are lovely cafes and shops right on your doorstep.  If you want a luxury experience you should book a stay in the El Palace.",5,2016,11,06
29,Fantastic hotel!!,"Fantastic hotel! Best hotel I've ever stayed at. Thank you to Maribel from Rom clearing and Alexis in concierge for returning my wallet on a silver platser while I was having breakfast before I knew I had lost it! 
The rooms my nephew and I stayed at where both luxurious and cosy. Both Classic and very modern and warm!",5,2016,11,06
29,A beautiful stay,"Staying at El palace with my parents and our 2 year old daughter for one week was a truly amazing experience. At a first glance the hotel is an okd grand hotel but in fact it has been thoroughly renovated a few years ago so you'll find all the amenities yor're looking for at a very high standard. 
The rooms (junior suite and privilege junior suite with two seperated rooms to have your privacy while the kid is asleep) are state of the art, spacious, with huge bathrooms (tub with jacuzzi and rain forest shower included). Lovely and comfy beds. No balcony which is not a problem as you have a wonderful roof garden with a small pool and more than enough space to spend an afternoon drinking wine on a couch or sleep on a day bed. Our rooms were facing to the courtyard, what makes them very quiet. The only thing I missed, was a Nespresso machine which I consider standard at such a level of hotel, but I have to admit that I'm spoiled...
There are three restaurants, all serve high quality food at an according price (compared to the restaurants in the city it is pricy off course...). The lobby restaurant serves apart from an amazing modern spanish cuisine (e.g. Black rice, tapas) the usual burgers and club sandwiches for those in need...
The rooftop restaurant has brilliant food, although portions tend to be small when you'r not going for the whole menu.
Breakfast in the wintergarden offers all you need and could ask for.
One of the biggest surprises to us was the fact that all the staff, beginning from the roommaids, the doormen to the waitresses and waiters at the restaurants are extremely friendly and helpful. Something you do not experience often in the big city hotels. Traveling with a young kid it helps a lot when you don't get the constant feeling to disturb people...
What needs to be highlighted is the concierge team: before our trip I contacted them with a few extra wishes (bottlewarmer, transfer bookings, restaurant reservations and a lot more) and it all worked out brilliantly. Extremely helpful, great tips and tricks and always very friendly.
Concerning the location nothing to say: a 3 min walk from Place Catalunya, Passeig de Garcia for shopping right down the street, taxis always in front of the house, some very good restaurants (e.g. Patagonia: brilliant steak house) right next to the hotel: so could not be any better.
It was definitely not our last stay!",5,2016,11,04
29,Best of both worlds,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and we were overwhelmed by the hotel options, whether to stay at a modern property or a more traditional one. We settled on El Palace because of a preference for so-called old world luxury or grand hotels (El Palace was a Ritz in the days when Salvador Dali lived in it). We indeed found here old world luxury in architecture and in the grand rooms, as well as contemporary efficiency. We took a junior suite, the room was elegant, quiet and beautifully maintained by the housekeeping staff. There is a lot of foot and motor traffic on the nearby and delightful Passeig de Gracia and Ramblas streets, but being a couple of blocks away El Palace is tranquil and relaxing. Their concierge team is first rate, we were given fantastic restaurant recommendations and meticulous, courteous help with every enquiry. Their selection of a guide for the Park Guell and Sagrada Famillia, etc. Javier Sanchez (who met us at the hotel) was a god-send; in 50 years of travel we've never had such a fine guide. Next time we will eat in the hotel's Caelis restaurant which was fully booked with plenty of chic locals.",5,2016,11,03
29,Top Notch,"We stayed at El Palace for 5 nights in late October.  Our room (502) overlooked Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes however we heard almost no noise from the street.  Our room was a good size and the bed and bathroom were just what you would expect at a 5 star property in Europe.  The bar and common areas of the hotel are beautifully designed and furnished.  The staff of the hotel were all pleasant, helpful and multi-lingual.  The concierges were particularly helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations.  Breakfast is a bit pricy however that seems to be par for the course at the better hotels in town.  The hotel's central location enabled us to walk to most of Barcelona's sights and we were able to walk to great restaurants on 4 of our 5 nights.  Highly recommended!",5,2016,11,03
29,Deserve to stay there as longer as possible,"The Hotel El Palace in Barcelona presented me beautiful memories about the city. I truly fell in love with the city and the hotel. The place is very convenient for people who love shopping firstly. It is also suitable for people who enjoy strolling down around the city as El Palace located next to shopping district. However, it is also close to other city sightseeing. 
Staying in the hotel, i was amazed by service. I cannot fault it in any way.The hotel staff is very friendly and well trained. 
Interior is mesmerizing, you will enjoy staying here. Every day, after getting up, i was getting a move on 7th floor to have breakfast with the beautiful panoramic view!",5,2016,11,02
29,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for 6 nights for a special anniversary.  Great location, lovely room, outstanding staff (especially concierge), really good food.  Old world atmosphere and attention to detail.  Highly recommend.",5,2016,11,01
29,"Perfect stay, great location ","We are a family of 3 who stayed here for 4nts during our first visit to Barcelona. What a lovely hotel. Great staff, great location. We were upgraded to a suite which was tucked away at the back of the hotel. It was wonderfully quiet. The room was very comfortable. Lovely bed, sofa bed ( for our 13yr old son) choice of pillows, tea/ coffee making facility and well equipped bathroom. 
The location was ideal; far enough away from the hustle & bustle of Las Ramblas, yet in easy walking distance. Apart from taking the Tour bus on a couple of occasions, we walked everywhere. We did not take the breakfast option as there were plenty of other options nearby and we enjoyed experiencing the different choices available. 
The hotel is also in easy walking distance of the beach; it was a very pleasant walk; all flat. Plenty of nearby shops and restaurants too. Every evening we enjoyed a walk after dinner; plenty to see and some lovely Gaudi buildings nearby. 
We will definitely return.",5,2016,10,31
29,Perfect!,"I love this hotel!  It's centrally located, has a gorgeous old-world lobby and all the amenities of a first-class luxury hotel, including smartly dressed, attentive porters and doormen and a friendly, helpful concierge. It's rooms are beautifully appointed, large, and quiet.  It's truly wonderful place.  While not cheap, after staying at a mid-range hotel in Madrid for the same rate, we felt it was a decent value.  It's so perfect I wish I could live there.",5,2016,10,29
29,Amazing hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is amazing from the time you are greeted by the doorman. All the staff have fantastic super customer service skills. Every single detail was over the top. There is a fabulous restaurant on the roof with glorious views and a giant breakfast that is simply delicious. the views are so breathtaking of the city. the location is perfect and so easy to walk to shops, restaurants and sites. If you love being pampered, this is the place. We will always stay here when we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,10,27
29,"Amazing property, awsome experience","You can tell this hotel is a class act from the first glimpse.  Absolutely gorgeous exterior, lobby, lobby bar/restaurant makes you feel like you'll be dining with the King and Queen.  Extremely attentive staff, beautiful suite, crazy gorgeous 'man cave' of a subterranean lounge below the lobby, Two-Michelin-Star restaurant on site (Caelis) which was outstanding.  Concierge arranged car rental without a hitch.
Definitely a destination for a special occasion.  Will definitely return.",5,2016,10,25
29,Amazing,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel and the doorman helped us with our luggage, we knew we were going to be well taken care of.  Every employee we came in contact with was cheerful, polite and extremely helpful.  The concierge gave us a quick tour of the beautiful lobby and escorted us to our room.  We contacted the hotel in advance about a special occasion we were celebrating. A bottle of cava, chocolate and a note were waiting for us in our room. The hotel was completely refurbished and no expense was spared. Our room was magnificent and over the top.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the amenities were deluxe. Although the Palace is on the busy Gran Via, the room was soundproof and we could not hear street noise unless we opened the window. We had lunch one day in the panoramic rooftop restaurant.  Another reviewer recommended the club sandwich and a glass of chardonnay.  The table was set with china and linen. The meal was delicious!
The concierge helped us with advance tickets to the Picasso museum.  If we needed a taxi the concierge or doorman got one for us and told the cab driver where we were going.  We were guests at the hotel for three nights.  It was a hotel we will always fondly remember.",5,2016,10,25
29,Incredible stay,We were celebrating our 25th anniversary. The hotel was just gorgeous and the rooms were spacious and beautiful. Service was excellent and location was perfect. One night we went down to the lounge for live music which was great!,5,2016,10,25
29,"One of , if not THE best in Barcelona","From the outside the entrance is luxurious but gives way to 20th century splendour in the common areas and bedrooms. Most of the bedrooms are large, some being suited with dressing rooms and enormous bathrooms with twin basins and showers.
The service from the staff is some of the best I have encountered in any country, and they are all both friendly courteous and efficient.
The facilities can be viewed on their website, and are too numerous to mention in this review, but the roof top pool, restaurant and sun area/bar are to die for.
The breakfast selection is as one would expect in a five star hotel, but better than in many I have stayed in.
The jewel in the crown is the Michelin starred restaurant Caelis, which is a must.",5,2016,10,23
29,"Classic, Old World Feel","Wonderful stay at El Palace from the efficient, helpful and doting staff to the up to date comfortable rooms, the gorgeous roof top patio to the elegant Hall both which were relaxing retreats after a day of sightseeing. El Palace is strategically located close to many of the popular tourist areas, but just enough away to give a little peace and quiet from the crowds. Everything was in walking distance.",5,2016,10,20
29,All the modern service with,"Beautiful historic hotel in a lovely area of Barcelona. Close to the metro and major attractions with nice shops and restaurants nearby. Extremely helpful staff and service. Excellent modernization common areas and spacious rooms. There are three restaurants, spa and workout facility. It was just perfect for our short stay!",5,2016,10,19
29,El Palace Cinco Stars in every way,"We stayed at El Palace for a week while visiting Daughter who is studying there.  The hotel is elegant and grand without being stuffy.  The location is walking distance from many sights of the city and good restaurants.  There is a rooftop bar that serves drinks and snacks and a 360 degree view.  The club sandwich and a nice glass of chardonnay became my go-to lunch in Barcelona.  The downstairs lounge is welcoming and beautiful.  Our room was perhaps the most quiet room we have ever enjoyed in a large city, even though you could open the windows!  The concierge was helpful in finding tickets to the soccer game and city tours.  Highly recommend!!",5,2016,10,19
29,Great hotel!!,"We just spent 4 days in this magnificent hotel and we were more than happy with the excelent service of the staff and the beauty of El Palace Hotel. 
Great location, 2 blocks from the Via de Gracia, 3 blocks from La Rambla. 
Breakfast was included in our room rate, it was great and very complete. 
Our room had a very good size, big bathroom with separated bathtub and double vanity sink. Large towels. Safe inside the closet. Everything was very clean and correct. 
Bed was very comfortable. There was a pillow menu. 
Room service was very good and fast enough.
There is an one Micheline restaurant (Caelis) inside the hotel, but I don't have an opinion about it since we didn't dine in there. 
Every member of the staff was very polite, correct and did an excelent work making us have such a great time. 
Special mention to Marcelino (doorman), Javier (door bell) and Francisco (concierge). 
Definetly, we'll get back to this hotel next time in Barcelona!",5,2016,10,15
29,This a wonderful hotel...What else can you say.,"This is a beautiful hotel located in a very nice area. You are walking distance to everything. Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia and the Gothic district. There is a great breakfast in the morning. The staff is gracious and very knowledgeable. If we come back, this will be our first choice of stay.",5,2016,10,13
29,ELEGANT CLASSIC HOTEL,"The El Palace, formerly the Ritz, is a Classic Old World elegant hotel a few blocks from the Ramblas, but away from the crowds.
The Hotel retains the feel of it's classic beginnings, but not in a worn way.
The lobby and restaurant areas are full of elegant and lovely appointments and furniture.
The rooftop contains a small pool and pretty dining area for light lunch.
The staff and concierges were warm and helpful.
Our room was a two room junior suite with a bath and a half.
The room appointments were lovely. We had huge closet space and lots of dimmable lights. The bathroom was beautiful and very modern.
.",5,2016,10,08
29,Almost too perfect,"As others have said, this is a beautifully renovated, well-situated and elegant hotel.  The rooms are well-appointed and wonderfully comfortable.  And the staff, especially the concierge team, are incredibly friendly and helpful.  We could not have asked for more.  That said, the hotel was almost too formal and elegant.  What we love about Barcelona is it's life and vitality--it's color and energy.  The El Palace provides quiet respite, but we missed some of the vibrance that is Spain.  Fortunately, it was just out the door.",4,2016,10,05
29,A Jewel in Barcelona,"This centrally located beautiful hotel is aptly named. As soon as you enter the hotel  , you are greeted and treated like a king and queen by the wonderful and courteous staff. Then you behold the sumptuous and elegant lobby which further leads into several lushly carpeted and voluptuous foyers which then leads to a spectacular harlequin black and white majestic restaurant. But the best of all, there is a spectacular rooftop 360 "" view of Barcelona above the terrace restaurant which is to die for. We were there every night (pretty much by ourselves) enjoying the scenery and were fortunate enough up there to see a fireworks show from the Gothic quarter in celebration of a festival honoring one of their saints. We can't say enough about the friendly staff, especially the concierge who recommended to us, a restaurant , BarBas in the Las Ramblas area. BarBas had the best octopus dish and catalan bread by far. When in the Las Ramblas area, be sure to try El Quim for breakfast in the Boquerria Market (if you don't like crowds don't go) but it's a feast for the senses. When in the Gothic Quarter,  we loved Cafe DeL'Academia (quiet and dark but the locals go there) and for great all you can eat  tapas (out of the tourist trap area) go to Maitea D'Taberna  . We never had trouble getting taxis that seem to pop up everywhere. Tipping isn't required but we did it anyway. We met some terrific people  Be sure to bring comfy footwear since walking is a must . If you go, try to do it when the weather is cooler there in Spring or Fall to make walking around more comfortable.",5,2016,10,05
29,Perfect!!!,"Located at the best part of the city walking distance to everywhere, you can see Sagrada Familia from your balcony, breakfast at hotel is must!! Rich open buffet. Hotel is up to its name you feel like you are a visitor of a palace thank you see you next time.",5,2016,10,04
29,What an elegant hotel!,"This hotel was one of the most beautiful, charming, totally renovated hotels I've ever stayed in! Our room was very large and high up so it was very quiet (it also faced a side street). The staff was wonderful and the restaurant recommendations from the concierge and help finding places on a map were excellent. I guess the only negative to us since our budget isn't unlimited was the cost of items on the room service menu. I passed on my usual morning coffee because it was 7 euros ($8 - $9 U.S). The location on the beautiful Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes was within easy walking distance of the Plaza Cataluna which is the center of all, so it was easy to walk most places. I loved it and would return in a heartbeat!",5,2016,10,03
29,Sentimental return to the Old Ritz,"We stayed at the Ritz on our first visit to Barcelona many years ago and decided we would visit it again in its new identity - El Palace.  We were not disappointed.  Great location.  We were made welcome from the first greeting by the porter to the bellboy who showed us to our room.  Our room was on the 5th floor with internal courtyard views.  Plenty of light, plenty of space, lovely bathroom, lots of hanging space.  Fabulous!  The concierge staff were fantastically helpful in all respects - restaurant suggestions, tickets, directions. We've been travelling for 2 months and the concierge staff at El Palace were the best we've dealt with.  They should be congratulated.  The hotel has been beautifully renovated although the elevators were a little slow.  The hotel is spacious and quiet and welcoming.  The breakfast area is lovely and light.  Sometimes it is not just the location or the hotel group - it is the staff that makes a hotel special.  And the concierge staff at El Palace made us feel very special and welcome.  It is elegant and friendly.  The best combination.",5,2016,10,02
29,luxury and great location what more do you want,"old world luxury, nice rooms, great location, sound proof rooms, excellent concierge, rooftop pool and restaurant, nice lounge downstairs, great looking breakfast. Nice spa, not part of the hotel, great steam room, concierge were excellent with their recommendations, close to everything, highly recommend it in Barcelona",5,2016,09,30
29,Old world charm....first class service,"Our first 4 nights in Spain were spent at the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona. From the moment we checked in, the staff was excellent. We had requested a room on a high floor with a view overlooking the front street, and that is exactly what we got. Shortly after arriving, we were given a welcome bottle of Cava (a Spanish sparkling wine) along with a note from the general manager. A nice touch.

The concierge was extremely helpful, and made dinner reservations for us on a couple of evenings. 

This hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, La Ramba, and many other interesting places. 

I loved the fact that our windows opened, and I was able to enjoy a glass of wine while looking out onto the Gran Via. Also, they have an ""old school"" tradition of leaving your room key with the concierge when you leave the building, and picking it up when you come back. Very quaint. Our room was very quiet at night as they have very good windows which dramatically cut down on the sound. 

This is a very classy hotel which is clearly worth the 5 star rating.",5,2016,09,30
29,Awesome and So Comfortable,"This was such a nice hotel experience from the moment we checked in until we left. The staff always wanted to help and were extremely friendly. The room itself was lovely and super comfortable. We flew straight from the US and so the blackout shades came in really handy the first two days until jet lag eased. El Palace was the perfect home base for frequent jaunts to the Born, Barceloneta, the Gothic Quarter and the beach. Even the walk from Park Guell was amazing.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and were ready to help us find our way around town.  Leaving the key when we departed every day was a nice touch of yester year too.  Would definitely stay here again.  The hotel was built in 1919 and was a grand old dame.  Nice common areas, a very nice room and one of the most comfortable beds on our entire trip.  The blackout shades helped ease jet lag quickly too.  We didn't include the breakfast on our plan.  The buffet was nice, and we ate it two of the days anyway but after a few days we figured out that croissants at the place across the street and a cafe hit the spot just as nicely and didn't load us up with unnecessary calories.  Barca is a walking city anyway, and we walked 7-10 days every day so we could eat what we wanted.  I recommend the Palace.
",5,2016,09,27
29,Superb hotel in perfect location,"Beautiful, large and elegant room and top modern, large and stylish bathroom. Outstanding 360 degree view from the top terrace over the city including Sagrada Familia. Just on the floor below is the roof top pool which is heaven to cool down in after a day of excursions. Excellent service and friendly staff.  We will be back!",5,2016,09,26
29,To the Manor Born,"This hotel brings back old world charm combined with all the modern conveniences you might wish for. The staff is exceptional, the grounds simply beautiful and the location assures a quiet retreat from the bustle of Lisbon. We stayed for 4 days and couldn't have been happier with everything. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,09,25
29,The old Ritz Barcelona ,"Stayed here 35 years ago under a different owner. (The Ritz) Very little has changed one the first few floors. They have a Michelin 1 one the first floor. The new restaurant is on the 7th floor which was not here so many years ago. We ate at this restaurant by the pool last night. The food was very good, but the service left a lot to be desired! The Maitre D explained due to large group ( which we never saw) two waiters for 5 occupants. This hotel has better standards and service then we experienced.
",5,2016,09,23
29,Perfect Barcelona Accommodations!,"My husband and I had the wonderful experience of visiting Barcelona with several other couples. Our stay at El Palace was completely perfect from start to finish. We arrived early in the day and were greeted warmly by several Hotel staff members. They welcomed us warmly and assisted us with our checkin and luggage storage needs before we ventured off for a day of sight seeing before getting into our rooms. The entrance area was stunningly decorated with fresh flowers and lovely ornate finishes.  The extended lobby area is absolutely glamorous yet comfortable for lounging day or night. We met often in the lobby bar for drinks, tapas and conversation.  Our room was VERY comfortable and roomy. A private entrance hallway, a little outdoor balcony looking out over an idilic Barcelona side street, a comfortable king sized bed with our choice of a variety of pillows, and a bathroom with lots of storage/closet/drawer space for unpacking our suitcases as well as a private toilet and separate glass shower and soaking tub. Our daily breakfast in the patio restaurant was completely ""over the top"" wonderful. Delicious and beautifully presented fare representing many international food choices. Our wish was their command at every moment. We would highly recommend this beautiful Barcelona treasure.",5,2016,09,22
29,Authentic luxury hotel,"My husband and I spent a lovely three nights at El Palace Hotel.  We especially  loved the authentic classic atmosphere.  Unlike other ""chain"" hotels that have hotels all over Europe, El Palace Hotel was unique.  The service was outstanding and our room was beautiful.  We had a splendid view of the city.  If and when we return to Barcelona, we will stay at El Palace Hotel without a doubt.",5,2016,09,21
29,An excellent hotel,"We taxied in from Sants railway station after a train ride from Madrid. Our check-in was seamless. We asked for a higher room and had decided to take an inside room for quietness.  It was a sentimental journey for us as we had stayed here over 20 years ago on our first trip to Barcelona. The room was spacious with plenty of clothes hanging space. The shower is the best we have experienced on this trip to Spain. The concierges are to be congratulated - they are simply the best - and nothing was a problem and they were so helpful with getting tickets for us. The breakfasts in the covered garden are first rate. The restaurant, Nineteen 19, is flawless and we enjoyed two of the most tasty steaks imaginable. We had drinks with friends. We saw the pool but didn't use it - there just wasn't enough time! The hotel location is excellent and its a joy to immediately get a taxi. The luxury style still rates up there with the best.
",5,2016,09,19
29,Excellent Luxurious Hotel,"This hotel was perfect from start to finish, a true 5 star hotel. On arrival the check-in staff upgraded us to a suite as we were staying for our 10th wedding anniversary. The room was absolutely stunning with an original roman bath and super king size bed. The hotel left a bottle of cava in our room as well.. This hotel used to be the Ritz and you can see why from the luxury décor and furniture all around you. The concierge staff were extremely helpful and recommended and booked two restaurants for us. We had not booked breakfast with our room, but you can still go for breakfast and choose between a continental or full breakfast. Both options were excellent and the breakfast lounge and garden area are lovely. The hotels location is also excellent, we were approx. a 10 minute walk from the main square where you can book and pick up the tour buses or walk down ramblers area. The perfect hotel for a romantic stay in Barcelona we cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2016,09,19
29,A perfect choice: a grand hotel that isn't stuffy,"If a grand duke were seeking the ultimate grand hotel, this might be it. Starting life as the Ritz Hotel in 1919, it has now been thoroughly modernized. It still has drapes as heavy as raccoon coats, and the doormen are still dressed like field marshals. But the guests might be wearing polo shirts and sneakers. 

The location is ideal: right in the middle of the elegant 19th Century enlargement of the city, but within walking distance of Gaudi masterpieces and medieval churches alike.  

Our room was huge, and so was its closet. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. There was a real entrance hall with a door that closed. The huge bathroom had a very welcome stall shower as well as a tub. In seven nights, we never heard any noise at all from another room.

We're glad we asked for a room on a high floor because we had a direct view of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia church (as well as the construction cranes on its site, of course). Also, this particular room overlooked the very busy Gran Via. While the soundproofing on the windows was very effective, it didn't block out all the traffic noise. We had no trouble sleeping, but we suspect that rooms on the lower floors might get more noise. 

Service at the hotel was friendly and efficient, and not at all stiff. The breakfast buffet, served in a pleasant covered garden, was excellent. 

The hotel has a roof deck with a stunning view and pleasant areas to sit.  There is even a narrow pool, though it didn't seem to get much use while we were there. A restaurant on the roof had a great view, especially at night. On the one night we at there, the food was fine, but the service seemed a bit slow.

Mundane tip:  Oddly enough, it paid to carry around the name and address of the hotel. A number of Barcelona hotels have the word ""palace"" in their names, including one near El Palace. Three cab drivers had trouble with the location, though the problem disappeared when they grasped that this was the former Ritz Hotel. Everyone seemed to know the Ritz. 

Overall, our week at El Palace was ideal. Essentially, there was nothing not to like. We also thought our rate of around 400 euros a night, including breakfast, was good value. We would certainly go back.",5,2016,09,18
29,Great hotel,"The hotel has a beautiful charm with its old world decor. 

Location is great and convenient. 

But it's the staff that stand out. Every member we interacted with was professional and very friendly. Nothing was a hassle and they were always keen to help. ",4,2016,09,17
29,Wonderful visit,"Everything about this hotel and our stay was wonderful.  
The people were all terrific, the room was great, the food even better. Xavier was a delight.
It is in a great location for walking to the sites and a close cab ride if you prefer.

Nothing but good things to say about it, a favorite for us now.",5,2016,09,15
29,A Shining Jewel in Barcelona ,"We were ""wowed"" from check-in to check-out. The service at this ornate, gem of a hotel was outstanding. 

The public spaces and rooms are, in a word, palatial. The lobby was lavish, something out of a fairy tail. There wasn't a piece of furniture, painting or drape out of place. The flowers in the lobby were gorgeous and perfectly matched the grand design of the salon. 

The guest rooms are large and spacious. I stayed in a deluxe room and found it incredibly spacious and comfortable. The damask wallpaper had a muted tone, which blended well with the chic furnishings. The regency style of the room was not stuffy or over-the-top, it was actually soothing. The  beds were heavenly, the crisp white linens were stuffed with fluffy feathers, which made for excellent rest. 

The bathroom had a rainfall shower and separate tub. Many amenities were provided in the bathroom, which was a relief when I forgot to pack my toothbrush. 

On to my favorite part of the hotel; The Rooftop! The roof of this hotel has 180 degree views of Barcelona. You can see everything from the Sagrada Familia to the Mediterranean Sea. The pool is small, but only a small annoyance given the gorgeous view. The lounge chairs are a little short, one can't rest their entire leg on it. At night, climb a little higher to an even a smaller terrace, which is like a candlelit garden in the sky. The wind, the sight, the vibes are unforgettable. 

All the staff including doormen, concierge, maids and bar staff are extremely helpful, without being obtrusive. 

I recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a true 5-star experience. This hotel is a luxurious sanctuary in the beautiful Barcelona.  ",5,2016,09,14
29,"The old Ritz, old world charm","Stayed 3 nights here, the hotel is in a very good central area, just missed the mark in a few areas. Shower was very difficult to turn on and off, after upgrading my room still had no separate shower and shower rise was hard against wall resulting in water going into bathroom. 
Breakfast was very good in a lovely room, could improve bar area downstairs, very dated. Maybe they might get Ritz name back with small improvements. Tip, do not wear a watch or jewelry out at night. Had attempted mugging outside hotel! 
Still a beautiful hotel with plenty of old world charm. ",4,2016,09,13
29,So Far....almost so good,"The hotel opens up with the look of luxury. You are led up to a nice room containing a walk in closet. Hidden behind a picture of decorative shelving is your mini bar. The desk has an electric kettle for tea or instant coffee.  The bathroom is small though well appointed. I wish there was more room for two people to get ready in the morning. It is very tight!
The concierge has been consistently wrong with restaurants. Last night we wanted a tapas restaurant but ended up walking out of this restaurant and coming back to hotel for dinner. The hotel restaurant was delicious and we were the only two people in it at 10pm.
So far we have not enjoyed a single meal outside the hotel! 
The Sagrada familia was certainly worth the time and audiobook. As was said get the ""skip the line"" tickets. The Picasso museum also as good as reviewed. We have two more days so more to come.",3,2016,09,13
29,Classic Luxury,"Excellent location. Close by shops, cafes, banks, etc. Easy cab rides to attractions. Luxurious palatial public rooms. Doorman took my hand luggage before I was even out of the cab. Excellent service. Outstanding Concierges. Ricard planned our two days and recommended restaurants. His advice was on the mark except he did not warn us that the shops were closed on Sunday and although we missed our shopping expedition he filled our time with excellent attractions to visit. My only complaint is that the larger Jr. Suite faced a courtyard. No view. But the room and bathroom were large and very comfortable. The decor was all in shades of gray which was dark for a room that faced a courtyard and did not get much natural light but that was minor next to all the pluses. Rooftop terraces and pool worth a visit. Lovely decor and views.",4,2016,09,12
29,Great,"Very nice hotel with great service. Roof top terrace and pool worth visiting, pool is small but works well. Breakfast very good and served until 11 am on weekends. Direct access to parking garage next door. Stayed in junior suite which was great.",5,2016,09,12
29,5 day holiday - superb,"Hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful. Facilities and rooms are excellent. Spent  every evening Thursday to Saturday from 11 pm to 2 am in basement cocktail bar where service and live music were wonderful. We will be back.
",5,2016,09,11
29,Grand!,"We stayed in the El Palace for 2 nights prior to boarding the Viking Sea for a Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel is, simply put, grand!
The rooms are a bit small by modern standards, but the bathroom and walk in closet more than make up for the size.  The rooftop pool is a treat and service is exemplary.  
Breakfasts at the restaurant are sumptuous and the small ""basement"" bar is a gem.  Great entertainment and an old school bartender who's a master of his craft.  Location is excellent as well.  
A wonderful place to stay.  Wished it could have been longer!",5,2016,09,11
29,Fantastic ,We recently stayed 3 nights before a cruise leaving from Barcelona.   This hotel is fantastic.   Great location.  Close to main el passeig as well as gothic district.   Staff is wonderful.   Great correspondence before travel dates.  Conceriege even helped arranged with doorman taxi service to and from a camp Nu game since it was our first time in Barcelona.    Would definitely stay again   ,5,2016,09,10
29,Great service,My husband and I stayed in the hotel for three nights. The room was very comfortable with good bedding and a spacious bathroom. The service from all the staff was pleasant and friendly. The concierge desk was particularly good. Their advice was excellent. Their guidance about where to go and what to do was brilliant. We would definitely recommend the hotel and will return on our next visit to Barcelona? ,5,2016,09,09
29,"El Palace is more than a Hotel , it´s a special experience!","This is our second time staying in this wonderful hotel. The staff are all very professional,  friendly and make you feel immediately at home with personal attention, at all times The bedrooms and beds are super comfortable and we had a room with a view overlooking the famous Sagrada Familia. The breakfast was the best international one that we have ever had, again with great attention from all the staff. We love it and we hope to return very soon to this 5 star luxury.",5,2016,09,07
29,The Afternoon Tea here was exceptional!,"What made it that way?  The rooftop terrace, it was so romantic and special and to have the lady in residence who painted the wall with the fountain was especially nice.  The service was outstanding and very professional.  The tea was delicious with a wonderful selection of sandwiches and sweets and of course teas.  The views up here were perfect...all in all just a super experience.  Highly recommend.",5,2016,09,07
29,Was glad to be back!,"I didn't realize when I booked here that we had stayed here before.  Imagine my surprise when we recognized the property!  We were thrilled to be back as the rooms are sumptuous and staff first-class.  

This hotel is perfectly located for getting to La Rambla and Sagrada Familia.  And the bar staff that evening made me the perfect Irish Coffee (I know...when in Spain...but it was something I really wanted).

Staff was also very helpful in making our reservations to see Sagrada Familia and directing us to the 'hop on hop off' bus tours.

Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2016,09,07
29,"My favorite hotel in Barcelona, Catalan Hospitality at its best","Last May I spent two weeks at El Palace the staff was extremely courteous and kind. The rooms were decorated in a modern yet classical style that I love, the location is close to the Passeig de Gracia which I love. The cuisine at the 19 restaurant and Caelis are excellent. The staff at the 19 restaurant was even so kind to make chocolate caliente con churros on my last night! How I miss their food! During my stay I also went to the Mayan Luxury spa which had excellent spa services such as massages and pedicures.  Molt gracies El Palace for all the the care you took of me during my two week stay, Barcelona will always hold a special place in my heart and you have solidified that. Hasta pronto, MM Corvez",5,2016,09,06
29,Excelent,"The hotel was excelent, the rooms clean and in good shape. The location superior. Walking distance from the center. The staff excelent and the concierge help a lot in finding restaurants and booking tours. The food in the restaurant at the back of the hotel was good and the service excelent. ",5,2016,09,05
29,Very pleasant stay with glitches ,"Our stay at the El Palace hotel which used to formerly be The Ritz was pleasant but it did lack quite a few things. 
Probably I am biased as we had just stayed at the Ritz in Madrid which arguably is the best hotel in Spain. 
The staff at El Palace are polite but not all are well trained and switched on. Not everyone was forth coming in wanting to help. Understandably not everyone performs the same but a hotel of this standard needs to put on a show every single time most importantly the front desk (reception). 

The rooftop restaurant and lounge is stunning and one of a kind. 
The location is excellent and yes we'll definitely go back there again. ",3,2016,09,02
29,Superb!,"My wife, two year old daughter and I spent 3 nights here in one of the junior suites. The room itself was furnished to a high standard, had a separate living room and an enormous bathroom. The rooftop hotel pool was a great spot to retire to after a day exploring the city! The level of service was equally outstanding! The location is fantastic (equidistant to the Passeig de Gracia and the Born/Gothic quarters. Would definitely return again!",5,2016,08,30
29,"Good stay, not quite perfect","Firstly- this feels like walking into the Ritz in London, wonderful common parts and really special roof top pool.  Rooms were well appointed. Staff generally helpful but a couple of gripes- I just don't expect this at a 5* hotel:

the pool closes at 6pm.  Not sure many of the guests realise this and when we were there a staff member (I think from the rooftop restaurant)  just barged in and told everyone unceremoneously that the pool had closed, and started to bustle around moving chairs.  Could have been handled more diplomatically!

Conceirge can be super, booking trips etc, but when we asked for our luggage to be brought down for a certain time, and we went out in the interim, our taxi then had to wait whilst they brought it down- costing us real money.  A bit shoddy as they should be able to follow up a simple agreed instruction.

These are minor gripes though, i'd definitely recommend the place and breakfast was decent although nothing special",4,2016,08,30
29,Luxury has new name,"We're chosen Barcelona as our last destination between France and Spain, yes the hotel is little bit pricy, but guess what you get what you pay for, from the moment you enter the premises you know you are in for a treat, the hotel is like no other, majestic, old and modern all in one palace. 
If visiting Barcelona do yourself a favor spend couple of night in the palace, I will certainly be back. 
Location- central
Bed Comfort- 9
Staff- 10  ",5,2016,08,24
29,Amazing!,"Probably one of the best 5* hotels I have ever stayed in. It is both Elegant and sophisticated, but also welcoming. The staff are very friendly and can't do enough to make you feel comfortable. I especially want to compliment the concierge team as they are pretty outstanding. You will never open a door or carry bags or luggage because they are immediately there at your side to assist you, nothing is too much trouble for them. Special thanks to Juan who was always there to assist me with whatever I needed. I did not eat in the hotel, due to the fact that I was sightseeing most of the time, but I understand that the restaurants are superb. The hotel is centrally located and is only minutes walk from most of the designer shops and the Rambles. I can highly recommend this hotel it is every bit 5*!! Thank you El Palace for an amazing weekend. Fiona Munro",5,2016,08,24
29,Superb,"We booked in here at the end of our trip to Spain as a wind down and chill out place from the hustle and bustle of Spain in the height of the tourist season.
From the moment we pulled up to the door in the car, we were greeted with consummate professionalism, from the Concierge to the cleaners. The service here is by far the best in the city and its considered in the top five in the whole of Spain (that comes from my Spanish friends) who rate this hotel amongst the finest, and i have to say i completely agree.
The rooms are neo classical design and furnishings with ultra modern hidden tech such as the TV being hidden in the large mirror. The bathroom and facilities were spotless, the bed was amazing quality and comfort and the pillows are to die for. The whole 3 day (2 night) stay here was exceptional. The only minor gripe i had was the size of the roof top pool, but apart from that this place IS THE PLACE to stay in BCN (and i have stayed in the city a fair bit over the years) 
Well done to the Palace staff, you made our vacation complete, nothing was too much trouble, from the very late night coffee request to the pool side cocktails, the breakfast room service to the roof top meal experience.
Simply the best in the city by far. I look forward to our next stay with you all.",5,2016,08,18
29,Wedding Anniversary treat!,"This hotel and all it's staff are first class. My husband booked this as a surprise treat for our wedding anniversary, we were upgraded to a suite, rose petals in the room, and bubbly on arrival! The room was luxurious! We can thoroughly recommend eating in the rooftop gastronomic restaurant, we had the taster board which they quickly adapted to our vegetarian diet, each dish a delight on the taste buds! The panoramic view from the roof top bar is not to missed. Our room was at the back of the hotel and although not a great view the room was light and airy, bed huge and very comfortable and the bathroom extremely spacious with his and hers basins, a jacuzzi bath and an extremely spacious double shower! It was a luxurious stay in the heart of Barcelona :)",5,2016,08,16
29,Old world updated.,"I happened across this hotel by chance two years ago when I was previously in Barcelona. I had lunch with a friend in their wonderful restaurant at the back of the hotel. As we left I saw the plaque on the outside that said it was previously the Ritz. So I had to bring my wife here to start of our four week Spanish holiday. 
As a member of the Leading Hotels of the World you get a room upgrade and free breakfasts. This makes the yearly membership fee worth the $199. 

The doorman is dressed in a grand manner and they whisk your bags inside. The guest relations manager came to greet us. A nice touch. They gave us a great room, large with an excellent walkin robe. The room was light with two large windows an comfortable seating. I had booked their standard room and got an upgrade as a LHW member. Unfortunately we only stayed one night in this room as there was construction happening in the hotel next door. The guest relationship manager went out of her way to find us another room of equal size and comfort. In fact this room had a huge bathroom with the biggest shower I have ever had in a hotel. 3 m2 in size at least! Seperate toilet, which is always the mark of a good hotel. Great beds and linen. Dark and quiet, at least in the back rooms. Although they don't have the view..except for the 6th floor.
It was my birthday and I arrived back to find delicious chocolate cake and champagne waiting for me. Mucho gracious. 
The main salon is superb. A reminder of times past, when there was elegance and style in grand hotels. The breakfast room was equally wonderful. Black and white tile in a light filled room. Several tables ran down the middle filled with an excellent choice. More than most hotels provide. The outdoor area was a quiet, breeze filled greenery courtyard with the sound of running water from the fountain. The most pleasant way to start the day. 
The hotel also has a fabulous bar downstairs. A plush velvet boudoir that is comfortable and cosy. The topping on the cake is the music. On Thursday and Friday they have a live band. The Thursday band was Reckless. Great R& B. A hot band, great guitar playing and a fabulous female vocalist. Check it out. There is also a lovely roof top pool and garden with a gastronomic restaurant. 
The hotel couldn't be better located. Just a five minute walk along the Gran Via to the huge Zara store and the central plaza. A great hotel, with excellent service all round. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,15
29,Stunning,"There are a few hotels in Europe I class as fantastic and classy in one sentence.  Opulent and pleasant at the same time. From drawing up in the car to checking out you are given 1st class treatment and you are made to feel as if you are the only one in the hotel. Food is incredible as are the cocktails. We had breakfast in our room....perfect....we had breakfast on the roof....even better. Fresh and tasty every time. 
My only negative point is the size of the pool area. But given this fact I would stay here every time. Its not your usual stuffy 5 star hotel....just enjoy yourself and let the amazing care the staff give you wash away the manic day in the city.

29,Great atmosphere,"We stayed 2 nights at El Palace Hotel in Barcelona and it was just amazing. The setup of the styles in the lounges there were just faboulous so it sometimes just felt like a dream there set at maybe 200 years ago in old times.
The food was excellent and also there the service and staff are very friendly. Location in the city is perfect also.
When we come back to Barcelona we will choose certainly that place again.",5,2016,08,05
29,Opulence,A well located hotel with a beautiful lobby that is welcoming and full of art. Modern amenities with old world grandure. Ask for a room with the Roman bath which they retained from it's former life as the Ritz but added modern marble and fixtures. The staff was friendly and helpful too. We would definatly stay there again!,5,2016,08,01
29,A beautiful hotel,"Formerly The Ritz, this restored hotel is stunning.  The location is excellent.  Note the internet speeds were awful and unacceptable for a luxury hotel. The staff and accommodations are first rate. Highly recommend if you want to stay in the older downtown section.  Also very quiet.",5,2016,07,30
29,Excellent,"What a wonderful surprise. Absolutely gorgeous hotel: and the best concierge EVER! Lovely lounge and teas, good food. The mirror in the room is a TV screen! Everything charming and definately a come-back hotel for our next time in Barcelona. The staff went out of their way to be friendly, everywhere were one either polishing the brass of sweeping one leaf on the patio. Spotless, old fashioned, glamorous.",5,2016,07,28
29,"Fantastic hotel, beautiful room, excellent service, great rooftop pool but so pricey","This hotel is beautiful, perfectly located 5 mins walk from the rambles and shops etc, the fantastic rooms, relaxing areas, roof top pool and sunning areas with great view of the unfinished cathedral, but why do they need to charge so much for their food and drinks? 

So, here's what to do.. .....They charge €29 pp for breakfast, we saw mixed reports on this so didn't try it, but just over the road is a lovely cafe (Alspur?) where for €10 you can sit in the cushion lined window seat and enjoy an lovely eggs benedict with ham, spinach and holendais with a coffee, great service and great atmosphere (3 night stay that's €120 saving) see where I'm going with this?!..... 

Now, the beautiful (and it is lovely) rooftop pool area, we got stung for €42 for a rum @ coke and a gin @ tonic, and €10 for a 330ml bottle of lager, obviously absolutely rediculouse, so.....over the main road to the right on the corner, there is a corner shop that sells cans of San Miguel for €2, so obviously you simply have say 3 of these from the fridge in your rucksack, buy the first drink at €10 and then keep it topped up through the afternoon, a saving of almost €25 per afternoon, that's another €100 for 4 days....I did treat the missus to a lovely strawberry dachary? For €21 and another gin and tonic over the 3 days......but the €1 bottles of water from the corner shop instead of €5 from the hotel made another €60 saving for the 4 days.!

The food menu is also really pricey, but over the road right next to the lovely breakfast cafe is a smashing sandwich and pastry place, perfect to tuck a couple of cheese croissants and puff pastries in your rucksack next to the lager and water, and take up to the rooftop pool area, round the side where the view of the cathedral is is good, ...and that's another good €50 (for 2) saving per lunch time....they also sell water at €1 a bottle!

Another plus for this lovely hotel is the evening entertainment that starts at 11.00 each night downstairs .....you best book a table, cuts the side seats ache your back after a while, but a lovely way to end the day.

When you first arrive, go to the very top of the roof, steps up from the roof top area to  another area right at the top...and get you're bearings for where the sea, cathedral is etc.

All in all, a fantastic place to stay.....and there's over €500 of savings for you !",4,2016,07,26
29,"Beautiful hotel, good service but......","The positives - beautiful hotel in good location. Staff are very nice. If you get a good rate this hotel is good but I wouldn't say it's a true top of the line experience. 

For example, each day I've had to ask housekeeping to either take away dirty cups (after they've come to clean room and left them there) or to please leave the coffee etc that comes with the room every day as they haven't replaced it as we've used it. So housekeeping lacks in that department. Minor things of course, but if this hotel rates itself a 5 star it should correct this. 

I would love to give this hotel 5 stars, but to me a 5 star hotel has all amenities a true 5 star hotel should have and this one doesn't. Specifically this is the worst hotel gym I have ever seen in 4-5 star hotel, there is one tiny set of hand weight and a few lame cardio pieces that don't work. I tried to use the restrooms located in the spa/where gym is located and was told absolutely not that I must go downstairs to use the bathroom. This was at 10 am when spa was empty. This has never happened in the many many years I've traveled in true 5 star hotels. It's the little things like this that make a difference between good hotels and truly excellent hotels. This note is good, not excellent. 

I lived in Barcelona for one year so I know the areas well - this hotel is in a good location to walk to almost all of the city. That's a definite positive. ",3,2016,07,26
29,Oasis in Barcelona,"The El Palace is an elegant, old world hotel situated a short walk from Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla. I stayed there two nights before a cruise, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The rooms are immaculate and well equipped with every convenience. The rooftop pool, while small,  was a welcome respite from the gritty hot streets of the city below. 
The staff went above and beyond. I didn't have any food there during my stay, so I cannot comment on it. 
The rates are high, but you definitely get that five star experience. I would not hesitate to recommend the El Palace hotel and would stay there again.

29,Great service in a beautiful hotel,"We arrived at 2:30am because of airline delays and the service at El Palace was amazing. Our rooms were ready and all of our prior requests were met (this does not happen very often in other hotels). We are a family of 6 and we were hungry, at 3am we ordered phenomonal room service, I was amazed at that the staff were so alert and helpful so early in the day, or late at night...however you look at it. 
The hotel is beautiful, lovely interior design and well worth your stay.",5,2016,07,23
29,An Amazing Five Star Experience,"I stayed at this hotel for five days while I was vacationing in Barcelona.  The hotel is amazing, as the other reviews will tell you, and it is well located in Barcelona, making it easy to get to where you want to be during the day.  Everything about the room was a five star experience.  Friendly staff, great times.  If I am in the Barcelona area again, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,22
29,Definitely 5-Stars!,"Not sure what to say scepter this hotel is exquisite. My wife and I stayed 4 nights in June and absolutely loved it. The staff is so nice and professional. We got several restaurant recommendations from the staff and all were fantastic. The hotel throughout, rooms and all areas, are gorgeous. Our room was pretty large too. The bar in the main lobby was a real treat. Especially nice is the rooftop bar, pool, and restaurant. Dinner up there one night really rocked our world. This is for people that want a romantic splurge. Crazy nice, highly recommended. Great location to get to all the sites as well. Beautiful!",5,2016,07,21

29,"Fantastic staff, service and location","We loved the hotel, they have a really good breakfast and the staff are all very friendly. we were travelling with our 4 month old son, so they put a travel cot in our room with some nice baby amenities.  The rooftop pool and seating area is awesome, fantastic views of the city.",5,2016,07,12
29,Fantastic!,"Stayed here for 4 nights, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The concierge and doormen were exceptionally knowledgable and helpful and made our holiday stress-free. We had adjoining rooms as my 15 year old son was with us, couldn't fault them.
Only downside was breakfast, it wasn't to as high a standard as the rest of the hotel.
Overall it was an amazing experience staying here and I can't wait to go back!",5,2016,07,08
29,"Soundproofed, quiet rooms","We reserved one of the smallest rooms and found the room and the bathroom to be quite spacious, well appointed, spotless and extremely quiet  - even though it was located right above the Grand Via.  The rooms are incredibly soundproof and guarantee a fantastic night sleep.  The service at the hotel is superior.  The front door staff is exceptional and friendly.  

The setbacks are minor:   The location is fine but not ideal.  It is in a fine and safe area  - but it is still quite a long walk to any neighborhood or attraction you would like to visit.  There is nothing interesting in the surrounding few blocks.  However the doormen are excellent at hailing taxis so that was quite helpful.  Secondly, the food is terrible.  I ordered a simple Cesar salad for lunch at the pool deck upon arrival and it was the worst salad I have ever eaten (swimming in dressing and extremely salty - in fact an entire bottle of salt must have been used).  I did not know it was possible to ruin a Cesar salad so completely.  I would not normally add this in a review but the cost of the salad was astronomical for something so small and unedible.",4,2016,06,30
29,Amazing!!!!,The hotel is amazing.  Would love to stay there for an entire week. Great staff! They are kind and very helpful.  If you can walk a mile or less you can get to most of the atrractions of Batcelona. Be prepared to have a wonderful stay.,5,2016,06,28
29,El Palace Hotel Barcelona,"The very best in old world elegance. One of most beautiful old hotels we have ever stayed in. From Xavier the bellman, to the beautiful Lithuanian/Spanish concierge, to the mirror over the fireplace in our room that is actually a TV; this hotel is what one imagines when the words luxurious hotel comes to mind. There was nothing about this hotel we did not truly enjoy.  

Make sure and sample the elegantly prepared Catalonian dishes in the restaurant. Even the simple sounding anchovies on Catalon tomato bread was delicious.

The Mercat on La Rambla is within walking distance, as Placa Central.",5,2016,06,27
29,A luxurious place to stay in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed at El Palace while we were in Barcelona and we were so pleased with everything!! The hotel was gorgeous, and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. We liked the location, and we appreciated the high level of service their staff provided. The concierge gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants and places to go that we wouldn't have found otherwise. We also indulged in the delicious breakfast each morning. It was a full buffet with everything you could want in a lovely dining area. We would love to stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it!!!",5,2016,06,25
29,A Fine City Hotel,"It's not often that I write about hotels, especially ones in cities. They are pretty much the same with some of the big names in the big cities, to me at least, completely overrated. 
BUT, then there is El Palace in Barcelona. This city center hotel (formerly a Ritz and now better off not being part of that group) is a truly special experience. 
What makes it special? Clearly it's the staff. The entry and lobby are grand in a 1920's way. The main ""living room"" behind the lobby is somewhat dated, the rooms are freshly redone and modern. But what really sets it apart is the wonderful and caring and knowledgeable people. We loved our late evenings on the rooftop terrace. We appreciated the guidance and help from the concierge. When we had any question or issue, the staff was there to make sure we were comfortable and happy. 
So, whenever I go to Barcelona again, I will only go to El Palace. Some may be newer and more glitzy but none can beat the care you will experience at this hotel.",5,2016,06,22
29,World Class Hotel!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the El Palace in Barcelona.  The rooms were spectacularly adorned with phenomenal fabrics, accessories, and electronics.  The staff was amazing - extremely knowledgeable, courteous and professional. The breakfast at the hotel is not be missed! Make sure you ask for the ""off the menu"" items.  The french toast, pancakes, etc were amazing.  The hotel is in the PERFECT location for exploring Barcelona by day and night.",5,2016,06,22
29,"Excellent Balance of Quality,Comfort and Service","We decided to stay a few days in Barcelona before heading to Mallorca and am glad we chose El Palace. It was nice to be upgraded to a better room of course,but the public rooms are wonderful which all may enjoy. There is lots of old world charm and opulence to remind one of ""the good old days"" of class and style. All staff were friendly and the 5 star rating is well deserved for this property. Enjoyed the breakfast in the serene breakfast room too  We checked out in a hurry without checking the bill and I later found a charge for a transfer service which we did not use.This was rectified easily with a phone call without fuss or muss. No complaints here..only complements",5,2016,06,22
29,Very luxurious,Loved it here. The staff couldn't do enough for us and made us feel very special. Great location and all of the landmarks really accessible. Lots of shopping and bars in walking distance. Rooftop pool setting was amazing. We will be back!,5,2016,06,21
29,EXCEPTIONAL HOTEL,"We finished a 21 day cruise in Barcelona and arrived at El Palace at 9.30am for a 5 night stay.  To our delight we were immediately escorted to our beautifully appointed large corner room on the 3rd floor, where a bottle of Cava was a very nice welcome.
The excellent service continued throughout our stay, from the warm welcome by Julie to the reception and very helpful concierge staff. 
The Buffet Breakfast had a great selection as well as made to order dishes.  The roof-top pool area with its amazing view was the perfect place to relax after a day of sightseeing.  The Jazz Club was a great spot to finish any evening.
We will happily return to this excellent Hotel in a central location.",5,2016,06,20
29,Loved our stay!,"We had the pleasure of staying at El Palace for four nights on a recent trip to Barcelona and loved every one of them!  The hotel is beautiful and the fact that they still use ""old school"" keys is quite charming. The rooftop pool/lounge area has the best view of the city we experienced outside of the towers of Sagrada Familia. Great location as you can easily walk to Las Ramblas and other areas of town. 

We also had the opportunity to stay at an adjacent hotel for a few nights after extending our stay in Barcelona.  While the other hotel was lovely, we wished we were back at the Palace.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat and miss our evening sangria in the lounge very much!",5,2016,06,19
29,Beautiful hotel,"A beautiful hotel in a central location. Easy walking distance from Las Ramblas and la Plaza Catalunya. Lots of lovely shops nearby. 
Our room was lovely. Breakfast there was lots of choice of fruit and breads also hot dishes with some to order. 
Just had one lunch there in a function room and that was very tasty too. 
There were large lounges to meet up with people and that was handy too.",5,2016,06,18
29,"Fabulous location, excellent service, perfect beds/sleeping, delicious food.","We finished our 2 weeks in Spain by enjoying 4 nights in Barcelona at the El Palace.  What a delight.  The service was excellent on all counts.  The rooms were very, very quiet with double-paned windows so all outdoor noises were contained (even traffic).  Pillows and sheets were of the highest quality and sleeping was just lusciously peaceful.  Dining was easy, good, and delicious, from breakfast in a delightful garden setting, to lunch on the rooftop terrace, to easy room service when the kids didn't feel like going out one more time for dinner!   The decor is very traditional European, which is what we sought.  Many of the hotel offerings in Barcelona are ultra modern and we preferred an older European feel.  Thank you, to all at the El Palace for making our Barcelona visit perfect!",5,2016,06,15
29,"""You Don't Belong Here""","The title of this review is a quote from one of the staff that works at this hotel that was directed to me however the reason for the ""Poor"" rating has to do with something else that I will detail later in this review.

The hotel itself is lovely and ""Grand"" for the lack of a better word. It is a hotel that attempts to overwhelm you with service. Some people like that, others do not. I am the latter.

For me, after flying to a new city and arriving at a hotel, what I want to do is get to my room as quickly as possible, change (sometimes have a shower) and get out and about as quickly as possible. With the Grand Hotel, I knew I would have to be strategic and I asked the taxi driver to drop us next door at the Cotton Store Hotel, which is less than a one minute walk from the Grand, as I knew that as soon as a taxi driver turned up their porters would be all over us trying to get our bags off of us. I was indeed right. Sure, they are doing their jobs but I did not want to relinquish our bags as I was interested in having a shower after checking in and it isn't too difficult to carry your own when you have minimal baggage. Nothing annoys me more than the porters taking your bags and then turning up sometime after you have entered the room and then expect a tip for it.

Check-in was relatively painless. The concierge then started talking about all of the hotel facilities after the porters tried to take our bags from us again, pointing out where the bar was, the dining room is, how to get into the terrace, etc. He was pleasant and cheerful. I advised him that we didn't need an escort to our room as I am sure that it could be easily found (amazing what a University degree can do for you) and as mentioned, I wanted a shower and to visit the toilet so I didn't need someone pointout out where the television was and where the bed was since I wasn't checking into Downton Abbey. Again, some people like this level of service, but for me a ""no thank you"" should suffice.

Now I am probably making this review long and detailed since I am annoyed with the hotel on another matter, so hang in there.

The room was good. I liked the big walk in closet so dirty clothes could be hidden along with bags. The bathroom was well presented with many large soft towels which were welcomed. A warm shower was had and the facilities were comfortable. The hair dryer didn't work. No big deal really. I went to look for an ironing board and iron, but I discovered there isn't one. I looked at the price list for the hotel to do the ironing and I was shocked to see that they wanted 13 Euros to iron a shirt. I decided to not bother and we went out in Barcelona for good food and drink in the local restaurants and bars.

One odd thing I found about the room is that it is presented with white unironed serviettes on the floor next to the bed with pairs of slippers still in plastic wrap sitting on them. The serviette looks like it belongs in the restaurant with the creases. Some people I am sure would find this quaint but I found it annoying as it just was additional clutter in the room and insinuated that the carpet within the small room was dirty and that you should wear some disposable slippers. In fact the unironed servietters on the floor looked really tacky and they ended up being thrown in the bathtub out of the way.

Clutter is a big thing. The desk is unusable until you move things around because of the coffee cups, kettle, the hotel FAQ book, all sorts of other propoganda (including on the side tables) which is annoying. There was an available power port for a laptop on the desk without unplugging anything and the same was the case under the bedside tables. I am so used to unplugging lamps to get power for the phone charger that the powerpoints being available actually surprised me.

Now the big issue that I have with the hotel is this. After returning from a very long day exploring Barcelona by foot, we retired to the cocktail bar for some beverages. It was only like 7:00 PM and we were the only ones in there so we were placed at the only table that was not ""reserved"" for the forthcoming nightly entertainment, which was fair enough. After enjoying a beverage in this bar, which I thought was a relaxed place with cheerful people, we made our way to the lobby and then started walking up the stairs when concierge started shouting at us ""You don't belong here!"" and at first I had no idea who he was speaking to and then after it was repeated I had words back and waved around my key. Without interpretting what this conceirge meant is just speculation as it could have meant a range of things, so I will just assume that he thought we were coming in off the street and breaching hotel security and I will leave it at that.

So when I got back to the room, I rang the front desk and asked for the duty manager. At first I was told the duty manager was not available and the person on the other line offered to help. I then again asked for the duty manager as I was relatively annoyed and irritated about my exchange with the conceirge. After asking for the duty manager at least ten times and being told that this person was not there, I finally got them to tell me the name of the duty manager after they put me on hold for a while, to which I hung up and called back and started the process of asking the same question over and over again. Now, I am not so annoyed about being shouted at by the conceirge, but the fact that a supposed 5-star hotel that prides itself on service and guest satisfaction did not have a duty manager working on a Saturday night at 8:00 PM. After that I moved all of the unused coffee cups and other clutter on the desk and set up my laptop (thus noticing the powerpoint for the first time) and wrote an e-mail about my experience and sent it to the hotel's generic e-mail address. That was 72 hours ago, so I gave them the opportunity to respond and they never did. When I attempted to contact the duty manager the next day using the name that I was told has that role, the front desk never had heard of this person. So why I rate this hotel poorly is the fact that there is no escalation point for an issue, and I find that extremely poor.

Would I stay there again? No way. After forking out 1500 Euros for three nights, I at least expected a manager to speak with and not countless porters that want to take your bags from you (both on arrival and leaving) as that just seems like an obvious thing that a 5-star hotel would have.",2,2016,06,15

29,Fantastic Historic Hotel,"When you walk into the Palace Hotel, your first thought might be ""This looks like the Ritz.""  Perhaps that's because it was built by Caesar Ritz in 1919 and operated under his name until 1992.  Never mind the change of name and owner, because the spirit of Caesar Ritz lives on.  Everything about this hotel is first class: the rooms and suites, the service (the doorman remembers your name), the food.  The prices are high but worth every penny.  If you long for old-world elegance, the Palace truly is one.",5,2016,06,07

29,Wonderful Stay!,"Very much enjoyed our stat at El Palace Hotel. Highly recommended and hope to return. 

Friendly and accommodating staff.  No request seemed inconvenient; everyone went out of their way to improve our stay. 

Location is great. Lots of delicious restaurants within easy walking distance.  Short walk to Plaza Catalunya and other sites. Easy to get a cab for longer distances. 

Spacious and clean rooms.  Each was well-adorned. Nice toiletries and plush towels.  Service staff did a great job.  

Breakfast was a delicious spanish spread with an interesting asian highlight.  I enjoyed it very much.  The bar makes great cocktails, and the downstairs cocktail bar is a lot of fun.  Never made it to the roof. 

Fitness center is small with enough equipment for a light workout.  But don't expect a full gym. Was also very hot in the fitness center, and there wasn't anyone around to fix that.  Odd. 

Wifi speed is, of course, bad.  But i have said that in every review for every european hotel i've ever written.  My expectations are likely too high.",5,2016,05,29
29,"Nice property, good location, service could be better","My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights while in town for the Adele concert.  I enjoyed the aesthetics of the hotel as well as the attractive location, just a short walk to La Rambla and many of the sites located within the Gothic Quarter. I was a bit put off by some of the service aspects, however. Usually would not be a big deal but when staying at a ""5 star"" property it is worth noting.
My husband and I realized while en route to Barcelona that we had neglected to set up car service from the airport. We called the hotel and attempted to arrange this over the phone, however, we were informed that this needed to be done via email. That is, the service attendant REFUSED to do it over the phone. My husband emailed the concierge during our layover in Frankfurt and never received a reply back. When we arrived at the airport in Barcelona we passed by the area where several drivers were holding up signs for their clients. We looked around and did not see any sign with our name on it, so we took a cab to the hotel. Not a big deal; our fault for giving late notice. The frustrating part was when we received a call to our hotel room after our arrival berating us for leaving the airport as our driver was supposedly waiting for us. I explained that there was no one there when we arrived and rather than accepting my statement and apologizing (which would have been appropriate customer service at a 5 star hotel IMO) the attendant continued to harp on the fact that the driver was there and we should not have left the airport. 
I have stayed at other nice hotels while traveling abroad and they make an effort to know what language you speak and answer calls (for room service, etc) in English. No effort to do that at this establishment and it was apparent that the concierges did not always have full understanding of our conversations.
Another issue, the concierge set up a private tour for us with the quoted price of 220 euros. When it came time to pay, the guide told us it cost 290. We were happy to pay him as he did a good job, however, the hotel neglected to admit that they had made an error, even after the guide insisted on calling the concierge desk.
Housekeeping missed turndown service one evening for no apparent reason. We were out of the hotel for several hours and then they just never came by.
I recognize that these are all very small details, but they are important when you're staying at a five-star resort and expect a certain degree of service. This place missed the mark. ",4,2016,05,29
29,Fantastic hotel within walking distance to most major attractions within the city. Staff is extraordinary.,"Fantastic hotel within walking distance to most major attractions within the city of Barcelona. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious, quiet and filled with amenities. The staff is extraordinary and within a very short time learned our names and seemed to anticipate our needs. Didn't get to try the spa or rooftop pool as we were so busy with exploring the city. Will definitely be back to Barcelona and will absolutely stay at El Palace",5,2016,05,24
29,Awesome time in El Palace,"A lovely hotel in a great location, easy to walk to many of Barcelona's great attractions. The hotel staff could not do enough for you from restaurants 19 to the cocktail bar. Managed to get to the new roof terrace, you have to visit with wonderful shaded areas, pool, sun beds and bar with 360 views awesome. 
",5,2016,05,22
29,Wonderful stay,The hotel is beautiful and the interior is gorgeous. The service was a bit tricky since the staff for room service didn't speak any English but they were very friendly. The breakfast room is great with a sun roof and very delicious. Also the location was smack in the middle of great locations (walking distance to the big shops) I would definitely recommend it! ,4,2016,05,18
29,Fabulous Hotel in the heart of Barcelona ,"This hotel has to be one of the most luxurious hotels we've stayed in. 
It is truly opulent.
The bedrooms were magnificent, and almost soundproofed; with high ceilings, plenty of space and all the facilities you would expect. We loved the bathroom with its huge 'rain-shower' shower head.
The rooftop pool area was a lovely tranquil place to escape from the city after sightseeing. 
In terms of location, the hotel is only a short walk to many of the sights - and close to the underground system. There's a taxi rank just outside if needed.
The food in the bar area, and at breakfast, was delicious! and we particularly liked the small ""snug"" jazz club to finish off our evenings.

Perhaps the best things about this hotel are the incredibly helpful staff; and the fine furnishings, large rooms and high ceilings giving a sense of spaciousness and quiet tranquility throughout  - a true palace in the heart of Barcelona! 
",5,2016,05,18
29,Bad temper,"I stayed there one night .
it was beautiful but I will never choose that hotel again
they checked in too late because they didn't prepared the rooms on time .
Also I lost my iphone in the lobby but they didn't even use their CCTV to show me what has happened for my iphone . very very bad temper .",2,2016,05,17
29,Fabulous weekend,"Fabulous room, fabulous service, fabulous location. I couldn't fault it. Concierges went out of their way to help. We were allowed to check in early after an early morning flight. Jazz club in the basement. Stunning.",5,2016,05,17
29,Barcelona Gem,"Within easy walking of the old town, this is a gem.  The service is excellent, Internet great, the food is very fine.  And don't miss the rooftop open air dining, particularly for breakfast, a quick swim, and the views.",5,2016,05,15
29,"Gorgeous Hotel, Extraordinary Staff",Fantastic location - easy walking distance to most attractions. Beautiful dining areas and lounges - extremely elegant.  Rooms lovely and well equipped.  Beds really comfortable.  Great breakfast buffet selection with hot food cooked to order.  Staff - they really are superb.  Very attentive without being intrusive.  Top notch.  Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it if you are visiting Barcelona.,5,2016,05,12
29,Top notch Five Star hotel,"This is an old style hotel which used to be the Ritz. It is well preserved and a top notch hotel, in a great location. The hotel is a part of the Leading Hotels of the world and is one of the best members of this affiliation we've stayed at.
Breakfast is excellent. There is an outdoor pool on the roof. We had a junior suite which was great, but the sleeping room was large on its own.
I was very impressed with the Concierge' service - both quality, attitude and the fact that two of them were always present. They remembered us immediately after the first time we used them, and there is nothing special about us.",5,2016,05,10
29,Five Star All The Way,"Just spent 4 nights first time in Barcelona. This hotel is a five star in all aspects but what makes this hotel a true five star is the staff especially a Jem by the name of Julie. If you are lucky to meet her your vacation will be much enhanced. From restaurants, show tickets, tours whatever you need she has the information you will need. Extremely helpful.  The Hotel is beautiful and will not disappoint you. The Hotel is built in the shape of a U the Junior Suites are all on the inside of the U facing other rooms. I would recommend requesting outer rooms to have a view of the city and street below. Would recommend and stay at EL Palace again.",5,2016,05,09
29,Rich old hotel,"Very good hotel with nice room numbers and absolutely great location.
Breakfasts were very tasty with rich choice of food and pleasant staff and not more expensive than in cafes nearby.
For dinner you have 3 options: Caelis with Michelin star, nineteen, and typical bar with music and snacks.
Two things want to mention that disappoint me:
1) my stolen cosmetics from room number.
2) feather pillows instead of my allergy.
It was absolutely unacceptable ",4,2016,05,06
29,Wonderful Hotel,It's wonderful hotel. Everything is OK. Breakfast is good. But it was one thing. The 1 of May was my birthday but I didn't get any congratulations from hotel. It's a PITY! Is it a FIVE star hotel?????,5,2016,05,05
29,Luxury from start to finish ,"From the minute we arrived at El Palace we were treated like royalty , nothing was to much trouble. The hotel is beautifully furnished , very luxurious yet comfortable . 
Our bedroom was super , very comfortable super king size bed, with an open fire ( not lit as weather was warm ) . The bathroom was a joy to use with large shower and 2 different shower heads, a  small but very adequate bath and lovely loccitaine samples to use. Beds were folded down at night with chocolates and new slippers and bottled water replaced daily .

Breakfast held in a separate area was so good . The choice was vast it was hard to choose what to take. We even had glasses of cava with breakfast , this has to be a first ! 

The barman was excellent, recommending a Spanish Gin called Nordes which was so smooth a lovely drink . He was pleasant and friendly during the evening and came to speak to us again the following morning . 
The hotel has a lovely roof terrace , be aware this closes at 6 pm every day . The view across the city is superb and a bar , swimming pool , sun loungers and seating areas are available. 

I really cannot speak more highly of this hotel it was a real treat to stay and I hope to return . ",5,2016,04,28
29,Absolutely beautiful!,"My husband and I have just returned from a long weekend staying at El Palace. It is absolutely stunning!. We did not want for anything or lift a finger from the moment our taxi pulled up outside, the staff are amazing!. The room was a great size and decorated beautifully.",5,2016,04,25
29,Perfect Stay!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights as a short break during the Easter Holiday.  What a beautiful hotel.  The service by every single member of staff was excellent.  From the time we stepped out of the taxi to the time we got back in it to return to the airport the staff could not have done more to make our stay just perfect.  The room was luxurious and kept spotlessly clean.  One evening we were very tired from our day of visiting all the wonderful attractions that Barcelona has to offer so we ordered room service, it was set up on an extra table in our room with flowers and even though it was quite late at night when we ordered it the food was perfectly cooked and presented.  I cannot speak highly enough of the staff and this hotel - cannot wait to return for another stay - it is of course a little expensive but so worth it.",5,2016,04,25
29,A 5 star start for the honeymoon ,"As a first timer in Barcelona, I was afraid that I might not find a luxury hotel.

El Palace Hotel is that and more. The location itself is amazing and we could easily reach all the sights of Barcelona, The staff is friendly and English speaking, and the lobby is ... wow. 

A classy Hotel for a classy start  ",5,2016,04,24
29,Excellent 5* Hotel in Barcelona,"We went to Barcelona for a 6 day break during the first week of April. It was my first time in Barcelona and we were looking forward very much to our trip. Unfortunately even before we got out from the taxi from the airport at the front of the hotel we were robbed by a scooter gang and we lost everything. We lost a lot of valuables and all our holiday cash. It was absolutely traumatising and devasting thing to have happen at the start of your holiday.

However the staff at El Palace did an excellent job in making sure we were looked after and OK after such an ordeal. The front desk to the management to the ladies who worked at guest relations were all attentive and excellent. They helped us get in touch with the police and the British embassy to help replace my stolen passport as well as getting in touch with my family to inform them I'm ok. The service we received was personal and excellent and I cannot compliment the staff enough. It made what happened bearable and did not ruin the rest of our holiday.

The hotel itself is pure luxury and beautiful and decorated in a classical and tasteful way. We loved the style and really enjoyed our stay. If we ever return to Barcelona (once we get over the trauma of what happened!) we will definitely return to this hotel again. Our room was lovely and we received complimentary cava and chocolates from the hotel to provide us with some comfort of what happened. These things were really appreciated.

Our tip would be to make sure the taxi you get the airport pulls you up to the front entrance of the hotel and not on the corner or the side. It is possible our taxi driver was working with the scooter robbers to deliberately drop us off at an out of the way place away from cctvs, also don't take all your valuables with you from the airport in one bag as Barcelona, although a stunning city, is infamous for robberies and pickpockets which we only discovered too late,",5,2016,04,23
29,Vintage hotel,"Our fondness for the hotel grew by the day over the 5 days we stayed there. 
To be honest, our first impressions were not great. It felt old and dated when we first checked in, this may be partly because we just stayed at the ultra modern 'Only You"" boutique hotel in Madrid. 
Then we realised the history and the fact that it is a 100 year old hotel. We slowly started understanding the specialness of the hotel.

The service was impeccable. 
The lobby was spectacular.
We had breakfast in the garden room and it is an experience to cherish.
The bar downstairs is like an old jazz club and had great atmosphere. We enjoyed it a lot.

A couple of minor annoyances which can readily be fixed without any cost. The towel hook was loose and wobbly. On close examination, the screws were cheap replacement screws on a vintage hook and they were ill fitting and loose. Same thing with plug holders. They were cheap plastic and loose.
Finally, the bathroom fixture on the tub was fitted sloppily and misaligned with the wall tiles and the rest of the fixtures. I was reminded of my own plumbing skills. These simple things should not happen in any decent hotel, surely not in a hotel of this calibre. Undoubtedly these added to our first impressions of it being dated.

Overall, we liked it a lot and would recommend staying there.",5,2016,04,23
29,Wife 60th birthday treat.,"Fantastic hotel in a central location. Journey from airport to hotel is only 20 minutes. The staff are very friendly and always wiling to hep. The classic deluxe room is very spacious with separate dressing area, walk in shower and separate toilet facilities. You will love the breakfast first class service.
The hotel is within easy walking distance for sightseeing, restaurant, cafe and designer shopping. The Picasso museum is well work seeing.",5,2016,04,22
29,Grand Prix stay,"Stayed here for a couple of nights for the Grand Prix. Top class facilities in a great location. Very competent staff. Rooms are large and a great balcony to watch the bustle of life going by. Breakfast on the terrace is a great way to start the day. 
I enjoyed the Bluesman bar at night, good wine and cocktails. Plus for me is the live jazz. 
Location is good. 5 mins walk to La Ramblas
Wifi could do with upgrading as it was very slow. ",5,2016,04,16
29,Very nice,"Really good place. Beautiful old style hotel, good service, good bar, live music. I had a lot of fun. I can t say nothing bad. Everything was perfect. I   hope i will come back soon to this beautiful hotel. ",5,2016,04,12
29,Friends 50th birthday treat,I booked myself and 4 friends here for afternoon tea. It was absolutely amazing. Very posh interior and the staff were so attentive. Kept coming over to top up our sandwiches etc and giving us fresh tea. If you enjoy an afternoon tea then book here for a special treat if you are ever in Barcelona.,5,2016,04,12
29,Royal Elegance,"I could go on and on!! Let's just say every positive, five star review given to El Palace  is exactly how we felt about this absolutely  beautiful hotel!  The service is impeccable. The lobby is incredible. The breakfast atrium is Gorgeous! It reminds me of a beautiful New Orleans courtyard, but on a much more grand, romantic scale.  The rooms are very large. Bathrooms have both a tub and shower stocked with luxury bath products. There was a large, spacious closet.  We had a room with a balcony overlooking Sagrada Familia. What a beautiful view out of the window! We also enjoyed late night cocktails and live jazz in the downstairs bar that was very nicely decorated. I would stay at this hotel at every opportunity. You will feel like royalty.",5,2016,04,11
29,Excellence,Excellent and beautiful hotel providing top class facilities and amenities plus superior services from everybody. Perfect location and fair price. All employees are constantly ensuring that you are satisfied. Thanks to everybody at El Palace hotel.,5,2016,04,11
29,The Best Hotel in Spain,"My family stayed in many luxury 5 star hotels in the world and in Spain. This was our most favorite hotel in Spain. The luxury, service, and opulence of the old luxurious world, seamlessly merged with the utmost modern technology that we saw at El Palace is the best combination we have encountered of the places we have stayed in over the years. The location was great. The service was excellent. The breakfast was superb. The rooms with modern technology are great, also super comfortable, with 6 or 7 choices of pillows. This one is sooooo much better than the Ritz of Madrid, for example. We did not want to leave.",5,2016,04,06
29,Excellent in every way!,El Palace is a beautiful hotel run by an exceptional staff.  Everything is kept immaculately.  The staff is extremely competent and friendly.  They go out of their way to assist you in every way possible.  There is not a question the concierges will not go out of their way to answer.  Morning breakfast on The Terrace is filled with every kind of item one could desire.  The rooms are lovely.  Our television was located in the mirror.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The hotel is the former Ritz and it continues to maintain the standards one expects from that hotel.  We had a lovely stay and we would definitely return there whenever we are in Barcelona.,5,2016,04,04
29,Special Hotel,"Superb hotel with first class facilities. Excellent location for sightseeing and all major Barcelona attractions. The only thing lacking was atmosphere, as seemed very few staying at the hotel. We would definitely stay again if we could get the same brilliant discounted offer.",5,2016,04,02
29,"Wonderful hotel, luxurious and friendly experience","From the moment we stepped up to the door on arrival to the moment we left, this hotel was superlative.  The atmosphere is plush and traditional but not stuffy or old fashioned.  Beautiful style and outstanding service - at every moment, all the time.  The whole hotel is beautifully maintained, retaining elements of art deco and reminding one of an old world luxury that is missing in many hotels today. The location is excellent also, walking distance to many places and short (very affordable) taxi hops to the others.

Our room (212) was ""standard"" but would clearly be superior in many hotels. Very comfortable bed and every convenience we could have wanted including a very modern bathroom with huge shower and a bath and two sinks.  Lots of wardrobe space and hangars, a pillow menu, mini bar and a small balcony from where we could see the bustle of Barcelona life.  Good wifi.

The lounge and bar area are comfortable and the service is outstanding, lovely drinks available and breakfast in the terrace area is just wonderful.  We had dinner at Caelis which was a great experience and spent a very enjoyable evening drinking cocktails and listening to live music in the Bluesman bar.  We also used the spa which although small is lovely and we had excellent facials.

Overall I cannot rate it any more highly and thanks in no small way to the wonderful, genuinely friendly, professional and meticulous staff we had an excellent stay.",5,2016,04,02
29,Wonderful experience,"This is a beautiful hotel, well appointed, with a very convenient  location and fabulous service. No details were overlooked. Concierge and other hotel staff were very friendly and tremendously helpful. The rooms were lovely and comfortable. We would absolutely return to El Palace. ",5,2016,03,31
29,Fab hotel - will stay again!,"not cheap, actually it's on the pricey side but we know that before booking.  of course, with the rate we paid, we expect good things and boy did we get good things.  the staff are so helpful. thumbs up!
breakfast is a good spread - good variety with dim sum items. fizzy are also available and i see some tables making good use of this - and why not?  it's part of the bill!
there is a nice, small bar downstairs where live music is played on weekends.  nice place to chill.
we also ate at the michelin star restaurant in the hotel - faultless is all i can say!
love this hotel - i will come back for sure.",5,2016,03,25
29,Lovely Hotel,"Great Hotel (former Ritz) with stunning interior/decoration, old-school customer service and tasty breakfast offerings. Michelin-star restaurant Caelis is worth a visit. Perfectly located at the heart of Barcelona, close to catalunya place.",5,2016,03,20
29,A Touch of Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"Checked into El Palace Hotel this week, what a lovely Hotel! Pure indulgence as soon as you enter the swing doors. 
The staff on reception always have the time for you & the 24 hour concierge are really helpful as to where to go for just about anything! They recommended some lovely restaurants to us.
Taxi stand just across the road where there are always taxis readily available.
Stayed in room 509 which was lovely.
This is at the front of the Hotel, right in the heart of Barcelona, can be noisy if you are looking for a ""quiet"" room.  A Roman bath in the bathroom, with all the luxuries you would expect in a 5* Hotel. The service was excellent and the staff can not do enough for you. Room service is fast & efficient as is the service in the restaurant and at Breakfast.  Breakfast s a wonderful affair with just about everything on the buffet. 
The Hotel has a wonderful fragrance running through it and creates a lovely ambience. The ""main"" bar which is situated on the ground floor closes at midnight, but there is a wonderful bar downstairs which is open until 2am that plays some lovely jazz music. (live music once a week) really cosy bar you find hard to leave. In fact, the Hotel is pretty hard to leave!",5,2016,03,18
29,Amazing Hotel - worth it!,"My family and I came to Barcelona to watch Arsenal and stayed in this amazing hotel. The hotel room was rather small (2nd floor) but the bathroom made up for it. The room included everything you could imagine - maybe that is why it felt a bit squashed. 

The hotel member of staff were always helpful and professional. Whatever you needed, you could go and ask for it. They always had a smile in their faces - great service!

The hotel gave us some restaurant recommondations and they never disappointed us. 

Breakfast in the morning was absolutely amazing. We all have a different taste and we all were satisfied and happy after breakfast. The only con: The coffe and orange juice we ordered took a little bit too long for our liking.

All in all: This is the place to go when you want to spoil yourself. We will come back ! ",5,2016,03,17
29,Wonderful stay!,"From the moment we checked in, our stay was wonderful. The service staff is great and everyone spoke English which was extremely helpful as I only speak a bit of Spanish. On our first night the concierge was helpful in getting us a reservation at a nearby restaurant. The location is also great as it is just outside of the old city and probably a five minute walk to La Rambla. We walked everywhere we went and saw such beautiful architecture. We would stay here again if we decide to return to Barcelona.",5,2016,03,17
29,A wonderful stay,"We stayed four nights at this wonderful hotel and enjoyed every minute. It is at a perfect location for visiting Barcelona; the old city, the shopping mile, many of the museums and sights are within walking distance. It is a hotel with charm, with excellent service and with large, nicely modernized rooms. The breakfast is sumptuous. The staff is friendly and helpful. We will be back!",4,2016,03,16
29,Excellent stay,We were greeted upon arrival by a very professional but very friendly concierge who showed us the hotel. Luxury and tradition are the key words. Elegant lounge furnished very nicely with over stuffed couches and chairs. Beautiful rooms with walk-in closet and very large bathrooms. Excellent service on every occasion.,5,2016,03,16
29,Very good,Stayed three nights at this nice hotel with good location in Barcelona. Very nice room with modern bathroom. We enjoyed the sumptuous public areas and all the staff were excellent with good recommendations for restaurants etc.,4,2016,03,13
29,Beautiful stay,"Just returned from a 2 nights stay at this beautiful hotel. From the moment we stepped in the hotel everything went smoothly. Even though we arrived pretty early our room was ready, everyone was so helpful when we asked about the tourists attractions. The room was good size with all amenities, can't fault it. The cocktail bar downstairs is a small and cozy area , there was also a jazz band playing when we were there . The breakfast was buffet style with lots to chose from... Everywhere in the hotel the staff was very polite and friendly. We will definitely be back when in Barcelona next time. Massive thanks again El Palace ...",5,2016,03,09
29,"Good location, great accommodation ....","very nice hotel with great concierge team who helped us plan our stay in Barcelona. Bedroom was spacious, comfortable and clean. Bathroom was good size but badly designed as loo was in bathroom behind a door that then knocked into main door of bathroom and bath was tiny .. .but nice shower and sink area. nice toiletries, bathrobes etc.. Hotel lobby and seating area and all decor very oldy worldy .. but tasteful with charm! Found breakfast very expensive so did not opt for this and was very glad i had not payed this because when you go out the front door and turn left on the other side of the road .. 1 min walk! amazing coffee shop called Art Del Pa ... fresh fruit juice, range of most amazing breads and pastries and good coffee .. you could either eat in or take away and breakfast for 2 of us with 2 coffees each, fruit juices and pastries cost Euro 12 for both .. clean, friendly service and lovely pastries ..",4,2016,03,05
29,MADE TO FEEL LIKE ROYALTY,"We stayed at the hotel last weekend, and what a fantastic time. The staff and atmosphere were superb. We had a massage at the Mayen Spa which was fantastic, we had breakfast, we had dinner, we had drinks in the bar downstairs listening to the live band Reckless, the manager even played a set then took time out to have a chat with us. What more can I say!! This is the only place we shall ever say in when we come back to Barcelona!!",5,2016,03,02
29,"Best location, best staff, great experience",The hotel is well located in the middle of Barcelona. Very close to all attractions. The staff are just great and very helpful.

29,Fantastic and stunning hotel,"Staff so friendly and provided a wonderful service. The food in the fine dining restaurant was out of this world.  Our bedroom was magnificent and miss it; loved the bathroom.

29,BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD!!!,"If ever you've wanted to live and be treated like royalty... This hotel makes that happen... From the moment the valet opens your vehicle door, until the porter lets you into your room... REAL ROYALTY! The doorman greets you with an authentic Spanish hello... Check in is a breeze and the decor and design of the hotel is like something from a historical documentary... So authentic... So classy and elegant. The service is impeccable and the room is fit for a king! The bathroom? Words cannot actually describe it... It would be a crime to be in Barcelona and NOT stay in this hotel!!!",5,2016,02,28
29,Great hotel ,"Palatial entrance and decor. Booked it through BA holidays. 
Went for basic room and breakfast but room and bathroom of v high standard. 

Breakfast room and food is superb so advise to get a room with breakfast included. Very good staff. 

Lovely hotel to have as a base for a city break. ",5,2016,02,21
29,Relaxing Business,"My wife had to be in Barcelona for a quick business trip, and was booked in the Palace.
While she was in meetings, the staff treated me as family.  They anticipated my needs, directed me to various sites, and couldn't have been more helpful.
The included breakfast was outstanding....a huge variety of food, juice, pastries, etc. provided a good start for the day.  There is also a Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel, but I did not dine there.
Our room was spacious, very modern, and had a great view of the city.
When was the last time you had a real room ""key""?  All the rooms have keyed locks, and you leave the key with the concierge when out....nice touch !
This hotel personifies ""old world"" grandeur  with 21st century efficiency in the heart of Barcelona.",5,2016,02,16
29,Excellent hotel!,"Very good location; great decor and ambience in a classic style.  Friendly service.
Clean rooms, as in photos.  Very comfortable bed and pillows.  Rooms very quiet.  Concierge attentive and helpful. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay.",5,2016,02,14
29,This is exactly palace,"I went to Spain for a short vacation and stayed for 9 nights in this nice hotel in Barcelona, the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the concierge is also helpful and I really recommend to contact the concierge if you would like to do some tourism activities or to go for shopping,or if you want to see football matches,..etc 
The hotel serves the breakfast daily from 8 to 11 am, the hotel interior design and rooms are amazing.
The hotel is located in the center where the shops and restaurants are nearby.
The best surprise I had is that my room was ready when I checked in at the hotel at 8 AM, and I would like to say that room service is 24 hrs and room is always, at the end this hotel will really take care of you.",5,2016,02,09
29,Sheer perfection :-),"Despite its stunning interior and luxurious service, the staff of this hotel are still down to earth and do their absolute upmost to make you feel comfortable without any air of arrogance. I booked three nights at El Palace for my boyfriends 30th birthday, it did not disappoint. Julie (huge shout out to her) and her team helped me so much in the run up and during our stay to make it perfect. From bubbles on arrival to birthday cake at breakfast, to serving my personalised champagne as a surprise on the morning of my boyfriends birthday. The breakfast was amazing and the room opulent. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere special yet central in Barcelona. Walking distance from La Rambla but far enough away to not feel too touristy. Thank you so much Julie for going to so much effort, sorry it has taken me so long to write the review! Would love to return :-)",5,2016,02,08
29,Exquisite,"This hotel is absolutely stunning, not only the arquitecture and decoration, which is just overwhealming, but also for its sensational stuff. The guest relations are lovely and very usefull, and all the rest of the team seems to be there to make your life easier. Really clean rooms and a very charm palace (literally) in the middle of the city.
100% recomendable, I will definetely come back.",5,2016,02,08
29,Gorgeous!,"We stayed here for a special trip in May 2015. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Simply lovely.

29,50th Birthday with girls (2nd visit),"Two years ago we had the privilege of being in this hotel/spa/Restaurant. Do you go back 2 years later. Yes we did for my 50th birthday were we disappointed NO. Hotel was just as good just as fantastic with quality and service, nice to see the same staff who remembered us for all the good. Better service and spent less time finding all the shops etc in Barcelona as we had been before. Would I go back? already planning my next visit for 2017. having everything in one hotel is the advantage from  spa. to Mitchlin restaurant to live entertainment/music to afternoon tea, to breakfast, and doing nothing but room service in your pyjamas, what more do you want after shopping and the treats of Barcelona. Swimming pool and roof terrace we might have to do an additional visit n the summer. Value for money. Worth every penny spent. Thank you everyone in Hotel Palace for everything you do.",5,2016,01,29
29,Everything perfect...,"I spent 3 nights at the el Palace hotel Barcelona with my wife and daughter. It was truly a great experience. First of all, I am really grateful to the reception because they upgraded our room to a junior suite room upon our arrival. We had a very warm welcome by Javier who was from the hotel concierge staff. The room was very clean, quite large and a big bathroom with jacuzi and a separate shower. Housekeeping did a great job too, to clean up the room.
My wife and daughter did have breakfast and they said it was much more than a satisfactory breakfast. I am not hungry in the mornings so I never eat breakfast. The staff at the hotel are all very polite and helpful. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to have a real palace like experience and be treated like royals...",5,2016,01,27
29,Deluxe,"My husband and I build a splurge hotel into nearly every trip we take and El Palace was our splurge at the end of a 2-week vacation in Spain.  The staff treat you like royalty and everything you need or want is right there.  We had two delicious meals in the hotel restaurant.  Breakfast is served on a large veranda decked out in gorgeous black and white fair.  The decor in no way distracts from the remarkable selection of food which was heavenly.  Our room was very large, comfortable and quiet, and the lighting in the bathroom was perfect.  We had a most enjoyable stay.",5,2016,01,23
29,Personal and high quality food,"Central location within walking distance of main shopping streets. 10 minutes to the harbour. Personal and speedy service. Breakfast and lunch is the highest level I ever experienced, comparing to other 5 star hotels. The hotel style well reflected at the home page, so don't go if you like modern style. Roof terrace unfortunately closed for renovation, so you cannot enjoy the sun at the moment. I would go again with my wife to a weekend trip, but not with my kids.",5,2016,01,23
29,Luxury,"Everything is perfect.
In the center of Barcelona, a very quick step from historic city.
Room are very quiet.
Nineteen is the restaurant we recommend in this hotel.
Caelis is too expensive for the level of one star Michelin.",5,2016,01,23
29,Love it!!,"This was my birthday Trip and My bf booked the Suite here El palace. The Lobby is immaculate.  Service is excellent, Front desk well helped. Location is good as well. Definitely had wonderful time here!! ",5,2016,01,23
29,An unusual introduction to El Palace. ,"We were trying to take our 4 large bags to a hotel down the street from the Palace. Our taxi driver dropped us at the wrong location and merrily sped off, leaving us stranded, trying to cross a major boulevard, busy with traffic, still not even sure where our hotel was located. 

El Palace doorman, Sr. David, sprang into action. Grabbing our luggage and guiding us to our hotel down the block (ie. Not his hotel). I can't tell you what a great impression his kindness and professionalism made on us. 

I will be certain to stay at El Palace on my next visit to Barcelona. It is very nice to find someone with pride in his city and his job, to help some visiting strangers in this way. 

Thanks again, David, and thanks to the Palace for having such wonderful staff!",5,2016,01,21
29,Come for the old sophisticated touch,"My wife and me came to Barcelona to celebrate the New Year and what a treat El Palace was for us.

Our pleasure started at the entrance as we received a very warm welcome by both the bell man and the reception.  While the hotel was quite busy, reception have us attention and provided us with a very nice room selection.

The price is certainly great compared with London, but it's not economical for sure.  We were still happy about value for money.

The hotel reports that a full renovation was made in 2009.  We do believe this is true, and they succeeded in preserving the old sophisticated ambience. 

Breakfast is in a converted garden area that is so cute and memorable.  The buffet selection was fair with nice local cuisine.

Perhaps the nicest aspect of the hotel is the friendly service provided whenever we asked for something.

We will surely be coming back again to this grand hotel.

29,wonderful hotel with walking distance of the older part of Barcelona and the Gaudi Houses,"This is the type of hotel you book hoping for the best and heave a sigh of relief when you walk in the door of your room.  wonderfully attentive service, lovely big room and bathrooms that are very nice.   Its on the Gran Via about 3 blocks from Plaza Catalunya so you can walk to the plaza to catch the tour busses and hop across the plaza to get to the beginning of Las Ramblas street. Its not on the main drag (las ramblas) which I found nice but if you want to walk out your door into instant people watching this isn't the hotel for you. Staff is fluent in English (the doorman is an American from a suburb of Pittsburgh so no problem with directions etc). its also an easy walk to the Guadi Houses      One day we came back to find out rooms were not made up during the day.   We left for coffee and on our return we had a bottle of champagne and some chocolates with a nice apology from the manager.  Very nice touch!   we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but the restaurant looked great. All in all a great place to spend our honeymoon!",5,2015,12,31
29,Fantastic!,"In Barcelona for a 5 day Christmas City break and stayed at the Palace. What a perfect choice! Not only it's location, but the the staff, the service, the comfort of the rooms and the 'old feel' atmosphere made it a family Christmas to remember.",5,2015,12,31
29,Old style sophistication,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Apart from the spectacular interior and convenient location, what makes this place so special, is the staff: professional, friendly and so prepared to go out of their way for you.",5,2015,12,23
29,Amazing hotel,"Oh, we love this place.  Old world luxury coupled with modern amenities.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was spacious and lovely.  Breakfast was spectacular.  The public areas are worthy of a castle.  Located a short walk from the main shopping area, with plenty of nearby, good restaurants.  The concierge were fabulous.  Will stay here again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2015,12,15
29,"Elegant ""Old World"" Hotel","This Hotel offers the excellent service expected of a five star Leading Hotel of the World. They employ a young lady Concierge who was absolutely wonderful and helped us organise our days very efficiently. The Restaurant for breakfast was staffed very well, nothing was too much trouble and the food was of a very high standard. We thought Restaurant 19 had a menu which was not really suitable for an informal relaxed restaurant, difficult if one required more of a snack, and it was quite pricey. Our bedroom Deluxe Classic unfortunately smelt very stale, it required more ventilation which I do realise would be difficult, for as soon as the windows were opened, the road noise flooded in. This Hotel is in a brilliant central location and taxis are just outside the door.",5,2015,12,15
29,Service sets it apart from others,"I cant speak highly enough of all the staff at the property- everyone was professional, friendly, helpful and there when you needed.  Rooms are typical for European hotels so they will be small for Americans- very comfortably furnished with modern bathrooms- the place has the feeling of a great grand palace with heavy fabrics and plush carpets but doesn't feel stuffy.  location is right in walking distance to pretty much anything you will want to see.",5,2015,12,10
29,Outstanding Hotel,"My wife and I were on a 16 day tour of France and Spain, with 3 nights in Barcelona.  I was debating staying in the Gothic quarter, but saw the El Palace in a Virtuoso travel magazine, and knew it was the place!  It's a few blocks out of the Gothic quarter, and a 15-20 min walk, but there is a cab stand at the hotel, and cabs in Barcelona are cheap and easy.
The room was wonderful.  I had a large, modern bathroom, with a great shower.  
The concierge staff were GREAT!  They all recognized us, and knew our name from the moment we checked in.  We aren't VIPs, we are normal people, but they really made us feel special.",5,2015,12,06
29,Tops !!!,"We visited Barcelona and booked in at the El Palace.

The hotel is very grand in it appearance and the staff are great. Very warm, pleasant to help & professional.

We stayed in a very nice junior suite which was well appointed.

We dined in the restaurant and although the food is very much ""in vogue style"" it was pleasant albeit a little too somber for us.

Room service breakfast was very good and arrived on time and hot.

Ps...try the tapas bar local to the hotel which was fab (out the door, take a left and its 100 Mtrs ) ",5,2015,12,04
29,ABOVE EXCELLENCE,"My wife and I wanted to stay in Barcelona a few days before boarding our cruise ship . After there days at the El Palace we did not want to leave. The hotel , staff , service , location were all GREAT ! . We can not say enough good things about the hotel and staff except THANKS and we will be back.",5,2015,12,03
29,"excellent location, wonderful staff, nice property!","1. Really nice and helpful staff. 
I had problems when paying online with my credit card, they were very patient to help solving the problem.
I asked for a quite room and my request was very well met.
During my stay in the hotel, the staff were so polite and so helpful! 

2. Great location!!! walking distance to major attractions and shopping area. You cannot beat it.

3. The room was very nice. Good size, nice decor, comfort bed, good linen. Everythings worked wonderful. 

Too bad that I did not have time to try the restaurant. Looks very nice though.",5,2015,12,03
29,Best hotel I stayed at in Europe! Truly recommend!,"I often travel in my profession and I am often quite critical to the hotels I spend too much of my time. But in this case I am very, very impressed. The service and attitude from the staff was professional, genuine and kind. And then I mean all the staff I got in contact with.The atmosphere and style of the hotel is very nice. The room was excellent, the pillows and beds top quality, breakfast buffé was splendid. I can go on forever, but please take my advice and stay at this hotel if you get the chance. Hotel is situated right in the center. My complimants to the management who has been able to achieve such a standard and prideness among the staff.",5,2015,12,03
29,Old world luxury,"What a fantastic throw-back to a glamorous time, when travel was elegant.  This hotel exudes old world charm and luxury, and the service was impeccable.  As soon as you walk in the lobby, you cannot help but admire the luxurious drapings and smell the lovely scent wafting through the air.  You are immediately put at ease.  To be clear, the trappings are extraordinarily luxurious, but the service was certainly not pretentious; in fact, all the staff are kind and very professional.  Katharina was truly an asset to the property, offering expert advice and tips for sightseeing, restaurants - no request was too much of a hassle for her, and she handled everything perfectly and with charm.

The room and bathroom were appropriately luxurious, but not gaudy.  I thought the in-room amenities were as to be expected from a hotel of this caliber. To be honest, Barcelona is so buzzing and exciting, we did not spend a terrible amount of time in the room, but the bed was very comfortable, and I cannot think of a single thing I would change.  

I will also highly compliment the food.  Starting with breakfast and ending with dinner and drinks, you will not be disappointed in this hotel.  Such a treat!",5,2015,12,02
29,Exceeded Expectations,"Booked this place for a weekend break based on TA reports and did not know what to expect but I needn't have worried as it exceeded expectations on nearly all accounts. Great service, nice rooms, pleasant public areas and well located for all the sights. We arrived before lunch but our room was already available. Very friendly reception and helpful concierge particularly Alexis. I'm a poor sleeper and had reservations about the main road but the insulation is very good and i had uninterrupted sleep which is a big plus for me. There's a pillow menu which allows you to swap pillow types. Wifi is very good.

Breakfast was served in a very pleasant garden room - a touch expensive but no doubting the quality - a good range of pastries, breads and meats etc. I also found the cocktail lounge expensive but again you pay for quality. We didn't use the restaurant (Caelis) as the menu was a bit limited for my wife but the manager told us later that we should have mentioned this and they would have sorted something out for her - that shows the class of the place.  

Overall we were delighted with this place and would certainly use again.",5,2015,12,02
29,One of the best hotels in Spain,"We retired this year and after going to Barcelona 18 months ago with my son I had promised to take Val my wife so here we are. 
I had taken her to the Lapa Palace in Lisbon in May this year. That was an incredibly hard act to follow as in my humble opinion the Lapa was the best hotel I had ever been in. 
Well we stayed for 11 nights at the Palace in Barcelona and it certainly warranted the 5 stars rating. Best of all was the concierge and staff at front of desk. Simply fantastic. I am lost for superlatives. Nothing was too much trouble.
The room was exquisite, clean and a supreme testament to the outlook of this 5 star Grande Luxe hotel. Only the best will do. 

I now have 2 hotels that I will be revisiting in 2016.",5,2015,11,28
29,Amazing Place with Superior and Personalized Service,"This is one of the finest hotels my husband and I stayed in in Europe and across the US as well.  This hotel is classy, comfortable, exquisite and exceptional.  Service is of the highest standard imaginable and the staff are simply amazing.  Alexia and Xavier made us feel like we were at home and not 5000 miles away!  Breakfast was marvelous and frankly there are not enough adjectives to positively describe this hotel.  It is a palace that is warm and welcoming and elegant!!  Would return in a heartbeat!",5,2015,11,27
29,Only El Palace! Back to this hotel!,"We already visited the hotel El Palace in Barcelona in summer this year. 
We liked this hotel so much! After this trip we already wrote a review, how wonderful this hotel is. 
Several days ago we were in Bacelona again and surely, we stayed in El Palace hotel again. 
High service, welcome staff, tasty breakfast, cozy and spaceful rooms - great hotel!",5,2015,11,26
29,Opulent surroundings and luxury service,"Visiting this hotel feels like you are stepping back in time ... to when travel was still
luxurious, and personalized service was the norm. There are extraordinary touches everywhere, making every space beautiful, and the guest room is of course no exception! I don't think I've seen such a beautiful closet ever in any hotel room (I know that sounds a little crazy, but it is a really amazing space), and the bathroom is spectacular.  Everywhere you go, you feel like you're on a movie set or something.  Short walk to all in-city destinations, and extraordinary concierge attention to help direct you.  I would not hesitate to return for business or pleasure.  ",5,2015,11,20
29,Memorable Majestic Magical Hotel,"We were celebrating my husband's special birthday and such a wonderful experience in this  'prima donna' El Palace hotel. The classical  decor and furnishings of the hotel are breathtaking and such a lovely sense of detail to everything in the hotel. Each area of the hotel has different beautiful attractions from the foyer to Grande Room to the Breakfast Garden  Dining  area and the Michelin star Caelis Restaurant.
The decor, ambience and cleanliness of the bedrooms were of the highest standard.
The cocktail bar with excellent music is a special treat with Alfredo and his team.
The roof garden and outdoor pool provides spectacular panoramic views of Barcelona.
Nina is passionate in highlighting this 'hidden gem' .. not to be missed!
The entire management and staff team are highly professional and friendly.
We have no hesitation in recommending this classic hotel.
Look forward to our next visit!",5,2015,11,18
29,Comfortable and inviting,"Spent 5 nights here. Found the staff very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Room comfortable with large bathroom and nice amenities. Roof terrace and pool worth a visit. Only downside is street noise so pack earplugs.",5,2015,11,17
29,New Royal Carpets,"A happy vacation starts with the right hotel so it was a relief to witness the change of staircase carpets in the middle of my stay at the El Palace--they're making the holidays their deadline to make the right impression when you walk in.

I love the royal furnishings in the grand lobby lounge with its high ceilings as well as the blue room behind it. The cozy hotel bar downstairs has a live band on weekends at 11:00 pm. My room 510 had afternoon sunlight streaming in, a view of the Gran Via, a walk-in closet, a strong rain shower, and an adorable retro style tea kettle.

I find Barcelona to be the most fun city in Europe for its mix of fun and charming people from different parts of the world who loved staying up late. It has a variety of art, sights, shopping, dining, and architecture all in close proximity if you're staying at the El Palace because it sits at the heart of the city, near the corner of Gran Via and Passeig de Gracia. 

If you'd rather not walk, this hotel is two blocks from a couple of metro lines and if you'd rather stay above ground, there's a taxi stand right outside the hotel's front door.

El Palace is a quiet oasis after a busy day out and about. The staff is always attentive and helpful. Housekeeping always on time. A massage at the spa ends with a sip of juice and diced fruit. Special thanks to Alexis at Concierge and Nina and Susan who add extra sunshine to their quaint rooftop pool garden.

Can't wait to bring my entire family to Barcelona and El Palace. Thanks to Tripadvisor for this great find!",5,2015,11,16
29,CLASSIC COMFORT,"If you are looking for old world charm combined with the highest standards of customer care this is the place for you. From the moment of arrival the professional staff are attentive and ready to respond to requests in an efficient and timely manner. The room we had was spacious, comfortably furnished and immaculately clean. Barcelona has much to offer but for time spent in the hotel there is also much to enjoy from stunning roof garden offering panoramic views and swimming pool, intimate cocktail bar, first rate spa and intriguing breakfast room. We ate in the on premise one Michelin star Caelis Restaurant and the roof garden and enjoyed the very different cuisine equally. Certainly a hotel I will return to.

Medya",5,2015,11,13
29,A luxurious stay!,"The location, accommodations and décor would have been more than enough, but it is truly the staff that makes this a five-star destination. Attentive, polite and first class, we were treated like royalty from the moment we checked in. The concierge provided us with superb recommendations, while the housekeeping staff greeted us with smiles every morning. We walked the city with ease, being  in the center of everything, and enjoyed all that Barcelona has to offer. This is old-world charm with all the modern amenities - a perfect stay!",5,2015,11,10
29,Awesome hotel!,"The Stay at this hotel started by walking into one of the more beautiful lobbies we have ever encountered.  The staff matched the special character of the establishment.  They went out of their way to help us  make our visit to Barcelona very special.  They were always on hand for help, guidance and advice for any questions we had.  The rooms in this old world  hotel were very comfortable with all the requisite amenities.  We particularly would like to thank Alexis Negrillo at the concierge desk for all his insights and assistance.

Phyllis, Frank, Janet and Bob",5,2015,11,08
29,Loved It!,"The decor is grand and opulent with high ceilings and little touches of 100+ years ago. The junior suite we were upgraded to had been renovated, tastefully combining old school decor with modern touches. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bars (both the lobby and the downstairs bar that has a live band playing at weekends) were excellent too. All at a price but one that offered value for money, in my opinion. I would definitely go back on future trips to BCN. ",5,2015,11,08
29,Great Hotel,The Palace Hotel is old world beautiful. In a previous life it was the Ritz. There's a plaque in the footpath outside the front door. Rooms are generous. Bathrooms great. Bed comfortable. The restaurants are amazing. And the staff attentive and helpful. This is a really nice place to stay. ,5,2015,11,03
29,Grand hotel in every respect,"We joined cousins of ours in Barcelona.  They chose the hotel because they wanted to treat themselves as a start to a long deserved vacation.  It was  good choice.   
Since I was in Spain 9 years ago there seems to be much less smoking which is all the better for travelers like us.  Unfortunately some travelers don't respect the no smoking policies.  I experienced this more than once in this trip to Spain and Portugal.  I don't believe it is the hotel's fault.  This said, there was a short delay in the room preparation for our traveling companion but they were completely satisfied with the room which was prepared for them.

The El Palace has a roof top pool with restaurant service.  When we were there it was on the cool side to swim but a great place to relax and have a drink.

The staff was incredibly helpful in all respects.  I started a little game of trying to go though the main doors before some one was there to help.  They are quick.

I had breakfast there twice.  Breakfast is served a grand room with a complete buffet.  I attempted to try every thing but that was way past my appetite. 

As we got to know our way around we could appreciate how well this hotel was situate for us.",5,2015,11,02
29,Beautiful hotel,Great location - super friendly and helpful staff - especially the concierge staff - room and bathroom elegant and comfortable - they give you 6 choices of pillows and there is a great kettle and tea bags to make tea quickly anytime you want it. We would definitely stay here again,5,2015,10,31
29,Perfect grand palace,"It's the first time I booked this place, but it will not be the last. The service is impeccable, the personnel is very kind and helpful and will do everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible. If you like Michelin restaurants you will be in good hands in the Caelis. The spa is wonderful and unique in Europe with his Mayan concept. It has been rewarded three years in a row. The swimming pool on the rooftop is small of course... but very beautiful. Situated very centrally. Member of the Leading Hotels of the World.",5,2015,10,30
29,"Elegant, great location and service","We arrived mid-morning, tired and frazzled, after many hours of travel.  While our room wasn't quite ready, sipping refreshing mint tea and relaxing in the lovely lobby perked us up. Our room was spotless, large and comfortable, as was the bathroom. Bottled water was provided.  It was easy to get help with directions, reservations for dinner and sites and airline reservation hassles.  We loved exploring Barcelona, but also loved coming back each night to our beautiful hotel.",5,2015,10,29
29,Amazing stay!!!!,We just returned from a 3 night visit. Our favorite hotel in all of Europe. The room was quite large and in perfect condition. The best part of our visit though was Susanna at the rooftop bar/pool/restaurant. Very helpful with menu items and local tapas restaurants to try!,5,2015,10,29
29,Fantastic,"My 2 sisters and I aged 50,47 & 44, stayed here for the weekend in September, both our parents passed away recently and after the sale of the house we decided to take ourselves off for a little break. 
This was fantastic brilliant really cheered us up!. We booked a triple room the 3rd bed was a little short but perfect for one of my sisters who is only 5ft 5"". The whole hotel was immaculate. The beds were turned down every evening and made every morning. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the concierge team were wonderful really helpful recommending Tapa's restaurants etc. The Pool area was quiet and the lady there was very nice bringing fresh towels, offering to take photos and pointing things out to us. We paid for the breakfast which was very good. After a very busy day lots of walking enjoying the Tapas recommended to us by the concierge it was wonderful to return to the hotel around midnight to find live music in the underground bar it was like going back in time. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if you don't then there is something wrong with you. Would love to go back with my husband and sons but maybe just a little out of my price range. Go on treat yourself.",5,2015,10,26
29,"Perfect, Well-Located, Friendly Hotel","The El Palace Hotel had everything we wanted.  It was near a Metro stop on the edge of the Old City. We could walk to the Palau de la Musica in 5-10 minutes.  We walked to the Sagrada Familia in 20-25 minutes.  The staff was completely multi-lingual and answered all questions.  There were always several staff in the lobby to help guests.  The breakfast was magnificent.  It was hot and cold--with 5 or 6 types of magnificent fresh fruit.  The rooms facing the street were completely quiet with the windows closed. We were at the hotel for 4 days in October, 2015 and had a very good experience.  We ate dinner in the hotel one evening.  It was very good.",5,2015,10,24
29,Elegant Hotel Exceptional Service,"From the moment I arrived I was impressed by the exceptional staff that greeted me and the beauty of the interiors. I had booked a suite and was escorted to a beautifully decorated and well appointed ""suite"" with city views. While my stay was short, it was nothing less than fabulous. From check in, the valet, room service, the concierge and the housekeeping staff, all absolutely outstanding. When I returned a week later for a one night stay I was upgraded to the Salvador Dali Suite (where he lived with his wife for a period). I didn't want to leave, it was superb!",5,2015,10,24
29,Old world charm with exceptional service,"If you want to stay in a hotel which exudes class, and old world European charm, this is it.  From the moment we checked in, the staff couldn't be any more helpful.  Julia from guest relations introduced herself to us, and remembered our name during our entire stay.  The hotel room was large, as was the bathroom and decorated to suit the hotel.  Our king sized bed was quite comfortable and firm.   Large 40 foot ceilings, comfortable lounges and a beautiful breakfast garden room all were done at a level one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  This hotel was located only 2 blocks from the Passeig de Gracia, and avoided the hoopla of this very hectic section of town, yet was within walking distance of the fashionable shops and restaurants of Barcelona.  Free wifi was available throughout the hotel and the speeds were quite adequate.",5,2015,10,23
29,Beautiful Hotel and Excellent Customer Service,"This is a beautiful 5 Star hotel.  From the intoxicating smells when you enter the door to the spacious rooms and wonderful service, this was a 5 star experience.  My husband and I enjoyed our stay her and we would most definitely recommend.",5,2015,10,20
29,Exceptional All Round,"If you are going to Barcelona don't overlook this hotel. From the minute you arrive the experience is superb. The staff are very polished and friendly and can't do enough to help and ensure your stay is exceptional. The amenities are first class. Rooms beautiful, good size, excellent bathrooms with all the extras. The place is all round beautiful with a lot of thought on comfort and class. Staying here is an experience from check in to check out. Location is great. ",5,2015,10,20
29,The perfect Hotel for me,"Once again I was able to visit this beautiful property. And was a great surprise that now they have also a wonderful pool on their terrace.  No upgrade this time, but we really don't care as even their standard room is fantastic, beautiful, really clean and with plenty of space for my family. Staff was friendly and always smiling especially to my son.  We hope to be able to visit this beautiful Hotel after Christmas again",5,2015,10,20
29,Perfection!,"This Hotel will live in my mind for the rest of my days as the perfect hotel experience.  Of course it is exceptionally beautiful with the restoration to its glory days but the key to this wonderful place is the staff.  Without exception they were professional but friendly and, yes, fun, from the front desk concierge team to the breakfast waiters and the delightful   bartenders.  Our room was lovely with a bathroom from a dream -- a sunken Roman tub with beautiful mosaic tile, a new complex shower, double sinks.  
A new roof-top pool was wonderful with splendid views across the city and food and drink delivered as you relaxed.  
The breakfast buffet was bountiful and delicious including every food imaginable.
If only I could award a 6th Star!",5,2015,10,16
29,Beautiful Hotel!,"My husband and I had a wonderful time during our stay at El Palace Hotel.. The staff were very friendly and professional. The daily breakfast buffet was a very nice selection of hot and cold food. All the shops were in walking distance from the hotel. 

The reason why we gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because we feel that the hotel could use a little updating. The rugs in the lobby area needed to be cleaned. We felt that the rooms were very small but overall the hotel has an old world charm and elegance that we both appreciated. I would recommend a stay in this hotel.",4,2015,10,15
29,Fantastic! ,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Location very central but far enough to feel very quiet. Staff amazing and extremely courteous and helpful. My boyfriend and I had a room on the 6th floor. Our room had a hallway with internal doors so completely cut out any noise one usually hears in communal areas of other guests leaving rooms etc. the room was beautifully decorated in restful and soft furnishings and fitted with black out curtains ensuring a good sleep! The bed was very comfortable with a mattress topper feeling like a luxurious bed. The bathroom was so beautiful with a separate bath and a rain shower, and two sinks. What I also loved was how practical it was in that there were numerous plug points including in the bathroom so I could do my hair in the bathroom with a proper mirror instead of an awkward location somewhere in the room without access to a mirror. There were also lots of soft lighting options so one could have the room lit as bright or soft as you like. We would not even look at anywhere else to stay when we return to Barcelona. Book here, you will not be disappointed. The numerous positive reviews are all true! ",5,2015,10,14
29,"Amazing experience! Great staff, luxury hotel, great location.","I had an absolutely amazing experience at El Palace. I came with my mom and the hotel and its staff went above and beyond my expectations! First of all, the staff was amazing. You can tell that they truly care about their guests. My room was always spotless, and it was very luxurious as well. I also got a massage at the spa which was phenomenal and included many little extras that I was not expecting, such as my own little personal room with a shower and bathroom, a sauna that I had all to myself before hand and a huge luxury shower that I used after drinking my tea in the lounge area. I highly recommend! It is Mayan themed which was very cool.

The terrace on the roof was amazing! My server, Susannah, was awesome so ask for her if you go. Beautiful view with a great staff that was very attentive, kind, and welcoming. The concierge was great as well! I cannot explain enough about how great the staff was.

The food was amazing too! I ordered a huge room service one day which was excellent, but I highly recommend getting the buffet breakfast because it is outstanding. they have everything you could ever imagine that you wanted to eat for breakfast, even desserts! Great experience in a beautiful breakfast room.

I loved this hotel! It was amazing. The location was perfect, with about a 7 minute walk into the Plaza Catalunya (main part of the city). It is right on Gran Via which is a street that many things are accessible from! 

Beautiful hotel, great decor, great history, and awesome people! Will definitely be going back.",5,2015,10,14
29,A luxury hotel that cares about its guests,My wife and I celebrated a special anniversary at this superb hotel and were really impressed not only by the hotel itself- which is very impressive- but also by the way guests are treated. We were shown to our room on arrival but soon discovered that one of the window had been left open by a previous guest during a torrential rainstorm with the result that the carpet was sodden. We took this up with the Guest Relations/ Customer Services Manager who immediately made every effort to find us an equivalent room. Our stay at this hotel was made by this young lady's professionalism; she recommended and booked a fantastic restaurant for us and even made sure that a bottle of Cava awaited us in our room on our anniversary. This was a truly memorable stay and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and I also hope that the management recognise the exemplary service provided by this particular member of their staff who seemed to be running the front of house activities for our entire stay.,5,2015,10,13
29,Beautiful hotel.,"We only stayed one night, for a special occasion, but what a wonderful hotel. The decor is superb and the quality of service from all of the staff was exceptional. If you arrive by car, as we did, the doorman will park your car and return it on check out.
We had an enjoyable lunch on the roof terrace where Susanna went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Although we went out to eat in Barcelona we did have a drink in the cocktail bar, which is quite intimate, and listened to a very good blues band. There was an excellent choice for breakfast, served in the garden room, where again we were looked after by all the staff. 
We couldn't fault this hotel and will definitely stay again.",5,2015,10,12
29,4 fine nights,"quiet.......very ""old world"" elegant.......huge common area for 85 {?} rooms.....smallish but nice rooms.....excellent baths......beds somewhat firmer than average......pleasant and helpful staff[except an undertrained trainee in the bar area]..........well situated in the city......can walk to the national musical theatre and old town.......has a michelin 1 star restaurant for fine dining......would repeat",5,2015,10,11
29,Another 5 star visit,"This visit was probably our 8 th or 9 th visit to this hotel . We arrived by train & showed the taxi driver our hotel on our reservation.....he said "" oh, you are staying at the Ritz, the nicest ,old hotel in Barcelona "".That statement summarizes our opinion of this hotel....it is great. The breakfast buffet was excellent & concierges could not have been better . The doormen were some of our favorites",5,2015,10,10
29,Wonderful stay in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed at the El Palace Hotel for three nights following a two week Mediterranean cruise. We had a wonderful stay at what is one of the finest hotels we have stayed at before. Everything from the reception, the lobby, the concierge desk, the rooftop terrace and the room were just perfection. The location is great as a base to explore Barcelona. Old town Barcelona is walking distance from the hotel as well as many cafe's and shopping. We will not look for any other hotel options on our next trip to Barcelona. Highly recommend.",5,2015,10,06
29,Great start to our Spain trip,"This hotel was our first hotel on our first trip to Spain, checking in after a 23 hour journey from Melbourne. We stayed 6 nights in a standard room. We can only laud the hotel, it was excellent in every respect. Our room was spacious, well fitted and beautifully decorated. While we faced onto the street the noise from the street was insignificant and never a distraction. Apart from the beautiful common areas on the ground floor, including the breakfast room, the stand out for us was the exceptional quality of the staff and the service they consistently provided. From the way the check in and room presentation was handled to the helpfulness of the concierge desk with each and every request we made, this aspect was fantastic. Hard to fault, a great start to our holiday.",5,2015,10,05
29,Excellent,"Excellent and very impress with this hotel.
From very friendly staff, great breakfast , great atmosphere . Great location.
We are very happy to recommend this hotel to everybody . Definitive we will stay again.",5,2015,10,04
29,World Class Hotel,"World class hotel, by any standard. No need to restate prior reviewers, but just affirm all the five star comments. We travel extensively and this hotel has all the small, personal touches that separate great from good.  The new rooftop pool area is a real nice addition. Our hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,30
29,It's hard to find anything to say that others haven't already expressed....,"but I'll add my kudos to the staff of the hotel and, of course to the hotel itself.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was ""courtyard"" facing (I use the term loosely.)  It was lovely and had more than enough room to spread out.  Included with our room was the continental breakfast which was adequate since we had lunches and dinners reserved for our 4 night stay.  The concierge staff was extraordinarily helpful with directions, and for tickets to a couple of attractions we had not previously visited. The location of the hotel lends itself to easy walking or catching a subway train or cab  quickly.  We would be thrilled to stay at El Palace again !",5,2015,09,28
29,Magnificent Hotel,"Although we only stayed at the Palace for one night, I can honestly say it is one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed at. The service is impeccable and great care is taken to maintain an overall standard of excellence.
      ",5,2015,09,28
29,Check out lounge area,"Found the lounge area by accident and loved the atmosphere.  Elegant hotel with friendly staff, really good cocktails and jazz music on the weekends.  Spent a few hours relaxing and enjoying the surroundings.  A definite must.  While there, look at the photos on the wall of the many musicians.",4,2015,09,24
29,Splendid,"Myself and my mother stayed here for three nights on our recent trip to the vibrant city of Barcelona. I based my choice on other reviews of this hotel and was not dissapointed. It lives up to its 5 star rating. All of the staff and the service provided was excellent. The concierge service in particular is very helpful and informative. 

Check in was quick and easy, the twin room was very well appointed and spacious with lots of amenities to make your stay comfortable. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel which was quite pricey at 25 euros per person but it was lovley and served in the most beautiful garden room setting where we chose to take breakfast outside.

The hotel is very well located and only 10 minutes from the centre where you can pick up a open topped bus tour or stroll down Las Ramblas.

One fantastic additon to the hotel is the roof top pool area. One afternoon after lots of sightseeing and walking it was wonderfully relaxing to chill out by the pool and enjoy the pretty surroundingS and lovely view from the seventh floor.

I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.  Enjoy!!",5,2015,09,24
29,Birthday Lunch ,"What a fabulous day !! We had a lovely lunch on the roof terrace, gorgeous quinoa, tortilla, roasted vegetable and Turkey with gruyere sandwiches finished with beautiful sweet strawberries, chocolate and champagne. Our room was gorgeous the king sized bed has a fantastic coconut mattress that feels as though you're floating on air, a huge shower/steam room, jacuzzi bath and luxurious, fluffy dressing gowns that we fell asleep in. Our number one choice everytime in Barcelona and the staff are second to none !! ",5,2015,09,24
29,Elegant Remarkable Super Star Hotel !,This Hotel used to be The Ritz and every elegant brilliant touch in the rooms and hotel and restaurants testify to that ! The service is beyond anything I've ever seen in my life ! This Hotel made my wedding anniversary ! There is a phenomenal pool on the roof that is the highlight of my entire trip ! You must go there to experience its beauty and comfort and unique elegance ! ,5,2015,09,24
29,Beautiful place to stay,"It was our first day in Barcelona, after a 14 hour flight from Singapore we kind of hoped to stay in a nice place. This Hotel gives you that feeling when you reach, reception is very nice staff is very helpful and the rooms are very nice. At least the one we stayed in... Breakfast is really good spread, not that you run out of choices in Barcelona but a good breakfast makes your day better. We recommend you to stay here !!",5,2015,09,21
29,Loved it!,"Gorgeous size hotel with great comfortable well sized rooms that have everything you need!
Hotel decor was amazing and the location was perfect.
Service was wonderful... The staff went out of their way to help me - in particular the concierge posting my shopping to Australia for me! Thank you so much Alexis and Francisco for all of your help!
The rooftop pool and bar is a must do - as well as the martini and cigar lounge!
Don't miss out on the spa either - I had the most incredible massage!",5,2015,09,20
29,"Superb service, setting and scenery","Outstanding location, gorgeous decor, excellent service, well appointed, good-sized rooms and a central location within walking distance of popular attractions, world-class shopping, amazing architectural wonders and mouth-watering meals mark this deservedly 5-star hotel. It served as a fabulous six-day end to a wonderful 44-day European foray that took us to nine countries, cultures and cuisines.",4,2015,09,20
29,El Palace Hotel Barcelona,I have traveled extensively and stayed in many 5 star hotels.  The Palace in Barcelona is equal to any of them. It's location is two blocks away from best shopping street in Barcelona and a 10 minute walk to Rambla.  Very helpful staff.,5,2015,09,20
29,Outstanding service,Everything in this hotel is designed to make its guests feel comfortable. Huge lobby has multiple arm-chairs and sofas if a guest is waiting for someone or just wants to read a newspaper. Service is absolutely impeccable. Breakfast spread is plentiful and delicious. Rooms are huge and comfortable with large bathrooms. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2015,09,17
29,A real gem in Barcelona! Superb stay!,"Fabulous location, wonderful ambience, friendly, helpful and professional staff that go out of their way to assist with old world charm and elegance.  My favorite hotel in Europe and throroughly enjoyed by our party of six adults, who could not fault the hotel.  What a gem!  You will struggle to find a better hotel than this.   The breakfast venue is delightful and a real treat!

29,An Oasis in the center of Barcelona,"I wish we could go back tomorrow.  The Palace was gorgeous...very old fashioned decor and service with all the modern conveniences.  We were greeted on arrival by the doorman, the front desk staff and the concierge.  All were helpful without being intrusive.  Our room was quiet, cool and beautifully furnished.  The staff assisted with tickets to the sights we wanted to see and directed us to nearby restaurants when we chose to leave the comfort of the hotel.  We had dinner one night in the hotel restaurant which was good with the exception of the ""tuna in the can"" and potato chips which were served as appetizers...seemed quite out of sync with the formality and class of the venue.  All in all though, we could not have made a better choice for our three days in this delightful city.",5,2015,09,13
29,Wonderful stay,"We recently stayed at the El Palace Hotel. The rooms were comfortable ,the staff friendly and extremely helpful. The new pool area is fantastic after a long day sight seeing. The concierges were great giving us tips on where to go or helping us change reservations. Plenty of space in the rooms, great bathrooms and showers. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,09,11
29,"Great Hotel, Best Location","Maybe the best location in Barcelona - easy walking to most of the major attractions. Spacious rooms, gorgeous lobby, clean, very helpful concierge and staff.  Best breakfast buffet I have had in a long time.",5,2015,09,10
29,A Fantastic Hotel,"We loved this hotel, it was excellent value and so full of character and charm. Breakfast was good and set in a beautiful room - could have stayed longer. Room was beautiful and the hotel is set in a great spot - easy to explore the city.  We received a welcome message a few days before our expected arrival and overall the whole feeling of the hotel is welcoming. They excel at what they do!",5,2015,09,09
29,Excellent hotel - prime location!,"We arrived here 3 days ago and check out tomorrow, and our stay could not have been better. This is the start of a month long trip through Europe to celebrate my 60th birthday. On arrival was a bottle of champagne and chocolates to mark the occasions courtesy of the manager. Our room was absolutely lovely - good size, comfortable bed with very soft linens, large bathroom with tub and separate shower, French bath amenities. Breakfast in the garden room was excellent - a great selection to choose from. Service overall has been exceptional, from the front desk staff, to the lovely attendants at the roof top pool, to the hostess and wait staff at breakfast, and particularly the concierge staff. I haven't stayed in a hotel with this level of attentive and, more importantly, warm and genuine staff. To top it all off, the location could not bear better - walking distance to a majority of the sites in the city. Highly recommend.",5,2015,09,09
29,Grand Hotel,We really enjoyed everything about this hotel. The staff was exceptional and the room was beautiful with a great view. The pool was wonderful but wish it was open past 7pm. We arrived in Barcelona at 8:30 and were in our room by 9:30 so they were very good to have us a room for early check in.,5,2015,09,09
29,Excellent hotel with very special staff,"Excellent hotel with very special staff.
Excellent and beautiful hotel located by Gran Via de Les Corts Catallanes in Barcelona, Spain.
Stay in this beautiful hotel is like to live in a palace. It worth to visit

29,"Great location, property and staff","Hotel lived up to expectations, with friendly and attentive staff, nicely furnished high class hotel rooms and lobby, and within easy walking distances to Gaudi buildings and Las Ramblas.  The only ""down side"", if you have to list one, is the cost, but you get what you pay for - look for a good deal on the various websites.",5,2015,09,08
29,Classic Elegance and Service to Match,"Even better than the former Ritz, which occupied this location. A grand hotel with attentive service, onsite Michelin starred restaurant, gorgeous lounge, and great location make it the perfect package. The corner suite with two rooms worked perfectly for our family of four.  A premium property worth every euro.",5,2015,09,04
29,Fantastic and Great,"Excellent ! Elegant historical decor and apply modern tech cleverly such as the amazing magic mirror TV and bookshelf-like cover of mini-bar. We stayed 4 nights here and everything just perfect.  

For SPA services, it was just so-so (but seems that it was not operated by the Hotel).   

For breakfast, services were depends as one day",5,2015,09,04
29,First class experience.,Excellent hotel. The room was very comfortable with a lot of space. Great location allowed us to walk to all major sites in Barcelona. The concierge was especially helpful. Great team there. First class hotel. We had a wonderful experience. Will stay there again next time we are in Barcelona.,5,2015,08,30
29,Fantastic customer service!,"El Palace is without doubt an elegant and luxurious building in a wonderful position but anyone who loves travel will know that such matters are only part of the equation. It's the people who meet, greet and respond to your needs and requests who make such a difference and the management here have got it so right. From the concierge to the bar staff, the response is quick, friendly and effective. Nothing is too much trouble and nothing appears false or forced. They were wonderful. The roof top terrace and pool is a fantastic addition, allowing us to have a 'lazy' day in the otherwise hectic but joyous week long stay in this beautiful city. Won't hesitate to stay here again when we next visit.",5,2015,08,26
29,We will be back,"After 2 weeks touring southern France we flew to Barcelona from Bordeaux for 2 nights to get a direct flight to NY.  Didn't realize we would be staying in our favorite hotel of our trip.

Perfect location, beautiful decor (they upgraded us to a Jr Suite) the guest relations young lady (Julie who is a huge asset to the hotel) thought we were way to young to be celebrating our 20th anniversary (flattery will add stars to any review!) and a lovely rooftop pool and lounge after a hard day of touring made this the perfect place to finish our trip.

We were numb after walking over 10 miles on day 2 so utilized the Mayan spa which was very nice.

One small annoyance was the breakfast included in the rate was only 2 of the 4 serving tables and was quite basic and it was an additional 15 euros to upgrade to all 4.  Just seems a little cheesy to squeeze a small sum for the full spread for such a classy hotel.  Young lady seemed a little embarrassed as she told us the way it works.

Overall still a 5 star and with more to see in Barcelona, we will be visiting again!",5,2015,08,26
29,The Epitome of Excellence!,"This is my second time visiting El Palace Hotel in Barcelona. I have to say I was tempted by some good deals at other hotels, but when I called the others I was either treated rudely or found lots of extra costs added on. So I called the El Palace and found them to very nice and helpful.
This hotel is truly the Epitome of Excellence. The Staff is very friendly, the rooms are elegant and the buffet Breakfast was outstanding.I was so glad I decided to stay there once again.!! 
It is close to everything so you can easily walk to Las Ramblas and old town.
They have put an elegant rooftop lounge and pool in that is designer gorgeous
Loved my stay there and will come back!",5,2015,08,22
29,"A too short, but wonderful visit to Barcelona","El Palace is an elegant hotel, wonderfully located. It is like staying in a beautiful hotel of the 1800's, but with all the modern conveniences.  The staff is wonderful, especially Julie the concierge, who truly made our stay magical, with directions, restaurant recommendations all of which were spot on. She also went to great effort to correct an airline reservation problem for us.  We will definitely stay there again.",5,2015,08,21
29,Outstanding customer service,"Most luxurious and beautiful hotel we've stayed in throughout Europe. Like stepping back in time, but not in a museum sort of way, as everything is shiny and new. As if the furnishings and finishings weren't enough, the customer service was the definition of above and beyond. Have to give a special shout out to Juan Carlos, in the downstairs lounge. Where else would you have someone slip a Michael Jackson into the classic jazz playlist as he overheard us discussing his music at our table? Did I mention the hand-crafted cocktails? The view of La Sagrada Familia from the roof top garden? The pillow menu? The hand squeezed juices by the pool?",5,2015,08,19
29,Excellence in Barcelona,"El Palace is perfect in every facet.  The hotel itself is pristine beginning with the marvelous facade and the breathtaking lobby.  The classic deluxe room was incredibly spacious as well as state of the art with all new furnishings and utilities, also the WiFi was perfect.  The service is nothing short of first rate from the informative and friendly bellman, to the meticulous housekeepers, knowledgeable and and accessible concierge, and breakfast staff who couldn't have been more kind and eager to greet us each morning.  The breakfast garden was the best, an immaculate room serving everything you could want each morning in a relaxed environment, it never felt overly busy or crowded which is an incredible feat compared to most hotels.  Finally, the location was great with easy access to major metro lines as well as being walking distance to nearly all of the most popular destinations but at a nice separation from tourist crowds.  Needless to say I would recommend this hotel to all and cannot wait to return!",5,2015,08,19
29,Perfection in Spain,"This hotel is perfect in every way. The rooms, restaurants , bar .....the staff is always working to improve your stay. Walking distance to everything! We stayed here prior to a cruise and wished we could have stayed longer .",5,2015,08,18
29,Perfect!,What a wonderful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. We stayed with our two children 7 & 9 in a junior suite and we absolutely loved it.  Easy walking distance to many of Barcelona destinations.  (I should add we love to walk a city). We had the breakfast buffet every morning and it was a great way to start the day. ,5,2015,08,15
29,Great Hotel ,"Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, very nice and clean rooms, very helpful staff, great bar downstairs with Live Music. But our favorite part was the new rooftop pool area, the staff was very attentive and it was very relaxing with a great view of the city. Highly recommend the El Palace of Barcelona.  ",5,2015,08,14
29,Where is the sixth star?,"A first class hotel in the centre of Barcelona with a lot of ambiente and perfect service. The 5*****L was absolutely ok and well-earned by the hotel until June 2015.
But now they have added a spectacular roof-garden with swimming-pool, snack aerea (a restaurant is under construction) bar and a lot of room for recreation - combined with a breath-taking 360° view. More than excellent.",5,2015,08,14
29,Love this hotwl,"I really like this hotel it is ideally situated, and staff are lovely.
Room was nicely decorated and there was a big bathroom with bath and shower.

Hotel was very elegant and had a nice seating area.
Breakfast was very nice and convenient , however was very expensive so unless it is included with your room I wouldn't eat there every morning.",5,2015,08,13
29,"Fabulous hotel, fabulous staff!","We recently stayed at El Palace for 4 nights. This is the old Ritz and I thought everything about the hotel was excellent. The staff was so responsive - the concierge made all of our restaurant reservations and got us in when we couldn't get ourselves in. The new rooftop pool and bar is wonderful and they are opening a Tapas restaurant on top within a few weeks.
I cannot rave enough about the staff. Lovely people. Also the breakfast is to die for!",5,2015,08,11
29,Elegant. Amazing hotel with superb service,"From the attentive kindness of the bellman to the knowledge of the concierge, from the superbly appointed room with attention to both comfort and luxury, the hotel rates among the best. The food at breakfast was superb in both variety and presentation. Our dinner a their Club 19 was outstanding. Lastly,the location is perfect for walking to many sites and despite being on a major road, quiet and restorative. highly recommend it!!!",5,2015,08,08
29,Excellent service and room,"Nothing short than EXCELLENT.  The hotel staff--all of them--are extremely helpful and kinds.  The junior suite was beautifully decorated, and it  had an excellent bed.  In addition, the breakfast was magnificent!
When in Barcelona, please stay at the El Palace.  It is centrally located, and you can walk to almost all important places for tourists in Barcelona.",5,2015,08,06
29,Above All!,"Our family stayed at the El Palace in Barcelona recently. The hotel room was elegant, sophisticated, modern, and was very luxury. The food at the hotel was outstanding, the staff were highly professional and very friendly. Additionally, the rooms were spacious, and the room service was also outstanding! Although the hotel was a little pricy for a typical room, the room itself compensates for the price of it. The location was great and very family friendly. Over all, our experience at the hotel exceeded our expectations during the duration of our visit to Barcelona, and the El Palace Hotel!!",5,2015,08,06
29,Very disappointed ,"Based on my honeymoon 3 years back I recommended this hotel for my family visit which was for the  last 10 days from 22 July till yesterday but I was very disappointed, service was really bad In the 10 days we stayed not a single room service order came correct due to lack of good English speakers at the other end of the call, internet was very slow for a 5 star hotel I have been in a 3 star and a 4 star hotels in Barcelona with faster internet connection and while we where there for 2 days they where working above our rooms from early morning which woke up everyone again very disappointing :( 

",1,2015,08,01
29,We made the right choice!,"The best aspect of this hotel is the location.....right in the middle of the action! Having said that, the service and attention to detail was also simple fantastic. The feeling of being in a grand building was just special. Thank you for a lovely stay!",4,2015,07,31
29,Outstanding Choice,"This is a stunning hotel from the moment you arrive the staff could not be more helpful.  Little things like chilled flavoured water in the lobby, bedtime chocolates, attentive staff and beautiful decor make this hotel a bit special
Rooms are enormous, bathrooms big and beautiful, separate toilet. And then there's the amazing breakfast room! WOW! We love our lovely hotels and have enjoyed many all over the world, this hotel is up there as one of our best experiences.  Its certainly not bang in the centre of everything, but its not far away.",5,2015,07,29
29,Short stay with best tipps what to do,I have been on a short stay at this great Hotel lately. As I wanted to see as much as possible and not wanted to be stuck in Tourist lines half of the day I have asked the Concierge Ricard for some tipps. I have seen so much - not necessarily very touristy - but so beautiful! I fell in love with Barcelona. If you want to have a great stay in Barcelona stay at this Hotel and ask Ricard! For him I gave the 5 stars Rating!,5,2015,07,29
29,luxurious hotel with very professional and friendly personnel,"The Hotel is in a very good location (near city center and shopping area) and the rooms are really nice and spacious. The room is cleaned twice a day.
I was particularly impressed by the staff, very friendly and professional.",4,2015,07,28
29,New Orleans traveller,"  This hotel is luxurious from the Terrace rooftop pool to the exquisite lobby. The service was impeccable every instance.
The downstairs bar was lively but elegant, and the icing on the cake was the rooftop Terrace. The staff at the Terrace was friendly and professional, and extremely talented at picking local restaurants and venues to explore. Fresh fruit and drinks at the cabana were always refreshing.
I would definetly stay at this jewel in the middle of Barcelona again.",5,2015,07,26
29,"Good location, lovely rooms, but a bit dusty","We enjoyed our stay at El Palace. Service was good, the concierge extremely helpful, the suite stylish, but in the evening, the lobby was deserted and the hotel lacked atmosphere - maybe because of its quaint, if not to say fusty, décor. It was all a bit too old-fashioned for my taste, but then again, that's what the grande dame of Barcelona hotels is supposed to be, I guess.",4,2015,07,24
29,An Oasis in the Middle of Barcelona,"Well here it is in the middle of Barcelona a magnificent hotel with an oasis on the roof!
It has a place to dine for lunch great sunny and shaded spots as well as great service. The pool is just perfect for a dip to take away a long day of touring or shopping tiredness. The rooms are impressive and it sits right in the area for great shopping and great restaurants.
Make a note it is not to be missed",5,2015,07,23
29,Wonderful Hotel,"A truly wonderful hotel. Great amenities, wonderful staff who can not do enough for you and a beautiful hotel from top to toe. 
I highly recommend this hotel. In a great location near first class shopping, lots and lots of restaurants and bars and beautiful buildings on wide avenues. The markets are close by also surrounded by lots of restaurants offering great food at very reasonable prices. But be careful as there are lots of pickpockets so security of your money and credit cards are paramount. But other than that, a top city. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel.",5,2015,07,21
29,"Grand old, sophisticated lady with style","From the time you walk through the grand entrance into the magnificent lobby and beyond you are treated like royalty from any staff member you meet, regardless their position. The decor is palatial and service to match.
Is it expensive? Not really considering the service, attention to detail and sumptuous surrounds.
Even if you are not a house guest you will be met with every courtesy and invited to enjoy this virtual palace for a cold drink on a hot Spanish afternoon. You will be made welcome; and you will be made to feel special.
Originally the Barcelona Ritz; it is rumoured that it may soon fly the Ritz flag again soon.  Very deserving.  
  ",5,2015,07,21
29,Excellent hotel!,"We spent two great nights at this hotel!

29,Vacation ,Great hotel with old world charm and modern amenities.......great central location for all sites....walking distance to restaurants and shopping.... Staff very accommodating...

29,A palace!,Previously known as The Ritz and built in 1905 this hotel retains its turn of the century majesty.  Service from bellboy to check in to general staff is out the top drawer. The lounge is a room if triple volume ceiling that is memorable to say the least.  If the coffee teas and bites are but if your liking than the downstairs blues bar in the basement should fit the bill.  What a fantastic venue and the acts that they had each night were great ... Blues folk etc.  the rooms are if a very high standard and when our family of five arrived for a three night stay the adult room was upgraded free to a suite. Room service award very good and the cleaning staff unobtrusive.  The hotel is well situated. highly recomended. ,5,2015,07,18
29,"World-class setting, service and food","Staying at the stunningly beautiful El Palace capped our trip around Spain on a high note. From the gorgeous individual rooms, grand room and breakfast room we were surrounded by beauty. It  is well-maintained. The knowledgable staff had excellent recommendations for dining out and the morning breakfast had vast choices of fresh food and dishes in the Spanish style. It is also well-located for sight seeing. We have already recommended it to friends, and found that Eileen McDargh and her husband have already planned to stay there. We are blessed to have been able to travel to many places around the world and this is in our top ten list.",5,2015,07,16
29,Spanish Holiday,"We loved this hotel  The lobby area is beautiful and Caelis Restaurant, located in the hotel, is a Michelin restaurant.  The hotel is very well located and within walking distance of many things we wanted to do.  We found the staff to be very eager to please  and friendly.  It was originally The Ritz, opened in the early 1900',s and there is a brass plate in the sidewalk in front of the entrance that was apparently installed when it opened originally. It has been tastefully remodeled and has quiet rooms and modern bathrooms.  I highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,15
29,"The ""Ritz"" of Barcelona","This was a very elegant hotel with mostly older clientele so its got a very classy and chill vibe.
Lovely place for an evening cocktail and very close to all the action downtown.
We had wonderful suite.The beds were extremely comfortable. ",5,2015,07,10
29,Spanish Charm with 5+star accommodations and service.,"Usually a hotel that has charm lacks in modern conveniences or service.  This hotel is one of the few in the world that has both, a winning combinations.  This was one of our first childless trip in almost 20 years (unplanned except for the air reservations ) but we have travelled out of the country extensively and stayed in similar quality hotels.  This hotel surpassed most any we have stayed in anywhere around the world surprising because we had just come from Italy's beautiful Amalfi and a fabulous Paris boutique hotel.
The concierge service was fantastic.  We did not have any plans, any dinner reservations or any idea of what to do in the city.  They gave us an itinerary for the next three days that took us to a monastery we did not even know about (our favorite stop in that city) and recommended wonderful dining options.
Immediately upon arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful room with more than ample space.   The air conditioning worked perfectly in spite of extreme heat conditions.
We dined outside on the patio for breakfast each morning and the buffet was perfect.  The room felt like a ballroom but some how kept intimate.  We actually met wonderful people one breakfast.
We had drinks in the beautiful ""living room"" every afternoon and went to the beautiful jazz and blues club every evening which was packed until they closed at 2:00 am.
Unfortunately the pool top deck was not open when we arrived but is opening some time in July and I understand it will be the best rooftop in Barcelona.
I cannot imagine that there is a better place to stay in all of Barcelona.
Service is first class all the way.",5,2015,07,06
29,Barcelona's Best,"A classic hotel with all of the modern amenities. Truly beautiful. Great rooms, modern bathrooms with great showers. Friendly staff. Great food. Perfect location. Was once the Ritz. Concierge was very helpful.
      ",5,2015,07,02
29,An Oasis of calm and beauty in a hectic and wonderful city.,"Stop and look no further. We have traveled well and the EL Palace ranks amongst the best. Barcelona is a busy and compelling city. This hotel is perfectly located and offers a top notch professional staff to assist your every need.
There is a hush upon entering. Please take a moment and enter the main lobby looking to the bar and eventually to the garden room where a beautiful and healthy breakfast buffet awaits each day. My wife mentioned how beautiful the cherries were and this lovely young service person prepared her a small basket for later.
Special thanks to the concierge staff. They truly know and love their city and will provide expert assistance...in any language.
Look for the intimate downstairs live music room. Great jazz and blues.
EL Palace thrives on traditions and standards. It's all there. Enjoy.",5,2015,07,01
29,Great concierge service and location,"It was our first trip to Barcelona and we wanted to take in as much of the city as possible in the week that we were there.  El Palace is perfectly situated for walking to most of the well known attractions but is on a main transit route so you can easily take the bus, which is what the concierge recommended for our outing to Camp Nou to watch FC Barcelona play in the quarter final UEFA Champions League game.  The hotel is elegant and grand in the old fashion sense.  It was recently renovated so rooms and en suites are modern while maintaining the old world feel and charm.  It is not cookie cutter like some of the other chain hotels, no matter how luxurious. The staff are discreet and efficient.  The concierge is always welcoming and happy to advise and oblige for even the smallest request.  The breakfast buffet is served in the beautiful atrium and the selection and service is wonderful.  Would definitely return to El Palace next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,30
29,Top Notch Treat,Just returned from two night stay in Barcelona following a 7 day cruise of the Mediterranean.  We arrived early on a Saturday morning and only had a short wait until our room was available. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  A visit to the Mayan Spa is a must.  Bed and pillows very comfortable.  Convenient location.,5,2015,06,30
29,Beautiful hotel in great location,"I just returned from 5 nights in Barcelona with my husband at this hotel.  We had previously stayed in the hotel two years ago and returned because we had such a pleasant stay last time.  I arrived from a stay in Nice at a really bad hotel (that should have been good) so I really appreciated the El Palace.

The hotel is truly luxurious with lots of attention to the small details.  The staff could not have been more helpful. Nothing seems to be a problem for them.  We had a lovely room on the second floor.  It is a short walk to both Ramblas and good shopping.  We ate in the Michelin starred retaurant on site and it was the best meal of our trip (and we do like to eat well.)  If you are a tea lover, you have to order tea after dinner as they use a Japanese contraption to make the tea which is really fun.   We also ate at the two star michelin restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental.  We had a nice evening but the food was really not great.  It was not bad, but I would not return again as there are far better restaurants in the city.   If you are visiting the Gaudi bone house, you should plan lunch inside Tenorio which is just steps south of the Guadi house.  It serves really great tapas and it a really nicely decorated air conditioned space (which is great after the heat outside.)

We love Barcelona and will definitely stay at this hotel on our next trip.",5,2015,06,29
29,Gauravbansal1,"The hotel is nice and the staff gives u a warm welcome
The hotel provides  efficient room service 
The hotel has a  great location with every thing nearby but with 2 major drawbacks
1)Hotel doesn't have spa
2) Just couple of machines in gym for workout",3,2015,06,27
29,Wonderful Hotel,"A weekend break to Barcelona was made more memorable and a truly wonderful experience due to our stay at El Palace Hotel. Set in the heart of Barcelona and walking distance to most attractions the reception received on arrival and throughout our stay was second to non. The staff bent over backwards to be as helpful as possible whenever possible. The rooms were of a very high standard, king size bed and blackout blinds we've never slept so well! A/C was quiet and very effective.",5,2015,06,26
29,One night in Barcelona!,"We stayed in the hotel one night prior to a cruise. The staff was perfect. We waited in the grand lobby for a short time for the room to be ready. It was the perfect place to rest after a long flight. We were in the room in no time. The room was large and the bathroom was modern and spacious. The concierge was so willing to assist us with our visit. After a tour of the city, we relaxed in the bar downstairs with wonderful music. We will definitely return to the hotel. It was a very safe area and convenient to many sights.",5,2015,06,26
29,A memorable experience,"If you are looking for gracious hospitality and old world luxury, this is the place.  Additionally, the location was safe and perfect for accessing various neighborhoods inBarcelona such as the port, Eixample, El Barri Gotic, and El Born.  Staff are very courteous, attentive, and knowledgable.  The rooms are quite large by European standards with nice bathrooms.  Very important!",5,2015,06,25
29,Old European glamour,"Magnificent, fully restored hotel in the heart of Barcelona. It's really a throwback to the old, grand hotels of Europe. The rooms are lovely and well-appointed. Not huge, but more than adequate. The renovations were very well thought-out, since the closet and bathrooms were fantastic. Great service! Wonderful breakfast. Walking distance to the city park, zoo, placa Catalunya, and other sites. Wonderful stay!",5,2015,06,24
29,Fantastic hotel!,"Beautiful, elegant hotel in a great location; gracious service by all staff; very helpful concierge service; large room with a king size bed, modern bathroom with a shower and a Roman tub. Absolutely no reason to stay anywhere else.

Great guidance to any adventure you choose! Wonderful tea in the afternoon very refreshing - clean and elegant rooms !  Pick this place for sure ! ,5,2015,06,20
29,lovely elegance,"Small hotel in the center of Barcelona.  Well located to parks, shopping, restaurants,
museums and other points of interest.  Easy to walk most places. Spa facilities available
within the hotel at reasonable rates.  A michelin one star restaurant in the hotel.",5,2015,06,17
29,This is the way it should be.,"The room was very comfortable and totally quiet.   The bed was excellent.   The bathroom was beautifully renovated.   The entire building is lovely--traditional, old but beautifully updated and renovated.   Room service prompt and delicious.  And most of all, the staff was uniformly excellent and friendly.",5,2015,06,15
29,5 Star Hotel,"This hotel deliverers. The rooms are luscious, pillows fantastic, wonderful beds and great bathrooms. The service is what you would expect at a five star and all the amenities. Close to ""The Rumba"" shopping and the Sagrada Familia, a must see during your stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,13
29,Watch out for Construction,"My wife and I had a business conference at the El Palace in Barcelona for 3 nights. We are extremely noise conscious and made sure the hotel was well aware of that prior to our visit as did the travel agent for our group. We are always willing to give up the nice view and be tucked away in a courtyard in exchange for quiet.

We were given what appeared to be a nice Jr. Suite in the courtyard side. I immediately noticed jack hammering (you couldn't miss it) but was told it was temporary and would stop. Little did we know that the hotel was building a rooftop swimming pool and we would be confronted with this noise our entire trip. Our group coordinator told us that she was aware of the construction but had it in our contract that it would not be going on while we were there.

I understand that every business needs to keep improving. Construction is a part of life and sometimes can't be avoided. But with our prior notice of what we were looking for, we feel we should have been told about the construction. Also, it is not unreasonable to expect the construction to stop at a reasonable time so that as a guest you can relax and enjoy your room. This was not the case. Construction last from 9:00 AM to 2:00, then they took a 2 hour siesta break (of course!) and then starting at 4:00 it continued until after 7:00 PM. No matter how often we complained to guest services and no matter how often they told us it was stopping, it never did. Now don't get me wrong, the hotel staff was very nice and courteous (a shout out should go to Julie who was especially nice), but they were powerless it seems to get the noise to stop.

Needless to say it was not a great stay. We never had a chance to relax in our room at the end of each day prior to going to dinner. I will say that when the construction was not blasting away, while we were sleeping, it was quiet.

As far as the hotel itself, it is just OK. It's one of those dated hotels that tries to be classic Europe but could use a bit more TLC. The food was just ordinary but the bathroom was nice, clean and modern. The staff did try and make it up to us at the end by taking half off our bill, but only after I inquired as to what they were going to do to make up for our terrible stay. Believe me I would rather have paid the full rate and enjoyed my stay.

Also, as others have noted, the WIFI is very slow. In today's, world and since I was traveling for business, that was disappointing.",2,2015,06,13
29,Room for improvement ,"Just came back from a 6 night stay, hotel is impressive but lacks substance in areas. Majority of staff aren't very pleasant. We encountered 1 excellent doorman, 1 fantastic Conceirge man who went above and beyond and 1 very efficient and lovely manager who we passed our feedback on to at the end of our stay. The food was quite disappointing for a 5* hotel, we may have just had bad luck but the cleanliness of our room the whole stay also wasn't great or top tip for a 5* hotel. Wifi was very poor and it was quite frustrating at times. The quality of the TV in the room was poor. Definite room for improvement, a shame as hotel is a spectacular grand building and definitely has the wow factor. Location is great. Massive shame the new pool wasn't open in time for our visit either. The pool was a massive selling point when my partner booked the trip/hotel for a surprise birthday present. Manager did offer us a discount on our stay or a voucher for stay within the coming year. We chose the discount as were torn as to whether we would go back or not. Part of us would and part of us wouldn't. ",3,2015,06,10
29,Good hotel yet some still some improvement needed,"I stayed in this hotel with my wife only just last week. Doubtless, this is a very good hotel as many people has rated, very good location, very friendly, proefessional trained and happy to help staff, very clean room and well maintained interior both inside and outside the room within hotel. 

Yet, still there are some area I personally think can be improved. I do not know the logic of the policy in the hotel, I found the hotel only provide tea bags but no coffee bags (our room does not have coffee machine but only a water boiler), I eventualy have to ask for coffee bag delivery every day even I has put a notes inside the rooms asked for coffee bags every day in the first mornng when we went out for tour.

The second thing need to be addressed is the shower room, a little bit too narrow and not friendly to use. The shower head hose (above the bath tub) which connected to the wall were leaking the water badly. The nicht between two glasses of the shower are It would be a perfect and very happy stay if above mentioned were not happened.

The last is wifi, it was slow for whole 4 nights we stayed",4,2015,06,10
29,Excellent location and excellent service make for a great vacation!,"My wife and I just returned from Barcelona. We stayed at El palace for 5 nights. Everything went smoothly. Needed a band aid, they had one! needed an adapter for charging cell phone, they had one! Concierge always helpful. Very nice little cafe across the street for Nespresso, fresh OJ and croissants. Short taxi to everywhere from central location. Easy walking to Bari Gotic and El Born neighborhoods. 
No TVs in room but who needs one!",5,2015,06,09
29,In the heart of beautiful Barcelona,"When researching hotels in Barcelona and seeing the El Palace is a member of Leading Hotels of the World we had no doubt it would be a great hotel--and it definitely was.  Not only was our room ready when we arrived but we were upgraded to a Junior Suite.  It was a lovely room with a beautiful bathroom, very spacious and totally updated.  The main salon/bar was lovely and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Even though we had dinner reservations for all 3 nights we were there, and the fact we were exhausted from touring, we decided to stay at the salon/bar for dinner.  We had the most delicious fettuccini carbonara and a wonderful Spanish red wine.  The bar host, Miguel Angel, was so friendly and attentive and we loved getting to visit with him during our stay.  It was definitely a great choice for our visit to Barcelona",5,2015,06,07
29,"Beautiful, comfortable, excellent location","Wonderful staff. Will do everything to make you comfortable. We were upgraded to large beautiful room with two separate bathroom spaces. While there, I became ill and the staff found me a physician, pharmacy and was most helpful. Public rooms are elegant and luxurious. Enjoy a cocktail or tea in the very large reception area. Breakfast was lovely and the staff wrre terrific. Restaurant expensive with limited menu. 

Cabs are always available and inexpensive. Walking to shopping and tourist sights is easy and close. 

Best of all were the concierge and public relations staff. Always helpful with suggestions, directions, etc. 

Barcelona is a wonderful city and the hotel was exceptional.",5,2015,06,06
29,Delightful experience,"Beautiful, luxury hotel with it's welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable staff, located in the  historical Gothic part of the town with it's 7 minutes walk to La Ramblas. Beds are very comfortable, rooms are clean, the breakfast is delightful. We had stayed in El Palace with a group of seven, family and  friends and everybody loved it. We definitely will book this hotel in future.",5,2015,06,04
29,Yes! ,"Ultimate luxury in every way.  You cannot go wrong here.  It's expensive, but worth it.  You won't be disappointed here.  The location is really great and walking distance to good shopping and sights.  Across the street there is a nice bakery for a wick and cheap  continental breakfast and coffee.",5,2015,06,03
29,Totally Amazing,My husband and i were treated like royalty. We will definitely stay there again.The hotel had night time entertainment and everyone in the staff was a 10. The food was fabulous and our room was gorgeous with a jacuzzi.,5,2015,06,03
29,"When in Barcelona, stay at El Palace!","The personalized service you receive from the moment the Doormen greets you is just a taste of the experience that awaits you at this fabulous hotel. All aspects exceeded expectations including size of the rooms, quality of the food, and most importantly, service, service, service! The Concierges' (Idalija, Alex, Santiago, et.al.) are the best I have ever encountered, anywhere. A special ""shout out"" to Alfredo, the downstairs bartender who expertly crafted me my nightly Manhattan (maybe two....) before we ventured out for dinner!
STAY HERE PEOPLE! It's location is perfect for walks to Las Ramblas, El Born, Passeig de Gracia (shopping), cathedrals, markets, museums.........",5,2015,06,02
29,A grand hotel with many secrets,"We have just returned from a stay at the El Palace (formelry the Ritz), and for first-time visitors to Barcelona it was worth every moment. This hotel is a snapshot of a bygone era, constructed in the early twentieth century and catering to well-heeled guests for many years it shines in this busy and modern city.
Our room was a deluxe queen, and did not disappoint. It was large and well furnished with comfortable bed (ample pillows), a large bathroom with modern amenities (including the much loved rainwater style shower), and a mirror frame that was also the television. This feature was a hint of the many secrets within this hotel, including hidden cupboards and spaces, secret passages, a large yet intimate basement bar and live blues club, a large well appointed smoking parlour, and an outdoor meals area for a sumptuous breakfast.
The staff at this hotel can at times be a little brusque, yet we met a few notables. Our waitresses in the breakfast area and huge atrium lounge were attentive and always ready with a smile, the doorman was friendly and really helpful, and our personal favorite was Julie (the Guest Relations Manager). This young lady (and no she is NOT an American despite her acquired accent) really made our stay with her warmth, constant readiness to help with even the smallest detail, and availablility to chat at any time during her busy day. I feel we made a friend here rather than met a manager, and look forward to meeting again on a future trip. She even made the effort to come out and see us off with a last chat and a warm smile on our departure.
Located a little away (walking distance) from the beach and central shopping district, the hotel has great access to transport and the many tapas bars that dot the city. 
We would recommend the El Palace to anyone visiting Barcelona, and look forward to returning as soon as we can.",5,2015,06,01
29,Luxury Hotel,"After we docked in Barcelona on our cruise on the Silver Spirit, we spent 2 nights at this hotel. Very impressed. Nice modern room with king bed. Helpful staff. Located in middle of nice areas of City. Pleased with selection.",5,2015,05,27
29,"Service, Setting, Location!!!","From the moment we entered the lobby, we knew we'd be pampered and well cared for guests of this beautiful newly recently rennovated hotel. As Virtuoso clients we were immediately upgraded to junior suites -- beautifully appointed, large rooms with spa-like bathrooms and L'Occitaine products.
Continental breakfast was so much more than we anticiapted in a beautiful garden setting with wonderful staff who responded to every  wim. We ended every afternoon in the elegant common rooms with a sangria -- we voted the best in the city! Once again, the service was gracious, aware of our every need, but never overbearing. My husband was having leg problerms and our waiter slid an ottoman over so that he might rest it comfortably -- this is service. We relied on the conceriege desk for planning our daily events and they NEVER failed us from admission tickets, suggested itineraries to restaurant reservations. 
Location was perfect in the city center -- convenient walking distance to several sights. We would strongly recommend the Red and Blue bus tours to see the city from a double decker bus -- a grand overview of a beautiful city. Great tapas within a two block radius.",5,2015,05,27
29,Barcelona trip,"We have stayed for 3 nights in May 2015 and instead of a long and deatailed review I will sum it up as following: 
Location: good
Service: good
Rooms: ordinary, but room's size was ok,big bathroom, 32 inch TV is not big enough for the room size
As the hotel is situated on the busiest street of the city, it's very noisy, double window frames don't help. 
Breakfast: very good
Room service: should be avoided at all cost, food quality was extremely disappointing.",3,2015,05,26
29,"Great service, location and food.",My junior suite was delightful. The concierge was knowledgeable and helpful. The gym is not great but I suppose that it is not quite that kind of hotel.  The city anyway is a walking city with plenty of opportunity to walk about.,5,2015,05,24
29,Enjoyed!,"This is a lovely hotel. The rooms are large, the ceilings are high. I especially enjoyed the breakfast - the area for breakfast is very large and you always have privacy. 
Nice room service too.

Location - very convenient - walking distance from the centre. 

Wifi is not good like in most hotels to be perfectly honest. Even the luxury ones,",5,2015,05,21
29,Kick-off to our cruise,"We spent 3 nights here prior to boarding our ship for a cruise of the Med.  We loved this hotel.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly and quickly shown to our room.  I wasn't sure if I liked the room or not (we booked a privilege suite) since it didn't have a view of the city.  The Director of Guest Relations was happy to show us other rooms to see if we liked them better.  We ended up staying with our original choice since it gave us more space.  The hotel was centrally located and the staff was amazing.  Everyone bent over backwards to make sure we enjoyed our stay.  It's really a charming hotel (it used to be a Ritz Carlton) and we would certainly stay again when we visit Barcelona.  I remember reading reviews about breakfast being expensive, and while it is a bit pricey, it was lovely and worth the $$.  Concierge staff is knowledgable and helpful with great restaurant choices.  Highly recommended for a luxury stay!",5,2015,05,21
29,Very nice hotel ,"I love this hotel a lot, it's very good and comfortable hotel, rooms are very relaxing and pretty, I loved their breakfast and food was very delicious, staff are very kind and helpful, location is good too I walked every place I wanted to go, I love to go back.  ",5,2015,05,16
29,Majestic,I took my husband to celebrate his 50th birthday.I can honestly say it's one of the best hotels we visited. The attention to detail is like nowhere we've been. We got upgraded to a suite when they knew why we were there. Special thanks to Julie guest relations manager and Christina at the restaurant for their outstanding hospitality. We will definitely go back again.,5,2015,05,15
29,"Beautiful facility, fabulous staff and great location","During our 2 day day in Barcelona, myself and 3 friends, awaiting our cruise, stayed for 2 nights at the El Palace Hotel.  It was so comfortable and beautiful.  The staff went out of their way to make us happy.  The location was also great and close to the center of town.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,05,10
29,40th birthday at the hotel,"My husband and myself went here for 3 nights and it was amazing. The staff were so friendly and helpful, the food and service was excellent...and of course the rooms were out of this world!!! Would recommend to anyone especially if you are celebrating something special. Thank you to all the staff once again. ",5,2015,05,07
29,The best staff!,"While staying at this hotel for two nights Miguel from Concierge and also Julie from Guest Relations were kind, helpful and provided a very friendly service. My clients luggage was lost and Miguel helped me alot with getting my luggage back making various phonecalls, I am so happy with their service. Also Julie was very friendly and made me feel at home at El Palace. I was staying in room 310 and the lady from Housekeeping in the morning was also very kind and friendly. The hotel is very well situated.",5,2015,05,05
29,Amazing service & great location,"We stayed here at the end of July 2014 for a week for a group family trip.  The hotel staff made it very easy for us to book a group reservation via phone & email.  They also help with our restaurant recommendation, bookings and activities.  The hotel staff were very attentive to our needs.  The hotel itself is very beautiful inside and out.  Even helping us to change rooms once we checked in to obtain a better view.

The interior design of the rooms and hotel is very attractive and the rooms themselves are  spacious / wide and amazing.

We found the all the food in the hotel to be good from the 19/19 to the bar to their buffet breakfast in the garden.  The hotel's michelin star restaurant Caelis was great and definitely a must try.

The location of the hotel was so convenient and safe as it was close by Placa Catalunya and only two blocks away from passeig de gracia, which has some great shops and restaurants to try.",5,2015,05,04
29,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"Another exceptional stay at El Palace.
I only ever stayed at the Palace whilst in Barcelona and we will only stay here!
The staff here are amazing and will do anything to ensure you have a great stay.
The location is fantastic, the hotel is true luxury, we look forward to the new rooftop pool!",5,2015,05,04
29,Majestic hotel,This hotel is situated in the center of the city. Only 5 minutes from a metro and a 5 minute walk to Las Ramblas area. This is an elegant hotel with great service. The breakfast was very nice also. Wi fi was decent in the hotel. Our room was big in size by European standards and the bathroom was beautiful. Not cheap but worth the splurge,5,2015,05,03
29,Perfection!,"The very best hotel experience-loved, loved everything about e
El Palace and its staff! Wish I were there right now! Food, staff, facility-nothing but the very, very best! One of my very favorite hotels and would stay again, without a doubt!

29,Classically Amazing,"A beautiful hotel with classic heritage in the center of Barcelona. 

It was a great experience from the smooth check in to the beautiful and spacious room. The rooms have the classic feel about them but have all the modern amenities. 

The breakfast was varied and freshly delicious with great welcoming smiles from staff. The gym is a bit on the basic side with average equipment.

The Concierge was very helpful in getting recommendations to various locations and got us some nice bookings for great restaurants.

Will definitly return on our next visit to Barcelona",5,2015,05,01
29,Elegant and Classic Hotel,"We spent 4 nights at this wonderful classic,elegant and well positioned hotel. The entrance and the reception hall takes you back to an age where glamour ruled the day. The bedroom and the bathroom( we had a roman bath ) was very clean and the amenities of a good  quality,   The service was excellent and in particular the concierge desk is manned by helpful and well informed staff, who were able to assist with recommending good tapas restaurants, as well as booking tickets for the museums and train tickets to Madrid. This is a wonderful hotel, we enjoyed our stay and would return again.",5,2015,04,30
29,Absolutely Beautiful,"It's like staying in a palace!!! I felt like a princess!! The staff was super friendly, the bellman helped us catch taxis and spoke perfect English for us. The bar was warm and inviting, servers very pleasant and I LOVED the breakfast buffet. Fresh hand chopped fruit cups and champagne every morning. Our room over looked the beautiful streets, and the bathroom with ample closet space made me jealous I could not fit it into my suitcase! I love that the TV was disguised as a picture on the wall over the fireplace!!! What an amazing experience. I hated leaving!!! My ONLY complaints...the bed was hard. Like sleeping on a granite slab hard and no clock!!! Being from the US, the time concept was hard, and I needed a clock, not just my phone. Gorgeous place!!!",4,2015,04,29
29,El Palace Hotel,"We arrived at lunch time and our room was not quite ready yet.  We asked the concierge to recommend a nice place for tapas for lunch.  she recommended a place just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  It was amazing.  It was beautiful, modern a very different style of tapas place and the food was also amazing.  Another night we asked for a seafood restaurant recommendation.  Again, they recommended what the locals we met and talked with at the place, the top seafood restaurant in Barcelona.  Again the food was amazing and the service surperb.  I should mention that the El Palace hotel is very old style luxurious in both architecture and service.  You feel like you're in a special place.  The junior suite that we had was very spacious, and had recently been redone.  Bed and furnishings very nice, and the bathroom was huge, with large walk in shower, separate tub and double vanity.  Also with a makeup light!! yeah!!.  Loved this place and the people working there couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Also got us tickets for a great soccer game, and were very knowledgeable about hours of operation, when sight seeing attractions were open, would be crowded etc...They  always helpful and lovely. I will definitely stay there next time in the beautiful city of Barcelona.",5,2015,04,28

Conciergerie perfect!!!! Staff wonderful
Good rooms, big bathrooms, 
If you want to treat yourself in a classic decoration hotel in BCN this is the hotel!!!",5,2015,04,28
29,Truly an exceptional hotel,"My wife treated me to a wonderful birthday present of a weekend in Barcelona. We stayed at this gem of a hotel. We had a regular room which was beautiful. The breakfast in the conservatory was pure class. The attention to detail from the staff was amazing. As it was my birthday they gifted us a fabulous bottle of champagne and box of Lindt Chocolates.
The lady Concierge is a real asset to this hotel. Her knowledge of the city is first class. She recommended amazing restaurants for lunch and dinner. She would also arrange our entire day's itinerary.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona ",5,2015,04,27
29,"Stunning hotel, extraordinary service","The hotel's stunning interior is the first thing you notice when you enter the lobby. I mean how can you not? What a grand and beautiful lobby area! We were absolutely in love with the hotel. We stayed for two nights and then had to stay for a whole day because we missed our morning train to Madrid. You must have breakfast in the garden restaurant or tea in the room adjacent to the breakfast area. So regal.The room we stayed in was medium sized but the bathroom was the best feature of the room. It was so spacious and came with a turkish bath area too.

The staff were super helpful the two days we were there and on our last day when we had to stay for a few hours in keeping our luggage. They are extremely courteous. ",5,2015,04,26
29,"Unbelievably gorgeous hotel, wonderful staff, Doesn't get any better than this","This is an incredible hotel.   Do yourself a favor and stay here if you visit Barcelona.  It used to be the Ritz, and the service, ambiance and decor are absolutely in line with the my fond memories of the Ritz in our hometown.  I can't imagine a better place to stay in Barcelona.  It was within walking distance of most of the major attractions, very close to the Gothic Quarter, and had great dining onsite.  We ate a quick, late lunch in the restaurant and a great breakfast buffet.  Our only regret was only being able to stay one night.  We had a beautiful suite with a huge bathroom, huge walk in closet and sitting room.  It was incredible.  The staff was very personable, and took great care to address all needs.  In fact, one of the managers, Katharina Reschka, spent more than 30 minutes helping one of our travelers find a dentist which was open on a weekend to address a last minute dental issue.  She went way above and beyond to help us, and we appreciated her care and concern.  She also showed us around the hotel upon arriving, and gave us a great introduction to the hotel.  This hotel experience was 5 stars in our opinion, and we can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,04,25
29,Top comfort,"We spent one week in Barcelona and really enjoyed the hotel. Spacious room, caring personel, everything is designed for you to simply relax and enjoy the city.
The Spa is a must go.
One enhancement potentially: having coffee and tea in the room",5,2015,04,24
29,Beautiful but misses the mark on a few rhings,"Stayed for business.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very traditional and has a great dea of character.  If you want modern this is. It he hotel for you.  I have two complaints though:

1) the beds are not comfortable.  Maybe it's a taste thing but I found them a bit hard.

2) nearby there was a massive amount of construction and my room shook at times.  Not their fault but the rooms aren't cheap and I had to go elsewhere to conduct calls and get some work done.  They could have warned me and offered another room.

29,Historic icon (let down by some small details..),"El Palace used to be called The Ritz in Barcelona.  It used to be part of the same Ritz group as Paris & London.  Hence, El Palace is, by itself, an icon.  Yet there are some small details which lower this hotel to my 4 star rating..

The hotel itself is a ""must-see"" in this amazing city.  Once you enter the rotating doors you will enter a world 100 years past.  Much is as it was in the early part of the last century when this hotel was built.  The concierge desk has the key slots behind, the clock above the door is an antique, and the furniture has that ""grandmother"" look.  So even if you can't afford to stay here, you must visit this historic building of Barcelona (hint: Freddie Mercury & Queen first met Montserrat Caballe in the lounge!).

The rooms are partially renovated.  The bed, furniture, cupboards and carpet looks old.  The bathrooms have been modernized though we weren't sure about the rationale of paying more for the sunken roman baths (looked a bit hazardous!).  Overall feel of the room was a bit dark and dusty, though it was clean (carpets had some shoe stains).  Views are virtually irrelevant as this hotel is slap bang on a major road junction so you have to keep the windows closed to avoid the traffic noise.

We didn't dine here but had breakfast.  The breakfast room is truly delightful as it is bright and airy with a conservatory feel.    Breakfast buffet selection was adequate (even with some Chinese dim sum) but as you can order whatever eggs you wish, it's good.  There is a small outdoor area which is very pretty as it's canopied by large trees - a good choice for summertime.

Overall service levels in the hotel are high.  Most of the staff were ready to please/serve and this gives it a homey feel.  The concierges are particularly knowledgeable and helpful (there were always two at the desk at all times), and the friendly PR lady will explain everything to you in detail when you check-in.

I would have given this hotel 5 stars but for some small details, which are lacking.  For instance, when you enter the lobby you face a round table which could be the perfect location for a blossoming large bouquet of flowers.  Yet you will see several pots of plants with flowers in various stages of development.  It feels like an experiment in progress.. why not splash out on some water lilies or large Iris to create a happy welcome?..

Also, some parts of the hotel feel worn down.  We noticed some renovation work on the 6th floor where there was a large hole in the ceiling.  Also, one of the 2 elevators was not working throughout our stay which created a delay for travel up & down.  Most disappointing of all was the gym, which really is a small room with 2 jogging machines, elliptical, and 2 bikes.  Only the jogging machines worked properly.  I really don't understand how difficult it is to keep this in working order? So many travelers (especially business) nowadays need to workout...

Overall the hotel does feel a bit ""worn down""   For instance, when you walk past the outside, you will notice that parts of the exterior of the hotel needs to be cleaned and some TLC (tender loving care).  So, though this hotel is a 'must-see"" icon in this great city, it does need a bit more care in management, and attention to detail.  If so, I would definitely classify it as 5 stars on this website.

PS: forgot to mention that location of El Palace is one of the best in Barcelona! It's close to the shopping area of (Gracia), near many amazing restaurants (especially Manairo), walking distance to star attractions (La Sagrada Familia), etc etc.  Forget about the Arts Hotel & W (read my other reviews) which are way too far from anything other than the sea!",4,2015,04,20

rooms are very good and service is excellent.",5,2015,04,19
29,Very nice hotel,"We visit the hotel in 2014. It located in a very central location, walking distance to major shopping centre. The buffet breakfast is very nice among the five star hotel we visited, it even have some Asian elements in it, which is a nice touch. When we check in, the guest relation manager, she especially welcomed us and shower us the room. The staff is also very professional.

29,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Plus: Great Hotel, Great service, wonderfull breakfast buffet, good location, real luxury

29,Wonderful Palace,"One of the best Hotel I've ever seen in Europe !

Wonderful, well renovated, luxury and nice taste !!!

Ideally located in Barcelona, this hotel is just amazing !!! You have to try it at least for one night.",5,2015,04,13
29,Amazing service and beautiful hotel!,We stayed at the hotel for the weekend and absolutely loved it! Everyone is so lovely and helpful  with service at its best!  The location is great and the rooms are very spacious and quiet.  The food is very good and we thoroughly enjoyed drinks and live music at the downstairs bar.  A+ all the way around!  Highly recommend El Palace!,5,2015,04,10
29,"High above other hotels in Barcelona and most probably one of the best in all Europe, I have seen","My wife and I spent 5 days in el palace Barcelona (April 3-7, 2015) and although it might sound a cliché it was unforgettable wonderful experience.
The location is perfect –lively but honorable and safe, 2 minutes’ walk from Placa Catalunya,and Passeig de Gracia, or in the other directions straight  to Rambla and then short to the Gothic and old part- all around you by short walk.
The building is beautiful outside and amazing in side (much better than the pictures you see now. For instance, neither best hotels without mentioning names in London or Paris can come closer to it, in my opinion. You are really in a palace decorated with a delicate and magnificent aesthetic taste. The food ids heterogeneous and great. The rooms are  unusually spacious (advice: compare its area to what other hotels offer-a regular room is greater than a deluxe suite in  many other hotels).all taps ,sinks , showers water strength, heat, air condition, etc are I excellent conditions, no single thing to wrong. The rooms, as well the dining room and the rest are breathtaking in their beauty and luxury but efficient. Its very clean (cleaning done few times a day, without discounts including changing the sheets).The internet is very fast and free(no charge).
And above all, the staff is so professional, polite fast effective and eager to help. When we want an iron or a cattle for boiling water, for instance it took less than five minutes to have them in our room.
Special thanks to Julie Van Vreeswyk who welcome us with her perfect English, when we came, guided us so professionally and kindly, and gave us so pleasant and warm feeling.

If someone is asking whether this hotel worth any penny/cent etc., the answer is no: it worth much more than that…

29,Wonderful hotel,"I took my 18 year old granddaughter for birthday trip.  The room (suite) was spotless, the staff kept the room immaculate, the concierge staff  - no matter which one was on duty- was absolutely wonderful.  They gave us directions, recommended restaurants, and arranged our airport transfers.  The doorman (all of them) were courteous, watched out for us, and also recommended directions and restaurants.  All in all the hotel couldn't have been better.  Would highly recommend.  Also in close proximity to everything - walking distance to most all attractions other than beach but close to public transit.",5,2015,04,07
29,Best hotel in Barcelona with excellent staff !,This is so far one of the best if not the best hotel in Barcelona with very friendly staff and a very good quality facilitates.The interior design is very attractive and the room is wide and amazing.The breakfast is delicious as well. I was very satisfied with my overall experience and I would defiantly recommend it.,5,2015,04,05
29,"Great location, beautiful property",Wonderful property located in the heart of Barcelona. The rooms were a little small but well appointed. Breakfast was include and served in the covered patio. It had a great selection and was excellent. The staff was extremely helpful especially Alex and Francisco at the concierge desk. I would definitely recommend this property.,4,2015,04,01
29,A great experience,"If you want to discover a unique hotel, full of style and with a perfect service, El Palace will not disappoint you.

29,"Grand, comfortable, good location","Stayed here twice now.  Has a 'Grand Hotel' feel about.  Magnificent lounge area and really nice courtyard set up for breakfast.  Rooms large, nicely furnished.  Nice large bathroom.  Comfortable bed.  Cool bar in the basement.  Room service comes quickly even at breakfast peak time.  What more could you want!",5,2015,03,23
29,Maybe the best in town 😌,"It's a lovely gorgeous historical building .. Once I stepped in, I had to appreciate all the efforts made to transform the very old building - opened in 1919 - into a luxurious atmosphere. 

Accommodation:
Comforting spacious rooms, with classic european style.. Nice equipped bathroom, with a bathtub and walk-in shower. It's wonderful, isn't  ! 

Comments:
I would appreciate if there was some Catalonia hospitality, or a complementary service in the room, such as, a bottle of sparkling water, classy local chocolate/flowers, or fresh fruits, to match with the nice classy theme of the hotel.. 

What to expect!:
Great location, in the heart of the city, just few minutes from Gracia and La Ramblas de Canaletes. 
Nice smiley staff
Very comforting atmosphere at the hotel
Clean, quiet and good housekeeping
The gym is very tiny, not inviting.

Recommendation:
I love affordable luxurious hotel, this is one of them. It's my first priority hotel the next time I visit Barcelona.. ",4,2015,03,18
29,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Classic luxury with extremely comfortable rooms.
Top notch service from all members of staff.
We booked this hotel based on many positive reviews on tripadvisor- and were definitely not disapointed. 
Check in was easy and quick- just what we needed after a 32 hour journey. We got upgraded to a suite- which was definitely a plus. The room we were given was extremely spacious and well equipped.
The bedding was very lush and comfortable- perfect for good nights sleep.
Room service was available 24/7- with a more limited menu after midnight. 

Location was the highlight- we walked everywhere. Perfect for sightseeing as well as hardcore shopping. We dined at their Michelin star restaurant "" Caelis"" one night and were very pleased with the meal. ( We also found the price for their 7 course tasting menu to be very reasonable at 85 Euro pp).
Free wifi was available throughout the hotel.
Breakfast was not included in our booking- and cost about 28 euro per person. A bit on the higher end as breakfast was good but quite basic. We ate at the hotel on 2 mornings- but on other days ventured out to nearby cafe's which were all good. 
The concierge team were very helpful with giving recommendations for other nearby restaurants / tapas joints.

Check out was just was smooth and easy.

Overall a fantastic stay. Will definitely stay at this hotel again on future trips to Barcelona.",5,2015,03,09
29,"Spacious room, uncomfortable furniture","Formerly a Ritz (a fact you must tell taxi drivers, because there are about five hotels in Barcelona which use the word Palace), this is a hotel in grand Old World style. My room was quite spacious and quiet, with a nicely appointed bathroom. Unfortunately all the chairs and the sofa were just not well-designed, and I couldn't relax on them at all.

Breakfast was reasonably-priced, and there was a nice buffet spread.

The Palace is two blocks away from the bottom of Paseo de Gracia, which is a good location for most tourist purposes.",4,2015,03,05
29,Beautiful Hotel,"We booked this hotel based on many positive reviews and certainly were not disappointed.  This is a beautiful hotel with very professional, friendly and attentive staff.  They were very accommodating and we were able to check-in early which was nice traveling from overseas.  The room and the bathroom were spacious, comfortable and beautiful.  Our favorite by far was the beautiful breakfast area...

If we are ever in the area again, we would stay here again.",5,2015,03,02
29,Spectacular,"I booked to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday and I have to say we wasn’t disappointed, the facilities were spectacular, staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the hotel restaurant and Caelis (amazing see review) and drank in the Jazz & Cocktail bar. All this and Barcelona its self-made it a very memorable birthday.",5,2015,02,24
29,Perfect,"This is an awesome hotel, the staff are so courteous, friendly, helpful and happy especially Julie who was awesome! Nothing is too big or small for them and everything is done with a smile. The breakfast was excellent though sadly we never got a chance to try their award winning restaurant. The hotel itself is beautfiul, every detail has been looked after and it feels both warm and welcoming. I could not recommend this place highly enough. If you can stay here then its a must. It's also within walking distant of the old quarter, Sagrada Famillia, Casa Milá and loads of other attractions. When we return to Barcelona its here we will stay :-)",5,2015,02,18
29,Perfect Choice,"We stayed in El Palace Hotel for 4 days.
The service was excellent. All of our requests were regarded with attention and the hotel staff was also very helpful in advising us when going to touristic places (saved us allot of time).
The room was very well designed, comfortable and big. Great Breakfast. 
We had a wonderful stay. I highly recommend !!!",5,2015,02,18
29,Iconic hotel in a fanastic location,"With so many hotels to choose from in Barcelona, we selected El Palace Hotel for its size and location.  Spacious, well appointed rooms. Extremely helpful and attentive staff. Rein de Rein Cocktail Club downstairs is a great place to wind down with a G&T at the end of the evening.",5,2015,02,16
29,A true palace!,"From the minute we walked in, we felt like royalty. The hotel is a true palace. The design is magnificent. Rooms are spacious and very pampering. Breakfast buffet has a very large variety and everything is  simply delicious. very good location, within minutes walk from Placa Catalunya.
We loved staying here and would love to come back.",5,2015,02,15
29,Excellent,"We have just returned from a five night stay at this superb hotel. The attention to detail is beyond anything we have experienced previously. It was a special birthday for my husband and the concierge phoned through to the restaurant we were visiting on that evening to advise him of the event and a special dessert and candles had been prepared by the restaurant. Absolutely unbelievable. The breakfast was a little pricey, however there is an excellent cafe to the left of the hotel which was excellent baguettes and coffee. If there was one criticism I would like tea/coffee making facilities within the bedroom for an early morning cup of coffee. But other than that small point I could not fault this excellent hotel.",5,2015,02,07
29,Perfect,"We have just returned from a 4 night break in Barcelona, we decided on the El Palace Hotel for a special celebratory Birthday  trip.  We were not disappointed, everything about this hotel is special.  The decor, the facilities, the history, the food, the attention to detail, the welcome and not to forget the excellent, friendly,  attentive but discreet staff.  The chilled cava in the room upon arrival for my Birthday was a lovely touch.

We enjoyed a meal in the 19 restaurant which was very good, we chilled out and admired the surroundings in one of the side lounges.  We also enjoyed a night cap in the atmospheric cocktail bar downstairs and it was  facinating to watch the barman at work and learn about the numerous varieties of gins available.

The breakfast is on the pricey side, but in our opinion for the service, surroundings, variety and quality of the food we thought it was worth it. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved Barcelona and hope to return one day.  A huge thank you to the staff for making this a very special holiday to remember.",5,2015,02,02
29,Romantic friendly with good location - take your spouse,"The Palace is an old extensively renovated hotel. If you like the combination of a 100 years old hotel with modern amenities , this is a good pick.
The combination makes it romantic - it will earn you plenty of Kitchen passes...
The staff is very friendly !!!

Cons: Breakfast : Very expensive ! the coffee shop across the street (10 meters) is 10 cents on a dollar,
In room bar : You will burn your fingers if you just touch the door.

This is not a business hotel .",4,2015,01,22
29,They go out of their way to give a good service,"Classy hotel with very good service from everyone.  From the public relations manager to the concierge , etc..

29,A 5 star hotel,"Most definitely the option you can find in Barcelona. My wife and I had a great time there and Would definitely stay at this hotel again. In terms of service, quality, cleanliness and attention to detail, this would be among the very best places I can remember ever staying at. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,01,16
29,Excellent,Loved it!!! This is a beautiful and charming hotel with a perfect location. The interiors are beautiful and classic with a very relaxing atmosphere.  Service is top notch!  My husband and I had a wonderful time. I totally recommend it.,5,2015,01,16
29,Another Amazing stay,"It was just another amazing stay in this beautiful hotel, I am also in the hotel industry and this hotel is an example of how a hotel should function and how staff are supposed to behave towards the guests to the most minor parts all accompanied by a high-level, Breakfast was amazing and stuff has always a smile on their face, making fell welcome all the time. I am looking forward to stay there again during my next visit in Barcelona in February",5,2015,01,16
29,"Beautiful, charming, classic architecture","We stayed at the El Palace in Barcelona at the end of a three week whirlwind trip through the Middle East and Mediterranean, and so were pretty wiped out.  But, the hotel was wonderful - classic, old school style and rooms with updated appointments and top notch service.  Location is within walking distance of many sites or from an on-off tour bus stop that goes to other sites in the city.  For breakfast, if you don't want to pay exorbitant meal costs in the hotel, we recommend a quaint, reasonably priced restaurant across the street (left out the front door of the hotel), with some outside seating.  It has a friendly staff and good food.",4,2015,01,14
29,Charm and excellent hotel,"We were there for christmas and stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is really lovely, old classic, charming with wonderful decor..... must walk around in the hotel. Room is classic and beautiful with very good amentites.......

We had my buffet breakfast there in every day with extra costs in around 28euros person per day. Why??.......because we can got wonderful service all of the staff in restaurant, food delicious and many choices...... Especially compliments to Ms.Christina Sanz, Mr.Manual Bolivar and Mr.Leonardo Canchasto Perez, they did the best, outperform and wonderfully services to us in anythings, otherwise i must didn't breakfast for 3 days in same restaurant with extra costs for sure. haha.....

Overall, El Palace is a very good choice on my stay in Barcelona. Convenient... Metro, bus, Taxis and near Placa Catalunya.  Hotel... Classic, beautiful and charming. Services....Everythings wonderful.",5,2015,01,09
29,Charming Hotel,"Just came back from our holiday stay at the El Palace. We were there for New Year's Eve celebrations and stayed at the hotel for 6 nights (party of 3). We were kindly upgraded to a suite to accommodate for 3 people (we had requested an additional bed at time of booking). Hotel itself was charming, classic-ly old romantic. The room was spacious (bathroom and closet was big!). The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. The hotel staff was amazing. Friendly, kind, polite, courteous, attentive, informative, professional and made us feel so welcomed and right at home. They accommodated every request we had without any issues. Our wifi worked great. The location of the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Las Rambles and the busy areas. We ate at Caelis and room service and both meals were delicious. If I had to find a negative, it would be the pillows were small BUT - they left a sheet for us to request different pillow types. We were just too lazy to do it. Love the hotel and the people who worked there. Wish I was back there already!",5,2015,01,06
29,Fantastic stay!,"Very lovely old hotel.  We had a suite which was very comfortable.
Every employee at the hotel was extremely helpful,
most of all the concierge.  Every question was answered very
completely and they went out of their way to help us
have a memorable. stay.",5,2015,01,05
29,"Old rooms, low quality food, poor service","If you're looking for a five star hotel, keep looking. The Palace is not it. We were debating between the Palace and the Hotel Arts and very much regret our choice.

Pros: the Palace location (Given we were traveling in December we wanted to be close to the sites as opposed to the beach). The bathroom was modern and spacious and toiletries (L'Occitane) were nice.

That's where the good ends. 

- Room: The Junior Suite seemed old and not glamorous like the pics. Couch and carpet had some stains. No free water bottles. No dial directly on hotel room phone. We randomly pressed numbers until we accidentally got room service who didn't speak English and couldn't transfer us to the front desk. Dialing 0 doesn't get you the operator. Wifi very spotty and too slow to use Skype (kept disconnecting the call).

-Bed: Pillows are not down but are lumpy, thin synthetic filler. What 5 star hotel doesn't have down (or down alternative) pillows? Bed is hard! No down/fluffy comforter. Just a blanket.

- Bathroom: no washcloths in bathroom and toiletries were not restocked. We had to call every day for face/washcloths and lotion/soap. Toilet flush was half broken.

- Food: Room service menu very limited and includes pizza, fries, grilled cheese/ham, and yogurt. A yogurt costs 8 euros for 4 ounces of Danone yogurt in a plastic container with cartoon characters. Even the Barcelona train station had yogurt in little glass jars for 1.5 euros. This was a joke. The breakfast buffet for 35 euros had a very limited selection: no berries, same Danone yogurt in plastic. Eggs were powered, not real scrambled eggs! No English muffins or danishes. No variety of juices. Fruit (oranges and kiwi) aren't even sliced/peeled for you.

- Early checkout denied - we reserved on Booking.com for 2 nights (we did not prepay). The change policy is stated as no-shows and changes are charged for the first night only. After paying for the first night we told them we planned to check out (we wanted to move to a real 5 star hotel) but manager said she would charge us full price for both nights regardless of us leaving before checkout that morning. The hotel was not fully booked so they did not lose out on another customer. Nowhere in their policy does it say you can't check out early when you haven't prepaid.

- Concierge - the concierge was not helpful in booking train tickets to Madrid. He did not offer to book them for us (website was in Spanish so we couldn't buy online). He made us walk down the road to a travel agent. In Geneva and London (we stayed at
Four Seasons and Corinthia) the hotels were able to schedule car, plane, and train tickets for us no problem and delivered tickets to our room.

- misquoted travel time to train station by concierge made us miss our train and cost us $60 in change fees, loss of our first class seats, and an hour wait at the station. They said it was at most 5 minutes away when it took 18 minutes without traffic. The concierge said it was literally around the corner but it was actually on the other side of the city!

Out of the 4 hotels we stayed at in Europe this was by far the biggest disappointment and really affected our view of Barcelona. The poor food selection, uncomfortable bedding, and bad service left much to be desired. Thank god we only reserved for 2 nights. Take me back to the Four Seasons or RitzCarlton.",1,2015,01,04
29,Absolutely fab!!!,"We have booked this hotel for a romantic couple of days away just before Christmas... this has previously been the Ritz hotel... service was great and everyone attended us with a smile and curtesy!!!! Dinner at Caelis was great and so was afternoon tea in the hotel's main lobby...
Room was clean but the decor could do with a bit of modernising... classic doesn't have to be old!!!",5,2015,01,04
29,"Food quality struggling, bed and concierge poor quality, wifi horrible, poor management","What else is there to say? Breakfast was that of a 3 star hotel out in the outskirts of a foreign country. Yogurt was Danone cheap quality from 7-11, not consistent with a 5 star hotel. The pillows were low grade, non-down, cheap quality ones you'd find at your local Walmart in the 'cheap' aisle. Comforter - non existent. Wifi connection and speed was extremely poor. Bathroom was great - that was the one positive. Concierge said it would take 5 min to get to the train station - it took over 20, so I missed my train. And management was incompetent - making up rules that did not exist. Wait for a Four Seasons to show up in Barcelona - or get ready to lower your standards. Pay 5 star rates and receive 3 star quality.",2,2015,01,02
29,Just perfect in every way,"Complementary Welcome Champagne in room on arrival and Christmas day.
Breakfast was a great start of the day.
Staff better than perfect. and not intrusive.
Special thanks to Katharina Reschka, every request was carried out professionally and recommended various places to eat and visit, very knowledgeable and so friendly. 
Thank you.",5,2014,12,31
29,Great hardware but service is questionable,"We are on year end trip in a small group with 2 young kids so we are looking for hotel with good service, location, and safe. El Palace exterior is unassuming and in housed on the rather historical structure, the location is strategic, the interior is tasteful old world decor in the public areas but some of the guest room furniture is missing its quality (it is so off that I am not sure what happened there), the rest is just amenities that you expect from a hotel of this standard.  They have Caelis, Michelin rated restaurant and a bar in the basement.  The bar is cool but the restaurant is on separate review.

On our arrival around lunch time the concierge recommended a restaurant that was closed for lunch. It was a nice restaurant nonetheless when we checked it out later.  Some concierge staff are more knowledgeable than others so depends who you talked to, you might be facing some discomfort of waiting in line or missing the time slot in your pre-booked tickets. The front office people are quite nice but the breakfast is just so so in term of both offering and service (but all the hardware is nice if you are into luxury goods,  you'd be happy still), the house has not been kept clean it all our rooms to the point that we wonder if we need to wash our own glasses that we use for water and mini bars.  No worries, the beds are made and the mattresses are comfy.  

Anyway, I thought this hotel was managed by Ritz but it was not much compares to Ritz in Paris or some other historic high quality hotels in Europe.
",3,2014,12,31
29,Old world,This hotel was very old world - from the drapes and curtains to the amenities. We were lucky to meet a young lady (Julie) who was extremely helpful and loved to engage in a chat or a recommendation. She was brilliant. The breakfast was actually fairly standard - nothing special. We had dinner in Caelis attached to the hotel and that experience was special. I enjoyed the hotel but to be honest it felt more like a place for my Nana and Grandpa to be staying. Old world for the older generation.,4,2014,12,25
29,"""Work of art""","Back in the 1920's...

My first taste of Barcelona...
I just had an overnight stay on 12/20/14,few days after my birthday and few days after my long trip from Tokyo.
I have been fascinated with classical luxury...so when I discover El Palace,
I know it right then that I will definitely wanted to be a part of it's history.
So,arriving at the hotel after I checked in,I met Julie,one of the sweetest lady I've ever met.
She gave me a quick hotel tour from the grand lobby all the way to my room.
Plus!I got a surprise birthday gift...a bottle of wine and an upgrade!
So cool!

The moment I step into the hotel
I've wished of living there for the rest of my life...
Everything is a work of art.

29,Wonderful service,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at El Palace having booked it via the Leading Hotels website. 

On arrival we met Julie who had recently spent 6 months in Sydney and was excited to meet two Aussies. Julie proceeded to spoil us with her service ensuring we had everything we needed and organising a cake for my birthday.

We were upgraded as a result of the Leading Hotels connection and were given a very good sized suite with a bathroom that housed a Roman bath.  

The hotel has a lovely vintage feel about it and is small enough to almost be regarded as boutique. The service gives it a homely familiar feel that puts you at ease.

Caelis, the Michelin star restaurant, was excellent ( reviewed separately) but we were a little underwhelmed by the buffet breakfast on offer. It lacked a certain Wow that comes with 5 star hotels. The breakfast room was delightful, not unlike a large summer room that one might find in an old manor. 

We were given two recommendations/suggestions by staff that were in error ( eg, visit a museum but it was a Monday when all museums are shut) otherwise the staff were very generous in their recommendations.

We will happily recommend the hotel to others and would likely stay there again if we do return to Barca. 

Tip: join the Leading Hotels group before booking due to the benefits they come with it, eg, upgrades when available, complimentary breakfast ( continental) and an arrival amenity. ",4,2014,12,19
29,Old fashioned charm and sophistication,"The hotel used to be the Ritz so you can imagine the charm. It was as if my wife and I had been transported back to the 1920. The fine detail and lavish opulence has been perfectly maintained, from the elegant and guilted feel of the huge lobby and lounge to the wallpaper and ruffled curtains. The location is first rate and the gothic old town is a 10min flat walk. In classic old fashioned style the lounge area was bedecked with 4 huge Xmas trees with the lighting low key. Each of the fireplaces the same. Absolutely took our breathe away. Stunning and elegant yet maintaining a relaxed feel. Absolutely enchanting!! The slight negative was the room. We were on the second floor and the hotel is located on a busy road. If I was to return I would insist on a higher floor room to minimise the noise",5,2014,12,19
29,Top notch!,"“My wife and I stayed at El Palace in November, 2014.  The hotel’s rooms, lobby, service are all top notch. The bathrooms are palatial. What’s remarkable about the hotel are two women dedicated to “guest relations”.  Katherine and Julie enriched our stay. They gave us advice about where to go, and booked our destinations. When we asked questions they couldn’t answer they researched them and gave us the answer the next day. Katherine and Julie are El Palace treasures. Their ability, enthusiasm, and kindness made our stay at El Palace memorable.”",5,2014,12,17
29,Nice hotel,My wife and i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and had a great stay ! The staff are really good an efficient ! I enjoyed the downstairs jazz club where a blues band was playing that night .Real luxury in the centre of Barcelona close to everything .,5,2014,12,15
29,Luxury hotel,"Our recent stay was probably our fifth time here in the last few years; this time was for five nights.
If I have my history correct, this hotel was one of the original Ritz in Europe in the early 20th century . The hotel has been updated & has great wifi + other accessories. The El Palace is a true luxury hotel in a beautiful & fun city . We used the concierge a number of times & were very cordial as well as helpful. In addition we enjoy a morning jog & the doorman ( also a jogger) was very helpful as to where . The zoo is a short jog away & has plenty of trails in the nearby park .Our package included breakfast which was a large & diverse buffet . 
     We will be back next year !",5,2014,12,11
29,"Excellent service, quiet, unbeatable location","The staff here was excellent! From the concierge who helped us find great places to eat to the staff who helped us change rooms when the wifi wasn't reaching our room, it was perfection. They even set us up a bottle of cava and some truffles after we went through the trouble of changing rooms for better wifi (honestly, it was not trouble at all!) The lobby is a great place to have a drink and before heading out for dinner. And the location is hard to beat...smack dab in the middle of everything! And it was super quiet! It felt like we were the only people staying in the hotel even though it was totally full. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,12,08
29,"Ultra-plush, still warm and inviting","Conveniently located off Passeig de Gracia, (which is THE main shopping street in Barcelona) this hotel is the top of comfort and elegance. Being around the holidays, it is syrupy-dripped with holiday decorations. Three massive Christmas trees adorn the main entry / seating area, adjacent from a lavishly appointed bar. The restaurant is equally formal, luxurious, yet comfortable and has all of the items one could imagine from a 5* hotel. From the doorman, to the concierge, to the cleaning people, everyone is dressed appropriately, treats you with kindness and respect, and is professional on all accounts. One of the fun treats of the hotel is the Rien de Rien bar/club and cigar-bar downstairs - all equally appointed in richness and décor. Enjoy a fine spirit or cocktail, choose from a good selection of Cuban cigars and enjoy yourself in the private smoking room. Afterwards, continue with another cocktail and take in a live show in the beautiful bar immediately outside the door of the smoking room. Really enjoyable - a must see if you are in the area. Of course, all of this luxury is pricey, but no more for a hotel that is 1/2 this luxurious at a location as perfect as this!",5,2014,12,07
29,Very fancy,"If you are looking for a super fancy hotel with frosty stuff and in a convenient location it will be a right place.
Don't take me wrong , everyone is extremely nice and courteous there but we believe they are trained to behave a bit arrogant to match the gracious atmosphere. 
Doorman and Marat were exceptionally courteous but everyone else too.
Also, it's right ona busy road so it is a bit noisy.",4,2014,12,02
29,An oasis of calm and comfort in a vibrant city,"This is possibly the best hotel that we have ever stayed in! It starts with a warm and friendly welcome from the Guest Relations staff who show you the amenities of the hotel and then lead you to your luxurious bedroom. The decor is extremely tasteful, with old world charm and a spacious salon to relax in. The breakfast is held in beautiful winter garden and the choice is very good. Although it is near to all the amenities of the city, the hotel itself has a calmness and comfort which makes you relax as soon as you walk through the door. The staff are all very attentive and they all seem to make it their priority that you have a very pleasant stay. Absolute luxury!",5,2014,12,02
29,Old fashioned service,"Loved this hotel! It is elegant, quiet and very comfortable.We stayed for 2 nights and would have liked to stay longer. The room was spacious and yes the wardrobes are in the bathroom but it kind of makes sense as it is large, well ventilated and lighting and mirrors are good! Great toiletries, bathrobes and slippers. Only negatives about the room are that there are no tea/coffee making facilities and when we ordered tea on room service it was expensive, a jug of hot water, teabags but no biscuits! Breakfast was great but the real treat was the downstairs bar with live music where we spent both evenings after dinner. They take cocktail making very seriously and we really enjoyed the results, plus the gin and tonics were the best ever! The concierge was very helpful and his recommendations for restaurants within walking distance were very good. The hotel itself is well located, 10 minutes walk from the main action of the Placa de Catalunya etc and apart from an open topped bus tour we walked everywhere. To sum up, the hotel has a feel of established quality, comfort and service and we would definitely stay there again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,11,30
29,Best Hotel to experience Barcelona,"Elegant & stunning interiors .Great  staff , extremely helpful and courteous. Relaxed atmosphere . Michelin Star restaurant , jazz bar/ nightclub with world class entertainers. Rooms well appointed and large . Well located to walk to most major attractions in the City.",5,2014,11,30
29,Beautiful Hotel,"This is an elegant hotel in a lovely section of Barcelona. Our room was very spacious, the bathroom quite large with two sinks and a spacious vanity. There was a Roman tub with lovely tile work and a wonderful shower. L'occitane toiletries were provided. The fancy restaurant was closed during our stay (Sunday and Monday), but we thoroughly enjoyed the more casual restaurant. The weather was chilly and drizzly, and since we were tired from walking, we opted to have dinner there and were very pleased. The concierge desk was very helpful, arranged a car and driver for us which was excellent plus transportation to the airport. We would stay there and highly recommend it!",5,2014,11,28
29,An Elegant and Opulent Hotel,"Wow.....this hotel took my breath away and has now set the bar for all hotels I stay at in the future.
My husband and I stayed here two 2 nights after a western Mediterranean cruise. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty and there is so much attention to detail and anticipation of your needs before you know you need them! For example, I bought flowers on Las Ramblas and upon returning to the hotel, they immediately sent up a flower vase filled with water! I absolutely loved the decor in our room as I felt like I was transported back to the 19th Century. We chose the room with the Roman Bath on the top floor, which was absolutely heavenly. I would recommend this room as it gives you an amazing view of the gran via. I love fabrics and textures and fell in love with the heavy curtains and velvet/silk wallpaper. Overall, the stay was exquisite and I wish I could call El Palace my home!",5,2014,11,28
29,5 star treatment,We stayed 3 nights in El Palace and enjoyed every moment . The guest relations took us from the very first moment and they introduced the Hotel and the room.  The room was beautiful  with L'occitane amenities and rain shower was superb. I would like to thank concierge for all the patience to my endless questions and all the good recommendations . Breakfast room was in the courtyard with heaters and had a good buffet . They made our stay as enjoyable as possible .,5,2014,11,26
29,Excellent,"I travelled here for a few nights and found the hotel and service to be fantastic.

Many people do not know that the El Palace used to be the Ritz hotel. The rooms are lovely and spacious and we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival. This is a classic hotel, with classic proportions, and classic charm. If you have ever watched Downton Abbey, then this is a piece of that era. If you want a super modern high-tech looking hotel, then perhaps stay at the Mandarin Oriental or Majestic.

The hotel also boasts a Michelin star restaurant - CAELIS.

The location of the hotel is fantastic being just a 3 minute walk to Passeig de Gracia - the most famous boutique shopping district, and full of excellent Tapas and other restaurants in Barcelona. You are within walking distance of many of many sites, including Gaudi buildings, and the Rambla and gothic quarter,

You usually get what you pay for, and the El Palace certainly delivers.",5,2014,11,25
29,"Used to be The Ritz and is very ""Used to Be"".","A sad hotel.  Very quiet.  Very dark lobby/lounge.  The day-time dining area and where you have breakfast as also very dark and depressing.  There is a modern One-Star Michelin Restaurant but we did not try it.  

When shown our room we were told about the ""amazing"" fact that the TV is behind a mirror on the wall and that the decor had been retained in the ""old-style"" unlike so many modernised hotels in Barcelona.  You almost felt that they were trying to make up for the failings.  There are many ""old dames"" among European hotels that we have enjoyed - such as the Hotel du Palais in Biarrtz - but the El Palace needs a bit of umph.  The Reception and Concierge lack enthusiasm and even their clothing was ""has been"" and tired.  A disappointment in general.  We will stay elsewhere on our next visit.  I would, however, recommend watching the excellent bar man prepare cocktails in the downstairs snug bar which reeks of the naughty 20s and is a fun place to have a drink.",2,2014,11,23
29,Exceptional meal,"This is an old school hotel with excellent concierge and service. Most memorable was our meal at their Caelis restaurant - we have enjoyed very many fine meals over the years but for a combination of food quality, presentation and service this was right up there.",5,2014,11,23
29,My birthday treat,"My partner surprised me with a weekend in Barcelona and chose the best hotel. The El Palace is a stunning hotel, the rooms were perfect. All the staff were friendly, helpful and very professional. Perfect location to explore Barcelona! We didn't make use of the facilities as we only had the weekend and wanted to see what Barcelona had to offer. Great place to visit for a bit of everything!",5,2014,11,17
29,Classy,"What can i say this place is unique and classy very old modern and fancy. Tbe service i inpeccable by all means. The room is gorgeous and the bed slept like 
A baby honestly. Location you cant go wrong trust me 
Awesome environment.
",5,2014,11,16
29,Good in Parts,"We spent 5 nights at El Palace over half term in October and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our room was one of the nicest we have ever stayed in décor wise & it was blissfully quiet.  However it was supposed to be a suite and it was a little on the small side.  The bathroom was fantastic with the best shower I have ever seen & a spa bath which our daughter loved.  One slight grumble about the room is the pillows.  They give you a pillow menu but the pillows provided are very  flat foam affairs which were very uncomfortable.  They did provide better pillows on request but I think for the price we were paying, high quality  comfortable pillows should come as standard. 
The reception areas of the hotel are spectacular  & very welcoming.  Breakfast was rather disappointing.  The quality of the food didn't match the quality of the rooms.  The fruit looked as if it had been around for several days, every day, & the cooked food was very poor. 
The staff   were great and very helpful.  We had some excellent meals at restaurants recommended by the concierge. The location is perfect for getting around all the major sites.  
One final grumble though, the gym was terrible! Antiquated and limited equipment.  
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return but there were a few aspects that could be improved upon.",4,2014,11,14
29,Exquisite Hotel,El Palace Hotel is my favorite hotel ever! The room on the 2nd floor and bath were exceptional.  Shower was best ever in a hotel setting.  The old world feel of the lobby was beyond!  The concierge was very helpful at all times.  The best place to stay in Barcelona!,5,2014,11,13
29,Great Location and Excellent Service,"We stayed here on a family trip to northern Spain. We found the hotel to be family friendly, with interconnecting rooms and very good service. The rooms are very comfortable, well-equipped and quiet. The breakfast is excellent. The location is very convenient for all of Barcelona's central attractions. We had a hire car and the drive from the airport was very straightforward. Compared with previous stays at the Hotel Arts, the service felt more personal at El Palace and the location is better for central Barcelona (although not better for the beach/port).",5,2014,11,06
29,Excellent hotel," We stayed in El Hotel, former Ritz for three nights in November. It is excellent hotel, which I will remember for sure. Beautifully decorated with  and modern features, excellent location, great concierge, good sized rooms. I usually prefer contemporary hotels but I loved this one for  baroque charm of richly decorated main hall and nice rooms and modern features such as TV in a shape of framed mirror in the rooms and contemporary shower toilet facilities. Spotless clean, with great service",5,2014,11,05
29,Affordable luxury,"It was the third time we stayed in this hotel and we got for the second time an upgrade to a junior suite. The service is excellent. The breakfast buffet is extraordinary. The hotel is situated near a metro station and within a short walk from the Plaça Catalunya where all the sightseeing buses start - simply perfect. We will come again to El Palace Hotel and enjoy the service and the silence of this ""big old house"".",5,2014,11,02
29,Beautiful and Luxurious Hotel with Wonderful Service,"Very much enjoyed out recent stay following our ""empty nest"" Mediterranean cruise. The accommodations are superior and the staff could not be more gracious and attentive. Among our unexpected surprises:

  - Our room was upgraded.
  - Our room was ready upon our early morning arrival

Our reservation also included breakfast, which was excellent.",5,2014,10,31
29,Lovely Old Hotel in Great Location,"Customer service is a way of life in this grand, beautiful hotel.  It was our first stop in a ten day whirlwind trip through Spain.  Sorry we could only spend two nights there and one of them was the jet lagged first night of our trip.  But we arrived around 9 am and they had our room ready for occupancy, which as you know is a huge relief when you've spent the night in an airplane.  It enabled us to really enjoy our first day there, rather than having to go about in the same clothes with unbrushed teeth!  The breakfast buffet was delicious, bar drinks were generous, and they brought ice to our room both days at a pre appointed time.  Would return if in Barcelona again. Oh, and the room was lovely with a great glorious bathroom and comfy bed.",5,2014,10,29
29,El Palace harking back to luxury in a cosmopolitan city,"El Palace turned out to be a lovely old but beautifully renovated hotel in Barcelona. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. When we were there two excellent concierges were constantly on hand to recommend restaurants and sight seeing and a lovely Irish /Dutch young lady was so pleasant and helpful in a ll things about the hotel and customs of Catalonia. We got the reservation on Booking .com so we go a good rate . Actually excellent for a big city  luxury hotel. A wonderful place to call home in Barcelona.
The lobby,dining room were lovely if a bit pricey, charging extra for everything including bread and water but maybe that is the custom in that type of hotel. No worries though . There are plenty of places nearby to get what you need. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,10,28
29,Lives up to its reputation,"From the moment you enter the doors you are in the hands of excellent customer service. To me this means attention without being ""in your face"".
Our junior suite was lovely, OK the ""courtyard was more of a roof but the accommodation was excellent.
Clearly you are paying a premium for 5 star luxury but the best compliment I can give is at 5 star prices you do not feel cheated in any way!",5,2014,10,27
29,What an experience!,"We stayed here with friends for the first leg of our 18 days adventure through Spain.  We traveled with another couple and this hotel was on their bucket list.  Let me say it did not disappoint in any way.  We were met at the airport by their driver who was a delight.  He carried all our bags and showed us a quick glimpse of the city as we headed for the hotel.  Everyone in the hotel bent over backward to insure the best stay possible, from the doormen to the concierges.  Nothing was a bother to them, from cabs to dinner suggestions/ reservations to tickets for sightseeing.  The hotel itself is spectacular, from the lobby to the rooms to the dining.  We had Jr. Suites that were spacious and comfortable.  King beds, massive bathrooms with rain shower and jetted soaking tub made the stay a pleasure.  Oh, and definitely make it down to the lounge in the lower level.  They have a bartender there mixing specialty cocktails and serving top notch bourbons, scotches, and other spirits.  Very swanky!  We had the Sunday brunch and it was quite a feast.  Worth trying for the variety.
The location makes for easy walking to many attractions, shopping, etc.  we had no problems getting around.
Do not hesitate to stay here.  Well worth the money!",5,2014,10,27
29,Worthy of its Five Stars,"Beautiful and elegant in every respect. Excellent service, rooms, linens, bathrooms, breakfast. Our suite was very quiet, facing the courtyard. It's close enough to all attractions if you like moderate walks, even to the Boqueria Market (which is an absolute must).",5,2014,10,27
29,Grande Dame - an Oasis of Tranquility and Taste,"This elegant, well-located hotel (2 blocks off the shopper's paradise that is the famed Passeig de Gracia) was Barcelona's Ritz from 1919 until 1993, and it retains that brand's legendary spirit, attention to detail and excellence of service.  The Palace was renovated in 2009 to a good standard - our nicely-furnished, 2-room junior suite was spacious and comfortable, with two flat-screen TVs (1 each in the living and bedrooms) and a very large bathroom stocked with L'Occitane en Provence products and sporting a separate shower, jacuzzi tub and walk-in closet.  We were welcomed with complimentary bottles of both champagne and mineral water.  The bed was firm and the heavy draperies blocked all light, ensuring a good night's sleep.  Housekeeping came twice daily and was excellent.  Concierge service was first class.  Breakfast was superb - an impressive buffet for EUR 28.  The Caelis restaurant has a well-deserved Michelin star and offers an exquisite experience in a gorgeous setting.  Drinks in the fabulous grand drawing room were great fun and the surroundings transport you back to a more refined and slower-paced era.  We had a perfectly delightful 4-night stay and would absolutely return!",5,2014,10,25
29,Favorite place to stay in Barcelona !,"On our second visit to Barcelona we couldn't imagine staying anyplace else!  The service is exceptional, all the concierges couldn't be more helpful or knowledgeable.  We even requested the same room that we had during our last trip and they were most accommodating.  A wonderful location, easy walking distance to the old town (cathedral, Picasso museum, etc) and the newer part of town (Gaudi houses, shopping!).  A wonderful hotel, we will be back!",5,2014,10,24
29,Superb service in luxury setting,"We have stayed at this excellent hotel twice recently, and have been most impressed by the courteous and generous service. The Suites are very comfortable, well-appointed and quiet. The fine dining restaurant has a wonderful fixed-price menu, which includes several exquisite 'extra' courses. Location is good for central sights and shopping. No negatives I can think of, and we look forward to our next visit",5,2014,10,24
29,nearly gave up on the Spanish hotels until this one,"Our final city was Barcelona visiting Andalucian cities and Madrid
Luckily we got a room on the top floor-it was a deluxe room despite it""s relatively small size it has a big bathroom with separate bathtub and shower and toilet and also the built in robe is in the bathroom
also have a small screen tv hidden in the mirror-no real viewing just the basic english news channel
So despite the compact nature of the room and being on the noisest road it was very quiet
The buffet breakfast was good -it used to be a ritz property so it's a bit similar the one in Madrid-nice furnishing in the lobby to relax
They have a fabulous Michelin star restaurant but it's shut on sundays and mondays so we were just lucky to sample it's perfectness on saturday after arrival-it's certainly the best experience-a must in Barcelona
Finally a good value for money hotel probably the only one we had in Spain which worth what you pay for close to 5*",4,2014,10,21
29,Amazing,"Me and my husband spent a night in this hotel to celebrate our anniversary, our stay was wonderful and the spa was very relaxing, despite the hotel location is in the middle of a bessy streets but inside is very quite and relaxing.
The staff are very friendly and helpfull.",5,2014,10,21
29,Amazing Building ,A beautiful place in the heart of Barcelona near most attractions especially the old city which I really liked. Comfortable room and we were greeted with a bottle of champagne which was a very nice touch. It is expensive and we never tried the breakfast! The only surprise was is the extra fee to use the spa... Very unusual I never came across such a charge before. The light sensors in the room is also a nice touch. All in all a very comfortable stay not to mention that they even gave us another room so we can get freshened before we went back to airport as our flight was late at night.,4,2014,10,20
29,Beautiful!,"Ok. We travel allot and this may be our favorite hotel of all time!!
Beyond beautiful, spacious and luxurious!
The rooms are decorated with an old world feel. We had a fireplace in our huge (but standard!) room. Beds soft and comfortable as well as the linens. Marble bathroom was huge. 
The lobby, common areas and restaurant was stunning. 
Location great. Walking distance to everything.",5,2014,10,19
29,Perfecto!!,"They did everything right.  Warm and caring personnel that can't do enough for you.  The room was very nice with a small balcony.  Maid service was perfect.  Front desk was perfect.  Concierges were extremely good.  The breakfast area is beautiful.  The downstairs lounge which had live music was a lot fun and amazingly good.  Without a doubt, the bartenders in the lounge were the best bartenders I have ever seen.  It's worth your while to visit the lounge and watch them work.   Order one of their custom drinks (and video them making it - a little touristy, but you'll enjoy watching it).

Absolutely a 5 star hotel!",5,2014,10,18
29,"Wonderful, no doubting the Ritz past","There is no doubting, the influences of the old Ritz in this hotel. Having previously stayed at the Ritz in London, you can sense and see the little similarities of the previous ""brothers and sisters"" association.

Now owned by others, it was pleasing to see that the heritage of this hotel has remained. Its appearance is still grand, steeped in history, with lovely antique furniture in the main areas with a wonderful opening statement, as soon as you enter the hotel.

The staff are attentive and polite and whilst of Spanish background, most were able to undertake a conversation in English, if not, I was happy to speak to them in Italian, but that was of my choosing to polishing up on my italian.

I chose to book the junior suite which was quite spacious with a very, very large king size bed. It's furniture of heritage appearance, the bath and shower equally as spacious and was the wife impressed with the walk in robe ! Plenty of room, felt more like a classy private owners suite than a hotel room.

I enjoy my firm beds, but this one was a touch too firm for my liking. Maybe the old bones need a little softness now. Housekeeping was attentive and polite.

From a breakfast perspective, it was plentiful, fresh, and fulfilling. The cost possibly a little high at 28 euro, but I suppose it goes with the stature of this hotel.

Its location is ideal, all within walking distance of most sights and the shopping districts. A metro station  is close by for extended journeys.

After spending 3 nights at Palace GL, my only complaint is workers knocking away on some new air conditioning ducting they were constructing. I come from the construction industry and if I was undertaking the works, I would have undertaken most of it off site, which is not only more efficient, but a far lesser impact upon the guests.

All in all, I recommend this hotel, it may no longer be the Ritz in name or nature, but there are definitely some positive and historical similarities.",5,2014,10,18
29,Simply perfecto!,A gorgeous and historic hotel with updated and comfortable rooms (we traveled with two children under 10!).  We had adjoining rooms each with their own spacious bathroom and balcony.  The rooms were very clean and beautifully appointed.  The staff goes above and beyond to make one's stay comfortable from the moment you arrive until you leave...they even delivered to our room at 6am a gorgeous breakfast with picnic bags of food to take as we departed early to the airport and would miss breakfast which was included in our reservation...at no additional cost!  Will definitely be back!!,5,2014,10,16
29,Nice Hotel,"I like this hotel.We have had 2 connected rooms. One of them was for children and nurse and other - for me and my husband. Room in this hotel is small, but for us it wasn't a problem. We spent all our time walking beautiful Barcelona. Staff in hotel were  nice and helpful. Room service - high level!!! It was delicious!  Caelis restoran  - extraordinary, incredible and delicious place!   Great!   Cosmetics in the buthroom was L'Ocitane (my favourite verbena gel and soap).Pillows in our rooms were not down and it was one unpleasant moment in this hotel. Breakfast  - buffet with Cava, juices, jamon and many others tasteful things. Wi-fi in all hotel is free. For business there were computers and printer (I printed there boarding pass). 5 minut walking the street - BIG shopping area (department store (0 floor - supermarket with delicious jamon, butiques... 20-25 min walking in other side  - La Sagrada Familia (tickets for entrance you can buy by internet). For our family it was great hollidays!!!",5,2014,10,14
29,Unbeatable!,"We booked this grand hotel through the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" website and it did not disappoint.  We were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely opulent, including modern upscale linens, fine furnishings, with very large and grand roman bath with separate modern shower and double sinks.  We had a view of the Passeig de Gracia, but could not hear any of the street noise. Loved the blackout curtains as well!  The breakfast buffet was unending and delicious as would be expected in such a place.  We enjoyed champagne in the large drawing room and bar, as well as some fine vintage port after a couple long days of sight seeing.  The lounge downstairs did close a bit early, and they unfortunately had stopped serving food on our first evening but we did arrive late due to taxi error.  It seems there are ""several place hotels"" and our driver could not understand english or read and address. (HA!) The location however was excellent. Far enough away from the maddening crowd of La Rambla but close enough to walk everywhere.  The concierge was very helpful in booking museum tickets and restaurant reservations.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,14
29,Grand Hotel in every way,"Located in the La Dreta De L’Eixample district of Barcelona, this beautiful hotel, formerly The Ritz, is not described without good reason as one of the leading hotels of the world and we stayed there for one week. Quite apart from the impressive exterior, the ground floor lobby, bar, seating areas and restaurants are simply magnificent, reflecting the beauty of a bygone era. The breakfast buffet was extensive and would satisfy all tastes. The rooms are similarly decorated with taste, and contain all the expected facilities with the minor exception of tea and coffee making facilities. Bedding is of high quality. Double glazing ensured no street noise on the fourth floor and heavy curtains provided good blackout for sleep. The bathroom was excellent with a deep bath, good sized separate shower and also separate toilet and bidet. Hotel services were fully up to five star standard with a well-staffed and knowledgeable Concierge desk. The hotel is located within 10-20 minutes walking distance of a number of the major Barcelona attractions including The Cathedral (La Catredal), Antoni Gaudi’s amazing modernistic temple La Sagrada Familia, and the famous boulevard La Rambla. Highly recommended for discerning travellers.",5,2014,10,13
29,"Great location, excellent staff","I stayed in the hotel for 7 nights. The hotel is centrally located in Barcelona with walking distance to La Rambla (which is an over rated street ) and passeig de gracia, the high end shopping st. Hotel is well maintained with very helpful staff, the concierge was the best with helpful information and good restaurants recommendation. I highly recommend the Palace, I will stay there again in my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2014,10,12
29,Old World Luxury,"What can I say that has not already been said. We stayed here for three wonderful nights. We were treated like royalty. Everything was perfect, the room the amenities, the breakfast, the staff. Our suite was facing the busy gran Via des Corts street and did not hear a thing. Slept like a baby. The breakfast was one of the best buffets I have ever had the pleasure to partake.",5,2014,10,05
29,5-star BCN,"One of the top 5-star hotels in Barcelona where the actual accommodation is usually secondary to location and a desire to thoroughly enjoy oneself in a city that has not looked back since the Olympics. Writing barely 5 weeks later, one has already forgotten the details of the suite itself except for the views looking over rooftops to the phallic structure in the distance. Oh - a tad trivial but the toilet paper can be a better grade procurement people kindly take note. At the 5-star level, little things do matter. El Palace is central enough, luxuriously comfy and the public areas are quite opulent in contrast to the minimalist decor elsewhere. The one-star Caelis was a convenient and elegant in-house dinner.  Overall a satisfactory visit in a city with many good choices.",4,2014,10,05
29,Barcelona then and now!,"Barcelona was our last stop on our 6 week tour of France & Spain (5 weeks of which was in Spain) and based on TA we selected El Palace as a special treat to end our trip. We were not disappointed.After a little trouble finding it and driving the wrong way up a one way street, down which a police car was travelling, we were warmly welcomed (as opposed to the police response) and shown to our room which was on the 5th floor right on the corner with a fantastic view out into the street. We also lashed out and had our first Michelin star meal at the hotel's Caelis restaurant, which was an amazing food experience. If you read my reviews of our trip it might seem like everywhere we went was fantastic, That's only because it was, and that was mainly due to the time I spent researching on TA. This hotel was special in that it reeked of Barcelona's history, with Lorca, Picasso, and others. I felt like I had stepped back in time.",5,2014,10,04
29,An elegant experience,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful and elegant hotel for two nights.  Though notable for its Old World charm, the hotel was spotlessly clean and did not feel in the least musty.  Breakfast was very good.  Our experience at the gastronomique restaurant Caelis was excellent - we greatly enjoyed the multi-course Festival menu, with wine pairing.  This was a special anniversary celebration, and it was worth it.  The staff was friendly and professional.",5,2014,10,03
29,Luxury,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. The location was top notch, we walked everywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly and was great for suggestions about food and things to see. But the star of the show was the Roman bath inspired rooms. Such a fantastic bathroom. The room was also very spacious and we had a great view of the street. Highly recommended.",5,2014,10,02
29,Well located with excellent amenities.,Recently stayed there while on a Tauck tour. We were in a mid-grade room which was still quite luxurious. The full breakfast buffet was excellent and we were treated to a drink in the beautiful lounge when our room wasn't ready,5,2014,10,02
29,Excellent hotel with charm,"Hotel has very good location, few minutes to 2 metro stations, walking distance to La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, P.  de Gracia ( best shops ). Nice building - outside and inside - with great lobby sitting area and nice bar. It has classic decor ( it is a former Ritz hotel ) which I like and prefer basically but I understand if some people prefer modern design. We stayed in classic deluxe room which was spacy with comfortable bed. Hotel is very close to main street but thanks to soundproof windows the room was very quiet and we had excellent sleep.
I have to say hotel has very good service as well. Very quick check in and check out, very clean room and common areas, whatever we asked for ( adapter, ipad charger, kettle etc ) - it was delivered to the room immediately. 
I have to recommend breakfast as well: served in a beautiful verandah, big tables - so if you use more than 2 plates there is no problem at all which is not so common, decent selection, great quality of food and absolutely stunning service: very friendly, professional and ultra fast staff. Probably one of the best service I have ever experienced in breakfast room and I travel a lot. 
All together - I highly recommend hotel and breakfast. Without a daubt it is a top class hotel with great service. If you like classic hotels with charm - it is a hotel for you.",5,2014,10,01
29,Haven in the big city,"Step into the Belle Epoque and enjoy old world elegance and service. Well proportioned room with large bathroom (including shower and bath, and double sinks). Good storage for everything, except the suitcase, which I hide behind the curtains! Buffet breakfast standard fee only covers cereal, breads and fruit - cooked items are extra, but this is explained. Great location for peace away from the old town, yet withing walking distance of all the main sights and public transport. There is a jazz club in the basement (if you don't want to go out) with a cigar room.",5,2014,09,29
29,"Great ""old"" hotel",The El Palace Hotel in Barcelona is a luxurious property right in the heart of downtown Barcelona.  It was a perfect location that enabled us to walk easily to a beautiful shopping district as well as fine restaurants or outdoor dining.  The service of the staff was impeccable.  The rooms were large and comfortable and the common areas were beautifully maintained and welcoming.  The morning breakfast was an unexpected bonus.,5,2014,09,29
29,"Old fashioned, but high quality","We had only one night, but loved the location, comfy clean room and traditional decor. But high quality. Worth a longer stay. Nothing negative, and enjoyed the Michelin star caelis restaurant. Also worth going to.",4,2014,09,28
29,"Old school luxury, perfect location","Such an elegant property in every respect.  Appointments in the common areas and rooms are like a fine private home. Very close to Las Rablas and luxury shopping, the Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi sites and many restaurants.  Hotel and service staff were courteous, friendly and helpful.  Food for sumptuous breakfast and afternoon tea/cocktails was quite good.  Comfortable beds with pillow choices.  We felt well taken care of and very comfortable during our visit.",5,2014,09,28
29,"Great location, good food and service","The room was spacious and clean. The bed very comfortable with pillow menu, which we used to our choice.The bathroom was modern and clean with nice toiletries. All we needed was delivered to the room in no time. The only item could be improved is the lights. Too many switches and unusual activation. In six days we were still confused which one to use to put on a certain light. Also the toilet could have better ventilation, but shower and tub are great!
The breakfast was very nice and staff was polite , but not always efficient. I ordered a sunny side up egg and after a long time no show found out , that it was delivered to another table. It happened two more times, and the room was not so crowded . So go figure...
Location was absolutely the great. We walked every where and used the transportation very little. The concierge Alexis was very helpful and personal.Taxi are always at the door.
I wish the carpet in a main room would be cleaned of old stains or replaced . It was pretty dated for a hotel of such standing.",4,2014,09,26
29,Best Place to stay in Barcelona,"we loved this hotel. It is elegant yet comfortable, and combines old world style with updated amenities. It was also within close proximity to many sites, so we were able to walk to most places. The staff treated us like royalty.",5,2014,09,26
29,"beautiful hotel, great location, food","hotel is gorgeous! decor in the main lobby is amazing and the rooms are modern and chic. the bathroom was so clean, updated and spacious. it was a few blocks from gran via main street and from the metro. my only complaint was 3/4 staff weren't friendly. it was our honeymoon and i tried not to let it get to me until our last day, one staff member gave us the wrong direction to our tour office and we got lost and we missed our tour to see Montserrat. overall, it was a beautiful hotel, very busy and booked, but staff were a bit like most of Barcelona's attitude: anti tourist. the room next to ours, tv was so loud and on the second day, my husband had to pound on the wall for them to turn it down to go to sleep. i liked the free wifi. there was a great cafe and bakery right across the street",4,2014,09,23
29,Pretty Much Perfect in All Respects!,"This was the perfect hotel for our one week stay in Barcelona.  The location is actually ideal, situated within walking distance of not just Barri Gothic but also Gracia.  We found the hotel to be quite beautiful across the board.  We had a very well appointed guest room, and an amazingly comfortable mattress.  Street noise was non-existent.  The hotel reception area is large and quite grand.  The breakfast area is in a visually appealing covered terrace area -- the buffet is quite grand.  In the ""bar"" area there is a place for informal dining called 19.  We were surprised how good the food was and how reasonable the prices were for a hotel restaurant.  There is an upscale Michelin rated restaurant in the hotel which looked great but we did not try.  Perhaps the highlight of the hotel is the service - from concierges who were amazing in helping to set up arrangements before our visit , the the dining staff who were all very courteous and attentive, to the delightful bellmen / doormen who offered great advice with a smile.  Our only constructive criticism is that it seemed to take a while to get a drink in the reception / bar area - perhaps more staffing needed there.  When we go back to Barcelona, this is where we will stay.",5,2014,09,20
29,We were happy with our stay at El Palace,"Everything was perfect except at the end they forgot to bring our luggages down so we have to do it ourselves. Overall it was great... food was good, room is comfortable, services was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful. They had a summer special for a Mayan spa treatment. For $95 euros I had a 50 minute massage and it was great. I thought they had one of the best spa. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,19
29,Loved It.,"The Palace is a lovely building so grande and detailed. Just to sit in the lobby you could be entertained for hours enjoying the architechture. The room my wife and I shared was large and very comfortable. We were happy to be returning to the hotel every evening, in fact sometimes it was difficult to leave in the morning we enjoyed it so much. I would higly reccomend the hotel to anyone who is travelling to Barcelona. The staff were beyond helpful and incredibly friendly. I must mention a restaurant we visited whilst in Barcelona which my partner and I thouroughly enjoyed. It was called the Venue Steakhouse and placed on Carrer Casanova. My partner enjoyed the chicken whilst I had a rump steak which was of the best quality I have ever seen. Again, I cannot repeat how much I enjoyed my stay at the Palace and truely reccomend it to future guests.",5,2014,09,18
29,El Palace is a Palace,The El Palace hotel in Barcelona is indeed a Palace. There is no part of the hotel that does not make you feel like you are a guest in the mansion of a royal Spanish family. The entire staff is first rate. A special gracias to Celine Ferrie in the hotel Public Relations department. It is special people like her that make your stay there special,5,2014,09,16
29,One of the best Hotel Experiences Ever...,"This is by far one of my best hotel experiences ever. When we arrived they upgraded our room reservation to a suite (for FREE) without us even asking for it. The room was huge, comfy and beautiful The hotel staff were extremely nice. The location was perfect. The hotel was walking distance to the centre of town but was still away from all the noise. Good restaurants around...We stayed there for 5 nights and have nothing to complain about. Its was truly more than a 5 star experience...",5,2014,09,16
29,Excellent luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"3 night trip to celebrate a birthday. Very hard to make negative comments on this hotel; the best I can come up with is no pool, too many rich dumb Americans staying here, but no steaks for breakfast...",5,2014,09,16
29,Character!,"Stayed here for 3 nights, for my husbands birthday. Great location, excellent staff. Breakfast was ok, need a new toaster! Overall superb experience.

Would be excellent if there was a pool there, but was told plans are being made. Had a body massage in the spa, was like heaven! ",5,2014,09,15
29,Excelent!!!,"Food, service, location, all great!!
Wonderfull!! Breakfast is in a great and beautiful room!!
Junior suite is special!!!
All staff are prepared,from bell captain to manager!!!! 
You can go and feel how is to stay at Ritz!!!",5,2014,09,06
29,Truly a Palace,"My family and I just returned from a trip to Barcelona, Spain. We stayed at the El Palace which was a remarkable hotel to say the least. We flew in from Canada on a long flight and our room was ready before the actual time, which was very nice. When entered our room we were taken back to how wonderful it was.. and most of all quiet!! We looked out our window opened the door and found the street to be bustling and loud, but when we closed out door.. ahhh. it was quiet. The room had everything that we needed and then some. Very modern which is quite different from the look and feel on the front lobby. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. The location was perfect. we could walk to the busy tourist areas or just make our own way in the back areas.  We have already recommended this hotel to many!",5,2014,09,05
29,Absolute Luxury,This hotel is truly a palace like it's name.  The public areas are quite grand as well as relaxing and comfortable.  The rooms are extremely clean and stylish with many amenities.  Breakfast was included and was perfect for my family of 5.  The location was central to many attractions within walking distance.  'Would definitely recommend this hotel!,5,2014,09,02
29,Comfort and Luxury,"A most relaxing and comfortable ""grand"" hotel with just 125 rooms in a fabulous, stylish city.  We stayed in a junior suite which was of generous proportions and very well appointed. The public areas were perfect and the food good although the Michelin starred Caelis restaurant was a little disappointing. The hotel is right in the city centre as is in walking distance from most things.  We would not look anywhere else if visiting Barcelona again.",5,2014,08,31
29,Treated Like Royalty at The Palace,"We loved absolutely everything about The Palace. It has a great location, minutes from anything you might want to see, charm, and outstanding service. You enter an elegant, beautifully maintained lobby and you're in the past--a time of quiet, calm and exquisite taste. The rooms are beautiful and I was upgraded (thanks, Leaders Club!) to a Junior Suite with couch, chairs, and two bathrooms (separate shower) with a total of three sinks for two people. Lovely! Caelis (separate review) was outstanding for lunch and the buffet breakfast, served in an airy and lovely room was excellent--the food delicious and copious. One doesn't expect a server at a buffet to bring a bottle of water right to your table, but one did just that. Much appreciated. You can eat inside or outside and we did both. Katharina, of Guest Relations made us feel at home and especially welcomed, offering her help if needed. I would never stay anywhere else in Barcelona, and so appreciate the reviewers whose Tripadvisor words I'd read before booking. If you stay here, you are in for a treat.",5,2014,08,30
29,Did I die and go to heaven?,"The rooms are updated and very well appointed. Mine had a small fireplace although it was too hot outside to see if it worked, but it was wonderful ambiance with a large chair comfortable chair beside it. I could live here. Beautiful large bathroom. It had both a great shower and tub. Large window that opened up to get a view of the city.Toiletries are wonderful. Just the right amount of scent. Very clean, great maid service.  The lobby is very opulent and elegant and it is fun to sit in there and imagine you are living in a place. The bar is a prefect place for the best chicken Caesar 
Salad and a chilled bottle of  wine. I also tried the salmon with asparagus, it was cooked to perfection. Breakfast  was the best in my 18 days in Spain.  Very fresh with lots of wonderful selections. I was treated like a Queen at the Palace.",5,2014,08,29
29,Great Hotel,"We loved this hotel.  Walkable to many things in the city.  Hotel was clean, food was good, service was exceptional!  20 minutes from the airport.  Can walk to many restaurants.  We loved Barcelona.  Don't forget to go to Sagrada Familia.",5,2014,08,24
29,Definitely a top notch hotel,"This hotel is great. The staff is friendly, accommodating and speak several languages. The entire hotel is striking. The rooms are large and very comfortable.  They have a great bar/lounge area in the basement with live music on certain days, which is worth a trip.  They also have a restaurant in the hotel which you must check out for their signature desert called Explosion something (can't recall the exact name). It's amazing and probably the most unique desert you will ever have. Definitely worth a try, although I would not recommend it for the food itself, which was just OK in my opinion.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I am in Barcelona.",5,2014,08,22
29,A Classic and Classy Hotel,"From the beautiful lobby to the spacious rooms, this place exudes class. The entire atmosphere is really lovely. Somehow they have managed to maintain the old world regal nature of the hotel without the stuffiness.  
Breakfast is served in a lovely light airy room that opens to the outside. Service is excellent.

I cannot say enough about the concierge staff. We interacted with three off them who were always helpful and charming.  Alexis in particular was extremely helpful. Unfortunately my husband's wallet was stolen on the subway by a skilled pickpocket. Alexis helped us contact our credit card companies etc. and showed genuine concern for our situation.

If you are going to Barcelona, this is really a great hotel in which to stay.",5,2014,08,22
29,Worthy!,"It was our first trip to Barcelona. Our agent at worldview travel recommended El Palace hotel to us. We stayed in the hotel for a week in July. 
The hotel is near the shopping district. We arrived at the hotel around noon and had to wait for our room. As we waited in the hotel lounge, we were greeted by the hotel manager, Celine. We were offered drinks on the house.  She was able to get us to our room earlier than the usual check in time and personally walked us to our room. 
The room was standard in size. But the bathroom is spacious with plenty of storage. The fresh stargazer lilly was a special touch. It lasted a few days and was later replaced by carnations. 
There was a pillow menu for us to choose from. The toiletries are by L'Occitaine, a personal favorite.  The supply was ample and was replenished daily. We need not ask for more ;)
Room service was so so. Nothing special, no added special treatments. One time, they were so busy that a restaurant server had to bring our food to us. He didn't seem happy about it. There was no room for tips on the bill so we gave cash tips. 
The breakfast room is grand!  Selection was diverse and in very good quality. I suggest to go down for breakfast and skip the room service. The choices for the breakfast room service is limited if you are on the breakfast plan.  
We were provided a bottle of water in our room daily. Had a box of Lindt chocolates (a few truffles) left for us the first night. This was aside from the daily chocolate treats on our pillows at turn down. 
Celine surprised our son with gifts!  This just made our son's week and he will remember our stay in El Palace even more ;) 
Thank you, El Palace for this fabulous experience.  You are worthy of the name! 
",5,2014,08,19
29,El Palace Hotel ..... The Unique Palace,"What an impressive experience we had for the second time in this magnificent property. The service and the place show to every guest an incredible atmosphere that will make you feel a truly experience in Barcelona. Let you guided by the guest relation, the concierge and especially Katharina who will prepare all you need during your stay, they know perfectly what you want and will make you feel at home at any moment. Thank you very much El Palace Hotel and see you for an other memorable stay soon.",5,2014,08,18
29,"Good experience, old world charm","Wonderful hotel with old world charm, just up the road from the main retail area and gothic quarter.  Rooms are very well appointed, staff attentive and the lounge and breakfast areas are extremely well managed and lovely to sit in.  One negative item is that the 'gym' is a small room with outdated running and step machines (only 4). This needs an upgrade.
All in all a good experience.",4,2014,08,18
29,A Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here with our family of four for one night before departing on a cruise ship.  Old school hotel without the stuffy atmosphere.  From the moment we arrived my family was treated like a royal family.  Although the room was not yet ready (we arrived around 1:00 p.m.) we were taken to the bar area and given free drinks.  The room was tight for four but still excellent.  The best part was the bathroom -- brand new, spacious and better than the best five star hotel bathroom.  A few worn carpet areas is the only ""complaint"" but what do you expect with this old of a hotel.  Great shopping within 5 minutes walking.  Would definitely stay here again if I travel back to Barcelona.",5,2014,08,16
29,Great hotel,"I like this hotel, spacious rooms, large bathroom, great location, few steps to shopping area&ramblas, the staff are nice. Classic hotel, its nice for singles & couples, its one of the best hotels in barcelona. ",5,2014,08,16
29,Excellent location!,Stayed here for a few nights while exploring Barcelona.  The location is supurb and the room was clean.  Restaurants were excellent.  Nearly everything in the historic quarter of Barcelona is within walking distance.,5,2014,08,12
29,A real Palace in Barcelona!,"The palatial El Palace is gorgeous with the most well done lobby ever! The location is just a 8 minute walk from the busy Plaza Catalunaya, where all the action is. The hotel comes to life with the excellent staff which was very warm and helpful each time we asked for assistance… Special mention to the ever smiling door man and the superb Concierge :). The room are luxurious with all the basic amenities in it. Loved the tv frame on top of the fire place which when not in use looked like a ornate mirror and when switched on turned into a tv :). Also the bathrooms were perfect with all the L’Occitane toiletries. The breakfast was served in a lovely veranda kind of a place with a solid canopy covering it.. and wow!! what a delectable spread… the waffles are one of the best we have ever had, as were the mini burgers and the cappuccinos! Roofing a Michelin Star restaurant does surely show its charm on the breakfast table. The hostesses were friendly and greeted us each morning with genuine warmth. All in all enjoyed the morning breakfast a lot! The free wifi is a blessing but was a hit and miss in the room… sometimes the connection was perfect, sometimes bleak. We had a front facing room on the 1st floor but were never disturbed by any street noise at any point of time. Taxis were freely available at anytime from the hotel entrance… The Leading Hotel of the World most defiantly showed its charm…We loved the old world charm and we shall be back for sure!",5,2014,08,11
29,What a treat!!!!,"Old world opulence with all the trimmings of today's modern world. Impeccable service from top management to porter, large rooms with decor fit for a palace. Location was perfectly placed, and very convenient for shopping or exploring. I'm thrilled we chose to end our 2 week Spain adventure here for 3 nights.",4,2014,08,10
29,Central hotel,"Great hotel very central to the shops and centre of Barcelona 
Rooms are nice not large but big enough
Bathrooms v nice 
Service is excellent 
Spa is amazing 
We ate out as it was nice to go out in the sun and have yr meals",5,2014,08,09
29,The Best Hotel Ever!,"Our stay at the El Palace was delightful from start to finish.  The staff could not be more helpful and pleasant.  The lobby is beautiful and our room, facing the Gran Via, was lovely in every way. The location was convenient to everywhere we wanted to go for exploring and eating.  I would recommend this hotel to the most discerning travelers.  You will not be disappointed!",5,2014,08,06
29,Our absolute favorite hotel,"Everything about this hotel is truly exceptional.  It is located conveniently close to Placa Catalunya, shopping, the Gothic section and wonderful dining.  From the moment we arrived, no matter who we encountered, the staff could not have been more helpful, pleasant and engaging.  The hotel itself is wonderfully appointed.  The first floor lounge is beautiful and we always looked forward to relaxing both there and in our room after a day of exploring Barcelona.  Our room itself was tastefully decorated and the shower was perhaps the nicest I have ever found in Europe.  We really enjoyed Barcelona, but I have no doubt that we will revisit just to stay at the El Palace again.  This is our favorite hotel in Europe.",5,2014,08,02
29,Very helpful staff,"This hotel is located in an area close to most of the tourist attractions, without being right in the heart of the hustle and bustle. We arrived late at night and to be honest I was a little bit concerned but I should not have been, the staff wee helpful from the off and once we had dropped off the gas we set off for a recommended tapas bar, which was excellent. All of this happened at around midnight!
As to the hotel itself, the room we had was very nicely appointed and spacious, a decent TV, plus a really good bathroom with all facilities. There was free wifi too and a strong connection.
We did not sample the breakfast so I cannot comment on that, neither did we avail of any of the other facilities so again it would be wrong for me to comment. On that basis I have only given a 'very good' rating but it is borderline 'excellent' even then.",4,2014,08,02
29,A true palace,"Its been a while since my last trip to Barcelona so it took me some time to decide which hotel would be best for my this trip.   I was impressed by the TripAdvisor comments and ratings and decided to book hoping for the best.   I was completely blown away by this hotel.    It is better than 5 stars.  The lobby, the restaurant on the patio and the downstairs jazz and cigar lounge are breathtaking.    The room was spacious, modern with a huge closet and bathroom and we just had a deluxe room.   The location is great and away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla but an easy walk to all the sights and the waterfront.   I suggest using UBER while in Barcelona it works like a charm and cheaper and more efficient than Taxi's.   Book this hotel and you too will feel like you have the keys to the Palace.",5,2014,07,31
29,Wonderful Stay,"El Palace is a wonderful hotel - well located, well maintained. Our room was large and the bathroom was well lit and modern. Breakfasts were good with lots of choices and the service was first rate. The only issue I have with the hotel was that they did not provide bottled water in the room. Every other 5 star hotel we stayed at did and this was a bit of a surprise. Aside from this, El Palace is a first rate hotel.",4,2014,07,23
29,Excellent,"We stayed at the El palace for 5 nights with our 3 children , I would recommend this hotel and I would definitely return . Outstanding service and very clean 5 star hotel.the location was perfect just away from the maddening crowds",5,2014,07,22
29,Fantastic Hotel with Fantastic Service,"My husband and I travelled to Barcelona for our Birthday present to each other. So we wanted an extra special Hotel and the El Palace delivered on all counts. We stayed here between 15-18 July 2014. The El Palace was previously known as The Ritz and the plaque on the floor is still there. We arrived quite early in the morning and so our room wasn't ready (which we expected) but the desk staff couldn't have been apologetic enough, our bags were held for us and they promised to have the room done within an hour and half, and they did. The room (which was more like a mini suite) was beautiful with a walk in dressing room/bathroom. The bed was huge and comfortable. The bathroom had a huge shower a bath and double basins and they provided l'occitane products which were replenished every day if needed. I cannot praise ALL the staff enough from the Doorman to the Reception to the Bar to the Maids. Everyone always had a smile for you and nothing was too much trouble. They certainly made our stay in Barcelona extra special.",5,2014,07,20
29,Old world charm,"I truly enjoyed staying at this hotel , which is locate don GRANVIA which is like almost like a 10-15 minute walk to LA RAMBLA. This hotel is best suited for guests who appreciate gourmet food than fast food ! It was built in 1919 and they have been successful in maintaining the look and the style , which nowadays most hotels do forget to cater to. The breakfast is a MUST , just to sit at the black and white restaurant with chandeliers , marble and outdoor canopy seating . If you want to live in chaos than stay in a hotel located in LA RAMBLA where all the activity is . But if you want to enjoy your stay peacefully then this is worth it.",4,2014,07,18
29,Construction going on here- spend your $$$$ elsewhere!,"This is the last of our stays in Spain and it ain't no Langhams, Penninsula or the Ritz. If you are from Australia or America you will be disappointed. The most courteous person here is the American porter as you arrive ( he's lived here for 14 years). 

The service in the lobby is average. The wine list is poor. 
But the noise!! Construction from at least 9am-7:30pm. And it will be going on for quite some time to come. We've been moved twice and upgraded but it's still loud.
This is an old hotel. And yes old world charm but also old! The doors don't shut well, the mattresses are tired, etc etc. everything has been minimised from no face washers in rooms to no bottled water to no tissues even. It's not a palace, it's just an old Ritz that got sold on. Spend your hard earner $$$$ elsewhere. There are better choices.  ",3,2014,07,17
29,"Great hotel, great location and great service",My husband and I spent 4 nights in Barcelona this past June.  Everything about the hotel was first rate.  Our room was quiet and spacious.  It had all the amenities that you would expect in a 5 star hotel.  The concierge staff was extremely helpful with directions and making dinner reservations for us.  The included breakfast was very good and offered buffet as well as eggs to order.  The ambiance of the breakfast dining room was lovely.  We enjoyed our stay there very much.,5,2014,07,16
29,Beautiful hotel in great location,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the palace hotel in Barcelona . The hotel is very elegant and beautiful. We were welcomed upon arrival and although it was early, our room was ready. The concierge was very helpful in recommending restaurants, sightseeing and arranging a car and driver for one trip. They showed us on the map where we were located and how best to get around. Katerina, one of the managers, made a point to introduce herself and sent us champagne and fruit to our room, since we are members of the leading hotels of the world. The buffet breakfast was good and served in a beautiful room or in the garden.  Our only complaint was that if we wanted one section of the buffet which included eggs and a few other hot items, it was an extra 14 euros per person which is high for eggs. The rest of the buffet was included. We could pretty much walk to most tourist attractions. We would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel and excellent staff!",5,2014,07,12
29,Superb,"The El Palace Hotel is the Old Ritz hotel and the style of the hotel is very grand, beautiful chandeliers everywhere and the stair case in the lobby is very grand.
 At the check in we were greeted with friendly service and the room key was issued by the Concierge in the main lobby of the hotel. We had room 210 which was on the corner of the hotel overlooking the street. The room was very quiet with excellent black out drapes. Even though the room faces the street, the windows have excellent double seals which block out all the street and traffic noise. We slept without any disturbance during our 5 nights in Barcelona. The room was quite spacious with a writing desk and king size bed and with a large wardrobe, which was in an adjoining room. The bathroom had a full size bath with a separate walk in shower, single vanity and a separate toilet in the corner of the bathroom behind a glass door. There is an entry hall from the room door into the bedroom area which has sensor lights which help light your way at night.
We opted to pay for breakfast which was about 28 euros which sounded expensive, until we checked out the prices at a nearby restaurant. Once we added up the items we would have with tea and juice etc., it worked out much the same price and much easier at the hotel. At breakfast there was a very good selection of fruits, cereals, pasties, breads, hot foods etc. You can order an omelette or poached eggs if you wish. The breakfast staff are very accommodating and nothing is too much trouble.
The hotel’s location is very good and central to the main tourist sites in the main centre of Barcelona with the metro stations only a short walk away. The cost of the hotel is a bit more, but it is worth spending the extra. 
We highly recommend the El Palace Hotel for your stay in Barcelona",5,2014,07,09
29,Now this is a hotel!!!,"El Palace knows how to treat their customers. From the moment we arrived we were pampered. Each and every staff member is attentive but not overbearing. Every request we made was addressed promptly. The concierge services, as well as all the other services, were exemplary. The hotel itself is beautiful and immaculate. Even our late lunch the day of our arrival was fantastic, although we're not sure if we enjoyed the food or the service more. Whenever we are in Barcelona we will absolutely be staying at El Palace.",5,2014,07,08
29,One of the Best,"Booked a long weekend here due to the reviews on trip advisor 
Maybe one of the best hotels I've stayed in, great friendly staff, great location, with very plush surroundings 
Go for the breakfast option, you pay a little more but well worth having breakfast - sets you up for the busy day ahead
The only thing I would criticise is the Wi Fi signal in the room, but that's it 
4 nights in a Wonderful City, in a Fantastic Hotel 
Would go back here in an instant",5,2014,07,08
29,Absolutely superb,"We spent three nights in the hotel as a treat and can only describe it as faultless. The staff were extremely helpful without being intrusive and the rooms superb. Yes, expensive, but great value.

The hotel has retained all of its former glamour and a great way to spend a long weekend. ",3,2014,07,08
29,Classiest stay ever!,"The lobby of the hotel will definitely leave you breathless. It's like living to a palace. The title of the hotel cannot be more representative of what you will see. The breakfast is one of the most diverse I have ever tasted. Of course, it's pricey but you have to take it at least for one day. The rooms are big enough, we stayed at a junior suite. The best part of the room was the extra spacious bathroom. The view was to the inside part of the hotel-nothing particular. Walking distance to the Casa Battlo and to the central square.",5,2014,07,07
29,excellent hotel!,"We arrived in the morning and our room was ready, so we took advantage of having a few hours resting in our beautful, spacious  room!  The best linens and towels in a spacious marble bathroom.    The inviting lobby is adorned with luxurious couches , chairs, tables and chandeliers.  The staff, concierge  and front desk  are first rate and very helpful.
    The dining room is beautifully decorated, just off the lobby.  Food and service excellent.  I must say,  the bar tender made the most generous gin and tonic, poured at tableside that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.  
   The location is excellent for walking the city and shopping.",5,2014,06,30
29,Outstanding hotel,"Grand and old style hotel, but in excellent condition and supported by a wonderful and able staff. Location is good...betwixt and between so many of Barcelona's best places to tour. The care and attention of the staff is outstanding. The lounge/lobby and the breakfast room are impressive gathering places. We were upgraded to a suite...tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean, quiet.
Impressive place.",5,2014,06,29
29,Excellent hotel. Beautifull! True luxury,Absolutely gorgeous hotel. True luxury. Excellent service. Breakfest is superb. Definetly worth its money. Good location as well. Also a good choice for a romantic getaway. Beautifull stay. We will certainly go there again.,5,2014,06,27
29,Wonderful experiance,"We stayed here as the final stop on a 2 week plus vacation. It was a great place to unwind and prepare to head for home. There are several must see locations with in walking distance. Go see the Barcelona Music Hall. La Sagrada Familia is a good walk but worth it. Several Gaudi buildings are close by. The Picasso Museum is close as is the old district with some wonder shops and restaurants. Don't miss the Barcelona Cathedral. The accommodations were wonderful. They upgraded us to a suite. The bed was very comfortable, the staff very professional and courteous. They serve a buffet Breakfast every morning in the courtyard that is to die for. Will definitely stay here again if we return to Barcelona",5,2014,06,25
29,Barcelona Baby!!,"Great Hotel in a convenient location. We arrived mid day on a Friday and our room was available. A smooth check in and we settled in for 4 day of all that Barcelona has to offer. The hotel is located just @ the edge of the Bari Gotic and it certainly is the corner of walk and don't walk (very busy).

The room was comfortable and spacious (we had a junior suite) but it was the Bathroom that made it for us. very large with a great shower with an awesome rain head and that jacuzzi tub made the stay for my wife. who'd have thought that the bathtub would be the hi point of the stay?? It's the little thing that have the biggest impact.

The staff was cordial and helpful and made us feel welcome. We had breakfast one morning and while the room was quite beautiful we felt that the variety of the offerings was a bit limited. The selection of items was not what we expected from a hotel of this rating and price. We'd just come from Madrid @ The Westin and they had a more extensive buffet @ a slightly lower price. We were especially disappointed by the rather pedestrian breads offered as well as pretty generic yogurts and cereals really?? I know they can do better to elevate that part of what otherwise is a World Class Hotel.

We scheduled a Mayan reflexology massage @ the spa and it was in a word Disappointing!! We have regular reflexology massages in the states as well as in Mexico on the Mayan Riviera so i think we know what it should be. believe me I've had better in Las Vegas and I think they are known for a B grade spa experience at best. For the price charged there was no value and I'm not a cheapskate by any stretch of the imagination. The therapists were very nice just not very good. it turns out we were walking around in the neighborhood the next night and stumbled upon a massage place that offered reflexology massages @ 60 euros for 45 minutes that were a quantum leap better than what we had @ the hotel spa.",5,2014,06,21
29,El Palace Perfection,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and we wanted location, comfort and service.  El Palace's staff could not do enough for us.  They guided us to the best restaurants, even the best tapas restaurants, were fabulous.  We were celebrating an anniversary and were given an immediate room upgrade.  The bed was extremely comfortable & the bathroom was marble, double sinks, large beautiful opulent shower & roman tub.  Our room overlooked the Gran Via, but we were not disturbed by the street noise.  The breakfast room is stunning, everything  from continental to full breakfast.  We chose the continental, as the full breakfast had so many meats & we prefer light fare in the morning.  We plan to visit Barcelona next year and will certainly visit El Palace again.
Thank you so much to the entire staff, including the doorman & concierge who helped with reservations.  El Palace is the hotel to stay when visiting Barcelona!!",5,2014,06,20
29,It truly is a palace!,"We have never Ben welcomed so warmly at a hotel before! We arrived from San Francisco, a long flight, and were greeted by Celine who has to be be one of the most elegant people I have ever met. We had tea I'm the gorgeous parlor as they made our rooms ready. The concierges were very helpful with tickets and information, and the rooms were very spacious and beautifully decorated. Finally the best shower in Europe! The door actually closes!
This is our new home in Barcelona!",5,2014,06,19
29,25th Wedding Anniversary- A Truly Magnificent Experience,"We celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary at El Palace and we cannot thank all of the staff enough. What a truly magnificent time we had and were very well looked after! Our room was upgraded to a beautiful Junior Suite and we would like to thank Janna, Katharina and Carla and the General Manager for our gifts. We would like to also thank Reception and the doormen and room staff for always greeting us with a smile and for tending to all our needs. The No.19 restaurant provided excellent food and service.
Our Anniversary evening was spent at the Caelis restaurant? We ordered the Menu Festival and words cannot describe how wonderful the food and wine pairing was! All of the staff were fabulous and we were very impressed with the wonderful display of courses? If in your lifetime you want to experience quality in food and service you must book this hotel and enjoy splendour throughout! Thank you El Palace and Caelis you are the best in the world! Mr and Mrs Parry",5,2014,06,19
29,Superb,"We spent 3 nights at El Palace. In its previous life it was The Ritz and taxi drivers still refer to it as that.  The hotel is very luxurious and service was superb as was the breakfast though at Euro28 a head it's is not cheap. You can get a good quality breakfast or snack at the cafe opposite. 
The rooms are very well equipped and the bathrooms great, especially the walk in shower. There is building work opposite but you don't hear it with the windows closed.  All rooms have air conditioning. 
It is one street off the Passieg se Gracia which did feel like a street too far when walking back from La Ramblas late at night but the area felt safe. 
A couple of niggles: there was a bare earth wire attached to one of the wall lights in the room and they didn't fix one of the lights in the bathroom but as there were about a dozen more it did not make a big difference. 
No pool unlike many of the hotels in Barcelona but we spent so much time sightseeing we probably would not have had time to use one. 
Would heartily recommend.",5,2014,06,16
29,Outstanding Honeymoon Experience,"The El Palace provided a wonderful honeymoon for me and my wife. The service is impeccable, the rooms are spacious and very clean, the hotel is walking distance from almost all the great restaurants and sight-seeing areas. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel in Barcelona.

Pros:
Central location--walking distance to lots of eating locations, tourist sites including the Sagrada Familia, beach, and central plazas.

Service--each hotel employee was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations, directions, problem-solving, and anything else we needed during our stay.

Room--The rooms were spacious. They had a walk-in closet. The king bed we had was comfortable. The tv worked well. The view was great. It was always clean.

Lounge--The lounge is opulent and worth having a drink or coffee at during your stay.

Cons:
Bathroom--The bathrooms are awkwardly designed with too many doors (shower, toilet, main door) that keep bumping into one another. It's a little tight for two people to be using at the same time.

Wi-Fi--The wi-fi connectivity was not great in the hotel rooms. We had about one bar (if that). It was fine in the lobby and the lounge though.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience and the cons are just my attempt to provide feedback so that they might address these issues in the future. In other words, the pros far out-weighed the cons. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in Barcelona. Thank you to all the El Palace employees for a great honeymoon experience!",5,2014,06,15
29,Absolutely astonishing!,"The hotel is head and shoulders above anything else - I actually went by or had dinner at the other five stars that I was considering before spending time in Barcelona - and they weren't even close - 
The rooms are elegant, the breakfast room is a gorgeous veranda, and the staff, from the maid to the concierge - were professional, elegant and graceful - not just doing their job - going beyond helpful in every possible instance.  
All five stars should be doing this - but often, that is not the case for travelers.  If you are considering a once in a lifetime trip to Barcelona (and if you aren't you should) - just stop reading and comparing and book this hotel.  The restaurant is amazing, the spa is small but elegant, the location is perfect - and Barcelona is an amazing world city in every direction. 
The desk staff upgraded us for no particular reason, except they were graceful and accommodating  - we received a bottle of sparkling wine in our room that evening, just over and over people seemed to be glad that we had made this choice.  If you wish to feel like royalty, you will make the absolutely perfect choice staying here.  I wish that trip advisor gave me the opportunity to give six stars on the review - pay the bit extra (if you are still debating) - you aren't going to even notice the difference in a year or two - and you will remember your experience at the Palace Hotel.",5,2014,06,15
29,A fantastic hotel!,We stayed at this hotel for the first 2 nights of our trip in Spain. The rooms were very nice and the the staff was great. Very convenient location and easy to walk to many tourist sights. Great food and drinks just down the street.,5,2014,06,12
29,Very Upper Crust,"If you like tyo be pampered this is the hotel for you! Excellent nightclub and a very cool Cigar Bar. Breakfast in the atrium was exciting, almot felt like being served in a big mansion!

Spa services are wonerful...book at check-in with 15% off coupon!",5,2014,06,11
29,Great Hotel,"My wife and I have stayed here 3 times previous, and found the hotel to be a really great place to stay. The cost is a little more than you would wish to spend, but its worth it. The rooms are large, and fairiy quite, even though the hotel is positioned on the corner of two main roads, we heard very little traffic. Breakfast is also amazing, with plenty of choice and Champagne if you want it. The staff are all very curtious and friendly. The only one issue we did have was wanting afternoon tea after a long morning and afternoon of shopping. Apparently, you need to order this 48 hours in advance. Sorry El Palace, this is not normal for a 5 star hotel. The staff did try to provide tea with some petit-fours, but it wasn't what we wanted. The only bad mark on the entire stay. Thank you.",4,2014,06,11
29,fantastic,"Best experience, hotel I have ever stayed at.recommend to anyone.staff lovely, hotel immaculate, felt like royalty.I visited this hotel for a week in 2010, never been here before, and I will come and stay here again, it is everything and more. The service, the food, the staff is just exceptional. The hotel is close to everything, and aircon is on when you need it in the hot summer months.",5,2014,06,05
29,A few problems with this hotel,"Upon arrival everything looks fine with this hotel, you step from the bustly street and its serine the atmosphere of calm and quiet.  Check in was fine, then we were escorted to the room by a nice lady who gave me her business card.  The room,,,,,was small and scruffy, we were in a deluxe suite, which to me looked like a basic room, the view was of air conditioners.  The carpets look like they need to be renewned and the room was cramped, the mini bar was in a strange area.  The shower had a overhead spray so you got soaked unless you used the hand held.  The breakfast area...... work is commencing some place in the hotel so when you eat breakfast you hear the sounds of machinery constantly, and its a little chilly in there even for someone who is always warm like myself.  The choice of food for breakfast could be better.  Snack area....which is located just before the business area near the bar,,,the food here was excellent as was the service no faults there.  Check out,,,we left this hotel and informed reception early in the morning that we wouldn't be staying that evening, we had booked direct with the hotel, they said it was only fair that we paid half towards that nights stay, which we did, felt a little ripped off.  ALSO DO NOT EXCHANGE MONEY WITH THIS HOTEL THEY RIP YOU OFF  generally this hotel is a little noisey in public areas also a little noisey in the bedrooms due to overlooking air conditioners",3,2014,06,05
29,Great Stay,"This is a marvelous hotel in a very central location in Barcelona. The easy to use metro system is only two blocks away. Our room was spacious, spotless and perhaps most important, very quiet. And the staff was fantastic from our early morning arrival from the airport to the moment we left. Everyone seemed to go out of their way to satisfy. We included breakfast at all the hotels throughout our three week visit to Spain and Portugal and the one at the El Palace was by far the best. Selection, quality, service were all top notch. Concierge service was skillful and directed us to several great local restaurants. The lounge was a perfect setting for an end of evening stop and drink. This is a 5-star hotel that provides a 5-star experience. Highly recommend and when we return to Barcelona, this will be our choice for hotel.",4,2014,06,05

29,A lovely (and sublimely located) hotel in Barcelona,What a great location and ambiance. I loved this hotel. The decor was gorgeous without an ounce of pretension. Stayed here two nights during The Christmas holiday and the hotel was decorated beautifully. From an easily navigable location and so close to shops & great tapas.,5,2014,05,28
29,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel in Barcelona, extremely helpful and friendly staff. We stayed here before boarding a cruise to Rome. The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Barcelona and we would highly recommend this property.",5,2014,05,28
29,A special treat,"This is a very elegant and well located hotel, close to many points of interest. We selected a classic deluxe room which was beautifully appointed with a very comfortable bed. Very wide corridors and opulent reception areas are light filled and spacious.
Double glazed windows and heavy curtains provide a quiet enough haven from the bustle of Barcelona. The room price was commensurate with the level of decor and comfort but sometimes it is worth it! It would be hard to consider another property if Returning to Barcelona.",5,2014,05,27
29,Excellence,"Awesome hotel in a fabulous part of town.  Elegant and comfortable rooms although may be noisy if facing the main avenue.  The bathroom was really nice with the exception of the sink.  Service was professional, friendly, and not overly pretentious.  Would stay here again if visiting Barcelona. ",5,2014,05,26
29,A super unforgettable stay,"We just came back from our 10 days of vacation starting from Barcelona then to Nice, Monte Carlo, Venice and return home from Barcelona.   Hotel El Palace was the first place that we stayed for two nights and I can't say enough of its elegance, super service, classy staff and amazing location.    Unfortunately there was no space to book a room at this hotel on our last two days in Barcelona, we ended up to book in another hotel which was a totally different experience.  At the El Palace hotel  our room was not a city view in which the hotel management immediately moved us to another room that was just perfect.  The comfort of the bed, spacious room, the luxurious bathroom, the most amazing breakfast, every thing was super .  Our wonderful time at this hotel has motivated us to definitely return back to Barcelona, but  this time with our two girls, knowing that Barcelona is the most beautiful place to visit and staying at this hotel will make it just perfect.   Thanks for such a great service.",5,2014,05,26
29,Exceptional Service,"The El Palace is a special place, a real retreat.  Our room was quiet and spacious.  The concierge service was above and beyond what you would expect.   The man at the concierge desk went so far as to buy show tickets for me with his personal credit card (for some reason my US card would not work online) and then I paid him cash.  The location is very convenient and in a very safe section.  The breakfast is wonderful - huge selection.  The musician in the bar was very entertaining and personable.  I highly recommend the El Palace.",5,2014,05,26
29,"Wonderful stay, great service","We stayed at the Hotel Palace in March 2014 on the occasion of our wedding anniversary. The room and hotel are splendid, and the central location is perfect for sightseeing and evenings out.
But  above all we enjoyed the friendly and professional service which made our stay at the hotel truly special.",5,2014,05,20
29,SUPER,"I found it a wonderful Hotel,  service was perfect and location is in a very good position! I do raccomand it. it is perfect for family, partners and friends. I am very happy with it! and Barcelona is absolutly a city that has to be seen",5,2014,05,20
29,Old-world elegance,"We had a lovely stay at this former Ritz property. The room was comfortable, with all necessary appointments; the bathroom was luxurious, with both a shower and a tub as well as separate WC. We asked for washcloths (not standard in Europe) and they were occasionally provided, a very small issue. The included breakfast was quite acceptable, though it was only cold items; for an upcharge, one could have the hot food, which was really a lavish spread. Excellent coffee, of course. We'd definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,15
29,"The right hotel, the right place, any time!","This is our second stay at the relatively  recently renovated Hotel, restoring it to the elegance of the past with the amenities of today.  From the breakfast area, to the tucked away bar downstairs at night, guests are in for a treat. Elegant settings for breakfast, and a fast paced, yet relaxed setting of that tucked away bar with superior bar tenders led by Danny Martin are fab ways to start and end the day.  The entertainment is also sure to please with 'big'  live music.  Don't be afraid to put your drink choice and destiny in the hand of Danny for a 'imagination inspired' night cap!  Service from front desk, to bell hops, and service staff are all befitting the 5 star rating.",5,2014,05,12
29,Incredible Hotel - Gracious Staff,"This is Hotel is Europe at it`s finest.  Rooms do not come cheap here but you get what you pay for and this hotel gives you everything you pay for and more.  The only drawback is the Gym which is small and offers only limited equipment.  However, the basics are covered so giving that everything else is over the top I recommend this hotel highly.

The Hotel has a great history and is frequented by wealthy European Families and Business People.  What I really like about this hotel is they have kept the old feel to it with period furnishings but with modern ammenities.  While the Restaurants are inexpensive the service, food quality, and presentation merit the prices.  I shall return and thanks for a wonderful stay in one of my favorite cities in Europe.",5,2014,05,11
29,El Palace Hotel Was A Disappointment,"Barcelona was our last stop on an 18-day tour of Spain and Portugal--a mother/daughter adventure with my adult daughter that did not end well due to one inappropriately aggressive and rude woman behind the reception desk. I would have given the hotel a better rating, but it only takes one very unpleasant experience to tarnish one's perception of a hotel--and unpleasant would be an understatement. Before I elaborate on this, I want to comment on the hotel in general. My daughter and I stayed at 5-star hotels throughout our trip, and we are both seasoned travelers. The El Palace has been completely refurbished in recent years (as the Alfonso X111 in Seville has been, and where we also stayed on this trip), and it is elegantly furnished in the lobby and sitting areas. I did notice that the carpeting leading to the elevators is worn and shredded in places and should be replaced, but overall, the main areas are very attractive. Breakfast is served in an atria/tented room that is quite lovely, albeit a bit chilly in cooler weather, although the heat lamps do help. The breakfast staff as well as the concierge staff were cordial and attentive. The location is very good and within a short walk to Barcelona's most famous street--La Rambla. The hotel is situated right above a metro, so you will hear and feel the rumbling ocassionally, especially on a lower floor. We were on the top floor, so we barely felt it and it was not an issue for us. We booked a classic deluxe room with Roman bath and check-in was fairly routine, although not particularly friendly save for a very nice woman who escorted us to our room. A bottle of champagne and chocolates awaited us--a nice touch, although they were expecting a couple, not a mother and daughter. I had inquired about an upgrade on check-in, as I often do, and was told it was not available--even though this hotel often gives complimentary upgrades according to the reviews. As I was confident our room would be quite adequate, I accepted the gentleman's explanation. The room was nicely appointed, with a beautiful marble non-functioning fireplace and small balcony that faced the Gran Via. The bathroom was very spacious with a large shower, and the mosaic-tiled Roman bath was lovely. My issue was with the room size, not only because of the cost, but because I felt mislead by the hotel website claiming the room was spacious, when in fact it was quite the opposite. Before the renovation, these classic deluxe rooms had probably been the sitting areas of suites, so the built out closet/armorie and the armoire on the opposite side that held the bar cluttered the room. There was not much space to walk around comfortably, and the night tables were crammed in next to these armoires. It was the smallest room in any of the 5-star hotels we stayed in by far, so after the first night (and because it was evident to me that the hotel was far from fully booked) I went to reception and asked for an upgrade to a larger accomodation, as we had been given complimentary upgrades without even asking at two of the other hotels on this trip. I was then that I had my encounter with the woman behind the reception desk who informed me in a slightly hostile manner that she could only offer us a suite that faced the courtyard, but I would have to pay for it. Since we did not want a room/suite that was dark and had no view, and certainly did not want to pay for it, I declined after an uneasy conversation that ended after she made a remark stating why would she give us the room for free when she could try and sell it. Later, I looked up reviews on the hotel and noticed that a gentleman had just been offered a complimentary upgrade the day before, and finding that curious, I again approached the same woman behind the reception desk on the morning we were checking out to ask her about it. Obviously I was not expecting an upgrade at this point, but I wanted to know why some people are given complimentary upgrades on a given day and others are not. There were no other guests in the reception area at this time, and I want to make a point here that I am always very civil to hotel staff, so it was shocking when this woman became exceedlingly agressive and defensive and proceeded to lecture me about what I said or did not say in our prior conversaton. She was clearly not interested in ""discussing"" anything with me and continued with her barrage in what amounted to a one-way conversation. When I asked for her name, she immediately snapped at me that she knew I would complain about her. The gentleman who was also behind the desk tried in vain to get her to stop her tirade, and even after I directed my conversation to him, she went on and on. I finally left the reception area without an apology from either of them, and subsequently no apology was offered by any staff memeber who knew of the incident. I wondered if I was a man if I would have been treated in the same manner and with such lack of repsect. The manager was not on duty yet, but who knows what his repsonse would have been. Later that morning upon check out, I again approached the reception area where this same woman was checking in an elderly couple. I politely asked when the gentleman would be returning, since I didn't want to deal with her again, and her response was to snap at me with the comment: ""Can't you see he's not here."" That was the last straw, and I told her she was obnoxious and unprofessional and she had no place in the hotel and hospitality industry. The gentleman did return and checked us out, but again, no apology. On a final note, the hotel is lovely aesthetically, but the classic deluxe rooms are very cramped. The hotel has an empty feeling, as we had just come from The Ritz in Madrid, which bustled with guests and had a warm and inviting atmosphere. The rooms at The Ritz need refurbishing, but at least the one we had  was huge, and the staff was professional and curteous and apologetic when something was amiss. Such was not the case with the El Palace hotel. I found it to be a stuffy hotel that caters to older couples, and with one very rude and unprofessional woman behind the reception desk. A 5-star hotel that falls very short in 5-star conduct and professionalism.",2,2014,05,05
29,"Excellent Service, perfect location","El Palace Hotel is a beautiful gem of a hotel combining old world architecture, grace and service with post-modern conveniences such as HDTV, internet, roman-style tub and separate shower.  All of its staff are committed to the enjoyment and comfort of their guests - service comes first, from the door man who actually opens and holds doors to the concierge who solicits your feedback on all choices he or she has helped you make.  I unhesitatingly give this my highest recommendation - and i'm notoriously a demanding patron - especially when paying premium prices.",5,2014,05,04
29,Amazing place to stay,"Everything about the Palace Hotel was fabulous - the staff, the room, the location, etc.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet as well.  The concierge was very helpful - both before and during our visit.  We arrived at the Palace hotel after a long flight and it was the start of our vacation  it couldn't have been more perfect!",5,2014,04,29
29,beuatiful gem of a hotel,"The hotel is very special- gorgeous lounge and the suites are fabulous - lucky enough to receive complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was stunning- loved the Jacuzzi tub! There wasn't a view from the room but the comfort of the room was exceptional.
However what really sets it apart are the staff: wonderfully warm welcome from Celine who greets most guests by name, very helpful concierge and lovely ladies in the spa Adrianna and Antonella. During my stay, nothing was too much trouble including wrapping a bottle of wine for the return flight home. The small touches of complimentary Easter chocolates and generous supply of yummy L'Occitane bath goodies contribute to making me feel both very welcome and special.
Thanks to the team for a great stay and it's on my list of hotels to return to.",5,2014,04,27
29,Top class,Stayed for one night and was upgraded to junior suite. They have a beautiful lobby and really old palatial style. Yavier who checked us in took us around the hotel and was very helpful . Service is top class. It is palace hotel,5,2014,04,23
29,Stylish. Opulent. Grand,"A great place to stay if you're looking to holiday in style. The hotel lives up to its name - it's like being in a palace indeed. The entrance is understated but when you get past the concierge and into the saloon, it's a beautiful and spacious room and a great place to sit, have tea and just relax.
The whole place spells opulence but it's done in great style and does not come across as ostentatious.",4,2014,04,21
29,Beautiful Botique Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my husband in April.  Hotel is very nice and smaller than our other Spain hotels.  Location was very good-very walkable to many things.  A quick taxi ride to the train station.  The hotel was beautiful and had a large elegant room where you could sit and read or talk, on the main level.  
  The breakfast was served in a   beautiful tented room and the buffet selections were good but seemed to have more lunch type foods than breakfast foods (we prefer the later)  
The staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel was very clean.  Our room was confortable and had great bath products and shampoo.  The bathroom had 2 sinks and lots of counter space.  The only thing we didn't like were the high faucets in the sinks- had to be careful when washing your face, not to splash water on counter and floor.  Faucet in shower was difficult to adjust so that water sprayed just in the shower.  Our room had both a shower and a tub. We really enjoyed our stay here and highly recommend it.  We first heard about this hotel when we overheard a woman in a restaurant in the U.S. telling her friends what a nice stay she had here.  We asked her about it & she said, ""Don't even think about it-  just book it.""   We're glad that she gave us that advice.",5,2014,04,20
29,A Quiet Oasis In a Bustling City,"Located in a quiet neighborhod, just off of Passeig de Gracia, on the Gran Via de les Cortes Catalanes, this wonderful hotel is a totally updated experience that still captures the magic and history of old Barcelona.  Within short walking distance of the Gothic Quarter, the Sagrada Familia, and the Casa Battlo, it's the ideal place to stay.  The staff is thoroughly professional and always friendly.  They jump to help you or answer any question you might have.  The lobby makes you feel that you are back in the late 19th century but every room in the hotel has been totally renovated to 21st Century standards.  The complimentary breakfast is a great way to start each day.  The spa and gym are the perfect way to end the day before a night out on the town!  I'd go back in a heart beat.",5,2014,04,14
29,Superb hotel with good service,"The hotel Palace, is the former Barcelona Ritz. It was revamped a few years ago and looks great. The grand salon is very impressive, with nice pieces of furnitures. Breakfast room is pleasant, and I guess it is at the air during warm days. Buffet breakfast is very nice. 
The rooms are of decent size, and bathrooms are modern. Nothing fancy but it is classy. 
The concierges are very helpful. 
We had the chance to have a room on the inner courtyard, so it was very quiet. As the hotel is located on a major avenue of the city, it is possible that rooms facing the avenue are more noisy.",5,2014,04,11
29,Excellent hotel,"I enjoyed staying in El Palace Hotel with great location friendly staff very nice rooms .. The most important very helpful concierge .. I recommend this hotel if travelling to Barcelona .. It is near the Rambla square and the shopping area  
",5,2014,04,11
29,Flawless. Stunning room and excellent service.,"Of the three hotels we stayed at in Spain, this was our favorite. Now, you should be prepared that to get there by taxi, you have to say it used to the Ritz (lots of hotel using the word ""Palace"" gets the cabbies a little confused). You are warmly greeted and assisted with the heavy doors every time you enter and exit. Your hotel key is a retro key on a large tassled chain, which I liked. There's a beautiful old-world flair to the public spaces but not stuffy. The room was beautifully appointed with an old fashioned marble fireplace (not functioning as far as I could tell), incredibly comfortable bed, TV hidden inside the mirror (I know it's not new technology but it always seems so cool to flick on the remote and the mirror turns into a TV). Large windows overlooking the main street but rich, deep and thick silk curtains keep the noise out. 

The breakfast buffet is served in a beautiful, marble floored sun room. There are heaters on in the morning to take the chill off. One of the best breakfasts ever with hot foods, some Asian foods, fabulous pastries, cheeses, meats, little tapas sandwiches, cereals, etc. Very child friendly choices I noticed as well. Full selection of newspapers when you enter. Our breakfast was included in our room rate so it was a great way to start the day and kept us going until mid-afternoon. 

The staff is attentive, friendly and helpful with every tourist need. The bathroom amenities were Occitane and were refreshed every day with full bottles by the housekeeping crew. Just can't say enough about this lovely hotel and hope I get to stay there again.",5,2014,03,27
29,"Great Hotel, great location","The El Palace is absolutely spectacular with old-class grandeur. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to Placa Catalunya and within easy walking distance of most sites. The public areas, such as the large lobby, are indeed like a palace. Staff is very accommodating and helpful. El Palace offers free Wi-Fi. The breakfast buffet is served in the covered patio and is excellent. I had a ""single"" room; there is one of them on each floor. These single rooms are small, with little space to manoeuvre around the bed. There is plenty of hanging space for clothes, but very limited shelve space. By contrast, the bathroom is spacious, with a lovely rain shower (no tub) and is well equipped. Highly recommended is the Caelis restaurant (1 Michelin star), here I had my best dinner ever. I also used the Spa and booked massage. The massage was excellent, criticism is the high price. The Spa is well equipped, the sauna is somewhat small. All in all a great hotel and highly recommended.",5,2014,03,24
29,Live like a King,"Fabulous old world decor and service, great location and spacious suites
So much more charm than the modern hotels built for the olympics
You will be glad you stayed here
The concierge staff went above and beyond in helping us with dining and sightseeing choices",5,2014,03,23
29,Felt like royalty,"The title of this hotel does not disappoint. El Palace is great, the rooms are spectacular and the location is prime for those who like being near everything, but not necessarily in the loud, busy hustle and bustle. The concierge is great and the hotel maintains old-class splendor as the keys are still turn key and you can leave them with the front desk each time you leave. Only disappointment was the high price for the breakfast buffet (32 euros per person per day). This turned us away from eating at the hotels every morning, which we usually enjoy doing. The room's facilities made up for this.",5,2014,03,23
29,Convenient Location,"Nice clean hotel with rooms recently updated.  Staff was terrific.  Location worked well as it is a short walk to most major sites.  Only real complaint was that the fitness room was very small and didn't have great equipment.  Plus, our room was at the end of the hall and there is construction going on in the building next door.  The noise started around 7am daily which made sleeping in challenging.",4,2014,03,23
29,El Palace Hotel in Barcelona,"I took my wife to Barcelona for her 60th birthday.  We stayed at El Palace Hotel.  I cannot heap enough praise on the staff and accommodation.  Talk about total opulence and splendour, it was amazing 5* The Hotel made the trip something very special and the staff could not be more helpful and friendly.  We will most definitely be staying at the El Palace again.",5,2014,03,15
29,nice weekend in barcelona,"Very nice hotel: nice room and very well located near the most important barrios. Th internal 1  michelin star restaurant (Caleis) is worth  the money and  i will not be surprised if shortly it will get a second one. Good services provided with the help of a valid concierge.  Just a negative poin , I would have expect some basic SPA service ( Sauna, Steam room) to be offered for free to the hotel customer and based on the high rate that you are expecting from a 5 star hotel",5,2014,03,13
29,Old world elegance with modern facilities,"Our recent stay was very pleasant. Highly recommended for its very comfortable as well as quiet room, attentive service, and its beautiful old world charm. The location is also very central and convenient to explore a great city.",5,2014,03,07
29,Elegance and beauty in Barcelona,"Wonderful stay! Great staff! Very efficient concierge! I spent 3 nights at El Palace Hotel with my wife and parents. The experience was fantastic. Growing up in Europe, I was pleased to know that classic European hospitality still exists.",5,2014,03,07
29,Very good service,"This hotel is very clean and also is very attractive because it is exactly like palace .... 
Room is very nice , especially bathroom and ....
Location also is good but far from GSMA EXHIBITION
It is better they expand internet speed and TV CHANNELS
",4,2014,02,25
29,Fabulous classic hotel,"We spent 2 nights at the hotel and can safely say the service was outstanding, from the moment we arrived and were greeted by Caterina to when we left following a cheery 'adios' from the doorman.  We stayed in the Junior Suite (223) which was beautiful, spacious, modern and comfortable...with a shower to die for!  Breakfast was excellent and served in the most fantastic garden room.  Located a few minutes walk from all the major attractions, the hotel is well located in Central Barcelona.  If you are looking for quiet, calm and sumptuous surroundings in a busy city then this is the place to come.",5,2014,02,23
29,Luxury & Location,"I had an amazing stay at this gorgeous hotel.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations on things to see and places to eat.  The hotel was spotlessly clean, lavish and in a perfect location!",5,2014,02,22
29,A Taste of Gracious Old Spain,"Thirty years ago, having just taken the bar exam, I celebrated by backpacking through Europe. It was late summer, 1983 when I stepped off the train and hiked my way throughout the Rambla of Barcelona. Barcelona was the last of the many cities I visited on my six week sojourn so I was now an ""experienced"" traveler. Nothing I had seen previously however, prepared me for this city. 

This was a much slower time when there was no smart phones, internet or any form of instant communication. No jeans or sneakers were to be seen. Men wore slacks and collared shirts and ladies walked through the streets holding each other arm in arm, the color of their shoes always matching their dresses. There was a formality in every task, whether it was a waiter pulling out your seat as you sat down for a meal or the ushers guiding you to the correct path as your toured La Sagrada Familia.

So it was with much excitement when I recently returned after so much time away. Barcelona had changed. It was cosmopolitan. It had hosted the Olympics which brought much needed improvement to the streets and transportation. It was cleaner and much more crowded. It was sophisticated. I liked it. But with all this improvement some of that old graciousness that I remembered seemed to have been lost. That is until, I stepped into El Palace.

El Palace is a magnificent hotel. The reviews already posted accurately describe its old world charms and beauty. Yes, it is a bit faded but where else can you sit and have breakfast in a huge solarium where every possible item you can wish to eat is laid out in glorious detail. 

The staff however, is what separates this hotel from the others. That old world graciousness of Spain lives on here. Anything you require is their concern. As an example, after walking Barcelona all day, I would need an ice pack to sooth my knees. It became a custom for my wife and I to return in the afternoon and the front desk, with a smile on their face, would have my chipped ice ready for me. Directions, maps, reservations and general advice were always available and always given with care. 

I hope you enjoy El Palace as much as I did.",4,2014,02,16
29,"Sumptious, impeccable hotel.","It takes a huge commitment to maintain a glorious old building to this standard and a huge commitment is what you get when you stay in this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived every member of staff was a pleasure to deal with - reception felt personally responsible that we had been badly overcharged by our taxi driver from the airport, despite it being nothing to do with them. Our porter took great pleasure in showing off the features of our lovely room ( the TV is IN the mirror ). Everything was spotless, the bathroom was luxurious, the bed was huge. Public areas of the hotel are like, well, a palace. The grand lobby is as beautiful as any great royal palace that you could ever imagine, full of comfortable couches and gilded furnishings. Staff were all very friendly, the concierge desk in particular went out of their way to help us with local tips. We only had one meal here - in the restaurant by the bar as opposed to the Michelin star restaurant - and the food was wonderful. Again, the staff here were so genuine and friendly. We would stay here again for sure.",5,2014,02,13
29,"Nice hotel, great service; a bit faded","The former Ritz Hotel in Barcelona, El Palace maintains high standards of service, but is a bit faded in appearance. We had a dimly light, inner, light-well room. (I probably could have raised it as an issue, as it was listed in the ""Deluxe"" category. I chose not to do so, as we were spending much of our time out of the room. Suffice it to say, make certain you get an room facing out.) Service was great. We received turndown service even after 10 pm at night just by leaving out the sign ""Please make up my room."" The restaurant Caelis (off the lobby, Michellin one star) is just superb. And the hotel is close to Passeig de Gracia and the Rambla, both with good shopping, restaurants, and train/subway service.",4,2014,02,04
29,Birthday party,"WOW. WOW. WOW.
 Seven girls on a birthday celebration and we loved El Palace, from walking in the door we were welcomed. To the rooms which were exceptional. Any problems we had were dealt with quickly, even found a radio for us.
Spa was a welcome relax after a day shopping and staff were pleasant and very good at their job. Cocktail Bar amazing, Afternoon Tea superb. Room service very quick and pleasant waiters. Enjoyed every night the music bar. Money well spent.  
Highlight was dinner in Caelis Restaurant, choose the 5/7 course menu well worth it.
What an experience hope to back soon . Want spoilt and  luxury, stay at the Palace.
It was a DREAM come true. Big Thanks to Fatima who had 4 months of non stop emails.",5,2014,02,02
29,Exquiste Experience,"We had a most glorious 3 nights at this hotel, the last leg of our holiday in Europe. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous, the staff ever so helpful and gracious. Special shout out to Javier and Francisco at Concierge. They helped us in so many ways. The room was spacious and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. The location was not far from many of the 'must see' sights and yet not in the main bustling area. We felt special and spoilt. A 'must do' is have a meal at the Michelin Star rated Caelis at the hotel. A wonderful way to wrap up the trip.",5,2014,02,02
29,Hotel Palace GL Barcelona,"That was very disappointing experience. Stuff is polite - but quiet ignorant. We arrived by car and Hotel didn't arrange discount parking rate, no explanation , no afford to help.  Hotel itself is beautiful and in the centre location. Meal  at the  restaurant was good - but as everything in this Hotel - not a perfect service. I still can recommend to others",3,2014,02,01
29,superb......,"excellent Location! wonderful staff and very rich breakfast buffet… The junior suite was large enough for 4 persons, very large walk in closet and the shower was out of this world with two rain showers :)…

Bravo...",5,2014,01,20
29,"it was ""wow"" on ex Ritz hotel","Spectacular building , spectacular design, wonderful breakfast, perfect services. I was with my family in 2011 and I have great memories from El Palace Hotel, I will go back for sure. Very well located, steps away from Las Ramblas ! I recommend the hotel !",5,2014,01,19
29,Old World Elegance; 'Leader's Club RIPOFF!',"Four of us booked two 'Classic Deluxe' rooms to treat ourselves before starting a two week Rick Steves tour. The hotel is a former Ritz Carlton that has been recently refurbished and modernized with touches like the televisions are now concealed in the mirror above the mantle. The bathrooms have also been updated nicely. The room was spacious and luxuriously furnished. The bed was downright HARD, but the linens (and towels) were of excellent quality. The bathroom was furnished with L'Occitane product. The hotel is centrally located with lots of attractions and places to eat within walking distance.

The Good:
-The breakfast buffet was excellent and beautifully presented in an outdoor garden setting. Well worth the 35 Euros.
-Internet access was included. A small thing but a nice touch as nothing irritates me more than being charged an extra 20 Euros a day at a 'luxury hotel' when it is standard at Starbucks and the Holiday Inn Express.
-The public spaces were luxuriously furnished and comfortable and the rooms were spacious and well appointed.

The Not so Good:
-We were underwhelmed with the Mayan Luxury Spa. We have experienced many spas at resorts around the world and this one seemed more like an afterthought.  It is quite small and quite expensive (well over 1000 USD for the four of us to have 'Jetlag Cure' treatments.)  Our massages, which were part of the treatment, were of variable enjoyment. 
-Because I have enjoyed staying at several of their properties (and thought that I might stay at others in the future), I decided to purchase a membership to the 'Leader's Club' to enjoy the perks of repeat patronage of 'The Leading Hotels of the World.' I informed the hotel of my new membership number and was told that I would not be eligible for my benefits because I did not book the room through their (much more expensive) website. I asked if I could rebook my room through their website at the same price and was told no by their corporate office. It seemed like a relatively easy thing to do to keep a customer happy and gain 'good will' but rather, I was treated like a criminal trying to 'pull something.' 
Needless to say, I will avoid this and other such 'Leading Hotels' in my many years left of luxury travel.",4,2014,01,19
29,very good hotel in Barcelona,El Palace is a very elegant hotel located in the best location in Barcelona. The stuff is very professional and friendly and speaks prefect English. The rooms are nice and comfortable and the breakfast is spectacular.,5,2014,01,15

29,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service","recently stayed in Barcelona at the EL Palace Hotel. 

I must say, the hotel is absolutely spectacular and the staff and service match. 

Food was generally pretty good, though Breakfast was only ok in my opinion but i'm more of a traditional British breakfast type of guy so lets blame my palate for that one. 

Prices for drinks in the Jazz bar downstairs are pretty steep but unsurprising within a hotel of this quality.

Only downside is a lack of a pool, but other than that, top notch.

Would recommend staying here if you are ever in Barcelona.",5,2014,01,08
29,Great hotel in a wonderful area,"We stayed at the Palace this past November, and I am remiss in leaving a review. I think all would enjoy the service, the grand style and the location of this hotel. Last couple of times in Barcelona we stayed at the Arts and the Mercer, and although very lovely hotels, the Palace has the best location for seeing the city. The easy access to restaurants, shops and the gothic quarter make this an excellent touring location. The hotel itself is quite comfortable, we found the staff very accommodating and helpful. We were upgraded to a junior suite, and it was very comfortable as well as large. Bathroom and dressing room huge... Room cleaned to perfection every day. We are already talking about returning to this lovely hotel on our next trip. The only minor criticism is that the breakfast room is quite chilly in the cooler weather, so we requested seating under the portable heaters every morning.",5,2014,01,07
29,top notch service with old school luxury,"Very luxury one with Top service  in the middle of everything you can walk to the touristic plaza Catalonia in few minutes or to the paseo de Garcia just around the corner we had two suites one executive the other privilege both of them were very well even we needed more room for one night which was also very well ,  all with high speed Wi-Fi very  comfortable beds  ,spotless clean , the bathrooms were huge with all the needed amenities, they put as a welcome in the rooms bottle of champagne with chocolate  

The service starting with the doormen to every one we encountered were very well trained even when we mentioned that the rooms has to have coffee machines – as we thought that – the nice lady at the concierge
Managed to put the machines the next day – they know how to please the guests . I did try their casual dining # 19 one day with group of friends terrific food amazing service . at the new year eve they dropped to our rooms presents what was the nice touch is for men something to suit them as well as for women- was very nice gesture. All in all was very good experience",5,2014,01,06
29,old style luxury hotel,"The El Palace was opened in 1919 as the Barcelona Ritz Hotel. It seems the objective of the hotel management is to maintain that 1920s atmosphere. So this is a classic, old fashioned but very well run 5* hotel. Considering the large amount of ""design hotels"" - it is actually something different.

Overall the hotel has been recently renovated, rooms and in particular bathrooms are very nice. 

What we liked about the hotel:

* excellent service in all areas and great service attitude of all staff. 

* we really liked the Caelis restaurant - superb classic French food and great service. Don't miss that one!

* nice renovated rooms and bathrooms

* perfect location

We were a bit less excited by the casual 19 Restaurant (fairly average food, quite expensive for what is provided). We also found the main hotel lobby a bit ""dusty"" and the ""forest of christmas trees"" was full of spiderwebs. We also did not like the fairly strange breakfast rule for ""Leaders Club Members"", they provided free breakfast but only allowed one small section of the buffet, if you took some tomato, cheese or ham from the other table they charged extra - we did not like that ""nitpicker"" attitude.

I would recommend the hotel, just be aware it is the opposite of a ""trendy place"".",5,2014,01,04
29,Beautiful and Elegant,"Old world elegance with great staff. They moved us quickly and courteously as someone had smoked in our first room. Stunning lobby and bar.  We were there for only one night, unfortunately. Centrally located in a beautiful city. ",5,2014,01,02
29,Outstanding Service!,"I am not one to write too much as I normally just read on TA for tips and get some ideas for my own trips, but I definitely like to give kudos when it is due and to whom so this one goes out to Celine Ferrie! and the rest of her PR staff, Salud!! one of the best services EVER in all the trips I have made across the globe, be it luxury accomodations or hostel. Celine made our stay memorable especially as our trip (bro and sis) coincided on the wedding anniversary of our parents and my bro's bday. Celine made things happen and the concierge services, even from before we arrived, have assisted us already, and who ever were present those days we were there, hands down made our Barcelona stay truly memorable. thanks very much.",5,2014,01,02
29,A most spectacular hotel,"We stayed here for my partners birthday in January 2013 and I cannot fault this hotel. Superb service, luxury rooms, bathrooms with all the little touches you would expect as well as beautiful bar and restaurant area. The hotel is is a great location claw to la rambla and right off the main shopping streets next to the designer shops etc. If we ever go back to Barcelona we will be staying here!",5,2013,12,28
29,Luxury style in great location,"Hotel is very centrally located - near the old quarters of Barcelona (and the infamous Rambles street) as well as the shopping street.  We had a lovely room, with an amazing bathroom that included an old-style Roman shower.  Room was a decent size; bed and sheets were comfy.  

Location was great to explore the old quarters. We were close to everything and only had to take a taxi coming in, and onwards to our cruise.  We discovered a great restaurant nearby where we ended up having dinner on 2 nights - Ciudad Condal.",5,2013,12,25
29,Perfection!,"My grown daughter and I stayed here over Thanksgiving and had the time of our life.  The service is professional and yet so kind and helpful.  There is an elegance to the hotel that is combined with a friendliness that makes you feel pampered.  The rooms are exquisite; the beds and linens are incredibly comfortable, there is no noise, the bathrooms are beautiful and spacious and the decor is lovely.  I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but this is my favorite.  It is above a 5 star classification!.",5,2013,12,20
29,If you only go once,"If you go to Barcelona just once in your life, you should stay at the Palace. It stands head and shoulders above all the rest. It's rich in architecture and history and has every modern day amenity imaginable. 

Located only a few short blocks from the main shopping avenue and the La Rambla district, the hotel is close to great shopping, parks, fountains, outdoor and indoor dining, and even some of Barcelona's foremost tourist attractions like Antoni Gaudi's Casa Batllo.

Built by Charles Ritz in 1919, the hotel's history claims that Salvadoe Dali lived here in the 1950's and according to our taxi driver, Xavier Kugat parked his Rolls Royce by the front door when he was  living at the Ritz.. 

My wife and I stayed here in October for 1 week and had a wonderful time and we both feel it certainly deserves the 5 star rating. The rooms are spacious and have quality furnishings. Many of the rooms are uniquely shaped to form to the building's early twenty century architecture and wide open corridors provide a sense of safety and comfort. 

From the expert hotel staff to the Michelin rated restaurant Caelis everything was perfect. If you go there you might even get to meet the hotel manager, a friendly guitar paying guy named Juan who seems to be working all day, every day. 

El Palace Hotel Barcelone: a super star...",5,2013,12,15
29,Lovely Hotel on the Boulevard in Barcelona,"El Palace Hotel has grand lobbies and excellent service.  The guest room was very pretty and comfortable.  The mirror turns into a small television screen (selection of a few programs in many languages). Bathroom was luxurious.  
    Our  room opened out to give a view of the lovely street.
    A high point was the absolutely fantastic breakfast buffet in the gorgeous atrium. Everything to eat you could ever dream of!
    There was a Michelin star rated restaurant in the lobby. We didn't eat in it, but it was looked beautiful.
      All service was excellent.
     Hotel is large and can seem a little crowded when there is a large influx of guests. Still, only positive things to say about  El Palace.",5,2013,12,09
29,Real 5-star hotel,"Professional staff,  concierge that  knows everything. Big cozy rooms, good quality of materials.       Real 5-star hotel, you feel yourself  like in a palace. Champagne on the breakfast. I   really liked it and will come again and again.",5,2013,12,05
29,Excellent & Romantic,"We just returned from our stay in Barcelona at El Palace Hotel.  We learned before arriving from our tour guide that it was the old ""Ritz"" hotel and still has the plaque at the entrance way.  Each staff member makes every attempt to provide you with the very best service.  The beds are extremely comfortable and I really enjoy when a hotel offers you a pillow menu to choose the types of pillows you wish to use.",5,2013,11,26
29,Excellent,"Lovely grand hotel. The service is first rate and attentive. I was not feeling well and had room service breakfast, lunch and dinner which they delivered promptly and it was very good. 
The beds are extremely comfortable. 
I would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2013,11,25
29,Stunning,"I stayed here last week for a short business trip, only two nights, but it was lovely! It's in a fabulous location and teh hotel still has the old ""Ritz"" plaque on the floor by the entrance. The reception is around the corner by the entrance, very discreet, not like otehr hotes when it's out in the open. The concierge service is great, such is teh breakfast service with free Champagne! I had a Classic Deluxe room which was fairly big with a super king bed and the tv was behind the mirror which is really neat. the bathroom is stunning and you get lovely L'Occitane ameneties and even hand cream which is rare. The corridors are huge and although the hotel was full it seemed so quiet. This is really the only place to stay when in Barcelona, just fantastic.",5,2013,11,25
29,Excellent service!,"Staff goes above and beyond. Celine(guest relations) showed us to our room. She was very helpful, kind and even sent a bottle of champagne to our room. Good location, comfortable beds, great hotel decor and excellent breakfast buffet. They even have jamon w/ a cutting roller machine. Before checking out my family and I were waiting in the sitting area in the back room near the bar, Celine brought champagne and cake(as it was my birthday). Unforgettable experience!!!",5,2013,11,23
29,nice hotel!,"excellent service and staff were helpful.  i just came back from a business trip and stayed two nights.  it's beautiful let alone, the bed was comfortable and room was clean.  the location was convenient to nearby shops and restaurants.

I will definitely repeat",4,2013,11,21

We was realy imprest,by the atitude,they are realy proffi's!!! A reale pleasure to be a guest there!",5,2013,11,16
29,Overpriced for the level of service,"Clean room with comfortable bed, but cramped, with little space to walk around furniture. In general, staff is kind and smiling. Restaurant (""Caelis"") and bar close Sundays and Mondays.  Restaurant refuses service to hotel guests even when tables are available because ""they are understaffed"". Gym has the barest minimum equipment, but new and good quality.  Wi-fi is slow and intermittent, with areas of the hotel with very poor coverage (including my room). Prices in line with other hotels in Barcelona with far better facilities and services, such as Casa Fuster or Mandarin Oriental.",3,2013,11,14
29,Luxury of the 1930's,"Came here for a weekend break with the company I work for and the hotel was pure luxury. Grand hall downstairs, felt like I was in some movie from the 1930's. Its central location meant I could walk every where, 1 minute from the Ramla street, 10 minutes from the famous hills and a few minutes from the Marina, next door to places like the Catherdral.

Breakfast was amazing, the Service was flattering, newspapers available for free to read.

The room had a huge bathroom with my own wet room and Jacuzzi!!!

Negatives, not many TV channels for foreigners, I would have expected more international stations.
No Swimming pool.
You have to pay to use the Sauna!!!!!",5,2013,11,12
29,Exactly what we expected,"This hotel is beautiful - very luxurious.  We recently spent four nights in room 206. This is a standard room and true to the photo.  It is certainly spacious enough, spotless and comfortable.  There is a curved step out balcony located a few stories directly over the entrance with a never boring view.  Absolutely no noise issues, really.  There was a small walk in closet and the bathroom was just fine for both of us (magnifying mirror).  As typical we did have to request an iron and board.  I loved 206 because I could use the stairs instead of the lift, not too high not too low, just right.  I usually go a step or two above the standard room for space, but seriously this room was perfect.  
   We enjoyed one of each: bfast buffet, lunch and room service dinner.  Each was delicious, although overpriced (enjoyed dinner RS the most, jet lag night).  There is a little bakery right outside the door for coffee and pastries and a convenient store a few doors down the left side of the building.
   If the night club is open go to it.  It was crowded when we were there, so service was slow, but the music was great, so much fun!  Do it!!
   The entire staff was above and beyond friendly and helpful throughout our visit.  They offered dining recommendations, secured tickets, and always had a map in hand providing excellent directions.  They even attempted to book Renfe tickets, but alas we were directed to the travel agency up and across the street.
   The location is pretty central.  We walked everywhere, except Guell Park and Montjuic.
   So much fun!!   We loved this hotel and without question would stay here again!",5,2013,11,07
29,Gorgeous Hotel,"- Decor and furnishings are impecable
- outstanding customer service
- well made up rooms
- definitely worth doing breakfast
- downstairs bar/music lounge was devine, great cocktails
- good location
- perfect if you want something extremely quiet
- not ideal for children",5,2013,11,07
29,It is 'El Palace' (ex Ritz) - that says everything!,"Our suite was located at the back of the hotel. No view, but absolutely no noise either. 
Breakfast was good enough - not spectacular - but everything one needs was available
(yummy scrambled eggs).
One negative aspect: During the first morning the staff of the breakfast room (all four of them!) were still asleep, as nobody had energy enough to fill up the empty food trays and bowls (and the guests were 'too polite' to open their mouth - bad reviews to be expected?).",5,2013,11,05
29,Lives up to the photos!,"Camera didn't lie, the hotel decor and furnishings were magnificent.  We were upgraded (at our cheeky request) to a suite which was very spacious and plush. The view was non existent however as we were at the back of the hotel, but the bonus was zero noise pollution. If you are in the front it's noisy I expect. A highlight was the jazz bar in the basement, drinks are expensive but there is no cover charge which means drinks aren't expensive after all...!! Well worth splashing out on a drink there to enjoy late night jazz, it really was fantastic. Breakfast was a major disappointment for my husband, seemed to be a good selection but quality was only ok. I thought it was alright but nothing memorable, he was unhappy with it however. Other than breakfast the hotel was great, very luxurious, merits the high ratings, is exactly as it looks in the photos and I would recommend the location. Easy airport links, near the metro, near good shopping, restaurants, bars etc. I was happy with it! Would return for a slice of luxury if we got the same online deal - good prices to be found on the travel/hotel wholesaler websites - we got it for a rock bottom price so search!",4,2013,11,03
29,Second visit lived up to expectations,"We would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona. Outstanding from the moment you arrive to when you leave.
They do have a Michelin star restaurant on site - this however was not to our liking and we would not eat here again.",5,2013,11,01
29,A Real palace,"This is a really beautiful place to stay. We had a classic Deluxe room on the 5th floor.  Very spacious.. furnished to a high standard in classic style. The bathroom was very spacious and well appointed as you would expect from a five star hotel.  Downstairs was a joy. Wonderful  lounge with sumptuous couches..marble pillars...cristal chandelairs...the breakfast room was light, airy and equally impressive.  The icing on the cake was the michelin starred restaurant.
Wonderful room, fabulous food and very attentive staff.
It was a pleasure to stay here (only 3 days)........we will be back.",5,2013,10,29
29,great hotel,"good hotel, a little bit expensive, great breakfast, taxis always outside, big rooms, beautiful bathrooms and amenities there should you wish to take advantage of them.  i will definitely go back some time.",4,2013,10,28
29,"So-so accommodation, but great food!","The public areas of the Palace are spacious and beautiful, full of old-world charm.

But our junior suite was a charmless disappointment, with windows so high we had to walk to them to see what view we had.  ( I was surprised that the hotel had no real outdoor space.)  For roughly the first 24 hours of our stay, we had to keep calling the desk and housekeeping for assorted problems:  terrible internet service, no washcloths, a hairdryer that needed replacing. The best thing about our suite--and there were very nice things--was the well-designed space for closet storage and bath.  It made dressing, packing, etc. easier than they often are in hotels.

The restaurants were happier experiences.  The Michelin one-star Caelis served our group a multi-course meal in which every dish a perfection in portion size and taste.  The less fancy 19 offered a diverse menu, and every thing we had in the course of several meals was delicious:  The chicken croquettes and the sea bass made this old Southern girl pretty happy!",4,2013,10,27
29,Disappointed,"I stayed here and informed them that we were celebrating our 29th anniversary, my 57th birthday the day before arrival and my just having just successfully completed chemotherapy and radiation treatment for rectal cancer last month.  They did nothing to acknowledge any of the above.  We had to ask daily for extra towels and ice.  At breakfast, which was in a beautiful room they made sure we understood we were only allowed the continental breakfast and not to go near the hot choices. There was no gift or personal acknowledgement.  They referred to my traveling partner as Mrs. Goldman.  I felt as if we were an imposition.  The room which was large did not have windows you could see through and overlooked the backs of other buildings.  I have to admit I have been spoiled by other leading hotels and their service and have come to expect something that I did not get at the Palace.  
I gave my preferences for a high floor extra towels and foam pillows before I arrived, none were given and had to be asked for.  I was told the hotel was sold out and there were no other rooms to look at.",3,2013,10,26
29,A night to remember!,"On our first night in Spain before our 12 day cruise was set to begin a crowd of us (Canadians from across the country) took a chance an dropped int o this beautiful hotel to have dinner. We had no reservation but were welcomed by (forgive me if I get the names incorrectly) Marsha, Marc and the lovely chef and staff at 19. 

We could not have hoped for a better start to our trip. The food was wonderful and the service beyond compare. We had so much fun and enjoyed the hospitality so very much. Thank you!

We have all decided we will be back to Barcelona and we will stay with you!",5,2013,10,24
29,"Beautiful, Elegant Hotel","My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend. The room was very a good size, double sink bathroom, a king size bed  - very comfortable. (I believe this hotel used to be called 'The Ritz'. I assume it was part of the Ritz group. It has RH in the reception stairway bannisters. The locality is also great! We walked almost everywhere, including Parc Guell, Las Ramblas and Sagrada Familia. We ate in the bar restaurant the first night. The food was very nice, although possible a little too rich (French cuisine). Afterwards we went to the hotel's cocktail bar where there was a live band. We met some really lovely people and had a great time. The staff were friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend this hotel. If you do plan to stay there I suggest you make sure you have the full address to hand, as the taxi driver's don't tend to speak much or any English and there is more than one hotel with part of it's name as 'palace', so you could easily end up at the wrong one, as we did - fortunately it was only a short walk away, but also easily confused.",5,2013,10,18
29,"Great ""Grand Hotel"" in good spot","Superb, spacious room (junior suite) with a lot of amenities. The service is for sure outstanding and the breakfast is upper standard.
We stayed in the hotel for a weekend trip did enjoy the location of the hotel. Close to main spots, either by walk or metro, but still quiet.
We asked the concierge for several restaurant recommendations and we were always pleased and happy.
The hotel is definitely a leading hotel of the world with excellent service and an outstanding atmosphere. As many other mentioned, the breakfast buffet is great - but still not close to the one we could enjoy at Lebua at State Tower in Bangkok.

Having been in Barcelona for several times, this hotel was definitely the best we did stay - but also by far most expensive.
For less money there are other hotels for good value.",4,2013,10,14
29,Magnificient Experience,"We had stayed at the Ritz in London and in my mind I was comparing the two when someone told me it was previously The Ritz.  We have traveled to Europe 22 times and this was one of the finest and most memorable hotels.  Grand salon, outstanding chandeliers, elegance, charm and  many architectural embellishments, even draped portieres.  See if you can find the ""jib door"" in the grand salon.  I like this hotel more than the Ritz in London (too gilded).  Our Jr. Suite had lg walk-in closet, tub, rain shower and double vanities.  The doorman was there EVERY time.  The concierge was outstanding, the best ever.  Most welcoming hotel. Excellent service.",5,2013,10,14
29,A Hotel with a very fine service,"All the staff did their very best to give us an excellent stay at the very nice hotel. The room was very fine, and although the hotel is located at a very busy crossing, the windows had a very fine noise cancelling.

In the bar restaurant we had a Tapas, and the waiter was able to explain the different versions of Tapas form the different parts of Spain.

However, we were disappointed about the scrambled eggs for breakfast. A hotel of this class should offer scrambled eggs made in the kitchen, and not a prefabricated version.",5,2013,10,13
29,Perfect end to a perfect cruise,"Originally called the Ritz, I understand, after the London Ritz. Well I love the London Ritz and I love this hotel too. It was our first stay in Barcelona and this was the perfect place to stay to finish off our holiday after a 10 day cruise. The rooms and en-suite facilities were just to our liking. The food and service in the restaurant also. Like all places in my experience it is the staff that play a big part in making ones stay enjoyable. The staff at El Palace certainly did that.",5,2013,10,11
29,El Palace Hotel Barcelona Spain,This hotel exceeded our expectations. It was situated in a great location.  The lobby was a solace to rest after a long day of sightseeing.  The room was spacious and beautiful.  Every imaginable amenity.  Staff extremely courteous.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2013,10,10
29,Don't waste your money...,"Perhaps I'm a hotel snob, but my expectations of a hotel is directly proportional to the price. This place understands the ""luxury hotel price"", but not what they need to deliver to match that.

Pro
- Good location
- Very helpful concierge
- Room decor did NOT match the lobby (thank goodness)
- Great shower, product
Con
- Lobby/Common area extremely ornate and smelled very stuffy
- Stale breakfast buffet (cold scrambled eggs... ick)
- Wifi? What a joke (at least the front desk admitted to the issue, but still)
- The hotel has no attention to details! All little things, but says something about their state of mind. For example:
	- Mismatched towels: the hotel has multiple styles of towels, some solid, some with embossed stripes. Often we have a mishmash of these two styles
	- The two lights in the bathroom mirror had different density light bulbs, so one side was darker than the other
	- Spotty turn down service: one night our room was being turned down at 12:00am when we returned from dinner, two nights we didn't have any turn down
	- Wash cloths: We asked for wash cloths as there were none, and then again on the second day, an then on third and fourth!",2,2013,10,05
29,"Wonderful staff, property, and location!!","This hotel met our expectations (which are pretty high). We like to walk and were within easy distance of La Rambla, Bari Gotic, Placa Espanol, etc. The staff was very gracious and kind. The room service operator's English was quite weak so we had difficulty understanding our options and getting questions answered. For example, I asked whether the club sandwich had ham on it and the answer was No -- the sandwich had ham on it. Maybe he thought I was asking for him to add ham? Anyway, this was a small price to pay for a wonderful room and everything else was perfect. The bathroom was beautiful -- separate shower and tub...double sinks...separate little room for toilet. I would definitely stay here again if I ever get back to Barcelona!",5,2013,10,02
29,Modern Grand Hotel,"I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Barcelona.   I'm pretty tough on hotels, and this one checked all the right boxes.  It has all the ambiance of a bygone era with modern updated rooms.  I can't sing the praises of this hotel highly enough.  The rooms are large with a sophisticated style that has become the standard for top end hotels, and this hotel does it well.  The lobby is classic old world style which is well maintained.  I didn't try the restaurant but I'm told it's very good.   The hotel staff is very knowledgable about the area, and suggested things for the to see  and do on a free afternoon.  They were also able to find a Michelin rated restaraunt within walking distance that was open for lunch on a Monday (most are closed on Mondays).  While the hotel has a spa (I think it has a fitness center but I didn't see it) it's best to ask at the front desk for a referal elsewhere else.",5,2013,10,02
29,Lovely Hotel,"The Palace Hotel is just lovely and beautiful! The staff cannot do enough for you, they were so incredibly nice and helpful! The room was beautiful, comfortable and soundproof, which is especially nice when you are on a different time zones! The bathroom was amazing with the rainhead shower and the heated towel bars! The location is wonderful for walking to all the old city sights of Barcelona! A really wonderful place to stay!",5,2013,09,28
29,Wonderful Indulgence!,"The Palace offers old world charm that is both Grand and Luxurious!  We stayed 3 nights and were upgraded to a Junior Suite.  The room was beautifully decorated with comfortable beds, even by European standards which are usually hard as a rock.  The bathroom was palatial with a wonderful spa tub, rainfall shower, and Bvlgari toiletries.  The staff were professional, friendly and prompt.  We had excellent WIFI connection throughout our stay.  We did not eat at the restaurant, preferring instead to eat at small local cafes to which there are many within walking distance.  The Concierge was most helpful with suggestions.  The only con would be the fitness room; it is very small and does not offer much.  But, with all the walking you do, it doesn't create much of an issue.  We had a wonderful stay!",5,2013,09,23
29,Customer care from a lost era. Fabulous & life changing experience.,"Joan Valls and his team run such a beautiful hotel that the mind boggles. The building is also beautiful.  The initial beauty I was referring to is the attention to detail and fabulous customer care, which for me is different than service. If you are hesitating because of the price of this hotel  don't. You are paying for a beautiful hotel in a prime location. What you get in addition to this can be found in few hotels across the world and is priceless. 

I am sure that the staff have been hand picked for their depth of knowledge and genuine personalities. The personal touch I will leave for you to discover! 

This is not the Ritz rebranded, this is a hotel hotel that stands in it's own right as one of the top hotels in the world. Oriental Bangkok & Peninsular Hong Kong you have some catching up to do. 

Disclaimer: I am hooked. I have just booked my third stay in as many weeks. It is that good.",5,2013,09,23
29,Great Stay,"We stayed at the hotel for 1 night after finishing a cruise.  The location was close enough to walk to most things we wanted to see and a short cab ride for the rest.  I used the concierge to help with a running route and to find a laundromat as well as dinner locations and they were very helpful and spot on with advice!  We did not have breakfast at the hotel. There was a small cafe across the street with great pastry items and a few tables.  We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite and our room was available for an early 9am check in.  The room and bathroom areas were huge. When we came back to our room, sparkling wine, bottled water and chocolates were waiting for us from management.  The bed was comfortable as well.  It was a great splurge!",5,2013,09,20
29,perfect experience !,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service,great location..it is situated close to the city centre, there are plenty of possibilities within walking distance. I would really appreciate the concierge team's recommendations and service .I highly recommend this hotel without any worry .",5,2013,09,14
29,Definatelly 5 stars,"Hotel was in very good location to main city atttractions - everything was done by foot. Room was spacy enough, with nice view on street (actually not so loud despite FC Barcelona won the game during our stay). Breakfest - very good (specially tomato bread in catalonian style). Overall - everything you expect from 5 stars!",5,2013,09,12
29,overrated and overpriced,"I don't see what the fuss is about this hotel. The staff are poorly trained - housekeeping especially. I had to ask for a blanket for my bed and a washcloth for the bathroom several times before they arrived - the next day. The staff in the lobby bar don't come to serve one - one has to go to look for someone to serve. The musak in the breakfast room is unbearably loud at early hours. The room service menu is more limited than at a budget hotel and very expensive despite that. For a so-called top luxe hotel, this is more like a three star service.",3,2013,09,10
29,Great Hotel- Terrible Internet Connection,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Hotel is nice but if you plan to use internet via wi-fi forget it. It is amazing that $500 per night hotel cannot provide a broadband internet. I spent hours trying to connect only to get disconnected. Number of clicks for nothing. Speed is worse than on my 3g phone. If you have to run business, use Skype, or do any serious exploration of the city on Internet, this is not place to stay. We ended up going to local coffee shop to connect.

Lifts are vey slow and small,like in most European hotels. The concierge desk is very helpful",4,2013,09,08
29,Beautiful hotel,"Very elegant hotel, beautiful room. Location is good, not too far from center of the town. The front desk is a little stiff, and Internet connetion in room is very weak, had to go to lobby to use Internet.",5,2013,09,08
29,Beautiful hotel to stay in,"We only spent one night in Barcelona after our cruise before flying back to the US.
They let us check in early at El Palace.  The room was big, very clean and elegant.  The bathroom was probably one of the largest I have seen with a big roman bath - definitely impressive.
The staff was very courteous.

The breakfast was served in a gorgeous hall, although we thought is was pricey at 28 euro per person, it was a pleasant experience.

We thought the hotel's location was great and central, we mostly walked everywhere.",5,2013,09,07
29,worthy hotel,"it was Ritz before and many people in the city are still recognized this hotel by this name.It is not far from very center of touristic area .The entrance and hall are majestic ,but the lifts and corridor are much more ordinary.I had junior suite and it was equipped with huge  modern bathroom .The rooms are very light ,what is not often possible to meet now.Comfortable bed and different pillows by order.The breakfast was rather simple ,but in very nice place and the environment  had compensated the food.

A few words about Caelis restaurant -they worst  my experience in Spain.The ordered steak Rossini was served beautifully, looked beautiful with pink cut, but it was absolutely inedible because of the rubber hard meat.I refused to eat  it ,but instead of excuse i had heard  ""it is your problem"".I left the restaurant after that  ( was hurry for a meeting) and my wife with a 3 year old child  left for dessert .The maitre did not let up with  desire to spoil the evening. We were finally brought usual English breakfast instead  of elite tea bag without complimentary candies like on the other tables and finally forced a tired wife with a child  to wait for the bill 30 minutes until my wife simply stood up directing the door. They called this selfish  Spanish guy,  brave and arrogant with  women Alain Benteo. He refused to eat this meat himself ,but put it on my bill.

They have not bad, often empty ,restaurant for lunch ,located in a nice hall.They have Good wi-fi and computers on the ground floor.

Special thanks to  Celine,very  friendly guest relation manager.",5,2013,09,06
29,"If you want the best in barcelona, this is the best period",This is by far the best hotel I have been in! even compared to the 7 star hotels in Dubai. -The staff team are incredible -Concierge is among the best you can find -Location is perfect -The hotel gives off the vibe that you are staying in a premium royal palace -Perfect place for newly weds and family -Every minute of my stay there the staff put all their efforts to make me feel like royalty and never let me down on any of my requests. -My next forthcoming stays in Barcelona will be in this hotel,5,2013,09,06
29,El Palace Hotel,"Beautiful place,gorgeous bathrooms, large bedrooms-really felt like a 5 star hotel! Close to shopping and walking to Las Rambles.  Arrived early but did not get room until 3 o'clock.  Walked to a  nearby restaurant in the evening (concierge recommended) and it was wonderful and moderately priced.  Enjoyed our stay just wish it had been longer.  I'd stay there again.",5,2013,09,04
29,El Palace Barcelona,"Absolutely stunning hotel. Stayed here after 10 days of cycling from Biaaritz to Barcelona so the comfort and luxury was really appreciated. The hotel rooms were huge and very luxurious. Hotel was very central to all attractions. I would definitely stay here again. We definitely want to visit Barcelona again, so will earmark El Palace as a place of choice to stay.",5,2013,09,03
29,Perfect pre cruise hotel,My husband and I stayed here for one night pre cruise. We arrive two hours before check in bleary eyed after traveling from west coast. They were so nice and helpful. gave us a small room to change& shower. The room we stayed in was beautiful and luxurious. We slept very well and then woke up to have the wonderful Sunday brunch. I highly recommend doing the brunch.. We then got a taxi to head to the port which was less than 10 mins by taxi. I would stay here again.,5,2013,09,03
29,Very good place to stay with kids!,"Up to now I've been to this hotel twice and hope to return there again. Wonderful atmosphere, perfect management, very good attitude to small children. Their breakfast is perfect with Spanish Cava, smoked salmon and fresh fruit. And don't miss the opportunity to visit Caelis restaurant, marked with 2 michelin stars. My kids enjoyed their dessert Chocolate Explosion. It was the best show ever seen!",5,2013,09,03
29,"Old world charm, but average before it was renovated.","Looking for a different type of hotel from the sleek and chic ones we normally book, my husband and I decided to stay in El Palace Barcelona, before it was renovated (so this review is slightly off-tangent). Built in 1919, it had all the old world charm and European opulence and grandness befitting of a palace. Our room was huge - there were literally so many different doors around, I once accidentally walked into a wardrobe! We were pleasantly surprised that a bottle of wine with a message from the manager himself awaited us in the room. Because it was really in need of upgrading and renovations, we found the room a tad tired-looking and worn-out and the bathroom in particular need for more up-to-date plumbing and fittings. Well, it is pleasing to know that they are completely renovated and refurbished. Their location is great, not quite smack on Las Ramblas, just slightly away from the noise and bustle of the centre, but not far either; so it's ideal.",3,2013,09,02
29,fantastic former ritz,"Loved every second of it. The suite they gave us was fantastic with a beautiful view. The staff especially the guest relations manager extremely nice and helpful. I took a cab over to look at a room after an unsatifactory night at the arts hotel. I checked out immediately and checked in here. The restaurant in the hotel is a ichelin star restaurant and I loved it. One of the nicer restauarnts I have eaten at. Would love ane excuse to stay here again,",5,2013,09,01
29,Wonderful stay both times!,"We stayed here two separate times in August - before and after a cruise and we were really very happy with both stays.  Check in was welcoming, quick (which was nice because we had had a long trip there) and organized.  We arrived at 8am and were happily advised that our rooms were ready. We stayed in both a junior suite and standard room. Rooms were in pristine, well appointed condition.  Junior suites face a quieter courtyard and there was some street noise in the standard rooms but not too much.  Bathrooms were really nice with lovely jacuzzi tubs.  The public areas of the hotel were beautifully kept and we also had breakfast included in our stay which is in a lovely breakfast room and food was good.  However, as beautiful as this hotel was, I think the thing that made both our stays here out of the ordinary were the people who work here.  They are wonderful!  The concierge gave us many LOVELY places to eat for lunch or tapas for dinner.  Please ask them for recommendations because the places never disappointed.  We had a problem with tickets to a museum and I believe her name was Katerina was so helpful in sorting it out.  She even offered to take us down to the ATM to print out our tickets.  Every employee we encountered went above and beyond and I think that was what impressed me the most.  Don't get me wrong, the surroundings are spectacular as well.  This is a really special place and I hope we will get the opportunity to return.",5,2013,08,29
29,Fab!,"Great location and fab service. The hotel looked dated in the photos and I was worried but when we got there we realised it was just grand and there was nothing dated about this place. 

The staff are super friendly and the customer service supassed all expectations.

Rooms are very clean and ridiculously comfortable and spacious. There's a pillow menu upon arrival too.

Cons - the hotel offered a DVD service but when the DVD player came we were told that it didn't connect to the TV so it seemed a pointless service to offer. The hotel did try to redeem themselves by offering a small tv to connect it to and said it was something they were working towards. Fair enough it wasn't the be all and end all.

Mini bar prices and breakfast was very expensive. Wanted to eat in the restaurant one night which has one Michelin star but was shut on Sunday and Monday and had little for a vegetarian.

Lastly the maids just walk in on you every moment of every day. Despite saying no. The only way to stop this is to place the do not disturb sign up.

Other than this I couldn't really fault the hotel. You get a turn down service every night, clean towels twice a day and lots of English TV channels which was a touch because we got to see Eastenders before dinner!

All in all I felt like I was staying in a palace. Every little detail is thought of including a toothbrush and toothpaste.

It's also very central toeverything including a metro station up the road.

Have a wonderful stay. I will be coming back soon.

",5,2013,08,27
29,Simply fantastic!,El Palace Barcelona is truly an outstanding hotel from the time you are greeted to be checked in you really feel like being a palace. The hotel staff is extremely curtious and helpful. They really made our stay a joy. The hotel is almost walking distance to all the touristy places but far enough from all the noise and crowds. We will definitely go back to this beautiful hotel!,5,2013,08,26
29,First Class,"Our family of 4 stayed in 2 adjoining rooms on the top floor of the El Palace hotel at the start of a 2 week vacation in August.  This was an expensive undertaking, and luckily we feel like it was worth it.  The rooms are large and luxurious. The concierge desk is staff by the most friendly, helpful and knowledgeable people I have ever come across in a hotel. Truly outstanding.  
On our last evening my husband and I had an extraordinary meal at Caelis while the kids enjoyed reasonably priced room service upstairs.  
The breakfast is expensive, but the room is so lovely that we splurged every morning.  Normally, getting the children out of bed to go to a restaurant for breakfast would be a challenge, but not at El Palace.  
One other thing that bears emphasis. The hotel smells wonderful.  You have the feeling of being pampered just walking down a hallway. Other reviewers have commented and I cannot agree more that the scent is heavenly.  I have never come across a hotel with a signature scent before, but El Palace does it right!",5,2013,08,25
29,Just fantastic!,"I wanted to say to the staff of El Palace, a giant thank you for making my stay with you so pleasant.  I'll admit I had some trepidation - I thought the hotel was going to be a bit stuffy - but that very quickly went away when I arrived.  Particular points of note:

- location - Being right on Grand Via - unbeatable
- service - even when I turned up at 4am half plastered.
- very quick twice a day room cleaning/turn down service, complete with dark chocolate.
- the breakfast buffet - probably the best orange juice in Barcelona.
- the rainshower - especially when I turned up at 4am half plastered.
- the scent - there's something very pleasant and not-overpowering about the way the main areas smell. What is it...?
- the room - top floor in the corner with a balcony.  I want the same room next year!

I wish you had a pool though...

Thank you again.  See you in 2014!",5,2013,08,22
29,Best martini ever,"The location was great. When we arrived they gave us tea and cake in our room.
Needed to talk to the airline, but don't speak Spanish and the guys at concierge made the call for me and helped sort out a problem.
They do make the best vodka martini in the lounge downstairs.
Had a great time in Barcelona",5,2013,08,17
29,LOVED El Palace,"Beautiful hotel, elegant and luxurious, with excellent service. Location is wonderful.  The TV is hidden in a mirror over the fireplace. We spent two weeks traveling around Spain and our two nights spent at El Palace were our two of our best.",5,2013,08,14
29,5 Class Service,"This hotel was by far our favorite on our European vacation. Large spacious room, excellent bathroom set up (luxurious shower and deep bathtub, double sinks and separate toilet stall), and hidden amenities such as the minibar behind a picture frame and tv hidden in a mirror. The hotel itself was very luxurious and very welcoming as well. Prices were great compared to what I would have paid in a large city for the same type of service. Location of everything was close as well (Passeig de Gracia/ Placa de Catalunya/ Ramblas/ Casa Batllo/ Casa Mila/ Hop on Hop Off locations/ Metro). If you are staying in Barcelona, I would recommend this hotel hands down!",5,2013,08,12
29,Service of the highest quality!,"Stepping into this hotel is like stepping into a bygone age...not only because of the beautiful decor from La Belle Epoque but also because the service harps back to those times. It is hard to describe, but the service was impeccable - not over the top and in your face, but very careful and thoughtful and ""there"" when you need it. Not something you get very often but you certainly appreciate it when you do. I would definitely stay here again just for that!

Food: breakfast was an extensive buffet constantly refreshed. If you want to eat in the Michelin starred restaurant, book well in advance of your trip.

Location: on the main boulevard and so a bit of a walk into the old part of town and the habour area. 

Note that there is another hotel with a similar name and taxi drivers can sometimes get confused.",5,2013,08,10
29,one of the best ever seen,"we stayed 5 nights in a suite in the hotel. it is a very good place to stay: the hotel is great, the room was very nice (fantastic bathroom), and: it's located in the middle of the city. great!
you must try the breakfast: unbelieveable!!",5,2013,08,03
29,Sleepless in Barcelona,"I will start my review on a positive note...location-fantastic, mint tea-great. Did I mention that the location was great? I thought I was staying in Barcelona, but my PTSD said I was trapped in a Vegas hotel. We had cigarette smoke enter our room >85% of our stay through the A/C unit. This made having a good night's rest a challenge. At least we had windows that actually worked. I was also disturbed by the practice of turning our key into the front desk every time you leave the hotel. No one and I do mean no one, ever asked us for ID to verify if we were the current occupants of the room. I'm just saying...we weren't in Kansas anymore. The only saving grace for this hotel...LOCATION!!",3,2013,08,01
29,"Beautiful property, but was disappointed by room and some surly staff members!","On entering the hotel you are warmly welcomed by door staff and efficiently directed to the reception, where I have to say standards dropped dramatically.  The rather unfriendly tall gentleman seemed irritated that we had arrived so early from South East Asia, and did little to make us feel truly welcomed.  Once checked in we enjoyed coffee in the beautifully decorated main salon.  After a four hour wait we got our room and whilst it was very well decorated, it did not meet our expectations when comparing to hotels such as Claridges or The Dorchester in London.  The bathroom was dark and the towels could not be described as luxurious.  The main restaurant and cocktail bar was closed on both nights we stayed at the hotel.  Concierge staff were very helpful in recommending restaurants and were also happy to chat with us about possible daily itineraries.  We used the hotel Mercedes car to get to the hotel and this was a real treat.  Would I stay again? Probably not, as there are so many other great hotels in Barcelona to choose from....having been to Barcelona so many times, I feel this property has been rather over-rated on this site and certainly is not great value. given the lack of swimming pool and closure of the cocktail bar and restaurant on two nights a week!",4,2013,08,01
29,"Beautiful old world hotel, newly renovated!","Great location, beautiful hotel, wonderful staff! Our mini suite was just beautiful! Large luxury modern marble bathroom, large walk in closet, 2 comfortable beautiful rooms, great bed! 
I read a review about smoking in the lobby, we were there for dinner as well and there was NOT a person smoking! I never smelled smoke any place in the hotel! 
We all enjoyed our deluxe beautiful rooms and would definetly come back. We were only there for one night but it could not have been better! 
Great Hotel!",5,2013,08,01
29,Great hotel,"The hotel is the old Ritz Carlton and is situated in a good and quiet location 5 minutes walk from the Plaza de Catalunya at the top end of Las Ramblas and the old City. 
Easy walk to Casa Batllo, La Pedrera and shopping.
The rooms and bathroom are big and the bed very comfortable.
The property is immaculate and the breakfast buffet is very good.
Well prized for the quality you get.",5,2013,07,31
29,Palace Gl Hotel Barcelona Spain,"We having been traveling all over the world for 40 years and are really very fussy.We pay for luxury and expect it. 
We loved the Palace hotel in Barcelona. The Lobby is gorgeous,it has a 1 star Michelin Star restaurant in the hotel as well as a lovely breakfast room and another restaurant. 
We all had mini suites that were beautiful,comfortable ,and had the most wonderful bath products. The bathrooms were beautiful marble rooms.
The location was great.Would highly recommend,but do not eat in the regular restaurant.Service was very slow,took 2 hours to get main course..we sent it back and didn't have dinner.
No other complaints and would definitely stay there again,but not have dinner.",5,2013,07,26
29,Could be better,"The hotel is 2 blocks to main street P.Gracia and the best attractions Casa Batllo, la Pedrera, etc. The rooms are small and the hotel looks like a museum,the service is good and the staff is attentive.",4,2013,07,22
29,VISIT TO BARCELONA,El palace location is central and great to explore central barcelona. We choose this hotel because it is one of the leading hotels of the world and we were not disappointed. Service was great and rooms were great. We were upgraded to a suite and the room was spacious and were were treated with chocolates and sparkling wine. The spa was expensive but the treatment were great.,4,2013,07,22
29,Beautiful Hotel,My husband and I were spending a few days in Barcelona before cruising the Mediterranean.  It was really hard to find a hotel that would meet our needs.  We chose El Palace and were more than satisfied.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful.  The staff was more than helpful and went out of the way to make our stay very enjoyable.  We would definitely stay here again and hope to be back in Barcelona next summer.  We look forward to our stay at El Palace.  Absolutely a highlight of our trip.  Well worth the stay.,5,2013,07,21
29,First Class Barcelona Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at the El Palace Hotel for three nights and couldn't be happier with our decisions to stay there. We normally don’t stay at ‘5 Star’ hotels, but given this was the final stay of our three week European vacation, we decided to go for it and very glad we did.

As mentioned in many of the reviews, the property and rooms are well maintained and reasonably priced for the location and the amenities. We were upgraded to a suite upon our arrival without asking. The staff, particularly David and Tony, were very helpful, accommodating, and friendly.

In a nice and safe area, we spent the day walking to all the ‘tourist’ sites and enjoyed coming back to a clean and comfortable room at the end of the day.

For our last night in Barcelona, we had dinner at the hotel’s 19/NINETEEN Restaurant and then drinks and live music at the Bar Rien de Rien, both of which I highly recommend. The staff for both the restaurant and the bar were professional yet friendly and helped to make this experience one we won’t soon forget.

I would definitely recommend the El Palace Hotel for anyone looking for a more upscale stay in beautiful Barcelona, and hope to return some day.",5,2013,07,19
29,Location is Outstanding,"We found the location of the Palace to be wonderful.  It is a quick walk to the gothic quarter as well as the  restaurants and shops.  The Breakfast buffet was very good and the staff friendly and helpful.  Only complaints were the beds were very hard and not too comfortable.  Even though we faced the main street our room was very quiet.  In any case, next time I am in Barcelona I will stay there again!",5,2013,07,18
29,Elegance in Barcelona,"Although we only stayed at this Hotel on night it couldn't have been nicer.  We arrived in the morning and our room wasn't quite ready.  We had a lovely breakfast in the beautiful garden room which we really enjoyed.  The Hotel is stately and of an older style.  What I really liked was the large yet intimate lobby and the concierge desk where they couldn't wait to help us.  The location is also great - you feel like you're slightly off the track (10 min from La Romba), but you aren't.  You're right in the middle of everything, but it's quiet and you can walk everywhere.  Our room was ready soon after we ate breakfast, so we were able to check in and take a long walk around the City.  Because of this our one night in Barcelona actually felt like two full days.  Thanks for a great stay.",5,2013,07,18
29,Excellent hotel for tobacco tolerant people,"Stayed 5 nights in this hotel
Excellent: location, restaurant design and food, bathroom design, beds, room service, quietness, polite personell
Depressing: Thick curpets on the floors look as if they have been there since 1970s, look worn out and untidy. Most likely, they are clean, but who will take samples and analyze?
Terrible: the AC system is designed in a such avway, that if somebody in this hotel smokes (formally, it is forbidden)the rest feel it as if a smoker is in their bedroom. We had it 4 nights out of 5 and had to turn down the AC and open the windows. Thank God, the early July nights were fantastic. But what to do in August or January?
I think this hotel is one star less than they claim for the reasons above
",3,2013,07,18
29,Perfect Barcelona City Hotel,"This is a very nice Hotel in an excellent location of Barcelona City.  It is close to shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions and close by taxi to Barceloneta Beach.  As a Leading Hotels of the World Member we appreciated the upgrade to a suite, the complimentary continental breakfast, the wi-fi and very generous welcome snacks and drinks.  Our room was large, very clean and had the most comfortable bed.  The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job in cleaning the room and accommodated our evening turn down service for a later time.   There is a very nice lobby and the restaurants at this hotel are excellent.  The staff is also excellent at this hotel.  There is one particular staff member whose name we believe is Celine (originally from France) and who has been working at this hotel for 10 years who stands out and shines because she is so warm, pleasant, helpful, kind and goes the extra mile for all guests.  She makes you feel immediately welcome and made sure everything was pefect throughout our stay.  We also appreciated the late check out provided to us.   I would not hesitate to stay here again.  

(Although this has nothing to do with the hotel, be cautious with taxi drivers all over Barcelona as most of them will take advantage of you and overcharge if you are not familiar with going rate.  The hotel is very helpful at arranging a taxi for you and are of great assistance in terms of making sure drivers don't rip you off.)",5,2013,07,16
29,Excellent old-fashioned service,"We loved El Palace. Some may not like it's fussy, over-decorated style, but we enjoyed the old world charm (but not dated, it's been renovated) and the excellent service. It's a true 5-star hotel. The rooms are not as OTT as the lobby and restaurant areas. Our bathroom (in a one-bedroom suite) was in fact extremely modern. And HUGE. The maid service was excellent, the breakfast buffet expensive but also extensive. The concierges were all very helpful - one managed to change our booking at Tickets at the last minute, an admirable feat! 
The hotel is also in an excellent location for doing what you need to do in Barcelona - walk! We enjoyed El Palace and love Barcelona. It's not cheap, but if you want luxury and service, this is the place. (For reference, we are in our mid-50s and travel frequently).",5,2013,07,13
29,1st class experience,"The hotel is fabulously ornate yet comfortable. Our room was luxuriously appointed, including the spa-like bathroom.  The staff was very helpful and friendly at every turn, even making great recommendations for local dining and entertainment.   The location was perfect - near excellent shopping and dining, and close to the plazas where you can easily catch the metro, hail a cab, or hop on one of the many tour buses.  Do not miss the quaint jazz club located on the lowest level of the hotel!  It is cozy and intimate, the live music was lovely, and those bartenders really make delicious and creative cocktails!   After a day of artistic and sensory overload (which was EVERY day of our trip to Barcelona)you will be glad you are staying at this peaceful and gloriously   beautiful hotel.",5,2013,07,11
29,fabulous staff,"The hotel was extremely well located near good restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The rooms were in excellent condition and looked like they had recently been redone. The staff was very helpful. I was very impressed.",5,2013,07,08
29,"A fabulous hotel, with even more fabulous staff","Location – The Hotel is very well located on Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which is one of the main avenues of Barcelona.  It runs parallel to the sea, and the hotel is only 7-8 min by taxi from the Barcelona Sants train station.  It is a 5-8 min walk from Placa Catalunya which is the northern start of Las Ramblas.  There are at least 4 Metro stops of 3 metro lines within 2 blocks of the hotel.  We also walked/strolled from our hotel to Casa Batllo, La Pedrera (Casa Milo), and the Sagrada Familia.

Building – The building itself is, of course, the former Ritz hotel.  What a grand hotel.  It is remarkably beautiful on the inside with the old-style (fabulously redone) staircases, and the majestic lounge/hall area.  You get the feeling of walking through a CLASSIC hotel, NOT an old hotel.  It has been maintained, or restored, impeccably. 

Arrival / Reception – We arrived from the train station (AVE from Madrid) by Taxi and were greeted by a doorman (long coat & top hat), who actually looked happy to see us.  At that point we were taken care of in a very pleasing fashion.  As I checked my family in, Celine, the guest services manager, inquired about our plans and gave my wife some suggestions to help us with our stay, showing us on the map where our desired attractions were located and the best method for getting there.  Our room wasn’t ready yet (10am), so they held our luggage for us.  We visited the Musee Picasso while we waited for our room, and upon return our room (upgraded) was ready.  

Room – We walked into a large room (by even American standards, much less European, or even Barcelonan) with beautiful furnishings.  Again, the room is in a very classic style, with the heavy drapes and fabric wall coverings.  However, the room has all modern features, including free WiFi, (yeah) and flatscreen TV (tastefully mounted on the wall).

Bathroom – Our bathroom was gorgeous.  It had a whirlpool tub that was separate from the large shower with overhead rain faucet.  My wife and daughter both enjoyed the use of the whirlpool.  The L´Occitane en Provence amenities and luxurious towels, robes and slippers highlight why this is a 5 star hotel.

Bar – I wanted some beverages for us to enjoy in our luxurious room after our long day of touring Barcelona, and so walked down to the Bar / jazz lounge to see what it looked like.  It is a very quaint lounge with good ambiance.  At the time, they had music playing but a live performance would start later.  The bartender made excellent drinks.

Staff – I left the best for last.  Everything about this hotel is so well done, you would think that the people that worked there would be stiff or uncaring, as in many higher-end hotels, but they are not.  They are the exact opposite.  I have never met a staff so interested in ensuring we had a great stay.  When I was having difficulties booking my tickets to the Sagrada Familia for the next day, (do this to avoid the long lines), I went downstairs to ask Alexis, the fantastic concierge, for advice.  He simply whipped out a credit card, made my family reservation and printed out the tickets.  I paid him for the tickets and was extremely grateful for the service.  He seemed happy to do it.  Every person we came in contact with at the hotel was genuinely happy to help.  What a refreshing change.

Wrapup – Obviously we had a great stay at a great hotel.  When we return to Barcelona, we won’t even look at another hotel.  El Palace is where we will be staying.  I wish all hotel experiences could be like this.",5,2013,07,07
29,EXELLENT SERVICE,"Good afternoon, I stayed in the Palace a month ago and every thing was absolutely excellent. I have to say the room was great, Mr Xavi the bellman was so so helpful all the time, also Mr Alejandro from concierge was giving us some advices, Mr Victor from reception was so kind to my husband and myself and I would like to thanks Mrs Katharina she is wonderful, she made our stay so so unforgettable, she booked for us the Miramar Hotel for the next day and she called us back to make sure we had a god stay in the pool.
I definetely recommend this Hotel yo my friends and the team made our celebration more than perfect. Thanks Katharina for arranging everything for us.
Thanks The Palace Mr and Mrs Husban",5,2013,07,06
29,Superb Spanish experience pre-cruise from Barcelona,"The hotel is a former ‘Ritz’ property, beautifully maintained and kept in its grandeur and polish, everything that the photographs offer is completely delivered by this building. Its location is a great balance, not too central to be manic and noisy yet still in easy 5 mins walking distance from all of the central Barcelona sights and landmarks. We took a luxury room on 4th floor, with a ‘Juliet’ balcony and sunken ‘Roman’ bath, the room was excellent, quiet [despite being on the front] and very comfortable. The staff were unobtrusive, helpful and knowledgeable. All that you could wish for in an excellent property and a superb pre-cruise stopover. We will return some day I am certain.",5,2013,07,05
29,Perfect Stay,"I was there for one night on business.  The hotel was extremely well located near good restaurants, nightlife and shopping.  The rooms were in excellent condition and looked like they had recently been redone.  The staff was very helpful.  I was very impressed.",5,2013,06,30
29,"Elegant , centrally located hotel.","I stayed here for one night whilst on business in Barcelona. The hotel is quite convenient as it is located a short distance (5-10 minutes walk) from the Ramblas. 

The reception area is small but staff are extremely efficient and friendly (as were the bell staff). I was taken to my room and shown how to use everything. 

The room itself was very elegant. It had a wonderful old fireplace and a fantastic bed. Despite the old world charm the room had great modern conveniences, from the multiple telephones to the television which was behind the mirror. 

The bathroom was splendid. There was a double sink, nice deep bath and separate rainfall shower. 

I had dinner at one of he restaurants. The food looked fantastic but i have simple tastes so it was a bit too ""gastro sciency"" for me.",5,2013,06,28
29,A Pefect Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at El Palace. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  (And everyone speaks English at the front desk). Check in was a breeze. Our room (classic deluxe) was spacious, clean, comfortable, and quiet! We were just off the busy Corts Catalanes and with the windows closed, I never heard the traffic.  The bed was extremely comfortable, especially for me since I have a bad back and need a firm support, and the choice of pillows helped a lot with neck support. The bathroom was wonderful - plenty of room to hang your clothes, and had double sinks, decent lighting, great shower. We went twice to the downstairs bar to listen to music (available after 11 pm) and had a great time. Loved their salon area off the lobby- beautiful and comfortable spot to relax and have a drink and relax. The location is perfect - walking distance to mostly everything. This area - the Eixample, is the best part of Barcelona to stay in. Just north east of the hotel is Sagrada Familia and from there you can take a cab to Park Gruell. A few blocks west of the hotel is P de Gracia where you can find all the best shops, Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, and countless restaurants, cafes, and tapas. Just a few blocks south is the Palau de la Musica Catalana and south west is the start of La Rambla into the Gothic quarter. I felt very safe walking to and from the hotel. Would stay there again if I revisit Barcelona in the future and highly recommend it. 

SCAM WARNING: I was unaware of all the scams that are prevalent in Barcelona (said to have the best thieves and pickpockets in the world). Do not fall for the bird poo scam as we did. We were walking near the beach area, cutting through a park, and were approached by a man and woman exclaiming we had been hit by bird droppings. As they cleaned us up, the man removed my husband's wallet from a front pocket and got off with 500$ in US and euros. Thankfully he replaced the wallet with credit cards, license, etc intact. and didn't steal our camera or anything else. But we were upset and shaken when we discovered it minutes later, and all the wiser!  Read up on the common scams before you go! Wish I had.",5,2013,06,18
29,The old Ritz hotel --NICE,Very very nice hotel - worth every penny . Great and very helpful staff . the room was spacious and a comfortable -- Luxury at its best -- we will go back -- Very well situated in a very nice part of Barcelona - we walk every where and enjoyed our home away from home --,5,2013,06,16
29,"Beyond expectations, and worth every penny.","We had a wonderful time at El Palace Hotel. The staff was fantastic, very friendly, and very helpful. Celine, manager of guest services, met us as we checked in, took us to the lounge area for a coffee since our room wasn't ready (we arrived at 10AM from JFK, via Seattle), explained the highlights of the city with map detail. What a wonderful way to arrive!! We stayed for 6 nights, and can honestly tell you that this is one of our favorite hotels. Every service is given with a smile. It is evident that they are all very well trained and that everyone is happy to be working there. Celine and her staff offer wonderful recommendations for every need you have. We didn't have any disappointments!! By the way, the room was wonderful, bathroom huge, shower great, beds fantastic, and quiet and peaceful even though you are in a convenient location to everything in the city. Highly recommend!!!

29,"One day at el Palace, very happy!","Came in yesterday from Houston. Arrived at hotel around 1:00 pm. Rooms not ready for 30 minutes. Staff very helpful from doorman to front desk to concierge. Treated very nice, staff responded to requests without fail. Breakfast buffet very good with all types of food. Free wifi throughout. Has feel of grand hotel!  Off tomorrow to cruise and return afterwards back to el palace. Would highly recommend.",5,2013,06,14
29,The way I'd like to live,"This is obviously not a cheap hotel but it is worth every penny for the experience.

It is very classical in it's approach with staff at every turn to take care of all your needs. There is a lot of marble, brass and guilding that gives the feel of history, yet they have kept up with the times and all the mod cons will be tastefully hidden away in your room. Our junior suite lacked a view but was a great base to have in Barcelona.

The bar/nightclub in the basement is 'intimate/tiny' but has great live music and knowledgeable bar staff  who will make you any cocktail you can imagine.

If you live this life all the time why not try the Dali suite if you normally have more down to earth tastes but fancy a treat I truly recommend a stay. It's good enough for Ronnie Wood!",5,2013,06,12
29,Superb!,"Our three night stay at this hotel  could not be faulted. The hotel was indeed a palace; luxurious elegance in all areas. We were particularly impressed by the breakfast in the huge, light and airy  conservatory, the opulent and relaxing, lounge area, the high standard of the hotels' cuisine as well as the courtesy,friendliness and proactive helpfulness of all the staff we had the pleasure to meet, particularly the concierge and the waiters in the bar and 19 restaurant lounge area. Our room was large, very well planned with a modern spacious dressing, shower and bath area. The bed was extremely comfortable so that we got three excellent nights' sleep and with no noise disturbance. The location was brilliant, within walking distance of La Rambla, the Gothic quarter, La Sagrada Familia and the waterfront. We highly recommend this hotel and hope to be back staying there again soon, as there is so much more we want to see in the vibrant and beautiful city of Barcelona and this hotel for us, is the perfect place to stay!.

29,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","These three words completely summarize our stay at this old world but recently updated hotel. it also describes how we felt about the hotels location, its food, and the attentive service. My wife, two teenage daughters and I stayed here pre-cruise for two nights. We would highly recommend this hotel. It's part of the leading Hotels of the World Collection and its very evident as to why it belongs to this prestigious group of hotels. The concierge team provided great tour and restaurant advice that highlighted both the city and its culinary strengths.   The hotel is centrally located which made getting around either a short walk or a quick cab ride. We will plan to stay here upon our next visit to this beautiful.

Thanks for such a wonderful stay.",5,2013,06,02
29,Palatial view of Barcelona,"What a great way to see the city of Barcelona. The hotel itself is very styish and beautiful. The staff cannot do enough for you. Eating in the hotel is an absolute delight.  Their mitchelin star restaurant is sheer artwork. There is a fabulous cocktail bar / lounge for evening entertainment. I cannot wait to return. A central location to see the delights of Barcelona, but with a serving of  indulgent luxury.",5,2013,05,26
29,Beautiful but hang onto your wallet,"We booked two nights but changed our plan to arrive one day early.
We had our travel agent book an extra night at the same rate but on check out found that they were charging an extra 60 euro for the additional night (60 euro above the nightly rate for the second two nights)

We had a plane to catch and the fellow at the counter was very unhelpful in resolving the problem so we just paid and left.  Perhaps we will be reimbursed somehow but I am not counting on it.

Also beware that somehow they have rigged the wifi so that you cannot get email unless you pay an extra 10 euro per day.  I have never encountered this before.  I can even get free email at McDonalds 

The hotel is beautiful and  everyone but the cashier was very helpful.  However I left with the feeling that even though we had agreed to pay a high price to begin with, they were looking for ways to extract even more money.",2,2013,05,24
29,Review of Bar Rien de Rien,"Amazingly atmospheric bar - red velvet, soft lighting (very Moulin Rouge) but small and quaint with an exceptional barman. A great place for a pre dinner drink or for live music (Blues-jazz-soul) after 11pm. Highly recommended.",5,2013,05,23
29,"Great hotel, good location","Stayed for a business meeting and also for visiting the Ramblas, waterfront, Olympic parks, etc.  Very nice room, great staff.  Only compliant is the elevators:  i was on the 6th floor (what we North Americans might think of as the 8th floor counting ground and mezzanine) and i did get by exercise on the very nice stairways.

The downstairs bar was fun for the evening and the live music Thursday night was great.",4,2013,05,20
29,"Tip first, ask questions later!","El Palace is elegant, well located, has incredible beds and well appointed rooms.  
Tip the concierge first or they look at you as if you have 2 heads.
Also, turn down service was skipped one night of our 4 night stay, and I had to chase down a housekeeper for toilet paper, shampoo, and towels.    Not 5 star service, sorry.
Lastly, if 2 ply toilet paper exists anywhere in Spain, please use it.",4,2013,05,18
29,A Palace,"We spent four nights at this lovely hotel. It is 2 blocks away from the premier shopping street in Barcelona, another short block to the major department store and one more block to Las Ramblas if that is your style. Probably not if you enjoy the refined luxury of this hotel. No complaints with staff, concierge and food service - all were excellent. Our room was wonderful and the shower was incredible - room for at least 4 people at one time! Enjoy this hotel.",5,2013,05,15
29,5 stars for the Bar Hall and the 19/ restaurant,"Myself and two friends had tapas and a glass of wine at the 19/nineteen restaurant & Bar Hall part of the Palace Hotel.
Tapas were average and the glass of wine was nice but the extraordinary setting of this first class old world luxury hotel made our experience one of a life time memory.
Nowhere else in the world have we had the opportunity to be able to experience old world luxuries like thick comfortable seatings, enough empty space between the tables to isolate group of persons one from another without the feel of other presence right next to ourselves. 
Not really meant for romances more likely for casual business encounters or power leverage negociations.",5,2013,05,13
29,Barcelona Luxury Hotel,"I highly recommend the El palace hotel in Barcelona. It is well located for exploring the restaurants, markets, and shops along the La Rambla. The rooms and service were excellent. I found the food at the hotel to be average, but with so many great restaurants nearby by who cares. We had a suite that had a nice sitting area along with a spacious bedroom. The architectural infrastructure of the hotel was a hold over from when it was a Ritz. The nightclub downstairs was a pleasent surprise with a great bar and superb entertainment. Sitting is limited in the nightclub so try to arrive before 9:00 P.M. if possible.",5,2013,05,13
29,Very grand hotel,"This is a very grand hotel and everything about it says luxury. From the time we walked in we were given 5 star service. Check in was quick but because we arrived in the morning our room was not ready yet. We decided to have breakfast and by the time we finished we were told we could go to our room. The gentleman who showed us to the room took time to show us how everything worked and where everything was. The room was clean and although it felt really small for what we were paying, it was luxurious. The bed is big and comfortable, and although we were staying on the side of the busy main road, the noise was totally blocked out ensuring we got a good rest. 

Location is good on Gran Via which is one of the big streets in Barcelona and from here we could walk to Passeig de Gracia and also walked to La Sagrada Familia. I recommend this hotel if you prefer to go to a quiet hotel after a busy day of sightseeing.",5,2013,05,09
29,Best location in Barcelona!,"Easy to walk to almost everything important from The Palace Hotel in Barcelona (used to be the Ritz).  From very comfortable rooms to delicious breakfasts (the maitre d is superb, a true professional) plus top-notch staff that makes your stay perfect.",5,2013,05,07

29,Gorgeous Luxury Hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in April (2 nights without the children).  The staff are friendly and attentive.  The breakfast was very good, however in my opinion, the scrambled eggs were undercooked so I ordered an omelette instead (which they cook for you), this was undercooked too.  I waited 40 minutes from ordering the omelette and had to send it back, I waited and waited and in the end gave up waiting as we had to leave.
when we arrived the remote control for the TV didn't work, but the staff were very fast in replacing the batteries in the remote. 
A short while after we arrived, we received a delivery of a bottle of Cava and a box of chocolates, which was rather confusing as we hadn't ordered it, so we assumed that it was complimentary.  It was only when we returned to pick up our young children (from my parents), that they asked if we had received their surprise!  It was a shame that the note that the message that my mother had requested to be attached to the gift was never delivered. 
Despite all the above, the hotel has a wow factor, the staff are friendly and very helpful and the room that we had was gorgeous.",4,2013,05,07
29,"""First Class Old World Luxury""","Conveniently located near the ""Ramblas"" and the Gothic section of Barcelona, Old World luxury awaits you at El Palace. The formerly Ritz hotel building was recently renovated keeping the elegance and charm of its facade and interior public areas. We loved the personalized service given by their most courteous staff attending our every need. Of course the rooms are elegant and very comfortable, although we found the bathroom somewhat cramped but nicely redone. Breakfast at the rear garden is a fabulous way to start your day in this vibrant Catalonian city, then stroll to Paseo de Gracia for the finest shopping only a few blocks away. ",5,2013,05,04
29,Perfect Location,"This hotel was amazing. We stayed in a standard room on a high floor but it was larger than a lot of suites in other hotels. Fantastic touches like television on wall..in a mirror, hidden bar/refrigerator and luxurious decorations. The location was perfect, close to attractions, shopping, restaurants. The staff was so helpful. The weather didn't cooperate on one particular night so we ate dinner at The Caelis at the hotel. We are normally not fans of hotel restaurants for dinners but this proved us wrong. It was a 5 star restaurant for the food and service. Very leisurely romantic dinner. I would stay at this hotel again",5,2013,04,30
29,Only positives,Great hotel; Superb staff; Ideal location; Perfect room decoration; Super sized bath room; Excellent breakfast; Everything that a 5* hotel should have is available here. (As a side-track: food in restaurant Caelis is superb - maybe missing a little bit of cosiness),5,2013,04,28
29,"Stunning, romantic hotel.","Had the absolute pleasure of staying at El Palace for 5 nights.

Formally The Ritz the public rooms were simply stunning. Staff were amazing, so friendly, warm and attentive. They really made you feel like a VIP. 

Our suite was tastefully decorated with plush curtains and decadent furnishings. Loved the dressing room but the best part had to be the bathroom. The shower was big enough for 4 people. Full marble, jacuzzi bath and his & hers sinks. 

Even loved getting back at 2am on the last night and there was a power cut. We called the concierge who arranged for candles to be brought to our room and we danced til dawn. 

Utter and unadulterated luxury. 

It has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in.",5,2013,04,21

Strongly suggest people to stay here for who will go Barcelona, not only its perfect location ( you could walk to lots major shopping/sightseeing places ) but also friendly&helpful hotel staff and gorgeoue classic interior. All staff are trying hard to make your stay as comfort as possible. Enjoyed having buffet breakfast at The Garden and having drink at Bar Hall in the elegant atmosphere with not really expensive price. Room service is served quick and well.  Also room is always kept clean, and the bed is firm and comfortable for sleep.
It's a truly lovely 5 stars hotel!!! I would love to stay here again next time to Barcelona..",5,2013,04,18
29,"Lovely hotel, gorgeous rooms, attentive staff","I have stayed here 2 or 3 times while in Barcelona, it's a lovely place, absolutely gorgeous interior.

Roman Bath.
I had rooms with Roman bath and they were extremely comfortable for me, I've never had it in any other hotels. The bathroom also offers a separate hot tab and a shower room in addition to that Roman bathing pace.

Bed
Hands down the most comfortable bed I've ever had. They use some kind of coconut mattresses and even offer them for sale. I might buy it for home, hands down the best good night sleep so far.

Food.
The breakfat was nice, good selection of food. They can also cook whatever you prefer eggs or omelets.
There is a famous restaurant in the lobby but I have never gone there. I much prefered the cafe they have in the lobby, the food is extremely nice and the serving is very attentive. 

Service.
They really try the best to make your stay the best. The reseptionists, the concierge, the cleaning ladies, the waiters are very well trained and seem really care about your comfort :) There iis nothing they can't help you with in this hotel.
And believe me, I have experienced a bad service in 5 stars before, so I know what I'm talking about. One of the worst 5 stars hotels I've experienced in my life is also located in Barcelona - Casa Fuster. I should had filed police report on those criminals working for that place.

Location.
It's in a good location but not the best. Kind of boring. It's 2 blocks from the passege de gracia and it's kind of slow. I wish it was exactly on the pasege de gracia, in this case it would be the perfect hotel in Barcelona. 

Other than that I really enjoyed this hotel and would definately come back. It's a very good example of what 5 stars hotels should be.

Bravo, El Palace.",5,2013,04,15
29,"Excellent room, perfect location in Barcelona","In our recent trip to Spain my wife and I stayed in several different ""5 star"" hotels.  El Palace was by far our favorite.  We arrived at the hotel early and while we had to wait a little over an hour for the room to be ready, it was worth the wait.  We booked a standard room but received a premium upgrade without ever asking for it.  We ended up on the third floor with a view.  The room was enormous in comparison to the other hotels we stayed in.  The location is great.  We were steps from Passieg de Gracia and the metro there.  We walked down to the Gothic Quarter everyday.  La Rambla and the Boqueria de St.Josep is within a short walk as well.  Overall, we really enjoyed this hotel and would highly recommend it.",5,2013,04,13
29,Excellent Easter stay,"El Palace was a superb choice for our 4 night Easter break.
The hotel is truly beautiful and is excellently located.
The warm welcome from all of the staff was exceptional.  They could not have done more to make us feel at home.
We were upgraded upon arrival to a junior suite.  Actually, this turned out to be a mixed blessing.  All of the junior suites face the inner courtyard and the one we were given was on a lower floor.  As such, we found it rather dark.  It was a lovely suite but after one night we asked to move to a higher, outward facing room.  This is the only time in my life that I've ever asked to be 'down-graded' but we much preferred the light, airy and spacious room that we moved to.  The staff could not have been more gracious in dealing with this.
The concierge was excellent at all times.
Overall, the hotel was really lovely and the service was amongst the very best we have experienced.
I would certainly stay here again.",5,2013,04,12
29,"Fabulous room, great location","I stayed in this hotel for a long weekend.  The room was fantastic, great facilities, lots of space, very clean.  I found that staff very helpful.  I was a little put off by the dining facilities and common areas downstairs.  Iit was just a bit too posh for me to really feel comfortable and the prices for food or even a cup of coffee were high I thought.  Even in their cheaper cafe/restaurant, a cup of coffee was 7 euro.  The locaton of the hotel is excellent for sight seeing.  I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to visit.",4,2013,04,06
29,"Fabulous, perfect city hotel","My husband and I made a stop here for four nights on our honeymoon and we were really impressed by the quality of service as well as the room. We were upgraded without asking upon check-in, and we found all hotel staff without exception to be polite and helpful. The rooms appear to have been recently refurbished - I really liked the style! The bed was large and comfortable (although I have had better). 

The bathroom was really nice - a bath with a jacuzzi, and a rain shower head with temperature settings. 

The room / bathroom was well-maintained and cleaned regularly while we were out for the day. 

The hotel is really well located in my opinion, since it is away from the super-touristy area of La Ramblas and yet within walking distance of mostly anything you want to see in the city. I wouldn't want to stay any where else if I return to this city (as I hope to). 

We didn't eat at the hotel or use the spa, so I have nothing to add on that.",5,2013,04,03
29,A wonderful hotel in a wonderful city,"We stayed at the hotel for Easter with our two year old son.  The hotel is beautiful and extremely well maintained. However for a two year old it was a little formal.  There were lots of kids staying at the hotel and the staff were all extremely kind to our son however it was a little formal for a young child. At all times the three of us were made welcome in all parts of the hotel. .  

The breakfast room is particularly pleasant and the food excellent. They did have a baby chair, which is always helpful.  The concierge was able to offer several excellent restaurants for the three of us. 

We were disappointed the hotel wasn't more decorated for Easter and they didn't have any activities for children...not even a chocolate Easter egg. 

The rooms are well appointed with very modern bathrooms, unusually they had no face cloths!!  Also the first night they left the most amazing chocolate and on they second night they left a feel good message...we preferd the chocolate!!

The crib for our son was of a good quality and very clean. 

The hotel is in a good location, a few minutes away from the main tourist area but far enough away to feel you are not in the middle of an ongoing tour. 

We would return to this hotel. ",5,2013,04,01
29,"Nice, but disappointed room maintenance","Upon entering the room, I was soon greeted by a little spider from the chimney. Soon I saw hairpins on the floor, and some pieces of wood in the bathroom, which stayed there for the length of my stay. The shower looked like it has not been used often, and its floor white from calcium residue I guess. Very disappointing first impression for a hotel of this class and reputation. This was clearly not the attentive cleaning and maintenance you would expect. Also agree with the comments that the hotel leaves the impression of being empty, and somewhat tired in its decor, etc.

Otherwise, nice hotel, comfortable rooms and beds, all the amenities, etc. Good location, good service, and a very nice restaurant.",3,2013,04,01
29,Not Bad,"Hotel is very nicely restored.  Much attention to detail.  Location is not bad.   Some hotel staff had a bit of an attitude. I  have a suspicion this is a Catalan thing, because Spaniards in the rest of Spain do not have an attitude. The concierge during the day was somewhat standoffish - was really unhelpful when it came to some sites.  Like the Sagrada Familia - it was like a zoo there.  Thousands of people, with chaotic undertones.  Hey, get online tickets!!!!   We wanted to take some tours of the city - Concierge could not recommend one!   Then, the Caelis restuarant, with the fine dining.  Very rich and very expensive.  The head waiter was a little hostile and made me nervous with his militant approach and Elvis Costello punk-like suite. Rooms are very nice with TV in the mirror and great showers.  For world travelers, beware of Barcelona.  It is really overrun with tourists.  Plan ahead.  All the sites are packed.",3,2013,03,28
29,Excellent hotel,"We visited Barcelona to run in the 2013 city Marathon and were absolutely delighted with our choice of El Palace.  We are experienced worldwide travellers and agree that El Palace fully deserves its place in the 'Leading Hotels of the World'. The fabric and classic decor of the hotel is immediately welcoming and everything is exquisitely designed to give maximum comfort to guests. The most exceptional feature of our stay was, without doubt, the highest level of service in every department, from  the wonderful Concierges,  Manager, bar and restaurant staff  and porters. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all genuinely very pleased to give every assistance.  It was a memorable visit and we wholeheartedly and unreservedly  recommend this hotel.",5,2013,03,24
29,As if in fairyland,"Super hotel in the heart of Barcelona, one of the loveliest cities in the world. Everything that happened with us in this hotel made us smile. How we were received, the first impression that made us awake even late in the evening after a long flight. The breakfast amazed me mostly because of the atmosphere that terrace created! Light colors, gorgeous music, people not in a hurry, chatting with their families. Food is also excellent, but nothing extraordinary, by the way catering for everyone's  taste. I'm sure to come back there again and visit their spa and restaurant, cause we stayed too little to enjoy all the facilities.",5,2013,03,23
29,Pamper me more,"I loved staying at this place. I loved it soooo much. Yes they treated me like royalty and made me check twice if my blood had turned blue. The people that run this place are true professionals. Everything fit together perfectly. I have to admit that I'm a sucker for this opulent style, but the place was oozing comfort and luxury. Its distance from the Rambla is ideal. Too close to miss, too far to make shopping bags a drag. It kept me spending less! Thank you oh wise Hotel owner.",5,2013,03,22
29,Amazing place in Barcelona!,"This  was our second time in this wonderful city (last time we stayed by the Marina).
All installations are BREATHTAKING, especially the breakfast atrium: infinite choices, good service, luxury all around.
 Staff is good, very professional and classy, completely aware of the responsibility of working in a hotel with such history. 
On the last night we went downstairs to the Rien du Rien  club, small, comfortable and hidden, we had an amazing time... delicious cocktails and live music! An absolutely  fantastic way to end our visit. We will definitely come back!!!",5,2013,03,21
29,Luxurious....welcoming......amazing,"I booked this hotel to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. I did a lot of research into many hotels, but something always drew me back to El Palace, and I am so pleased I booked it.
After an excellent flight, we took a bus from the airport and seemed to be in the city centre in no time at all. We had looked at maps beforehand and had our walk planned to get to the hotel.
First impressions of the hotel was 'wow' and the welcome couldn't have been any more genuine. We were delighted to be told that we had been upgraded and when we were taken up to the room (526) we literally could not believe what a fantastic room we had been given. There was an entrance hallway with wardrobe and a small room with wc and sink in it, this followed on to a beautiful lounge, then on to the bedroom and through to the most amazing bathroom. On the lounge table was a bottle of cava on ice, water, chocolates and a lovely handwritten note from the management.
Every member of staff we came across had a smile and a hello and when I realised I had forgotten my travel adaptor concierge straight away just gave me one to borrow. On our last morning it was raining quite heavily so we were given umbrellas to use while we went out for breakfast.
On our last night we decided to have some drinks in the lounge, it was amazing just to relax in such beautiful surroundings whilst having a glass or two of cava.
We didn't eat in the hotel at all, all three mornings we walked down the side of the hotel and went to a cafe frequented by locals. We had the most amazing freshly squeezed orange juice and I loved the omelette sandwich they did. Two out of the three evenings we ate at Ciudad Condal and the food was amazing.
I can honestly say that this is THE best hotel we have ever stayed in, old world charm, character and elegance with all the mod cons to us is the perfect combination. It was definitely a treat for a special occasion, but so so worth it. Amazing.",5,2013,03,19
29,Grand and impressive - A marvellous hotel!,"Fairly good location and about a 15 min brisk walk to the main shopping area at the Rambla Catalunya. The hotel has a beautifully appointed lobby - grand yet comfortable! 
The rooms were tastefully furnished with the added delights of a pillow menu and an amazing bathroom with a rainwater shower.
A minor inconvenience was that there was no kettle in the room though room service did avail a pot of hot water when we asked for it. One suggestion we would like to make is that useful telephone numbers should be easily accessible on the phone itself.
All in all, an absolutely memorable stay and we would highly recommend El Palace.",5,2013,03,16
29,Excellent service in fine atmosphere,"We stayed a week in this good located hotel (two blocks from Placa de Catalunya). It was very easy to walk to Ramlas or Passeing de Gracia or even easier to take a taxi to Park Guell (there were always taxi's fours steps from the door). When it was raining (and it really did two days) it was nice to sit in a very large main hall and enjoy good service. And receptionist, I'm grateful for the tickets to Saturdays Barca game.",5,2013,03,13
29,Couldn't have asked for better! A long overdue review,"My husband I I stayed at El Palace for a post cruise 2 night stay.  The service, staff and room were all excellent!  We stayed in a Classic Deluxe.  The location of the hotel was also great.  

We had a problem with our booking and it was graciously resolved by Montse Pros.  Thank you so much!",5,2013,02,27
29,"Lovely Hotel - Great Location, Modern with old style charm","Second time at this hotel, the first was when it used to be The Ritz. It's lost none of its charm and quality. The hotel iyself has been upgraded in terns of the rooms but still retains a lo of old style charm. Set in the middle of Barcelona its a great base from which to explore this fabulous city.

Staaff were all helpful and friendly and the main bar set at the end of the fabulous lounge which retains the old 'Ritz' stye decor. The breakfacts catered for all needs, from cereals , fruit and various hot dishes. Free wi-fi available too.  Our deluxe room was well appointed and roomy, on the upper floor and pretty quiet. Bear in mind its the centre of one of the main roads in Barceloba so it can get noisy with window open. Only minor complaint is that on turndown service no water is provided so you have to pay or get it from the mini bar and at these rates I'd expect bottled water to be provided, hence the 4/5 rather than 5/5. Apart from that minor complaint , would definitely return to this hotel.",4,2013,02,25
29,"Grand hotel, great service, good location","We stayed in El Palace ( formerly Ritz) for three nights. The hotel is really ""Grand"", with doormen with top hats all the way to valet services. The rooms have been renovated recently and they are comfortable and quiet. As a nice detail - the TV is in the mirror!

Room service is quick and the cleaning department worked fine, yet invisibly, as regards making the beds ready in the evenings and getting slippers out to bedside.
Breakfast is really great and the ambience of the breakfast salon takes you to the 30´s. Staff is friendly too,from reception and concierge to breakfast attendants.
Do take a break in the hotel lobby - a sight in itself.
Location may be a bit ""off "" for some, but we found the location to be convenient for accessing Barcelona sights with the subway, and the Las Ramblas and old town are only 15 minutes walk away.
Recommended!",5,2013,02,25
29,PALACE THE MOST RITZ HOTEL EVER,"Even if they don't use the name, you will find a real grand hotel. We had an amazing experience  in Barcelona the location is excellent, the staff was great , warm, courteous.
I recomend this hotel as the best in Barcelona...if we are back to Barcelona we'll stay here.",5,2013,02,17
29,Highly recommended,"I stayed here in January 2013 for 6 nights with my 2 teenage children. We had a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived. We were shown to a large, beautifully decorated room even though we arrived at 7 am. The bathroom was the largest I have ever had in any hotel and modern. The staff were friendly, informative and gave us excellent restaurant/ tapas recommendations. Location is central and quiet. Overall a fantastic experience. ",5,2013,02,16
29,Compare with Hotel Arts Barcelona,"First of all Barcelona is amazing city that you miss it every time you leave it. It's my 2nd time in last 6 months that I travel to Barcelona and I love this city more than many famous city of EU.
Whether is fine even in January. 
El Palace is one of the best hotels I stay in. Imperial lobby that I never see before, even in compare to The Westin Palace Madrid. Rooms are good with new bathroom, service is good, kind and responsible staffs, easy access to heart of city by 2-5 minutes' walk and …..
But when compare with Hotel Arts Barcelona: I prefer to stay in Arts because except Lobby and easy access to downtime other parameter like sea view; easy access to beach, luxury rooms, excellent breakfast and ... was amazing in Arts. 
I recommend don't go to Barcelona without your sweethearts that for the first time be there with them cause you will miss them every second in every place in Barcelona.
Wish to be in Barcelona again and again very soon with my family.",5,2013,02,09
29,Excellent!!!!,Upon arrival after a long flight our is ready at 7am and the concierge and reception were very accomodating and courteous...i love EL Palace been to many hotels in Europe but I can say El Palace is the best so far...if i am back to Barcelona ill stay again here! Keep up the good work,5,2013,02,06
29,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location and Helpful Staff","Amazing hotel, nicely located and an easy walk to most attractions.  A hidden gem is the music lounge where not only are the acts amazing but the cocktails are too.  The concierge was amazingly helpful with maps and restaurant recommendations.  The rooms are beautiful, very well equipped and very comfortable.  We can not think of one thing missing from the hotel and would definitely return.  The one downside is the spa - it is not part of the hotel and we found it over-priced with mediocre therapists who were very pushy on the product selling.  However, this did not detract from our wonderful experience in Barcelona.",5,2013,01,28
29,A true 5 star hotel,"My son and I changed hotels to stay here. We didn't like the location of the other 5 star hotel. ( see separate review. ) The hotel is charming, elegant and extremely comfortable. It's very convenient   for the attractions of Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel, it's well worth having the wonderful breakfast. There are so many wonderful sights to see that we need to return and shall definitely stay at El Palace.",5,2013,01,27
29,"Palace by name, palace by nature","the el palace hotel really is a gem in the Barcelona crown. it is however let done by a average breakfast spread. the coffee brought to me was luke warm, and the pastries werent the freshest. we were also given a table right next to where the walkway was, despite there being lots of lovely tables in the corner of the room. the rooms were very luxurious in a classic elegant kind-of-way. great hotel, they just need to up the anti with breakfast",4,2013,01,19
29,"BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION, LOVELY STAFF","Our family of 6 (4 kids, 15 yrs and under) stated at this lovely gem of a hotel for 4 nights just after Christmas. We had a wonderful experience and the hotel is absolutely beautiful in an old-world-but-modern way. The staff was fantastic and warm and treated my children very well, genuinely happy to see them. The location is walkable to the major tourist sites and a short taxi ride/20 minute walk to the waterfront. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful and served in a charming terraced room. We did not eat in their upscale restaurant, but heard it was very good. 

Spa services were very nice.

The only downside was the lack of a pool.",5,2013,01,18
29,Luxurious,"This hotel is beautiful. The rooms have modern amenities but a classic look and feel. The staff were wonderful and accommodated our request for a high floor. Very luxurious place, the lobby is stunning and you really feel like you are in a palace. We liked the area, as it is close to many of the historic sites. In fact, you feel like you are staying in a historic site at this hotel. Also some excellent restaurants are nearby.

It is expensive, but we found that it was worth the price. We had room service breakfast on our last day there - not everything in the breakfast was great but we enjoyed most of it.",5,2013,01,18
29,"Amazing, best part of our trip to Barcelona","El Palace is a treasure.   It earns its title as part of the Luxury Collection with immaculate dining, lavish decor, impeccable service and perfect location.

There is nothing bad to say about our experience here, it was well worth the price tag.

Make sure to take advantage of the excellent breakfast that is available.",5,2013,01,01
29,Excellent Hotel,"A really first class experience; staff could not be more attentive and courteous.  Very large rooms, even by American standards - gorgeous bathrooms; incredible rain shower. Lighting on dimmer switches.  Real luxury in a grand old building.  Location is amazing since you are steps away from Exiample and Gaudi buildings, yet also steps away from Las Ramblas, Barrio Gotic and El Born.  You can truly walk to almost wherever you want to go.  Would absolutely stay here again without question.",5,2013,01,01
29,Mixed feelings,"The hotel is well maintained, old style, classic luxury. The room was fine. The bed is hard. Breakfast is not up to the standard at all. The bread and pastries were hard, I expected warm and fluffy. It takes 20 min to get one cooked egg. Basic breakfast stuff, certainly not worth the price... Go accross the street and have a nice experience at the bakery instead. Some staff are extremely polite, smiling and trying to do their job well, while others seem completely uninterested, almost rude...?! So, mixed emotions there.... Good shower/bathtub, location is ok. I guess it's ok, but next time in Barcelona we will choose something else. The only individual who really stands out with her attitude is Katharina, the guest relations person. Really positive, polite, welcoming, and seems to be a genuinely nice person.",4,2013,01,01
29,"Beautiful hotel, good location","I stayed here for a business trip in March 2011 for a week. Our meeting was also in the same hotel. The hotel has beautiful, regal decor... The rooms were big and comfortable, service was great even in the meeting rooms... And food/ breakfast was amazing!!!
It was walking distance to the shops and to everything we wanted to see.",5,2012,12,28
29,Great Stay and the Brandy Alexander's were really smooth,Stayed with wife and in-laws on back end of trip to Spain in August. Former Ritz recently updated. Close to all the Gaudi sites. Great service and the rooms with the Roman baths were nice. Staff very nice but on several occasions had to re ask for special services. Not a big deal but if they are trying to get back to that five star designation will need to pay attention to the details and follow-up. No complaints though and woulda stay there again on my next visit. Rates were reasonable for this type of venue.,4,2012,12,26
29,"Doing their best, and doing really good in this!","Great service, perfect location, very nice room, everything we liked very much! 

We had been walking into hotel Mandarin for a cup tee, and didn't feel so warm welcome as here.
Also when we're choosing the hotel, was looking into Bague hotel, happy that didn't choose it, because of this mess at the Rambla street, El palace is perfect location with two blocks from Passeige de Gracia, and when you come back to hotel, it is like coming back to the private house.

Special thanks to concierge (the one from France), did awesome job everywhere.",5,2012,12,23
29,"Opulence, and a feeling of home","This is a most luxurious hotel - beautiful in every respect. And the staff is extremely helpful and kind. It is well-located in the center of town, but the rooms were quiet - we never heard any street noise from them. We had the classic deluxe room - and it was really great. Loved the hotel!",5,2012,12,23
29,Beautiful hotel!,"We recently spent a week at this hotel.  At the time I placed our reservation, I selected the option to have a car service take us from the airport to the hotel.  The driver was waiting for us as soon as we cleared customs.  

Upon check in, we were assigned a room on the top floor with a king sized bed as we had requested.  The room and bathroom were large by European standards.  The bathroom was very nice with a separate tub and shower and double sinks.  I thought it was odd that they didn't have any wash cloths - just bath and hand towels.  Each day they had a turn down service and light cleaning including emptying the garbage cans.

The first morning, I woke up at 3:30 AM due to jet lag.  I realized that I had forgotten to bring the adapter for the camera battery charger.  My battery had gone completely dead during the flights to Barcelona somehow.  I called downstairs and asked if they had a U.S. to Spain elecric converter.  Not only did they have one we could borrow, but they brought it up immediately.  Any time we called for any kind of service such as ice delivery, they were very prompt and courteous.

I noticed that hardly any street noise could be heard in the room.  They also had very thick room darkening drapes on the window.  Both of these things helped us have very restful sleep while there.

We ate breakfast at the hotel every day.  The hot items were limited, but there were plenty of fruit and bread items available.  The continental breakfast is only 10 Euro less than the full breakfast.  The only negative was that they played Elton John's greatest hits three of the six times that we ate breakfast in the hotel.

The hotel was only about two blocks from a metro station, so getting around was very easy.  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful.  They arranged a car for us back to the airport and added it to our room.

If we go back to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2012,12,21
29,Excellent experience!,"Thank you El Palace for a wonderful function during the recent EIBTM event at your hotel, wonderful jazz experience and superb food and service. Really enjoyed the after drinks in the oppulent bar downstairs that just concluded a superb night!",5,2012,12,18
29,Feel the Ritz flair after renovation,"Warm and proffesional service. 
Very good alternative for those who want to experience 19s charming hotel but with a contemporary flair. Hotel was very well redone getting a nice balance between old and new times, you can still breath the building history.
Location is very convenient both for leisure and business purpose.",5,2012,12,18
29,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! A PALACE IN EVERY WAY!,"From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the hotel staff were wonderful.the room was perfect! the bathroom was really great! The food was the best! the location was most ideal.Everything was very close to the hotel.I can't wait to go back again.
THANK YOU TO ALL THE EL PALACE STAFF!!! You made our weekend a memorable one!!!!",5,2012,12,13
29,small rooms but nice staff,"we were upgraded to a junior suite which seemed like a regular room in most other hotels. The staff was marvelous and could not do enough for you, reccommendations, taxis, baggage, information, tours, etc.  We had a free continental breakfast which had, juice, coffee, rolls, which was fine. Tried the full breakfast one day and the scrambled eggs were the worst.  It was very cool in the breakfast room with all glass but they would put a heater over you. It must be great in the summer with the patio.",4,2012,12,11
29,Beautiful,"It's a lovely place, not on a great borough, but no badly located and close to the centre.Very well renovated, old time classic elegance of environment, fantastic (cocomat) mattresses and cosy rooms, excellent restaurant with fantastic desserts and a jazz bar which was so much fun with sort of another era air...The spa experience in this hotel is absolutely not to miss!",5,2012,12,11
29,Old world charm with modern facilities,"Walking into this hotel is like stepping back in time. It has grace, beauty & charm. The staff are welcoming and always helpful. Close to all Barcelona has to offer, you could not find better. Although there are no tea/ coffee facilities in the room (a bit of a downer) there is a quaint coffee shop/ patisserie across the street. Great rolls, pastries, cakes & coffee.",5,2012,12,07
29,2 night pre-cruise at El Palace,"Fabulous hotel, comfortable room, and excellent service.  We were fortunate to be upgraded to a junior suite.  Our package included a continental breakfast which was good.  Upgrade to the full buffet did not appear to be worth it.",5,2012,12,04
29,Quiet luxury defined!,"We were knock-out impressed by this hotel! Our room gorgeous, the location was perfect, and we felt like we had really lucked out, as we found this hotel by walking by it.

Some reviewers have commented that they did not feel treated as 'special' but for us, that was a bonus. Since the hotel staff are not my close friends, I just need to be regarded with respect and prefer restraint and helpfulness to pandering or over-eager reception. We felt charmed just being in this hotel and did not really notice that no-one followed us around to make sure we were comfortable. We were. 

At the point in our tour of Spain that we arrived at El Palace, both my husband and I had become sick - he with a flu and I with a cold. We were so taken with the comfort of the room that we were secretly ok with staying in. Our illnesses gave us an excuse to enjoy the comfortable bed, the fine linen and the tv-camoflaged-as-a-mirror. The main lobby lounge was so beautiful that I spent a couple hours reading there and taking tea, as my husband slept. 

We would venture out of the hotel, but when we tired (which happened quickly) we were thrilled to get back to this romantic boîte of a hotel. In fact, we still talk about this hotel as one of the nicest we have visited and dream of when we can splurge again.",5,2012,12,02
29,5 star all the way,"On the way to join our ship for a cruise round the Medi we decided to spend a couple of days in Barcelona.   As we live in Marbella we decided to take the Ave train from Malaga, travelling business class, which was well worth what we paid.  We also decided to stay at the El Palace Hotel (was the Ritz originally) and were not disappointed.  From arrival to leaving we were made to feel welcome and every member of staff we came into contact with made our stay one to remember.  The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and the room we had was out of this world and we were not disappointed with anything, from drinks on arrival late in the evening to breakfast in the lovely conservatory to dinner in the Michelin Star restaurant.  The staff were all very helpful, courteous and made our stay very relaxing.

The Michelin Star Restaurant within the hotel was absolutely the best we have ever visited, from the waiters, waitresses and especially the Front of House, we could not have been made more welcome, but when it came to the food it was exquisite!!!  We enjoyed every mouthful of the many course on the digestion menu, together with the individually paired wines for each course, which was absolutely an experience not to be missed.

To end this recommendation, I would also like to mention the taxi driver from the railway station to the hotel who had to find the hotel from limited information as I had miplaced the address, and who later returned to the hotel with two bags of expensive clothing I had left in the back of his taxi. 

All in all an experience not to be missed, so thank you everyone from the day trips round Barcelona, the absolutely wonderful hotel and restaurant and the very special taxi driver who went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed the rest of a fabulous stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,12,02
29,Something special,"The hotel has been kept incredibly well and looks stunning throughout. 

The service was very good in every area of the hotel, from the concierge to the waitress service in the Jazz bar. The reception staff were perhaps a little less than engaging on check in, but nothing worth talking about.

The room was nice with a little balcony and a view of the street below. Perhaps not quite as large as they look in photos but perfectly fine for 2. 

The breakfast was nice with plenty of choice, but in all honesty 32 Euros each is a little steep!  No brown bread available though and no wish to obtain any, despite a nice bakery being directly across from the hotel, a small thing but 5* Hotels are surely about the small things?

This theme is kept though out the rest of the hotel with drinks very highly priced, with a bottle of beer costing 8 Euros and a cup of Tea at 7 Euros! Incredible really, despite the high class of the hotel. 

Great location 2 blocks from Placa de Catalunya, but not too busy/ noisy, couldnt have chosen better in this regard.

Overall the Palace is very nice and a great experience, but worth the money? Possibly as a one off experience, but probably not as a return booking.",5,2012,12,01
29,Out of this world Palace,"After many stays in Barcelona we have finally found ""The one"" that we will most certainly return to a.s.a.p.
We have usually choosen on or near the Ramblas and I was afraid when reserving that El Palace was a little too far from the central shopping area but no its very central -really a short walk away and worth the visit.
We got a good deal on one of the trip advisor sites ""logitravel"",junior suite WITH breakfast included.We payed 80 euros less than price quoated on all other sites, officiel site included.
The lounge and breakfast rooms are very impressive,had tea in the lounge area and didn't really want to leave.
2 glasses of cava(spanish version of champagne) offered at bar and complimentory chocolates on arrival in our junior suite. Room spacious, cosy and silent.Huge bathroom.
Parking 30 euros.
Cocktail bar worth a visit for night music but pricey,whisky 20 euros.Cocktails less expensive.
Just loved ths Hotel and can't wait to go back.",5,2012,12,01
29,very good....,"Has everything what you can expect from 5 star.
Comfortable bed, lovely lobby, great location and friendly staff.
Can't feel treated as someone special unfortunately.
Staff doesn't use guest name during stay.
Didn't feel Catalunyan or Barcelona spirit in the hotel.
Russian magazine in the bedroom wasn't a pleasant thing to see.
Dinner ok. Pricing not too bad.",4,2012,11,26
29,Perfect palace,"This beautiful hotel was formerly called the Ritz and is incredibly elegant with beautiful detailing everywhere you look from the elegant dinning room to the beautiful garden room with a wonderful atrium.
The room we had was really fantastic. Full of old world charm and sophistication.
The hotel is in a very good location close to tappas bars and shopping.
The staff was very good and if you enjoy being spoilt then thepalace is for you.
I would highly recommend staying at the Palace.",5,2012,11,26
29,A treat,"We stayed for 4 nights and it is worth the money. A beautiful building with elegantly restored furnishings as well as modern touches.

I would live at this place full time if I could.

Bar was a little pricey but otherwise well worth it",4,2012,11,25
29,Pricey but nice,We had a room for 3 (I guess considered a suite) and the bathrooms were great.  Great shower and spacious.  The room was good-nothing spectacular for the price though.  The staff was helpful and courteous but the hotel had a stuffy feel--just a throw back in time and very formal.,4,2012,11,18
29,The best hotel I've visited so far,"I ve picked the hotel for high tripadvisor ranting and reasonable price for 5 star facility. Loved it completely. Service by every staff member is extraordinary. You actually get more care than you expect. Rooms are spacious and nicely furnished, bathroom is big and has both a bath and a shower. Bathroom supplies are by my favorite l'occitan. Breakfast is variable and delicious ( nice selection of juices and champagne).Hotel has 1 Michelin star restaurant we had no chance to visit, but this is something I will do during next trip to Barcelona. Key places of interest and shopping area are walking distance. Hotel is 100% recommendable and I will definitely come back. Great value for money.",5,2012,11,12
29,Stay in El Palace Hotel,"Very good members of  staffs. Room service was good. but there was no Tea or coffee in the room so I had to buy my own tea and milk but room service provided us with a kettle and cups.
front desk staffs were very good and help full. The location is not too close to central but walking distance to ramble. we were able to walk to most of the restaurants and other places.
we had a very nice time in Barcelona.",4,2012,11,12
29,Elegant and sophisticated,"Barcelona is full of new world hotels, but El Palace is old world - wonderful and sophisticated as well as nicely located.  The rooms are very comfortable and very nicely appointed with exemplary amenities.  

The biggest negative - we did not care for the fine dining restaurant - elegant, but a bit stuffy and we felt the food neither measured up nor represented Barcelona - a little too nouvelle / too much French influence.  The biggest positive - special thanks to Katarina of the concierge staff who is charming, and went way out of her way to give us individual attention in providing guidance and assistance - simply great.",5,2012,11,09
29,Gorgeous hotel with old-world charm,"We stayed for four nights in October 2012 , arrived early after a flight from NY, and were immediately shown our room.   What a nice bonus! The buffet breakfast, served in a beautiful atrium ,  was varied and delicious.  Convenient location, with friendly English speaking staff. Loved  the hotel lounge, and the jazz bar downstairs.   They were switching internet providers during our stay so guests had complimentary access for a few days. Room was comfortable. Concierge had good restaurant suggestions.  Would definitely return.",5,2012,11,07
29,Oasis in the middle of the action,"This hotel has a great old world ambience about it from the minute you check in. We stayed in a suite and found the accomodation clean, modern and roomy. The location of the hotel is central without being too close to La Rambla. We were able to walk to most restrauants and bars that we visited. I can't speak too highly about the service and recommendations provided by all the concierges who attended to us. They really made exploring and enjoying the city a breeze. Although the hotel does'nt have a pool the beautiful breakfast atrium makes up for it, a great way to start the day.",5,2012,11,05
29,"Nice location, fine hotel - bad reservations","This hotel has a very nice location close to the fine shopping in a nice neighbourhood. I had bad experience on the booking. I emailed the hotel through a webform on their homepage and did not get a response the next day so in the afternoon I had to call them for the quote. I asked for other services and I also had to follow up on these over the following days.

But the hotel was fine. Slow elevators, but the exercise was good for me. We were upgraded free, a nice gesture and got a nice room. We had to move the following day as our bathroom leaked to the floor below.

The restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the city with a Guide Michelin star and was a great experience. The breakfast is also very, very good but also very expensive.",3,2012,11,05
29,Unbelievable Experience ..,"This is more than my expectation, i didn't think for a while that the hotel will go beyond my thoughts. it is a dream for people looking for royalty.
in the middle of every thing. I think i wont change the hotel if i will visit Barcelona again in the future.",5,2012,11,04
29,A Great Place to Stay in Barcelona,"Had the pleasure of staying at El Palace Hotel during a recent stay in Barcelona. The rooms were recently rennovated and very spacious.  The bathroom was very large as well.  After a long day of walking all over the city, it was nice to come back to a whirlpool bathtub.  The staff was amazing and was very helpful in helping us with directions and suggestions. They really made us feel welcome and like special guests.  With the locaiton being between the two major areas of the city, it was easy to walk all over the city.  On the last morning, we ordered roomservice and everything from the eggs to the smoked salmon was delicous.  There was a large table of flowers in the entry as you walked into the hotel. A very inviting welcome.",5,2012,11,03
29,Home away from home,"We just returned from our 2 weeks Opera Vacation in Europe and during this time we visited the wonderful and cosmopolitan city of Barcelona; in  this trip we choose to stay in the beautiful Palace Hotel.
 
Due to our fly schedule we arrived very early, however the guys at the front desk were good enough for checking us in, and the concierge was wonderful for holding our bags while we went for stroll on the ''via de gracia' and dId some shopping,  Then we waited in the lobby until our room was ready; even knowing that we were early the staff was apologizing for the room not being ready. When it was ready they took us to our room, with more apologies for the time we waited.
 
Back at home we live in a club called ""Palace Place"" and went to Barcelona to the Palace Hotel, and in both we fell the same. Thanks for the employees and services of this hotel that made us as fell right at home. 
 
The hotel is gorgeous, the room was excellent and the location is good.  

The services are excellent from the door man to concierges to check in officers to the room services, all are very  professionals in  whatever  they do.
 
Thanks to all",5,2012,11,02
29,Old Ritz... New El Palace...,On the Gran Via...great place to be in midst of the busy street.. royal old touch to all rooms.. lucky was in one of the suites...enjoyed the bath..and the spa experience...the breakfast is awesome but not with alot of variety but with basics plus some touch of English dishes...the outside area is the best to be...an underground pub to say very elegent...  over all a good stay..the hotel is 15 mins drive to the marina...20mins from the airport..5mins walk to the La Ramblas...,4,2012,10,31
29,Fantastic room,"My husband and I thought this hotel had the best room of our trip around Europe this Summer, hands down.  The customer service was exceptional too.  Also, the hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring this wonderful city.  We will return.",5,2012,10,30
29,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff,"We were first struck by the beauty of the hotel on the outside when we drove up in the taxi.  Then we were met by the most friendly and helpful doorman who went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that our room was perfect (which it was!  We were upgraded to a 2 room suite which was very nice).  The bathroom was lovely and very nicely appointed with a spa tub and spacious double marble sink.

The hotel is in a perfect location, close to the best shopping and Las Ramblas.  It is close to restaurants, all very walkable.  I felt very safe.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a lovely Old World hotel in Barcelona.",5,2012,10,29
29,Barcelona heaven,"El Palace is a beautiful, recently redone, old world hotel in a great location. The staff were phenomenal, room was exquisite with perhaps the best shower i have ever had in my life. The lounge is spectacular, and the bar in the basement should not be missed. I cant wait to get back there!!",5,2012,10,29
29,Grand old hotel,"This hotel was perfectly located, close to many attractions.  The staff were polite and helpful and the hotel was ornately decorated and very attractive.  Our room was comfortable, with lovely toiletries in the bathroom. The breakfast buffet had a wide selection to choose from.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good hotel in Barcelona.",5,2012,10,28
29,Restaurant Review of Palace Hotel Restaurant,"We were looking for a place to have dinner at our normal six pm dinner time, or there abouts.
That is a challenge in Barcelona.  We happened upon the Palace Hotel, which was close to the Silken Gran Havana Hotel where we stayed.
We went for dinner the first night we were there and it was simply DELICIOUS.  Atmosphere was elegant and relaxing, service superb, and overall a great dining experience.
When we were leaving, we noticed it was a Ritz Carlton property.
It was so lovely, we returned the next evening for dinner again.
Important info for anyone who wishes to eat around 6 pm.",5,2012,10,26
29,"Wow, pure luxury","Just got back today after a couple of nights staying in this hotel and what can I say. Great location, staff very helpful and room was lovely and we got upgraded to a suite on arrival. I would like to thank everyone for a great stay.",5,2012,10,21
29,Great choice for a Barcelona Visit,"We were very happy with our choice of hotel for our recent visit. We arrived in the middle of the afternoon and while we had to wait  little bit for our room to be ready, the hotel more than made up for it by upgrading us to an amazing junior sweet. The bathroom was fabulous, the rooms very clean and the whole feeling quite opulent. My only criticism is that the wi-fi is very expensive in the room and difficult to access in the lobby. A hotel that is otherwise of this quality and expense should provide free wi-fi to its guests. The location was also very convenient for both the Eixample and the ares along Les Rambles and the Gothic Quarter.",4,2012,10,21
29,Perfect luxury,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff, the room was spacious and very relaxing, the food was excellent and very reasonable for a hotel of this quality. Great location within easy walking distance of shops and sights.",5,2012,10,18
29,Very nice hotel not far from central Barca,"Great hotel not far from all the sights. A little bit old fashioned, but still worth a visit. Staff very helpful right from the start. Rooms were in good condition, good shower, good king size bed. My only complaint would be the bar prices. I know it's a 5 star hotel, but there's no need to charge 7 euro for a bottle of beer or 11 euro for a glass of wine. Add 16 euro for a rum and coke or gin and tonic and your bar bill can quickly add up!

Fun bar downstairs with resident band that were very good. 
All in all a good hotel",4,2012,10,17
29,Great hotel in a great city,"ALthough this was a splurge for us, it was well worth it.  We LOVED the Palace not only for the location, accommodations but the concierge services were incredibly good.  They were helpful with directions, restaurant suggestions, online ticket ordering etc.  
The rooms were quite atypically large for Europe and the glass doors that opened to the busy street blocked out the noise entirely.  So we had the luxury of a great exciting view as well as quiet to sleep by. Nice little workout room too.
We would definately stay there again.  One happy couple from Tennessee.",5,2012,10,17
29,Graet Hotel & Staff,We stayed her for 3 nights in September and found the hotel and its restoration to the glory days when it was a Ritz Hotel to be stunning. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the breakfast room and food were exceptional. It would be my recommendation for anyone coming to Barcelona.,5,2012,10,15
29,Wifi shocking,Comfortable and pleasant place but wifi is a shocker - only reception in the bathroom - it's outsourced to some third party vendor and the complimentary version is slower than dial up - the premium version is not much faster. Hopeless and unusable. You'd expect better from a Leading Hotel of the World. Reception was powerless to do anything as no on site expertise.,3,2012,10,12
29,Perfect Sanctuary in Busy Barcelona,"We stayed at the El Palace for 5 nights while in Barcelona.  Its a stunning hotel with large rooms and added a touch of glamour to our holiday.  Its just the right distance away from Las Ramblas as to not be bothered by hordes of tourists and the touts that follow them.  The lounge area is decadently furnished and the staff were friendly and courteous.  At times, some of the reception staff were a little serious however they were still courteous during all interactions.  The standout for us was Celine the Guest Services Manager.  Celines showed us to our room on day one, was elegant and welcoming and is to date the finest greeting to a hotel room we have ever experienced.  We will stay here again.",4,2012,10,10
29,Wonderful hotel,"Inspite af a very few poor reviews amongst the glowing ones we decided to stay at the El Palace.  I can only assume that those who didn't like the palace were there during the recent renovations.  The hotel is beautifully updated, quiet, luxurious, and conveniently located in an excellent part of the city.  

The staff couldn't have been nicer. I had made our reservation a couple of months before our arrival and on the day before we arrived I emailed the hotel to advise them of our morning arrival and to ask if there was any possibility of an early check in.  Upon arrival at 10:00 a.m. We were greeted warmly and immediately shown to our upgraded room.

Our next pleasant surprise was the food in the hotel.  Both my wife and I had come down with colds so after our days of sightseeing we couldn't face going out of the hotel to try restaurants for a late dinner.  We ate in the hotel each night and had their splendid breakfast on our last day.  We are well traveled and eat out often so we are particular about the food in restaurants.  I could not find even the smallest fault.

We will definitely return to El Palace Barcelona",5,2012,10,07
29,"Outstanding hotel, absolutely stunning","My husband and I spent 4 nights in this beautiful hotel. Never having been to Barcelona we weren't sure where to stay and to what proximity to attractions any hotel would be. We randomly chose El Palace and it was the best decision we could have made. It was once a Ritz hotel so the attention to detail does not go unnoticed. It is definitely a luxury hotel with all the amenities. Our room was huge with a beautiful sitting room, large bedroom, large walk-in closet and a large bathroom with separate shower an toilet area. There is a bar and restaurant on the main floor where we did eat lunch. The food was good but the service is very slow. We had drinks every evening before dinner in their front hall and the service was extremely slow where at times we had to chase down the server. It wasn't for lack of them, they just never approached us for an order once we sat down. The free wi-fi is only for the main floor and the service is only for an hour, which is very frustrating. The concierge service was awesome, very friendly and accommodating. Location was excellent, walking distance to anywhere you want to go. Passeig de Gràcia and La Rambla are only a 10 minute walk. We love to walk so even to walk from the hotel to the waterfront was approximately 30-40 minutes. Would definitely recommend this hotel even with the few complaints. It is truly a 5* hotel.",4,2012,10,06
29,"Wonderful hotel, great location!","We had the pleasure of staying at this lovely hotel for two nights post cruise.  Beautiful elegant hotel, terrific location close to shopping and more, and extremely helpful and courteous staff.  Highly recommend!",5,2012,10,05
29,THE Place to Stay,"El Palace – we typically do a lot of productive research before visiting a city for the first time but still made a number of mistakes on our most recent trip including tours and restaurants. Fortunately we ended up at a wonderful hotel.... many of the positives of our experience not a result of research.

El Palace (formerly the Ritz) is grand, palacial yet not too big. The common areas reminded us of the Fairmont San Francisco as did many of the other wonderful features of the hotel. We arrived at 8am on a red-eye from Toronto and expected to just leave our bags at the hotel and if lucky get an early noon check-in. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite and were checked in immediately. This allowed us to get 3-4 hours sleep then hit the city rejuvenated. The only interruption to our much needed sleep was room service with a complimentary bottle of cava and chocolates.

After 4 days in Barcelona, we realized the hotel was in a great location.... 5-6 blocks from Las Ramblas and a couple blocks from Passeig de Gracia. Many of the top-brand hotels are located near the Vila Olimpica which like the Olympics, is tacky and manufactured. During the summer, the beach area may have a great vibe and hot bods but believe me it is cold and dead the rest of the time. Furthermore, it is away from the action and the nearest Metro stop is a hike. It does have a lot of Burger Kings however..... one of the legacies of the Olympics.

The hotel has an incredible breakfast buffet at the rear of the hotel. The room is bright and spa-like and the selection of fruit, cheeses, meats, juices, breads, pastries, and eggs is fabulous. 28E per person is a little over the top but I'd highly recommend doing it at least once. By comparison, cafe con leche, fresh orange juice and a croissant at Ciudad Comdal (NE corner of Gran Via Corts Catalanes and Passeig de Gracia) is 9E for two.

The hotel also has a great jazz/blues bar in a cool room in the basement at the bottom of a sprial staircase. We closed the bar one night and really enjoyed the El Palace gin & tonics and some great music (music off at 1am, bar closed at 2am on a Wednesday night).

Staff at El Palace are top notch.... ready to help in any way they can.... in any language.... Catalan, Spanish, French, English, etc.

The only negative in our stay was the absense of free WIFI in the rooms. We signed up for the WIFI service at 15E per day and then found it difficult to log off and switch between multiple devices.... the WIFI only allowed one user. Given that we didn't go to Barcelona to surf the net, this was both the only and a very small negative.

We will certainly stay at El Palace on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2012,10,02
29,Barcelona,"Awesome city, hotel and staff, that sums it up.
Location: perfect
Staff: Bell captain, bellman, concierge - all top notch and very helpful
Hotel: Clean, quiet and nicely appointed

Definitely consider this hotel in your search.  The hotel actually looks like the photos on their website, you won't be dissapointed if you like 1919 architecture.",5,2012,10,02
29,"Beautifully renovated, great service","I stayed with my husband and 2 kids (ages 9 and 11) for 3 nights beginning of august.
The hotel is old fashion style, beautifully renovated. The bedrooms are large, the bathrooms too. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the winter garden. The food selection and freshness was wonderful, the decor very 19th century. The kids loved it too.
You can walk to many places from the hotel (Gaudi buildings are very close and the old town a little further)",5,2012,09,26
29,Beautiful Hotel With Top Notch Service!,"This hotel was formerly the Ritz. We arrived early after disemabarking an Azamara cruise.  Our room was not yet ready but were made comfortable in the old world style and very impressive lobby. Hotel is absolutely beautiful.  Room was very large and beautifully decorated.  Large modern bathroom and plenty closet space. We had a corner room with a balcony which overlooked the city.
Service was excellent from doorman to concierge.  They were always very helpful with suggestions and directions. We were here only 2 nights.  Did not eat at the hotel restaurants.  Had breakfast right across the street at a small cafe....great coffee and buns!

Location was great. A few blocks walk to Las Ramblas area with plenty of restaurants and shopping. Short driving distance to ""old town"", museums and other attractions or about a 40 minute walk.  

Barcelona is a beautiful city and would definitely return again and stay at the El Palace.",5,2012,09,20
29,Good Hotel in a Great City,"The location is just right between the ""old town"" and their museums and the Gaudi buildings and attractions around the city.
My rate included continental breakfast and the difference between that and the 39Euro breakfast was ""cold-cuts"" on the buffet.
Upon arrival at the airport the driver was not familiar with the hotel and the address that I had did not have a street number.  He went to the area and asked a hotel doorman for advice and found out it was the Ritz.  When I looked up the location on Google Earth it showed a hotel in the middle of a block and not the correct hotel.  My guess is that this is a new name on an old facility that recently underwent a major renovation.
That said the facility was up to date and clean.  On my floor but not in my room there was a faint smell of ""fish"".  The separation of tasks for each employee was very obvious such as the concierge would not have the internet code but the front desk does.
The room was large enough for 2, but not a suite.  The bathroom was laid out nicely with dual sinks a tub and a separate shower.  The room also had an entrance lobby about 8 feet long that helps keep the room quite.  Like in a lot of hotels now, you have a choice of pillows and soaps.
The restaurant was rated one star but I did not find the food up to standard for a one star.  Also my American tastes prevented my from ordering many of the items on the menu.
I found Barcelona the be one of the most buitiful cities that I have ever seen.  One building was nicer than the next!
Spend some time drinking a Cava on a couch in their bar area.",4,2012,09,17
29,Quality every step of the way!,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the El Palace Hotel in October 2011 and it is by far our favourite hotel of all time.
From the moment you lay eyes on the hotel - you will fall in love! The rooms are so tastefully decorated with some very innovative designs. Mirrors that are televisions, minibars behind picture frames...it truly is a complete experience.
The location is second to none. It is within easy walking distance to La Rambla but is so quiet and peaceful of a night time. The staff are very friendly and attentive and nothing is too much trouble for them. If you are looking for a perfect Barcelona hotel - then you can not go past the El Palace!",5,2012,09,14
29,The realy great hotel,"We stayed at El Palace for three days in September. Thou we arrived in the hotel very eiarly, we can get the room right away. And we can stay  two hours later the chek-out time.
This hotel is a realy Ritz! It has the same ambiance and interior. My friends were impressed and grateful, that i had chosen this hotel to stay. Besides there was my husband's birthday during the stay, so he got a nice present from the hotel.",5,2012,09,14
29,Pricey but worth it.,Spent two nights at this hotel in August. Our overnight flight from the west coast had us at the hotel at 8 AM yet our room was available and waiting. Top floor room with a great balcony and view. The hotel location is a short walk to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla but was quiet at night.The room was very well appointed and spotlessly clean. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The hotel public areas are the epitome of European luxury. The breakfast buffet is as good as you can find anywhere and served in beautiful surroundings. You can find comfortable hotels for less money but if you want something special and are prepared to pay a little extra for it this hotel can't be beat.,5,2012,09,11
29,State of the art hotel,"I stayed twice at El Palace in Barcelona,during August & September2012,( Ritz)  each room  has a chimney place, very comfortable with pillows menu.  I wished for fluffy duvets but they had only sheets & bedcovers .It's a  glamorous city hotel with Opulent classical setting & attention to detail in each corner yet maintaing a cosy & relaxing atmosphere with no pretention and  a great friendly staff.  On my first stay we had a welcome fruit basket and  water, on the second nothing! Breakfast is set in an  indoor and outdoors areas, very elegant and refreshing start of the day. Staff is attentive and our concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful. Location is perfect, you can literally walk to see all major sites of Barcelona and shopping areas.",4,2012,09,07
29,Great hotel in perfect location,"This place really feels like a palace! I think this used to be the Ritz, and it definitely oozes old school glamor. Very opulent and classic, but with all the modern amenities. If you want a contemporary feel, this is probably not the hotel for you, but it surely is one of the best in Barcelona.

We stayed in a Classic Deluxe (their smallest room), which was actually quite spacious considering, including a large closet. The bathroom was a bit tight, but had both a nice rain shower and tub. Our windows faced the main street, but we could not hear anything thanks to the well insulated glass. 

The location of El Palace could not be better. Walking distance to many Barcelona's central sites and great restaurants, as well as near numerous metro lines.  The only strange thing, which other reviewers have pointed out as well, is the internet. No WiFi in the rooms, but what is even stranger is that you need a code to use both your own computer in the lobby or one of the business center computers. Plus, the code expires within a short time frame, so you have to go back and get a new one each time. Bizarre.",4,2012,09,03
29,Top hotel in Barcelona,"Overall a beautiful hotel in a great location - easy to get everywhere.  The room was very large and comfortable.  Nice bed, bathroom, amenities and very peaceful.  The lobby was very old world and comfortable - I spent time there daily as that is where the only free wifi was located.  That would be my only criticism as wifi today should be free.  Finally the staff and concierge desk especially were very friendly and helpful whether it was dinner reservations, suggestions or arranging transportation to the airport.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona.",5,2012,08,28
29,Truly excellent,"It a pleasure to enjoy such a professional hotel . Charming old world building with the highest of standards . Helpful , attentive staff at all levels made our stay very comfortable and enjoyable . Would thoroughly recommend a stay here.",5,2012,08,28
29,"If you can stay at the Palace, do your self a favour, you will not be disapointed.","What can I say about this hotel, well quite a bit but I will stick to the important facts. My wife and I and our 11 year old son stayed at the Palace in August 2012. Everything was top notch. The junior suite room was amazing, the food amazing and the hotal staff amazing. The staff recomended very nice places to eat and were very helpfull in arranging trips, taxis and so on. Like I said it's not cheap but I feel you really get what you pay for. The hotel is well located and you can walk to many attractions.",5,2012,08,27
29,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This was a lovely old world hotel with a friendly, helpful staff.  The bedroom was lovely, the breakfasts were wonderful.  My only criticism is  that the livingroom and dining area leading to the breakfast room had a strong, sickining sweet smell.  I would never have even considered having dinner or a drink in these common areas.  I assume the smell was from their cleaning supplies-but it was overwhelming.  Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel very much.",5,2012,08,27
29,Elegant and Location,"We requested 2 deluxe rooms with fireplaces, Roman Baths, balcony, on an upper floor close together and were granted said rooms.  The decoration, service, breakfasts in the garden room were enjoyed everyday.  We hung out in the lobby as much as feasible in this town with so many sites to explore.  We always looked forwarded to ending up in the bar at the end of the lobby and or the bar downstairs.  We always tried to enjoy a snack in the bar at the end of the lobby so that we could admire the lobby.  It was the old world feel that we liked and yes we felt like we lived in a Palace.  All the fabrics were beautiful and elegant and yet we were allowed to sit on them and enjoy them.  Loved the Decoration.",5,2012,08,24
29,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at this hotel 3 nights during a business trip in Barcelona.
Really loved the property and the accomiodation. Service was excellent and room was clean.
Breakfast was excellent. Loved the concierge.
I have been sick the last day of my stay and staff was freindly and very helpfull, changing towels more than twice (usual) and really interested in my health.
Good location. I would recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to Barcelona",5,2012,08,24
29,Another great experience at The Palace!,"The second time we stayed at The Palace, Barcelona was for 5 days and we still intend to return when we visit the city again!  It has the ambience and luxury of a classical 5 star hotel without any snobbery which can often be the case, we love it.  We had breakfast a couple of days and whilst it seems expensive it is very good quality and don't forget it's a buffet! - I had perfect Eggs Benedict made to order twice.  My wife tried the spa and whilst pricey she did say it was good treatment and worth the experience.",5,2012,08,23
29,Pure perfection,"Stayed at the El Palace for 4 nights in August 2012 with my wife. Barcelona was a part of our honeymoon.
Booked the El Palace at a very good price. Breakfast was not included so i cannot review it.

But overall the hotel is pure perfection. The location, the service, the concierge, the cleanliness, the food.. Everything is just great.

The rooms are huge. And i mean HUGE. They get cleaned twice a day, and towels are also changed every afternoon if they have been used.
The only negative for the rooms is the lack of free wifi, or even cheap wifi internet.
There is free wired access for laptops though.

The service overall is just great. The concierge desk is always there to help you for everything you ask for. The hotels' hall and bar/restaurant offer great drinks, food etc all day long and in good prices for a 5* GL hotel.

The location is also great. The hotel is located 5 minutes walking time from Placa Catalunia and Ramblas. Great safe street and taxi at your service 24hours a day.
We chose not to stay on the Ramblas and we did not regret it.

I would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona for the first time or even returning to the city. The price could be a bit high but you can get good offers from time to time so keep an eye on it.",5,2012,08,18
29,Location and class,"I am very glad to have a good review of the El Palacio Hotel, in Barcelona ,668 Gran Via de Las Corts Catalones, (i put in address because there are a few hotels with same name).
I had actually put off a trip to Barcelona because I had such a hard time finding a Hotel that was affordable and had a little class in a good location. I read trip adviser every time before I book a hotel and the reviews seemed pretty good for this hotel.
I found my experience with this hotel to be a very good one. I got a room that was spacious and
affordable compared to the going rate of hotels in europe.
The hotel has a gorgeous lobby, very nice breakfast area, and old style regal rooms. I saw so many hotels that were just too ultra modern when I was searching for place in Barcelona.
The hotel is very centrally located. Just a few minutes to walk to Las Romblas, you can also walk to La Sagrada Familia. 
I found the Employees to be efficient, and service good. I don't know why but it seems i always make friends with a nice bellman. Gleb (sp)was very helpful. 
I wish so many hotels did not charge for wifi, but I was able to connect to Internet in the room.
I found Barcelona to be a beautiful city with great architecture and friendly people. Didn't have any threat of thieves at all. ANd I could not believe all teh great deals being offered in stores.
There were 75% off sales everywhere.
One thing, the beds are very hard..i was ok with that but if you don't like hard beds you might consider that.
So i say Yes to El Palacio, I stayed before a cruise and after and it worked out to be a very good experience.",5,2012,08,16
29,A breathtaking way to end our honeymoon!,"Oh my, the El Palace is simply breathtaking! We arrived after disembarking from our cruise ship at 7.30am. From the moment we arrived we knew this was going to be a wonderful experience. The taxi doors were opened for us and the cases taken into the reception. Our room, even though very early, was ready! And we were upgraded to a room with a roman bath! R207.... my oh my....It was exquisite! The whole hotel is a mix of parisian opulence meets Agatha Christie. It's swags are huge but belong there, the glass mirrors everywhere reflect the lamps and textures of the sumptuous rooms, the restaurant is where you would expect Poirot to be eating his breakfast while solving a murder!! Oh and before I forget this Hotel smells utterly scrumptious! You have to have stayed there to understand this.... It's invigorating and mind teasing! I could go an and on about this hotel and I assure you all, you will not be disappointed staying here for any occasion. The staff are very friendly, polite, and obliging. The rooms are dapper and we will definitely be booking the Salvador Dali suite next time! Yes we will be returning! Our room really was fantastic, everything had been thought about. You need to see the marble fireplace and the hidden tv!  The bed was HUGE and the la Ocitaine bath products were such a treat. A perfect place for a honeymoon... Not to mention the complementary bottle of fizz and chocolates! Thank you El Palace! 
Everyone must stay at this hotel once in their lifetime... Barcelona is an amazing city and the   hotel is fantastically positioned. Go down to the cocktail bar and have a peek in the ONLY  smoking room in Barcelona. The decor down there will blow you away. 
In a nut shell, stay here! It's amazing!! I just wish I'd seen Piorot! ;-) 
See you all very soon!",5,2012,08,16
29,Pre Cruise Hotel....FABULOUS choice!!!!,"One of the best parts of our cruise was our pre hotel stay at the El Palace Hotel!!!!!! We cannot compliment this hotel enough. Every detail was taken care of. The interior is BEAUTIFUL. The service is one of the best we have experienced. The room was immaculate. The scent through out the hotel is wonderful. Room service was excellent. The dining room food was very good. My mother, my teenage daughter and I stayed here for two nights before our cruise out of Barcelona. A girls trip. The location is perfect. We were able to walk to several locations and felt very safe. Just having coffee or tea in the lobby is an event. It's a high class hotel, but not stuffy. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. It's expensive but so worth the splurge.",5,2012,08,10
29,Fantastic Old World Experience,"This beautiful hotel which used to be the Ritz has kept all splendor of yesteryear.  

The staff was so lovely, my husband and I arrived very early in the morning after an exhausting long light from Australia and the staff went out of their way to get a room ready for us early.  The breakfast buffet was awesome and the rooms extremely comfortable.

With lovely staff and it's close proximity to all the great Gaudi sites of Barcelona, the is a great hotel to book.",5,2012,08,05
29,A real palace,It is a very elegant and stylish historic building well kept and maintained with nice personel and five star amenities hotel.It is suitable for people who like luxuriousness and history as well.It is in the most central area of Barcelona in a walking distance from every big attraction of the city.,5,2012,07,31
29,"Luxurious, with very efficient service and friendly atmosphere","This hotel is very well positioned. It’s within walking distance to the Barri Gotic (15 minutes) and 20 minutes to La Sagrada Familia. We walked with a 7 year old child and he never complained about the distance.

Our very elegant room on the top floor was ready at 9:00am, when we arrived from the airport.  We were taken to the room by Celine (Guest and Public Relations) who made us feel as we had arrived to a friends’ house. We loved the large room, large bathroom and the jacuzzi in the bathroom, although it took us some time to work out how to operate it. A piece of plastic with instructions how to change the water flow options, is also used to operate the jacuzzi.

While our room was on the top floor, we stayed some time at the lounge and had breakfast every day at the restaurant (both located at the ground floor) and never felt any tremors as mentioned by some reviewers. The room was very quiet, away from the main road.

During our stay we were impressed with the quick and efficient porter and valet service. We rate this hotel as the friendliest of all the hotels we stayed in Spain. This is because of the Guest and Public Relations staff (Celine and Katharina). Every time we were in the lobby, Celineor Katharina would appear and have an informal chat, while recommending sites and making sure we were happy. We don’t like using a concierge, but because we were approached informally, we listened and did take some of the advice which was useful. We really loved chatting to Celine, because she made us feel as we weren’t alone in Barcelona, but had a friend!

In room dining options were bizarre and expensive, and we found nothing for our 7 year old son.  

I don’t think you can find a better and friendlier hotel in Barcelona.",5,2012,07,30
29,The Former Ritz!,"Many people do not know that this beautiful grand hotel was the former Ritz. The hotel was built in 1919, yet the rooms are very spacious and everything is very modern and clean. I have no complaints other than the Gym is extremely small and a hotel of this ranking probably deserves a true full-scale fitness center such as Le Palais in Prague.  El Palace  Hotel is truly a Leading Hotel of the World!!!",5,2012,07,28
29,Elegant hotel missing a pool,"Elegant hotel centrally located to shopping and the old city.  The concierge is very helpful makjng reservations.  Bed is compfortable  Room is clean,  nicely appointed. Bathroom is lovely.   The few kinks:  the phone is complicated and no one explains to you how to use it.  Every time we needed something I had to walk down to the the concierge.  There is no clock in the room which is very annoying and finally the first night when we went to bed, housekeeping never gave us a blanket.  The only thing we had to cover ourselves was a sheet.  I assume that is an aberration.  The spa is so-so (fair at best) and there is no pool to relax at after a long day walking around Barcelona.  Breakfast is very good.  Place is dead at night.  Not a happening place.",5,2012,07,27
29,Wonderful experience,"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of this bustling beautiful City.  The entire staff was excellent.  Check in was efficient. The Concierge was helpful in locating various attractions.  The Michelin rated restaurant is a must!  We were fortunate enough to eat dinner in the kitchen and watched these artist perfect their craft.  I would warn you that if you are a light sleeper you will want a higher level floor.  There is noise from the underground metro and the bar which is actually below the main floor but both can be heard from the first floor rooms.  My wife and I were exhausted from the days spent roaming the city and fell fast asleep, but if you are a light sleeper request higher floor.  Overall one of the finest stays I've had in Europe!",5,2012,07,27
29,A very relaxing & luxurious place to stay,"We stayed 2 nights with our 16 month old toddler. 
Busy at check-in but still quick & efficient. Porter gave us a quick tour of the hotel on the way to our room then explained where everything was in the room & how to work everything. He was very professional & welcoming. 
Deluxe room on 1st floor- very quiet, gorgeous spacious room with high ceilings. Bathroom was lovely & also spacious. Small accessible balcony. The hotel supplied a normal comfy crib for our baby rather than a small porta-cot. 
They have a pillow menu which we used. 
No Tea/coffee making facilities in room & expensive to order at the bar- €6 espresso! We didn't eat at the hotel & the Caelis restaurant was closed during our stay. 
The babysitter service is expensive €20/hr + cab fee & it's actually housekeeping who organise the babysitter so you don't really know wether they are fully qualified/ checked. I chose to use a babysitting agency during our stay. 
Great location, you can walk everywhere & the taxi's are quick & reliable from the hotel. 
",5,2012,07,23
29,old world elegance in barcelona,"My wife and I recently returned from a two night stay at the Palace prior to leaving on a seabourn cruise. The property was old world elegance. Staff excellent and courteous. Check in a breeze. Keys are old style, not the current card type. You give your keys back to the concierge when you leave the hotel. Location was central and perfect. Three blocks and make a right to find great shopping and gaudi architecture on the passieg de gracia; make a left and you're on the Ramblas.
Preferred this location than to the Ritz Arts and Westin which are beachfront but a long walk away from the action. Room was lovely, with fireplace. Bathroom with great shower, tub and upscale amenities. Free Internet access in room is wired; wifi free in lobby. We ate at the Hotel's Michelin rated restaurant and had a truly great, memorable meal. Would highly recommend it.",5,2012,07,19
29,What a great hotel!,"From the moment I stepped into this hotel, I was blown away by the service. Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff that spoke English and was more than happy to help in every way possible is what I loved most. The hotel smells great - from the lobby to the bathrooms! Room service and housekeeping was quick and efficient. Great rain shower and L'Occitane products. Great location - just 2 blocks away from Passeig de Gracia which is sure to have all your shopping needs. Everything about the hotel is perfect aside from the fact that WiFi is only free in the lobby. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.",5,2012,07,14
29,Elegant Old World Hospitality,"This hotel is world class.

We were given a suite upgrade during our stay in Barcelona and I have to say of the rooms I've booked in four and five-star hotels, this one impressed me the most. It was not lavish, but tastefully appointed, luxurious and clean. The bathroom and bath amenities, a standard by which many hotels fail to make the cut, were among the most elegant and spacious I've seen, modern in design, L'Occitane bath products, with a jacuzzi tub and glass-doored marble shower; the toilet is discreetly partitioned off by another closing glass door! Our porter took his time in showing us the features of the suite and discuss the amenities with the feeling he was being sincere and friendly rather than performing a routine. All the staff were attentive and gracious, and managed to even book us a last-minute reservation and arranged for transportation to a Michelin-starred restaurant nearby (La Dama) when the restaurant was about to close its kitchen. The lobby itself is beautiful and the feel is very much of a grand old hotel. They do not make many hotels like this anymore.

There is a Michelin-star restaurant here, but on the day we were free the restaurant was closed. The only complaints I might have had was that there was an issue with one of the electrical sockets in the room (they had a technician come up and fix it immediately) and the tea I asked for at the breakfast buffet did not arrive in a timely manner when we had to leave immediately for a tour. Otherwise, it was a perfect experience, and the breakfast pavilion was quite good, with a selection of cheeses and smoked meats.",5,2012,07,12
29,"Great location, great service, great rooms",We stayed El Palace which was such a great location to walk to all the sights we wanted to see.  The bed was one of the most comfortable bed that I've slept on before.  The courtyard view is not great but the room makes up for the view.  The baths are very nice with rain shower heads and jetted tub.  We stayed here and at La Florida (one night) during our trip and the El Palace is by far a better hotel that is truly 5 stars.,5,2012,07,12
29,"Outstanding Hotel, Fantastic Friendly Service","My husband and I spent 10 days at El Palace Hotel, and each day was it's own special delight.  We both agree that the hotel was the principle factor in our enjoyment of the city.  The Palace is, indeed, beautiful, but we felt that the staff really made it particularly special.  One special feature is that a member of the concierge staff (instead of the the front desk) takes and returns room keys upon leaving the returning to the hotel - which is brilliant because it encourages lots of interaction with the people who are employed to make sure guests have a great time.  This makes asking the concierge a casual question very easy.  We found their advice and information to be impeccable, professional - yet very friendly.   

We also had one of the best meals of our life at the modernist, Michelin-starred hotel restaurant ""Caelis.""  The style is European Modern, with each tiny dish was a delicious adventure of taste and texture - often with a sense of humor.  Don't worry about the tiny plates:  there are so many that you won't have room for even that wafer-thin mint!  

Also not to be missed:  A trip downstairs to the upscale mixology bar ""Rien de Rien.""  You will find no better handmade cocktail in the city!  Miguel and Danny are increadibly friendly and passionate about hand crafting the perfect cocktail - exactly to your liking.  And the show they put on while mixing drinks is amazing!  

Our Jr. Suite was spacioius and comfortable - though I wish the concept included a few more drawers.  The in-room internet was flawless and I used it everyday.  Laundry service was excellent and speedy.  And the bathrooms were fantastic! It included a wonderful whirlpool tub, rain shower, dual sinks and a long shelf below the sinks to keep all our vanity items out of site.  Room service, (housekeeping and food/wine delivery) was perfect.   I am so glad we made the right choice in accomodations - it really made out trip.",5,2012,07,09
29,"Only very good, not excellent!","El Palace is sumptuously decorated and the interior is classic palace style but once you get past the tassels and the velvet, it's the basics that matter.
Ok, down to the facts. We had a standard room and although fairly spacious and ""nice"" it didn't live up to expectations based on the glowing reviews we'd read.
The good: bathroom- big,spotless and THE best rainshower and double sized cubicle. Quality toiletries L'Occitane. Robes, slippers and a proper hairdryer not one of those dreadful efforts attached to the wall.
Quiet room, decent view for city centre, comfy armchairs.
The bad: the bed was the worst thing and it's the most important item in the room! It was too short (I'm 5ft 10"") and hard. The kingsize was actually 2 mattresses zipped together with the uncomfortable ridge down the middle and when we asked if they had rooms with one big mattress, we were told ""No, every hotel's like this."" The hard, short bed was made even worse by hard sponge toppers (not memory foam). Quality beds don't need toppers.
Synthetic pillows- it took 2 phone calls to acquire down pillows and even then they weren't comfortable...so much for the pillow menu.
The much celebrated ""mirror"" television turned out to have only a small portion of the mirror as the screen, less than 30"" and it reflected badly.
Wifi was only free in the lobby or business centre, you had to pay for it in your room.
The service was every bit as good as you'd expect (apart from the comment regarding the mattress!) and the concierge was a mine of information. Beware, however, if you book parking online when you book your room. The screen indicated we had paid for 3 days, but when we checked out, reception said we hadn't paid. They said we should have ""told"" them when we checked in but noone mentioned parking at that stage...they were too busy showing us the mirror tele etc!!
Overall, yes it's a nice place to stay but we probably wouldn't stay there again as it just wasn't good enough to want to go back.",4,2012,07,09
29,El Palace in Barcelona,We had a wonderful stay here.  We especially liked that we could have a beautifully served cup of latte (in stunning china and served with lovely chocolates and biscuits) before we left every morning for our adventure.  We also received perfect directions and great advice throughout our weekend stay.,5,2012,07,09
29,Great service but no pool,"beautifully fitted out with ornate fittings and furniture, great position in City of Barcelona, nice staff very helpful but no pool the only downside.",4,2012,07,09

29,"Wonderful, real 5-star hotel","It's wonderful place and so as not to be duplicative here is a tidbit: you will waltz into another era and know you have entered a place like no other when you smell the lovely perfumed air in this place.  Ahhh, such a special hotel.",5,2012,07,07
29,Best Hotel in Barcelona!,"This is easily the best hotel I've ever stayed in. What a great choice to have in such a great city! I stayed here for 5 days, one of which was during the country-wide protests, and even THEN the service was fantastic! All of the staff speak English, but they are also happy to speak to you in Spanish if you are still learning the language. While it can be expensive, the quality and service are all worth it. The concierge was especially helpful! The rooms are VERY nice, and the whole place is cleaner than clean.
I wish I could give this place a 6 out of 5.",5,2012,07,05
29,Opulent and stylish,The El Palace is indeed palatial and did not disappoint. One of the grandest 5 star establishment we had the pleasure to experience in Spain. Our spacious room was impeccable: from the crisp bedding to the various amenities in the large bathroom. Copious but pricey breakfast. Polite but a bit starchy staff. Excellent location in the heart of this wonderful city. Would love to come back!,5,2012,07,01
29,A wonderful hotel in the heart of Barcelona.,"We stayed for two nights and had a very nice time. All is perfect apart from a few minor details.

++
- had requested a high floor and got room 610 on the top floor, great room.
- wonderful scent in the hotel
- the lobby and hall are stunning 
- service is great from the minute you're out of the taxi in front of the hotel
- great bathroom.

--

- wifi: had to go to the lobby and do a complicated code different every time. Not ok with the price of the hotel.

- bed: blanket instead of proper feather plush style. Really not level with the rest.",5,2012,06,30
29,Not quite perfect,Staff is wonderful and the property is gorgeous. Something about lack of room service at certain times and small other things make it seem less than perfect for a five star property.,4,2012,06,22
29,A luxurious hotel in the heart of this great city,"The El Palace hotel is Barcelona is a beautiful hotel in a very convenient location.  The hotel is located in the centre of the city on Gran Via, just a short walk from Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla and some of the major Gaudi buildings such as casa Batllo and La Pedrera.  The hotel is decorated in traditional opulent style and the service evokes a similar era.  Check in was slick, if a little formal.  The public areas of the hotel are immaculate, nothing appears worn or patched up.  We were upgraded to a junior suite as we were a family of three.  The room, probably the best I have stayed in, was very large and extremely well appointed in same traditional style that pervades the hotel but with very modern touches, such as mood lighting, flat screen television etc.  There was a separate walk in closet so cases and clothes weren’t cluttering the main room.  The bathroom was amazing, it had double rain shower, a whirlpool batch all expensively done in marble, chrome and glass.  Being in such a convenient location there is no need to eat in the hotel and the restaurant did appear quite formal.  We did have breakfast on two of our four mornings.  Choice was extensive and food was good quality but at 70 euros for the three of us we found a café just along Gran Via which did more English style breakfasts at a fraction of the price.

The hotel doesn’t have an indoor or outdoor swimming pool so that maybe something to consider if you travel to Barcelona in the height of summer.  Also, if minimalist boutique style hotels are more your thing then the El Palace might not be for you.  It is a grand European hotel in the traditional style both in terms of décor and service. It is not the cheapest hotel in Barcelona, neither is it the most expensive, but all factors considered it was probably the best value without making any compromises.",5,2012,06,21
29,Excellent Service and Pretty Large Rooms,"Deluxe five star hotel!  Really the only true five star hotel we experienced in Spain.  Very helpful concierge, lavish lobby interior, and beautiful breakfast terrace room.  Lots of nice bath ammenities, orchid plant in the bath, newly refurbished rooms, great pillow selection, teriffic rain shower, wonderful beds and attentive housekeeping. Good location.",5,2012,06,18
29,Great hotel,"There are cities in which quaint, boutique hotels leave a lasting impression, and then cities in which opulent, luxurious hotels do the same.  My Barcelona experience was really enhanced by staying at the El Palace.  It's not cheap, but if you do some research, you'll discover that some really unimpressive hotels are not much cheaper, and this place is anything but unimpressive. The service is first class; the breakfast buffet is impressive, and the location is handy for shopping, pubs and restaurants.  This used to be the Ritz, and it still feels like it but perhaps without that thick layer of snobbiness that accompanies some of the really uppercrust hotels.  I'd come back here in a minute. 

One final word: if you do stay, make sure you check out the wonderful bakery (not part of the hotel) on the same side of the hotel but across the street from it.  Amazing coffee, great pastries, and breads.  You can eat cheaply here if you're looking to economize in some way.",5,2012,06,18
29,Best Hotel In The World,"Good Lord.  I cannot say enough.  The location is perfect.  The decor is completely off the chart.  It is modern but yet cozy and continental.  Lovely staff...lovely service. beautiful room and bed.  Incredible bathroom (best ever  for Europe),  I would go back to Barcelona jut for the hotel.  Loved it in every way.  The breakfast includes beautiful unlimited cava champagne and it is in the most incredible atrium of all time... please just go!!!!",5,2012,06,13
29,Beautiful hotel and fabulous location,"Front desk personnel could not have been any better.  Rooms were lovely, but the functionality of the bathroom (recently renovated) certainly could have been improved upon.  Loved having the separate shower and bathtub, but no place to hang wet towels.  The quality of the towels & bathrobes was not what I expect from a 5 star hotel.  Housekeeping personnel definitely need more training.  They did not consistently replace shower gel, shower caps, washcloths or towels at the requested level and had to call down for additional items four of the five nights we stayed.

I really expected more considering the $$$$ we were spending.",4,2012,06,12
29,Nice Hotel Close to Downtown,Elegant hotel.  Close to places of interrest.  Very clean and friendly.   Food very expensive as you would expect.  Very quite even though on main street.,5,2012,06,09
29,I would come back here in a hearbeat!,"My friend and I visited Barcelona in March and had a fabulous time.  The El Palace Hotel contributed to making the trip wonderful.  The concierge desk could not have been more helpful, booking restaurants for us before we even arrived, helping with local transport and general good ideas. Very pleasant and friendly.  Our room was lovely and very clean, we had two single beds and plenty of space - the bathroom was huge!

The location is perfect - very central and also walkable to the warterfront and gothic quarter.
Have to say that we didn't see any reason to go to The Rambles unless you are young and going for the nightlife, and even then, there are better locations.  Keep your bags close, pickpockets are big problem",5,2012,06,04

29,Expensive and small,"Stayed two nits, we got a nice Barcelona city street view, room is okay, small though. With this price, I think they should offer a better services. Wifi didn't work well in the room. We always have to come to the lobby for wifi services.",3,2012,05,27
29,Lovely Hotel!,"Loved El Palace Hotel. It is a beautiful, old, historic hotel in a central location in Barcelona. It was formerly a Four Seasons property and retains a strong sense of old world elegance. It is in easy walking distance to all the fascinations of Los Rambles and many wonderful nearby restaurants. The hotel is elegant and beautifully decorated with wonderful antiques. The rooms are impeccable, comfortable, clean and quiet, ours with an interesting city view. The beds are wonderful, the bathrooms modern and comfortable and we appreciated the orchids in the bathroom! The staff are welcoming, helpful and professional. We loved Barcelona and highly recommend El Palace Hotel. It provides an elegant perch from which to explore wonderful Barcelona.",5,2012,05,26
29,"Elegant and old fashioned, would be great for older folks","I stayed at El Palace in Barcelona in June 2011.  Overall, the hotel was beautiful in a very opulent, old-world way.  We got upgraded to a junior suite, as it was the off season for the hotel, and were really pleased with the comfort of the bed and the spacious bathroom (there were actually two full rooms, one with the shower/bath and the other with the toilet). Their shower amenities were the best I've seen with L'Occitane's Citrus Verbana collection (which I loved so much, I bought full bottles when I got home).  Service was attentive and very pleasant, we were always greeted with a smile whenever we entered a common room. We never ate at the hotel so I have no comment there although the Caelis restaurant is supposed to be lovely.  

Two things I would note as negatives are as follows:
1) The hotel really is geared towards older travelers and does not have the fun atmosphere of a place like the W hotel on La Barceloneta.  While I thought my stay was lovely, I will likely stay elsewhere on my next trip as I prefer a younger and livelier crowd.  I would not hesitate to stay here again if I were vacationing with, say, my parents.

2) There are computers available in one of the common rooms but we had internet and sign-in issues two of the three times we attempted to use them.  Both times the staff was attentive and worked to eventually solve the problem but it was certainly an annoyance.  An upgrade to the computers (which were very old) would really help as everyone now needs internet connection, even while vacationing.  

Just to reiterate, this was a lovely, elegant hotel with a lot of old world glamour and great service, but if you are a young couple looking for a fun place, this may not be the right fit for you.",4,2012,05,21
29,One word - Amazing!!,"My mother and I spent 4 nights at the hotel in early May and it was fantastic!  This was one of my favorite hotels in all of Europe and definitely my favorite in Spain.  Although everything was great, the people at the concierge were the absolute best.  I don't think I have ever encountered such helpful, lovely, polite and knowledgeable concierge professionals.  The entire staff always had a smile and made us feel so at home.  We called housekeeping once and they were at our door in 30 seconds.  We had a little problem with our phone upon checking in and they had a repairman in our room within 10 minutes.  The building and all the public areas were gorgeous and absolutely immaculate!  The bed was wonderful, bathroom was modern and large with generous toiletries.  The breakfast room was in a converted patio which was just lovely.  

The location was fantastic - we could walk everywhere and there was also a taxi stand right across the street.  

My only negative comment is that it would have been nice to get free wi-fi in the room.

I will most definitely stay here on my next trip to Barcelona and will recommend it to all my friends!",5,2012,05,19
29,Very hard to complain about anything here!,"A very professionally run hotel.  Deserves its five stars.  Concierge terrific.  

Small complaint:  At beautiful breakfast buffet, they should offer something other than scrambled eggs.  Many five-star hotels have a cook making eggs and omelets to order.  

Tip:  Several taxi drivers were confused when we asked for El Palace.  So when you take a cab, remind them that El Palace used to be the Ritz.",5,2012,05,18
29,A wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and our stay at El Palace was the perfect place to stay.  Kudos to the concierge services!!  I can't say enough about how wonderful they were.  Because we had never visited Barcelona, we relied heavily on their assistance and recommendations.  Each time we stopped by the desk, they were so accommodating, pulling out their maps to highlight routes to follow, sites to see and good restaurants to try.  Being the foodies that we are, we were skeptical, thinking that they must be recommending places that they have a relationship with, but that couldn't have been further from the truth.  Their restaurant recommendations were spot on!  
The room was lovely too, with a very large closet.  Where I think they can do better is on their bed and pillows.  The bed was very hard and it was only after requesting a featherbed to soften it (which they graciously provided), and feather pillows, was it comfortable to sleep in.  Also, for safety reasons, they need to provide a highlight in the bathroom for those middle of the night visits.  Overall, the place is fabulous and I would most definitely stay there on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2012,05,18
29,A TIMELESS CLASSIC,"This hotel has been elegantly and delicately furbished and leaves up to all expectations.
it is located in the heart of the city wihin and easy and relaxing walking distance to the main attractions.
it has and elegant residential feel about it. 
The rooms offer a warm and inviting atmosphere within, decorated with beautiful fabrics.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and highly recommended.",5,2012,05,11
29,What a pleasure!,"We stayed 4 nights after our cruise.  We are so glad we stayed here.  Our stay was in a beautifully decorated room facing the Gran Via.  The furnishings were classic, bed comfortable, A/C worked quietly, and all was clean.  The bath was best we have seen in Europe: Roman tub, big shower with rain or spray head, 2 sinks and fine soaps and accessories.  The location is great: just a few blocks to La Rambla and Passeig.  But quiet at night.  Good food in restaurants and great breakfast buffet in quiet garden.   I cannot say enough about staff.  Reception was efficient; Concierge helped with reservations, taxi, advice; Housekeeping provided all extras needed.  The Executive Housekeeper even had our personal pillow cases (for special pillows we brought) cleaned; and she personally delivered them.  Thanks Pipa!",5,2012,05,07
29,A Barcelona winner!,"This was my 4th trip to Barcelona and this hotel made the difference from really like to love. We arrived at 8AM and our (upgraded) junior suite was ready. Really important after a 9 hour trip. The room was and remained through our 5 day stay immaculate. The room was large for a European city and the bathroom was enormous and extremely modern and well appointed. Big walkin shower with huge  rain head, plus jet tub, double sinks, and enclosed toilet, etc.

The location was great. 2 blocks from the Passeig de Gracia.Turn left and walk to the Plaza Catalunya and walk the Rambla and/or the barri gotic. Turn right and feast upon Gaudi buildings, and upscale shopping if that's what you like. Lovely little park area. however, you must taxi or bus to the Sagrada Familia and the Parc Guell. If you are in Barcelona on a Sunday be sure to go to the Gotic Cathedral around noon to watch the ""sardana"" the folk dancing accompanied by an orchestra on the steps of the cathedral. That was great.

The staff of the hotel was the best, especially the concierge desk. Breakfast was really good and the room or courtyard was incredibly beautiful. This hotel was formerly the Ritz which you must tell your taxi driver as there is more than 1 palace hotel in the city. I would  go back to this hotel in a heart beat,it was that good.",4,2012,04,29
29,Wonderful Staff And Great Location for Walking,"Staff was warm and welcoming, considering we arrived at night during a football match, FC Barcelona vs. Real Madrid. Spain is a football crazed country. Our room was large, with huge bathroom. Walking from the hotel to most all tourist areas was convenent.",5,2012,04,28
29,Wonderful experience,"Really great hotel. Very grand and impressive.  Believe was formerly The Ritz. Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful/attentive. Breakfast good in really nice surroundings. The cocktail bar entertainment was a real highlight for us but closed Sunday and Monday.  The Michelin Star restaurant was overly formal and the food tepid...but we enjoyed the experience (we enjoyed the wine selection and giggled through each food course). better to eat out or in the hotel's 
less formal restaurant. We walked for 4.5 hours Sunday eve looking for somewhere decent to eat. I would highly recommend Sensi, Calle Ample 26 close to marina excellent tapas, service and great wine. Lots of places closed sunday so do your research.  We got very used to enjoying the Roman bath together before bed and we are now thinking of having one installed at home! Overall - Expensive but worth it.",4,2012,04,28
29,Luxurious,"This is a beautiful luxurious hotel. The rooms are clean and of high quality, the service is second to none. The breakfast is delicious with lots of choice. The location is very close to the metro, tour buses and attractions. The only down side was there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.",5,2012,04,25
29,Very Good,Beautiful hotel. Excellent service. Arrived the day of the general strike which was interesting. Excellent location close to almost everything you want to see or do. Signed up for the gastronomic experience at their Michelin starred restaurant and it did not disapoint as it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Rooms were comfortable. Three minor complaints: 1) the drapes were so large and heavy the windows could not be fully opened 2)no wi-fi in rooms 3)for the price breakfast should be included.,4,2012,04,24
29,Great hotel in a great location,"We spent our 'mini-moon' at the hotel El Palace and had a wonderful 4 night stay. The hotel interiors are very grand and ornate yet have a very 'new' and fresh feel.

Our room, on the 5th floor was very quiet, clean and well decorated. The bathroom was beautiful, a small bath, seperate shower cubicle with rainfall shower and hand held attachment (ideal if you do not wish to get your hair wet every time you shower) and a WC with its own door. The bed was very comfortable although it was 2 beds pushed together to form a super king - a pet hate of mine. Rooms do not come with an iron or ironing board. There is an ironing service offered at a (high) charge but we phoned down to reception and they brought both within 5 minutes of our call. 

Room keys are of the old style with an enormous tassle on. This is presumably to encourage you to hand in the key to the concierge before leaving the hotel. This was no problem for us and we never had to wait for our key even when arriving back to the hotel after midnight. The concierge was very helpful for us, booking restaurants and giving recommendations, they also helped us get FC Barcelona tickets before we arrived.

We did not eat in the hotel and there really was no need. The Palace is situated near a plethora of cafes, tapas bars and restaurants. We were a 10 minute stroll from the nearest metro or Placa de la Catyluna and the start of Las Ramblas. We could not have picked a better location. 

We had a fab stay in Barcelona and a lot of that was down to our choice of hotel. After a hectic day walking the streets of the gothic quarter and las ramblas it was lovely to come back to a calm, quiet hotel for some rest and relaxation.",5,2012,04,23
29,Beautiful,"The hotel has clearly had a lot of TLC on it.  They have kept the traditional feel but at the sametime our room was modern and very up to date.  We stayed in a Junior Suite (423).  Having travelled with hand luggage only the toliteries are very welcome, including a wet razor.  We were shown to our room which had a welcome plate of fruit and a bottle of water.  Only observation here, is that the water was not replaced and the fruit plate was removed before everything was eaten.  The hotel is ideally located for exploring Barcelona but I receommend a room at the rear, although we had air conditioning it was nice to open the windows.  I did think the description of overlooking a traditional courtyard was a bit of a stretch but it depends on what you consider a traditional courtyard.  Staff could not do enough for you and the Cocktail bar is like stepping back in time to a 1930's era.  Cocktails range from €12 - €18.  We did not eat at the hotel as we like to find somewhere where the locals eat.  As any City the tourist areas rip you off in charges.  The fitness room is free but there are charges for the Spa.  Cannot comment on these as we did not use them.   Also I do think that in this day and age Wi-Fi should be free. Would we stay at the hotel again - YES!",4,2012,04,21
29,Almost a five-star experience,"Our five-day vacation stay at this well-located hotel was largely pleasant, mostly due to the very professional and helpful staff.  The large opulent lobby area impresses with old-style luxury hotel atmosphere and plenty of comfy sofas, while the rooms are nice but not particularly special as compared to other five-star hotel rooms.  The room seemed smaller than indicated which probably reflects including in the advertised size, the ""dead"" space hallway leading into the room and the large bath area, which included both a shower and a regular bathtub.  The shower only had a tiny plastic soap dish to hold the soap, shampoo, conditioner - not to mention my face wash, razor, shaving lotion - so some things had to be put on the shower floor and other things kept falling off the tiny dish. I guess this is a typical design with no function issue.  The smallish working desk didn't have a desk lamp; the only lighting being ceiling downlights that could only all be turned on at once, making it difficult for one person to work at the desk while the other went to bed earlier or got up later.  After I requested a desk lamp, the hotel did put one in.  Ask for one when you check-in to avoid loss of sleep and irritation!.  More irritating is that this pricey hotel charges for in-room wifi (15 Euro per day) while offering a cable-internet connection in the room.  When paying over 400 Euro a day for a smallish room, I expect to get the wifi free.  I also disliked the bedding, this must be the first 5-star hotel I have stayed in that does not have high-quality sheets and duvets.  The sheets felt and looked basic, no choice of pillows, and worst of all, there was only a thin brown blanket(doesn't feel ""fresh"" or comfy)  stretched across the king-size bed.  Perhaps I am spoiled (I  spend about 75 hotel nights a year in 4 or 5 star hotels), but I like a down or feather duvet - one for each side of the bed but big enough to share.  Surprisingly there were only 2 bath towels and 2 hand towels in the room - no wash cloth and no extra bath towel for drying hair (we were two in the room).  The towels were standard size and rather worn: thin and even fraying on the edges.  The closet and clothing storage area is located in the bath area, which some may find less convenient. The armchair in our room was soiled from use (brownish discoloration on the arm rests and the front of the seat area), making it unattractive to sit on. The breakfast cost 28 Euro per person, and was pretty standard fare.  I would have liked more fruits - I was disappointed there were no berries (all over Europe there are Spanish strawberries sold cheaply now).  The breakfast room is a canvas covered outdoor garden and a bit cold.  One morning we were put by the door to the patio where smokers go and it was very cold with the door frequently opening (and often being left open).  I was surprised that when we sat in the lobby, no one ever came up and asked if we would like to order some coffee or a drink (a couple of times we sat for 20 - 30 minutes and staff would merely walk by, even though the lobby was nearly empty).  But when I tracked down the bartender and ordered tea, it was very nicely served.   The location of the hotel is good. Barcelona boasts many high-end and other hotels may offer more real luxury for the price.   If you want heavy drapes, lots of gold and gild, embossed wall-paper, and ""old-world luxury"", this hotel may suit you.  If so, ask for a high-floor room (only 6 floors) to avoid traffic noise, (you can still hear the subway rumble if the room is quiet and you're not distracted.  This did not bother us but might a light sleeper.)",4,2012,04,18
29,"The real ""Palace"" experience","Do you ever overlook the pictures of other tourists who have been in the hotel? Then don't do for this hotel as El Palace is much much better than the pictures taken by tourists. The luxury of El Palace is not only in the grand building and old-style design but in all details you could find in this hotel: bed, bed linen, lights in the room, shower amenities, toiletries, etc. Besides the staff only adds to the perfectness, as all of them will treat you as the most welcomed guest  in the hotel. 

If you find the official photos of the hotel intriguing then I promise - you won't be disappointed. And there is no much more things to add, as this is the hotel that has to be enjoyed not described :)

 If You stay in the hotel then the breakfast (although for additional cost) is a must. This will be only one more extra treat for you. Unfortunately I didn't have opportunity to enjoy the restaurant by R. Fornell (as there were the private party) but would like to think that this is a very  special experience, as well. 

(One more thing to add, that rarely is mentioned in the hotel reviews in the positive light: the smell.) The scent in this hotel was very special: so fresh and clean.  

I truly enjoyed every second of stay in this hotel and would definitely like to return  to celebrate the very special occasions of my life.",5,2012,04,16
29,El Palace....a Wonderful Hotel.,"We stayed at the El Palace Hotel in March 2012.  The hotel was wonderful from the doorman to front desk to the concierge to the restaurant and bar staff.  Our room was spacious, well appointed, and in almost new condition.  We only stayed one night, a stopover to catch a cruise out of Barcelona, and wish we'd had more time to explore the city and take advantage of a great hotel.",5,2012,04,13
29,Hands down the best hotel in Spain,"If you like opulent interiors with silk and velvet drapes, cozy beautiful furniture of the last centuries combined with technology and convenience of the modern civilization than El Palace hotel in Barcelona will impress you. Contemporary big bathrooms with a separate toilet, with cascade shower for those who like being washed by the rain, or a more traditional (the boring one) as well. The lavish rooms are big, equipped with Mirror/TV and fireplace, and very, very quite thanks to the little hallway separating the entry and the room itself by a door. The beds are very comfortable. We had our breakfast in a garden area of the hotel. So delicious and the verity is of great restaurants. Don't forget to enjoy the Rein de Rein lounge downstairs where local jazz bands often perform. Special thanks to Javier, who was so helpfull not only with our luggage, but with other things, like recommendations and letting us feel very welcome and taken care of. Next time i'm in Barcelona, El Palace is my home.",5,2012,04,13
29,Centrally located 5 star hotel,"Our family holiday started in Barcelona. We arrived early, as usual, normal check in time was 3pm. I asked for 1 room for my elderly parents, they accommodated my request and found a room. All the staff were very courteous and assisted in finding us restaurants and attractions.
The buffet breakfast is excellent.
The rooms were quite spacious, the facilities have been renovated.
The location is close to Catalunya Square, easy walking distance to La Rambla.
Definitely will come back.",5,2012,04,13
29,great place all around,"This hotel is completely centrally located. The staff is top notch. Francisco at the Concierge station got us front row tix to a Catalan guitar concert in the Music Hall, an expert guide for a walking tour of the sites, the best restaurant recommendations, etc. Room service was at the door minutes after calling. The entire place was completely restored just 2 years ago and simply looks like the 1919 Ritz but brand new.",5,2012,04,13
29,Sophisticated and Refined,"We stayed here over Easter. The hotel has been remodelled,, but has tried to capture the service levels of the bygone ritz era. The staff are lovely, particularly the bar man, we did not capture his name, and service is impeccable. Reception staff slightly arrogant, but the bar staff, concierge, the guy who helps with your luggage, to the breakfast staff are all great and make up for it.

Breakfast is lovely in the breakfast room, room service is incredibly quick and efficient. The rooms are not overly spacious, but the bathrooms are huge and the shower and toiletries fantastic.

The staff are dressed in a very old fashioned way,,,with bow ties, tails, white dinner jackets etc, but everything is very personal. It's simply a very old fashioned, personal service. The hotel, although busy, never really feels it, other than at breakfast.

The location is great, walking distance to everything, and you will spend your days out and about easily. We had an interior room on the third floor and there was absolutely no noise at all, it was deadly quiet.

So if you are looking for an old fashioned, refined, personal service, this hotel is one of the best. If you are looking for trendy and fun, then this is not for you.",4,2012,04,10
29,"Great Service, Location and Installations","I tried The Palace Hotel for the first time last month, it was a great experience. My first stay here was back when it was a Ritz but the new name also comes with new rooms, menu, and a complete remodel but keeping the classic feel to the property. Food at the bar is very good, service overall excellent. 
I should mention that we found out about a general city strike during our stay and asked the front desk to change our checkout date for a day earlier, was told a charge for the non used night was going to apply, I asked for no charge on this and was told no, not happy but I understood it was their right to do so, so no hard feelings there. HOWEVER, two minutes after I hung up, the person at front desk called and informed me that there was not going to be a charge. It was their option and took the side of the customer.
Do not miss the ham and tomato bread, had it 5 times during our stay and would take home if they let me.",5,2012,04,08
29,Wonderful First Stay in Barcelona,"This hotel has spoiled me for any other break!  The furnishings are very opulent and traditional yet it's bang up to date with the bathroom, TV in the mirror and so on.  
 We stayed as a family in the classic room with our fifteen year old daughter and she loved it, although there was a slight problem with the lights flickering and she thought it seemed like the Hollywood Tower of Terror (Disney) hotel!  
 The position was great for getting around on foot to see all of the sights and, after reading recommendations on this site about asking for a higher room, we found it very peaceful and quiet when we needed to recharge our batteries! That said, I never noticed any ""rumbling"" from the underground even when we were on the ground floor.
 Unfortunately the restaurant was closed for our four day trip, 2-6th April, due to holidays but we asked for recommendations from concierge and they were great! The staff were all helpful and friendly and I'd definitely love to return but I'd hope for less rain next time! 
 
 A lovely break and it would be great to stay here again.",5,2012,04,08
29,Stately and elegant,"Beautifully decorated and elegant hotel.   The lounge is spectacular. The staff was exceptionally helpful and courteous in planning our excursions.  The location is superb for walking to shopping and restaurants.   Prices in the bars/lounges are quite high, but that is to be expected at a Ritz.   There is a sports bar across the street that is a great place when Barcelona Soccer is playing (especially if they win.)  If you have the ""loot,"" it is a terrific place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,04,07
29,Awesome Stay!!,"We stayed at the El Palace for four nights during our recent visit to Barcelona. It was an incredible stay. The location is really perfect for exploring Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, and L'Eixample. Walking into the hotel, it really feels like you are walking back in time with old-fashioned service and a beautiful lobby area. Also, make sure to eat at the Hotel Restaurant, Caelis. They definitely deserve their Michelin Star.  All in all, a great experience!!",5,2012,04,02
29,Luxurious Old World Charm with Modern Amenities,"El Palace offers the feeling of comfort in a convenient downtown location.  It is within walking distance of the Rambla and the shopping on Gracias.  The junior suite offered even more than we had imagined. 
 
- breakfast in the garden room offers a large variety of foods
 
-mattress was very comfortable

-staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  They assisted us in having a rental car delivered to continue our exploration of Catalan.

-the club on Saturday night had a very good jazz group and meeting some of the locals made it very special

We will return for a future visit.

29,Charming,"We would definetly stay again.
Advantages:
- Excellent location
- Wonderful kids amenities (they provided everything we needed and presented our boy a toy which he loved)
- Excellent breakfast
- Wonderful friendly and helpful staff
- I liked the style of decoration, very gorgeous

Areas of improvement:
- No free wifi in rooms

Note:
To park the car with special prices you should ask the help of the porter",5,2012,03,27
29,Old world charm in the middle of the city,"After staying at a bunch of hotels in Barcelona, El Palace combine the charm of old world luxury with re-done rooms, VERY friendly staff right in the middle of Barcelona.

Had brunch at hotel, which was very nice in the garden.  Room was very comfortable and clean.  I would stay there again.",4,2012,03,22
29,Barcelona Fiftieth,"We chose this hotel through a Thomas Cook Flexible trip brochure and on recommendation from an experienced travel consultant at a local Thomas Cook travel agency. It was to celebrate a fiftieth birthday with a week’s stay in a luxury five star hotel. The break was to be a surprise for my partner, but the cat was let out of the bag, when Thomas Cook sent through marked envelopes in the post with their name on the outside. 

Our destination was the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona flying with Easyjet with a private taxi transfer to our hotel.

We got caught up in the bag fiasco at Gatwick airport (power outage on the conveyor belt), but luckily our baggage was transferred without any delay to our destination.

We found the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona a very luxurious hotel with the following excellent points: -
1.	Excellent customer service
2.	Excellent accommodation
3.	Excellent food
4.	Excellent location
5.	Friendly and helpful staff

The only downside we had a very slow draining bathroom sink after a few days which was not rectified on our first mention of it. It was rectified on the second mention.

The prices for hotel extras we found to be a little on the expensive side, but for a five star hotel I suppose this is to be expected. Overall prices for most items in Barcelona were expensive in comparison to the UK.

If a quiet stay is required, then this is not the right hotel, as it is located on one the main roads into Barcelona. We found our room to be well insulated from the traffic noise though, and we slept soundly on very comfortable beds.

The hotel staff assisted us with excellent service in re-arranging our pick up time on our return journey back to the UK, as this was booked for 5:45am in the morning for a 10:55 flight back to the UK. We did ask the staff at our local Thomas Cook agency to change this, but did not find them very helpful in accommodating this.

Overall our stay was very enjoyable and we would not hesitate in returning to this hotel again.",5,2012,03,18
29,amazing,"Fab hotel, great location. Defiantly has the wow factor as soon as you walk through the door. Service impeccable. Breakfast is served in a heated garden room and is the best buffet breakfast I have ever had. It was my first romantic weekend away with my new boyfriend and it was a dream. Highly recommend it. Shopping in Barca is great to and just outside your door. Head to the markets for the most amazing colours and vibrancy. Enjoy x",5,2012,03,07
29,first class,"This is an excellent hotel where everything is 'just so'. The staff are attentive without being obtrusive, the hotel is very comfortable and spacious with beautiful decor, and an air of efficient calm pervades. We ate in the Caelis Restaurant one night (reviewed separately) and only took breakfast - which was an extensive and delicious buffet. You can stay in this hotel with confidence.",5,2012,03,04
29,Great Location,The hotel is perfectly located for sightseeing.  This beautiful old hotel is very focused on good service and there was always a member of staff to cater for every reqirement.  The breakfast was 30 euros but all visitors receive a 50 euros voucher for the restaurants so we used it on breakfast and we were not disappointed.  The food and garden room setting were a highlight of our stay. The classic room was large and totally adequate.  If you prefer to use the bath please note it is small.,5,2012,03,04
29,A historical hotel offering a modern experience,"I stayed the night of 29th of feb at el palace barcelona, this hotel is one of the ritz building this genius has created ! Now it has been revamp with full new deco and works
My room 407 was great ! The deco is very tradi but comfort and fully equiped! The extra the bathroom, former roman bath that make you feel like cesar !!! The l occitane products were great and finally one hotel which offers real quality products !!!! And hand crean toooo !!!
The bfst lounge is in a patio so you can enjoy the morning freshness surrounding by trees buffet is awesome, staff is always keen to help ! I higly rec this place !!! Weel done to the hotel !!!",5,2012,03,03
29,Not bad but far from the top notch rate,"In my arrival the doormen were very attentive, helping with the luggage and took great pains to open the door before I entered. The lobby is so beautiful, a classical palace with beautiful pillars and a mix of light and dark hues.
Once in reception, too many  people to check-in. The first impression is that that’s an understaffing hotel. A negative feature that is just annoying - 15 minutes to check in.

Location - It´s close to the city center, and a metro station is nearby. 10 minutes away from Las Rambla. 

Rooms - The management really should close some of them and use for storage or stock rooms. I was on the second floor and had to change it just minutes after I arrived. In the fifth floor I didn’t notice anything. If you keep your noisy room for all the days, your value of this hotel will be 1/5, instead the 4/5 it can achieve.

Staff – so friendly and pleasure in general, but some of them need training in the luxury service, like the man who took my bags up and receiving no tip (not deserved) slammed the door and frowning when he saw me in the lobby. So rude.

Restaurants – one Michelin star Caellis is brilliant. Don't lose the opportunity to taste this delicious restaurant. The second restaurant is simply part of an open living room, not very suggestive. Not feel like going. 
Breakfast is served in a lovely setting, the food offered is ok but not worth the money.

Gym – Really poor. One of the the worst areas in the hotel. 3 machines and one of them out of service.

It could be a great hotel if taking care of some points but meanwhile  that’s a correct, nice and comfortable hotel far from the top notch rate.",3,2012,03,02
29,Alore and Silvio,"Great Hotel, very good customer service
The Hotel is in Great location 5 Min to Plaça de Catalunya",5,2012,02,27
29,Our stay at the Palace,"My daughter and I just stayed at the Palace for 3 nights.  It was absolutely lovely and I cannot say enough about the excellent level of service we received at the hotel.  All of the staff - especially the concierges went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming.  The room was spotless with a very comfortable bed, great bath products, fantastic shower, etc.  Even though I typically prefer more modern decor, it was fun to be in an 'old world' setting.  The location is great - just a few blocks from Plaza Catalunya and the Passeig de Gracia.  It was nice to be a bit out of the fray but still very close.  I would stay at the Palace again and highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2012,02,24
29,Five Star Heaven,"My husband and I just returned from a fabulous stay at El Palace. What a wonderful luxury hotel in the heart of Barcelona! I loved the hotel's location, which is accessible to all the major areas, eg, The Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia shopping, Gaudi's La Casa Mila,etc. Our room was elegant, yet comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and had every amenity including heated towels, a fabulous rain shower, sunken bathtub and bath products from L'Occitane. Also, I am a very sensitive sleeper and was pleased that I enjoyed 10 peaceful nights at the hotel. In addition, the staff at El Palace is incredible. From Mariano in reception, to Eloi, our bellman and all of the concierge staff - Xavier, Francisco, Alexis, Alex, Michael, we were treated like royalty! Their insight, knowledge, professionalism and advice really made our trip so memorable.",5,2012,02,23
29,Luxury in the centre of Barcelona,"The El Palace is situated on a very busy main through route - the Gran Via de Corts Catalans.
We were concerned that it may be noisy from the road as our room overlooked it but the sound proofing was adequate.
The location is good for access to the City and is 15 mins away from Sagrada Familia in the other direction. 
The service in the hotel is excellent but beware of the prices in the bars, mini bars and spa.
We included breakfast in our price but at €28 each if we hadn't it would have been more than we would have wanted to pay. However if cava and smoked salmon are what you want for breakfast then that price may be about right. We dined out every evening so are unable to comment on the quality of the food. There were not may eating in the restaurant so we wanted  places where there was more atmosphere. In the busier summer months it may of course be rather different.
We had a great week in Barcelona and we enjoyed our experience and stay at El Palace.",5,2012,02,22
29,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I just spent 5 fabulous nights at El Palace. We were greeted with a wonderful aroma in the lobby to wonderful service. Our room  and bathroom were very spacious. The location in Barcelona was absolutely perfect. The concierge Alex, Katherina and Celine with guest relations were so helpful with travel tips and restaurant recommendations. We would recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona. We can't wait to come back. Thank you everyone at El Palace Hotel.",5,2012,02,14
29,"Gorgeous hotel, perfect location","I can't believe it took me this long to write this review of El Palace, because the memory of it has stayed with me in a wonderful way.  From arrival with elegantly dressed doormen who scooped up our luggage and delivered it quickly to the room, to the always helpful and charming concierge desk, to the waiters in the restaurant, everyone at El Palace aimed to serve and please.  Our room overlooked the main street, so I was worried about noise.  Nothing to worry about, and we were only about 3 floors up.  In fact, I spent time out on our balcony looking at the passersby, and the architecture of this grand city.  We had a beautiful marble bathroom, and two comfortable beds with plenty of room and pillows.  Closet space was excellent.  A writing desk to capture our memories at the end of the day.  The decor is opulent and grand throughout the lobby, with many places to sit and start conversation.  Despite the large, open space, it gives off an intimate feel.  I used the hotel computers, stationed adjacent to the lobby, which were high speed and practical.  The formal dining room looked nice, though we didn't eat there since we wanted to spend our money eating out in the many amazing city restaurants.  The breakfast and lunch terrace was nicely decorated and almost felt like you were eating outdoors.  My only complaint was the price for the food.  Breakfast was very expensive.  Thank goodness it tasted good.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  Close to metros.. a couple blocks from bustling Passeig de Gracia which hosts major shopping, terrific restaurants and the extraordinary Gaudi Casa Batllo mansion.  You are maybe a 10-minute walk away from the top of Las Ramblas, and will cross a large, open square getting there, in which you will see everyone from performers to people walking to work.  It was an incredible week.. and I loved calling El Palace home in Barcelona.  We will return!",5,2012,02,14
29,Charming and grand hotel in an unbeatable location,"El Palace is a grand hotel that oozes with old-world character, yet it doesn't sacrifice on the modern amenities that people demand nowadays of top-flight hotels. It's situated in the heart of Barcelona - all of the main attractions are either within walking distance or a short cab ride away.

Service was friendly and helpful - the concierge patiently explained the ins and outs of Barcelona, and we must have relied on him on at least 10 occasions. Best of all, the price is quite reasonable by Barcelona (and Europe) standards. We had a first-class experience without breaking the bank, leaving us to splurge on meals and entertainment that we may otherwise have not been able to afford.  Thumbs up.",5,2012,02,13
29,Elegant Old Hotel,"We stayed here for a few days before our cruise.  It is a lovely hotel, and the location is excellent too.  The only thing I can fault is the beds.  They were too firm for our family.  We had two rooms, and each of the rooms had a nice sitting area with a fireplace.  The breakfast was wonderful too, and we enjoyed meeting every evening in the comfortable hotel bar.  If you don't mind a rather hard bed, this is a good choice for Barcelona.",4,2012,02,11
29,A true classic jewel.,"We spent two nights at this palace last month. What a luxurious hotel!!!
Very well located, just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas.
The staff were helpful and very friendly.
We were upgraded to a junior suite (honeymoon trip), elegant and spacious.
They even gave us a bottle of Champagne, excellent detail.",5,2012,02,10
29,El Palace Hotel,"My husband and I are spending our last night at this beautiful hotel tonight and want to complement the entire staff and premises.  Celine, the manager, sought us out to introduce herself to us, and has been extremely courteous and friendly.  We were upgraded to a junior suite, which is most comfortable.  The recent renovations still give it the ""old world charm"" that we enjoy.  We also visited several other hotels while here, and realize that this one is superior!",5,2012,02,06
29,Great Hotel,"We've been threre at the end of January, everything was great, the hotel and the rooms are really well furnished and spotless.",5,2012,01,27
29,Wonderful hotel and great location,"We stayed at El Palace for a week in January and found this to be a luxurious hotel in a great location. The rooms were very spacious and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. We even had a huge walk in closet. I am so pleased that we chose this hotel over other options. The staff were friendly, helpful and quick to respond to our needs. My husband advised the hotel that we were celebrating my 60th birthday and retirement and on our arrival were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. When we return to Barcelona, we will definitley stay here again!",5,2012,01,14
29,A true palace.,"Only a few minutes walk form the main shopping street of Las Ramblas, this hotel shouldn't be described a hotel, it's more like stepping into a palace. We had a long 13 hour flight and all we wanted was to get to the hotel and do a bit of sightseeing. When we stepped in, your were greeted by a glistening chandelier, accompanied by two guards. The lounge was draped with green and purple hues and was the main highlight of the hotel. We actually got upgraded and we got a fabulous room. The room itself was elegant and very spacious with an oversized bath and rain shower. A definite choice in the heart of Barcelona!",5,2012,01,14
29,Superb Hotel,"This hotel is just superb, the decor and the staff are fantastic. The only snobbish chap was one on reception on the 7th Jan, the day of arrival who refused to accept our bed and breakfast booking because it was from some inferior travel-agent!! Apart from that we had a superb stay with breakfast not quite the 5 star rating.",5,2012,01,13
29,NIce hotel but not the best location,"We loved this hotel actually but we found it just a block or two too out of the main area. It was all within walking distance but after a long day, two blocks felt like more then that. I would stay here again but be more prepared for the location. There were always taxis outside and we got around ok.",4,2012,01,09
29,It is just perfect,"My wife and my 5 years old son we spent 6 nights at El Palace last week. The hotel is really luxury, very comfortable, with great taste and very efficiency. Everything happens when and how it should and you cannot fault the staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they will pamper you in a courteous but friendly and relaxed manner; you don't feel overwhelmed or patronised. The general atmosphere is superb and the food is outstanding. The location is also perfect",5,2012,01,09
29,Smells nice,"I posted my review previously, I was looking to find any similar smell that this hotel uses and I just found in Wal Mart this perfume (Paul Sebastian), almost the same smell El Palace uses in their rooms & facilities. :)",5,2012,01,08
29,"Amazing hotel, with great rooms in a very good location","Me, my wife and my parentes stayed @ El Palace during a car trip across Spain, France and Andorra. We stayed here in oct/11.
The hotel is just amazing, from the smell until the restaurants. We stayed here for 4 nights and had a pleasant time. They offer all you can expect from a member of the leading hotels of the world, from location to comfort, from service to good drinks.
The breakfast, asked at the room is very good, with different kind of breads, cheeses and ham, but the breakfast at the saloon was amazing. The saloon was beautiful, with plenty space between the tables. They have everything you need and much, much more.
The room was just great, we had a suite with sofa and a large bathroom, but with view to the internal patio.
The Bed was nice and large with a big screen tv and complimentary fresh fruits and spanish sparkling wine.
The bathroom was great, with plenty space, separate large rain shower and tub and separate toilet as well.
We tried the restaurant at the end of the lobby, at the main bar and the food was great, from the salad to pasta, everything very good and after the dinner we went to the downstairs bar and find a very nice small bar with a live pocket show where we had some good drinks with good music.
The only point is that sometimes you can listening the subway from some areas of the hotel, but nothing that will make your stay less pleasant.",5,2012,01,08
29,It was OK,"We booked a de-luxe double for 5 nights arriving on Christmas Day having been collected from the airport by the hotel car. On arrival we were upgraded to a 1st floor suite with an aspect looking out directly to rooms on the opposit site of former courtyard. To enable privacy, the windows were at least 80% opaque glass and with 3 sets of window dressings, natural light was seriously impeded. However as the weather was brilliant sunshine every day which  meant we were out all day we were not too bothered.  The room was well appointed with everything as it should be. The suite consisted of a bedroom, lounge, large bathroom with separate shower room and a luggage storage space.  The decent sized bedroom had  built in wardrobes, a wall-mounted flat screen TV and bedside tables.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a daily linen change. Lighting was excellent with a nightlight for in-bed reading in addition to lamps. The lounge contained a desk & chair, a sofa, armchairs and a 2nd wall-mounted TV. A mini-bar with limited stock is provided but no courtesy tray for hot drinks but this arrangement is fairly standard in Europe. I cannot function without tea as soon as my eyes are open so took my own travel kettle etc and this did not attract any comment (this has been known in other places but I like tea hot not tepid after a 10 minute journey from a kitchen!).Housekeeping and replenishment services were excellent given it was a holiday period for the local people as well.  

The bathroom offered a double wash basin unit with plenty of space for two sets of toiletries etc, a jacuzzi which worked and was spotless, a  large walk-in shower with the option of overhead or hand held waterflow. Only slight issue was the decor was very dark in the shower area but lighting and mirrors in the grooming area were excellent.

We took breakfast in a large room with central buffet tables.  This area is either a conservatory or is actually outside but cleverly disguised as an indoor room for winter months. It is heated by two types of heating -high wall-mounted electric bar heaters and moveable outdoor patio heaters. Despite their best efforts, these heaters are not adequate. As our visit progressed I was wearing more layers each morning and I observed other guests resorting to outdoor clothing at breakfast.  The food was fine but my other half felt that there should have been a cook to order menu for a hotel of this calibre. There was certainly no evidence of this being available. 

We had dinner in the AE restaurant on Christmas night which was absolutely fine but not exceptional. We also dined at their Michelin star restaurant Caelis and that's another story! Please see separate review. Suffice to say it was a week ago and we are still awestruck!!!

The location of El Palace is very central with excellent access to good shopping streets, a short distance to the Barrio Gotic, a healthy walk to beach and nearby the Gaudi hotspots. This was our 2nd visit to Barca and we still have not used a bus or underground train. Lots of people comment about noise from the underground. I noticed it but it was not obstrusive.  This is a city centre after all.

We tend to use 5 star hotels in cities and although El Palace does not equate to other places we have stayed in recent times it was very good value. We would probably give it another chance.",4,2012,01,05
29,Good but not great,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say that I don't think El Palace compares with some of the more famous five star hotels that I've stayed in (George V, The Hassler).

We were picked up by the hotel car and taken swiftly to the hotel, lead into reception and checked in(our room wasn't ready but it was 11.30 am) so we went to the restaurant to have lunch, it is decorated beautifully in keeping with the history of the building,they have done a great job sourcing beautiful reproduction furniture. We had lunch and it was fantastic but there was just no atmosphere, the place felt dead and we were the only people in it making it hard to sit back and relax.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was nice but just nice nothing amazing, the colours of the room were muted and the room felt dark and gloomy, the seating area only had one small sofa and two upright chairs so it wasn't a great place to lounge in. As it was our wedding anniversary my husband had (as a surprise) requested flowers, bubbly & cake in the room on arrival(he booked this two months in advance). They weren't there and when he tried to speak to reception got nowhere so he had to go downstairs and after a long conversation with them they explained they hadn't known if he wanted them on arrival or later in the day, its areas like this that they fall down in, a top 5 star hotel would do their utmost to make find out as it kind of ruined the surprise!

Other things such as a leaking radiator which had obviously been like it for some time as the carpet was discloured, not being able to get through to room service, a breakfast delivered without butter, salt, jam and milk and you can understand why I wasn't blown away.

The staff are friendly but they don't go out of their way to help, we had  drink each night when we returned from dinner and bang on 12 the bar was shut, we weren't asked if we would like another drink.....

We were on the 6th floor and you can here the metro, not enough to stop me sleeping but it's there.

We had dinner in their michelin star restaurant and I wasn't impressed with it (please see my seperate review), the breakfast was good, it's in a good spot, walking distance to the shops etc. It was a nice stay but nothing special and for the money I don't think we would return.",3,2012,01,04
29,Unique,"At 10 minutes walking distance from Las Rambas, you will find a pure gem. 
Everything in this Palace ( and it deserves the term of Palace ), is incredible : space, design, We felt like a royal couple in our room, the bathroom is huge. 
If you can afford it, just go for the Suite! 
What about service? Every staff is helpful and incredibly gentle whatever you ask for. 
I would definitely return and recommend this masterpiece.",5,2012,01,01
29,Amazing bathroom!,"Look at the pics - what a gorgeous place and the bathroom was as big as many of the hotel rooms I've stayed in!  Rooms were large by European standards, and the walk-in closet was fantastic.  Beautiful lobby, and the breakfast buffet was very satisfying.  Can't say how good the beds were because we were so jet-lagged we could have slept in the hallway.  Most European beds I found hard as a rock and I remember these as being close to that.  Very nice location -- close to lots of restaurants, bars, and shopping.  Only 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas.  The area felt very safe, even at night.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Obviously one of the best hotels in Barcelona.  Price was included in my travel package but I'm betting it was astronomical.  Stay here if you can afford to pay for first class accommodations -- you won't be disappointed.",5,2011,12,28
29,"A PALACE, NOT A HOTEL","We were blown away with HOTEL EL PALACE BARCELONA (OLD RITZ) - never in all our travels have we had such service from any hotel.   5 Star service in every way.  The hotel it self, is so beautiful that we were both blown away.  We received exactly what we have asked for, a quiet room, away from the elevators, top floor and received a free upgrade on top of it.  Free wi fi is available in the reception and lounge areas.    The restaurant;s breakfast is out of this world, the selection so fantastic and well presented.  
The room it self, comes with everything you need.  Do not expect a view if you want quietness, but this did not matter.  This hotel is close to everything you want to experience in Barcelona, on the Las Rambles, close to wonderful restaurantants, all the shops, pharmacies, hop on hop off bus routes, the squares, etc.
We are still blown away with this hotel and it staff - a must for every person who wants to stay in a beautiful 5 star hotel with good rates.
Thank you El Palace for making our stay in Barcelona unforgettable.",5,2011,12,23
29,a very well maintained hotel,"it's a grand hotel. straight away feel homey when entering the property. very clean and the room is very spacious. the breakfast variety is not as many compared to some big hotel but very good quality food. lots of variety of spanish ham, iberico. very tasty, it melts in your mouth. the apple turnover is the best yet tasted. we also dine in the cafetaria. the chef is michelin rated so the food is quite good with a reasonable price.",5,2011,12,22
29,"Elegant and comfortable, but a little noisy.","First the good, and it really is good: The hotel is elegant and comfortable; the staff are courteous and helpful; and everything is clean and works. The location, close to, but away from, the madding crowd, was perfect for us. The L'Occitane cosmetics are a nice touch. Style and pampering are words that come to mind. Of course, you get what you pay for, and it ain't cheap. We followed advice of previous reviewers and asked for the top floor and an internal room. The less than perfect are that their king-sized bed is really two twins (cleverly connected, but even so...), you can still hear and feel the metro even on the top floor (though it's not nearly as noticeable as in the lobby), we had no traffic noise - but plenty of noise from the airconditioning units on the roof (white noise, but still noise), and they charge for wi-fi in the room (though it's free in the lobby), which I find outrageous.",4,2011,12,19
29,El Palace - One of Barcelona's Best,"El Palace is a great place to stay in Barcelona if you are looking for luxury and a location within walking distance of museums, good restaurants, and shopping areas. I have stayed at this hotel perhaps four or five times during the last two years, and each visit has been consistently excellent. The hotel has been completely renovated, and the result is impressive. The rooms are spacious and luxurious with very comfortable beds. Some rooms have Roman baths. The junior suites have jacuzzi tubs and separate showers. A very good buffet is offered for breakfast. There is an informal restaurant available for lunch and dinner. The quality is good, but the restaurant is in an open setting next to the bar so there is not much atmosphere. I prefer to eat at one of the nearby restaurants. The hotel also has a Michelin starred restaurant (Caelis), and the food and service lives up to expectations. I would however suggest you eat elsewhere if you are looking for a lot of atmosphere or somewhere romantic, but this is just personal preference. Caelis would be a good place for a special business dinner as the tables are far apart, and it is quiet. (There is a good restaurant behind  El Palace called Casa Calvet. Favorites on trip advisor, Gelonch Restaurant and Osmosis Restaurant, are 10 and 20 min walks. Montrel is my favorite for food in Barcelona but it is a little further on foot or a 5 min taxi ride.) The only two small complaints I have with El Palace are that sometimes you can hear a slight rumble from the subway, and the noise of the rooftop ac units can be excessive in summer for some of the rooms. (Just ask for a room change if this bothers you.) Overall, El Palace is good value, and  hopefully you will not be disappointed. (Note that room prices can fluctuate significantly depending on what else is going on in Barcelona so rates can be very high at times.)",5,2011,12,18
29,Christmas Elegance,"We stayed here for two nights on a recent pre-Christmas break and really enjoyed the glamour and old fashioned style. Previously The Ritz (not sure if they still own it) it was refurbished four years ago. We stayed on the sixth floor in a room with a roman bath which was perfectly addictive. Breakfast was not to be missed in the covered courtyard. Staff and concierge were as to be expected, divine. It is well placed for shopping being just a stone's throw from Chanel, Louis Vuitton etc, but it's taxi ride for heel wearing ladies (or indeed men for that matter?!) if you want to have dinner in the Gothic Quarter.",5,2011,12,14
29,Elegance and Style in Barcelona,"For our first visit to Barcelona, having consulted all the usual sources, we chose the El Palace Hotel.  We knew from the moment we arrived at the entrance, we couldn't have made a better choice.  Well-located on a lovely boulevard and close to the Ramblas, this long-time Barcelona Ritz hotel has been beautifully up-dated on at least two occasions since it dropped the Ritz label in 1988. While the up-dating has incorporated all the modern conveniences, the decor is classic in style. The lobby, which incorporates a bar and a dining area at its far end, is huge and very elegant, with lovely sofas and magnificent chandeliers. The dining room for breakfast is reminiscent of a English garden room.  There is a Michelin-starred dining room which unfortunately we felt obliged to avoid, still suffering the effects of excessive eating during a just-completed Mediterranean cruise. We did, however, sample (and were happy with) the food and drink in both the less-formal dining area and the breakfast room. In summary, the public areas of the hotel are as good as they come.  Our room, on the top floor of the hotel, was of a good size and equally attractive and functional, with quality furnishings and a great bathroom including both a bath and separate shower. It's obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the planning as all one's needs seemed to be taken into account. The flat-screen television, for example, was incorporated into a mirror, so that one was unaware of a television in the room until it was activated with the remote control.  A very comfortable bed and quiet heating and airconditioning systems made sleeping very easy.  Of course, it is important also to have good staff.  From the doorman to the front desk to the chambermaid, every one we encountered was very professional, congenial and proficient in English.   We used to great advantage the very strong concierge desk in making arrangements for evening musical events and shopping recommendations. Yes, there were some minor concerns - if you didn't have (but require) an adapter for North American plugs, you have to ask for one; the standard bar of soap is hand-sized and not bath-sized, but the latter is available on request.  In short, this is a great hotel if elegance and style  and location are what you seek at a reasonable cost. We recommend it without reservation.",5,2011,12,09
29,The Royal Treatment,Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.  Can walk everywhere from this location.  The staff and service is amazing.  The rooms are so luxurious that it's hard to leave.  Can't wait to go back!,5,2011,12,09
29,Fantasic experience,"This hotel is aptly named.  It is a palace in all senses.  The restoration is a triumph.  We treated ourselves  to a Privilege Junior Suite (separate living and bedroom) and just loved the space.  The separate shower stall in the ultra-luxurious bathroom was out of this world! 
Everything was super-luxurious in this hotel.  The magnificent downstairs rooms are perfect for a drink, and the informative, friendly and professional barmen are first-class.

Breakfast in a magnificent glass-covered area produced the best buffet I have ever seen anywhere. 

A special word for the wonderful and friendly housekeepers: they kept our room spotless, and never intruded.

The location is perfect to see central Barcelona.  We also took the hop-on hop-off buses and saw all the sights.

We particularly appreciated the good tips of the concierge - they recommended excellent restaurants - as well as simple pizzerias when all we needed was a light meal. The people at Reception were efficient but disinterested. 

A superb experience.  Only draw-back: we did not meet one manager during our 4 night stay; even the most perfectly oiled machine needs a human face to represent it.  So Hotel Palace - put a duty manager on show and get him/her to say hello to the guests and show some warmth.",5,2011,11,29
29,Place of excellence,"Needless to say: this hotel looks amazing! The service goes with the looks - I found it exceptional. For me the style of the hotel is a bit too fancy as I like modern architecture but I admit that the harmony is perfect (even if the spa does not go with the interior of the hotel). Barcelona is a fascinating city, I enjoyed my stay.",5,2011,11,27
29,Wonderful stay at El Palace Hotel,"PERFECT LOCATION - 10-15 minutes by feet from every touristic point in Barcelona (passeig de gracia, barrio ghotico, ramblas, marina) 20min by feet from Sagrada familia, subway close to the hotel
5 STARS HOTEL - no doubt. It is actually the former Ritz hotel totally restored in 2008. The prices remain however (surprisingly) very reasonable. Very good surprise.
Restaurant / Breakfast : very good and reasonable prices given the quality
All the staff is very gentle and dedicated to the clients
Luxury Rooms",5,2011,11,23
29,Unforgettable Experience,"From personal experience, this hotel should be ranked as one the top three hotels in Barcelona. Once u put a foot there, u can see, sense and smell the touches of luxury and dedication. If u like classic design, then this is definitely the place to go, u can see it from the reception through the lobby, bar, terrace all the way to their incredible rooms. the service is outstanding, we arrive a few hours before our check-in time, and since the room was ready, we went to bar for a couple of drinks, then we were surprised by the hotels manager greeting us and apologizing for nothing they've done wrong, and putting our drinks on the house for three two days ""Unbelievable"". The room service is very fast and the food is extraordinary. and they have L'occitane products in the bathrooms. Highly recommended!!! cant wait to go back..",5,2011,11,22
29,Grand Old Hotel in a perfect location,"Hotel El Palace is in a perfect location - two blocks from the Passeig de Gracia, and within walking distance of the Barri Gotic and the center of historic Barcelona.  The public rooms are in a grand style from the turn of the 20th century, but the rooms are very comfortable and modern, with beautiful bath/dressing rooms - double sinks, separate rain shower stall and separate bathtub, and a private toilet.  Service was excellent and very friendly.",5,2011,11,20
29,Delighful!,"The first mention should go to the excellent staff, very attentive, knowledgeable, kind and truely interested in making your stay perfect. Had a great room on the second floor with a balcony over looking the side street,  Large room, fun TV in the 'mirror', no noise slept soundly.  Breakfast is good although the over head heaters very hot and asked to be seated away from them. The toaster provided was inadequate and took an age to toast the bread!",5,2011,11,20
29,A dream hotel,"A 5 star hotel with personal service, you feel very welcome from the moment you enter this impressive building. During the renovations every thing has been refurbished high class and high expense; every single details has been thought of (even the wonderful smell).",5,2011,11,20
29,"A nice hotel, close to everything.","This is a beautiful hotel with old world style and new world service.  The breakfast area was in a beautiful atrium with outdoor seating available.  The staff was very helpful. We also stayed there because we were told they had a remodeled gym in the hotel. It is a small, workout room and it may have been remodeled, but it only consists of two treadmills, two bikes and a small bright green bench. We affectionately called it a ""Barbie workout room.""  We would definitely stay here again.  It is so convenient to everything you would want to do in Barcelona.",5,2011,11,19
29,Most elegant and convenient place to stay,"Conveniently located to the Born, Gothic and La Ramblas, gorgeous interior and exterior (the old Ritz) , rooms were heavenly, loved the flat screen TV.  This is the only place to stay in Barcelona.  Fabulous daily breakfast buffet, best we've ever had!",5,2011,11,13
29,Ever Wonder What 5-Stars Smell Like?,"We went to El Palace as part of our Honeymoon. The hotel is located in a great area close to but not really in any specific area (about a 10 minute walk from the bus you can take from the airport and about 5 minutes from the closest Metro). This was our first '5-star' hotel and it did not disappoint. The rooms were large for European standards complete with a foyer, bathroom with separate tub and shower (with the rain-shower head), a large bedroom area and a walk-in closet bigger than the bathroom (you could easily sleep 2 kids or small adults in the closet). The entire place just smelled nice -- if you ever wondered what angel's tears smelled like it would probably be the scent in the halls (but less in the bedrooms) of the El Palace.
We had accidentally left our guidebook on the plane and so went directly to the concierge and asked what there was to do around town. Every person we spoke to at the concierge desk (there were a few that rotated depending on time of day) spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful and patient with us.
We had the buffet breakfast every day in the hotel which was situated in an outdoorish (part was actually open air and part had a semi-permanent canopy over top. The brunch was great and had alot of diversity with Spanish staples like sausages as well as an interesting Asian dim sum area. 
There was a club downstairs that we unfortunately never made it to as well as a spa in the hotel that we also never made it to. The Michelin Starred restaurant in the building looked great but had a lot of fois gras dishes which due to a strange twist in fate is the only food I'm actually allergic to so we did not try that either. 
Most people there were older than us (we're late 20s) and there were some kids ranging from around 5 up to teenage years. I got the impression we were there outside of tourist season (early October) and so the hotel wasn't packed. The entire time we wore Tshirts and jeans and not once did we get a disapproving look from the staff -- everyone was super friendly and most spoke at least English and Catalan if not Spanish and other languages as well (we heard German, French, and Mandarin from the guests in addition to English and Spanish). 
If you're looking for a beautiful hotel that clearly says 'old world charm' with a fantastic staff and a laid back but clearly 'expensive' vibe this is a great place. If you're looking for a trendy hotel right in the middle of the 'beautiful people' this is probably not the place for you. Equally good for couples and for families.",5,2011,11,13
29,A Very Wonderful  Experience,We stayed at this wonderful hotel to celebrating our 50th Anniversary.  What a wonderful choice.  It is in the perfect location.  We were walking distance to all the sources of Barcelona.  I can't wait to to back again..  It is truly a BEAUTIFUL PLACE.  The Hotel itself was just like being in a castle.  I felt like a Queen!,5,2011,11,10

Add to that the staff, which consistently goes above and beyond, is the very best of any hotel I've stayed at in the world.  I sharedwithnthem this was our 25th anniversary and they upgraded us at no extra charged to a Junior Suite and sent a bottle of great Cava to our room.  What a great way to start our vacation and celebration.  Thanks to everyone at the Palace and we'll see you again soon!",5,2011,11,06

The rooms are gorgeous and luxurios with huge bathroom and double sink. The hotel is tucked away off of the shopping strip but was within easy walking distance of all the sites including La ramblas & Sagrada Família, seeing lots of others on the way. Loved this hotel and not only would recommend but can not wait to return! Beautiful city, people, food and hotel.",5,2011,11,03
29,Wonderful Stay!,"My husband and I  recently returned from a 7 night stay at the Palace.  The hotel, formerly known as the Ritz, was closed for two years to undergo a renovation that is now completed. This is indeed a 5 star hotel--excellent location! We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to anyone. The Trip Advisor advice to request a high floor away from the lift resulted in us having a room on the top floor with a small balcony---perfect!  The rooms have sound proof windows and room darkening shades but we never found the street noise to be a bother.  The bathrooms are lovely with separate shower/tub and a separate room for the toliet. Bathrobes and slippers are provided. Beds are very comfortable.We had a classic deluxe double with an additional twin bed for our 20 year old son.  Housekeeping services were excellent.
 The public rooms are old world European, very elegant.  The staff was gracious ,friendly and very competent.  The concierge was able to arrange futbol tickets to see Team Barcelona while we were there. They also helped with tickets to a flamenco performance and train tickets to Figures--home of the Salvador Dali museum.  
We had breakfast in the Garden Room twice---pricey but lovely. We also had cocktails in the bar area and also dinner at the hotel one evening--just wonderful.  There is a late night lounge with live music in the basement that had fabulous drinks, great bartenders and was a fun way to end a long day of touring.  
I would recommend the hotel and the city of Barcelona to anyone!  We had a great time!",5,2011,10,29
29,Fabulous hotel,"El Palace made our stay in Barcelona very special. The service, rooms, location were all excellent. The concierge desk were tremendously helpful. The complimentary breakfast was the best we have had in Europe, served in a magnificent outdoor/indoor space with warm heaters for a chilly morning. This hotel was once a Ritz Hotel and it has all the amenities of a Ritz. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip back to Barcelona.",5,2011,10,25
29,Esplèndid,"Where does one start? Upon arrival we were welcomed by David, the wonderful Concierge. He looked after us from the moment we arrived offering advice on what to see, where to go and what to look out for. 
The room was exquisite, the bed extremely comfortable and therapeutic, the bathroom spacious and luxuriously fitted out including a ceiling shower outlet which massages the whole body. Upon entering the room there is no television visible, but alas.....it is cleverly disguised as a wall mirror.
We had dinner in the restaurant...excellent and had breakfast in the warm & picturesque courtyard area at the rear which was even better.
The fittings, fixtures and chandeliers of the foyer/public area ooze opulence.
The only regret we have is that we only stayed there one night.
A definite hotel to be shortlisted if contemplating a stay in beautiful Barcelona.",5,2011,10,25
29,Grand & Luxurious!!,"My husband & I stayed at this amazing hotel after disembarking from a Mediterranean Cruise and we were more than impressed with El Palace! The hotel is very elegant and the decor is sumptuous and lavish. 

The service is exceptional - from the door man to the Reception Desk to all the staff, the service is faultless. 

The room was very beautiful, the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom was splendid! We were also very happy with our breakfasts and dinner - impeccably prepared and very tasty!
The location is very good - central to all the amazing sites of Barcelona.

Really, there nothing negative we could say about El Palace - we will have no hesitation in recommending this opulent and refined establishment and look forward to returning to El Palace in the future!",5,2011,10,23
29,Great hotel and very friendly staff. I only wish if the provided tea maker in the room.,"Found the hotel very good. Rooms are very spacious. Location is great as it's away from the hustle bustle but still within walking distance from all heart of the city.

A bit expensive. The only criticism I have is that there was no water kettle or coffee in the room. I would expect such a hotel to have this in the room. ",4,2011,10,22
29,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"My husband and I stayed at El Palace for three nights in early October.  We chose this hotel for its proximity to our daughter's apartment (she is studying in Barca for the semester).  We went into it having read all the reviews on TripAdvisor so we were prepared for the train vibration.  The hotel is very formal and grand.  The bar/salon area is beautiful and we enjoyed a nice afternoon snack and drinks there one afternoon.  Our room was on the 4th floor and spacious, with a separate sitting area with a desk, couch and TV.  The bathroom was quite large with a shower, double sink and tub.  The tub was very modern with many settings for a wonderful spa experience.  The gym was too small for my husband and not much choice of equipment.  The service at every point was great, from the bellman, Norman, who showed us to our room to the maids who came in twice daily and did a great job.  The front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, except I always seem to have trouble with restaurant recommendations from the staff at high-end hotels.  I can never get a good, local, inexpensive name from them.  They always want to send us to expensive touristy spots no matter how much I ask them not to. They sent us to La Gavina on the waterfront.  The food was not good and the prices were high.  Don't go there!  Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at El Palace.  As long as you can get over feeling the floor vibrate every once in a while, you will enjoy this hotel.",4,2011,10,16
29,1st anniversary break,excellent standard of hotel. Spacious rooms. Breakfast and service amazing.,5,2011,10,14
29,Great location in busy Barcelona,"Room lived up to its 5* rating and was quiet even though I was on the 6th floor at the front of the hotel facing the busy intersection.  Walking distance to most of the sights yet away from the madding crowds.

They have a wonderful Michelin chef in residence which was surprising empty the night i dined. Well worth having the dinner there - ambiance was in the beautifully renovated former ballroom and the presentation and taste of the food was titillating and delightful.

I will definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2011,10,14
29,El Palace Hotel,"We stayed at El Palace for a couple of nights before our cruise this year.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We loved the location as we were able to walk to most places.  The service was excellent and the room very comfortable and clean.  While they did charge for Wireless access, they do have computers in the business area off the lobby that one can use for free.  We are planning to return next year.  While we did hear the noise from the subway, it didn't disturb our sleep.",5,2011,10,08
29,A place for Kings!,"The El Palace in Barcelona is a beautiful hotel recently renovated. It is right in the heart of the Catolonia area. Although located on a major high street, once inside its very quite. I did not experience any of the noise some recent reviewers complained about rather my sleep was blissfull. While the service was excellent and the hotel luxurious, you sort of get a sense that this place is more suited for the retired, elderly crowd. However, if i ever return to barcelona i will certainly stay at the El Palace!",4,2011,10,08
29,Too much noise,"The noise began at 4 or 5 in the morning, we believe it was either the subway or  the elevators... Although I sleep well like a rock, this intermitent noise disturbed mine and my husband´s sleep. This noise ocurred in intervals of 10-15 minutes. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a hard time sleeping. Unfortunately this noise obscured our stay.",2,2011,10,03
29,Do not stay here if you want to get any sleep..,"Elegant, luxurious hotel with beautiful, spacious rooms.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Very expensive drinks in the bar downstairs but the live music was good. I ordered the club sandwich at the bar and it was good, so were the fries that came with it. The temperature in the shower alternated between scalding hot and cold. I spilled water on the bathroom floor. After I wiped it up, the towel was covered with dirt and long hairs from the previous guest. 

The noise and vibration from the train were unbearable. I didn't get any sleep my first night as a result of it.  I was on the 2nd floor initially but requested to be moved to the 6th floor.  The noise and vibration weren't as bad there but my sleep was still disrupted. 

El Palace is nice, elegant, and in a great location, but the noise and vibration made it impossible for me to sleep peacefully, and I'm not a light sleeper. I wouldn't stay here again even if it was free.",2,2011,09,25
29,Luxurious,"This trip was to celebrate my hubby's 60th birthday and he loves Barcelona.  So I planned a cruise out of Barcelona with an extended stay pre cruise in Barcelona one of his favorite cities.  Had never stayed at the El Palace before but having read the recommendations and seeing our cruise critic friends were staying there.  I booked.  I was not disappointed.  Excellent service and luxurious accomodations.  Front desk who keep your key with a tassle on it for you like in the old days.  Willing to exchange some euros for smaller bills for you.  A charming little bar in the lower level which is a well kept secret and had live entertainment that we enjoyed.  A great breakfast in the conservatory--buffet and wide selections.  Beautiful lounges.  Room with the tv in the picture frame above the fireplace.  We were on the 4th floor and the only negative I could say and it really did not bother me too badly.....as we were jetlagged and messed up on sleeping times....I heard the metro down below rumble by in the night....and I reminded myself I was not sleeping well due to jetlag and time dif and we were in a large city and went back to sleep...got used to it.  Bathroom and amenities were great, bed was comfortable, there were chairs and a desk too.  Close to a little grocery store in case you want to get picnic fixins and wine too.  Also, close to the Gaudi sites which is another great reason to stay there...walkable....and a nice tapas bar in the next block.  I would stay there again with no hesitation.",5,2011,09,25
29,Another world....,"The Doorman was appalled that I opened the front door myself and slipped inside unassisted. Another guest was standing in the opulent foyer, looking very much a ""Camilla look-alike"" I was looking around for ""Charles"". This hotel is everything you would expect of a Palace. Grand in style, abundant in offerings. Clean and well appointed, the room was large, lavish and very comfortable. I did hear the trains, but a mere distant rumbling and not at all annoying, the main train station is just two blocks away. I had lashed out on something special for my last night in Barcelona, and was not disappointed. I had breakfast at the city markets so can't comment on their dining services, I can only imagine they are in keeping with the rest of this hotel and are of an acceptable standard. It was fun to stay in this rather ""royal"" style of hotel.",3,2011,09,23
29,"Traditional, beautiful hotel, right in the centre","Me and my husband stayed at the El Palace hotel in Barcelona this summer for 2 nights. We had received a very nice upgrade and the room was beautiful. 
The service was good, the hotel renovated, old luxury, and impressive. 
I found the breakfast to be good, but  not the best I have had in 5 star hotels. There is a great bar in the hotel, where they serve cocktails and where time has stood still, very nice!
They had a good housekeeping service, we always found our room clean and good turn down service. 
It's well positioned, in the city centre.",5,2011,09,20
29,Almost faultless stay,"After an 11 day holiday covering Florence and Venice my Wife and I stayed here for two nights en route to our home in Spain. This is an exceptionally good hotel, well situated and with excellent service. The noise from the trains was minimal but we were on the top floor. The only problem was with housekeeping but this was soon resolved. Staff very helpful and accommodating. Would recommend and certain to stay again.",5,2011,09,19
29,Mixed,"El Palace is in a good location, roughly between La Rambla and Gaudi's Sacrada Familia. Breakfasts are better value than you may think. A basket of croissants, bread rolls, danish pastries and pain au chocolat is 14 euros and perfect for 2 people (one each of all above) Beer in the hotel is the cheapest drink at 7 euros and is served with complimentary cheese straws, crisps and nuts. The house keeping is adequate but they should clean all blankets and bed spreads after each guest if possible to avoid what happened to me, a stained blanket. Mini-Bar prices are as you would expect but 5 euros for 0.5 litre bottles of water is more expensive than it should be for such a basic necessity. The concierge was average, nowhere near as useful as the tourist information office situated near Gaudi's La Pedrera.
Overall, I found Barcelona worth seeing. It has good transport and walking around is pretty easy but I got irritated at the lack of information in Castellano and of how all plays etc are in Catalan. If you want to be in the best areas, check out the Starbucks, they are well located.",3,2011,09,16
29,Nice hotel - convenient location,"The hotel is nice and well located. Close to Gaudi famous places: Casa Mila, Casa Batlo. Walking distance to the Ramblas. The hotel has been restored nicely. The lobby and the breakfast room are beautiful. Our rooms both Junior Suite had nice bathroom but not great view. Staff is pleasant. Breakfast nice. My only regret: no swimming pool. However, I will come back to Palace hotel.",4,2011,09,12
29,Excellence!,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location.  The rooms and large, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are very large and modern.  Service was excellent.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,09,12
29,"Best Staff, Old World Ambience","My 24 year old daughter and I just did a mother daughter trip and stayed at El Palace Hotel. The Staff was very helpful(Concierge were great) and the service was top notch, Our room which was a junior suite was exquisite, everything down to the nightly turn down service to the quality of the linens. Everyone spoke English and being from the States I felt at home there. The one major issue I had was the constant subway noise that seemed to run under the hotel. It disturbed our sleep and I found it very unpleasant.We had room 126, so I would not suggest that particular room. we also heard the room service bell constantly as we were next to the butler's pantry.",4,2011,09,11
29,Wonderful Hotel,"I was shifted from Rey Juan Carlos I Hotel to El Palace due to electrical difficulties as the receptionist told me!
Regardless the train little sounds ,and the internet way of serving, El Palace experience was totally great experience",5,2011,09,11
29,Elegant Rooms and Gracious Service,"I loved this hotel. It has such an old-world feel and the service is impeccable. Here, the doorman smiles, and the beds are always turned down for the evening. The room is gorgeous and the bathrooms are very nice. It's just like the photos. As a lovely surprise, we received a complementary bottle of cava for our anniversary. This hotel was near enough to the sights, so we always walked to the Gothic quarter, the Borne neighborhood, and Passig de Gracia.

I am a spa-junkie and I had the most FABULOUS deep-tissue massage and facial at the Mayan Luxury Spa. It's not large by any means. You won't find pools and jaccuzies and their locker room is tiny. But what you will find is a very professional service and what they do is fantastic. I started off in their sauna, and the day just melted away. I was so tired from running from one Barcelona attraction to the other, that I needed this time for myself. It was so nice.. and quiet. Candles and lavendar smells. After my services, I was offered tea and fruit on their daybed. This experience definately exceeded my expectations. Husbands and boyfriends.. if you are reading.. surprise your ladies.

Some negatives- Honestly, yes, you hear the rumble. We stayed on the 6th floor and we heard it. I don't think it was that bad, but I feel like it's a shame that this hotel has that problem. It's worse on the first floor. At the spa, during the service, I didn't hear it.. but I think I was really enjoying myself. I don't really know what the timings are for it.. but it seems very random to me. Another negative.. sometimes.. the water switches temperatures.. hot to cold.. but it corrects itself soon enough. Third negative.. though maybe not entirely their fault.. It's a European hotel, so it has European beds.. which means they have double hard/firm beds. However, they do not have European rooms.. because we thought our standard room was huge!

Overall, fantastic stay.. some misses.. but I would stay here again.",4,2011,09,09
29,Lovely Hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed here for one night prior to embarking on a cruise out of Barcelona.  The hotel is absolutely gorgeous inside and smells wonderful.  Gracious porters took our luggage from the cabs and stored them as our room was not ready until a few hours later.  Helpful front desk personnel gave us maps and suggestions for where to eat and shop.

The hotel is very centrally located and walking to tour buses, restaurants and stores can be done within 20 minutes.  

Rooms were immaculate and well appointed.  We had a king size bed and a roll away cot was brought in for our son.  He did not find it very comfortable and ended up sharing our bed in the wee morning hours!

Great restaurant and bar off the central lobby.  A buffet breakfast is offered in addition to a la carte menu items which included both American and Spanish breakfast foods.  Coffee was delicioso!  Service was great.

In the evening we enjoyed cocktails and little nibbles while reclining on comfortable sofas and chairs in the lounge.",5,2011,09,08
29,Pure Luxury !,"We stayed here for just four nights and loved it.  The hotel is well situated within walking distance of shopping and the Old Town.  There are some small restaurants/bars nearby too.

The room we had has beautiful and the bathroom had a massive shower and a sunken Roman bath.

Breakfast was to die for !  I don't think I've ever seen such a selection before, and if you want something different, just ask.  The Hotel caters for all nationalities.

The staff very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely go back.",5,2011,09,02
29,Wonderful Hotel,"We had the delight of staying in this hotel just as they were completing the renovations.  We were not able enjoy the Bar downstairs that had a grand piano and beautiful antique brass coffee machine as the paint was still drying! However I did get to see where the athletic room with pool will be located in the future.  The staff was attentive and able to answer questions and give suggestions. the location was righ in the center of everything,  We walked a couple short blocks to eat Tapas and take tour buses.  The concierge gave wonderful recommendations and when we decided to rent a car they had one available right at the hotel all taken care of...it was a brand new Mini",5,2011,09,01
29,Luxury and top-notch service,"My wife and I spent 3 nights here in July while celebrating our anniversary - decided to splurge a bit on a nice hotel.  This hotel is absolutely beautiful, with a turn-back-the-clock plush feel.  From the moment walked in the door we were treated like royalty.  We made a passing reference to the recent Wimbledon final and the front desk clerk - unsure of the outcome - called a concierge who ran over to fill us in on the details.  This set the tone for the rest of our stay...the staff was always willing to go the extra mile.

The room was very nice with a spacious sitting area and massive bathroom - which was actually split into two separate rooms - one for the shower and one for the toilet.  Bed was comfortable.  Nice bathrobes.  High end toiletrees.  Just an all around luxury experience.

The location is also quite good.  The Ramblas is a short walk away and the tony Eixample neighborhood - home to many Gaudi houses - is also very close.

If this hotel is within your budget, you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here.",5,2011,08,30
29,Lovely hotel in a great location,"My husband and I stayed here before and after our Mediterranean cruise and loved this hotel.  Everyone, from the doorman to the concierge to the housekeeping staff, was amazing.  A wonderful smell permeated the common areas and the facility was very clean.  The bathroom was beautiful and modern and the television was IN the mirror over the fireplace. The hotel offers turndown service and free wi-fi, but there's a catch.  You must request a login from the front desk and it's good for only 1 hour per day.  I've read that the hotel offers shuttle service to the airport and cruise terminal, but neither of these proved true.  Still, the hotel was great and in a great location.  We were two blocks from Las Ramblas and did lots of walking!  There are also two metro stops within walking distance of the hotel, making it easy to navigate the city.

An added bonus is that we arrived in Barcelona at 8:30am and were relieved to find that our room was ready and available for a nap after a long international flight.  However this spoiled us because after our cruise returned to Barcelona we were expecting the same grace but found that the hotel was completely booked (9 cruises were coming and going that day) and had to wait from 8am until 2pm to get our room).",5,2011,08,26
29,unlimited member LHW a PARIA !!!!,"I was in Barcelona in August with my wife and 2 years baby, first I stay to the W Barcelona who is a nice hotel but not for little children's and for that I move to the EL PALACE ex Ritz, when I arrive to the hotel the doormen receive us with a face like he stay and wait us over the schedule job, but that was ok until I arrive to the reception where I was present to a gentlemen, very probably  ex employee of Ritz, arrogant, aristocratic type that begin by explain me even I am an unlimited member of LHW and I book a roman bath room and I have automate upgrade is better for me to stay in my room and Yes is truth that I have breakfast free, BUT only in my room otherwise I have to pay if I want to see people (I THINK THAT LHW HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE WITH THIS HOTEL THAT ISSUE)...I don't say anything but I can' t not believe what's happen to me, I ask to see anyway the upgrade room... was the little's junior suite in my life and the darkness one. I say if he can't make my a double upgrade and his answer was :""NEVER A LHW MEMBER WILL HAVE A SUITE!!!"" ....In this case I accept the room initially booked and right away I write a mail to lhw client support.
  Next morning in the lobby I was attended by the MANAGER... ( I don't know what LHW do but they are great) who tell me he love his job and he fell really sorry for his employ misstake and if I agree he will change my room to the Dali Suite (the best in hotel) I decline his offer because the second day a leave anyway the hotel and in this case he offer me the same deal for a further stay in hotel and also a botlle of champagne in the room.",1,2011,08,24
29,Nice,"I stayed at this hotel at the beggining of the year and it was very good.
It is all renovated and so comfortable - and I was in the smallest room! Also very classy, old style class
Room: clean, spacious, beautiful decoration
Bathroom: stylish, clean
Breaskfast was fantastic (great variaty) ! -  and in a really nice place
Staff was kind and always there when you needed. 
Location: good but not great - near to a lot of touristic sites, but not so close either (walk to Las Ramblas takes around 15 mins).
My only issues: 1) shower - it really changed temperature - boiling water to cold in seconds- and vice-versa in the middle of your shower! I hope they fixed it 2) train (?) noise :  I think it was the train, or subway, and it went on day and night. Nothing too bad (but I was in 5th floor)",4,2011,08,23
29,Fabulous Stay Truly 5 Star!!!,"After staying at two other supposedly 5 Star hotels on my trip one being a new hotel and one modern I decided to go with something traditional and it worked. I was doing this part of my trip alone so I wanted to feel safe and I did. From entering the hotel to the day I left I was treated like a queen (albeit was August and not very busy, Barcelona residents leave town in August). The concierge team were my saving grace can't thank them enough. The maids were like little fairies, so quiet and discreet. The rooms were lovely although one complaint I had was the location of the TV it was on the side not in front of the bed but this is minor and only my personal preference.
I was on the top floor and did hear the train but it was pretty distant and I got used to it after one night. Not sure how noisy it would be on the first floor? I did like the Gothic, Born area of the cIty  for its bars and narrow streets but I heard that this was sometimes a little unsafe. 
I must also commend the beautiful lady who greeted me as I arrived and was constantly 'there'. She was so gracious and professional  I think her name was Christine but I may be wrong anyway she was the best.
All in all a truly 5 or 6 star experience, very rare in this day and age even at the most expensive hotels. Well worth it!!!",5,2011,08,18
29,"No Doubt, The Palace is the Palace","I had the chance to stay at El Palace last July. it has been from the beginning to the end a real luxury and personalized experience that few hotel in the world can offer to the guest. The welcoming smile and the generosity, humility and kindness of the staff warm my heart. 
The attention paid to details of the entire hotel, the rooms are absolutely top notch and immaculate. 
The restaurant, DO NOT MISS the gastronomic restaurant Caelis which has been a truly moment of pure sensation with the product and the style of the cuisine. Everything has been so well organized for me and my guest, thanks to two person who are a real plus in the staff and know what is the meaning of luxury service. POR FAVOR,  ask for Katharina and Celine to have a memorable stay at the Palace and to feel the proper way of Barcelona. 
One point missing at the hotel, a swimming pool, but the hotel is not so far from the see.",5,2011,08,18
29,As Advertised,"What you see on their website is what you get. Great location, great restaurant and bar, and very helpful and friendly service. The bed was a little too firm for my liking, but I would recommend to friends and family.",5,2011,08,16
29,Grand old hotel with impeccable character,Spent 4 nights here last week. Room was high and very quiet. Staff excellent and very attentive. Can find no faults whatsoever. It's not cheap but definitely worth splurging out for. The breakfasts are excellent. 2 blocks from Las Ramblas. All in all had a enjoyable stay at the hotel.,5,2011,08,12
29,Great hotel !!,"We stayed at the Palace for 5 nights in July and had a wondersful time.  The hotel is gorgeous, the staff exceptional, and the room lovely.  There are two very good restaurants in the hotel and many more within walking distance.  A short walk to Las Ramblas for great people watching, eating, and starting hop on, hop off bus tours.",5,2011,08,12
29,What an amazing hotel; incredible service,"After returning from our cruise we had one more night in Barcelona before flying back to the states. We arrived at the hotel around 9am and they gave us a room immediately. It was clear they went out of their way to find us an available room.  The rooms was awesome, and the service Ritz Carlton quality.  Beautiful living room with quaint bar.  First class breakfast buffet next morning included in the room price was served in their atrium. Really beautiful, great service, delicious. There are many less expensive hotels, but if you are looking for high end or want to splurge you will not be disappointed.",5,2011,08,11
29,Best hotel in Barcelona,We were at your palace for one night prior to a cruise. It was gorgeous and the staff was beautiul. We will be back!,5,2011,08,10
29,Great for Business and Fun,"Very nice hotel.  Great staff, even though the front desk was a little indifferent at times. The rooms were wonderful.  Nice, clean, big, modern...really as nice as it can get in a big city European Hotel. The bathrooms were awesome.
The locations is really ideal.  Close to everything. easy walk, or easy cab ride to every where you want to go.
The bar upstairs was good. The bar downstairs was amazing.  live music, great bar tender.  We went downstairs every night we were there.
Hard to find much to complain about.",4,2011,08,08
29,A+++++,"We stayed at this hotel in July 2011 and it was great, the rooms were lovely and the breakfasts are terrific.  The ambience was elegant and  its decoration reminds the Hermitage Hotel in Montecarlo
The staff could not be more helpful, especially Michael & Norman. We don’t need our hand holding and a perfect service all the time, but every employee gave it to us in this hotel.
Our only slight problem was that our final day. It took two pone calls and 15mins to get ice.

But anyway that’s a really 5 stars hotel. 
A+++++",5,2011,08,06
29,I honestly have to say that this is by far one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world. All modern and fancy and great service. This hotel is the old Ritz! Renovated. But still in keeping with the period furniture and brass railing on the stairs. The large swag drapes. Opulence from the 15-15th century with guilded furniture. If you like that, then this is the place for you. The staff was fabulous. And let me tell you I am fussy. We were served comp. champagne when we arrinved. Exactly what I needed! We I can keep going but no need. You get the idea. 
Oh its close to everything. High end shopping and  the Ramblas, which is a fantastic shopping, eating, enterntainment marquise of Barcelona. A must see.",5,2011,08,05
29,El Palace - very nice place to stay,"We enjoyed our stay in El Palace a lot. Room was neat and quite spacious. The location superb. Just couple of blocks from Catalunia square, Rambla and Pacei dei Gracia. The service was very good. Michelin star restaurant - outstanding food and good vine selection. The only thing which we didin't like - the metro beneath. You could feel the trains passing by, despite the fact that we were on the 4th floor. It was not bad, but for such a hotel it was a minus. Part from that - everything was perfect and we will gladly stay there once again.",5,2011,08,01
29,"Beautiful Hotel, Good Location in Barcelona","My wife, son, and I stayed here after our cruise for a few days.  It is a beautiful hotel with a very nice staff.  I liked that there were good restaurants nearby.  We had a junior suite and it was very nice.  Be sure to check the bar out downstairs, it is very cool with all the woodwork and just a neat setting.  We were here on a Sunday and had the brunch at the hotel restaurant which is in an outdoor courtyard.  It is beautiful the way they have it set up.  Before our cruise, we stayed at Le Meridien near La Ramblas, and it was nice but much more expensive and I thought El Palace had more class.",5,2011,07,27
29,An elegant and peaceful hotel in the middle of Barcelona,"I chose this hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor - I was not disappointed and most of the reviews were accurate. I did not give the hotel 5 stars because of 2 things - the constant (but not too loud) noise from the underground Metro line, and the way that wireless internet is handled. If you want ""free WiFi"" - you have to go down to the hall or business center (which are very beautiful and comfortable), then ask the front desk for a ""code"" which allows you to use the WiFi for 1 hr - then if you need more time, you must go back to the counter and ask for another one. For a hotel of this caliber, they should understand that their guests want absolute comfort, privacy and convenience without being ""nickled and dimed"". If you want to stay in your room - no problem, it's just an extra 15 Euro/day for WiFi.
Those are my only (small) complaints. The hotel is beautiful, the location is great - most of the sightseeing is easily within walking distance. The staff was outstanding and very pleasant.
I would recommend this hotel to couples, families and singles for short stays in Barcelona.",4,2011,07,27
29,Luxury and personal service,"Everything about El Palace is 5 star. What makes it stand out from other similar hotels is the level of service and the staff who seem genuinely happy to have you as their guests. While unquestionably elegant and  luxurious, the ambience and warmth in this former Ritz hotel is more that of a boutique establishment  We were personally welcomed and later farewelled by the guest manager who was keen to have feedback on our 3 night stay. The recently opened Mayan Spa is amazing, and VIP treatment is assuredl. Of course we'll return!",5,2011,07,23
29,Elegant and great service,Large rooms and bathrooms. Very clean. Great service. Turn down service with dark chocolates every night was a plus for me!,5,2011,07,20
29,"Absolutely Perfect""","From the minute we stepped into the hotel, which was very early on a holiday morning, we were treated famously.  Despite the early hour (9 AM) the staff was able to get a room ready for us and from there we were able to start our day touring in Barcelona.  The breakfast room was magnificent with great choices and excellent service.  The hotel itself is old world beautiful, the rooms are spacious and quiet (the subway underneath is really not an issue, don't let that bother you).  The bathrooms are magnificent with rain drop showers and whirlpool baths.  Service- outstanding, whatever you wanted was there in minutes.  The concierges were very courteous and helpful.  One of the best  hotels we have ever stayed in. Centrally located, can walk to many attractions and the harbor. Expensive but worth every penny!!",5,2011,07,14
29,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff!","Stayed here in early July and would heartily recommend it to everyone.  Pricey, but definitely worth it.  The hotel is first class and the staff are so helpful and friendly.  Ask for Alexis in customer service....he is a great resource in helping with tours, sight seeing and restaurants.  Loved every minute of our stay here!

You do hear the vibrations from the nearby metro, but it is really no big deal.  It would be nice if wifi was available in the rooms as well, but again, not a big deal, as internet is available in the business center.",5,2011,07,14
29,lives up to its rep,"Arrived exhausted after a night flight from NY.  The initial reception was a bit cool, as there was discrepancy over the date we were to check out.  Rather than accept that I had reserved for 3 nights rather than 4, the desk attendant proceded to pull out a book of all correspondence and communication we had exchanged, apparently in an attempt to prove me wrong.  No big deal, but certainly not an embrace of ""the customer is always right"" philosophy.

After that shaky start all was wonderful.  Javier showed us to our lovely room on the fourth floor and explained the workings of the room and its features with wit and grace, and he had a cheery greeting whenever we saw him during our stay.  Room furnishings and the bath were not ""showy"" but definitely of a 5 star calibre.  Can't imagine that the minor rumbling of the metro beneath the hotel could annoy anyone but the most finicky traveller.  For us it was a non-issue. 

Hallways are wide and bright.  The lobby is magnificent as is the breakfast terrace (although breakfast prices seem unreasonably high.)  There is a bar at the rear of the lobby, but it is very quiet, and there is actually only table seating.....no bar stools.   The place to go for more action is the scotch bar, down a staircase from the lobby.  This relatively small room features a proper bar, 2 attentive and amusing bartenders, and live entertainment in the evenings until 2 a.m.  Even the size of the pours seems more generous than the usually stingy European style.  HIghly recommend a visit or two downstairs.

The hotel is in a lovely residential neighborhood that's an easy morning stroll to several breakfast options, as well as restaurants for lunch and dinner.  The major sites and shopping are also walkable or an easy cab ride.  (Concierge service is great.  There seemed always to be at least 3 or 4 on duty, and they arranged for a perfect private walking tour our first day in town.)

Were originally scheduled to stay at the Mandarin Oriental but decided on a more Old World experience.  After checking out the MO on the busy Passeig de Gracia I'm convinced we made the absolute right decision.",5,2011,07,08
29,superb hotel,"We stayed at El Palace for three nights in a junior suite.It is undoubtedly one of the best hotels we have stayed in Europe.
The staff are professional and friendly .Nothing is too much trouble,Breakfast is superb in a magnificent setting.
The bar downstairs off the lobby is really something after about 11 P.M.
We would go back anytime.It is a really good experience.Hotels like El Palce are very difficult to find.",4,2011,07,08
29,Loved This Hotel and Barcelona.  They made our stay Perfect!!,"My boyfriend and I spent 3-/12 days at the El Palace Hotel before departing on a cruise.  This hotel did not disappoint!!!  We had an early flight into Barcelona and as soon as we arrived at the hotel, the staff advised that they had held a room for us so we could get comfortable right away.  Both of us I were blown away by the staff and attention to detail at this hotel.  Nothing was overlooked.   When I inquired at 10 p.m., before leaving for dinner, if we could possibly get additional pillows for our room the next day, the gentlemen immediately informed me that the pillows would be in our room upon our return that evening.  His response was ""we are a 24 hour hotel, just let us know what and when you need something and we'll take care of it"".  Impressive!    The room was a very nice size, not huge but definitely big enough for two.  The bed was super comfortable and the room was extremely clean.  Our room was cleaned every day and turned down even if we left twice in one evening.  They didn't miss a detail!

Our room at the front of the hotel on the third floor overlooked the lovely boulevard and statue.  The bath was beyond huge and was separated by a hallway with another door for extreme privacy.  We could practically swim in the mosaic tub.  We felt as if we had checked into a beautiful spa when going into the bath.  The huge glassed in shower is separate from the tub and has a waterfall shower head directly from the ceiling.  Felt so great, we never wanted to leave the bath!!   From the third floor I have to admit you can hear and feel the rumble of the subway.  It never bothered my boyfriend but it took me a day to get used to it.  If you are bothered by noise and some light shaking, this aspect will annoy you.  Also, the breakfast is very expensive.  We had a continental breakfast included with our room.  I ordered cereal and fresh fruit once and it was $22 Ouch!  But there are option!   One morning I walked across the street to the market picked up some fresh fruit and yogurt for about 3 Euro.  There are many little restaurants close to the hotel so that is also a great option.  I definitely would not let this aspect deter you as there are tons of options for breakfast and the hotel is just too fantastic to let those little issue scare you away.  Also, buy bottles of water from the market across the street.  To exchange money, there is also a bank directly across the street.  Bring your passport!

I did want  to eat in their beautiful restaurant downstairs but couldn't justify the prices of an additional $20 per person or $40 per day.  Perhaps if we stayed a week, we would have experienced it but there was just so much to do and see!

Barcelona is a vibrant, exciting city with so much to do during the day and a place where the city really gets going around 9 or 10 p.m. for dinner.   We loved this aspect of the city.  You don't have to eat late but it is definitely part of the fun and part of the overall experience of Barcelona. We never had a bad experience.  The architecture, art, food and people were everything that we had hoped for and more!   We would leave for dinner at 10 p.m. and stroll through the streets.  We would finish up around Midnight or 1 a.m. and would walk back to the El Palace.  We never felt any fear.  Of course, it is always good to be aware of your surroundings and not pull wads of cash out in public.   Tthere are pickpockets, as everywhere, but if you exercise good judgement and keep your valuables in front pockets and purses in front of you and walk with confidence there won't be any problems. Also, ladies, don't hang your purse on the back of your chair especially in outdoor cafes.

The hotel is in a fantastic location with easy walking access to everything.   Places not to miss!  Sagrada Família - Make sure you go inside ... Incredible!!!  Casa Milà (don't miss the roof terrace).  You might want to take the elevator as it is about 12 flights and pretty exhausting. Anything and everything Gaudi.  Las Ramblas - Experience it both day and night - Completely difference experiences..  During the day a must see is Mercat de Boqueria, this is the most amazing marketplace ever!  Sights, sounds, colors & smells - Beautiful!!    Walk all the way to the end of Las Ramblas, you won't be disappointed.  Eat tapas late at night, one recommendation is Divinus which is about 4 to 5 long blocks from the hotel.  Yummy!  We also ate at 4 Cats which we also loved.  I believe it is located in the Gothic district another area of Barcelona which is terrific to explore!  Narrow alleys filled with shops, tapa bars, cava bars and apartments. You'll have to ask the hotel for the location of  4 Cats, it is pretty tough to find located in a narrow little alleyway but well worth the experience to find it!

Too much to see in just three and a half days!    Day Three, we took a day trip to Montserrat for Cava tasting and a vist to the Basilica.  It was above and beyond and worth the hour trip each way  The Benedictine Monk retreat and Basilica is spectacular with amazing views of Catalunya.  After visiting the Basilica take the cable car to the top of the mountain to experience magnificent views of the very unusual rock formations and breathtaking views from every direction. You will be blown away by the views. Wear good walking shoes and take time to explore!!  

We can't wait to return to Barcelona and we will definitely be back to El Palace Hotel where we received a warm, warm welcome every time we walked in the door!  We belong to Leading Hotels of the World and received some very nice perks such as free Continental breakfast, early check-in and free in-room Internet.  If you forget to pack something, there is every shop in the world in Barcelona.  Save room in your luggage to bring home some treasures.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions - karsd@aol.com.  Above all else, Enjoy Barcelona",5,2011,07,03
29,"Big Disappointment, Poor Value, Surly Reception, and TOO MUCH NOISE AND VIBRATION!!","Barcelona was our last destination on our two week visit to Spain and I thought I had saved the best hotel for last.  Boy, were we disappointed.  The check-in process was the poorest service we received after staying at several wonderful and welcoming hotels in Spain (including the Westin Palace in Madrid, the AlmaSevilla and the Hotel Alhambra Palace).  The male receptionist was downright obnoxious and impolite.  Also, when I asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid the rumble of the subway, he sneered at me and said that he was not aware of any noise or vibration and that the 2nd floor would be fine for our Junior Suite (this conversation took place while several trains shook the reception area).  Well, he was of course very very wrong, the vibration at this hotel is quite intense throughout the property and we were moved to the 5th floor later that evening, but it was still about the same.  We also had to wait over an hour for our bags to be brought up to our room after check-in.  The bellhop seemed very out of sorts when he finally arrived and told us he was too busy.  (understaffed property??)   Also, none of the check-in staff told us about ANY of the amenities of the hotel.  I had to make a point of stopping by the concierge desk and asked them directly, something all our other hotels always make a point of doing (isn't that part of good service??).  In addition, when I called housekeeping and the front desk for service in our room, the phone just rang and rang.  No one picked up at housekeeping and the front desk didn't answer until after about 15 rings.  Deeply frustrated with paying more than $600 a night for terrible service, I went down to the front desk and complained.  They listened while I spoke, but were still generally unhelpful and unwelcoming.  While the room was clean, the size was no where near what we expect from a Junior Suite, just the size of a regular guest room.  Also, the sheets were not of good quality and so filled with pilled areas that it rubbed against my legs and disturbed my sleep (that is when I finally did fall asleep from the metro noise and vibration).  The best part of the room was the bathroom which was spacious.  They have a ""pillow menu"" which is a joke since they don't really provide any special pillows at all.  One other point worth mentioning, the key they provide is a regular key with very large key fob tassle which you much drop off everytime you leave the hotel.  So, when you return, you have to stop by the concierge to pick it up.  This presents two problems:  1) If they are helping someone, you will have to wait quite a long time while until they are finished, 2) they never ask for any identification which made me feel uneasy and questioned their security since at times it was a new concierge who had not seen us before.   There were other issues with the restaurant and concierge service too (ex. no reservation as promised when we showed up at a restaurant) but I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is!  We would never stay at the property again.  It was a complete dissapointment and overpriced.  Be forewarned if you choose it, you will not have a restful satisfying stay.  This is definitely not a 5 or even 4 star property.   BE FOREWARNED IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY HERE!!!!",1,2011,07,01
29,Couldn't have been better !,"From the moment we walked in to the time we left we were treated like Kings. Wonderful staff and service, and an upgrade to a Junior suite! When we are next in Barcelona we know where we'll be staying :)",5,2011,06,27

29,Exceptional,"1. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.
2. Luxurious rooms.
3. Excellent Location.
4. Had inter-connecting rooms.
5. Very exclusive feel.
6. Beautiful lobby.",5,2011,06,25
29,"Comfortable, Elegant and Grand","We stayed for 2 nights in this delightful hotel in a classic deluxe and it was extremely comfortable.  The staff are so welcoming and helpful and the bar service is really slick.  We were on the third floor of the hotel overlooking a side street and only felt the occasional rumble from the metro but it certaintly didn't keep us awake and the soundproofing is so good there is no traffic noise either.  Our room was spacious with a wonderful roomy bathroom that had 2 sinks, bath and great rain shower along with L'Occitane toiletries.  The hotel drinks are very expensive but then it is 5 star but the bar is beautiful.  (Euro 14 for a Bloody Mary and Euro 7 for a coke / coffee / tea).  Perhaps if they lowered their bar prices slightly more people might stay to have a drink (bar was always very empty).  There is also a lovely outside patio area where you can have drinks and breakfast and there is also a downstairs cocktail bar with live music from 10.30.  We didn't eat in the hotel.  We had breakfast each day at Farga a 5 minute walk along Grand Via just past Passeig Garcia.  We would definitely return to this hotel and Barcelona has so much to offer the holidaymaker.  The hotel does not offer free wi-fi but there are terminals you can use.",5,2011,06,20
29,Good location but noisy,Spent two nights at this elegant old hotel.  Impressive public rooms and good central location.  Staff were pleasant and helpful.  The hotel would appear to sit on top of the Metro and our bedroom shook each time a train passed.  The room itself was of good size and quite comfortable - the bathroom was well equipped.  Breakfast was adequate.,3,2011,06,15
29,Excellent Service,"We stayed at El Palace for three nights.  Since we had arranged to stay in a ""hip"" hotel in Madrid, we opted for a traditional, old-school hotel in Barcelona.  There is something to be said for traditional and old-school service that you just do not get in any of these younger, hip hotels!  

The hotel was renovated about a year or two ago, and it is very elegant, opulent and beautiful.  The service is, in one word:  impeccable.  The staff was definitely formal and ready to serve at a moment's notice, but there was always an underlying friendliness and warmth - in other words, I never felt them to be ""snooty"".

We are part of the leaders club, so we were given an upgrade to a junior suite.  We stayed in room 329.  There was no view, but the room was located in a corner of the hotel (not sure if it was side or rear of hotel) and was very, very quiet.  It was quite generous in size, and the bathroom was separated into two separate rooms.  One room held the commode, with a large and spacious vanity area; the other room was another large vanity area with two sinks, and a large shower with wonderful hot-hot-hot water and terrific water pressure.  The towels were fluffy, and they provided slippers and robes.  

To give an example of the impeccable service, I requested an iron and ironing board to touch up some clothing.  I was told it would arrive in ""one minute"".  In what seemed like 45 seconds, they were knocking at the door.  I didn't stand there with a timer or anything, and cannot promise you it was less than one minute, but for sure I can tell you that the iron and ironing board arrived in less than 2 minutes!  The same thing happened when I asked for a bucket of ice. 

Unfortunately, my husband and I were both taken ill on our last day in Barcelona.  A few hours later, when we were not feeling better, we asked the concierge to send a doctor.  Again, with impeccable service, the doctor was knocking on our door in less than 15 minutes.  He prescribed medication, and within a few hours were on our way to recovery and were able to travel to London the next day as scheduled.

The staff couldn't have been nicer - they didn't bother us while we were sick, and upon checkout inquired if we were feeling better, and expressed how sorry they were that we missed our last day of site seeing in Barcelona.  

The hotel is in a great location.  It's walking distance, but away from the noise and craziness of Las Ramblas and the Boqueria.  It is also walking distance from Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera.  It is a cab ride away from Park Guell, which I highly recommend.  I thought it would be ""just a park"", but it is so special and amazing!  Park Guell is located on a hilltop, and even though I am a person that likes to walk, I opted for a cab as it was a warm day out.  It is a long walk to get to the beach, but if you are a walker and if you are out and about exploring, then you will not find it to be that far.  If you don't like to walk that much, then it is probably a quick cab ride to the beach.",5,2011,06,13
29,Very Good Hotel,"Although you'll pay more for this hotel, it's a full-service property that distinguishes itself and is worth it.  All of the staff are very attentive to guests, making you feel at home.  The rooms really are quite spacious and modernly appointed, especially for a large European city such as Barcelona.  The beds were firm and comfortable, the bathrooms had double sinks and plenty of space.  There were a few minor drawbacks.  One evening the concierge sent us to a local fine dining establishment that so awful we walked out without eating our meal after a bite of our entrees.  This really shouldn't happen.  The second challenge is not just with El Palace but throughout Barcelona - when leaving for an early flight there really is no way to grab a quick cup of coffee, maybe even a light breakfast.  The hotel offers a 28 euro ($40) breakfast, but does not serve coffee by the cup until about 8 a.m.  And there's really nothing available throughout the neighborhood.   The hotel really needs to expand breakfast and offer a basic option for American business people and tourists.  Other than that the hotel met and exceeded all of our needs, and kept us relaxed and comfortable through 4 nights in Barcelona.",4,2011,06,12
29,Fantastic hotel with great service and location,"We stayed in a deluxe double room at El Palace for four nights, and had a wonderful time. The staff were charming and attentive, the room spacious and beautifully furnished, and the bathroom (we didn't have one of the Roman baths) very elegant, with both a bath and rainwater shower. The public rooms are opulent and comfortable, with breakfast in the garden/conservatory a relaxed and tranquil affair, served until the supremely civilised hour of 11am - for anyone, like me, who's not a morning person, this is as good as it gets.  

The hotel is well situated for exploring Barcelona, just a couple of roads away from the shopping and street performers of La Rambla, and within easy walking distance of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo. It's a little further to the marina and beach, but still very easily walkable.

Overall, El Palace is a gorgeous, romantic hotel, well worth the money. Can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else in  Barcelona.",5,2011,06,08
29,"Fantastic hotel, loved the Roman bath.","Beautiful hotel, excellent product in room. Loved my Roman bath. The champagne in the grand lounge was excellent and the room itself fabulous. The new night club is uber cool. I had a small problem with the pillow menu. Requested a special pillow as I've a problem neck. Received it the first day, the second day it was taken from our room. Three pillows delivered to room later the second night we're all wrong. Finally got it back day 3. Ordered a car to the airport , the driver was 20 minutes late. We we're trying to phone the hotel when he finally showed up. For $117 Euro he should have been waiting at the airport.  Small problems as hotel is fantastic, staff friendly and helpful!",4,2011,06,07
29,excellent,This was one of the best place we stayed. Great staff. Very helpful with everything. Thanks a million.,5,2011,06,04
29,Fantastic hotel with excellent service,"Well what can I say, this hotel was perfect in every single way. I made the booking some months in advance as a surprise proposal for my now Fiancee. I emailed the hotel for assitance with champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and flowers for our room upon arrival and they were only too pleased to assist. They even gave us a guided tour of the hotel upon arrival.
We were upgraded to a lovely room with a fantastic lighting system. The bathroom was very luxurious with all the added extras you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The mini-bar in the room was expensive, but to be fair they usually always are. Breakfast is a surcharge, so we decided to actually eat out. 
Barcelona is expensive, but it seems that most cities within the Euro zone are equally expensive. The hotel was perfectly located with only a short walk into the main centre. Do be aware though, that Sunday's are very quiet, with the majority of shops closed.
Highly reccomended.",5,2011,06,03
29,"Beautiful facility -- unfortunately located atop a constantly rumbling subway. Also, we had service issues.","The Barcelona metro apparently has a major connection point just under the hotel. From our room, on the second floor, we felt it rumbling all day and most of the night.  It was quite disturbing, and for that reason alone, my husband and I will never go back to this hotel.  A hotel should be a place of rest, where you are calmed by your surroundings. How can that occur when the building is shaking for all of your waking hours?

Our other issue was with service, both with the concierge and at breakfast. Over a month before arriving, I sent  an email to the concierge asking for him/her to make a dinner reservation.  I did not get an immediate response. So about a week before arriving, I sent another email to the concierge, copying the front desk.  I received emails back from BOTH  of them saying that the reservation was already booked.  I thanked them.  Then we arrived, on the night of the reservation, as we were leaving the building, the concierge produced to my husband a sheet with details of our dinner reservation, including the time and the restaurant's address.  We set off for a 15 minute taxi ride. Upon arrival, the hostess looked shocked and said that our reservation was impossible because the entire restaurant had been booked for a private party months before. She was very apologetic about not being able to help, but offered us seats on the following evening -- which we accepted. (And it was terrific, Dos Cielos Restaurant.)  On another night, we asked the concierge for a reservation for a Flamenco show. They told us we were booked for a 7:30 show and then booked a 9:00 dinner reservation at a separate restaurant for us. We arrived at the show at 7:30 and there were no other patrons there.  We were told that the show began at 8:15 pm, but that doors opened at 7:30, so we were welcome to  wait. In our opinion, the concierge should have told us the show was at 8:15 and then have booked dinner for 9:30 or 10:00.  There was just no way to do both the show and dinner in 2 separate locations as they had booked them.  

Our other service issue was at breakfast.  Service was indifferent, if not downright cool.  We felt that we, as guests, were an inconvenience to the staff.  Coffee was offered after maybe 20 minutes at the table and then never refilled unless one made a major effort to flag down the server and then, often only after numerous requests.  No one ever offered us menus, assuming that that everyone would be satisifed with the buffet.  Finally, when we asked for porridge, after waiting 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the server upon being seated, we were told it would take another 20 minutes.  In my view, a guest should be seated and immediately offered menus and asked their beverage selection.  If something will take  20 minutes to prepare, then the guest would receive it after 20 minutes of waiting at the table, not the 40-50 minutes that we experienced repeatedly during our stay. We felt neglected and unsatisifed by this experience.",3,2011,05,29
29,Fabulous!,"Lovely room, terrific bathroom, excellent customer service and Great Location.",5,2011,05,27
29,"Beautiful hotel, great location, but some issues . . .","We stayed at this hotel last week.  The building, location and interior are fantastic.  This was the former Ritz but apparently lost its Ritz status about 8 years ago, according to hotel staff.  We had requested an upper floor.  Upon check-in they upgraded us to a junior suite.  The room was newly rennovated and fanstastic.  Style, service and the rest was great.  It is near the Passeig de Gracia street and metro stop so it is very convenient but out of the circus of La Rambla, etc.  

The issues we had are that the hotel is still trying to be the Ritz with its drink prices, etc.  Mini bar items were between 5 and 15 euros.  A chocolate bar was 15 euros.  A beer in the bar was 8 euros.  Just a bit out of touch for what it was.  Second, the lights flickered on an off the first day we were there but stopped doing that for the rest of the stay.  The shower pressure and temparture were horrible.  It would go from normal to almost off then hot to cold every few seconds.  Not in keeping with the beautiful rennovation on this bathroom.

The biggest issue, and likely the cause of the loss of the Ritz name, is that the metro runs under the building.  Many said it is not a big deal.  We were on the top floor and could still hear/feel it.  It felt like a mini earthquake every 15 minutes. I asked the reception about it and at first he said he didn't know what I was talking about then said it was the metro but it stopped at midnight.  It does NOT stop at midnight.  We heard/felt it all night long.  Reception said it affects every room.

Finally, watch the pickpockets, purse thieves and the (dishonest) cab drivers in Barcelona.  They are everywhere.  We saw a nicely dressed guy in a nice restaurant try to snatch a girls purse.  When we were checking in one of the guest had been pickpockted on La Rambla.  Two and perhaps 3 cab drivers tried to rip us off.  One took us for a long ride and then dumped us at what he said was our stop.  I got out and told him I would pay him once I verified.  When he realized I had got him he sped away without us paying but leaving us stranded in a strange neighborhood.  I speak spanish but they all pretend to get lost and take you accidently to the wrong place/hotel.  So beware.",4,2011,05,26
29,Nice hotel but a few flaws,"We stayed for three nights here.  The location is good, if somewhat noisy.  The room was fine, pretty large and had a fireplace with a TV in a mirror over it.  A young lady found us as we were checking in and was very helpful in recommending restaurants, giving maps, etc.  There were two negatives, however.  There is no free WiFi in the rooms and if you use the business center (which is free) you only get an hour at a time.  Then each time you want to go back, you need to get a new password from the desk.  Very awkward.  This was the only hotel on our trip that didn't offer free WiFi so they should fix this.  The second neg was the breakfast.  It is held in a room that is really outdoors and can be quite chilly in the morning.  They do have heaters they can turn on if you ask.  The hot items on their buffet were consistenly cold.  Cold, runny eggs, cold bacon and sausage, etc.  And don't go to their basement bar - the drinks are outrageous.",3,2011,05,26
29,Best Hotel I have ever been to!,"This was a trip to celebrate a special birthday for my partner, and this certainly turned out to be a special one!!!
I contacted the hotel prior to departure from the UK, to order some champaign for the room on arrival, a massive surprise was waiting at check in, they had upgraded our room from a basic booking to a Junior Suite, and the champaign was on ice, in the room (Absolutely fantastic), this hotel is the most luxurious I have ever been in and our room was stunning due to its decor and comfort, the bathroom was out of this world!
The staff are very friendly, all spoke english and very courteous and we were made to feel very welcome.
The hotels location is only a short walk (10 minute or so) from all the transport links and La Rambla, and is located on one of the very beautiful tree lined streets a few minutes from Placa Catalunya.
We had a wonderful stay, loved this hotel and its little personal touches.
A very big thank you to the Hotel management and staff, for a wonderful stay.",5,2011,05,25
29,A very good hotel - no doubt,"We travelled to Barcelona for the F1 and stayed three nights at El Palace. There is no doubt that this is a very good hotel with large, well appointed rooms and attentive service.

Breakfast was extremely good and the all round service we were given was top notch. The hotel itself is quite impressive with a very posh lounge area when you enter the place. Concierge was knowledgeable and able to recommend / confirm good restaurants.

The hotel bar was a treat. Down a set of stairs and behind a thick velvet curtain, it was like entering a very cool bar in the 1950's (I imagine) - but without the cigarette smoke. A jazz band played on the Friday night of our stay and the fittings and ambience were something from another age. A complimentary glass of Champagne was very well received.",4,2011,05,25
29,Standards need raising,"Arrival is unimpressive -  waiting 10 minutes for a porter to take up one's luggage is sloppy and having only two lifts make coming and going laborious - especially when staff use them as service lifts.  The general impression is that the hotel is understaffed, reinforced by the room service number being eternally engaged.  

The room was a mess - dar, with heavy unmatched furnishings and cheap-looking built-out wardrobes.  The bathroom was good but spoiled by a bidet mounted so close to the wall to be unusable.

The breakfast is good but overall we were most disappointed, feeling that the hotel was better five years ago before the refurbishment.

Altogether not worth five stars and not to be revisited.",2,2011,05,23
29,Everything was fine,"Very friendly hotel, offering quality service and has a convenient location. Comfort rooms, pleasantly decorated and always thoroughly cleaned. A fairly wide selection of dishes for breakfast. Staff attentive and friendly.
 I would recommend this hotel for everyone`s stay in Barcelona, and gladly dwell in it in my next visit to this amazing city.",5,2011,05,19
29,Grandeur and style to match the city..... Excellent,Good Location to give access to all parts of Barcelona. Superb room high above the traffic with soundproofing which really works! We may well have had the best room on the corner sharing a balcony with giant cherubs . Classy service and excellent (though not cheap) breakfast experience. The rain shower is as good as they say. About the only fault is the omission of complementary mineral water in the room.,5,2011,05,15
29,REALLY GRAND,"outstanding service, most comfortable rooms with great bathrooms and excellent bedding, bathroom amenities could be less common. Incredible breakfast in the interior courtyard - Excellent

29,Great location but can be noisy,"Stayed a few days on our way to the Pyrenees.  Hotel is beautiful, service was great.  That said, the bar was expensive (although they did have a GREAT house band!).  The hotel is above a subway station so the rumbling starts early-- make sure you have a top floor and you should be fine.  Staff were all very polite and helpful.",4,2011,05,11
29,A Fabulous Stay in a Truely 5-Star Boutique Hotel,We felt very much at home in this very luxurous hotel. The Reception was friendly & courteous. We were led to our room by the staff personally. Our Classic Delux room was large & very comfortable. The Bath-room was more than adequate & well fitted; the shower stall with the over-head rain shower was so heavenly that we could easily have spent the whole morning/evening inside.Breakfast was a delight in the covered Garden. And best of all was the free 24 hours daily wired high-speed internet service. The location of the hotel was very central with the shops & sights all within walking distance.We have no heasitation in recommending Le Palace Hotel to tourists visiting Barcelona.,5,2011,05,08
29,"Prettty Good Hotel, But Not The Best","I picked this hotel becaue of he reviews on Trip Advisor and it was prettty good. I'd recommend it and I'd probably stay here again. Price a bit high, but location and decor worth it!",4,2011,04,25
29,Absolute luxury with friendly relaxed service - perfect!,"I was a little daunted at first by the grandness & luxury of El Palace but within seconds I felt comfortable & relaxed due to the warm welcome of all members of staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything about the room was wonderful - the Roman Bath room is amazing! In spite of it's location at a busy junction, there was no traffic noise at all.  El Palace is expensive, as you'd expect for a luxury hotel - but worth every euro.",5,2011,04,25
29,Totally Awesome!,"The Hotel was comfortable, clean and Gorgeous! the Staff helped in finding local spots to eat and tips a nd direction on site seeing  and night life. The recently renovated rooms with a victian like decor and madernized bathroom with a deep relaxing bath tub and rain fall shower. The Hotel has an amazing contnential breakfast , which happened to me incuded in my package. What a variety in breads, grains and pastries, basic eggs and beans and extensive savories in cured meats, cheeses and smoked salmon, fresh juices and (Cava) ,Champage. Really got me through the day of exploring the wide spead city. Also in the evning , althogh the drinks were a bit pricey ,the top shelf liquor and the craetive garnishes garnishes made them well worth in the amiance of the scotch bar!  Beautiful decor and fabulous entertainment and an extremely central location , thumbs up times infinity!",5,2011,04,23
29,"Amazing hotel,AAA location,cozy rooms,but a little bit exepensive.","Best location,the hotel is located in an old palace,very well trained and friendly staff.
The rooms were quiet big and the decor was nice,the hotel is a little bit overpriced.",4,2011,04,23
29,Recommend,"El Palace is a genuine 5-star where everything is just right. Except maybe the bar downstairs who has drinks in a very high price range and is deserted for most of the time. Other than that, there isn't anything bad we could say about the place. My room was clean and nicely decorated, airport pick up worked out well and the service in the hotel is firs class. I recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2011,04,21
29,five star hotel ruined by three star management,"The building is lovely, the proportions, size and window light of all the rooms reminiscent of the hotel's hey day as the Ritz. There remain a great many glimpses of that greatness. The welcome on arrival, the grand foyer and the spendour of the Great lounge. 

In  hotel of this quality - and frankly in a guest house of no quality - there is just no excuse for complete lack of hotel wifi. There is some sort of pay per access system. That of itself would be annoying when €2 on a room rate would leave them ahead of the game but it isn't just the money. The system available - even on their own PC's in the ""business suite"" - requires entering personal details including email address and a valid mobile number so that one can receive spam for years to come. Utterly hideous. 

And then there were just an array of little details betraying the fact that the owners of this grand old place simply don't have 5 star DNA. Some would be easy to overlook or forgive except that this hotel is brand new after a two year refit. So many silly little cost saving corners have been cut that the place is the shape of a football!  The bathrooms have cheapest most hideous toilette tissue that no guest in this hotel will ever have in their home. King size beds (in all three of the rooms of our group) made up by pushing together two singles, Not just separate divans and separate mattresses but even the three inch thick mattress toppers were separate so that only the polycotton sheet joins them. 

Hiding the flat screen TV behind a mirror might have seemed like a swish way of maintaining a period look, but the TV maker uses a mirror and frame from B&Q which would never have graced a room in this hotel otherwise. Meanwhile the TV itself is so small in a postage stamp in the centre of the mirror so that subtitles are barely readable. No DVD player, no ipod connection, no radio, no usb connection. 

On the plus side there is a tremendous basement bar with live music which makes you feel you have stepped back 70 years. The food is is fine and served in decent quantity if not terribly exciting. The position is great and an easy walk to all the good bits of Barcelona (a fairly long walk to the beach but ok).",4,2011,04,05
29,Our most favorite hotel on our trip,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel. The room and the bathroom were very well appointed and incredibly beautiful. We received very personal service from everyone who worked at the hotel. Great dining recommendations from the concierge. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2011,04,03
29,Pure quality and exceptional service,"El Palace Hotel is by far the most elegant hotel that I have stayed at in Europe. The staff are committed to service. We were greeted upon arrival by Celine who showed us around the hotel and took us to our room. We had a Privilege Junior Suite with our 7-year-old. The suite offered a very large bedroom with flat screen TV, connecting sitting room with flat screen TV and an enormous bath - I mean HUGE! Double sinks, closets, separate tub and shower, plus separate water closet. The suite also had a separate half bath with sink and toilet which is great when you have a child with you on vacation. When we came back from sightseeing for a few hours after checking in, we were surprised to see a wonderful treat waiting for us - Cava, orange juice and a lovely cake - all of which we enjoyed after dinner at the hotel's casual restaurant. Plus they had made up a rollaway bed for our daughter and left her a lovely plush bear to take home. All in all, an excellent stay that we will always remember.  FYI - make sure to go down to the new bar and try both the Mojito and Espresso Martini - they are THE BEST!",5,2011,04,03
29,The El Palace is a fine hotel in an excellent location.,"I stayed at the El Palace for four nights in late March 2011.  Prior to choosing it, I read other reviews of the hotel, which were nearly all positive, and I must join in praising the El Palace Hotel.  
I can't imagine that the hotel was any more luxurious or comfortable when it was the Ritz prior to 1993.  It has old world-style elegance and sophistication, in a location in the L'Exiample that cannot be exceeded for convenience to everything, and with courteous, friendly service that is without fault, from porters to waiters to front desk staff to concierge staff.   
Several reviews had mentioned a rumbling noise from the subway that goes underground near the hotel.  My room was on the fifth floor,overlooking the Gran Via, and I DID hear the subway one time for about 15 seconds while I was in the bathroom, but it never disturbed my stay in any way.  In fact, I can find nothing about the hotel to criticize.
I will return to the El Palace when I return to Barcelona, and I would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2011,04,02
29,Elegant hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"We spent 6 nights in this hotel and enjoyed every minute.  Our room was comfortable, spacious, well laid out, bright and had windows overlooking the Gran Via.  Little touches like the walk in wardrobe and bathroom separated from the bedroom by a passage were really thoughtful.  We were on the third floor and yes, we could hear the metro rumble, but we didn't find it intrusive.  The staff could not have been more helpful.  If you are staying over a Sunday, the afternoon brunch is superb and well worth the price.  The hotel is well located and most of the sights are within walking distance.  We found the Metro really easy to use for getting to places like Park Guell",5,2011,04,01
29,"Very clean, good location,excellent rooms and staff.!",My only suggestion is to use coffee jars for filter coffee in each table with the essential milk at the breakfast rather than waiting the staff to refill your cup .,5,2011,03,31
29,"Wonderful hotel... feeling of the ""Ritz"" back in the days!","But with the updated comforts of home...maybe even better!  A short walk from the Plaza Catalunya...we found the staff ready to cater to us in ever way.  From the doorman to the concierge to housekeeping...top service!  Turn down service with chocolates to booking our tours...wonderful service abounds.  The room we were given was just magnificent...over looking the Gran Via Corts.  The room more than lived up to expectations with all the amenities.  Starting with the room lighting...fantastic.  Sensors for lights on the hallway turns on automatically, the size of the room and elegant style but the best part was the bathroom.  With forest rain shower effect that will pamper anyone.  We have stayed in many luxury hotels and this hotel is in the lines of the St. George Palace Hotel in Athens and Luna Bagliolini in Venice or even the Grand Hotel Europe in St. Petersburg.  The noise from the tram is a minor nuisance and the room can use coffee makers...but that's all we can think of that can make the stay greater.  Coming from Belgium prior to Barcelona where we stayed at Royal Windsor Hotel by the Grand Place...this hotel wins by a mile.  Warm staff, wonderful hotel, beautiful city...makes a perfect ending to a fantastic European vacation.",5,2011,03,31
29,"Great hotel, perfect location","We stayed here for 5 nights with our 16 year old daughter who was finishing up an exchange program in Barcelona.  The staff went out of its way to make sure we had an enjoyable stay - - you could tell that they are knocking themselves out to bring back the old Ritz glamour and hospitality and it shows. We booked the Junior Privilege Suite and it was perfect for the three of us, king bed, nice sitting area, and a high quality rollaway that was set up for our daughter and made up with all the best linens.   We loved the huge dressing room/closet that gave everyone privacy. The piece de resistance; however, was the bathroom which was the largest we've ever had in Europe. Enormous tub, separate walk in shower, large enough for four people with two overhead showerheads and two hand held shower nozzles, L'Occitane bath products, loofah sponges, thick towels, bathrobes, slippers - the works. And a good size toilet area within the bathroom but containing a heavy high quality door for privacy. Could not have asked for anything else. Reading lights everywhere and accessible. Motion detector light that went on and off in case you had to use the bathroom at night. Large screen tv with a swivel.  We had a back room so it was also very quiet. 
And there is simply no better location - - we walked all over the city from our hotel with ease. My daughter's host family, who have lived in Spain for generations, confirmed this - - saying they couldn't imagine a better located hotel.
All in all a wonderful place!",5,2011,03,30
29,"five star hotel , five star experience","We booked joint flight and hotel deal and the Palace more than lived up to fairly high expectations. It is five star luxury and service all the way from the moment you arrive to your departure. The staff are all very friendly, helpful but also professional. Nothing is too much trouble. The ambience is luxury and I would put this hotel on a par with the famous Sacher in Vienna but not so expensive.
There is a slight rumble from the Metro below at times but nothing to really worry about in sumptuous rooms with all the mod cons in the bathroom etc.
Breakfast in the covered garden area offers plenty of choice in comfort. All round a memorable stay.",5,2011,03,29
29,Period hotel close to downtown,"Stayed there for three nights in March and had a great time. Rooms were top quality as is to be expected at a property of this level. The period theme of the property makes it very pretty. The included breakfast had a lot of variety. It's within walking distance of Las Ramblas - the main tourist drag, the port area and also the old city. Staff was polite and extremely helpful. The only caveat is that they don't offer  unpaid wi-fi which I find puzzling since they provide ethernet access included in the hotel room price. Other than that, I have no complaints about the hotel.",4,2011,03,26
29,Great Elegant Hotel – Highly Recommended,"Pros 

Great, elegant, lovely hotel at a reasonable rate. Rooms were great; spacious with a huge bed, walk in wardrobe and a small balcony. Nice bathroom and no problems with the shower temperature. Location was good being close to the main square (Catalunya) and a few Metro stations. The staff were friendly and helpful. 

Cons

I asked for a room on a high floor away from the lift and noise of metro. Unfortunately none of these requests were adhered to. To be fair I didn't kick up a fuss as we had a room looking out onto the street, with a balcony. Food in the hotel is very expensive (28 Euro for breakfast I think) and unfortunately the noise from the Metro can be pretty annoying at times.",4,2011,03,25
29,Such a wonderful home away from home in Barcelona!,"We were spoiled rotten by El Palace from the moment we arrived. Everyone is delightful, kind, thoughtful, helpful, and VERY willing to make the extra effort on your behalf. We had a dinner reservation one night at a VERY obscure restaurant (La Luna-you MUST go!) and ad Con Gracia (don't even think about NOT going!) and even the door man made the extra effort to explain to the cab driver where in the world we were going in Barcelona. The concierge were equally as helpful and the rooms, beds, bathrooms, were all exactly as one could hope for. The biggest plus - AFTER the incredibly attentive service - is the perfect location!! Don't hesitate to stay here - you won't be disappointed!!!",5,2011,03,24
29,would stay at this hotel again in an instant FABULOUS,"beautiful lobby, beautiful guest rooms, beautiful terrace for breakfast, excellent and attentive staff, perfect location, short walk to all major tourist sites, bottle of sparkly in room on arrival, perfect way to start a vacation!",5,2011,03,24
29,Good location and hotel but lots of flaws,"Location - Excellent, a few minutes walk from the placa catalunya.
Cost - Good, it says it's a five star but that can be disputed, on the site of the former Ritz hotel it has a very plush interior and lobby, this is not however to the standards of any decent 5 star hotel, more like a 4. Overall much cheaper than most decent 5 stars.
Rooms- We were in a room on the first floor, this meant we could hear (and feel the room shake) every time a subway train passed by. This happens every 10 minutes from 05.30 to 24.00. We asked to be moved but was told nothing was available. The beds were very firm and not of the standard expected at a five star hotel, they need to call the Four Seasons and ask where they get their beds from.
Room service- The menu was limited and very expensive, there are however some nice restaurants around so you can avoid room service if you have to.
Staff - Very good and extremely friendly, they are the hotels main plus point.
Overall we enjoyed our time in Barcelona and the hotel was ok, I don't think i would return though as im sure there are others that are better.",3,2011,03,23
29,If you stay in Barcelona - stay here - wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, impeccable service and friendly staff made our stay for my husband's 40th wonderful.  We booked 2 nights here and 2 nights in the AbAC hotel - wish we had booked the full 4 nights here.  Love the coctail bar with Live band playing at 10.30 and 12.30 - so perfect way to end an evening out.  Stunning lounge and breakfast rooms - we pushed the boat out and had breakfast there just once - 30 Euros each! - pleasant enough but was likewarm - but tasty.  Overall if I go to Barcelona again - I would definately choose this hotel - cash permitting.  Not the cheapest place to stay - but worth every penny in my book.  Location is very good - walkable to Cathedral, Las Ramblas and Placa Cataluna etc so a very good base if you want to walk to some of the sights.  Overall excellent hotel.",5,2011,03,21
29,Great hotel---some suggestions though,"This hotel is luxurious and beautiful and in a great location. The staff are friendly and the hotel is good value. We booked more than a month in advance on booking.com and got a great room for €140 the first night and €160 the second night which is amazing value for a 5 star hotel. The place has L'Occitane toiletries and cool mirrors that double as TVs. My only complaints are that the beds are hard and the pillows aren't great, and the guys at the check-in desk were not very friendly. One of them even took a personal call on his mobile phone while he was checking us in. He didn't really greet us or seem welcoming. But the rest of the staff were very nice. We will stay there again when we come to Barcelona!**Just make sure you stay on a high floor since the Metro runs underneath the hotel and rumbles a lot",5,2011,03,21
29,Only wish our visit could have been longer,"We stayed in a Privilege Junior Suite.  Unfortunately, we only had two nights to spend in Barcelona, but this hotel made it very enjoyable.  The Junior Suite was lovely with a fabulous bathroom including a separate shower and toilet room, whirlpool tub and walk-in closet.  The hotel was conveniently located for sight-seeing,  and the staff was helpful and friendly.  We also highly recommend dinner at the Michelin-starred Caelis and drinks in the jazz club/bar on the lower level.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,03,14
29,Great place to rest your head...,"Location - good location. Metro stop is 3 minute walk at the end of the road. La Rambla is about 10 minute walk. The airport bus stop is about 7 minutes away. Ideal really.

Rooms - the room was big enough, good internet connection and really modern and clean bathrooms. Nice little features in the rooms, such as mini bar hidden behind a painting and the mirror changes to a tv. Nice touch.

Staff - All very friendly and helpful.

Food - the food was delicious, but we only had breakfast here. 

Thank you for the lovely stay.",5,2011,03,11
29,Almost perfect,"First time in Barcelona we initially planned to stay at a regular hotel, but when booking I did a search for a historical hotel in Barcelona and hit El Palace. The price was reasonable and the location looked great so it wasn't a hard decision. So with great expectations, we walked from the train to the hotel. (Easy to find, short walk) Would this be a hotel like the Grand Plaza in Rome ? (In that hotel we recieved fantastic service simply by smiling and being polite to all of the staff - I know a lot of people has another experience) But this was even better. Smaller, but in every other way better. We did anyway smile to everyone and got lots in return. We almost felt like a part of a big family after a few days. 
Well, some facts now. A room of proper size, not big, but big enough. French balcony and a big luxurious bath. No noise from the street outside. The location was, as expected perfect. We used our legs almost all the time. Almost everything was within walking distance, from La Rambla to La Sagrada Familia.
So why just almost perfect ? 
Well....I have a back which due to a small injury needs a medium to soft matress, and when it is as hard as they were at El Palace I can't sleep more than a couple of hours before it hurts. Knowing how to deal with my back I asked for an extra thin matress on the top. The concierge said  that this was no problem, but when the maid came (Probably the head-maid, she was the archtype of a spanish grandmother :)  she said that it was not possible to do this. I tried to tell her that it was just to.......but got just No-No-No in return. Hard luck...
I didn't want this to ruin an in every other way perfect week, so I tried to ignore it, and after three more nights I probably got used to it, and managed to sleep all night.
Do we want to go back ? In Barcelona yes. 
But for the best hotelbed in the world, try The Peninsula in NY.",5,2011,03,08
29,Outstanding!!,"We stayed in February for 3 nights and our stay was absolutely outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  The concierge could not have been more helpful in organizing excursions for us, suggesting and making reservations at restaurants, and recommending what to see.  We had been to Barcelona before so we wanted to see things we had not seen before.  The rooms were gorgeous and the lobby sitting room was magnificent.  The location was ideal.  Easy walking to all areas.  I would highly recommend this hotel to all.",5,2011,02,25
29,Ideal in Every Way,"As with every hotel afilliated with the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" chain that I have stayed in, I found the Palace entirely satisfactory.  Its location is ideal, centrally located between the old town and the bustling Eixample, giving easy access to both the medieval core and the modern city.  The gothic cathedrals and the twentieth century Gaudi and Montaner houses are all within a short, pleasant stroll; Sagrada Familia is a convenient subway ride away.  As for the hotel itself, the staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful, always had at least adequate English, and fulfilled every request.  The hotel cultivates a (perhaps inauthentic, but nevertheless pleasing) old-world charm, with a grand lobby, doormen in snappy uniforms, and much bowing and scraping.  The building is elegant and our room, while not enormous, was adequate, with an excellent view, a large and comfortable bathroom with double sinks, a good shower, and superior sound buffering.  Last but not least, the Palace offered what may be the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on.",5,2011,02,21
29,Good hotel at reasonable price,"I stayed here in February 2011 for three nights. Staff was friendly and gave me the right advice about places to visit and to eat in the city. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I have to say that the bath wasn’t that comfortable and the hot water on the shower wasn’t keeping the water temperature stable. Also from the room you can hear the underground trains passing by, but none of these was a major issue. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2011,02,11
29,Warmest welcome in sumptous surroundings...a perfect stay!,"We had only one night in Barcelona before leaving on a cruise and wanted it to be memorable. Our stay at the El Palace was more than memorable. It was enchanted!
Upon arrival, Katarina took us on a private tour of the meticulously restored Palace.  A masterpiece in itself.  Our high ceiling room was lovely and quiet.  The location is convenient for the Gothic quarter and Gaudi's masterpieces,  really central to all the main 
sights.  We could walk nearly everywhere.  That evening we were too weary to go out, and had a lovely dinner in the elegant Lobby Cafe.  A continental breakfast in the room was included in our rate. A perfectly set table was rolled in on a draped serving cart.  Nice!
The conceirge was helpful as well with ideas for walking routes and the managers sent us small art books as a gift.  Could there have been any more done for us?  
We definitely recommend El Palace and hope to return.  As we were off season our rate was reasonable for this hotel, although other seasons can be quite high.",5,2011,02,09
29,Great hotel at a surprisingly reasonable price!,"We spent a week here last month and were very pleased with our stay.  Perhaps because January is not the busy tourist season for Barcelona, the rates were very reasonable for such a luxurious hotel.  We paid 205 euros a night for a ""Classic Deluxe"" with a king bed.  I just looked at the  hotel's web site and it seems to be showing even cheaper rates for February.  

The room we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous, having been recently renovated.  It had beautiful fabrics, carpet, and wall-coverings, and very good sound proofing.   The hotel is on a corner, the intersection of two busy streets.  We were on the fifth floor overlooking Carrer Roger de Lluria.  All we had to do was close the window and the traffic noise was gone.  The vintage building has been outfitted with steel framed, double-glazed windows that seal tightly and very effectively block the street noise.  However, the best part of the room was the beautiful, spacious, completely redone bathroom.  It had a tub, a separate walk-in shower, and a large countertop with two sinks.  The toilet was in a separate compartment with a sliding frosted glass door.  Compared to the usual cramped and inconvenient European bathrooms that I'm used to encountering, this place was superb.   They even included a beautiful, live (not plastic!) orchid sitting on the countertop in the bathroom.  The room was really more like what I usually find in a high-end American resort than in an urban hotel in Europe.  I have stayed in rooms in Europe comparable to this one, but they typically cost two to three times as much as this.

The staff of the hotel could not have been more gracious or accommodating.  The reception desk personnel, concierge, and door man were all very welcoming and helpful.  Guests have to deal with concierge frequently because your room key needs to be turned in to the concierge every time you leave the hotel.  The rooms keys here are attached to a large fabric tassel that you don't want to carry in your pocket.  I haven't encountered this for years in a big city in Europe, but here you leave your key with the desk when you step out of the hotel.  The locks on the rooms seem to be some kind of fancy electronic system, but there aren't any of the usual plastic key cards.  it all worked fine though and there was always someone at the concierge desk when you needed your key.  

The staff at breakfast in the Garden were also very pleasant and accommodating.  Breakfast was pricey -- 28 euros -- but the elaborate buffet was great.  There were hot scrambled eggs, lavish Spanish hams and cheeses, fresh-squeezed fruit juices, and a huge array of fresh pastries.  The ""Garden"" is sort of a large tented space that is heated with propane heaters when it's chilly.  It's a beautiful space with a glass wall at the end of it overlooking a small outdoor area with a fountain.  We enjoyed the breakfast so much that we went every day during our stay, despite the cost. 

I noticed another posting that mentioned problems with the elevators.  Both guest elevators were out of service at one point during our stay.  The staff did a very good job of seeing that everyone was promptly escorted to a service elevator in a staff area of the hotel to go upstairs.  It wasn't too much of problem for us, but for a traveler with mobility challenges, it could be a big problem.  The service elevators are a long walk from the lobby and it's up a half flight of stairs and down a another half-flight to get there.  It did appear that you could access the service elevators from a street entrance without having to negotiate any stairs, although we never did that.

Interestingly, free WiFi was available in the lobby and using an ethernet connection in the room was also free.  The front desk will provide you with an ethernet cord if you need one. However, WiFi in the room was only available at a stiff price.  I was traveling with an iPad that can only use  a WiFi connection, so I just succumbed and paid a ridiculous 40 euros for every 72 hours of WiFi service in the room.  Unfortunately, this hotel's website, like most hotel websites, provides no useful details about internet service.

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would absolutely stay here again.  We've already recommended the hotel to a friend who is planning a visit to Barcelona and we hope to return next winter.",5,2011,02,06
29,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"on average an excellent hotel with very nice rooms, very professional staff ( kind, polite and efficient) and the best breakfast i found in Barcelona.
Really a very good hotel to recommand and thanks to all the staff .",5,2011,02,04
29,So beautiful!,"This hotel was intended as a one night splurge after our cruise.  It did not disappoint.  I had been sick on the cruise so we asked for a room with two toilets.  They upgraded us to a fabulous suite.  The service was attentive, especially because the elevators were both under repair and we had to use the service elevator.  We were there on a Sunday, and nothing is open.  There was no soup to be found within a 7 block radius of the hotel.  So the hotel made up chicken soup for me!  While it was pricey, it hit the spot.

If you like a hotel with an old world atmosphere, great service, and can afford the prices, this is the place to stay!  All that and free internet too!",5,2011,01,28
29,The best of the very best,"Went with fiancée for 3 nights. From the time of check-in it felt like a great holiday. The room was large & modern. Very comfortable bed. Large and spacious bathroom. Got a nice view of the main street from the window. 

Location couldn't have been better. Service was impeccable from all the staff. Concierge recommended wonderful restaurants and shops. Very well placed out business center with free internet. Truly felt like staying in a grand palace.",5,2011,01,25
29,Absolutely beautiful hotel and perfect location for tourists!,"Our family vacationed in the mediterranean last summer and spent 4 days at this hotel. We couldn't be more pleased. The staff was so courteous and friendly.  When we first arrived, we were greeted so warmly and the bellhop brought our bags to our room and went over all the controls, the tv inside the mirror, and other details. The rooms were lovely with balconies and granite bathrooms with waterfall showers. The lobby was exquisite. We took some beautiful portraits of the kids in the lobby. It was so close to the La Rambla. So convenient. The trains were close by, too. Sightseeing was a breeze from this location. What a lovely stay. We did not use the restaurant or the spa facilities. No time. So can't comment on that. I highly recommend this hotel. We felt so special here.",5,2011,01,23
29,Lovely Hotel with Impeccable Service,"This hotel is the former Ritz in Barcelona and has been well-restored.  The rooms are beautiful (though the TV positioning a bit odd), and the bathrooms are large and clean.  The lunch food we had was delicious.  The staff are extremely attentive, and always willing to help you navigate Barcelona or find a restaurant.  You truly feel like the only guest in what is a rather large hotel.",4,2011,01,17
29,"Excellent, with a few qualifications","We stayed at El Palace for a week and generally had a very enjoyable experience. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, though drawer space in our walk-in closet was almost non-existent. Our third floor windows completely shut out the noise from the main avenue right outside. The hotel retains the very lavish and ornate style of its Ritz heritage so be prepared for that kind of opulent decor.

The service was generally as one would expect, but if you've stayed at other top hotels in the world, especially in Asia, you'll notice it's very much of the European variety, i.e. efficient and courteous but without a sense of genuine warmth. The concierge in particular suffered from this.

Food was good and we had a wonderful meal at Caelis (although the cavernous dining room borders on a ballroom feeling). Prices are as you would expect in a five star European hotel, and we ate breakfast elsewhere most mornings.

We found the location to be excellent. It's close to the centre of things and in an upmarket area of town, far enough away from the tourist hotspots.

Comments by other reviewers are worth noting. The rumble from the metro line directly below is quite noticeable but didn't bother us too much. Yes, our shower also ran hot and cold, and we found that the bath water wasn't especially hot (this improved after we mentioned it to them). Pillows are strange, as the standard issue appears to be a kind of lumpy bolster - not what you'd expect in a five star. There is a 'pillow menu', which we asked for and managed to obtain soft down and feather ones. But this menu was nowhere apparent in our room - odd if you make a point of having such a thing. It's little points like this which can be faulted at El Palace - there's nothing seriously wrong, but they need to pay a little more attention to some of the small details before they will rank among the top players internationally.",4,2011,01,12
29,"Superb, a real 5 star hotel !!!","Great hotel with superb lobby and salon. Rooms and bathrooms are very comfortable and luxurious. The shower is simply great !!! The hotel is very well located, close to most attractions in Barcelona. Food and room service are great, expensive but great. Worth the fare if you want a top quality experience.
Hotel personnel knows about top dinning and is willing to help you with reservations.",5,2010,12,14
29,Wonderful Hotel!,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at El Palace Hotel. The staff always treated us very well.
The lobby is beautifully furnished. The rooms were spacious and luxurious. The bathroom was quite large with a toilet room, 2 sinks, a tub, and separate shower. Everything was clean and well kept. Our room was on the 4th floor and was very quiet. The hotel is in a great location. Very easy to walk to Las Ramblas & Gaudi's houses. The hotel is Old 
World luxury with modern amenities. Very nice! We would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,11,29
29,"Lovely, but a bit strange.","The public rooms are lovely. The rooms and bathrooms large, but a bit strange. The shower was always shifting fro scalding hot to freezing so you had to learn the sound to get out of the way of impending change. They are skimpy with towels and while the room is clean overall, it could have used a bit more attention in the details. The restaurants are lovely and the food is good, but very expensive. Breakfast is a real treat. The staff is very friendly, but the concierge(s) are VERY vague and misleading. We asked for directions and were sent on a wild goose chase more often than not. We asked for a restaurant within walking distance and were given a few choices, all strange and the one we ended up choosing was so frenetic and the service so poor, we ended up leaving after the first course. We waited more than an hour for the entree... it never came. An interesting choice, but perhaps not the best for us in the future. We were on the 5th floor and did not experience the metro noise others have mentioned.",4,2010,11,17
29,definitely grand lux,"Recently stayed at the Palace. Beautiful hotel. Paid a few euro extra over other  five star hotels and well worth it.  Definitely Five Star Grand Lux.  Entire hotel was recently redone and they did an excellent job of keeping the old world luxury and blending modern conveniences. Staff was friendly and helpful although restaurant suggestions were not that great. Better off using Trip Advisor. Room was spacious, immaculate, washroom was clean and modern.  I suggest having breakfast (it's expensive!!) at least once in the dining area. If the day is mild, they open the doors and it is wonderful.  The bar at night is a great area to unwind with a drink before calling it a night. The room was very quiet. We did hear the train but it was not an issue and did not affect our sleep. Much happier that staying on Las Ramblas. Close to everything.",5,2010,11,04
29,Lovely Hotel,"Confirm other's reviews - spacious bathrooms, quality fixtures and fittings, calm tradionally furnished rooms. Pictures on the website are accurate. Excellent location. We were on the first floor and although we did 'feel' rather than hear the metro it didn't seem frequent and certainly did not disturb us. The public areas seemed little used - prices heavy, more so than a usual 5*.",5,2010,11,04
29,Superb hotel with excellent staff,This is a lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive. it's a pleasure to return to after a day of sightseeing. Very well located and good value too.,5,2010,11,03
29,Great Location...But,Just spent 4 nights at the Palace.  Room was great but the street noise was terrible.  The windows did nothing to shut out the noise and the worse thing was the hotel sits on top of the Metro.  You hear the rumble of the trains all night.  It is like the train stops and starts under your bed.  When I went to check out they wanted to charge me a different rate than what was on my printout.  They had much discussion of this.  They tried to tell me it was my fault that the rates were wrong.  I told them that it was their website printout not mine.  The gentleman was mad and threw my papers over on another desk.  He blamed me for not telling her before check out......What?  However he did only charge me the rate that was on my printout.  We travled all over Spain and this was the most expensive hotel and our  least favorite.,3,2010,11,02
29,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I visited Barcelona again this weekend, we've been several times as we love the city. It's an easy weekend get away for us living in southern Spain. This time we took two great friends and we all went to see Michael Buble at the Palau San Jordi arena. 

2 things, if you ever get to see Michael Buble you WILL enjoy it, he's an amazing entertainer and secondly the Palau San Jordi is a great arena for concerts. 

Anyway, to the point, I was responsible for making all the arrangements for the concert, flights and hotel and was delighted when the flight was on time and the concert seats were just 20 rows from the front!! So I just needed the hotel to match up to everyone's expectations and it most certainly did. 

I must have been lucky and stumbled across a true bargain offer for the hotel as we only paid 149 euro per room for the 1 night we were there which is way below their usual rate. 

I always use Tripadvisor to make decisions on hotels etc and this choice was one of my best. The Palace certainly lives up to it's name, very palatial indeed right from the very first step from their entrance door into the lobby, it's amazing.

The bar and lounge area is stunning. The bedrooms (we had the standard room) are great, nice size with a well equipped bathroom. The shower is in the ceiling and is about 2 feet square, just like a warm rain forest! We didn't have a mini bar in our room strangely, however our friends did in theirs, this is irrelevant to us as we don't use the mini bars anyway. The best feature in the room though was the TV. 

We didn't think it had one at first but heard voices when we walked in the room and activated the electricity, the TV or some other sound system had clearly come on but we couldn't find it, then we looked at the mirror on the wall - it was also the TV, never seen this before, just great!

If I had to be picky about  the hotel in order for you to get a rounded view of our trip I would say this: For some, the rumbling of the underground  (Metro) system - at least I assumed it was that - could be a nuisance, it didn't bother us though. 

Secondly, they are a bit naughty with their bar prices.  Come on, you expect to pay top prices for a 5 star hotel with a 2 star Michelin restaurant and that wasn't the issue, it  was how the cost was made up. For example a Gin and Tonic was 10 euro, fine no problem. When the bill came for 7 drinks (mixture - all alcohol) it was 99 euro. When we queried how this was so the waiter told us that they had just changed policy on how drinks are charged for, since the Michelin Star chef and his company took over things - basically they charge extra for the mixer that goes with your gin, vodka or rum! Like I say, not really a big issue as we expected high prices, it's just how it was done that niggled us a bit as it was not clear at all in the drinks menu, hey ho you live and learn. Didn't spoil our stay one bit, we just laughed about it but I can see how some people may get just a little annoyed at this. 

Brilliant hotel, great city, we'll be back!",5,2010,11,02
29,Old World Glamour + Modern Amenities,"The Palace Hotel definitely stands out among the numerous contemporary, chic hotels with minimalistic aesthetics.  The lobby and the rooms are elegant and romantic, and equipped with all sorts of modern amenities.  The decor was elaborate but tasteful, evoking old world glamour.  While the room we had wasn't particularly big, the bathroom (double vanity, separate tub and shower) and the walk-in closet were so spacious that it felt like a mini-suite.  The garden in which breakfast was served was lovely as well - bright, airy and beautifully furnished.",5,2010,10,25
29,Lovely but.......,"Lovely elegant hotel. Great location on Gran Via as others have mentioned. Definitely their greatest asset is the staff....all very kind and accomodating. Spacious room but the bed was not the most comfortable and the pillows were very hard....causing sore necks & heads each morning. When asked for a softer pillow none were to be had......and no attempt to get one. ...a variety would help.
Very quiet location which is great after a day of sight-seeing. 
However the bar and lounge area were empty each night of our 3 days there. We would have liked to have relaxed there  for a nightcap after our great dinners out but it just felt so desolate in the lounge. No doubt it was empty due to the outrageous drink prices. We've had cocktails all over Europe as well as all across North America...from N.Y. to Chicago to L.A. and Vancouver to Toronto but these were the most extreme prices.",4,2010,10,25
29,"Perfect location, good service, great rooms","We stayed here at the start of our Spain/Portugal trip with daughters aged 9 and 11.  The location is great - good, safe neighborhood, close to the Placa Cataluyna, easy walk to the Gaudi masterpieces, Gothic quarter, and everything else.

We requested: connecting rooms, high floor, away from elevator, breakfast included, and a ride from the airport.  All were attended to perfectly.  

Our rooms were very large and connected as requested.  Check-in was efficient and helpful.  The concierge made a reservation for us at El Gran Cafe, per my request.  

The beds were very comfortable.  Although the hotel is on a busy street, our room was very quiet due to excellent soundproofing.

The second night, the concierge recommended a restaurant called Windsor, which was a taxi ride (we could have walked, but it's a longer walk).  The food was excellent - and they were very helpful about modifying the items for kids' palates (our kids eat fairly adventurously, but things like ensuring fries as the side went over very well!).  

We ate lunch in the hotel restaurant one day - I wouldn't recommend this.  The food was good, but it was rather expensive and I think we would have done just as well to explore on our own.  It was convenient, however!

The breakfast was very good - many choices of foods and beverages.  The room in which they serve breakfast is lovely.

The hotel doormen and bellmen were great about getting taxis, loading our suitcases, and so forth.",5,2010,10,24
29,One of the greatest hotels,"This hotel is a great place and it is realy five star hotel. We stayed there for a weekend in April, it was gift for my girlfriends birthsday. We had wonderful stay in this hotel and Barcelona is a beautiful city.",5,2010,10,23
29,Gracious but not very good,"I agree with Gradpop in his assessment of this hotel.  We had multiple problems, beginning with the fact that they gave us a small  room for two people/king size bed, when we had requested a room to accomodate three people. Initially we were told that they would not be able to fit  a cot in the room, but magically that changed when I said we will pay extra ( ended up costing 80 euros extra a night for that cot!).  Changing the room was also not an option.We were also promised an upgrade ( in writing on our reservation), but were told at check in that this was a ""miscommunication"". Finally, we were told by the concierge we may purchase internet service directly from the kubi supplier, which we did-but as Gradpop noted did not have adequate service (i.e. no or sporadic connection). We had to use the computer in the hallway-and on the last night discovered we could get service in the bathroom! When we told the hotel about this issue we were advised that they could not help us, because we purchased the service directly from Kubi.  Gradpop might be interested to know that we were told they had never  had this wi-fi  issue before!  Overall, a very frustrating experience.  However courteous the staff may be, their ineffectual response to the errors/ problems that we encountered is simply unacceptable. We are returning to Barcelona again in one month, and will definitely NOT be staying here again.",2,2010,10,19
29,Beyond excellent!,"This is one of the best, if not the best,  hotel we have ever stayed in.  Everything was perfect - service, staff, assistance, cleanliness, location, bar, restaurant .",5,2010,10,19
29,"Wow! Incredibly beautiful, luxurious hotel at an exceptional price!","We reserved El Palace for our last night of our tour of Spain.  I had read that the hotel had just completed a renovation, which is what I always look for in hotels (new always trumps worn). What I didn't realize is that El Palace used to be the Ritz, so the renovation went all out luxury. 

Before I describe the room, etc., I should say that this hotel is extremely well situated, just a few blocks from the Gaudi buildings and the Passeig de Gracia.  You can easily walk to everything from here.

For no reason at all, we were upgraded to a junior suite, which was one of the most spectacular rooms we have stayed in.  The king-sized bed had the requisite fine crisp sheets, ample pillows, and super comfortable mattress.  The room was large enough to have a love seat, coffee table, and two chairs for relaxing in.  Blackout silk drapes assured total darkness over large soundproof windows (that opened!), but the most sophisticated lighting system I have seen in a hotel room assured plenty of light at night. The suite had a huge closet/cloakroom with a full length mirror and tons of storage.  The limestone clad bathroom was so spacious and perfectly clean and new, I could have lived in it.  Two sinks, a jacuzzi tub, toilet in its own stall, and a huge shower, with double rain-head showers, a long bench and two handheld showers created all this comfort.  What luxury!  

In the morning, the breakfast was delicious (as it was all over Spain).  However, I have to give special kudos to the pastry chef.  I am a food writer specializing in bread, and had some of the best chocolate croissants I have ever eaten. Also, the bread in Spain tends toward mediocrity (why?), so I was delighted to finally get some delicious crispy, very fresh, whole wheat rolls. The buffet was served in the garden room, with a full array of juices, cured meats and fish, fruit, hot beverages, English breakfast items like baked beans, eggs, and sausages, and of course that incredible bakery.

Completing this experience was of course a very professional and competent staff.  

Did I say that our room was under 250 euro? How is this deal possible with this level of luxury and service?",5,2010,10,19
29,Beautiful hotel in good location with fantastic service,"Just returned from a long weekend at the Palace hotel. It was wonderful, can't fault it. The public areas were opulent, the rooms extremely comfortable - our bathroom was fantastic- and the service was tremendous. The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2010,10,13
29,"Wonderful hotel, great location, amazing staff","Let me state the obvious right away – this is not a cheap hotel, but you cannot beat the value you get for your money. We stayed in a number of 5-star hotels on our trip, and Barcelona’s El Palace was undoubtedly the best.

We were traveling with a child, and we were driving so we had a a car which can be quite a problem in Barcelona. From the moment we pulled in front of El Palace, the hotel staff took care of us every step of the way! Instead of having us deal with messy narrow underground parking in Barcelona, they parked the car for us every time, and took it out on moments notice. The moment they noticed we’re with a small child (4 year old) they upgraded us to a junior suite. Room was wonderful – quiet and spacious, clean and modern, with jet bath and rain shower, and with an extra bed set up for our boy. Waiting for us was complimentary Cava (Spanish bubbly), and each day on our return to the room we found chocolates which only made every day even better! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful on every step, including making friends with our kid. And lastly, restaurant and scotch bar are hard to beat.

You may have heard that in Barcelona you should stay on La Rambla. Take my advice – do NOT stay there! It is one huge tourist trap, with bad and overprices restaurants, and really nothing you should see... ever. You should explore Barri Gotic and Born areas (which BTW, has some of the best restaurants), and Ports, but stay away from La Rambla.

El Palace is located on large street, so easy to find, but a few blocks detached from over-touristy and over-crowded La Rambla. You’re only two blocks (5 mins on foot) away from Plaza Catalunia and from entrance into Passeig de Gracia, which has both attractions (Gaudi’s houses), great restaurants, and great shopping. Metro station is very close to hotel, so you’re also close to wherever else you want to get to. Even better, taxis in Barcelona are dirt cheap and getting from and to El Palace is trivial, and you won’t have to suffer and pay for stop’n’go crawling through La Rambla. 

Overall, quality of service as well as hotel and room quality made our stay in El Palace absolutely wonderful, and we highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona. Next time we come to Barcelona, we are definitely coming back to El Palace!",5,2010,10,13
29,Excellent Hotel,"A very beautiful, comfortable hotel. 5 star hotel for sure. The location was  excellent and easy to get anywhere. The breakfast was great. The quality of service and accomodations were excellent.  The restuarant recommendations by the staff were perfect.
Taberna da Cura had great suckling pig, and other great dishes. Check out all the Gaudi sights.",5,2010,10,12
29,Friendliest Staff,"Feel free to book this hotel, it was a real positive experience. I would have to say that the staff were the most outstanding feature. Almost everyone was bilingual and easy to communicate with. The concierge staff were the best, offering directions, making reservations etc. 
The room was large and clean with a recently renovated, large bathroom. I loved the location on the Grand Via. It was a 2 - 4 block walk to many desirable spots be they the metro, the Placa de Catalunya or the Bus Turistica. I appreciated that the location was near enough to be convenient but not directly in the busy, noisy main drag. 
If I had to say anything negative, it would be that the breakfast is way over priced but there are numerous breakfast bars within 1 to 2 blocks of the hotel.",4,2010,10,11
29,"excellent, wonderful","The hotel was completely renovated in 2008. The rooms are new, spacious and very comfortable. There is a closet inside the bedroom and the bathroom is quite large. All the equipments (TV, bath, etc) are new and very modern. No doubt a 5 star hotel that deserves this category. I definitely recommend it.",5,2010,10,11
29,"Very comfortable, very quiet and great service!","From the time we stepped out of our car, the service was fabulous. Everyone we dealt with during our stay was friendly and helpful. We had heard great things about the Concierge and they lived up to the high bar that had been set. The rooms were very comfortable and VERY quiet, which made for a good night's sleep.",5,2010,10,07
29,Good Hotel - Not great beds or Internet,"We booked this based on the 2009 upgrade to the hotel, which is impressive.  It's a classic 5 star hotel in the same vein as the Ritz in Madrid, where we also stayed.  Good location, nice rooms,  absolutely the worst Wi-Fi I have ever encountered in 10 years of travel.  It's out of the dark ages.  They partner with a company called Kubli, which while helpful, denied my payment on a limitless AMEX card, through their help line, finally got me connected, since ""they don't work well with FireFox (??)"", and the connection speed then dropped from the standard 54mbps to 8!  I fetched an Ethernet cable from the Consierge, which was free, and here I am.  Also there are no down comforters on the bed and the pillows feel like they are made of kapok (for you young-uns, look it up).  Other than that, it was an enjoyable two night experience.  I will not be back.",3,2010,10,01
29,"Beautiful Hotel, good location","This Hotel is in the perfect location if you are looking for a good place to eat at night, close to Playa Cataluna.

We booked a double room for the two of us and our 3 year old son, we arrived a bit early (11:30am), but we were told they would have our room ready in 15 minutes, which they did. We got an upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The bathrooms in this hotel are amazing.

We didnt eat breakfast here, there are many cafes and bars 5 miuntes walk, just walk down to Playa cataluna and turn right up the main road, here are all the expensive shops and good places to eat.

Excellent Hotel, worth paying that bit extra for the location. Staff are very friendly and can answer all your questions.",5,2010,09,30
29,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"This hotel is definitely worth a visit. The room was lovely (large double with roman bath) and the main hotel areas are also quite grand and very elegant. This is not a contemporary hotel (our usual choice), but was a very nice change and had all the modern comforts, but with a touch of old class.
My only gripe about the hotel was the bar / waiting staff in the main lounge. We waited quite a while to order a drink and in the end gave up as we were ignored until we moved seats. The drinks were also very expensive, and are way above even top London prices. I would recommend this hotel, but find a nearby bar for drinks.",4,2010,09,29
29,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at the Palace from Sept. 8-12. Fantastic. Amazing buffet breakfast with meats, eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruits, and of course sparkling wine. (28 Euro per person). Staff was friendly and prompt. The room was great. Very comfortable bed. The Roman bath was a really fun twist. Location is close to shopping, great restaurants and a short walk to Las Ramblas. This was our 4th trip to Barcelona and we would deffinately go back to the Palace. It truely is beautiful and a top notch hotel.",5,2010,09,28
29,Recently renovated with wonderful features!  Well located!,"We had a great stay!  Our request for adjoining rooms on a high floor were provided without a fuss.  The weather was very hot during our stay and the AC worked well.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The service and quality of appointments were synonomous with other ""Leading Hotels of the World.""  The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of offerings; the champagne mimosa was especially delicious.  Rather than using the expresso machine, I recommend you ask for fresh coffee with hot milk.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Gaudi houses and Catalunya Plaza.  High speed internet is free using an ethernet provided cable.  The flat screen TV is behind the mirror and there are rain fall showers, separate tubs, and sound proofed walls.  Ask for a balcony room on the bloulevard side and in the distance, you can see the spires of La Sagrada de Familia.",5,2010,09,26
29,Excellent Stay with Sophisticated Service,"We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. Hospitable staffs and their sophisticated services supported our pleasant stays. 
Especially, hotel concierge arranged our tickets for flamenco show very speedy and precisely under our request.
If we stayed in Barcelona next time, we would choose this hotel.",5,2010,09,21
29,Top experience,"On my first visit in a few years, I found the former Ritz in great shape after an almost completed and superb renovation.

The location is close to all the major sites but away from the crowds of the Ramblas. As other reviewers have noted, you can sometimes feel that the underground is passing under the hotel but this was not a major issue.

The rooms are large, luxurious and very nicely refurbished. The bathroom with Roman bath (and a large separate rain shower) is one of my favourites anywhere.

The public areas have been refreshed, and lunch next to the hall bar was very good. The other bar will open only in a few months.

Breakfast is a 5-star buffet served in a beautiful covered garden and an experience not to be missed (unusually good service).

The Palace is definitely the best option in Barcelona (I checked out the new Mandarin Oriental for a drink in the garden, and I was shocked by the poor service). With a good fitness / spa / pool, the Palace could be among the best European city hotels.",5,2010,09,16
29,5 stars in every respect,This is a great hotel and will make all the difference to your stay in Barcelona. The style is Old World opulence but with all the modern amenities. The staff were all very helpful. Nothing even slightly negative to say. Have at least one drink at the bar and breakfast out on the patio.,5,2010,09,15
29,Fantastic Hotel,"I booked two nights at this hotel because I couldn't get into the Hilton Diagonal Mar (where I've stayed before). What a choice! This now officially becomes the best hotel I've ever stayed at. I've been into the Paris Ritz before and this place is more luxurious! It would be a £500 night hotel if it was in Paris or London, I couldn't believe the value that I got. Service was top class, food was excellent and the room was sensational, spotlessly clean with walk in showers, chandeliers and a mirror that becomes a TV which I've never seen anywhere before - a bit gimmicky maybe but very clever. The dining room is magnificent as is the bar area - its pricy in the bar but to be expected really. The location in the centre of the town is great, of course you are away from the beach and there is no pool, although the beach isn't too far away. If you're in Barca for sightseeing or business you really can't do better.

One tip - there is more than one Palace Hotel in Barcelona - in fact I think there are three - so write the address down and show it to the taxi driver before he sets off as you could end up at the wrong address - as I did on one occasion.",5,2010,09,09
29,I loved El Palace in Barcelona and this is why...,"The service was impeccable! There was not even one exception. Everybody was so professional, helpful and polite! Special mention to Alexis the multilingual concierge guy. From the moment we stepped in, he was so courteous, discreet, professional really the perfect person to be there! All porters have also been so polite. 
Breakfast is one of the best we’ve ever had in a 5 star hotel. The breakfast area is gorgeous! 
The hotel location is just perfect, most of Barcelona sights area short and pleasant walk away.
I cannot rate this hotel with less than 5 stars even though there are clearly some parts of the hotel which are not finished yet… I think that by the end of the year when the jazz bar will open it will be so nice!
One think to keep in mind if you want to visit other cities around Barcelona, is that the hotel does not have good deals with car rental companies so they are charging too much. The good thing is that 200 m down the road there is a europcar office and we rented a nice small car for 25 euros per day!",5,2010,09,08
29,What a GREAT find!!,"The Palace was such a great find!!  I booked the Ritz by the water and last minute I changed to the El Palace and I am happy I did!!!!   I wanted to stay close to everything and not by the water. The location is great from Las Ramblas.   True about the taxi drivers- we got dropped off at the wrong hotel at first and when taking taxi’s around make sure to bring the hotel’s address b/c they don’t about it.  The front desk staff was great, concierge was the best at helping us with our dinner reservations.  The hospitality was great!!  Our room was ready for us after checking in and we were on the top floor with a small balcony over looking the city.  For what I can see the renovation was complete and everything looked beautiful.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The rain shower is a nice touch.   Also some of the best water pressure I’ve experienced.  The one thing my husband didn’t like was that the tv was in the mirror and placed a little too high so when you have to change the channel you have to stand up and reach high to change it.  I would have loved wi-fi in the room and a softer bed……This did not hurt our stay at all.  When I come back to Barcelona I’m going to at El Palace again!!",5,2010,09,04
29,Barcelona home you would like to come back,"Though they are still in the middle of refurbishment, we did not notice/hear anything. We booked Classic room, but got upgraded to Junior suite. Spa was not ready in August 2010, so that was a slight minus. Reception, bell persons are very helpful, though we found concierge staffs are incredibly arrogant. No internet access in the room. Drainage problems with the bathtub. We think they have still a lot to finalise, but overall our stay was comfortable.",4,2010,09,02
29,Doesn't get better than this,"This hotel is splendid.  Gorgeous rooms, stunning lobby.  Very ornate, so if you like a sleek modern look it is not the place for you.  Concierge staff is FABULOUS.  Perfect location.  Much quieter than the Las Ramblas.  Just perfect.",5,2010,08,21
29,Renovation completed.  Even taxi drivers don't know it.,"Stayed for 3 nights.  Taxi drivers always got confused because there are so many hotels in the area with ""Palace"" in it's name.  Just make sure you tell them the address.  Not so many drivers know it was the former Ritz Hotel either.  Hotel is almost done with the renovation.  The Reception desk area was just finishing when I was checking out (temporary desk was set next to the concierge before).  But no issues with the service, it was all excellently run.  Concierge helped me before and during my stay and offered great advice and service.  Room was large and kept clean.  Showers, tub, faucets and everything run well (and brand new just after the renovation).  Even though the building is old, no need to be scared of a century old plumbing system as in other European old 5 star hotels.  Nice large bed too.  The subway seems to run right underneath the hotel and made some noise/rumble every time it passed under us, but was not such a nuisance.  Much better than police car sirens and car alarms that go off every 10 minutes in NY or other large cities.  Staff were excellent in all areas, maybe because they are former Ritz employees?  You can easily spot top level skill and pride among the staff in an excellent hotel, and it's evident here at El Palace.  Just one thing.  The TV in the framed mirror is a nice idea, but it sporadically seems to freeze up when trying to change the channel.  Maybe the reception or the remote is not so good?  But I like the idea because it keeps the room in line with the elegant, classic atmosphere of the hotel.",5,2010,08,20
29,"Great, Service, Room, Hotel and Value","We booked our three night visit after reading rave reviews on Trip Advisor.  This is another one of those great reviews.  The hotel, formerly the Ritz- Barcelona, has recently been renovated.  We took advantage of a great, last minute deal on a junior suite.  The room was A+ from top to bottom.  The breakfast buffet was the best one we saw during our three week European tour.  The location is superb, close to everything.  Best of all was the excellent service.  Get ready for a great hotel experience at El Palace!",5,2010,08,07
29,One of the best!,"I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world but never at ""The Palace."" The recent renovation of the hotel was very well done, our rooms was spacious, the bathroom wonderful,(my wife's description) and the decor was very tastefully done.  It is the type of elegant hotel that I adore and would highly recommend it for anyone.  It was within easy walking distance of many attractions as well as shopping.  On my return to Barcelona, it will be my preferred place to stay",5,2010,08,02
29,A Trip To Remember,The El Palace hotel is a spectacular hotel in Barcelona Spain that gives you an experience of a life time. I was sincerely impressed with the service and helpfulness of the staff. Everybody was always asking if they could do something for us or weather we were okay. If you are going to go to Barcelona make sure you stay at the El Palace hotel. If you are travelling with kids and you get everyone in one room ask for joining rooms as well as a view no matter what type of room you are staying in.,5,2010,07,30
29,"Great Location, on the pricey side.","Our stay at El Palace was wonderful.  It is a short walk from Las Ramblas and the shopping district.  It is near a few Metro stations, making it easy to navigate Barcelona.  It was a bit pricier than other options, and for this reason, I would probably stay in a less expensive hotel on future visits.  That being said, the hotel room was large, with a spacious walk-in closet and large, renovated bathroom.  (I don't know what I'd find elsewhere). 

We chose this hotel b/c of the positive reviews and we were celebrating our honeymoon, so decided to ""splurge"".  We were not disappointed at all, the service was exceptional, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was great.  Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2010,07,26
29,A true 5 star Barcelona hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in July. Had also considered staying at the Mandarin Oriental and the Hotel Arts, but was so pleased to have chosen this hotel. As you will have read the hotel has been recently refurbished. Our bedroom (standard king) was beautiful and finished to a top luxury standard, with heavy doors, plush seats and a fantastic bathroom. Loved the walk in rain shower, excellent water pressure. Room was large, with a walk in wardrobe and long entry corridor. Bathrobes provided. Excellent Loewe TV with good selection of channels. Soundproofing was excellent and we could not hear any noise from the corridor or other rooms. Lovely small balcony which we could stand on.

The public areas are equally beautiful, with a huge luxurious bar/reception room. Excellent service here and throughout the hotel. We didn't try breakfast due to the cost (32 Euros/person). There main restaurant looked fantastic and I believe it has a Michelin star. Free internet available in the rooms.

I am sure once they complete all the renovations (I believe they are building a pool and second bar) this hotel will be the best in Barcelona.",5,2010,07,25
29,Truly Wonderful!!!,"A beautiful, elegant hotel with spacious rooms and a wonderful staff. As well traveled New Yorkers, we truly appreciated the spacious & comfortable rooms, high ceilings and the fantastic bathroom! As an interior designer they made fantastic choices!  The staff was extremely receptive in the right way...always accomodating when need be. The most noticed aspect was the sound proof doors that lead to our terrace. We were on the 3rd floor and had a beautiful view of the city, yet when the doors were closed ou could not hear a peep. Not even the celebrating Holland win for the semi-finals. It is more of a traditional hotel mixed with some contemporary touches in the rooms with modern bathrooms with the right luxuries. Perfect location...can walk everywhere within 5-15minutes/ catch the local buses. A real find!!",5,2010,07,17
29,Exactly what every upscale heritage hotel should be like,"Newly renovated in exquisite taste, with a very convenient location and excellent personalized service, El Palace is a gem. Our room was absolutely comfortable, roomy, with a lovely view of the city. My husband and I are frequent travelers, both for business and pleasure. Seldom do we encounter such a lovely hotel. Will definitely come back next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2010,07,07
29,Outstanding visit,"Excellent location, large room with great bathroom, fabulous amenities, great balcony, wonderful restaurant, elegant common areas, meticulous and accommodating housekeeping staff, competitive room rate, knowledgeable concierge and bell staff.",5,2010,07,01
29,Awesome Renovation,"The renovation of this hotel has produced some awesome rooms.  I really like the bathrooms where the shower has this large plate stuck to the ceiling which produces something resembling a rainshower.  I also like the separate entrance into the shower from the bathtub - that make sense even though no one else (to my knowledge) designs their bathrooms that way.  The TV within the mirror is also a nice touch.  The amenities are also first rate (L'Occitane).

My only nit is that they don't give you a chocolate when they turn down your bed nor do they provide free wi fi service.  Oh, by the way, they also attach your room key to a huge monster tassle with a brass cap.  Now really - how convenient is it to put that huge thing in your pocket or purse?

Overall though, this is an excellent hotel.",5,2010,06,30
29,An Oasis of calm and comfort: the luxury of a lost age!,"PROS

The hotel was gloriously luxurious and immaculate throughout, all in splendid 19th Century style.
Our room was enormous (we got a free upgrade to a Junior Suite) and extremely plush and comfortable. The bed was vast; there were two huge tvs (with lots of English channels) , separate hallway, two bathrooms, amazing rain shower & jacuzzi bath, etc.
The staff were all very friendly, and the concierge so helpful with all sorts of questions we had about the city. None of that snootiness one can sometimes come across expensive hotels.
The hotel was perfectly situated right in the centre of the City.

CONS
None I can think of!

SUMMARY
We felt truly well looked after, and hardly wanted to leave the hotel at all. This is 5-star living at its very best, and I'm sure this will soon be the number one hotel in Barcelona.",5,2010,06,26
29,Remarkable hotel with good location,"Quite expensive if you take it in the full price, but still very good hotel.
The room is well designed and big and the king size bed is very comfortable.",5,2010,06,17
29,A beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Excellent service from the start, where the consergiere took care of our luggage and requests efficiently. The first thing that striked us was the beautiful decoration of the hotel. Our room was very stylish and romantic. The comfort of the bathroom was excellent, and the cleaning of the room perfect.

The breakfast was superb with numerous choices for every taste, and a beatiful setting in the garden.

Thank you El Palace Hotel for making our honeymoon memorable!",5,2010,06,13
29,"Newly refurbished, beautifully done","I was traveling throughout spain w my parents and stayed at the palace for 5 days in early June. The hotel has gone under a recent facelift, and I think they did a great job. There is a perfect blend between modern touches and classic style. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. The bathroom alone is worth the stay. Best rain shower EVER! Location is great, only a few blocks from La Rambla. Concierge was also quite helpful in helping w dinner reservations. All his recommendations were good. Did not partake in the breakfast, but at 30+ Euros per person, I dont know who would! Free wired internet was a plus.",5,2010,06,07
29,Fanatastic,"My daughter and I have an annual trip each year and the Palace Hotel certainly added to our experience this year. It is reminiscent of a lost age of luxury service and general beauty. The location is perfect for site seeing and shopping. The staff were extremely polite and helpful, and we enjoyed a great dinner there on our last night - perhaps a little expensive, but then so is Barcelona and for the surroundings and the service it was worth every Euro. The bar in the evening is a perfect antedote to the busy streets and sites of daytime, and the Gin and Tonics are a work of art! If ever I was returning to Barcelona I would return to the Palace/Ritz",5,2010,05,27
29,Charming and enchanting,"The old Ritz Barcelona preserves the same atmosphere and magical elegance it had at the begining of the century, coupled with the amenities of modern life.  It is not a hotel for business travelers, but it is a wonderful spot to be pampered and enjoy the luxury.  Service from hotel personnel is superb with the personalized attention you'd expect from a hotel of this category.",5,2010,05,26
29,Still working out the kinks,"The hotel is undergoing renovations and had a ""soft opening"" of its completed rooms a few months back, promising its guests that they would not be inconvenienced except for the limited  space and restaurant service.  During our two night stay in late April 2010, the telephone in our bathroom rang several times during the night (apparently a wiring mix up of some sort) and the power in our room went out completely on one occasion.  We did not receive so much as an apology for either of these inconveniences.  The internet in the entire hotel was not working during our stay - - neither wired nor wireless,  guest rooms nor business center - - although at various times we were told that one or other was working only to traipse downstairs for a wire that turned out to be useless or to the business center, likewise useless.  The hotel is gorgeous and the renovated rooms are enormous and luxurious.  If they can get the kinks worked out, I would be happy to stay there again.",4,2010,05,03
29,Extremely comfortable,"Elegant and a truly nice hotel. Newly renovated, so very nice rooms.
A former Ritz hotel, so the decor is ostentatious and 19th century .. BUT in a very good way.
The hotel is placed right at the border between the ""fancy"" part of the Rambla and the old part of the city. So do be prepared to do some walking.

The staff was polite and friendly.",5,2010,05,03
29,"Beautiful hotel, Great location","Four days of sight seeing in Barcelona.  This was the perfect hotel.  From the prior reviews and pictures on the internet the hotel has obviously been redone.  Our room was state of the art down to the motion sensor to turn on a night light if you got up at night.  The restaurant was pricey  100 euro for salad, water and an entree, but all of Barcelona is pricey.  Service was as grand as the hotel and the location is about as good as it gets.  Center of town, many near by restaurants (try Moo, it is superb).  The only problem is the hotel is built on the subway line and about every 2 minutes there is a very deep rumble that can be heard throughout the entire building (even on the sixth floor).  We did not really find it a problem and is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel even thought it is a small problem.",5,2010,04,14
29,"The staff was very helpful and the room very clean, great location.","The hotel was close to the metro station and many of the major sites.  It was in a very nice part of town, my daughter and I felt safe walking around the area.  The hotel staff were friendly and gave good recommendations for dinner and places to see.  We stayed there for the first couple nights of our trip, left to tour others parts of Spain and came back.  The hotel was able to store a duffle bag for us until we returned.  I was amazed how quiet the hotel was especially being in the middle of the city.  The hotel also smelled really good and had really, really nice bathrooms.",5,2010,04,10
29,Hotel El Placa,"Even though there was some unanswered questions that we asked before our stay I find the overall quality very satisfying.

Me and my girlfriend spent three nights there and the rooms and the hotel looks just like a old five star hotel in the historical town of Barcelona should.  We didn't find the hotel at first, but the concergie gladfully guided us through the town until we stood at the front.  Then he came out and greeted us.

The bedroom has high sealing and with a window and huge curatins hanging down in front of a french balcony.

The breakfast was very good, and had something for everyone, from dimsum to bread and croissants.  And the fresh pressed juices was great.  It's served outdoor and will for sure be even nicer in the summer (with roof and heating we didn't notice that we were outdoor before a bit later).

However, the service from the staff was great.  We were on a somehow tight budget (at least as visitors on a five star hotel) but they gladfully gave us tips on different ranges of restaurants.  The restaurants was ok, and much better than the ones we tried out on ourself, without any tips.

There's a buddaish restaurant serving really great Beef (not sure if that is to be ironic or not..) right around the corner.  Good to know until the last part of the hotel all finished fixed up, as their restaurant is closed. 

We did not see or hear the people working with finishing the last part of the Hotel.  We did not even see which part of the hotel it was.

If I was rich, I would prefer that the breakfast always was included in the price, so you do not have to be bothered by giving your roomnumber under the breakfast.. no big thing, but found it a bit weird.  And no wireless internet? But wired in the room.

Summed up, a great hotel, very good price for the quality (may raise it after its all completed and theyve been open for a while).  The service was very firendly and everyone seemed to like their job and their visitors:)

Gracias",5,2010,04,08
29,A Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at this elegant hotel six years ago and were pleased.  The hotel has been refurbished with new furniture, new bathrooms, new carpets, and fresh paint.  

You can pamper yourself in the large beautiful rooms and comfortable beds.

The staff is helpful and the location for walking is great.",5,2010,03,28
29,Elegant 5 star hotel within walking distance to everywhere,"My husband just returned from staying at the El Palace for 4 nights.  The hotel is still in the ""soft opening"" stage; as a result of it, it is very quiet.  During our stays, we rarely saw other guests.  Staffs were very friendly.  We got a newly renovated room on the top floor (6th floor).  The room was very spacious.  The bathroom has double vanity (horray!), separate bath and shower + the toilet was in a room by itself.  

The cons of the hotel:
a) we were on the 6th floor and can still hear the subway/metro when it passes under the building. I can only imagine how much louder it would get if the room were on the lower floor

b) it is within walking distance to all the major attractions.  However, it is still a bit of a walk.  During the day, it's totally fine walking everywhere.  But at night time, after you have a large meal and drinks, it becomes a hike at 11pm/12am.  We spent 2 nights at Hotel Neri which was right off La Rambla.  It was def nice to be able to get home within 3 minutes after a night out.

The pro, of course, would be that you get a very clam haven after a hectic day out in Barcelona.

Overall, highly recommended if you don't mind walking....",4,2010,03,24
29,brilliant place for a romantic trip to Barcelona,"Just stayed with my husband at the Palace and loved every minute of it. We were celebrating our anniversary. We loved staying in one of the new rooms of the Palace. Staff is friendly and helpfull, rooms are lovely, bathroom is super. The hotel is being renovated but we didn't hear a thing. The parts that are ready are very done in style. Prices are really nice during renovation.",5,2010,02,03
29,A Grand and Elegant Hotel,"As I have worked for a major U.S. airline for many years I have been lucky enough to stay in some of the worlds  leading hotels.  On our latest vacation to Barcelona, my husband and I had the good fortune to stay at the newly renovated Palace Hotel (formerly known as The Ritz.),  We recommend this grand and elegant hotel  to anyone who wants to experience old world  charm, elegance and excellent service.  The Palace Hotel is one of the best of the best and the staff goes out of their way to meet their customer's needs.  We wil be back!",5,2009,11,04
29,soft reopening of grand european hotel,"Having chosen the Palace Hotel for our Barcelona stay, I was a bit concerned about it's ""soft opening"" with completion of lobby, restaurant, and most floors of rooms continuing for the next few months. I wasn't disappointed. Our room was well appointed and spacious and the staff was very helpful. Although there are kinks to be ironed out in the coming months, this hotel has the potential to be one of Europe's finest. Having just arrived from Lyon, I will say that my only disappointment was Barcelona's food.",4,2009,10,09
29,Faded Glory,"Faded grandeur, but we had a junior suite with two bathrooms that was very large and clean for a reasonable price, with a nice breakfast included. The hotel is very convenient for sight seeing.",3,2008,07,02
29,Superb Hotel,"We had a Junior Suite at the Palace Hotel, which was very beautiful and spacious.  The bathrooms were made of orange marble.  The service was outstanding.  Their brakfast buffet is unequaled in quality and variety, and the maitre d' is the best!  Our entire family was very pleased with the stay.  I should add that the location is also very convenient.  Fully recommend this hotel.",5,2008,02,12
29,A classic hotel,"Great location just blocks away from Las Ramblas on the Gran Via de les Corts - a quick and direct taxi ride from the airport.. Old world style and class at this hotel, including great beds and linens in spacious rooms furnished with antiques. Soon to undergo renovation; one hopes the changes will be minimal.  A great place to stay in a lovely city.",5,2007,11,07
29,DO NOT GO HERE...shutting down in 2 weeks for TWO YEARS!,"I just checked in today....and couldn't waste any time to post this review with the hope of saving someone else from a HUGE mistake in staying here!

The staff is NOT professional, and are only trying to buy time for the next two weeks before they shut down for TWO YEARS! No one greeted us, no one had a smile. The carpet is totally all torn on the stairs...NO KIDDING...our room had pillows with blood stains...NO KIDDING...the seams in the carpet in the entry of the door to our room were all torn...NO KIDDING...there were dirty black finger prints all over the bathroom door handles form the inside...NO KIDDING...and the windows had face prints all over them from the previous guest...NO KIDDING...and no bars of soap in the bathroom at all...NO KIDDING. When I asked to talk to the manager...the response was ""there is no manager"" on weekends, only the housekeeping manager...and when I talked with him...he told me I am in THE best room...NO KIDDING!

They tried to wash the wall, brought us two new pillows and some bars of soap...and not even a gentle apology or acknowledgement of the grosteque situation...NO KIDDING!

Yes, we are talking about the same hotel...and I travel a lot...and am NOT a picky traveler. These are things you do not have to even think about for a 5+ hotel (and they are listed in the Luxury Hotels of the World as well). 

After a bit more discussion with the ""manager"" come to find out they are shutting down in 2 weeks...so the staff that is here is obviously the bare minimum. 

PLEASE...tell everyone you know so that they cancel their reservation!!!!!

I even have photos I plan to post later...NO KIDDING!",1,2007,10,06
29,rude staff,"Grand old hotel but the staff was horrendously rude. 
 Rooms are huge and the bathrooms lovely. The entrance to the room was charming.

Whenever I have stayed at this caliber of hotel the staff know you and greet you but here they ignored us and were unecessarily rude.",3,2007,09,26
29,Great service but very tired,"Stayed for 3 nights for my wife's birthday.

Great Location for shopping, the port and sightseeing. 

All the staff were very helpful and polite and focused on making our stay enjoyable. Excellent breakfast buffet with lots of choice.

Main disappointment is the decor of the rooms, which truly does need the refurbishment that is promised in November. Bathroom also needed work and the shower was not what I expect from a good quality hotel.  

If you are prepared to put up with those shortcomings its a fine example of a 'Grand European Hotel'.",4,2007,09,25
29,Old fashioned grandeur,"We've just come back after a few days at the Palace and loved it.  Is some of the grandeur faded?  Probably.  They are about to start a refurbishment programme and my wife and I both hope that this doesn't detract from the magic of the place.

Old fashioned room - but huge.  Everything worked perfectly for us. The staff were very friendly and everyone speaks English.

The hotel is about 5 mins from Las Ramblas and 20 mins from the Port Area.  We loved it and would stay again tomorrow.
",5,2007,08,18
29,Barcelona's grand old lady,"Coming back to our quiet room at the Palace after long days of sightseeing was a pleasure. The bed was very comfortable, and there were always plenty of big, thick towels in the bathroom, along with bathrobes. 
 
The staff was very helpful in booking tours and anything else we needed. English speaking staff members were always on duty.

I will definitely stay there again.
",5,2007,08,15
29,Totally overrated,"I definitely would not stay in this hotel again.  I think it probably was fabulous in its day - the rooms are large (we had adjoining ones), the lobby is lovely, and when it was a Ritz maybe it was great.  But it is way past it's prime.  The toilets wobbled, the elevators are slow, the smell of smoking was unacceptable even in non-smoking rooms, and it was very dusty.  What they need is a major remodel.  Definitely not a five star hotel no matter what the Spanish goverment says.
",2,2007,07,24
29,overall dissapointing,"Elegant, spacious rooms, however the smell of tobacco was unbearable. It takes forever to get a shower (almost impossible) since the water temperature cannot be fixed; it is either scalding or icy. There is an adjacent Ritz hotel ( on the side street) which looks brand new  and classy, but not advertised anywhere. 
Definitely not staying here again.
",2,2007,05,29
29,"Very grand, impressive hotel","We have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona.  We were booked into the Husa Oriente but less than 24 hours before were informed that our hotel had technical problems and we had to be relocated.  They had moved us to the Palace Hotel, formerly the Ritz.  There were eight in our party, including 4 teenage children, split into 4 rooms.  Although the change was a little worrying we were pleasantly surprised.  The Palace is a very grand hotel, the rooms are enormous, 2 spacious bathrooms with seperate w.c. per bathroom, good showers, very good maid service.  The reception staff were very helpful, arranging taxis, recommending restaurants, giving directions etc.  
The hotel has a lot of history (read the book in the room), in the middle of a busy old city, it is not a modern Las Vegas hotel so don't go there if that is what you are looking for in a hotel.
Use the metro, easy to get to, cheap to use, don't use the turistic bus on a Sunday - too many queues. Highly recommended for a city break.
",5,2007,05,04
29,Disappointing and Overpriced,"The public rooms of the hotel were superficially impressive, but the furniture was sad and in need of replacement.  Likewise for our guest rooms, which were large and furnished with antiques, but were tired and in need of renovation in critical ways.  The beds and pillows were second rate.  The bathrooms were worse, including a plastic tub and smelly drains in the sinks.  The concierges sent us to a tourist trap of a restaurant  and were unhelpful in trying to arrange a tour of a site in the city.
",2,2007,04,18
29,Fabulous Hotel Palace Barcelona!,"I just returned as a solo traveler to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Palace in early April 2007.  After much research, I was delighted with my choice and would stay at this property again.  The service was amazing...all employees pleasant and eager to make your stay most comfortable.  I decided on the breaksfast plan which was well worth the cost.  A full and fresh breakfast offered in an elegant dining room.  The room was beautiful!  It was large and very comfortable.  The maid service was excellent....very clean room and bathroom with service twice a day.  After my arrival, a staff member arrived with a bottle of wine and chocolates.  I felt very safe in this hotel. The lobby was wonderful and very inviting to sit and read and to enjoy social moments.  It was centrally located to all the famous sights of Barcelona.  I can honestly say, there was not one issue or slight complaint I had with this hotel.  A perfect holiday in Barcelona at the Hotel Palace!!
",5,2007,04,09
29,Faded Beauty But I'd Still Recommend It,"We stayed at The Palace over Easter weekend 2007 and I would thorougly recommend it! The decor in the rooms is a bit beyond its best and shabby around the edges, but everything is provided and the rooms are enormous, with massive bathrooms. The reason I'd really recommend this hotel though is the service - the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. All the staff speak fluent English - even the chamber maids - and they were incredibly friendly, approachable and helpful. Our TV remote batteries died - there was someone at the door with fresh ones almost the second we'd hung up the phone to ask for them. My boyfriend wanted to know the score in a football game happening in England - the concierge checked on the internet for him right away. We wanted a restaurant recommendation - the concierge not only made several recommendations, but left a note in our pigeon-hole with their addresses and directions. In every situation, they did their absolute utmost to help us, and always graciously and with good humour. We would definitely stay again, so what if the carpets are a bit faded?
",4,2007,04,09
29,Old school class,"I stayed in the Palace hotel for 4 days, as a birthday present for my brother. As we arrived, we took a very cheap bus that stopped very close to the hotel. As soon as we got out, a bell boy came to take our luggage and escorted us to the reception. We were upgraded from a regular room to a junior suite, without any extra costs or a reason at all. The breakfast buffet was amazing (we didn't eat at the hotel at any other time) with cava (spanish champagne) and strawberries! (and off course all kinds of pastry, bread, fruit, hot and cold foods) When my brother had an accident, we were brought to the hospital (he broke his hand) and the concierge provided the medicins etc. he had to use. They were very helpfull, and were fully at our service. Faboulous!
",5,2007,02,25
29,Classic & Elegant,"We're just back from a short break from 1/2 - 3/2. We choose this hotel based from its 5 star rating and its location which is very near to Plaza Catalunya. Although there are other 5 star hotels which is in that area ie Le Meridian & Hotel Majestic -  we didn't like both the hotel's room deco (based from hotel pics) and  it is slightly more expensive that this Palace Hotel and so we decided to book this hotel. We got a good rate from the hotel's website [-] at the rate of euro190 & euro170 for 2 nite 

Compared with both hotels (we did check out both of them) we love Palace Hotel much better. The deco of the hotel's lobby & restaurant are so exquisite.  Here's the details:-

ROOM
The room is really huge for a standard room - about 38m2. Which far bigger than the other 5 star hotels. As soon as you enter, there are a hallway that leads to the bathroom on the right and the bedroom straight ahead. Very comfortable King bed  with 2 comfortable wide pillows and 2 square pillows. 2 sofa and a coffee table in front of the main windows. Flat tv and a walking closet!! we certainly didn't expect that at all - although the deco is a bit simple, it should have more of flowers and some more furniture since the room is huge. The furniture in the bedroom are sheer exquisite antiques, which you rarely find in other modern hotels these days. However, lack of sound proof actually lets us down - we can actually hear footsteps from the room upstairs. Luckily, they (guest on the room upstairs) check outs after the 1st nite so we were lucky. I think because of the age of the buiding (which is built in 1919) they needs to improve the sound proofing and the reception did explain to us that they are planning to do the renovation to improve the problem - starting nxt July 07.  Yes, the carpeting and the bathroom is a bit outdated but it did nothing to prevent us from having a good time.
Contrast from previous review -- we did not have any problem with the shower.  It was overall good.

LOCATION
The hotel is sitiuated in the corner lot, in front of the main road Gran Via which can be bit noisy with lack of sound proof
Main attractions - 
Plaza Catalunya and La Ramblas is just 10 minutes walk , about 2 blocks away. We always had a nice walk from and to the hotel, as the area is very well cared for with lots of shops. It was great to stay away from the hotel in La ramblas area as it can be quite busy sometime and more  area to walk and explore. Take the Touristic bus which has stop at the Plaza catalunya - it is essential in Barcelona as the city is really huge. 
Passage De Gracia - main street for shopping is just 10 mins walk

STAFF & SERVICE
I would give 10/10 to the service given by their staff. They are absolutely fantastic. When we arrived at the hotel, the bell boy - Louis showed us tour of the hotel - the restaurants and everything you need to know about the guest room

BREAKFAST
I would say the Diana restaurant which is the breakfast room is an absolute stunner - it felt like having a breakfast in a park! The rate didn't include breakfast but we decided to check out the breakfast - it was a bit pricey at 21 euro per person but worth it. There are lots of choices to choose from - 2 types 0f spanish omelletes, scrambled eggs, baked beans, sausages, choices of breads, fruits, cereals and even a special breakfast area especially for diabetic

Although we had a great time but I think we would't stay again at this hotel, just simply because lack of the sound proof but we might check it out after they had finished their renovation.

29,"Great Location, Unfriendly, Inhospitable Front Desk","My wife and I travelled to Barcelona to stay at the Ritz at the end of November.  The good: It is a beautiful old hotel with an incredible location.   The doorman and the bellhops were very helpful and friendly.  The rooms have a lot of great character that one would expect from a grand old hotel.
The bad: While the doorman and bellhops were friendly, the front desk was not as hospitable.  They were unfriendly and rude during check in. And at check out, after having spend 5 nights, they insisted that someone made a call from our room and we would have to pay for it.  We proved to the mean lady at the front that we were at the Palau Nacional (beautiful venue) at the time of the call and clearly one of the maids/hotel workers had made the call from our room during turn-down service.  After having spend 5 nights, she was insistent on the 3 euro charge and was very rude.
One experience like this can lend a bad taste to an entire vacation.  With so many other great hotels in Barcelona, I will never stay at this hotel again nor recommend it to any of my friends.  I hope the 3 euros was worth it to the hotel.

29,Excellent stay at the Palace,"Booked through special offer on Travelzoo.  Went for a room rather than taking free upgrade to a suite as was told that these had no windows and we like a view.

Fabulous frontage, reception, lounge etc with groovy chandeliers and all very nicely decorated for Christmas.

Huge, high room, about the floor space of our entire downstairs, massive comfy bed and large bathroom with freebie toiletries, slippers & nice thick towelling robes.

Staff and concierge all very helpful and friendly. Chose to have a lie-in rather than breakfast which was £15 pp, better to go a cafe locally if on a budget.

Only tiny problems - had to remind about our welcome cava & chocs which then arrived promptly and a little noise from the road and Metro but we live in the country so prob most people wouldn't even notice. The flatscreen telly looked so incongruous in what was once the Ritz!

Overall very pleasant and comfortable stay, excellent position for walking to Ramblas, old town in one direction or La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia etc in the other. Loads of bars & restaurants every where.",5,2006,12,22
29,Worst shower ever,"Very nice old hotel. Beautiful lobby.
But the shower was a disaster, if you can call it a shower. it was basically a showerhead with a drain to catch the water, no walls, so you freeze as you're taking a shower....until the water starts to flip out on you, first it scalds you, then it freezes you, then it goes back to giving you 3rd degree burns on 80% of your body.

29,Old World Elegance,"We just returned from a short stay at this elegant property.  Everything that I've read here on Trip Advisor has been correct.  The location of the hotel was great.  It's only a few short blocks to the Las Ramblas and the tourist buses.  The doorman, David was a wonderful help to us.  He was able to recommend a great place to tapas, shopping and touring.  He was a wealth of information and since he was from the US, he spoke fluent English!

The hotel itself brought one back in time to the era in which it was built (1919).  Yes, they needed an update on bedding and the windows were not exactly soundproof, but the benefits outweighed the detriments.  All the staff were courteous and efficient.  Once a few little updates are completed, it will be a wonderful place to stay!

29,nothing to complain,"stayed there in october. 
The location is good, because an underground-garage is near, you can reach it easily and it´s only a ten minutes walk to the very heart of the town, and five minutes to the area where you find many nice shops and several buildings of gaudi.
The building is a typical turn of the century hotel in a style you would await in a palace. the ground floor rooms are magnificent in a vaguely french style as in all ritz hotels and well maintained.
Our room was although only an ordinary one big with a comfortable bed, the usual fittings including a marble mantlepiece. 
The bathroom was tiled with pink marble. i´ve seen this before in josephine baker´s house and that comes to me when i say ritzy. unfortunately a cheap restauration took place and parts of the former golden-coloured plumbing were replaced by chrome, but only parts. as i am no decorator, i could use it as well.
room service was fast, efficient and friendly. isolation from the noise outside is very efficient.
we would stay there again.

",4,2006,10,28
29,Fantastic hotel with great service,"I too was worried that I had made an incorrect choice after reading some of the reviews but after contacting the hotel beforehand they assured me that although the renovations would not start until 2007 we would be allocated a very nice room. The building itself is so impressive - in particular the Hall Bar/Lounge and the entrance. We had booked the standard deluxe room and it was spotlessly clean, full of antique furniture, a huge huge bed (very very comfortable), robes, slippers etc. The blackout linings at the window were excellent and we heard very little noise - it certainly did not disturb our sleep. Breakfast was excellent - every choice you could think of and omelettes and eggs made to order. The Hall Bar service was excellent. 

I would certainly return - because of the wonderfully central location and the facilities offered. The room service was the quickest room service I have experienced. Try ""Little Italy"" restaurant on the street opposite on the other side of the Gran Via (live jazz with excellent food). If you like traditional decor and furnishings you can't beat it - if you prefer modern 'cold' hotels don't stay here.
",5,2006,10,10
29,A wonderful experience!,"After reading several disappointing reviews, we were concerned about the reservation we had made for this property.  We contacted the hotel directly and were informed that renovation would be starting the month after we would be here.  I saw on Trip Advisor that some of the rooms had been renovated, but not all of them.  We were assured that we would be well taken care of and decided to stick with our reservation.  Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a mini suite and it was beautiful and spacious.  The bed was larger than king size and was entered through double doors off the living room.  There was a walk-in closet with separate hanging areas  for my husband and myself    -  all paneled in a beautiful cognac colored wood stain.  The bathroom was extremely large with double sinks - a separate glassed in area for the toilet and bidet, and then a large tub and separate shower at the end of the room.  The shower had several different spray heads aimed at various areas of one's anatomy which was great.  We thought the staff was cordial, courteous and personable.  Our only regret was the fact that they were having a wedding reception the night of our arrival and so the main public room was closed off to the hotel guests - but was open the next morning.   We believe it's always a good idea to communicate with your hotels before arrival and have had excellent service and attention when we have done this.  We did hear from other guests that their rooms were not renovated yet, but were large and spacious.  I would add that my husband and I both had massages while we were there and they were two of the best we've ever had!  The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and we were delighted with the choices as well as the service.  The setting was elegant and beautiful.  We will definitely return to this property for not only it's excellent location, but also for the attention and service we received as guests.

29,A Contradictory Review - Faultless Stay!,"I use tripadvisor prior to every trip and post reviews after every trip, so I was getting nervous prior to checking in (having read the previous reviews).  However, our stay was extremely enjoyable.  I had asked for a quiet room on an upper floor prior to our arrival and this was confirmed on checking in.

Room 501 was on an upper floor with a view across Gran Via, it had recently been refurbished and had double-glazing (and an additional inner window, so triple-glazing if we're being pedantic).  I am particular about noise and I can honestly say I slept so soundly I was worried about sleeping past breakfast.

The room was nicely furnished with antiques and re-upholstered furniture - the bathroom in our room did not appear to have been refurbished, but was five star standard.  The bed was spotless and turned-down each night.  Concierge team were excellent, and breakfast was one of the best buffets we've had in a five star hotel.  In light of previous reviews, and based on our experience, I would recommend communicating with the hotel in advance if you have any concerns.
",5,2006,06,05
29,Still a very good hotel,"We stayed here for a week in '04, and the reviews on TripAdvisor since then did give us pause for concern in booking again for Feb. '06.  We visit Europe 4-5 times a year, and always stay in 4-or 5-star hotels, many of them also affiliated with LHW.  

I E-mailed them in November with my concerns about the renovation and the complaints registered here.  I received a prompt E-Mail back, stating that the renovation would not start until later in '06 and we would be assured of a room in fine condition.

We paid 190 Euros/nt for the identical room we had on the sixth floor two years ago. It was great; good bedding, high-quality linens, bathrobes and slippers, nice toiletries, a gift of chocolates and Spanish wine in the room.  Everything was exceptionally clean.  Yes, there were some ""dings"" on the chair by the desk, and a couple of very minor spots on the carpeting.  Planning to write a review here upon our return, I specifically looked for the issues that were noted in previous reviews.  But for the most part, there is very little to criticize.

The service remains exemplary.  The doorman, David (from Pennsylvania) is a gem...  very helpful with directions, recommendations, and a taxi when we needed one.  Both he and the concierege staff remembered us and gave us a warm welcome.  The concierge staff are great...  they provided wonderful restaurant recommendations.  

The location, for us, is ideal...  several great tapas places within a few blocks, 4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas.  With the windows closed, no street noise to be heard at all.

The only thing you have to be careful about is that the taxi drivers still know the hotel as ""the Ritz"", not ""the Palace"".  There are several hotels in BCN with ""palace"" as part of the name, and we were taken to several of them by mistake.   You have to give the driver the name AND street address.... get the hotel's card when you arrive, and provide it to any taxi driver you use.  

Is it the Four Seasons in Istanbul, the Grand Bretagne in Athens, or the Grand Hotel in Stockholm?
No, it is showing a bit of wear.  It needs some TLC to restore its former luster.  But it is still a very well-managed, charming, old-world hotel in a great location in Barcelona.",4,2006,04,08
29,A wonderful experience,"We stayed at the hotel in May pre-cruise, two rooms, one for my wife and son and I, one for my inlaws. My inlaws had a standard room, we had a junior suite. It was a wonderful experience. I will agree that there are some items that will benefit from the curent upgrading--such as the air conditioning system--but it is a beautiful and classic hotel. Our junior suite had two large and perfectly maintained bathrooms and curtains to separate the sleeping and sitting area. When I asked for sheets for the fold out sofa where our son was to sleep, a team from housekeeping arrived and brought a complete mattress to put on top of the pull out mattress so our son would be more comfortable--amazing service. 

My inlaws were delighted with their room as well.

The public areas are spectacular, and the breakfast room is one of the best I have ever seen. This hotel is a jewel, and it just needs a litte shine to return to former glory
",4,2006,03,21
29,"Misses the mark for ""5 star GL""","You can see how this was once ""the hotel"" in Barcelona (when it was The Ritz), and there is still a lot to love here, but it's not all it could be, anymore.  The public spaces are grand, and a lot of the furnishings and fixtures were beautiful antiques, incl. in the room.  Some, however, were too well worn, others not so clean looking (too many fingerprints on elevator doors, windows and headboards) - although the most important items like linens and baths were pristine.  Some updating and attention to details (install modern locks and safes, brighten the room decor, bring back the robes, etc.)would go a long way.

Since we spent 5 days here, we appreciatated the spaciousness of the rooms, the high ceilings, large double vanities,twin closets and comfy king bed.    We had a great view over Barcelona to Mt Tibidabo and La Sagrada Familia from our small terrace on the top floor, and service was efficient and unobtrusive. We actually chose this hotel for its compromise location, on the lower edge of the upscale Eixample area, and while only a few blocks from the center of it all, Plaza de Catalunya, it was far enough from La Rambla's crowds to be quiet and relaxing. However, we found that the Barri Gotic/Born/Old City areas (away from touristy La Rambla)were more enjoyable and unique to Barcelona - and wished we had chosen to stay somewhere there, instead.

",4,2006,03,16
29,Not worth the money,"For the price, it was not worth the money.  The location is reasonable, but I could not get a good night sleep because the mattress was old and soft.  My husband and I would end up sinking towards the middle of the bed while we slept.  When I complained to the hotel they simply shrugged their shoulders and didn't do anything about it.
",2,2006,02,07
29,Stay here after renovations are complete,"This review is coming from a very fussy, self-proclaimed hotel critic.

Well, I don't want to be as harsh as the others but they are mostly right. While the lobby and ""tea room"" are quite lovely, the rooms are not. And that's what you pay for, right? The rooms need an entire overhaul. We stayed in a suite which was a fair size but the furniture was beat-up, the bathrooms needed updating (the porcelain in the tub in one of the bathrooms was coming off). The good news is that the manager said renovations start in January 2006. 

The michelin 1-star rated restaurant, Caelis, was a nice dining experience but the food (nouvelle Catelan fushion?) was a taste which left something to be desired. Very pricey for what we got. Breakfast buffet in the garden room was in a lovely setting with a large selection of basic food offerings.  

It's a great location, walking distance to the Pl. Gracia shopping area and Guadi architectural attractions. Concierge staff was very nice and helpful--not all of our luggage made it and they called the airlines for us a few times daily. 

I highly would recommend staying here AFTER the room renovations have been completed.

29,Was the Ritz now expensive and terrible.,"We went a while ago but it was the same then as it is now by recent reviews. Its sad that a once great hotel has become so derided and fallen. Its a peice of history that when we visited overcharged and under delivered on quality and features. Main one no air con and no room fans and in summer that counts in Barcelona. A real shame but not to be recomended at all. I would imagine its up for redevelopment or closure!
",1,2005,08,13
29,Stay elsewhere for the price,"Stayed here pre-cruise for 1 night.  Found hotel on ""Leading Hotels of the World"" and surprised it was part of that group.  We had a king bed, 2 baths and living room.  The room seemed kinda old and musty.  Sheets and bed about as comfortable as a LaQuinta.  The hotel location is good and buffet breakfast was great.  But I'd rather stay elsewhere for the price.
",2,2005,08,10
29,Does not deserve to be called Ritz,"We stayed there with my wife for 3 nights. Location is good, building is average, service leaves a lot to be desired. The restaurant staff definitely need training to learn what 5 star service should be. After receiving rude service in the restaurant, the hotel manager was very apologetic and arranged for our transfer to the airport for free, which was a nice gesture. However, I would not stay there again. This hotel does not deserve to be called Ritz.
",2,2005,07,17
29,Horrible ...,"The Ritz is certainly not a 5-star hotel nor is it a Leading Hotel of the World! The hotel is run down and dirty. The rooms have air-conditioning that can only be switched on (which makes the room far too cold) or off (unbearabky hot in summer), no adjustment is possible. The so-called gym consists of one machine that is out of order. The service is equally bad. We were planning to stay there for 6 nights but moved out after two nights. Me moved to the Hotel Arts which costs about the same but is much better than the Ritz.
",1,2005,07,10
29,5 star hotel? I don't think so,"My wife and I stayed at Barcelona Ritz for 4 nights during May of 2005. The hotel is worthy of neither the 5 star rating nor The Leading Hotels of The World membership. The property itself is magnificent, with 12 foot ceilings, great lobby and rooms are quite large (about 500-600 sq. feet). 

However, the hotel has not been renovated for quite some time, and especially the bathrooms are in bad shape. The first room we got was a Jr. Suite. It had two small square rooms and felt very compartmentalized. We asked for a single large room and got a decent one. Its carpet was very old and with stains, but otherwise OK. The surprise came when my wife almost got burned in the shower, because the faucet was circa 1950 and there was no way to estbalish consistent flow of hot and cold water.

I asked for a different room. Was shown two, with only one actually having a better bathroom situation. 

The rest of stay was OK, but it was clear that neither hotel nor its staff know what 5 star service is all about.
",2,2005,06,08
29,Disliked the Ritz,"I stayed at the Ritz in a Jr. Suite on May 20th and 21st.  It was the worst room I have ever had.  I asked to be moved and was told they would move me in the morning but they never got around to it.  I called both the reception and the concierge and got no answer at either.  The service was bad and reception seemed to not care.  It was just not me that was dissapointed.  There were several post cruise people staying at the Hotel and everyone except one  did not like their room.  This is not a 5 star hotel as stated.  It  is a two star at best.  The location was good, but I  will never stay there again.
",1,2005,05,28
29,Very disappointing,"We spent a weekend at the Ritz and we're still trying to figure out how it is rated as a five star hotel.On arrival we were informed that our room would not be ready until 4.00pm;a very late check-in time for a luxury hotel.We went to see some of the sights and when we were finally allowed into our room they forgot to bring us our luggage.After waiting forty five minutes I telephoned reception and it was brought to us.
Two days later my wife attempted to book a restaurant through the concierge.She telephoned the concierge desk for fifteen minutes without reply.She then telephoned reception,informed them of the problem and asked them to contact the concierge.The receptionist hung up the telephone while she was explaining the problem.She then telephoned the manager who was apologetic and sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne.It was a nice gesture but we'd prefer good service than good champagne.
Barcelona is a lovely city and we enjoyed ourselves outside the environs of the hotel.We'll visit Barcelona again but we'll avoid the Ritz.",1,2005,05,13
29,Loved the Ritz,"A couple of friends and I stayed at the RITZ in Barcelona April 7-12.
We loved every moment of our stay. Before going there I was afraid 
the hotel would be run down, since it hasn't been renovated for the past years, but it is a lovely hotel, the rooms we were given (which were a couple of their regular rooms) were very BIG, on the sixth floor with a lovely view, with all the aminities of a Grand Hotel, like exquisite bathroom toiletries, lots of crisp linen towels etc., the hotel's buffet breakfast was wonderful and all the people in the hotel were extremely friendly and went out of their way to serve us and please us. I would also like to mention the helpfulness and efficiency of their reservation department. The location of the hotel is ideal and, if you are looking for 
a good hotel with personal service, I would recommend the RITZ highly!",4,2005,04,17
29,This is not a Leading Hotel of the World,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Ritz recently (March 05) and were very disappointed with the service, staff and upkeep of the hotel and rooms.  Claiming to be one of the Leading Hotels of the World, the Ritz has to do a lot more to live up to the name it has bought itself.  Breakfast was served in a very cold environment.  The staff at the hotel did nothing that was extra special.   And to top it off, one of our bags was thrown in the garbage by accident and the hotel public relations manager offered nothing when we said this was unacceptable behavior.  I would highly recommend spending your money elsewhere.
",1,2005,03,07
29,Beware when exiting the Hotel,"I have to say that the hotel definitely offers that old world charm. It is an a great location, within walking distance of all the key locations and shopping. 

The only downfall, is that there are pick-pocket gangs that are targeting guests exiting the better hotels in the city. One of them is the Ritz.  I had my bag snatched just across the street, and the thieves run down to the parking garage and can exit on the other side of the block. I was lucky - my husband and a friend chased them down and managed to get the bag back. The hotel personnel (porters and concieges) witnessed all the commotion and called the police. However, I was disappointed to find out that this is not the first time this has happended outside the Ritz and is a common ocurrence.  The hotel personnel are aware of this problem. Obviously, it tends to be a problem in all major cities, but I do believe that the hotel should warn their guests. Since the hotel is reluctant to ""panic"" the guests with such an advisory, I do think it is important that future guests are informed.

As I was walking, I was tripped from behind... as I reached out to prevent from falling, my bag was snatched. So when you walk out of the hotel, hang on tight to your bag!!!!  They work in two's and tend to hand out just outside that underground garage, right across the street from the hotel. Therefore, do be vigilant from the moment you exit the hotel.
",3,2004,12,09
29,Old World Charm,"From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat.  The Ritz is a classic, old world hotel and has all the charm one would expect from a Ritz hotel.  The keys come with a large tassle--and the Junior Suite was delightful with two full bathrooms and a confortable bed.  The Courtyard did not provide a view--but it was very quiet.  The Restaurant for dinner was outstanding--and while expensive--provided a memorable experience.  Breakfast in Diana's Garden was most pleasant as well.  The hotel has a superb location, just a few blocks from the upscale shopping area.
",5,2004,11,25
29,in one word terrific,"The room was spacious, cosy and comfortable. The hotel service was fine. The breakfast was outstanding, a lot of choices. The hotel was very good. It's located just outside the busy streets and everything is within walking distance. We would stay here again. The price is what you expect of a Ritz Hotel.
",4,2004,11,08
29,Enjoyed our stay,"This is a beautiful older hotel, well maintained, newly renovated, with outstanding details like bronze statues antiques in the rooms, and a fireplace, and it also has the most spectacular breakfast room.  This website has not listed the many references for this hotel for some reason and most will refer to the high prices.  We obtained a very competitive rate at the Hotel Ritz website and it included the wonderful breakfast.  Perhaps if you book far enough in advance as we did, the rates are better.  Our room was upgraded at arrival to one with a roman bath and it was wonderful.  We could not have been more pleased with the staff, the room, and the location.
",5,2004,10,12
29,A bit dissapointed!,"Me and my husband have been at Four seasons Hotel in Lisbon last summer and it was a real pleasure so we desided to choose this hotel for our vacation this summer. We stayed at the hotel in August 2004. We made  our reservation through the same internet source as last year but this time we were not very lucky.
Despite the room was a small junior suite, it was at the first floor with absolutely no view and a terrible noise of the hotel's generator that forced us to keep the windows always closed in the middle of the summer!In the end, they tried to overcharge us with 45 Euros for two contintental breakfasts we didn't have so we had to fight for the truth! 
Next time in barcelona we will be more carefull with our choice..
",2,2004,09,24
29,Average Hotel at a High Price,"For the high price (around $300 per night with a discount), this was an average hotel. It was quite and clean, but I would not stay here again because there are so many more hotels in the area with better locations at more reasonable prices. I stayed at the hotel 7/21/04-7/25/04. When I arrived, the service was courteous, but nothing distinguising. (I had just stayed at the Hotel Ritz in Madrid which was outstanding, but don't confuse this hotel which I booked under ""Hotel Ritz Barcelona"" with the one in Madrid...they are not associated. Now, apparently they call this one Hotel Palace.) The room was a junior suite with a small, hard love seat, a table and a bed. The room was in inside room and it just felt a little gloomy. It was clean, but just lacked any decor. Perhaps I would have asked for a different room, but I just did not feel that the front desk was as personable as other hotels, so I shyed away from making a room change request. Again, everyone was polite, but for the price, I did not feel as if there was that level of personal detail and attention I expected. Everything is extra, so if you ask for bottled water, you'll have to pay. If you're in the lobby in your shorts after sightseeing, be sure they'll wisk you off to your room quicky if there is a formal event occuring in their dining room. The hotel was about six blocks from the old gothic area...not too far, and there are metro train stations nearby, so you can get to places easily. I would recommend you into the Hotel Artz Barcelona (which is right off the water) or look into renting an apartment. All in all, it is a safe and acceptable hotel, but nothing to write home about.

29,Needs investments,Know well Barcelona for coming often on business. Stayed there recently (Dec 03). This hotel has great location but is not worth Leading Hotels of the World brand.

My grandchildren really enjoyed that 24-hour stay. Wonderful breakfast. The spectacular terrace. The guide who showed us the hotel was very friendly and professional. The room according to my 10-year-old granddaughter was Princess's. My grandson enjoyed the bathtub. The professionalism of all the staff was first class, as is the entire Hotel. It was my father's favorite hotel many years ago. Thank you very much for making us feel at home. Raissa Topel",5,2024,04,05
29,Rara avis,"Classic hotel, well located, with highly efficient concierge service.
I particularly appreciated that the requests made beforehand regarding the characteristics of the room were all satisfied immediately, meaning I didn't have to, as happens too frequently, view multiple rooms.
The clean and well-maintained accommodation was equipped with a large hammam-style bathroom.
The breakfast, served on a heated veranda, was in line with the standards of a five-star luxury hotel in terms of quality and variety.
The Tyrolean hut-style refreshment point on the rooftop is incongruous.

29,Unbeatable Stay,"I went to spend a romantic weekend with my husband and it was spectacular. A well-located hotel with good professionals who are happy to help you with anything and are always smiling from the moment they welcomed us at reception, such as the breakfast waiters or the cleaning people. 100% recommendable, we will repeat for sure!",5,2024,03,31
29,Hall,"The delicate tea service in the hall of the El Palace hotel aims to be a dream for the senses and a delight for the palate.

I would like to point out a detail to take into account, which would not only enhance your establishment but the quality of your service. Given that it is a hotel of such caliber and in which excellence is its letter of introduction. It should have a tea menu in which there is an acceptable variety of what is considered classic teas or some that could be premium, beyond the typical earl grey, jasmine tea, English breakfast, rooibos or chamomile. I have been to hotels and establishments much more modest than El Palace and they had a wide and extensive variety where the tea service was exquisite and was the finishing touch that decorated the place. The Hall of the El Palace hotel should offer this service since its menu not only highlights the exquisite Afternoon tea but also the subtle Cake and bubbles, it should have a minimum list of teas, namely: white tea (Pai Mu Tan, Silver Needle or flavored), black tea (Earl grey, Thai Chai, Assam or flavored), green tea (Sencha, Gunpowder, with Jasmine, Matcha, or flavored), red tea (Pu Erh or flavored), oolong tea, rooibos and various infusions . Thank you very much for the experience.",5,2024,03,16
29,Surprise birthday,"Perfect as always. You can't expect anything else when Marta de Juan is the one who organizes it!

Wonderful birthday. We will repeat.",5,2024,03,11
29,A 10 for a hotel!!,"We got married this past Saturday at the Palace, and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The organizers Eugenia and Marta couldn't have made it easier for us in all this time, super involved and great professionals. To describe the hotel, apart from the fact that the adjective ""beautiful"" falls short, that day the staff that served us could not have been more friendly, not to mention the food, which was spectacular. The super complete appetizer and the menu we chose was a total success, all the guests couldn't stop telling us about it. So if you are looking for a place to get married, the Palace is a safe bet. 100% recommendable!!",5,2024,03,04
29,Don't miss Santa's visit!!!! A dream for children!!!,"We went in December to deliver the letter to Santa Claus and without a doubt we will not miss it in the coming years!!!
We booked the tea service and it is a highly recommended option for families.
Upon entering it is like being in a Christmas story, with the classic revolving door, giant-sized nutcrackers and a carefully decorated lobby for the period.
Without a doubt it is a super endearing place with a lot of charm.

The snack was the best success, but the staff that serves is super affectionate and detail-oriented. We were attended by an older man who was super attentive to us and empathizing with the little ones.
They accept pets and make you feel super comfortable at all times.
Chocolate with churros is a super option for the little ones. And gourmand coffee for adults!!!!

Now they also have the chalet on the terrace to eat a raclette in the purest style of the Swiss mountains!!!!

They always have activities throughout the year and very adapted for any type of occasion, families, couples, etc.

Not to be missed!!!!

Thanks to the super Palace team!!!!

Without a doubt a true Palace",5,2024,03,02

A precious memory has remained.",5,2024,02,21
29,Horrible experience. If they don't wake up...,"Terrible experience. They treated us terribly. It was pouring like it was on Friday night, they didn't want to ask for a taxi and they made us go out to the road to hail one. We didn't even have an umbrella. It tells me that no one even wants to work there. No wonder there are so naughty people.",1,2024,02,12
29,An unparalleled cinematic experience at Bluesman Cocktail Bar!,"We were enjoying an experience for Valentine's Day. On Sundays at 5 p.m., Bluesman Cocktail Bar in the hotel transforms into the perfect setting for the Romantic Cycle, a unique evening for couples who love movies and good company.

29,The worst experience of my life,"They have a place inside the hotel where there is live music where I went to have a drink and listen to music and the truth is that the experience was horrible since when it came to paying I felt totally cheated by having to pay €50 for a drink. I understand that there are places where you pay a little more for many reasons but frankly here I felt ripped off with unfriendly service. Please do not let anyone go to the Bkuesman location of this hotel, for me it has been the worst experience in life and I assure you that I have been to many places around the world and I do not mind paying when there is good service and a good experience, but gentlemen of the Palace Hotel in Barcelona, NOT EVERYTHING GOES",1,2024,02,01

iconic hotels such as le meurice in paris and the dorchester in london. The facilities are very nice and well-kept, the room is great and the staff has an excellent level of service. The location is unbeatable. I would recommend it without a doubt and I would happily stay there again. It was one of the four original hotels that César Ritz opened at the beginning of the 20th century and I think that says a lot. It belongs to the category more than 5 stars",5,2024,01,13

The service is certainly 5 star because the hotel is beautiful and elegant, the breakfast is very extensive and the staff is friendly.

29,Falta mantenimiento,"Las zonas comunes del hotel son estupendas y están bien mantenidas. No es el caso en las habitaciones, en especial de los baños. Me alojé el último fin de semana de mayo. Nos dieron una habitación, la 305, que tenía el baño muy mal mantenido, en especial la ducha. Le dijimos a la persona que acompaña hasta la habitación sobre el problema y nos sentimos muy incómodos: repitió una frase hecha sin contenido, como si uno no fuera una persona medianamente razonable. Nos dijo: ""El hotel es muy antiguo y hay cosas que no podemos tocar por ser patrimonio"". Esto lo señaló en medio de un baño absolutamente refaccionado, como son todos los baños de los hoteles antiguos de lujo.
Nos cambiamos de habitación, la 404. El baño, un poco menos, pero también desgastado (ver foto, pertenece a esta última habitación). Al hacer el check out se lo dijimos al hombre de Recepción. Dijo que lo iba a informar a la Dirección. Como si no lo supieran, pensé...
Un buen hotel lo es en todas partes, no sólo en los salones (más un cinco estrellas Lujo). Y no vale decirles a los pasajeros frases políticamente correctas pero vaciadas de contenido. ",3,2023,06,23

29,Classic Hotel nach der Renovierung,"Ein tolles Classic Hotel nach vollendeter Renovierung. Für uns etwas zu plüschig . Schlafkomfort war top und Ausstattung des Raumes top . Das Frühstück ist gut bis sehr gut und gesamte Hotelteam ist sehr bemüht. Für uns ist das GYM nicht zeitgemäß und auch der Dachpool reicht ausschließlich für eine kleine Erfrischung. Die rooftop Bar ist nett , aber etwas zu pricy. Die Kellerbar ist classic, aber ein Mindestverzehr ist nicht mehr zeitgemäß",4,2023,05,06

29,No hay puntuación que describa la experiencia,"El sábado 22 de enero tenía reserva en este gran hotel para darme un auto regalo de cumpleaños. La verdad que nunca e estado en hotel catalogado como gran lujo aunque si en muchos de 5 estrellas. Quería pasar un finde semana de turismo por barcelona y este hotel me traía recuerdos de infancia cuando pasaba con el autobús por la puerta y lo veías como un sueño inalcanzable. En mi 40 cumpleaños me quise dar el lujo y ya estoy buscando fecha para mi próxima visita. Siempre en mis comentarios digo que nunca doy un excelente porque creo que siempre se puede mejorar. Este no es el caso y va a ser de momento la excepción. Para comenzar llegue temprano sobre las 12 y ya me impresionó que el botones nada más acercarme a la entrada corrió por ayudarme con el equipaje. Me sentí como una famosa. El check in fue rápido y cordial. En este hotel el trato no es constante con recepción como en la mayoría de hoteles que para cualquier duda siempre acudes a ellos. en este caso tiene servicio de conserjería que se desviven por ofrecerte todo lo que se te antoje. Me atendió Javier que no dudo en explicarme todos los servicios del hotel como si de una ruta turística se tratase. Me acompaño a la habitación mostrándome todo lo disponible en ella. Una vez más me hizo sentir como si fuese una famosa. Me postro la maleta en el porta equipajes y se despidió cordialmente. La habitación era preciosa , brillaba de lo limpia que estaba. Disponía de una cama de matrimonio que por las medidas creo que era de unos 180 o 200 cm y un sofá cama el cual lo montan por la noche si vas con peques. El baño era inmenso de un tono de mármol precioso. Con ducha efecto lluvia y una bañera con un diseño precioso donde daban ganas de meterse y no salir. No faltaban detalles , secador profesional, toallas de gran gramaje, gran cantidad de amenities, hasta flores naturales. A desatacar el agua de cortesía catalogada como una de las mejores del mundo. También nos dejaron unas galletitas y zumos para los niños. Quería destacar que es la primera vez que veo en el vestidor detalles como un paraguas .. todo un detalle. Tienen , como no!! Servicio de cobertura. Sobre su desayuno en un principio me quede un poco desanimada porque al haber poca ocupación no estaba el buffet operativo. Bueno!! Al final no fue nada porque aunque es más reducido fue espectacular y muy especial. Tienen una pequeña carta que puedes pedir las veces que desees, jamón ibérico con pan de coca , surtido de quesos , surtido de embutidos, surtido de frutas, surtidos de pastas dulces , huevos en todas sus modalidades, patatas fritas , patatas al horno , salchichas , judías con tomate , ensaladas .. todo delicioso y buen cocinado. A destacar el café que está buenísimo. Y sobre todo y lo que más valore es el personal que tiene este gran hotel en su servicios de desayuno . Siento no saber el nombre de todos , pero quiero felicitar al Sr Manuel bolivar por hacer pasar la mañana de mi cumpleaños un día para recordar. Gracias por el detalle. Valéis mucho!!",5,2022,01,25
29,Lo mejor de nuestras vacaciones,"Pasamos unos días maravillosos en Barcelona y lo mejor de todo era llegar en la noche a una cama deliciosa. La atención del personal es impecable,  nuestra familia estuvo muy bien acogida por todos,  desde el ingreso hasta la atención en el desayuno ....  muy confortables las habitaciones, con baño amplio y realmente  limpio.  Además el hotel esta muy bien ubicado,  rodeado de cafes y tiendas para un shopping variadisimo.  Con certeza volveremos al Palace!!",5,2022,01,20

29,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"Un hotel con mucho encanto y con mucha atención a los pequeños detalles. Nos quedamos en la suite the Johnny Wood y fue una experiencia increíble, nos encantó el tocadiscos vintage que teníamos en la habitación! El rooftop es una maravilla sobretodo el brunch. Repetiremos pronto.",5,2021,10,25
29,Buen hotel,"Se encuentra muy cerca del paseo de gracia de barcelona , con lo cual estas muy cerca de todo, pero lejos del bullicio.
La 1a habitacion que nos dieron era pequeña, ruidosa y bastante triste. En seguida nos cambiaron a un piso mas alto y una habitacion exterior con  magnifica vista.
Desayuno de lujo en un entorno muy bonito",4,2021,08,22
29,Sin palabras!,Espectacular la estancia en el hotel. Combina a la perfección la historia con la parte moderna. SIn lugar a duda una de las referencias en Barcelona. La terraza con piscina y restaurante es increíble. Y un detallazo el cine en la última planta.,5,2021,08,16
29,Nuestra visita al Palace Barcelona  ha sido excelente.,"Además de unos servicios impecables, este clásico de Barcelona, ofrece interesantes actividades en el Rooftop,  música, coctelería, cine y una buena gastronomia y pastelería.

29,Una terraza maravillosa…,Hemos tenido la ocasión de cenar el Hotel  con el menú Secret Garden. Hemos quedado sorprendidos por la alta calidad de su cocina y sus postres excelentes. El lugar es maravilloso al igual que el personal que lo atiende. Esperamos volver bien pronto!,5,2021,07,30
29,Una tarde especial,"Visité el Palace en una de las sesiones de Art & Drinks y pasé una de las tardes más especiales del verano.
En una de las terrazas más bonitas y emblemática de la que he estado, nos enseñaron a hacer cócteles exquisitos mientras aprendimos a pintar junto a Joel Miñana, ilustrador profesional. El ambiente, la naturaleza y las vistas de la terraza del Palace hicieron que la tarde fuera mágica. Recomiendo esta actividad a todas aquellas parejas que quieran hacer algo distinto y romántico en la ciudad de Barcelona (también puede ser un buen plan con un amigo/a). !Me quedé con más ganas de volver y tomarme un Martini en la terraza del Palace!",5,2021,07,28
29,"PLAN IDEAL CON RUMBA, CÓCTELES Y CINE!!!!","Vivo en Barcelona y hace poco me decidí a ir al Cine en la terraza del Hotel. Era un jueves perfecto de verano, buena temperatura, atardecer mágico, y tenía reserva para la película en el rooftop cinema del Hotel Palace ¿Qué más podía pedir? 
PUES SUPERÓ MIS EXPECTATIVAS! Llegué un rato antes del inicio de la peli que ya es un planazo, te incluyen un coctel delicioso (pedí la receta!) y las palomitas con un servicio exquisito además de súper amable. Y lo que me encontré fue un ambiente maravilloso, rumba catalana en vivo, un espacio acogedor muy bien distribuido con todas las medidas de seguridad, y gente linda con ganas de celebrar la vida. Tengo que confesar que me costó subir (sí, tienen doble terraza lo que te permite acceder a unas vistas de Barcelona que te dejan sin aliento) al espacio reservado para el cine. Por lo demás, la selección de la peli adecuada, y como digo, el trato de todo el equipo impecable. Sin duda uno de los top 3 planes para hacer en Barcelona este verano.",5,2021,07,28
29,Art and Drinks,"Tuvimos la oportunidad de reservar para una velada “Art and Drinks” organizada por el Hotel Palace en colaboración con Tombow Spain, Joel Miñana y los deliciosos cocktails de Martini, ¡fue una tarde maravillosa con una compañia excelente!",5,2021,07,26
29,ESPECTACULAR VELADA DE CINE!!,"Fuimos a la terraza del Hotel con mi mujer a ver una película de James Bond...palomitas, cocktail de bienvenida y unos asientos top, comodísimos. en una noche estupenda y clima genial. Aunque la película ya la habíamos visto hace años, el hecho de estar en la terraza del hotel, poquísima gente, al aire libre y con unos asientos tan cómodos, la verdad nos encantó la experiencia!  Muy buena idea por parte del hotel!! Volveremos!",5,2021,07,23
29,INCREÍBLE!,"Al vivir en Barcelona, he tenido la oportunidad de ir varias veces a este hotel. Desde el excelente trato por parte del personal, que te hace sentir como en casa, hasta la oferta que tienen en el rooftop y que no me canso de descubrir (música en directo, cine al aire libre, piscina, talleres y catas... ) hace que para mi sea una apuesta segura. El pasado Jueves organicé una cena con 10 amigas y quedamos todas encantadas! Todas, y mi perrito, con el que vengo la mayor parte de las veces ya que las mascotas son muy bienvenidas :)  Volveremos!!",5,2021,07,23
29,Espectacular!!!,"Hemos ido un grupo de amigos al Brunch & Vinyls. Buen servicio y atención del personal en un ambiente espectacular y comida tal como la imaginamos. Todo digno de un hotel de estas características y estándares.
Muchas gracias a todo el equipo!
Volveremos muy pronto!",5,2021,07,20
29,Un robo,"Hemos ido a comer con unos amigos, la musica de la terraza excesivamente alta, el servicio no esta. La altura. Hemos pedido un vino, Que lo más escandaloso es que multiplica por tres el precio de venta de ese vino. pedimos cafés y se olvidan de ellos, cuando nos traen la cuenta nos habían cobrado cinco postres demás.

Para nada recomendable estafen a los guiris si quieren, pero desde luego no a la gente de la ciudad que viene a comer y les hacen un favor.",1,2021,05,16
29,REALLY GEORGE?,"Celebramos una cena en el Refugio Selva Negra de la terraza del hotel con una ambientación alemana y la comida se suponía que también pero...  DESASTRE. 
El consomé de risa

El Schnitzel nos lo sirven presentándolo como milanesa( no estamos en un restaurante alemán?). Un trozo de carne que no ha visto un mazo para ablandarlo en su vida y de un grosor sobrenatural y un tamaño ridiculo. Mejor no hablamos del empanado y lo grasiento que estaba. 

El apfelstrudel después de salir del microondas lo sirven con una mini bola de helado de chocolate ( señor@s, helado de vainilla cómo se hace en Alemania)

Mejor no hablamos de los acompañamientos como los pretzel recalentados (2 ud 7€)

Después de haber pagado hemos concluido que por el precio pagado te compras un billete low cost y  te vas a Alemania y te comes un menú alemán de verdad. 

Senor@s responsables del restaurante, esta opinión se ajusta a la realidad y no es ninguna pataleta sólo decepción. No es tan difícil hacerlo bien

Si lo desean, encantados les puedo preparar el mismo menú pero de verdad. 

Gracias.

29,Visita profesional.,"Como observador y valorador de diferentes compañías de atención al cliente, he visitado este hotel varias veces antes de la pandemia, la calidad del servicio y la profesionalidad de su personal, avalan una muy buena estancia. las habitaciones limpias hasta el más mínimo detalle comportan satisfacer las expectativas que el cliente espera encontrar en un establecimiento de este calado. La constante circulación que experimenta la Gran Vía de les Corts, no afecta en el descanso ya que las habitaciones, al menos en las que yo he estado, están perfectamente aisladas del ruido. Recomendable al 100%",5,2020,11,17
29,Cine al aire libre #RooftopGarden,"Un plan maravilloso para compartir con amigos en uno de los hoteles con más historia en Barcelona.

29,Top Grandhotel im Belle Epoque Stil,"Das El Palace Hotel liegt sehr zentral in fussweite des Paseo de Gracia. Das Gebäude ist komplett renoviert und hat sich den Charme eines Grandhotels erhalten. Die öffentlichen Räume sind sehr geschmackvoll im Stil der Belle Epoque gestaltet und eingerichtet. Auf dem Dach gibt es einen Pool mit Dachgarten, Bar und spektakulärem Ausblick über Barcelona.  Mindestens einmal sollte man einen Drink in der wunderschönen Bar geniessen. Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. Der Service ist im gesamten Hotel hervorragend und freundlich. Wir wurden als LHW Mitglieder auf eine Superior Suite upgegradet. Die Suite war tadellos, mit allen notwendingen modernen Einrichtugen und einem begehbaren Schrank versehen, das Badezimmer großzüig mit separater Dusche und WC. LHW hat uns den einen oder anderen Vorteil der Mitgliedschaft in diesem Hotel nicht gewährt (was uns nach einigen anderen Problemen mit LHW im Laufe der vergangenen Monate schliesslich motivierte unsere LHW Membership nicht mehr zu verlängern), während uns diese dann alle auf Kosten des Hotels gewährt wurden. Auch hier zeigte sich die 100%ige Kunden- und Serviceorientierung des Hotels. Ich kann das Hotel für alle Liebhaber der Belle Epoque Archtiktur bestens empfehlen.",5,2020,08,30
29,Una estancia preciosa,"Tuvimos la gran suerte de poder alojarnos aquí en nuestro querido hotel Palace, el día de mi cumpleaños. Somos clientes del hotel y residentes aquí en Barcelona. Pero esta última semana nos ofrecieron a los de Barcelona una tarifa incomparable, y tuvimos que aprovecharla! La habitación fue muy cómoda, limpia y bonita. El personal nos trataban con mucho cariño, hasta los que no nos conocían. Son muy cercanos y no hay nada que sea demasiado para ellos: les pides algo e intentan complacertelo. Pude disfrutar de un momento en el spa, y la verdad es que volveré sin pensarlo dos veces. Todavía estoy por las nubes después de mi breve pero bonita estancia en el hotel.",5,2020,03,01
29,Fantástico,"Repetirè. 
Un lugar tranquilo, muy buen servicio, seguro y comida excelente. Nos atendieron con trato exquisito. Y nos gustó también que no fuera un problema comer a las 12:30h.
Habíamos reservado para tres y al final fuimos 4 y  tampoco fue un problema, todo fantástico:)",5,2020,02,21
29,SOGGIORNO ECCELLENTE,"ottimo albergo, gentilezza e professionalità di tutto il personale. Comodissimo al centro, lusso e attenzione massima al cliente. La nostra camera dava sul retro dell'hotel quindi era silenziosissima, tanto che dormivamo con la finestra leggermente aperta. Materasso eccellente con lenzuola pulitissime.

29,Desayuno en el palace. ,"En una sala amplia, bien montada, luminosa y limpia sirven el desayuno de este magnifico y ya centenario hotel de Barcelona.
Bufete amplio, variado y con una calidad correcta.
Embutidos: no son de calidad suprema, pero son de notable.
Bolleria: poca variedad, pero correctos, también notable.
Pan: bien,no extraordinario.
Platos calientes: flojos, rayan en la corrección.
Frutas y verduras: frescas, bien puestas y apetitosas.
Salmón y quesos: poca variedad pero decentes.
Para ser el desayuno de un hotel de lujo y cobrar 30 eu
creo que tendría que ser en general un poco superior a lo que ofrecen.
Lo que sí es de sobresaliente es el servicio que atiende el 
comedor del desayuno, amable, agradable y muy eficiente
Buen desayuno pero no de los mejores.",4,2019,12,25

29,Sehr schönes Grandhotel in bester Lage,"Dieses sehr liebevoll restaurierte Stadthotel strahlt den Charme altehrwürdiger Grandhotels aus, ohne dabei ""alt auszusehen"". Die Mitarbeiter sind alle sehr gut ausgebildet und kompetent, sowohl am Empfang als auch in allen anderen Bereichen. Das Restaurant auf der Dachterrasse ist nicht nur wegen der tollen Aussicht, sondern auch wegen der hervorragenden Küche zu empfehlen. Wenn man dann am Morgen sein Frühstück in dieser unbeschreiblichen Atmosphäre einnimmt, wird einem klar, dass man hier an einem ganz besonderen Ort ist.",5,2019,09,30
29,Ein ehrwürdiges Grandhotel im Herzen der Stadt....,"Diesmal haben wir auf unserem Trip nach Barcelona auch im ""El Palace Hotel"" eine Nacht verbracht und können das Grand-Hotel (in diesem Jahr das 100jährige Bestehen) insbesondere Gästen empfehlen, die hier den Glanz alter Zeiten suchen. Das Hotel ist in einem vorzüglichen Zustand renoviert worden und wir wurden herzlich empfangen. Das Zimmer war in einer exponierten Lage nach vorne heraus gelegen und von der Größe und Helligkeit für uns optimal. Insbesondere das große Bad mit allem Komfort ist hervorzuheben. Natürlich ist die Rooftop Bar mit dem dazugehörigen Pool und Restaurant das Highlight des Hauses und wir haben den Tag am Pool voll relaxen können. Sowohl das Essen am Abend im Restaurant als auch das Frühstück-Buffet war gut, aber nicht mehr und sollte m.E. für ein solches Hotel mit einer solchen Tradition verbessert werden.",4,2019,08,18
29,Expectativas cumplidas,"Este hotel cumple con creces las expectativas de un Gran Lujo. Ademas de su historia y excelente decoración, lo más destacable es su impecable capital humano que se anticipa a tus necesidades.

29,Excelente opción para una agradable velada ,"Fuimos a cenar con un grupo de parejas y resultó ser un éxito. Un espacio único con vistas a la cuidad, sesión de dj y un servicio impecable. La camarera que nos atendió fue encantadora cuidando cada detalle y dando explicaciones detalladas y precisas de todas nuestras dudas, siempre con una sonrisa. Elegimos la opción del menú de tapas y fue todo un acierto. Comida en abundancia, con toques mexicanos y excelente sabor y calidad.
Y el postre espectacular. Gracias a Silvia de eventos por su atención, seguimiento y calidez y también a la Dirección del hotel por sus detalles y atenciones.",5,2019,07,11

29,classico,Abbiamo trascorso un piacevole soggiorno in questo classico albergo di Barcellona. L'ambiente é raffinato e rilassante. Il personale molto cortese e disponibile. Tutti si sono mostrati cordiali ed efficienti dall'arrivo alla partenza. Il letto era molto comodo e la camera in generale confortevole. Piacevole anche la terrazza sul tetto. Un eleganza classica e raffinata. L'unico neo é il ristorante al piano terra contiguo al salone dove l'offerta gastronomica non ê assolutamente all'altezza di un albergo di questo tipo. In carta ci sono piatti semplici ma che potrebbero essere eseguiti molto meglio. l'hamburger era insignificante e lo jamon de bellota quasi sotto la media. Per il resto un ottimo albergo,5,2019,04,20

Un sólo detalle, mantienen la calefacción muy alta en las áreas comunes.",5,2019,02,26

29,Eine schöne Erfahrung,"Das El Palace in Barcelona war eine sehr schöne Erfahrung für uns. Das Hotel ist einmalig schön und der Service bemüht und liebevoll.

Nel mio soggiorno di 4 giorni ho assai apprezzato l'ottimo servizio e l'estrema pulizia non solo delle camere. A proposito di quest'ultime da sottolineare la ""carta dei cuscini"",  apparentemente inutile ma provate a chiedere a chi non trova la posizione per un buon riposo. Servizio eccellente e soprattutto elargito con l'arcinoto spirito d'accoglienza e simpatia del personale. Sicuramente da tornarci, magari in Primavera inoltrata o  Estate.",4,2019,01,02
29,Maravilloso!,"El hotel es una belleza. Súper ubicacion.

29,El hotel más chic y con historia de Barcelona,"Quien no conoce el famoso hotel Ritz de Barcelona?, des de hace muchísimos años fué el hotel más chic y elegante de la época. Si las paredes pudieran hablar de todas las personalidades y famosos que han pasado por este glamoroso Hotel. Des de Dalí a Sophia Loren, desfiles de moda, escritores, artistas, intelectuales, actores, y un largo etcétera. Todavía conserva ese glamour de esa Barcelona tan exquisita. Subir a la terraza es impresionante. 

Who does not know the famous Ritz hotel in Barcelona, ​​since many years ago was the most chic and elegant hotel of the time. If the walls could talk about all the personalities and celebrities that have passed through this glamorous Hotel. From Dalí to Sophia Loren, fashion shows, writers, artists, intellectuals, actors, and many more. It still retains that glamor of that exquisite Barcelona. Climbing the terrace is impressive.",5,2018,11,17

29,Sehr schönes Stadthotel,"Ein sehr schönes und top renoviertes altes Grandhotel (ehemals Ritz). Die Ausgangslage ist ideal und alles vorhanden was man sich wünscht.

Die Zimmer sehr schön und geräumig. Auch sehr ordentlich und sauber.

Leider, wie so oft in Spanien, ein wenig träges Personal insbesondere in der Gastronomie. Sehr viele Mitarbeiter, meistens hektisch aber unkoordiniert. So kann es schon mal sein, dass der Kellner in der Lobby 4 mal an einem vorbeiläuft, bevor man etwas bestellen kann.

Das Frühstück war gut, die Bedienung leider nicht, teilweise sogar unfreundlich.

Die Rooftop Bar bzw. das Restaurant hingegen sehr gut und auch sehr freundliches und aufmerksames Personal. Eine echte Oase auf dem Dach in einer ansonsten eher hektischen Stadt.

",4,2018,10,05
29,Veramente all’altezza ,"Siamo stati in 5 persone con 5 camere, tutto fantastico. La terrazza ha una vista mozzafiato. Piscina piccola ma carina. 
Colazione ottima. Struttura vecchia ma ristrutturata a dovere. Le camere sono pulitissime e veramente spaziose. Pulite. Quello che ci si dovrebbe aspettare da un ***** ma non sempre è così. Da riprovare con famiglia. Bravi!",5,2018,09,14
29,Fantástico,Asistimos a la terraza del hotel palace y nos deslumbró tanto el propio Hotel como el jardín de Diana con numerosas plantas y variedad diversas de vegetales. El trato recibido excelente y las vistas son impresionantes.,5,2018,08,27
29,tolles Hotel mit guter Athosphäre,"Das Hotel ist sehr schön, der Service sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Lage war mal gut, aber in den letzten Jahren haben sich mehr und mehr Hotels und Restaurants am Meer angesiedelt, so dass es um das Hotel herum am Abend nicht so lebending ist.",5,2018,06,16
29,Hotel fantástico,"El hotel es hermoso, amplio, con piscina y bar en la terraza, bar en subsuelo, salones grandes, realmente muy bonito, anteriormente fue un Ritz, lo cual se nota. La atención es excelente, desde el momento que uno llega estan pendientes de cualquier detalle, nos reservaron entrada para visitar La sagrada Familia, todo perfecto. La habitación muy amplia, el baño enorme, estaba ubicada en el primer piso con vista a la calle, pero no se escuchaba ningún ruido. El wifi funcionaba muy bien. La ubicación nos gustó mucho ya que estaba en una zona residencial pero cerca de todo para ir a pie. 
Lo único que puedo mencionar para mejorar considerando la categoría del hotel es que una de las veces que fuimos a desayunar no había lugar y debimos esperar mucho (30 minutos) hasta poder ingresar, eso no es inconveniente, pero a los 5 minutos retiraron todo, lo cual no me pareció bien teniendo en cuenta que el retraso en ingresar no fue por culpa nuestra. 
Lo demás impecable. Super recomendable, ojala podamos volver nuevamente.",5,2018,06,11
29,Terraza fantástica!,"En ocasión de la visita de mi familia, alojada en el hotel Gran Palace, visitamos la terraza para tomar una tapas estupendas y cocktails de los mejores que he probado en mi vida. Manhattan al mejor estilo de New York y servicio estupendo del camarero  italiano y la chica asiática que nos enseñó las vistas que son maravillosas. Volveré! 
",5,2018,05,27
29,El Bluesman ha tocado fondo,"El pasado sábado seguramente el Bluesman vivió su peor día en muchos años. Un local exitoso y único que hace años estuvo gestionado por grandes profesionales que fueron capaces de posicionarlo y competir en lo más alto de la cocteleria de Barcelona. Ha pasado a convertirse con todos los cambios de personal que han habido en los últimos años en un simple bar, un simple local, sin ningún tipo de valor añadido, de encanto, sin la personalidad que en su día le caracterizaba, personalidad que imprimía el equipo que lo gestionaba con talento y pasión. Una vez más se ha cambiado a todo el equipo y el estándar de servicio se ha vuelto a hundir sufriéndolo los clientes y los empleados. En mi opinión es una situación que un hotel de este nivel no se puede permitir. Este sábado, se pudo observar que no había suficiente personal en la sala para atender a los clientes, situación que provocaba un nivel de estrés altísimo en los empleados que lamentablemente los clientes pudimos percibir. Espero que la dirección del negocio tome nota, no deje desatendido al Bluesman y lo vuelva a posicionar donde le corresponde, en lo más alto.",4,2018,05,22
29,Das Hotel ist sehr schön,"Der Eingangsbereich und die Lobby zeugen von alter Pracht und Grösse und sind in einem tadellosen Zustand restauriert worden. 
Also es ist wunderschön sich in ruhe um zu sehen und all die details zu enddecken.
Leider ist das Personal einwenig Abwesend und fast schon des intressiert.
Die Höflichkeit wirkt gespielt.
Fühlten uns nicht so wirklich Willkomen.
Das Zimmer ist sehr schön sauber und es hat alles was man braucht.
Es wirkte auf uns eher wie ein Museum....
Essen nahmen wir ausserhalb zu uns.
Die ausgezeichneten Lage und der imposanten Architektur zählt es sicherlich zu den führenden Hotels der Stadt.
Alles in allem ganz ok.
Wir wünschten uns mehr Ehrlich gemeinte Freundlichkeit , so das man sich wohlfühlt und willkomen.",3,2018,05,17
29,Probablemente el mejor de Barcelona,"Nos hospedamos una noche y asistimos a una boda celebrada en dicho hotel.
Es un 5 estrellas gran lujo, en el que destaca sobre todo la atención del personal. Realmente hacen que te sientas especial.
Dejas el coche delante del hotel, recogen tu equipaje y llevan el coche al parking para que No tengas que preocuparte de nada. Servicio de habitaciones rápido y eficiente.
Solicitamos que nos plancharan con urgencia un vestido y una camisa y en apenas media hora los teníamos listos en la habitación.
Habitación excelente, con una cama amplísima y muy cómoda. Televisión oculta en un espejo, chimenea y mobiliario de calidad. 

Cuidan los detalles propios de un GL.
Lógicamente los precios son altos. Pero es el precio de la exclusividad.

Anteriormente era el ""Ritch"" y tras una profunda reforma, todavía se observan reminiscencias del mismo, la ""R"" sigue estando presente en muchos lugares.

29,Wahrlich eines der wenigen klassischen Grandhotels in Spanien...,"Das ehemalige ""Ritz"" und ""Leading Hotel of the World"" zählt sicherlich zu den noch wenigen klassischen Grand-Hotels in Spanien. Da es in nächster Nähe zu den Haupteinkaufsstraßen liegt, statteten wir dem Hotel einen Besuch ab und tranken einen Espresso. Zum Eingangsbereich überschritten wir eine in den Boden verankerte goldene Platte, die aufs Hotel Ritz  (1919 - 1993) verwies. Der Eingangsbereich und die Lobby zeugen von alter Pracht und Größe und sind in einem tadellosen Zustand restauriert worden. Das Personal wirkte auf uns ein wenig teilnahmslos; und überhaupt fehlten uns an diesem Vormittag die Menschen und damit ein wenig Leben in der prachtvollen Lobby. Es wirkte auf uns eher wie ein Museum....Von der ausgezeichneten Lage und der imposanten Architektur zählt es sicherlich zu den führenden Hotels der Stadt.",5,2018,02,18

29,Tradición y chic en la ciudad condal,"Uno de los clásicos y emblemáticos hoteles de Barcelona, en gran estima entre los locales y foráneos por sus elegantes salones y terraza de lujo, calidad de servicio, ubicación privilegiada...

La experiencia de 5* es suma de pequeños detalles, como una limpieza impecable de las zonas comunes y de las habitaciones, textil de primera, buen ambiente, gente guapa y un largo etcétera. The Palace lo tiene todo.

Pasamos en petit comite la Nochevieja en este precioso hotel. El aperitivo nos dejó k.o. Un lujazo! Desde macarons de remolacha y huevos con caviar (se dice pronto, pero era un consomé de puerro o de coliflor (?) con huevo marinado y cucharadita de caviar servidos en cáscara de huevo!), jamón divino de la muerte, milhojas de foie con manzana verde y cebolla caramelizada y otros tantos platos hasta fideuá y risotto, todo acompañado con un champagne rosado. Sublime! 

Lástima que empezáramos muy pronto, a las 20:30, y a las nueve y minutos ya pasamos del lobby principal a las mesas y la cena se ralentizó bastante con los platos que quedaban. 

En resumen el aperitivo -un 10! La cena correcta, pero sin chispa. El duo de piano y violín / voz encargados de amenizar la cena, no entusiasmó. 

Un puntazo el Kids club con un equipo de animación inmejorable. Nuestro gran saludo a Alejandra y sus compañeras! 

El cotillón y el baile para mi gusto flojitos. 

Es cierto que Barcelona a diferencia quizás de las demás ciudades españolas es más cosmopolita y hay mucho extranjero y poco local celebrando esta cena del año. No se puede achacar el ambiente al hotel, pero echamos de menos el desmelene del año pasado en Madrid))). 

Por diferencia de horarios en los países de origen de los comensales o por su timidez natural (que también)), la fiesta a la 1:30 ya finalizó.",5,2018,01,15
29,Un modelo que ya no,"Creo que es un tipo de lujo mal entendido. Demasiada alfombra, demasiado personal por todas partes, pero la decoración es antigua y anticuada, rozando y tocando el mal gusto. El gran salón central es incómodo y la decoración, a pesar de mantenerse fiel a su estilo, necesita un “rethinking”. Para ser un 5 estrellas le falta actualizarse.",3,2018,01,14
29,DEMASIADAS ESPECTATIVAS ,"Mi valoración no es del hotel, ya que no hemos tenido posibilidad de alojarnos en el, nuestra visita fue como consecuencia de una boda que con muchísimo cariño los novios prepararon para su familia y me gustaría comentar,  ójala les sirva para mejorar el planteamiento y la respuesta ante una cliente diferente,  "" vegana"".
Cuando se dispone de la información con tiempo, me imagino que un establecimiento de esta categoría asume el riesgo de que este cliente ""diferente"" salga satisfecho y contento.  
Durante la recepción,  explendida,  variada y abundante para el resto, se solicitó en repetidas ocasiones lo que iba a picar este invitado, y casi a la finalizacion de la misma,  momentos antes de abrir el comedor trajeron una ensalada, explendida, que por cierto la repitieron como primer plato en el banquete. 
Como segundo plato, Risoto de setas, ( nos le ocurrió probarlo a nadie?), excesivamente especiado. 
A nadie se le ocurrió aconsejar a los novios con los postres,  después del plato principal un sorbete con zumo de mango y como postre,  seguido, una excelente tarta de chocolate, helado y sirope de mango... 
a mi no me cuadra,  excesivo mango.
Con todo esto lo que les quiero trasmitir con todo mi respeto es, que un cliente defraudado tiene mayor peso específico que muchos que estén contentos,  y espero que la próxima persona vegana que Vds tengan que atender,  escriba de sus excelencias en la cocina. 
Atentamente 
Nota: un error en la primera aportación de este establecimiento,  ha hecho que se retrase en el tiempo mi critica. 
Poco a poco las personas veganas están encontrado en muchos establecimientos respuesta a sus necesidades y este hotel seguro que se lo puede permitir.

Su ubicación es muy buena, ya que se encuentra a 200 metros del Paseo de Gracia y a unos 300 metros de la Plaza Cataluña. El desayuno también es excelente.

29,Un Gran Hotel en Barcelona,"Desde nuestra llegada el trato por parte del personal del hotel fue estupendo. Como miembros de LHW se respetaron todos nuestros beneficios (obsequio de bienvenida, upgrade de habitacion y desayuno de cortesía).

El estilo del hotel es clásico, lujoso y está perfectamente mantenido y renovado. Las habitaciones estan decoradas  de acuerdo al estilo del hotel y nuestra suite (nro. 319) era sumamente amplia y cómoda (el baño era increíblemente grande, especialmente el super box de ducha). Los artículos de tocador gratuitos de Chopard que ofrecen son excelentes.
La limpieza del hotel y habitaciones tambien es muy buena. 
Con respecto a los alimentos y bebidas, el room service fue rapido y bueno y el desayuno era muy bueno, tanto en el servicio como en la calidad y sobre todo variedad de los alimentos. Ofrecen incluso un sector oriental en el buffet que es espectacular.

Ese día tuvimos claro que queríamos celebrar nuestra boda allí. Marta Sala nos ayudó en todo a lo largo de los meses anteriores a nuestra boda y siempre lo hizo de manera eficiente y rápida. Realmente tuvimos la sensación de que no teníamos que preocuparnos por nada. Y así fué!

Lamentablemente a partir de Enero y hasta el día de hoy empezó la triste decadencia de un negocio exitoso. De lo que fue a lo que es no hay color.

Park Guell mit dem Bus 45 Minuten entfernt.
Sehr freundlicher und netter Empfang im Hotel. Schneller und freudnlicher Check In.
Koffer wird zum Zimmer gebracht, das Zimmer erklärt.
Das Hotel ist sehr ruhig, bis auf die Zimmertüren die sehr schwer sind und einfach knallen müssen. Wir hatten die einfachste Zimmerklasse mit Frühstück. Betten sehr bequem, Bad groß mit Badewanne und Regendusche, seperate Toilette. TV Gerät im Schlafzimmer im Spiegel versteckt. VIele Sender jedoch nur 2 deutsche Kanäle.
WIFI kostenfrei und recht schnell.
Frühstück im Wintergarten sehr gut, allerdings nicht so herausragend wie hier manche beschrieben haben. Buffetform und Eierspeisen teilweise auf Bestellung.
Wir hatten am Sonntag die Afterteatime gebucht. Sehr nett und sehr lecker.
Beim bezahlen der Teatime gabe es etwas Verwirrung über die Kosten, dieses wurde von Hotel jedoch sehr proffesionell und zu meiner vollsten Befriedigung geregelt.
Auf dem Dach ein kleiner Pool, das Sternerestaurant und auch eine Bar. Am ersten Abend haben wir dort was getrunken der der sehr guten Livemusik gelauscht.

",5,2017,04,21
29,Etwas in die Jahre gekommenes Hotel mit wenig Leben.,"Das Hotel, gebaut 1919, ist ein ehemaliges prachtvolles Ritz Hotel. Das Haus ist sehr gepflegt und das Personal ausgesprochen  professionell und freundlich. Die Räumlichkeiten und Salons des Hauses sind prachtvoll eingerichtet, ganz im Stil der Jahrhundertwende. 
Die Lage ist für einen Sightseeing Besuch der Stadt perfekt. Wenige Gehminuten zur Sagrada Familia, und anderen Gebäuden der Modernisme von Antoni Gaudi bis  Lluis Domenech i Montaner etc. Direkt fußläufig zu erreichen ist auch die breite elegante Einkaufsstraße Paseo de Gracia mit den Geschäften namhafter Designer. Die Altstadt und den Hafen  erreicht man über die Rambla Catalunya in gut 15 Minuten zu Fuß. 
Die Zimmer im Hotel sind geräumig zum Teil renoviert ( wir konnten einen Blick in unser sehr elegantes Nebenzimmer werfen) , zum Teil eben auch noch in 
altem Zustand. Wir hatten leider solch ein altes Zimmer im 6. Stock, das zwar gepflegt und sauber , aber leider durch zahlreiche Flecken auf dem Boden und vor allem an den Wänden nicht sehr schön anzusehen war. Das Bad passte nicht recht zum altmodischen Stil des Zimmers (war wohl schon mal renoviert worden), die dunklen, moderneren Fliesen wiesen im Bereich der Dusche sehr hässliche weiße Kalkflecken und -ränder auf. Zumindest war die Qualität des Bettes  hervorragend. Im Zimmer gab es einen uralten Fernseher ohne HD-Qualität, der mal ausgetauscht werden müsste.WLAN im Hause kostenlos. 
Hervorzuheben ist wohl das besonders reichhaltige Frühstück in einem herrlichen Wintergarten. 
Auf dem Dach des Hauses befindet sich ein Pool mit entsprechenden Sonnenliegen und ein Restaurant. Wir sind dort am ersten Abend essen gewesen, waren aber von der Qualität nicht begeistert. Die Einrichtung der Gartenmöbel und Liegen ist leider auch schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen. 
Leider findet in dem Hotel nicht sehr viel Leben statt. In den Salons sieht man nur sehr selten jemanden und auch auf der Dachterrasse und im Restaurant war es mehr als ruhig......Nach Rückkehr von einem Abendessen außerhalb gab es im Hotel nirgends einen Raum, der zu einem kleinen Drink vor dem Schlafengehen eingeladen hätte.  Lediglich am Morgen zum Frühstück war reger Betrieb. Es gibt eine Bar im Hotel, die aber nur an wenigen Tagen in der Woche geöffnet ist. 
Insgesamt kann man sagen: ein ordentliches Hotel, das für uns seinen Zweck erfüllt hat und als Ausgangspunkt unserer Sightseeingtour o.k. war. Ein wenig enttäuscht waren wir schon.......",3,2017,04,03

29,Grandhotel früher Hotel RITZ,"Das Hotel EL PALACE ( bis 2009 Hotel Ritz) ist das führende Haus in Barcelona. Nach zweijähriger Renovierung wurde es 2011 wiedereröffnet und bitte OldWorldCharme auf höchstem Niveau. Die Zimmerausstattung ist auf dem neuesten stand, aber in ""altem Gewand"", so befindet sich z.B. der Fernseher in einem alten Spiegel integriert über dem Kamin wieder, die MiniBar versteckt sich hinter einem klappbarem Bild.

29,Es war einmal ein Ritz...,"Eine gewisse Aura des Märchenhaften umgibt das Hotel El Palace, welches sich vor gar nicht allzu langer Zeit noch “Ritz” nennen durfte. 

“They don’t make ‘em like that anymore” - dies trifft auf das El Palace vollumfänglich zu, ist es doch ein Grand Hotel alter Schule, mit verschwenderisch großzügigen öffentlichen Bereichen (die heute zweifelsohne für den Kongressbereich oder eine kleine Einkaufspassage eingeplant würden), Inneneinrichtung von wirtschaftlich kaum darstellbarer Opulenz (alleine die Seidentapeten würden schnell wegrationalisiert werden) und, vor allem, einem Service, der diese Inszenierung des Luxus’ nicht nur nicht stört, sondern konsequent aufrechterhält. Mit anderen Worten: Im El Palace fühlt man sich wie ein höchst willkommener persönlicher Gast, was dazu führt, dass man dieses Hotel schnell als das eigene empfindet. Das ist nicht weniger als große Gastgeberkunst. 

Diese Mischung aus Dekadenz und Behaglichkeit ist selten, und läßt sich ebenso wenig am Reisbrett planen wie die erlebte Geschichte, die man dem El Palace bis in den letzten Winkel anmerkt. 

Aber auch abseits solch ätherischer Qualitäten überzeugt die Traditionsadresse unweit des Plaza Catalunya: Die Betten sind sehr bequem (wenn auch etwas kurz für überdurchschnittlich hochgewachsene Gäste), die Bäder großzügig (obschon manches Detail etwas schlampig ausgeführt ist) und die allgemeine Ausstattung - von den Möbeln bis zu den Bademänteln - hochwertig. Nur der Strassenverkehr ist in den nach außen ausgerichteten Zimmern nicht komplett weggedämmt. 

Das Frühstück zeigt einmal mehr den Unterschied zwischen “fünf Sternen” und einem wahren Grand Hotel auf: Die Backwaren sind durch die Bank schmackhaft, ebenso der Aufschnitt und die asiatischen Spezialitäten, die sich an Gäste aus Übersee richten. Kleine Abzüge gibt es für den sehr durchschnittlichen Kaffee, den nicht frisch gepressten Orangensaft und die Tatsache, dass für Eggs Benedict ein arg üppiger Aufpreis zum sowieso nicht bescheidenen Pauschalpreis für das Buffet aufgerufen wird. Doch die alternativ angebotenen pochierten Eier entpuppen sich dafür zu einer umso erfreulicheren Überraschung: auf den Punkt gegart werden sie - mit Schnittlauch, Maldon Sea Salt und einem entzückenden Olivenöl serviert - zu einer veritablen Köstlichkeit!

Die Dachterrasse mit sensationeller Aussicht über Barcelona ist darüber hinaus ebenso ein Leckerbissen für den Hotelgast mit romantischer Ader wie die auf angenehme Weise schummrige, aber dennoch gediegene Bar im Keller. 

Das El Palace ist, Gott sei Dank, kein totrestaurierter Protztempel oder historisierte Retorten-Prachtherberge. Dieses Hotel hat Seele. Möge das lange so bleiben!",5,2017,01,20
29,Excelente Hotel en Barcelona,"Hablar de este hotel, es hablar de ubicación, de atención, de buena comida y de calidad en las habitaciones.  Hotel de lujo con una gran atención en Barcelona y muy buen ubicado para caminar y conocer Barcelona.

El desayuno, espectacular en la zona del patio, un deleite de los sentidos. La terraza, ideal para tomarse un buen licor o un vino en la tarde y mejor si es en verano.

La atención que nos prestaron fue excelente.  Recomiendo este Hotel para disfrutar Barcelona.

29,Gran lujo clásico,"Elegimos el Palace porque nos apetecía disfrutar de una experiencia de clasicismo y acertamos plenamente. Este fantastico hotel reune todos los requisitos para sentirse en un gran establecimiento de principios del s. XX con las comodidades actuales. Es maravilloso entrar a su vestíbulo y contemplar su gran salon mientras se hacen cargo de tus maletas desde la misma puerta . Tanto en check - in como la salida son muy rápidos y existe una zona de conserjería donde depositas y recoges las llaves con un su borla de flecos granate. Glamour muy por encima de las actuales tarjetas de plástico. Te preguntan que prensa deseas y todas las mñanas tienes tu periódico enla manivela de la puerta de la habitación.
Las habitaciones y los baños son amplios y cómodos, con las chimeneas originales de 1919.. Extraordinariamente confortable la cama y una caricia las sabanas y almohadas y una insonorización perfecta . 
Es un autentico placer disfrutar del magnifico buffet de desayuno en el jardin, que en invierno se encuentra techado con un toldo y acondicionado. Todo productos frescos y de gran calidad. Y despues terminar de leer tu prensa en alguno de los maravillosos salones.
Todo el personal es enormemente atento y de gran simpatia y profesionalidad.
Evidentemente no es barato, pero considero que tiene una magnifica relacion calidad - precio, y que se trata de uno de esos placeres que uno debe probar alguna vez en la vida.
Nosotros volveremos y recomendamos sinceramente la experiencia.

29,Aftertoon Tea mit Miguel Angel,"Wir hatten uns das Restaurant für ein Abendessen ausgesucht. Der Eingang ist schon mal sensastionell traditionell schön gehalten und man hat eine unglaubliche Atmosphäre. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.
Miguel Angel hat uns gleich herzlich und freundlich empfangen und uns auch die Gerichte erklärt. Das Essen war super, die Drinks noch besser und das ganze Ambiente einfach WOW.
Da wir so begeistert waren, haben wir uns noch für den Afternoon Tea entschieden. Dies war sogar noch einen Tag vorher spontan möglich, worüber wir uns sehr gefreut haben. Auch an diesem Tag war Miguel Angel wieder dort und hat mit uns erstmal ein angenehmes Gespräch gehalten. 
Der Afternoon Tea ist unbeschreiblich. Eine Etagere, wie man sie ihresgleichen sucht. Feinste Spezialitäten und auch der Kaffee/Tee waren top. Empfehlen kann ich vor allem den Amaretto Sour, einfach lecker.
Miguel Angel ist einfach super, der netteste ""Chef-Gastronom"", den wir kennen gelernt haben und immer ein Lächeln auf den Lippen.

Vielen Dank, wir kommen wieder.

Nur ein paar Gehminuten von der La Rambla entfernt. Das Hotel befindet sich in einem prächtigen und top renovierten Altbau. Die Gäste sind aus allen Ländern und in einem guten Verhältnis.

Das Check-in geht schnell und das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Frühstück ist vielfältig, frisch und wird im schönen und gedeckten Innenhof oder im offenen Garten serviert. 

Die Dachterrasse und der dortige Pool sind traumhaft. Da braucht man gar nicht an den Strand zu gehen!

Die Junior Suite ist sehr geräumig und hat ein eigenes Garderobenzimmer. Das riesige Doppelbett (Cocomat-Matratze) ist sehr bequem. Die Suite ist absolut schallisoliert, kann vollständig verdunkelt werden und hat eine gute Klimaanlage, welche keinen Lärm und keinen Luftzug verursacht.

Das Badzimmer besteht aus einer sehr grossen Doppeldusche aus feinstem Marmor und einer Badewanne. Es hat genügend Licht auch für die Frauen zum Schminken. Das Vanity-Kit ist vorbildlich (Zahnbürste, Zahnpaste, Rasierer, Rasiercrème etc.).

29,Hervorragendes Hotel ,"Wir waren als Paar für 4 Tage in dem El Palace. Das Hotel liegt zentral gelegen an der Gran via de les Corts Catalanes. Zu Fuß ist man in 15 min. am Hafen bzw. Balcoloneta. In der Altstadt ist man in 10 Minuten. Das Hotel hat den Charme eines klassischen Gran Hotels. Wer solche pompöse Hotels mag, wird  das El Palace lieben. Das Personal ist englischsprachig und sehr freundlich. Es gibt hier nichts auszusetzen und die die Erwartungen an ein 5-Sterne-Haus wurden voll erfüllt. Das Frühstück ist reichhaltig mit guter Auswahl. Gegessen wird im Wintergarten. Dort war es Mitte Februar trotz Heizpilzen etwas kalt, das war aber auch der einzige negative Punkt. Die Hotelbar haben wir selbst nicht genutzt, soll aber ebenfalls sehr gut sein. Die Zimmer waren absolut sauber. Zimmer und Bad sind großzügig geschnitten. Von dem Verkehrslärm bekommt man nichts mit. Alles in allem kann ich das Hotel uneingeschränkt empfehlen. ",5,2016,04,25

Como antiguo Ritz (el cuarto en el mundo, cronológicamente) está lleno de mil y una historias que se pueden leer en el libro que las recoge o en las visitas guiadas que se ofrecen a petición. Desde la magnífica terraza que está en el último piso se puede admirar la belleza de la ciudad y en el club en los bajos degustar un delicioso cóctel escuchando música en directo mientras la noche tiernamente avanza...",5,2016,04,20
29,"bella esperienza, magnifica struttura, ma qualcosa di stonato nel ristorante stellato!","Gran bella esperienza al El Palace di Barcellona. Non di certo stupito secondo l'assioma qualità/prezzo. Reception e Concierge, bell boy e portiere, ci hanno accolto con grande gentilezza, mantenendola durante il soggiorno. Belle stanze e veramente tenute bene nei due servizi giornalieri. La colazione servita in camera stitica (se richiedo due tè , perché portare una sola bustina filtro?) e mai precisa nell'esecuzione della domanda: ma la grande gentilezza del personale addetto, ha sopperito il tutto. Ma la nota stonata l'abbiamo trovata al ristorante Caelis. Premesso che il personale gentile e di ottima preparazione, annoverava, comunque, una signorina con il gusto della reprimenda. Ad una prima info su cibi che creavano allergia, abbiamo risposto no. Poi vedendo che apparecchiavano per qualcosa di non ordinato, chiedemmo spiegazione e risposero simpaticamente: Sorpresa! ... quando scoprimmo che la sorpresa era un uovo, credo tipo coque, ringraziammo, ma non amando l'uovo, rigettammo l'offerta. Subito dopo arriva ""l'erinni"" volendo, con fermezza, conto e soddisfazione dato che precedentemente dicemmo di non ""temere"" nessun cibo. Ma si parlava di allergie non di gusto!... dopo un po d'insistenza, prese posate e ammennicoli per la presentazione e se ne andò. Non ci ha più rivolto lo sguardo per tutta la sera e neanche il saluto all'uscita, contrariamente a tutti gli altri. Sono stato prolisso, ma dovevo raccontarlo bene. 
Comunque nulla osta a ritornare, con gioia e spensieratezza, a El Palace di Barcellona.",5,2016,04,01

29,Diamogli una sistemata!,"Albergo Unico a Barcellona! 5 stelle lusso appartenente alla catena leading. Meta di molti personaggi storici e dello spettacolo; anche Dali' vi soggiornò  e a questo proposito gli fu dedicata una suite. Mi ha colpito molto l'accoglienza! Ottima la presentazione della struttura e la cortesia del personale. Un po' troppo vecchiotto per i miei gusti. Anche se le camere recentemente ristrutturate offrono confort di ogni genere. Gli spazi comuni e i tendaggi troppo pesanti e impolverati. Non mi è piaciuta la colazione servita in veranda. Un hotel 5 stelle, a mio avviso, non può dedicare uno spazio così mediocre per offrire la colazione. La SPA? Ce la siamo dimenticata? Comunque nel complesso una buona struttura. Spolveratela di più e rimuovete tappezzerie inutili. Tornerò a visitare la piscina sul tetto costruita di recente.",3,2015,12,16

29,Bello ma...,Posizione straordinaria: sei dentro a Barcellona in una posizione centralissima.  Hall bellissima. Camere spaziose e curate. Manca però una spa dignitosa accessibile senza dover per forza prenotare un massaggio.  Per un 5 stelle si può fare di più ,4,2015,08,20
29,Stupendo ma d'inverno...,"Sono stato due notti in giugno di passaggio e mi sono trovato bene. Mi hanno fatto l'upgrade in una junior suite che devo dire è enorme, il bagno è grandissimo e moderno mentre la camera un po' vecchia. La tv grandina ma lcd loewe vecchiotto, la moquette non mi piace mai nelle cameriere per motivi igienici quindi non mi piaceva molto, le finestre sono vecchissime ma coperte da tendaggi enormi ottocenteschi attacca polvere, le pareti con carta da parati in tessuto. La camera è super pulita e maestosa con comodini giganteschi e un superlettone, però tutti sti tessuti e la moquette la rendono abbastanza old style e polvere friendly. Io metterei un parquet e sarebbe perfetta. La sala nella hall è gigantesca e molto bella tipo un pò versaille, però trasmette un senso di vecchio e poco luminoso. La colazione molto abbondante e buona. Enorme pecca manca una spa con piscina interna e considerando che manca anche una piscina esterna è un hotel consigliabile per periodi freddi rispetto che in estate. Personale e cameriere top. Essendo stato anche al mandarin oriental hotel e al 1898 hotel devo riassumere che il top rimane il mandarin anche se il rooftop pool del 1989 è il migliore. Comunque l'hotel el palace (ex ritz carlton) rimane un'ottima scelta, ma più per una clientela over 50.",4,2015,08,14
29,"""La Grande Dame"" - ein Grand Hotel im Zentrum der Sehenswürdigkeiten","Das neo-klassische Hotel war von 1919 - 1993 das Ritz-Hotel in Barcelona. Der Eingang, die Lobby, der Salon, das Treppenhaus, die Bluesman-Bar und die Zigarren-Lounge lassen den Gästen die Vergangenheit ""erleben"". Die Zeit scheint hier seit knapp 100 Jahren still zu stehen - allerdings sind die Zimmer mit modernen Einrichtungselementen völlig renoviert und entsprechen einem 5-Sterne de Luxe Hotel. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich, das Einchecken bei der Rezeption verlief zügig. Wir wurden auf unser geräumiges Zimmer - Kategorie Classic - begleitet und über die modernen technischen Einrichtungen informiert. Die Minibar hinter dem Rahmen hätten wir alleine nicht entdeckt, ebenso wenig den Flachbildfernseher, der als Spiegel getarnt war. So wurde der Eindruck eines ""klassischen"" Zimmers durch moderne Technik nicht gestört.Der Kleiderschrank mit Safe bot genügend Stauraum, das Bad mit Dusche, Wanne, 2 Waschbecken mit viel Ablageraum, Rasierspiegel und Föhn sowie einem separatem WC war äußerst großzügig und modern ausgestattet. Telefon, Schreibtisch, französischer Balkon, Bademantel und Hausschuhe sowie eine große Flasche Wasser täglich ergänzten den Komfort, den man von einem Luxushotel erwartet.
Das Frühstück konnte man im Wintergarten oder auf der anschließenden romantischen Mini-Terrasse mit Brunnen genießen, das Buffet war reichhaltig und wurde ansprechend präsentiert. Im Hotel gibt es auch das 1-Sterne-Restaurant ""Caelis"", einen Spa, ein Fitness- und Business-Center. Das Schwimmbad auf dem Dach wird erst Ende Juli / August fertiggestellt. Der Concierge war sehr kompetent und äußerst hilfsbereit - er konnte für alle Fragen eine Lösung finden. Auch das Personal (Bar, Frühstück, Zimmer) passte zum Stil des Hauses. Die schönsten Sehenswürdigkeiten Barcelonas - Passeig de Gràcia mit den berühmten Jugendstilhäusern Casa Lleo Morera, Casa Amatller und Casa Batllo sowie Casa Mila (Pedrera), der Placa de Catalunya, die Ramblas und das Gotische Viertel mit der mittelalterlichen Kathedrale und den engen Gassen sind zu Fuß erreichbar (siehe meine weiteren Beschreibungen).

Excelente servicio. ",5,2015,07,13
29,Nicht gerade günstig aber günstig gelegen,"Dieses Hotel liegt für die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten richtig günstig. Der Service war perfekt, insbesondere die der Concierges bei der Restaurant-Suche. Wir wurden mit einem upgrade beim Einchecken überrascht und hatten dann aber das Gefühl man mache mit uns einen Scherz: Das wunderschöne Zimmer lag im 6. Stock und im 7. Stock wurde lautstark renoviert. Was nicht ganz so tragisch war, da wir viel außerhalb waren. Dennoch unsere Siesta klappte nicht einwandfrei. Als uns Julie 2 Tage später ansprach wie es uns geht, haben wir auf die Bauarbeiten hingewiesen (nicht beschwert!). Dennoch wurde uns flux eine Suite angeboten und wir zogen um. Und die Suite war prächtig und einzigartig! Noch ein weiterer Pluspunkt des Hotels: Das Restaurant Caelis: Wir waren dort zweimal Essen so toll hat es uns dort geschmeckt!",5,2015,07,05

29,Simbolo della tradizione alberghiera di Barcellona.,"Siamo stati ospiti di questa meravigliosa struttura che si trova nel centro di Barcellona, a metà strada tra piazza Catalunya e la Sagrada Familia. 

Già dall’ingresso si percepisce la storia e il fasto di questo hotel; ci si sente accolti e viziati in questo ambiente permeato di quel lusso un po’ retrò, ma al tempo stesso moderno.
Dopo aver fatto il check-in siamo stati accompagnati in camera e aperta la porta abbiamo trovato un piccolo corridoio, (dotato di porta) con funzione di isolare dai rumori esterni, che ci ha introdotti in una assai ampia stanza dotata di ogni confort, un grande e comodo letto, una scrivania sulla quale abbiamo trovato una bottiglia di kava ad attenderci e dei deliziosi cioccolatini.

Ci ha affascinato la soluzione adottata per integrare nell’arredamento della stanza la tv, che si palesa dietro lo specchio solo nel momento in cui viene accesa. Altra interessante soluzione è per il mobile bar, che è nascosto dietro un quadro.
Nessun dettaglio è trascurato, a partire dal set di cortesia per la toilette, composto da prodotti di prima qualità, per proseguire con apposito menu per scegliere la tipologia di cuscino preferito, fino a trovare il letto con lenzuolo con angolo ripiegato e relativo cioccolatino e ciabattine deposte a lato per la notte.

Capitolo a parte merita il bagno che è di notevoli dimensioni, dove si trova non solo il doppio lavandino, la vasca e il box doccia, ma anche l’armadio ( che al suo interno alloggia  un ombrello a disposizione degli ospiti) e una stanza separata per il wc.

Una menzione particolare per la colazione servita in una sorta di giardino d’inverno e che mette a disposizione un ricco buffet dal dolce al salato con una cura impeccabile per la qualità della materia prima. Il mio consiglio per chi si reca a Barcellona è quello di soggiornare in questo stupendo hotel.",5,2015,05,26
29,Luces y más penumbra,"Gran presencia. Buena habitación con una baño limpio y espacioso.
Pero en los detalles fail. Las toallas dignas de un bed&Breakfast de tercera.
Servicio de desayuno pésimo, sin servicio, tardo en atender.
A la despedida fuimos a llevar la maleta al coche y el conserje se preocupó en decir si habíamos pagado antes de preguntar si habíamos estados bien. Como si nos fuéramos a escapar, por cierto, estaba todo ya abonado. Muy mal.",2,2015,05,14

29,Una grata sorpresa,Habitaciones completamente reformadas con muy buen gusto en un hotel de lujo en el centro de Barcelona. Grandes baños y ambiente tranquilo. Servicio muy amable. Los salones son clásicos pero imponentes. Una magnífica opción para los que visitan Barcelona.,5,2015,05,05
29,"Ein ""Grand Hotel"" im besten Sinne des Wortes","Sehr schönes, komplett renoviertes Grand-Hotel (das frühere Ritz) mit dem Charme der vergangenen Zeit gepaart mit modernstem Komfort in den Zimmern. Sehr zentral gelegen, sehr aufmerksamer und kompetenter Service. Perfekte Korrespondenz mit dem Concierge Service (bezüglich Blumen, Cava und Snacks auf dem Zimmer). Alles hat hervorragend geklappt! 
Sehr reichhaltiges und qualitativ hochwertiges Frühstück. Aber das wirklich Besondere ist die Hotelhalle. Dort einen der (sehr reichhaltig bemessenen) Cocktails zu nehmen, bevor man zum Dinner geht, ist ein Erlebnis. Diesen Sommer werden auf dem Dach noch ein Schwimmbad und eine grosse Dachterrasse gebaut – dann wird es noch schöner sein. 
Ein Deluxe Standardzimmer reicht völlig aus: grosses, komfortables Bad, genügend Schrankraum für Zwei, das Bett sehr komfortabel. 
Wer gerne mit offenem Fenster schläft, sollte ein Zimmer nach hinten nehmen, denn der Verkehr auf der Gran Via ist schon enorm. Ansonsten sind die Fenster perfekt schallisoliert und die Klimaanlage flüstert nur….
Kurzum: Ein Hotel, wie es uns gefällt",5,2015,04,26
29,Una estancia de ensueño!,"Nos hemos pasado un fin de semana con mi pareja en el Palace.
Todo ha sido de lujo, desde la calidad del ambiente al pasar las puertas del hotel hasta la comida excepcional, pasando por el increíble servicio de consejería y relaciones publicas, que siempre iban un paso delante de nosotros y nuestros deseos! Special thanks to Katérina!
El Spa 5 estrellas también es maravilloso ... 
Un must go, lo recomiendo a todos mis amigos!",5,2015,04,22
29,Ottimo ma si può fare di meglio!,"Abbiamo prenotato El Palace per le vacanze pasquali che coincidevano con il regalo per un compleanno mlto importante. La struttura è quella del Ritz Hotel che dopo il rinnovo nel 2009 ha cambiato nome. Molto bello il palazzo, l'imponente ingresso e il salone, non molto attento il servizio. La nostra camera (409) pur bella e spaziosa e pulita non rifletteva però il lusso che si può aspettare da un 5 stelle L. Era chiaramente un'impostazione anni Ottanta e mai aggiornata agli standard moderni. ottima invece l'insonorizzazione interna ed esterna (che essendo su un vialone a grande traffico è importante) e il letto.

Altro problema erano i tempi di attesa dell'unico ascensore funzionante, che al mattino richiedeva 10 minuti buoni per essere disponibile. 

Abbiamo cenato una sera al ristorante Caelis, una stella michelin. Anche qui devo annotare che il menu fisso era molto buono mentre l'accompagnamento di 5 vini al calice lasciava molto a desiderare per qualità e abbinamento (con conseguente cerchio alla testa i giorno dopo). Servizio in sala da migliorare.

Ottima la SPA con massaggiatrici altamente professionali e molto brave a capire le esigenze di mia moglie. Ottimo (ma carissimo) il trasfer con limousine dall'aeroporto.",4,2015,04,11
29,Preciosooooo,Que sitio mas bonito. Limpio.  Iluminado.  Con wifi.  No me arrepiento de mi elección.

29,lujo a buen precio,"Fuimos a celebrar el cumpleaños de mi pareja  un fin de semana a Barcelona y nos dimos el gusto de pasar dos noches en este majestuoso hotel. La habitación era estupenda, preciosa, con una decoración exquisita clásica pero con garra y actualizada por una estupenda reforma. El baño grande con ducha, bañera y aseo separado, incluía un vestidor y todos los productos de cortesía de la marca "" l'occitane en provence"". Chimenea en la habitación (en desuso pero auténtica), y la televisión camuflada como si fuera un espejo sobre la chimenea. La relación calidad precio me pareció estupenda, pagas realmente lo que lo vale. El salón de la planta aja es digno de ver, los arreglos florales llenos de orquídeas y de flores exóticas naturales, ...preciosos y la atmosfera anclada en un pasado de opereta, digna de pagar 10€ por un café..... el desayuno en una salón patio muy especial era muy variado y rico. La habitación era de las normales, creo que todas eran superiores, pero no era ni suite ni nada extra. No hace falta. La situación muy buena para moverse por el centro de Barcelona, muy cerca había un bar restaurante típico de los de solera...que pena que no recuerdo del nombre, que tenía a parte del lleno asegurado y el ambiente, todo delicioso y de la tierra. Siempre es un placer volver a Barcelona.",5,2015,03,28
29,Lo que esperas..,"Un lujo de hotel... habitaciones maravillosas, situación inmejorable.. El trato del personal exelente y muy cercano.. te hacen sentir en todo momento como en tu casa. La reforma que le han hecho al hotel es impresionante... no tienen desperdicio todas las salas de hotel a cual mas hermosa y lujosa... precioso.
Por poner un pero, el buffet del desayuno quizas un poco corto de variedad comparado con otros hoteles de su nivel pero lo suplen con un servicio inmejorable. Pides lo que quieras y te lo hacen al momento . El trato de recepcion es exquisito sobretodo mención especial a Katerina, es un sol.
En resumen una estancia de lujo, comoda y sensacional. volveremos seguro.",5,2015,02,27
29,El mejor de Barcelona,"Para mi y mi familia es el mejor hotel de Barcelona por su ubicación, cerca de la Plaza de CATALUNYA, por su cocina y platos que te sirven, por su arquitectura por su atención personalizada por esto y por muchas cosas mas me baso en la calificación de este mi hotel favorito de Barcelona. Hemos ido muchas veces y cada vez gusta mas. Las habitaciones son bastante grandes.",5,2015,02,20

29,Un gran clásico,"Para celebrar las bodas de Oro nuestros hijos nos regalaron por sorpresa una estancia en el hotel Palace ya que nos casamos en este hotel hace 50 años. La habitación que daba a la Gran Vía era muy espaciosa y bonita y disponía de un baño llamado Romano, muy original. Todo el personal fue muy amable y servicial con nosotros, desde el portero hasta las camareras de las habitaciones. El desayuno se sirve en una sala llamada Jardín que nos recordó a los años 20. Los camareros que nos atendieron fueron muy amables y en todo momento pendientes de nosotros. El desayuno es muy variado y muy bueno. Gracias a todo el personal por hacernos sentir tan bien 50 años después.",5,2015,01,15
29,De lo mejor de Barcelona,"Es en mi opinión de lo mejor que hay ,y sobre todo una cosa que me encanta que es una tontería  , es un sanwich que hacen por la noche siempre que llego tarde y ya como es normal las cocinas están cerradas pero tienen un servicio de habitaciones 24H para tardones como yo estupendo.",5,2015,01,10
29,einfach ein traum!,"Wunderschönes Hotel, optimales Lage und ein erstklassiger Service. 

Ich habe mit meinem Freund ein wunderbares Wochenende im Palace verbracht. Es war einfach alles perfekt! Die Dekoration des Hotels versetzt Dich in die 20. Jahre zurück, es versprüht waren Glamour und Eleganz. Unser Zimmer war geräumig, mit toller Aussicht und ein traumhaftes Bad mit römischer Badewanne. Aber was das Hotel letztendlich ausmacht ist sein Service. Wir möchten uns hiermit sehr herzlich bedanken bei Katarina. Sie hat unseren Aufenthalt, mit professionellen Insider Tips, Restaurantempfehlungen zu einem unvergesslichen Erlebnis gemacht!

Camere grandi e ben arredate, saloni con mobilia antica. Anche se non mi sono occupato del costo, mi sono informato e i prezzi sono da un quattro stelle e non da un hotel che offre tutto questo quindi consiglio vivamente.",5,2014,11,27

29,Lebt vom verblassten Ruhm,"Leider ist nur noch die Halle im Parterre ein Schmuckstück geblieben. Der Empfang war sehr unfreundlich an einer Reception die eher an eine Abstellkammer erinnert. Beim Anmelden wurde das Personal vier Mal von einem Telefonanruf von uns getrennt. Wir kamen uns überhaupt nicht willkommen vor. So haben wir auch selber unser Zimmer gesucht und die Koffer mit genommen, der Concierge hatte ja grad m Telefon etwas zu besprechen. Das Zimmer war in Ordnung, bis auf den Zigarettengeschmack aus der Lüftung, welchen man mit Raumspray in unserem Zimmer beheben wollte. Sich verwöhnen lassen ist in diesem Hotel leider nicht möglich. Schade! Wir haben deshalb auf weitere Konsumationen an diesem Ort verzichtet und durften somit viel schönes in Barcelona erleben.",1,2014,11,09
29,impeccabile,"ospite 5 notti in questo hotel. ottimo ricevimento con presentazione del personale disponibile, professionale e soprattutto sorridente. saloni molto curati con mobilia antica. le camere sono grandi, mobilia nuova e letti grandi, possibilità di chiedere cuscini con varie dimensioni e  morbidezza, bagni  altrettanto grandi e il servizio è all altezza delle stelle che possiede. disponibilità anche del personale nell aiutarci per alcune prenotazioni ed attenti alle ns esigenze. ci siamo sentiti molto coccolati. un aspetto non trascurabile è il prezzo. abbiamo pagato lo stesso prezzo di un hotel 4 stelle ad arabba in italia che non aveva certo le stesse caratteristiche. consiglio anche per l ubicazione.ottimo per scoprire la città.

El ambiente es puro lujo, como si se tratara de un palacio.",5,2014,09,12
29,Che Hotel! ,"Se non siete amanti della classe vecchio stile, vi potrà sembrare austero. Al contrario a me è molto piaciuto, sia per come è ammobiliato sia per la posizione a pochi passi da Passeig de Gracia, Plaça Urquinaona e Plaça de Catalunya e dunque la Rambla. Le 5 stelle sono abbondantemente meritate per hotel di questo livello, le camere, anche le junior suite, sono comunque spaziose, comode e funzionali sia per le coppie che per famiglie. Da notare il bagno è veramente enorme, possiede stanzino per il gabinetto separato, poi in uno spazio più aperto esibisce due lavabi, una bella vasca idromassaggio e la doccia, veramente comoda. Se passate per Barcellona, passateci!
",5,2014,08,29
29,Ottimo hotel,"Ho soggiornato in questa struttura per cinque notti con tre figli, la più piccola di sei anni e l'hotel ha pienamente soddisfatto le attese.
L'hotel ha certo qualche pecca, non possedendo la precisione teutonica nei particolari, dovuta più a qualche leggerezza nella manutenzione, ma ho trovato tanta e tale disponibilità da parte di tutto il personale di servizio che certo può essere dimenticata.
Ottima pure la cena al ristorante ""informale"" ""Nineteen-19""; che non ho compreso perché da loro ritenuta di livello inferiore rispetto all'altro ristorante presente nella struttura, visto il servizio impeccabile, l'ottima qualità del cibo e l'ambientazione degna dei miglior ristoranti.
Un  bel soggiorno",5,2014,08,28
29,Gastlichkeit in Perfektion,"Aus der grossen Auswahl von Hotels haben wir das El Palace gewählt und wurden nicht enttäuscht. Es ist ein Leading Hotel und erfüllt diese Klasse mit Bravour.
Gleich, wo man ist oder was man macht, immer ist der Service höchst aufmerksam und zuvorkommend, ganz im Stile eines klassischen Grand-Hotels. Besonders ist der Concierge Bereich hervorzuheben.
Das Caelis Restaurant trägt den Stern mit Recht und besticht durch seine klassische - moderne Kombination. Aber auch die Bar im Untergeschoss mit Live Musik ist ein Schmuckstück. 
Die Zimmer sind mit allen Annehmlichkeiten versehen, ein Coffee Maker wäre da vielleicht noch das i-Tüpfelchen. Am besten ein nach hinten gelegenes Zimmer wählen, da ist es wirklich ruhig.
Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral an einer grossen Hauptstrasse, die ansonsten nicht viel zu bieten hat. Aber nach nur wenigen Schritte ist man mitten drin, sei es Passeig de Gracia, gotisches Viertel oder Born oder die Rambla (wem es gefällt).
Alles in allem eine klare Empfehlung, denn neben der ""Hardware"" ist es bei Hotels dieser Klasse eben der persönliche Service, der bleibende Eindrücke hinterlässt und den Wunsch nach einer baldigen Rückkehr.",5,2014,08,19
29,Hotel clásico de lujo..,"Una excelente ubicación, cerca de plaza Catalunia, pero el suficientemente lejos para estar en una zona muy tranquila y sin grande ruidos, el hotel mantiene su imagen de hotel del los años 1900, con un grand lujo y detalles de calidad.
Las habitaciones mantiene el estilo de ""palacio"" con detalles tecnológicos escondidos (como la tele!), el baño es grande y moderno con unos amenities de calidad superior!
En mi estancia he elegido el ""afternoon tea"", exquisito y muy rico, con varios tipos de te, sandwiches, scones y repostería.
El personal de primera calidad, siempre servicial y simpático.
Un verdadero lujo!",5,2014,08,12
29,Klasse Palace Hotel in zentraler Lage und kein alter Kasten,"Für ein verlängertes Wochenende und zum Freude treffen von der südlichen Halbkugel entschieden wir uns für Barcelona und hier für das El Palace Hotel. Die Buchung direkt im Hotel verlief problemlos und kompetent und billiger als über Veranstalter. Der Empfang war wie es sich für ein 5-Sterne Hotel der alten Schule gehört. Klasse. Der alte Charme wurde vermittelt und nicht nur gespielt doch trotzdem ist es keine alte Kiste, da es meiner Meinung nach aufwendig renoviert wurde. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig für ein Stadthotel in der Lage, perfekt sauber und ein absolut aufmerksamer Service. Das Frühstücksbüffet war sehr originell, mit lokalem Einschlag und absolut professionelle. Die Tagesbar war sehr gut. Ganz klasse war jedoch die Abendbar im Keller, fast ein kleiner Club. Klasse Cocktails. und es gibt für Zigarrenraucher sogar eine extra Bar nebenan - alles sehr intim. Die Concierge werden ihrem Berufsstand absolut gerecht. Von hier aus kann man alles zu Fuss erreichen. Also immer wieder gerne. Outstanding ist allerdings das Restaurant.",5,2014,07,09

29,"Un vero ""Grand Hotel""","L'albergo è molto elegante e accogliente. Resta in una posizione centrale e così si può raggiungere la maggior parte delle attrazioni a piedi. Bagni spaziosi e stanze arredate con molto gusto. Attulamente purtroppo vi sono dei lavori in corso nell'immobile accanto, però i ""rumori"" iniziano solo dalle 9.00 via. D'altronde non bisogna dimenticarsi che si è in una grandissima città e soprattutto che solitamente di giorno si è comunque in giro per musei o per le mille altre attrazioni che offre Barcellona. Il buffet della colazione è molto ricco e la veranda è incantevole. i concierge sono stati molto disponibili per consigliare ed eseguire le riservazioni nei vari ristoranti la sera. Non dimenticate però di riservare via internet (minimo 3 giorni prima) i vari biglietti per i musei, sagrada familia, parco güell, ecc... così vi risparmiate inutili attese. Fortunatamente era bel tempo, per questo motivo non ho usufruito dello SPA e della palestra. Per questo motivo manca un commento da parte mia.",4,2014,06,08

Esta ubicado en una esquina es un edificio magestuoso y muy bien conservado, cerca de Plaza Catalunia pero no en pleno bullicio.

Ya estamos pensando en volver a ir el próximo año.",5,2014,05,20
29,"Correcto, pero puede más","El Palace esta obligado a ser uno de los ""grandes""  en Europa; la Ciudad, la historia y el edificio lo merecen.

La estancia ha sido  positiva, si bien esperamos más y estamos seguros de que en un futuro próximo así será.",4,2014,05,18

Unser Zimmer war geräumig, behaglich eingerichtet und mit einem ""römischen Bad"" ausgestattet"". Restaurant und Frühstück haben wir nicht ausprobiert, da es uns eher in die Tapabars und kleinen Frühstückslokale zog.

29,En lo gastronómico son de lo mejor,"Estuve hace unas semanas con un grupo de amigas para degustar un afternoon tea en el restaurante 19/Nineteen. El afternoon tea que sirven en el hotel Palace es el típico inglés y creo que es el único lugar de la ciudad donde poderlo degustar igual que en Inglaterra. El afternoon tea se separa en tres partes: la primera se degustan sándwiches, la segunda scones con clotted cream y la tercera se degusta una deliciosa repostería fina. El afternoon tea se tiene que reservar con antelación y cuesta 28€ por persona.",3,2014,05,06

El servicio es inmejorable. Tuvieron con nosotros algunas atenciones al saber que celebrábamos nuestro aniversario de boda y lo agradecemos mucho pues ayudó a hacer nuestra estancia aún más especial.
En nuestra boda estuvimos en la suite Dalí, en esta ocasión hemos estado en una de las habitaciones dobles con baño romano y si bien no es lo mismo que estar en la suite, solo puedo darle un diez.
Cenamos en el Caelis, el restaurante del Palace con estrella michelin y fué un verdadero placer para el paladar.
El desayuno en el jardin es también muy agradable, la calidad del bufet es excepcional y el ambiente fresco y acogedor.

Si trova in una posizione invidiabile a circa 20 minuti di taxi dall' aereoporto ( circa 30 euro) a due passi dalla plaza de catalunya, a 5 minuti a piedi dalla rambla. La fermata della metro è a 30 metri
le camere sono molto spaziose c'è un letto enorme, molto curate.pulitissime e semre tenute in ordine. In camera c'è tutto quello che si vuole tvled ac frigobar ( a prezzi diciamo accessibili)
La camera era la 408 con una finiestra diretta sulla piazza di fronte all'hotel.
personale molto gentile cortese e disponibile, ci hanno dato cartina e tutte le info col sorriso.
Non abbiamo cenato in hotel ma consiglio di fare un giro alla sera dopo le 23 nella saletta interrata perchè spesso ci sono dei gruppi che fanno musica ( cover) davvero di qualità.
Unica pecca la spa. Non è possibile accedervi se non per fare trattamenti a pagamento tipo massaggi ecc.. non si può fare una sauna o un bagno turco o altro come in una SPA tradizionale. c'e anche una piccola palestra",5,2014,03,31

Los sandwiches deliciosos, los scones aunque algo diferentes a los de allí estaban riquísimos, las mermeladas y la Clotted Crem perfectas y los pastelitos riquísimos.

Las habitaciones están bien aisladas: teníamos a una pareja con su bebé en la habitación de al lado, y ya estamos sufriendo porque no queríamos pasar la noche con lloros... pero ni nos enteramos.

Destacar que es muy centrico.
Si encaja en tu presupuesto, vale la pena ir.",5,2014,01,24
29,Afternoon Tea esplendido,"Un hotel fantástico, aunque no disfrutamos de sus habitaciones, una forma especial de hacerlo en una experiencia especial es el AfternoonTea. Lo decidimos regalar a una amiga como sorpresa y nos encantó a todas. El entorno especial, y productos de calidad y cantidad con muy buen servicio.

Nos encantó y lo recomendamos para una experiencia diferente en un entorno fantástico. si no se puede ir a Londres, recomendamos difrutar en Barcelona

29,Fantástico hotel,"El hotel Palace es muy recomendable por muchos motivos. Por su ubicación, en pleno centro de Barcelona. Por su servicio, amable y eficiente. Por su tranquilidad, las habitaciones son cómodas y silenciosas. Y hasta recomiendo, si vais con niños, el servicio de babysitter. Son trabajadoras del hotel que trabajan también de canguros por lo que te da mucha confianza. Mi hijo, de 6 años, todavía recuerda a Isabel que le cuidó durante unas horas.",5,2013,12,27
29,Cosa aspettarsi di più,"Sono stato tre notti in questo albergo, esperienza meravigliosa. Personale professionale, gentile e sorpresa disponibile. Le camere spaziose, pulite e ben arredate, bagno grandissimo, il tutto trasferiva un senso di nuovo. Non centralissimo ma in cinque minuti si raggiungeva la Rambla. Avevo prenotato su booking.com, approfittando di un'offerta, ho speso come un buon 4 stelle. All'arrivo mi hanno comunicato di avermi riservato un upgrade. Consigliatissimo.",5,2013,12,08

Ist auch zurecht in THW member, jedoch fehlt bei den Duschen ein Étagere, da man sich fürs Shampoo immer bücken musste. Daher auch der Punkteabzug, da dies ein no-go ist in einem 5 Sterne Hotel! Frühstücksbüffet war sehr gut und man hatte auch großzügig Platz! Ambiente sehr schön, lediglich die Klimaanlage im Frühstückssaal war zu kalt eingestellt.

29,SI PUÒ EVITARE NON CORRISPONDE AI CANONI DI UN LEADING,"Ci sono alberghi con posizione migliore sicuramente, e' decentrato dal mare, non ha una spiaggia privata per gli ospiti, all'arrivo e' improbabile che qualcuno corra a prendere bagagli e vettura, nessuno ti apre la porta, le stanze son desuete e con andamento approssimativo, e costano più delle camere dell'hermitage di Montecarlo unico forse vero leading visitato. Arredamento delle stanze molto approssimativo. Considerate approssimativo, abiti desueti e mai indossati. Il portiere se non è intento a leggere il giornale ti apre la porta.

29,Lussuoso,"E’ l'ex Ritz finemente riistrutturato negli scorsi anni e per il quale si sono mantenuti, quanto possibile, ambienti e decorazioni originali. Grandi saloni, ampie stanze e bagni con un mix di decorazioni del tempo (es. vasca a incasso con mosaici) e soluzioni moderne (doccia 1,5 mt x 1,5 mt con soffione pioggia). Televisione in camera a scomparsa dietro lo specchio sopra un camino veramente bello. Aria condizionata per tutti i gusti (volendo si può avere freddo ...). Connessione internet free con possibile upgrade premium. Letto king size molto comodo, camere perfettamente insonorizzate: si dorme veramente bene. Gentilezza e professionalità. Non abbiamo visitato la SPA (non ci ha attratto + costi troppo alti). Concordo con il non fare la colazione in albergo; se si fa il turista, Barcellona è piena di caffetterie simpatiche nelle vicinanze. Ottima posizione: pochi minuti e si raggiunge Passeig de Gracia (negozi + casa Batillò e Casa Pedrera) o Placa de Catalunya da dove parte la Rambla e dove c’è il capolinea del comodo Aereobus per Airport Terminal 1 e/o Terminal 2.  Quindi: costi sicuramente importanti, ma “c’è della sostanza"" ;-)",4,2013,07,14

L'hotel è bellissimo, con splendidi saloni e belle stanze munite di ogni confort. Ottima la posizione per girare comodamente la città; soprattutto eccezionale l'ospitalità da parte di tutto il personale a partire dal direttore e dalla meravigliosa Céline, bellissima ed insostituibile. Ottima e assai varia la colazione. Abbiamo mangiato presso il ristorante Caelis: cibo molto buono e servizio assai attento e cortese. Tutto il personale si è impegnato a rendere il nostro soggiorno indimenticabile, superando con abilità e professionalità ogni piccolo inconveniente. 
Sicuramente lo consigliamo a tutti.",5,2013,06,12

Posto elegante e perfetto per un piccolo break in una città veramente divertente e vivace. Prezzo caro ma allineato alla città, unico neo il prezzo elevato della colazione, ma essendo circaondato da ristoranti e bar la colazione si può facilmente farla anche solo attraversando la strada. Raccomandato.",4,2013,06,10
29,Un pezzo di storia spagnola,"In questo albergo sono passati tutti ma propio tutti quelli che hanno contato nella storia spagnola dell'ultimo secolo.Re,regine,dittatori ,attori attrici, toreri e l'aria che si respira nell'hotel ne conserva traccia nelle strutture eleganti e formali ed un poco molto ""art deco"".L'albergo e stato completamente ristrutturato e molto bene anche : le stanze sono comode e confortevoli ,i bagni tutti nuovi ed il servizio molto attento e professionale.Non parliamo poi della posizione al centro di Barcellona e comoda con tutto.Unico elemento negativo i prezzi che non sono propio popolari ma ne vale la pena .",5,2013,05,25
29,Afternoon Tea exquisito!!,"Con unas amigas tuvimos la idea de buscar un sitio distinguido en Barcelona para tomarnos el famoso ""High Tea"" británico. Tuvimos la suerte de que en El Palace nos lo organizaron encantados y, la verdad, fue igual que en Londres! No faltaba ningún detalle auténtico: sandwiches variados rectangulares, scones con pasas, clotted cream (deliciosa!!), mermelada de frutos rojos y naranja amarga, y pastelería francesa; además, por supuesto, del surtido de tés (que tomamos el English Breakfast con leche) y cafés. Toda la comida era extraordinaria, y también lo fueron el servicio y la puesta en escena: las tazas, platos, cubertería y demás enseres eran justamente los propios de esta celebración británica. Sin duda, lo recomendamos por su exquisitez, exclusividad, buen servicio y privilegio de poder hacer una celebración así en pleno centro de Barcelona.",5,2013,05,21
29,Ausgezeichnet!,"wir waren 12 Tageb im Palace Hotel....wunderbar.  Die Lage ist mehr als gut.  Mann ist in 5 Min. in der Altstadt und an die Ramblas, hat aber totale Ruhe.

Está localizado a unas cuadras de el Paseo de Gracia, así que tiene clase, ubicación, servicio y excelente cocina.",5,2013,05,08
29,Elegante e raffinato,"Ho trascorso quattro giorni con la famiglia in questo hotel situato al centro di Barcellona. 
Innanzitutto la posizione: è ottima, essendo a due passi dal Passeig de Gracia (zona con i migliori negozi) e da Placa de Catalunya (ramblas e città vecchia).
L'hotel è stato recentemente ristrutturato e quindi tutto è nuovo. 
Le camere sono spaziose, dotate di ogni confort: nonostante la posizione su un viale molto trafficato, l'insonorizzazione è ottima e quindi la camera è risulta molto silenziosa. 
Il personale è gentile e premuroso. 
Il prezzo non si può certo dire economico, ma è in linea con le 5 stelle dell'albergo.
Peccato per la wifi che nelle camere aveva il segnale molto debole, costringendo a ricollegarsi ogni pochi minuti.

In conclusione un ottimo hotel da consigliare per chi deve andare a Barcellona.",4,2013,04,29
29,Maestoso,"Direi di un lusso sfrenato!
Le camere sono bellissime, letti fantastici con dei materassi meravigliosi ( possibilità di scegliere anche il cuscino con cui dormire) ; bagno molto ampio stra pulito dotato di ogni confort!

29,Lo mejor en Barcelona !,"Barcelona es mi ciudad de corazón y con El Palace, mi experiencia se transformó en experiencia única.
Estaba con mi pareja en una habitación Deluxe, había una chimenea como en Paris ! Es una habitación muy amplia con vista a la Gran Via y podía ver la Sagrada Familia… preguntar por la 504 o 503 ! Me gustó muchísimo. Lo mejor de mi estancia fue el personal del hotel ! Había un maletero que hablaba francés y tenía una sonrisa más grande que su cara, se llamaba Xavi. Después conocí a Alexis y Francisco que nos cuidaron muchísimo y como decimos en francés : « la cerise sur le gâteau » habia Celine y Katarina, dos guest relations de maravilla que nos cuidaron del primer al último día. Pasamos una estancia increíble gracias a todo este mundo que nos hizo sentir como en casa. Esperemos volver muy pronto !",5,2013,03,15
29,Hotel de lujo,"Soy un fan absoluto de este hotel. Las últimas cinco veces que he tenido que viajar a Barcelona me he hospedado en él y no ha habido ni una sola ocasión en la que no me hayan sorprendido la cantidad de detalles de lujo que he visto en mis estancias.

A parte de la comodidad que supone el gran espacio del que disponen sus habitaciones y baños, el desayuno es espectacular, se sirve en un patio calefactado donde no falta detalle.

En resumen, una experiencia muy muy recomendable.",5,2013,03,14
29,UN CAMBIO SIN PERDER LA ESENCIA,"Como profesional del sector turístico he conocido el Palace (Ritz) desde hace muchos años. He vivido la historia de la larga reforma en la que cabía el riesgo de perder la esencia del hotel por plegar ante las necesidades de las nuevas tendencias. Un riesgo que se ha corrido en parte y con éxito.
El salvar integramente las zonas sociales, simplemente actualizando y embelleciendo lo ya existente ha hecho que el Palace siga siendo lo que era: un clásico. Donde había que cambiar y actualizar, que era en las habitaciones, se ha hecho con gusto y estilo, dándo tanto a los pasillos como a las propias habitaciones un confort contemporaneo con un estilo muy identificable. Los baños son espectaculares y la insonorización hacia la Gran Via realmente buena.
Si que apuntaría una corrección importante, y es la iluminación del magnífico patio de desayunos. Se ha pretendido que sea tan cálida que ha acabado en una luz engañosa que no permite distinguir los colores de los productos del buffet, donde los rojos se confunden con los naranjas y los marrones. 
El Palace sigue siendo el Palace (Ritz), afortunadamente",4,2012,12,20
29,"Lo mejor su equipo humano, es la esencia del Ritz.","La reforma integral ha valido la pena, alhora es el Hotel sin duda de Barcelona.  Las modas pasaran pero el Palace estará allí, su calidad inigualable y lo mejor su personal.
La habitación ámplia, cama extra grande, amenities occitane y el baño de ensueño. Os recomiendo La Privilege 326, quien la ha visto y quien la ve. Por la noche disfrutamos de Jazz en directo, Bisedo excelente Gintonic.
La terraza ofrece un desayuno personalitzado y de excelente calidad. 
Despues de muchos años he regresado para celebrar mis 40 años, espero no tardar tanto en regresar y ver a tantos amigos. Mariano y Gwen, un abrazo eterno.",5,2012,12,01

29,Agradable,"Era el antiguo hotel Ritz,y tiene el lujo de los hoteles de su epoca , si bien le falta la grandiosidad asociada a estos hoteles, puesto que elas dimensiones se adaptan a los inmuebles de la zona. Así la recepción no es muy grande y tiene un solo salón. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y el baño está reformado recientemente. El equipamiento es escaso para un hotel de esta categoria y precio, ni un peine, ni cepillo de dientes ni utiles de afeitar. El personal es muy ataento y amable. El bufet del desayuno podia mejorar, y tener una mejor presentación, si bien es de buena calidad. Es caro",4,2012,11,18

Es acogedor, con una sensación de lujo tranquilo y sin estridencias. Excelente desayuno. Se puede acceder caminando a buena parte de las atracciones de la ciudad.",5,2012,11,07
29,Los hoteles en Barcelona son muy caros,"Los hoteles en Barcelona son muy caros y este no es una excepción teniendo en cuenta que tiene 5 estrellas, la habitación doble cuesta un pico por noche con el desayuno incluido. En Berlín pagamos por una doble con desayuno buffet en el centro y 4 estrellas mas, en el mes de agosto. Quitando el precio, aunque todos son igual de carísimos, es un buen hotel muy bien situado.",4,2012,11,05
29,El lujo de los Reyes...,"He estado recientemente en este hotel desayunando, y la verdad que al entrar en el lujoso establecimiento se te ponen los pelos de punta del lujo que se respira. Los salones son bonitos, decorados con mucho gusto, pero un gusto muy recargado, aún así, la belleza del lugar te deja atónito. El personal es muy amable y educado, el espacio donde tiene lugar el desayuno no es igual de elegante como los salones interiores, ya que se ofrece en una carpa que da a una pequeña terraza con una fuente. El bufé es variado, hay zumos, (2 clases), fruta, jamón ibérico, (lo mejor) para mi gusto sobraban unos tallarines que había al vapor, y lo sustituiría por mas variedad en pastelería y repostería ya que debido a la imagen y categoría del hotel uno espera ver esas tartas, pasteles y croissants de mantequilla. 
Pero la verdad que es un hotel fabuloso para ir una vez en la vida!!",4,2012,11,02
29,Traumhaftes Hotel,"Wahnsinnig traumhaftes Hotel, es gibt nichts zu bemängeln.
Das Zimmer war sehr groß für ein Standardzimmer mit traumhaften Badezimmer. 
Das Frühstücksbüffet muss man einfach mit buchen! Super viel Auswahl mit süßen und herzhaften Leckereien in einem tollen Ambiente. Spätestens bei der hausgemachten Schokocreme war ich überzeugt!
Ich kann das Hotel ohne schlechtes Gewissen weiterempfehlen! Ruhig etwas mehr Geld ausgeben, dafür aber Top zufrieden sein!",5,2012,10,17
29,Ein Traum von einem Hotel,"Meine Freundin und ich haben ein verlängertes Wochenende im El Palace verbracht, und obwohl ich normalerweise sehr kritisch bin, kann ich dieses Hotel uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen. Das Ambiente, der Service, das Frühstück, alles war erstklassig. Unser Zimmer war ein Traum, und die Badewanne mit Whirlpool-Funktion muss man einfach ausprobiert haben. Das Personal war sehr  aufmerksam, ohne dabei aufdringlich zu sein. Sogar für Zigarren-Liebhaber ist mit einer eigenen Lounge gesorgt. Alles in allem ein Traum von einem Hotel.",5,2012,10,15
29,"Excelente hotel, muy buen servicio","Es un hotel elegante, que cuida muy bien los detalles y su decoración tipo colonial, por algo es el antiguo hotel Ritz. Las habitaciones son amplias y cómodas, y el servicio es excelente.
Como punto negativo es que no cuenta con WiFi gratuito en las habitaciones y para un hotel de este precio y de esta categoría considero que es algo básico.",5,2012,10,08
29,El hotel clásico de Barcelona. Instalaciones y habitaciones dignas de su categoría,"Me alojé al Hotel Palace de Barcelona durante tres noches con mi pareja. 
El hotel sin duda es una maravilla y ha sabido conservar el gran lujo que tenía cuando pertenecía a la cadena Ritz.
En mi opinión, actualmente es Husa El Palace es mejor que el antiguo Ritz de Barcelona, cuyo hotel es el mismo pero en la actualidad pertenece a la cadena Husa.

Completamente de acuerdo con su actual categoría de cinco estrellas gran lujo y también de acuerdo en que este selecto hotel pertenezca a ""The Leading Hotels of the World"".
Para mi es uno de los hoteles de referencia en la ciudad condal.

El Palace está situado cerca de la Plaza Urquinaona, a unos 25 minutos andando del Paseo de Gracia y a menos de un cuarto de hora de Plaza Catalunya.
Sin duda goza de una estratégica situación en el corazón de Barcelona, en plena Gran Via.
El hotel por fuera es elegante. Se encuentra en un edificio neoclásico muy bien conservado.

Pero por dentro el establecimiento es impresionante.
De estilo completamente clásico, el Palace de Barcelona sin duda es uno de los hoteles más lujosos y exclusivos de la ciudad en mi opinión.
Sus inmensos salones parecen propios del Palacio de Versalles.

Y sus habitaciones son impresionantes. Reservamos la habitación Classic Deluxe (la más sencilla) y era algo fuera de lo común incluso en un hotel de 5* GL. La habitación aunque era bastante clásica también tenía muchos toques de modernidad, sobretodo en el baño. Además de que la habitación era muy grande y ámplia. Poseía de una selección de artículos de baño de la marca l'Occitane en Provençe, algo casi imposible de ver en cualquier hotel de lujo. Sin duda, todo un lujo y te sientes como en casa.

Te ofrecen en todo momento un trato muy exclusivo y también muy acogedor.
El hotel cuenta también con un Spa. Muy lujoso y de ambiente maya. Más que un Spa es un área de relajación donde se hacen tratamientos.

Y por último sobredestacar la magnífica restauración del establecimiento.
Comimos en sus dos restaurantes, el Caelis y el AE.
Los dos tienen un precio muy elevado (sobretodo el Caelis) pero merece la pena.
En el AE sirven comida a un precio más razonable. Muy recomendable, se trata de alta gastronomía y un servicio exclusivo.
Pero el Caelis es bastante mejor que el AE. Tiene una estrella Michelín, comprensible también que el precio de sus platos sean tan elevados. Pero a mi personalmente no me pareció tan caro en relación a lo bien que se come en el Caelis. Servicio impecable, gastronomía muy elaborada... simplemente perfecto.
Y por último su sala de desayunos,donde sirven unos desayunos maravillosos con una gran calidad y variedad de productos.

Y luego hay sus dos bares. El del Hall y el ""Rien de Rien"", donde hacen unos cócteles con un glamour y una solera de 5* GL.

No dudaré a volver de nuevo al Palace, me ha impresionado.
Felicitar a todo el personal del hotel, sois todos magníficos.",5,2012,09,20
29,Tolles Hotel in Barcelona,"Ein tolles Hotel, zentral gelegen, schöne Zimmer, sehr aufmerksamer Service. Man fühlt sich wohl in diesen Hause. Wir werden das nächste Mal wieder dort einkehren.

29,Sconsigliato   agli  allergici............,"Sono  sempre  stato  un  buon  cliente  di  questo  grande  albergo,  ma  questa  volta  non  ho   potuto dormirci.  La   causa  ?   :  appena  si  entra  nella  hall  e  nella  reception  si  e'  letteralmente  invasi  da  forti  profumi  installati   da  poco  tempo   da  diffusori   in  ogni   angolo dell'hotel.  Questi  profumi  sono  nocivi  a  chi  non  li  sopporta  e  sono  nocivi  anche  perche' sono  prodotti  chimici   che  si  mischiono  con  l'aria. Il  Palace  ha  perso  un  cliente (anche  se  perticolare) !!",1,2012,08,31
29,Eleganza e raffinatezza,"Albergo di grande fascino. Ubicato in pieno centro. Camera lussuosa, arredata com grande gusto. Il servizio efficiente, pumtuale e gentile. Grande pulizia on. Camera e negli spazi comuni. Colazione abbondante e varia fatta in una sala di grande apsfera. Giudizio piu' che positivo.

",5,2012,08,26
29,molto buono con qualche pecca,"la mia esperienza in quest'albergo è stata senz'altro positiva anche se con qualche inconveniente che non mi sarei aspettata in un 5 stelle lusso. Infatti al nostro arrivo, giacchè le camere non erano ancora pronte abbiamo chiesto in portineria di lasciare li  due giornali per poi farceli trovare più tardi  in camera . Al nostro rientro i giornali non c'erano nè il portiere ha saputo dirci che fine avessero fatto.A parte ciò il mio giudizio su questo hotel è positivo la struttura è molto bella ,lussuosa e ben tenuta, splendida la sala veranda della prima colazione, buono e vario il cibo,servizio accurato e cortese sia la mattina a colazione che la sera nel ristorante AE dove abbiamo cenato; le stanze sono belle comode e pulite, noi avevamo 2 deluxe . Inoltre l'hotel è ubicato in un bel viale tranquillo ma vicinissimo a tutti i luoghi più interessanti della bella barcellona",4,2012,07,08
29,Un antiguo gran hotel.,"El hotel conserva su ""solera"" de antaño.  La recepción muy pequeña.  La habitación de superior categoría con antesala y un escritorio precioso.

29,gran lusso al centro di barcellona,"volendo soggiarnare al centro di barcellona abbiamo deciso di scegliere questo classico dell'ostelleria europea, ex ritz. la posizione e' perfetta per raggiungere comodamente a piedi  la cattedrale, la rambla e le case di gaudi'. lo sfarzoso salone della hall sembra uscito da una scena del gattopardo, merita da solito la visita (le foto su internet non gli rendono merito),  la consierge professionale e disponibile x ogni desiderio del cliente, le camere con un elegantissimo arredo classico e dei bagni completi di vasca e doccia separata con soffione da 40 x 40... un ristorante stellato michelin... cos'altro desiderare di meglio ? spettacolare.",5,2012,03,08

- elegantes und stilvolles Zimmer
- phantastisches Bad
- Fenster lassen sich trotz leisester Klimaanlage auch öffnen
- wunderschöner Aufenthaltsbereich
- perfekter und netter Service
- top Lage, ca. 2 Min zu Fuß zum Pg Gracia, der Haupteinkaufsstrasse
- ruhiges Zimmer, wir konnten mit offenem Fenster schlafen

Wir kennen viele 5* Häuser weltweit, dieses kann locker in der obersten Liga mitspielen. Es gab wirklich nichts zu kritisieren. 
Das Sternerestaurant und den Spa haben wir allerdings nicht probiert, sahen aber auch sehr schön aus.
Wir würden jederzeit wieder hier wohnen!",5,2012,02,24
29,Top del top ma con qualche caduta di stile,"Ho soggiornato per 2 notti in questo bellissimo Hotel 5 stelle lusso (ex Ritz) nella Privilege Junior Suite.
Sono solito soggiornare in hotel gran lusso ma il ""GL"" di questo albergo è troppo.
La camera,di grande dimensione,mi ha colpito per l'arredamento di buon gusto e per le tv 42 pollici locate sia nel salottino che nella stanza da letto.
La colazione in camera (32 euro a persona) è stata ricca e buonissima.
La pulizia eccellente ed il personale cordialissimo ( 10 Euro di mancia minima senno non ti filano più di tanto).
Il bagno: unica pecca? la mancanza del Bidet!!!!!!!!!!!! può un albergo ""GL"" (gran lusso) non avere il bidet nei propri Bagni????????
per questo le stelle a mio parere scendono a 3!!!
La braserie la consiglio nonchè la SPA che è divina,una delle migliori che io abbia mai provato (120 euro a massaggio da 50 minuti).
Diciamo che tranne per la questione bidet,il resto ha soddisfatto una persona esigente come me e la mia ragazza.
Ve lo consiglio ma sappiate che la voste igene intima dovrà essere locata nella doccia o nella vasca da bagno.",4,2012,02,14
29,Grandhotel der großen alten Schule,"für viele das erste Haus am Platze, und ich kann es bestätigen. Der fin-de-siecle Stil lässt an das Hotel Imperial in Wien oder die großen alten Grandhotels erinnern. Schon die Lobby mit der gigantischen von Goldintarsien, Marmorsäulen, Gobelins und Bilder umsäumten Umgebung ist tief beeindruckend. Der Service ist professionell und engagiert, keinesfalls hochnäsig wie es dann und wann in Vergleichshotels vorkommen mag. Die Standardzimmer sind ausreichend groß, in jedem Detail liebevoll im fin de siecle Stil möbliert und das Bad sehr schön. Das Frühstück lässt in puncto Vielfalt (Kaffeequalität, frisch gepresste Säfte, Aufmerksamkeit des Service, gesunde Elemente, sehr viel Obst) keinen Wunsch offen. Nicht billig, aber jeden Cent wert!",5,2012,01,23
29,Lo sceglierei ancora!,"Ci siamo trovati davvero benissimo in questo hotel. La posizione è perfetta per visitare la città, centrale e vicinissimo anche a piedi ai luoghi di maggior interesse turistico, il quartiere dell'Eixample è tranquillissimo anche di notte. Abbiamo soggiornato in una junior suite molto ampia, curata e pulitissima nonostante la moquette (letto king comodissimo e sala da bagno altrettanto grande e nuova)...qui il disign era più sobrio rispetto all'ingresso e alla sala lobby, molto più pomposa ma egualmente piacevole e di grande effetto scenico. Ottimo il buffet a colazione. Rapporto qualità/prezzo ottimo! Non avrei dubbi a sceglierlo ancora!",5,2012,01,22
29,Hotel di gran classe,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia in questo magnifico hotel dal 3 al 6 gennaio; situato nel cuore di Barcellona, offre tutto quanto ci si può aspettare da un albergo della sua categoria.
L'ambiente è raffinato e tranquillo, la hall è imponente, ma al tempo stesso accogliente e raccolta, è veramente piacevole rilassarsi sui morbidi divani dopo aver trascorso la giornata visitando la movimentata Barcellona.
Le camere sono ampie, lussuosamente arredate e dotate di ogni comfort, la nostra, situata al quinto piano con affaccio sul cortile interno, era molto silenziosa. Impeccabile la pulizia sia della camera che delle parti comuni.
La colazione, servita nella bella veranda invernale, presenta una grande varietà di cibi e bevande, tutti di eccellente qualità. 
Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile a soddisfare ogni esigenza del cliente.",5,2012,01,12

29,Un 5 * en todo el conjunto,Pasamos un fin de semana fantástico. Las habitaciones de estilo clásico renovado. Late check out hasta las 18. El restaurante caelis con una estrella michelin espectacular. Pub con muy buena música en directo. Todo un 5* ,5,2011,12,19
29,HOTEL DI LUSSO (E DI PREZZO),"Come posizione abbastanza comoda per visitare Barcellona, sulla Gran Via a 500 metri da Placa Catalugna. E' un 5 stelle ex Ritz e avrebbe bisogno di qualche adeguamento. Colazione molto varie, anche se le uova strapazzate erano fredde. Pacheggio 30 euro a notte. Stanza oltre 300 euro rumorosa. Personale non gentilissimo. Per un piccolo incidente, una lampada caduta per terra e crepatosi un pezzo di ceramica, hanno addebitato 150 euro (lampada che non valeva quel prezzo neppure da nuova) Non credo ci tornerei.",2,2011,11,27
29,Gran lusso,"Tutto al top, camera spaziosa bellissima pulizia ambienti al massimo, ambiente raffinato, un hotel da consigliare a chi pretende il massimo da un soggiorno. Unico neo il rumore della metro che si avverte durante la nottata e le finestre lato interno non sonorizzate. Noi eravamo al 2 piano junior suit. Posizione ottima. ",5,2011,11,08
29,El mejor hotel de lujo en Barcelona,"He tenido la suerte de estar en todos los hoteles de lujo de Barcelona y sin duda este es el mejor. Hacia tiempo que no iba, porque antes se había quedado algo anticuado, sin embargo, con la nueva reforma ha quedado maravilloso. Mantiene todo su estilo de lujo clásico, un punto rococó, que lo hace distinto del resto de oferta (tan igual) de la ciudad. Pero todo todo es nuevo, del mobiliario a las tapicerías, con mucho gusto e inversión. la estancia ha sido excelente, el trato de verdad lujoso. la junior suite grande y muy cómoda, buenos tv, gran baño, en fin, todo muy bien",5,2011,11,07
29,Ottimo Hotel peccato per la metro!,"L'albergo é un ex Ritz e si vede subito anche da fuori. La hall é fantastica con uno stile impeccabile. Il servizio non è veloce ma fulmineo. La colazione molto abbondante e di qualità da cinque stelle viene servita in un giardino coperto veramente gradevole. Le camere hanno gli spazi giusti, i bagni grandi con vasca e doccia separati. L'arredamento è impeccabile. Purtroppo per me ha un enorme difetto, poveretti, che non é eliminabile: è collocato sopra il passaggio della metro, quindi dalle 5,30 del mattino inizia il classico rumore che a mio giudizio distrugge l'atmosfera. Per carità non è un rumore assordante però si sente ovunque dalla hall alle camere (ero al secondo piano non so se più in alto sia meglio).",4,2011,10,31
29,come a Versailles ma con l'idromassaggio!,"non è soltanto che El Palace è un hotel 5 stelle GL ... chiaro che sia bellissimo! ma c'è qualche cosa di più ... nell'atmosfera raffinata ma calda, nel profumo misterioso che accoglie e stupisce ogni volta che si entra nella hall, nelle camere perfette e confortevoli ..
forse anche la dimensione raccolta e la gentilezza del personale che ti chiama per nome.
Noi fuggiamo sempre dai mega albergoni super blasonati ormai un po' polverosi con le hall incasinate che sembrano la stazione centrale dei treni! El Palace è stata una inaspettata sorpresa. Anche il ristorante è molto buono, stellato michelin.
La prima colazione divina, in uno spazio luminoso semi aperto tipo veranda d'inverno.
insomma siamo stati lì qualche giorno, avrei voluto viverci per sempre!!!",5,2011,10,17
29,Sublime!,"Nos alojamos en este fantástico hotel en nuestra visita a Barcelona y no nos decepciono en absolutato. Desde su arquitectura magníficamente cuidada hasta el ultimo de los detalles, todo es lujo y confort. El personal sumamente atento y dispuesto. Las habitaciones muy espaciosas, la nuestra había sido reformada recientemente y estaba muy bonita, siempre conservando el estilo del hotel. La ubicación es inmejorable, bien céntrico. Elativo en el que sirven el desayuno es muy bonito y el desayuno variado y exquisito. Vale la pena conocerlo!",5,2011,10,03
29,el mejor ubicado,"es el antiguo ritz de la ciudad. esta totalmente renovado. buenos cuartos, amplios. nosotros estuvimos en uno con baño con hidromasaje y ducha separada pero no tenia videt, cosa que me extraño. el gimnasio es tal como lo vi en una foto, muy pobre, solo dos cintas, dos bicicletas fijas y un escalador y nada mas. la atencion de todo el personal impecable, muy buen servicio. hay algunas cosas como los pocos ascensores que se entienden en funcion de mantener la estructura del edificio original. buena iluminacion. el desayuno se sirve en un jardin de invierno, bien equilibrado entre tipicas cosas españolas, variedad de frutas y pasteleria. es muy complicado conectarse a internet con un sistema de codigos interminables que hay que volver a colocar cada vez que vuelves a prender la computadora",4,2011,09,20
29,"Muy lindo hotel, le falta pisina urgente!! y cojines en las camas.","Este es un muy lindo hotel, lo raro es que las camas no tenian cojines. Esta bastante central el personal muy amable y los baños son comodisimo las piezas super grandes. Lo unico malo es que no tenga una terraza con pisina seria la unica razon por la que no volveria en Verano. 

",4,2011,08,25
29,Fantástico!!!,"He viajado mucho y me he alojado en excelentes hoteles, pero la experiencia en El Palace ha sido inmejorable. El ambiente, el servicio atento en todo momento, hacen de una estancia en este hotel una experiencia memorable.",5,2011,08,22
29,Magnifico nel cuore di Barcellona,"Appena siamo arrivati non credevamo ai nostri occhi,un hotel davvero molto elegante nel cuore pulsante di Barcellona a duecento metri dalla fermata metro di Urquinoa e a circa 500 metri da Plaza de Catalunya.
Camera spaziosa,elegante e pulita,bagno grande e fornito sia di ampia doccia che di vasca,noi avevamo scelto la camera standard.Colazione in camera ricchissima sia di cibi dolci che salati ad un prezzo accessibile,32 euro,ma siamo sempre in un albergo di lusso...
Unico appunto:la seconda sera non ci è stata preparata la stanza per la notte,questo non deve succedere in un 5 stelle.",4,2011,08,13
29,esto es una maravilla!,"bellissimo, quanto piacevole.
ho trascorso 3 giorni in questo bellissimo albergo! 
siamo tutti molto soddisfatti, soprattutto mia moglie
barcellona rimane la citta' piu' bella del mondo, e offre sempre ottimi alberghi ma questo e' uno dei migliori
leggermente caro, ma il resto merita 5 stelle
la mia stanza era veramente pulita e accogliente",5,2011,08,04
29,Al di là di ogni aspettativa,"Sono stata 4 giorni a Barcellona per il compleanno del mio fidanzato e per una sola (purtroppo) notte abbiamo soggiornato al Palace Hotel.
Già appena entrati nella hall ho respirato un'atmosfera di esclusività e raffinatezza.
Accoglienza perfetta, gentilezza di tutto il personale, dal facchino all'addetta alla reception.
La camera che avevo prenotato era una classic deluxe, bellissima, uno stile classico ma con qualche tocco di moderno. Punto a favore principale: letto comodissimo.
Anche il bagno era molto bello con dei prodotti veramente buonissimi dell'Occitane.
Nel pomeriggio ci hanno rifatto la camera e ci hanno lasciato un cioccolatino sul letto come omaggio. Purtroppo avevo prenotato solo la camera e non abbiamo fatto colazione, ma abbiamo usufruito del cocktail bar, ambiente davvero intimo, con luci soffuse.
Abbiamo preso un cocktail davvero ottimo (compliementi al barman, un ragazzo molto giovane, simpatico, sorridente e dai modi gentilissimi che ci ha stupiti con le suoi ""giochi di prestigio"" con bottiglie e shaker).
Che altro dire, alla partenza sono stati veramente cortesi anche nel check out.
Un hotel che purtroppo abbiamo vissuto poco (il giorno siamo stati sempre in giro), ma sicuramente se tornerò a Barcellona prenoterò tutte le notti a El Palace. Complimenti",5,2011,07,28
29,Fantastisches Hotel,"Fantastisches Hotel mit dem Charme der grand-Hotels aus den anfängen des 20. JH

Die zimmer sind nagelneu renoviert mit kamin und LCD im Spiegel
Das Bad ist wahnsinnig großzügig und sehr modern
Klaasik und Moderne sind fabelhaft auf einander abgestimmt
Super empfehlenswert und jeden Cent wert
Direkt in der Innenstadt zum flughafen ca. 30Min mit Taxi und U-Bahn",5,2011,06,24
29,Maravilloso!!!,"Este año para relajarnos y seguir conociendo España un poco mas fuimos a Barcelona mi pareja y yo; Tengo que decir que estuvimos en el mismo tiempo vacacional en tres hoteles de la provincia pero sin duda lo mejor de lo mejor fue en el Palace. Para empezar el servicio fue sin duda intachable; desde que llegamos a la entrada del Hotel que un botones nos abrio la puerta del coche, pasando por el portamaletas que nos presto un cable para que internet nos fuese aun mas rapido (nada de tiempo limitado, ni areas wifi que no van,....) Nosotros somos de economia media y bien se nos notaba con nuestras maletas del carrefour  pero no por eso recibimos un trato diferente a la gente que iba con los Rolex, mas joyas encima que una joyeria y las maletas de Sport del Pertegaz. Las habitaciones (o al menos la que nos tocó a nosotros) era preciosa; con las paredes forradas de terciopelo, una ducha de lluvia en el baño aparte dela bañera (que pienso poner en mi casa xD), vistas a plena Gran Via, Cava de bienvenida, un espejo que se convertía en Tv!! La habitación impoluta (veniamos de un hotel de 4 estrellas con unas bolas de polvo por toda la habitación, con manchas de cemento en la bañera, sin mando para la Tv y con un telefono que no funcionaba). Seguimos con El Palace....nosotros incluso hicimos un video de la habitación para la familia sentados en las sillas con el escritorio (en plan señorones con los muebles antiguos)y casi me olvidaba!!!! con chimenea debajo de la Tv/espejo; pena que con aquel calor ni la probamos. En resumen; un diez en todos los aspectos!!!!!!!!",5,2011,06,14
29,soggiorno deludente,"Hotel non all'altezza della categoria (5 stelle gran lusso) :
stanza al piano primo, con vetri opacizzati (per affaccio sulla copertura della chiostrina ),  rumorosa a causa delle frequenti vibrazioni (anche notturne) causate dal passaggio della metropolitana e della adiacenza alla stanza di servizio di piano;
pulizia poco curata (ho trovoto nel bagno un indumento intimo  lasciato dai precedenti occupanti.........);
costo della colazione esorbitante (28 euro a persona), anche in relazione al servizio ed alla qualità/varietà del cibo offerto;
assenza di collegamento internet WiFi in stanza gratuito.",3,2011,05,23
29,El Palace di nome e di fatto,"L'hotel El Palace è frutto di un'elegante e riuscita ristrutturazione dello storico hotel Ritz di Barcellona che ad oggi ha mantenuto tutto lo sfarzo e il lusso old world, sicuramente un pò pomposo, che caratterizzava l'hotel d'epoca.
Ci era stata assegnata una camera ai piani alti con splendida vista sulla piazza sottostante e di buone dimensioni con lettono comodissimo, bollitore con varie selezioni di tè, cabina armadio, ed elegante bagno (ma per quanto mi riguarda di dimensioni troppo contenute rispetto al resto della stanza) con doccia e vasca separate e prodotti l'Occitane.
La colazione è a buffet in una location di notevole bellezza con una scelta estremamente varia; ci sono addirittura specialità giapponesi, oltre salmone, vari tipi di jamon, sicuramente minore invece la varietà di pietanze dolci.
E' possibile navigare su internet gratuitamente anche se l'accesso è poco pratico in quanto prevede l'inserimento di username e password di volta in volta reperibili alla reception. Il servizio in camera e al bar è eccessivamente costoso, così come di consuetudine negli hotel 5 stelle, però di qualità: delizioso in particolare il club sandwich! La spa, appena inaugurata, è stata deludente in quanto non disponeva di una piscina, ne di un idromassaggio o bagno turco, ma solo di una piccola sauna poco invitante, ma evidentemente tali facilities non fanno parte della cultura spagnola.
Menzione di merito è da riservare alla Conserjería che è riuscita a trovarci i richiestissimi biglietti per le Final Four di Euroleague di basket e ci ha consigliato un notevole ristorante, Torre d'Alta Mar, con tanto di consistente buono omaggio, per una cena speciale. Problema reale è invece rappresentato dal rumore derivante dalla metropolita sottostante l'hotel e che noi percepivamo addirittura dal penultimo piano, anche se nel nostro caso non ha mai rappresentato un fastidio.
In conclusione hotel da consigliare per l'ottima posizione vicina alle case di Gaudì e a tutti i luoghi di maggior interesse della città, per la splendida anche se lievemente pomposa ristrutturazione, la comodità dei letti e un clima in generale estremamente lussuoso.",5,2011,05,14
29,großartiges Stadthotel,"Schönes Grand Hotel am Rande der Altstadt in einem prächtigem Haus. Sehr guter, freundlicher und zuvorkommender Service. Schöne Zimmer, bequeme Betten.",5,2011,05,04
29,Un valore aggiunto al soggiorno,"Alta qualità professionale di tutto il personale.
Hotel ristrutturato nei suoi interni secondo canoni di arredamento moderni e confortevoli.
L'arredo del bagno merita una nota a parte: vasca idromassaggio ed ampia doccia con opzione ""pioggia"", fornitura di prodotti della linea L'OCCITANE alla verbena.
Sono iscritta da alcuni anni al Club del The Leading Hotels of the World.
Abbiamo avuto un upgrade della stanza e l'omaggio della colazione servita in camera.
L' Hotel Palace ha sicuramente soddisfatto le nostre esigenze e aspettative.",5,2011,05,03
29,Che classe!,"Una grande classe, davvero! Hotel 5 stelle lusso facente parte dei ""Leading Hotels of the World"" , in posizione più che comoda per visitare la città. Bello, opulento, elegante,  lo staff gentilissimo e sorridente... Stanza ampia, curata e pulitissima (nonostante la moquette, ma era impeccabile). Come soci della catena sopra citata abbiamo (come sempre) avuto un trattamento particolarmente attento e gradevole, ma credo che in generale ci si trovi bene chiunque abbia la possibilità di essere loro ospite. La colazione in camera (non è un opzione, è la regola) è piacevolissima ed abbondante. Sicuramente da consigliare.",5,2011,05,03
29,fünf sterne luxus mit kleinen macken aber mit hervorragender gästebetreuung,"vor jahren war ich im  damaligen  ""hotel ritz "" und war gespannt auf das neue 
hotel ""el palace"". 
- der houskeeping service stolpert noch ein wenig.
- unbegreiflich ist mir - warum in dem idylische garten der eizigen fläche im freien- kein service angeboten wird oder den freiluftrauichern zur verfügung gestellt wird .   schade !
das potential des hotels (sternerestaurant, garten,öffentliche bereiche u.a.) wird leider nicht
nicht in vollem umfang zur freude der gäste  genutzt-
umso erfreulicher ist das engagement des personals der guest relations.
ganz besonders erwähnen möchte ich die feinfühlige und umsichtige beratung und betreuung durch frau katharina reschka.  meine frau und ich fanden sie als das highlight des hotels -sie fand für jeden wunsch und jedes problem eine lösung und präsentiert dies mit einer herzlichen wärme. manch kleinen ausrutscher des hotels macht sie mit ihrem wesen wieder gut.

29,Traumhaft schön,"Das ehemalige Hotel Ritz, erst vor einem Jahr renoviert, steht nur unweit der Altstadt. Die U-Bahn ist in einigen Minuten bequem zu erreichen. Durch das betreten der Eingangshalle durch die Drehtür fühlt man sich wie in eine andere Zeit versetzt. Die Umbauarbeiten haben bewusst und gekonnt das klassische Konzept hervorgehoben. Es passt alles. In der riesigen Hotellounge im Stil der 30er Jahre sitzt man im bequemen Sessel oder Sofa und bis auf die leise, sehr gut zum Hotelstil passende Hintergrundmusik herrscht eine angenehme Stille. Das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam, jedoch unaufdringlich. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig, großzügig ausgestattet, teils sogar richtig romantisch mit offenem Kamin (haben nicht gehabt), in der Dusche läßt man sich mit einer grossen Regenbrause verwöhnen. Zum Frühstück steht ein riesig großer Raum bereit, vermutlich ein Innenhof, jetzt im Winter abgeschlossen und beheizt. Eine absolute Wiederholungsgefahr.",5,2010,12,25

El servicio encantador, y la comida magnífica.
Altamente recomendable.",5,2010,12,20
29,No está a la altura,"Bastante decepcionado con este hotel,que no se encuentra a la altura de su categoría (GL). Tan solo llegar tuvimos que esperar un buen rato en la recepción a hacer el Check In porque solo había una persona tras el mostrador.
Nos acompañó un señor a la habitación quién apenas sabía hablar castellano,quién más tarde nos subió el equipaje y no se dignó ni a subir las maletas en el maletero.
El Televisor, pese a ser muy bonito, no se veía bien.
Este hotel se anuncia con Spa... es falso. Según nos dijero,está en reformas.
En los folletos turísticos tambien dice que tiene un elegante Scotch Bar. También es falso.
El WiFi en las habitaciones es de pago.

Lo unico positivo es la ubicación y la comodidad de la cama.",1,2010,12,06
29,ottimo rapporto qualita prezzo,"abituata purtroppo ai prezzi allucinanti degli alberghi di citta' come Roma, Milano, Parigi etcc.  ho apprezzato particolarmente il rapporto qualita' costo del Palace, vecchio Ritz, di Barcellona. L hotel e' un 5 stelle lusso, completamente ben ristrutturato dal gusto un po pesante(soprattutto paragonato ai nuoni boutique hotel molto minimalisti) ma comunque molto confortevole.Il personale e' gentile e abbiamo avuto un up grading, percio' per sole 230 euro tasse comprese abbiamo avuto una Junior, con la stessa cifra non so in quale squallore avrei dormito a Milano.Lo consiglio a chiunque vada a Barcellona.",5,2010,11,16
29,Excellent,"wow , der aufenthalt war einer meiner schönsten in den vergangenen jahren, das hotel ist einsame spitze, wurden auf händen getragen und alle wünsche wurden prompt erfüllt einsame spitze. die lage gleich bei der rambla war einmalig und mann kann fast alles im kurzer zeit zu fuss erreichen, leider war das gym gerade out of order was mann bei einem stäteausfug aber eigendlich gar nicht brauch weil mann eh genug kilometr abgeht ;-) ich kann diese hotel jedem empfehlen der auf prunk steht und auch gerne bereit ist mal mehr für ein hotel auszugeben, in palace hotel zahlt sich das auf jeden fall aus, wir haben allerdings das frühstück nicht in anspruch genommen den - euro p.p fanden wir dann doch zu viel.",5,2010,09,25
29,A dir poco SPLENDIDO,"Posizionato in zona centralissima a pochissimi minuti dalle principali case disegnate da Gaudì. L'hotel è lussuosissimo e il personale è di una cortesia fuori dal normale. Ci hanno offerto il noleggio gratuito di una mini per un giorno e prima del nostro arrivo ci hanno chiesto di compilare una scheda con le nostre esigenze (che tipo di stanza volevamo, cuscino morbido o duro, con terrazzo o senza terrazzo etc. etc.). La stanza, enorme, era stupenda addirittura con camino in marmo e il televisore a scomparsa in uno specchio. Il bagno modernissmo con una vasca e una doccia. Le sale comuni erano in stile liberty (meravigliose) e la sala colazione nel giardino estivo dell'hotel (molto bello).
Lo consiglio vivamente per chi adora gli hotel di lusso",5,2010,09,10
29,EL PALACE ES EL PALACE,"Realmente un hospedaje de lujo a un precio justo.
Se respira un ambiente de elegancia pero con un servicio amigable, habitaciones muy agradables y un bar lobby espectacular.

29,ottimo albergo con ambienti da film,"ottimo albergo tutte le comodità e sevizi  di un albergo alla vanguarda,  con ambienti esteticamente molto curati, aria retro, elegante, e vibrante sembra di essere nel set di un film.

29,ottima stanza,"L hotel è situato in centro a 5 minuti a piedi dalle ramblas. La stanza che ci hanno dato era ottima: molto spaziosa, arredata bene, con il caminetto. Il bagno enorme, forse uno dei piu grandi che ho visto, con ampia doccia, vasca, due lavandini e due armadi. Il tutto recentemente ristrutturato.
Unica pecca la freddezza e incompetenza del personale alla reception che al nostro arrivo non trovava la prenotazione e ci ha chiesto se avessimo sbagliato hotel...
In definitiva un buon 5 stelle.",5,2010,08,06
29,"Hotel Palace , una piacevole riscoperta","Da tanti anni vado a Barcellona per lavoro ed amo ogni volta provare una struttura diversa perchè forse fino a questo momento non ho trovato un'affinità magica , quasi completa con una struttura locale. Ero stato al Palace nel 2003 quando ancora si chiamava Ritz ed a distanza di tanti anni ci sono tornato.. Devo dire che l'hotel si presenta bene visto che è stato ristrutturato di recente e non ha perso assolutamente il suo fascino passato. La posizione è assolutamente unica , nel centro della città  e molto comoda. La camera che avevo prenotato , dotata ancora di bagno romano , era ampia e molto confortevole e con le ultime tecnologie. Meno bene invece il servizio reception abbastanza confusionario e il  servizio del ristorante ( dove ho fatto colazione ) non pari alla categoria dell'hotel . Da riprovare ?  onestamente non lo so. Questa volta ho trovato una tariffa fantastica che ha influenzato la mia scelta , la prossima volta penso proverò qualcosa di diverso..",4,2010,04,17
29,ottimo,il personale del palace hotel è molto garbato e disponibie si esprimono molto bene in italiano e inglese gente molto simpatica e affabile ti fanno sentire come se fossi a casa tua. per quanto riguarda la hall dell'hotel era di un romanticismo indescrivibile e le stanza era comoda e pulita poi i corridoi erano rivestite con dei pannelli bellissimi cosa che mia moglie a voluto fotografarli.,5,2010,01,15
