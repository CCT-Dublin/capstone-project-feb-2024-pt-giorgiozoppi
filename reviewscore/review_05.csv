05,"There were great parts, there were not-so-great parts","Pros:
-Beautiful beach area just steps away
-Lots of comfortable beach & pool chaises
-Umbrellas gallore
-Helpful lifeguards/pool attendants
-The *most* amazing beach bagno just next door with the best food we had (mere steps)
-Incredible view from the restaurant terrace
-Great breakfast - food & service
-Immaculately clean room, freshly painted
-Daily housekeeping PLUS fresh towel delivery in the evening (amazing if you showered off after the beach and then wanted to freshen for dinner as well)
-Very helpful staff - we were greeted by 6 different people and our bags taken up for us, it was a very warm welcome
-The thermal pool was well-heated and relaxing on the cooler days we were there.

Cons:
-The pool was quite literally green. In all the trip advisor photos it is very clearly the appropriate, clear, well cared for, swimming pool. It was, however, a slimy algae bath for our entire stay and the staff did not appear to care about the state of the pool at all..... incredibly bizarre. There is absolutely no point which a swimming pool should be a dark, murky green (think St. Patricks day clover green......). This is a huge con given this (with the beach) was nearly the entire reason we booked here....
-The beds are as soft as concrete. I've never slept on anything harder on my life. At several points I contemplated laying on the tile floor as it might be softer.
-The rooms are recently painted/updated, however, several aspects of the property have clearly not been cared for in some time (outdoor pool, thermal pool, indoor thermal pool, sauna, etc). They all have a film/ring around the water line, the tile inside has a film on it which insinuates you may find yourself on a slip & slide at any second, and generally the finishes are in disrepair.
-This might be a trivial note, as it's also novel and some might find it quaint, but your only access to your room is via a key that has a giant brass ball larger than any marble I've ever seen and heavy enough to weigh down my husbands pants. I understand this might be historic but for heavens sake who wants to tote around a key that could be used as a paper weight in a hurricane all day.
-We had to check out a day early due to a family emergency, and obviously fully expected to pay for the night we did not use as we pre-booked it, however, the hotel still charged us the per-person/per-night city tax for the night we did not stay, which seems very wrong.
-There is no drinking water provided in the room at any point, instead, you must pay 5 euro at the bar to get drinking water. I suppose this is relatively common in Europe, but at resorts like these we've experienced daily drinking water in our rooms much more often than not.

All that to say, we did enjoy our stay. The hotel is very convenient to the port, shopping/restaurants, and Ischia Ponte, the breakfast is great, the staff is friendly and the beach is wonderful. We would, however, stay somewere else if we came back to Ischia, due simply to the pool being un-swimmable (and also no visible attempt to rectify.... they seemed completely unbothered by the fact that the pool was violently green with algae....), and the bed being so hard you could use it as a homes foundation.",3,2024,10,04
05,My experience was not 5*,"Single room in this hotel terrible. Paint peeling on furniture, bathroom taps green with wear, round bath plaster coming off. 
Made a complaint but not followed up. Because you travel on your own should have same level of comfort as everyone else after all claims to be 5*",2,2024,08,28
05,What a wonderful holiday!,"This hotel is wonderful.  The staff are professional, but warm and friendly and will help with anything.  The hotel room was very comfortable as was the enormous bed and whilst it was very hot outside, the air conditioning ensured that our room was never too hot.  Our balcony was delightful overlooking the sea and we spent time enjoying watching the many yachts and motor launches arriving and departing.  The private beach is well supervised and catering is excellent as it is in the pool (thermal and cool water pools).  There is also an indoor thermal pool but it was not necessary to use this.  The food was outstanding from the breakfast through to the dinner with so much to choose from and the wine list was also excellent.  Such a super place to stay - we will return very soon.",5,2024,08,11
05,Beautiful hotel,This was a lovely hotel. It was so nice having easy access to the beach area with chairs and umbrellas provided. The staff were all very helpful and friendly! We had a room with a terrace and view of the water which was really nice. I would love to be back!,5,2024,08,09
05,"Ischia, la dolce vita!","Omg, what can I say?? Can’t speak highly enough of this Ischia icon, Grand hotel punta molino! From when we stepped out the ferry, promptly welcomed by the smart and smiling Ciro on the transfers, to Ciro the concierge( such a charismatic figure and so friendly!) and all the team at the reception , ladies and boys,ever smiling, helpful and knowledgeable. A mention to the GM Antonio Buono, what a gent, he’s a constant presence and reassurance to his team, at the point that the other day he was around the beach asking customers if they wanted any drinks ordered,what a humble guy, he always had a word with everybody by let you feel special,what a professional.
Not forgetting all the lifeguards on the beach from the head Franco to all the rest of the team, the staff at the breakfast and the housekeepers, all amazing. 
Can’t wait to return again soon, 6 star holiday!!!

05,Lovely Hotel,"second time staying at this lovely hotel .Absolutely nothing I can complain about from the joy of having a private beach location so easy to find your way around the area .Unfortunately my husband was taken quite poorly and if it hadn’t have been for the hotel director Antonio B who came to the  with hospital  just don’t know how we would have managed without him because of the language barrier .His team were so kind and caring , and would come back again and again .Though recommend a room with balcony and terrace .",5,2024,07,14
05,Best hotel experience I can remember,"The stay started with a text from the hotel telling me that they will be at the dock to pick up my family and I. 
As promised two cars were waiting with very friendly and professional drivers. 
Check in was quick and informative.   The staff instead to carried all our luggage to the rooms. 
The rooms are very well appointed bright and clean.  I felt like the staff straighten the room every time we stepped out.
We had a wonderful meal at the restaurant.   Don't miss the food.
The pool and beach are great.   Again the staff was everywhere with towels helping with umbrellas and chairs.  Very friendly. 
We had such a great time we added another day to our trip.  Even though it cost us unreadable train ferry and hotel in Roma. We are going to plan a couple weeks there soon.",5,2024,06,26
05,A marvellous holiday.,"An outstanding hotel - we stayed a week and it was both luxurious and friendly. Attentive staff, totally professional, helped guests with everything to enjoy their stay, and did so with a smile. Breakfast overlooking the bay of Naples, stunning views, and a menu to delight the senses. Local wine totally gorgeous. Spa & swimming pools, gym, sauna, beauty & health treatments, all of excellent quality. Room seriously comfortable and serviced to pristine standards. 
The hotel grounds are a delight - beautiful layed-out gardens and a short walk to Ischia’s main shopping & restaurant areas. 
A wonderful experience, we felt we had been treated like royalty. Thoroughly deserves its 5 star rating & exceeded our expectations!
A very happy holiday!",5,2024,06,02
05,magical spot on the island of Ischia,"This resort is a magical spot on the island of Ischia.
A charming hotel, renovated rooms, lush vegetation around, gives a feeling as if you are in the Seychelles, and especially the thermal, outdoor and indoor pools that are the real surprise that the place inspires. Yes, of course, there is also a large outdoor pool, and access to a private beach.
The hotel overlooks the Castello Aragonese, surrounded by beach restaurants (some of which were still closed in May) and within walking distance of Ischia's main street.
Great breakfasts, live music on the weekends, and efficient staff.
The shuttle service from and to the port definitely adds to the feeling of excellent hospitality.
Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,30
05,Tiny Room,"Certainly the location,beach,staff and breakfast are really lovely. However my single room does not rate 5*. The chipped furniture and old fashioned bathroom need updating. My room does not match the pictures advertised.
No tea,coffee facilities. TV did not have any foreign channels which all hotels in Italy I’d stayed in",3,2024,05,26
05,Thank you for a lovely honeymoon!,"Punta Molino! Thank you for everything! After much searching among Ischia's wide range of hotels, we finally found Punta Molino Spa and Resort, and we are SO happy about it! We spent a week of our honeymoon at this wonderful hotel. Everything was just perfect - the charming rooms, the friendly, welcoming reception staff, the delicious breakfast with the kind service staff, the warm thermal pools, the comfortable sunbeds and the security with lifeguards... Yes, the list could go on, but especially we want to thank the staff who saw us, took care of us, and always had a smile on their faces. Impressive! You are so kind. Thanks also to the down-to-earth director who paid attention to us guests, always professional, accommodating, and polite. Thank you also for the lovely evening music and our song; O Sole Mio! What a memory! We will definitely come back and look forward to creating more loving memories at Punta Molino! Now we continue our honeymoon towards Rome and then back home to Sweden again! 
Thank you for everything, greetings from Pernilla and Pär!",5,2024,05,13
05,"Great Horel, Great Service","Lovely hotel with great service and excellent breakfast. From the moment that we got picked up at the ferryport by the hotel staff until we left we felt most welcomed and treated like royals. Especially Ciro went more then an extra mile to make our stay unforgettable. 

I am already looking forward to going back!",5,2024,02,08
05,3 - 4 Star Not a 5 Star as Is Advertised,"Situated in a Good locations which is a plus 
Hoping this helps both customers and the hotel 
Hotel could really use some updates and upgrades 
Really Confused on how this is a 5 Star Hotel as it is more like a 3 -4 star hotel in regards to service 
Service is mediocre at best and you must request service or any attention from staff on the grounds to receive help or customer service. 

I reserved one of there top tier suites, water will only get warm and won’t get hot enough to fill the jacuzzi tub , which I understand things do happen. 
The service and fit and finish is definitely NOT what is expected from a 5 Star Rated Hotel 
Best customer service by Far comes from Ciro at the front desk who is very pleasant and has great customer service skills 

I would highly recommend the staff receives customer service training and expectations to ensure a Great customer experience and to keep the customers coming back 

Hope this helps them to increase there customer service for the company and more importantly for the customers to want to come back",3,2023,09,16
05,"Nice hotel, but too quick to charge for ‘extras’","A return to this Ischia hotel after 18 years. It has changed in some ways - less atmospheric perhaps and a tad less friendly - but it retains the wonderful location, the sea vistas from the terrace where meals are served alongside a summer bar with a nightly piano singer and the well appointed rooms. Our sea facing balcony was nicely shaded during the very hot afternoons so well worth the upgrade. Room was comfortable with walk in shower. We were given a nice complimentary Prosecco bottle and fruit on arrival, but water is not free in the room (€5 a bottle) which doesn’t feel right in a 5* hotel; nor does the woefully intermittent Wi-Fi reception. The spa was good, with excellent massages. Breakfasts were decent buffets, but again a tad surprisingly, omelettes attract a €15 surcharge. We had a nice dinner on the terrace our first night, but enjoyed some of the excellent local restaurants other nights. Overall a nice hotel, but it could benefit from a more generous attitude to its guests in the small things.",4,2023,08,03
05,Everything is there to make you feel  like Italian royalty,"The Italians that run this hotel really know to do it,…of course the linens on the bed were soft, pressed  and comfortable, the rooms were big and spacious, and the food was spectacular, and then combining this with an outstanding spa treatment, you’ll feel like royalty …..it’s the total package not to forget to mention  the thermal pool and the private beach right there. The location is wonderful and it’s walking distance to the shops…..if you want a fantastic all around resort to stay …stay at Punto Molina in Ischia and feel like Royalty. ",5,2023,07,28
05,Luxury at it’s finest on the beautiful island of Ischia,"I came to this quant jem on the recommendation of my dear friend Salvatore. It is just stunning, my room overlooks the water and the nearby castle. The hotel is directly on a beautiful beach and has a thermal pool. I’m sitting here in the restaurant sipping on a Bellini and enjoying the freshest fish. The staff is very attentive and the service is impeccable. I will be recommending this resort to all of my friends and family . ",5,2023,07,22
05,"Superb hotel, so safe and great location ","Loved this place. Staff so nice, location great,  comfy sunbeds and all beautiful.  

Drink prices higher but you pay for the surroundings!

The sea was so warm, beautiful.  Every member of staff so helpful.

Thank you for a lovely stay and your kindness ",5,2023,07,18
05,Gorgeous location and good hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in late June/early July and enjoyed it very. much. The location is spectacular, with a lovely small private beach, beautiful views, great swimming pools, and convenient to walk to the port and the castle, with nice shops and good restaurants close by. Many of the staff were very nice too, including the head waiter.
There were a couple of relatively small things that made our stay good rather than great. The beds were hard and uncomfortable and so were the pillows. On Day 5 of 7, we asked if they could help with this and they gave us mattress toppers and better pillows, which made things a bit better. There was a flashing light on the ceiling (smoke alarm?) which was quite obtrusive and annoying and interrupted sleep. And no matter how early we went down to the beach, the front row of beach chairs were reserved with towels etc. I asked the lifeguard and he said they reserved them for clients. So I'm not sure what is going on there?
On the positive side again, the breakfast buffet was fabulous and delicious, with a good range of appealing options. The restaurant had a lovely view, and we enjoyed eating there, though it was a bit expensive and the vegetarian options were very limited.
Some of the staff were friendlier than others.
All of that said, we enjoyed the traditional atmosphere of the hotel, as well as the location, and would recommend it.",4,2023,07,12
05,Lots is very good,"Brilliant location. 
Many staff were very friendly and lovely. 
Superb breakfasts although the fresh fruit choice was limited and the overall breakfast selection didn’t alter during our stay. Great scrambled eggs and the best smoked salmon I’ve had in many years. 
Fantastic pools. 
Limited inside bar drink selection. 
Lots of comfy areas to sit in the hotel. 
Unfortunately the very worst packed breakfast on our early checkout day. 2 very dry rolls with a thin filling, bottle of water, some fruit and 2 slices of factory packed toast. No yoghurt, fruit juice or fresh pastries as our previous, lower starred hotel had provided. ",4,2023,05,21
05,"A bit tired, but good location","Definitely a mixed bag here! We stayed for 6 nights in September.

We really liked the outdoor pool - it's deep and refreshing, but really cold, which we personally like, but too cold for other people, I think, given the lack of anyone else in it.

Beach was great (sea was much warmer than the pool), and the outdoor thermal pool was lovely.

However, the staff were a little stand-offish, which didn't really bother us though we were conscious of it, and some information on check in would have been nice - just basics like breakfast times, or pointing us to facilities. Literally got given an key and off we went. 

Room was fine, and loved the sea view with castle in the distance, but be aware that if you're anywhere near the pool/restaurant area, you will hear the hotel singer and piano player every night from 9pm to midnight, even with the windows shut. Fair enough if you like a hotel with entertainment - but if you don't, be warned and take some ear plugs! Or give in and sing along. It all felt a bit dated, honestly.

The indoor spa area was pretty grim - the sauna and steam room were switched off when we were there, but I did have a look at the smell of mould was pretty overwhelming. Certainly not the spa experience we've had in Italy before. And I never saw anyone having any treatments - it was a bit of a ghost town in there.  I wouldn't have had a treatment there.

For the price, we wanted more, but still had a lovely time jumping from sea to pool, and location is great. 

Would I recommend it? If you can get a very good deal, and want a decent base with a beach, then yes. If you are after the 5 star spa experience it promises, then no - try elsewhere.",3,2022,10,30
05,Highly recommended!,Lovely hotel with a perfect setting.  Our junior suite was well laid out and very spacious. Breakfast was wonderful.  The attention and recommendations from the front desk were excellent.  Always friendly and eager to assist you.  Really loved the various beach areas to relax. Highly recommend.,5,2022,09,18
05,Really Disappointed,"We returned to stay at Punto Molino having stayed here in 2019.  Wow what a difference, it has lost it's charm and appeal.  The service at Breakfast and Dinner in the Restaurant was poor.  The choice of food in the evening just wasn't good enough.  It's such a pity because this hotel has the best view of the Castle.",2,2022,08,26
05,Wonderful Stay,"We had a beautiful room with a balcony  with good AC and comfortable beds.  The room was big  enough with good space to store your belongings.  The hotel is on the sea, so it’s a short walk to sit in a lounge chair and gaze at the nearby castle.  There is a big outdoor pool and a smaller thermal one.  The people who work there are  attentive and kind.  The gym isn’t much though. And dinner, while ok,was our worst meal in Ischia and the most expensive.",5,2022,07,25
05,Lovely hotel,"Had a lovely time in Ischia and at this hotel. Rooms spotlessly clean, excellent food and service at breakfast and dinner. Pretty grounds and nice pool and beach areas. Only negatives for us and hence not a 5 were awful internet and pools need a good clean as green algae on the sides. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,07,20
05,Sensational hotel,"Sensational hotel! I don’t know what more to say. Excellent service, food, accommodation and position. Private beach, pool and thermal bath was great. I highly recommend that couples or families looking for great value for money stay here.",5,2022,07,10
05,5 Star!,"We arrived early before our room was ready. We were shown to the bar and given a complimentary drink and a room to store our bags so we could change and enjoy the amenities. We had originally booked a sea view room but had had to change our booking due to travel restrictions and only a garden view was available. We weren’t disappointed, it was lovely. The only issue we had was the mattresses were hard but when I asked for a mattress topper the hotel obliged ( it actually didn’t make that much difference but they did try to help) The location is perfect, very peaceful but within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The staff were exceptional as was the food. Rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels delivered if needed, even in the evening, with a turn down service. My only negative point would be that the drinks were very expensive, but you  do have choice, just buy your own and sit on the balcony. We will definitely return to this hotel, and would like to thank Luigi and Salvatore for their exceptional service at breakfast and dinner, as well as the rest of the staff. Thank you for making our delayed honeymoon so special. Joanne & Mark",5,2022,07,05
05,Perfecto!,"Punta Molino is one of the most wonderful hotels I’ve stayed in!  A complete throwback to the days of grandeur-in the best way possible.  I am very picky about hotels (I love Four Seasons…)-Punta Molino is beautifully done-Superior Old Style Sea view room is gorgeous (nicer than website pics), immaculate, beautiful bathroom, all amenities (body wash, shower caps, etc) great view and balcony-yes, over a roof, which could bother me but view was so amazing it did not detract!  New Style Superior room also looked beautiful.  This is not your typical American hotel (good!)- it is truly an Italian beach resort where you can feel the history of the gorgeous island.  Now, onto the amazing: 1. Shuttle driver, Ciro! We hugged and kissed goodbye.   He was incredible, took such great care of us from pick up to drop off at the ferry  2. Andrea at front desk-so wonderful and accommodating in every way! (our ferry to Sorrento was cancelled 2 days in a row-he moved things around so we could stay, and generally met our every need-we love Andrea!). 3. Ciro the concierge, moved mountains for us to get from Ischia to Sorrento.   Pretty much, every request and need is met with a smile and everyone works hard to
make your stay perfect.   Oh, finally, the hotel beaches (there are several!) and thermal pools are amazing! Views of the castle, easy to swim, lounge, heal in the thermal pool.  As I said, our stay was literally perfecto!   I understand some of the less glowing reviews-(again, it’s not a Four Seasons) but I absolutely loved this beautiful, warm, welcoming hotel.   Run, don’t walk!  I hope to return very soon with my family and friends.",5,2022,06,10
05,Could Be Better,Hotel staff is wonderful and grounds are beautiful. Convenient location to walk to restaurant and shopping. Breakfast in the morning is good. Unfortunately at midnight they turn off the AC which made it uncomfortable in the heat. Our phone also did not work so we had to walk down to reception for our needs.,3,2022,05,26
05,A true Italian Gem!,"We stayed for 2 nights and wish we stayed another 2 nights! This is truly a grand hotel in every way. Old Italian luxury that is hard to find! Our room and bathroom were large and spacious and beautifully appointed. We had a large balcony overlooking the sea. Our room was immaculate. The staff was very helpful and friendly and have decorum as one would expect at a hotel of this stature. This hotel has two mineral pools to promote health and wellness, and I have to say they really were amazing. The hotel is right on the beach, and has a lovely private beach area. The breakfast is fantastic, and their restaurant is superb!  The location is fantastic as you can walk to the castle, and it is also quiet and out of the hubbub of the busy areas. We can’t wait to return. Don’t pass up this fantastic resort.",5,2021,10,11
05,Old Fashioned Italian Gem,"We’ve just stayed at this quaint and charming hotel for the past 6 days. The rooms are clean, well equipped and comfortable. Ours had a sea view and looked down on  both pools, including the Thermal pool which was lovely. The staff are very friendly,  attentive and provide good old fashioned service which was a real treat. There is a Spa, beach, indoor pool, bar and restaurant suitable for perhaps those looking for some peace and quiet in a traditional setting - more adult than young children friendly and a great place to stay! 
Thank you again Warren & Amanda - we hope to be back",5,2020,09,26
05,Lovely hotel but...,"I'm left with mixed feelings about Punta Molina as it has a five star rating and was not what I expected.  The hotel and grounds are lovely, spa pools inside and out fabulous, great, fairly extensive private beaches that were never overly busy at the end of September, very nice breakfast.  The reception staff were unfailingly helpful with requests for advice.  Good location with nice restaurants in 15 minute walk - on our first morning we asked to see the restaurant menu but were told we needed to wait for the restaurant manager to arrive so didn't bother.  Less postive was the (small) shower that was either hot or cold, near impossible to maintain a reasonable temperature; cheap, plywood type of sliding door from the bathroom to the bedroom; and wifi was completely dire. Not trying to use any great bandwidth, just emails, reading newspapers on line etc.  Constantly dropped out or froze. Our partial sea view room had a lovely sideways view to the castle and sea but in the foreground was lots of tiled flat roof and directly opposite was a bank of rooms and balconies. Nice facilities but not a five star hotel.",4,2019,11,12
05,Outstanding,"Loved this hotel.... It's services.. Food etc.. But the view is priceless and ischia is out favorite place! A must place to stay and enjoy the night music over the ocean!
Our room was spectacular... Clean.. Turn down service was so elegant. The staff could not have done more and the water was crystal clear! ",5,2019,09,26
05,Late Summer Break,"A place of calm and efficient service set in private grounds around the small beach with easy walking access to the shops, bars, Port and to San Pietro.

A really very nice place to relax, enjoy the facilities food and stay.

All the staff very courteous and helpful especially Ciro on Front Desk,Giorgio behind the bar and Ciro the taxi driver.",4,2019,09,25
05,Searching for genuine humanity? This is the right place ,"I’d just heard about Punta Molino Resort ever since, but finally had the chance to stay there for three days, and I can honestly say that it was a great experience. The location is gorgeous and allows you to reach the main venues in Ischia Porto. The view from every part of the resort is stunning as well as the park that surrounds it. Customers can choose several services such as the gym, the thermal baths, the beaches, the spa, and, of course, the bar and an elegant but not formal restaurant. Everything is so easy that you don’t need any induction to enjoy these services. But what, in my opinion, makes this resort really special and attracts and retains customers is the staff, from the manager to the waiters. I happened to meet people who have been spending their summer holidays for 26 years in a row at Punta Molino Resort, and the main reason of their fidelity is the sincere kindness and humanity of all the people working there, from the eldest to the recent ones. And as a brand new customer, I can confirm this without any doubt.",5,2019,08,22
05,Ischia Spas and fun!,"The Punta Molina hotel was lovely, turning back the clock to a glamorous old Hollywood era. It is hard to find people who speak English but the hotel always had a staff member to provide services and help including hiring a car for us. We ventured to Maronti Beach and climbed to a spa Cavascura. We also spent time in the thermal pool and pool and beach right at our hotel with a stunning view of the Castle. There is not much nightlife but they did have a piano terrace bar. We used the hotel spa for a facial and it was lovely.",4,2019,08,05
05,Lovely hotel ,"I think this is this is the best hotel in Ischia. The staff at reception were superb, especially Eleanor and Ceco were so helpful  and couldn’t do enough to help. The hotel was very well run from the service at the beach & pontoons to the restaurant, and you can tell the management know how to look after their guests . Hotel is well worth visiting and will definitely be back. ",5,2019,07,15
05,Classy Place,The location was excellent -situated at the waterfront with spacious gardens. Also it was within walking distance to the castle and the port.  It is not an ultra modern hotel but has lots of character. The bed was very comfortable with good quality bedding and fluffy towels. The food was delicious. We were there 2nd to 9th June and the night before we left dinner moved from the dining room to the patio area. We didn’t have any problem getting a lounger at the beach or the pool and the thermal pool was amazing. This holiday was organised by Citalia and they were first class. No complaints about any aspect of this hotel.,5,2019,07,13
05,Swimwear,"Excellent hotel all round food very good
But.    We used the out door thermal pool and it completely ruined two pairs of my husbands swimwear and one of my bikinis
There are no signs to warn against this
We were not the only ones who had this problem other guests also had same problem
Has any one else who stayed at this hotel found this
Hotel not helpfull with complaint",5,2019,07,10
05,A gem of a hotel really,"Stayed here recently for five days and would thoroughly recommend. 
Good rooms , nice staff ,excellent breakfasts and a great private beach all add to make this a special memory for us. 
Location was superb too. Close enough to walk to either the point or port in minutes but also seemed far from the crowds given its “hidden “ location. 
Didn’t use the pool because the sea was far too attractive however it too looked excellent. 

All in all unassuming non glitzy just what we needed. 

We would definitely return.",4,2019,06,30
05,A Wonderful experience.,"The location of this hotel is amazing , on the beach and close to shops and restaurants, but above all,  the staff are so attentive and helpful with everything.
My second visit and I certainly hope to be back again next year.",5,2019,06,26
05,Great stay at Punta Molina Resort,"Excellent accommodation and service. Only negative is breakfast is really poor. The private beach whilst easy access has a really rough stone sand and is uncomfortable for walking.
Both Thermal pool and swimming pool are spotless. 
Excellent location for town center and restaurants.",4,2019,06,25
05,Absolutely beautiful!,"Just returned from six nights at this beautiful hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise! As it was our wedding anniversary it felt very special. Service from the reception staff, cleaning staff, pool staff and restaurant staff was superb. A special mention to Salvatore, restaurant manager who was so professional and very funny!!

The spa treatments we had were excellent (massage and facial).

The indoor and outdoor thermal pools are lovely and we had a relaxing experience especially as the weather was not great.

This hotel is in a superb location within walking distance to local shops and bars and to the amazing castle.

Highly recommended. Thank you!",5,2019,05,31
05,Ivanov ,"Recommended hot. Evreting here is amazing. The staff are very welcome friendly. Pools is lovely, food on the snacks bar is very delicious.

I really anjoed and I will be back ",5,2019,05,18
05,Illusion of grandeur,"This is clearly one of those places where you either have to be lucky or Italian. 
I booked this hotel very well in advance, in fact as soon as this year’s booking became available, hoping to secure good accommodation. 
We were allocated two smallish rooms on the top floor, south-facing and very uncomfortably hot as the air-conditioning was still switched on to heating. The reception explained that there is a law which does not allow to switch on the cooling before June! It really does not make sense to me as the heating would be as environmentally unsound. 
We had to keep our windows open throughout our stay and did not have a decent night sleep. There was noise and tobacco smoking from outside. The bedding, of the cheap variety, was quite telling as I had to deconstruct the covers to remove the inside blanket to make it less hot. Imagine my surprise when I found there were two blankets arranged lengthwise instead of a single one of a right size. 
The bathroom fittings were outdated and not very efficient. The bath drain and its plug were rusty. The shower was of a cheap nasty plastic type you can buy in a supermarket for a fiver, and the temperature of the shower was almost impossible to control. It was going from cold to boiling hot with a sudden surge. 
These things might appear insignificant, but they add up to create a bad impression. There must be better rooms here, considering all the good reviews, but we were not lucky enough to stay in those. 
After we left, we looked at the bill and saw that we were entitled to spa treatments! No one at the reception mentioned it, or indeed pointed the spa out to us. 
This is not a five-star hotel. 
Very disappointed.",1,2019,04,23
05,Will be back,"I came here for work and will definitely bring my family back. Was a lovely hotel in a beautiful place on a wonderful island.

We hired scooters and toured the island which was a great way to get around and see the beaches, thermal waters, amazing restaurants and picturesque towns.",5,2019,01,15
05,5 stars and deserves each one,"We arrived early and I made the reservation for the following day. They kindly switched the day and offered us a drink on gorgeous patio overlooking water for our inconvenience. Location is perfect, 20 minute walk from the ferry and 20 minutes further to the Castello. Right on ocean with multiple small beaches and a warm salt pool and regular swimming pool. Our room was a garden view yet you could see the water and castle. AC worked great. Finally, breakfast was fantastic with full buffet including such touches as peeled Kiwi and soft boiled eggs separated according to 3, 4 or 5 minutes cooked. ",5,2018,09,10
05,Tranquil Vacation in June,"My wife and I originally booked for one week in June.  After a few days of this relaxing and tranquil environment, as well as the service by everyone, we extended for an extra week. Management and staff were absolutely keen on making the guests comfortable to the utmost. Our room (in the main hotel) was spacious, had a nice balcony with a sea and castle view which was especially beautiful when lit at nights.  We enjoyed the friendly and efficient service at the Terrazza Dining where we had breakfast and dined at nights with the piano bar lasting until mid-night. Pool and beach attendants ensured our comfort by providing necessary items for lounging. The resort has a large outdoor pool, two thermal pools, a sauna, Turkish sauna, a gym and also a spa. We enjoyed the thermal indoor pool on days when it rained.  Sitting in the gardens with all the flowers in bloom, gazing at the sky added to the ambience at nights. The hotel is in an ideal location, half-way between Ischia Ponte and the Castle Argonnese. Our two-week vacation at this lovely resort was a fantastic experience and we plan to return very soon! Thanks to all at Punta Molino Resort and Spa for a wonderful vacation in Ischia.",5,2018,07,06
05,"Great location, great staff but terrible air conditioning","Just returned from 9 nights in this hotel in a Superior sea view with balcony room. The room was spacious and clean with views over the roof of the restaurant towards the sea. On arrival they kindly gave us a bottle of sparkling wine and a plate of fruit which is a lovely touch. So thank you for that. There was sufficient wardrobe space, although we did request more hangers and a further 9 hangers arrived promptly.
Happily for me there was a plug for my hairdryer within reach of a mirror (which a common bugbear for me).
My biggest complaint on the room was the air con. The weather was seldom higher than 26 degrees when we were there but the air com was completely inadequate. The room was so hot we didn't get a decent nights sleep for the entire time we were there. We complained to the management and they mumbled something about changing rooms but we didn't want to have to pack and unpack all our things so we asked them to fix it. They said they would but there was little improvement so we just put up with it. We opened the windows most nights and the mosquitos weren't too bad as the weather was not that hot. I dread to think what it would be like in August.
Moving on to other areas; the beach area was great and we had a tremendous service from the beach staff. They saved us two beds every morning on a raised platform overlooking the castle. It was exceptional service, we didn't even have to ask them, they knew we liked that spot and saved it for us every day. They also worked tirelessly to keep us in the shade or out in sun, what ever we wanted. Full marks to them.
We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was varied and pretty good. Although the egg chef only appeared once in 9 days. There was a good choice of sweet and savoury including smoked salmon and typical cheeses and meats.
The position of the hotel is great, it is almost immediately on the beach, with just a path to cross to reach it. It is about equal distance (roughly 1K ) from both the port and the castle.
Overall this is a very nice clean hotel but I would say it is 4 stars, not five. There were a few little gripes like not leaving fresh shower gel in room (presumably to save money).
The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, they bought our return tickets for the ferry and added them to bill which was very efficient.",4,2018,07,02
05,lovely hotel,"I can't understand the negative reviews on this hotel. we have just returned from a weeks stay here and found it very clean and charming. I would class this a quiet, elegant hotel. The food was fabulous and the staff couldn't do enough for us, but be aware that Ischia is wear the Italians holiday so English is not widely spoken, therefor only a couple of the staff spoke good english  the rest were passable and sometimes confusing. We had a very pleasent stay.",5,2018,06,23
05,Degrading splendour,"We've been to this hotel two times already and I believe, there will not be a third time.  It is sad to see how the personnel and the quality of service are degrading.  Especially, the restaurant: when all the local shops were full of local fruit, the restaurant offered us canned pears.  Almost no seafood... at a seaside restaurant!  All in all, what might be passable for a 3-star place, appears totally inappropriate for a 5-star Grand hotel that used to boast incomparable service.

Not a disaster, or course, but a complete waste in terms of money vs. quality.",3,2017,12,12
05,Fantastic Experience.  Would definitely go back to.,"This is an all around really great hotel that is really focused on customer service.  The location is great, half way between the port and the castle/monastery that's definitely worth checking out for it's amazing views.  The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the port but on a nice day you can walk either distance and check out the many restaurants in either location.  All front desk staff speak fluent English and are very friendly and helpful in helping you figure out what to do during your stay whether at the hotel, on the island, or if you want to take a trip nearby.  The remaining hotel staff speak at least some basic English so we definitely felt comfortable getting our needs met. The complimentary breakfast was very good with a lot of variety including eggs, salmon, great local cheeses, and delicious pastries, etc.  You can grab a glass of champagne daily with breakfast, but get there on the earlier side because occasionally it doesn't last the entire service.  The wait staff will also bring you coffee or cappuccino to the table.  We were traveling off season so we got upgraded free of charge to a room with a view of the sea and the castle which was a really nice view to wake up to.  The rooms were very clean, great size and very comfortable.  The staff cleaned them multiple times a day and changed our towels.  The complementary toiletries smelled nice but If you have long hair, I recommend bringing conditioner because the shampoo doesn't seem to be a shampoo/conditioner mixture.  The hotel has great outdoor services with a private beach, pool, as well as a thermal pool.  There is always an attendant on duty who hands out towels and helps you get settled.  We decided to chill at the hotel on two different days and found it to be very relaxing and refreshing.  Overall, the stay felt very smooth and easy and we came back home very relaxed.  I definitely want to go back to Ischia because it's a truly amazing island to visit and I would definitely try to stay at this hotel again.  Highly recommended!",5,2017,10,03
05,"Elegant in a previous era, now just tired ","Punta Molino is like your relative who smoked too many cigarettes in the 70s. Perhaps perceived as elegant at the time, but has aged very poorly. 

The rooms are dated, the service is well intentioned but inconsistent, and the facilities have not been maintained to a level you'd expect from a 5 star hotel (rusty tiles around the pool, very shabby indoor pool facilities surrounded by fake plants and flowers). 

While Ischia is lovely, do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. ",2,2017,09,09
05,Old World Italian Charm,We stayed at the Grand Hotel Punta Molino for a week in July . We were made to feel instantly welcome from the moment we arrived . Staff fantastically helpful from reception to life-guards on the beach . Will definitely return. Thanks to everyone who made our stay on Ischia so memorable !,5,2017,08,09
05,Fantastic in every way!,"Stayed here for three nights. The hotel is stunning. The grounds are beautiful, quiet and serene. The room fantastic (thanks for the upgrade to a suite!). The staff was wonderful so helpful in every way. The views are beautiful. You have a choice of pools or beach and a short stroll to town and great restaurants. Fabulous outdoor breakfast. Would highly recommend this jewel and am sorry we couldn't stay longer!",5,2017,08,04
05,Nice Hotel,"The room was spotless and comfortable and we had 2 adults and a 14 year old boy. The location was nice, close to town. The grounds were a bit tired. Staff was wonderful and pleasant. Breakfast was great and a fantastic view. WiFi could use some help.",3,2017,07,21
05,Disappointing- Not recommended,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband for 4 nights. Upon check-in there is no orientation/explanation of the hotel features (pool, breakfast hours, wifi etc) which is pretty standard in any hotel. The wifi only worked in the lobby-- not our room, breakfast area, or pool. The hotel itself is dated. I believe this hotel caters to Italians 55yrs old and older. There was poor service at the pool-- we had to spend 15 minutes each morning finding someone to give us a towel. I booked through the hotel's website which offers ""free beach/pool towels only booking on this website""-- Yet, towels were free for everyone. One night, I killed a large roach in our room. Spend your money elsewhere. ",1,2017,07,18
05,VERY GOOD HOTEL. CONVENIENT LOCATION. BEAUTIFUL SERVICE,"VERY GOOD HOTEL. CONVENIENT LOCATION. BEAUTIFUL SERVICE. The staff was wonderfully attentive, not imposing.
A buffet breakfast was served on the terrace and offered all possible variety of products. All products are fresh and delicious and the restaurant service is superb.The room was amazing with a nice balcony and a beautiful view.
The hotel overlooks its own private beach with ample chaise longue, overlooking the neighboring island of Procida and the impressive Castle of Castello Aragones. In the evening, at the piano bar, we had the opportunity to listen to very talented musicians and got a real pleasure from their singing.
In general, the atmosphere was relaxed everywhere, and all the staff were immaculately presented and friendly. We always had help from employees on any questions and advice. Thanks to all the hotel's STAFF for their attention to us. Thanks to them, we had one of the best vacation and we will definitely return to our next summer.
The best recommendations for all.",5,2017,07,08
05,Great Location!,This property was a pleasant surprise. The view was wonderful and the room was of a high standard. Easy walk to the local restaurants whether you are looking for a pizza or a 4 course meal. The staff was very attentive and accomodating.,5,2017,05,19
05,LUXURY RELAXATION,"My wife and I arrived at the Grand Punta Molino Hotel in Ischia to be greeted with the news we were being upgraded to a Superior Room.
Having booked for 14 nights, we were shown to the most beautiful room imaginable with a sea view you dream of.
Staff were wonderfully attentive without being intrusive.
Buffet breakfast was served on the terrace (one of our highlights) and offered everything... cereals; yoghurts; fruit juice; bacon; eggs (scrambled/poached/sunny side up); sausages; cold meats; cheeses; croissants; pastries; gateaux; tea/coffee... and even spumante in a flute glass (no extra charge) if the notion takes you.
The exotic Piano Bar featured a female singer and highly talented pianist each evening. Songs were Italian and old time American favourites.
In addition to the outdoor pool was a smaller adjacent heated pool.
The hotel looked out onto it's own private beach with adequate sunbeds offering views of the neighbouring island of Procida and the spectacular Castello Aragonese.
Every beauty treatment imaginable was available in the sauna and spa area.
Overall, the atmosphere was relaxed throughout and all staff were immaculately presented and friendly.
We were made to feel like VIPs.
I would recommend the Punta Molino to anyone... in fact, everyone!",5,2016,10,19
05,Always a winner!!!!,"This was the 3rd time at this hotel and never left disappointed.
On arrival the room was amazing with a nice terrace and a really relaxing bath tab. The breakfast and dinner were very good and the staff super professional. I would particularly mention a young italian guy ( sorry can't remember his name) he served us at breakfast and dinner and remember that I have a dairy allergy...We will return for sure.",5,2016,10,09
05,Mr,"The only reason I am writing this review is that we E mailed our concerns to the hotel on returning to the UK and thought that someone  might of replied. This was our 5th time here and I have to say that we were left disappointed this time. On a positive note all the staff are very friendly and helpful. In particular the beach attendants were brilliant. The room we stayed in was very tired. The shower screen is old very stained and water leaked badly onto the floor. We were left a towel with a six inch hole in! Generally though the room was clean. The most disappointing area was the restaurant where the standard of the evening food has gone down hill since our last visit. The 'show night' food which we have always looked forward to was quite frankly awful. The suckling pig was inedible. The chefs serving the food were casually dressed- no chefs uniforms. No pomp and ceremony as previous years. No sense of a special occasion. In fact whilst we were there another British couple walked out without completing their meal. The choice of wine was limited. We wanted a rose of which there was one choice. We tried it and found it so bad returned it. We overheard other clients (at least three ) ordering various wines only to be told they were not available. Even though we feel the standard has slipped we will return next year to see if there has been an improvement. We sincerely hope so because it is a beautiful hotel in a wonderful location.

05,"Fabulous location, disappointed with the hotel ","Amazing location between Ischia Porto and Ischia Ponte with a stunning little beach and super beach staff. Very disappointed with the 'luxury 5 star' aspect. Wi-FI almost non existent in our room (we'd paid top supplement for sea view - stunning), sadly a tiny balcony which obscured everything except an immediate view. Advertised English TV channels (I know it sounds sad but we like to chill out & watch a film early evening before going out for supper) only two channels CNN & BBC news which were on a repeated cycle. Mini bar didn't get topped up during our stay, turn down service appeared twice at 5.30 while we were showering and so never came back. One night they did turn down the bed but left the door wide open...Most disappointing after being told we could use a room to shower & change before heading home (we were quite happy to have paid a supplement for late check out as our flight was at 9pm). We were shown a cramped changing room amongst the spa area & told to use the communal shower. No mirror, no plug for a hair dryer. After showering we went to reception and I asked to use the room where our bags were stored so I could use a plug, reception were very helpful but housekeeping weren't pleased! £1500+ for 6 nights b & b.... I expect and have relieved better! Won't be returning to this hotel but will try others nearby as we love Ischia. ",3,2016,10,01
05,"Punta Molino - Amazing service, food, and location!","This was the first stop for our honeymoon across Italy.  And by far, this was one of our favorite stays.  The hotel staff is accommodating and very helpful with traveling questions, and restaurant recommendations. Staff was even helpful in coordinating ferry trips for us and helping us get to where we needed to be.  We were so happy with how easy they made it for us to get around.  The hotel is also in a great location - less than a 5 minute walk to the shopping / restaurant district and a close 15 min walk to the castle.  Overall, I cant say enough about the quality of the hotel, the staff, and location.  And to seal the deal, the hotel breakfast was by far the best one of the three different hotels we stayed in Italy.",5,2016,09,22
05,Believe the fabulous reviews! ,"This place is wonderful and all the really positive comments about it are true! We flew to Naples and then   Citalia, our tour operator, transferred us by taxi to the port where we went by hydrofoil to Ischia port and then were transferred by taxi to the hotel. It might sound a bit of a rigmarole but was actually very straightforward. 

We received a very warm welcome from Ciro at Reception and were told that we had been upgraded. I'm not sure what we had done to deserve this, we certainly didn't ask for an upgrade but we were really delighted to be given a Junior Suite. The best thing about the suite was the extra large balcony which meant we had a 180 degree  view of the sea, including the spectacular Aragonese castle. To be honest though, providing you have a view of the sea, I should imagine that  all the rooms are lovely. 

Some of the comments here aren't overly positive about the food of an evening. I've no idea why. It, and the restaurant service are superb. You can choose what you wish for your Hors d'Oeuvre from a buffet; there is plenty to choose from, including a large selection of salads and cold meats, so you would have to be incredibly fussy not to find something you like. The following two courses are a la Carte and then there is a dessert buffet selection, or ice cream, or a large selection of local cheeses. Breakfast is excellent too. My husband cannot eat gluten and the restaurant staff couldn't have been more helpful: they were fantastic, they really were. 

The rooms, like the rest of the hotel are spotless. I had the impression that the staff really care about the hotel. There are three pools; two thermae pools (one inside) and one outside and an unheated pool. I didn't venture into the unheated pool but was told it was pretty cold! However, it seemed that most people swan in the sea, or used the thermae pools. One word of advice; take some old swimwear for the thermae pools. The natural minerals stain your swimwear. I've washed the swimwear we wore twice now that I'm home and the staining hasn't totally come out. The minerals also stick to your skin a little- I had a bit of a shock the first time I used the pool, showered and then rubbed myself dry. The towel looked as those I'd been using fake tan! That said, the condition of my skin is now fantastic. It doesn't seem to affect your hair though, or at least it didn't mine. There is a changing cubical by the pools and so it's very easy to change from your sunbathing costume to an old one that you're not so fussed about! 

It's easy to walk into town from the hotel and the Castle is only about 1.5 mile walk away. Wear flat shoes if you intend to walk up there,there are an awful lot of steps but it's really worthwhile. The gardens and the various chapels are lovely. 

When we stayed there were mainly Italian, German and Russian guests. However, it probably just depends when you visit. I really do recommend the hotel: incidentally both our taxi drivers told us that it's the best hotel on the island! 
",5,2016,09,21
05,"ISCHIA, WHAT ELSE?","G.H. Punta Molino might be a bit outdated, if you wish but... the position is simply fantastic by the seaside with a lovely park. SPA is very well manned by Mrs Maria, and if you are going for your mud treatments, Mrs Antonietta is ""THE"" name! Obviously one of the best therapist I have ever met in my life (and being an ex-athlete I know what it means!) is Dr. William Esposito. Everybody speaks excellent English. Some of the rooms are ""old style"" but the service is excellent. Fantastic breakfast, excellent ""By the Beach"" bar with snacks. I would go out for dinner... this is the only point. But on top of it, I loved this place and I have been there on my own, with my husband and with friends.Do not forget the beach, pontoon and pool services mastered by Mr Franco who has a smile on his face from early morning till evening and always available!  Fantastic place and nice Staff.",5,2016,09,06
05,Amazingly awesome!!! Paradise on Earth,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel on a beautiful island of Ischia for the first time few weeks ago. This was an incredible, very relaxing and the most romantic vacation my wife and I had in years. The hotel is a gem - clean, with a direct access to the beach, tasty and health-conscientious local food selection. The staff was superb - professional, courteous, extremely helpful. The owner was on premises all the time, and made us all feel like at home with his innate friendliness and hospitality. The beach was amazing, with a water that cannot be described but must be experienced.
And the entire island is beautiful - typical picturesque Mediterranean resort.

We are coming back next year with parents, children and friends. Will definitely stay at Punta Molina.

Thank you for making our vacation so memorable",5,2016,08,10
05,Summer holiday 2016,Lovely rooms with nice beds. Room was large enough for 3 persons. Clean and modern rooms. Wifi was not so good in the room. Nice pool-area and beach. Helpful staff members. Ischia was a lovely place to visit.,5,2016,08,09
05,Wonderfully relaxing,"We have just spent nine days in a superior sea facing room and enjoyed the most wonderful holiday. Everyone who works there tried so hard to ensure that we had a lovely holiday, so thank you to the whole team. The views, room, food, and thermal pool were great. Unusually, there was no busy road in front of the hotel so it was quiet and traffic free. We especially enjoyed being able to walk straight to the small beach and bathing area to swim in the warm sea. Sun beds and towels were plentiful and always ready for us. If you have a massage ask for William, it was excellent. We shall return.",5,2016,07,26
05,Well-deserved paradise,"Great view from the room, sea-view plus parkview. Nice and helpful staff, clean areas, whatever we asked from the reception we get everything immediately.

05,Summer holiday 2016,"just spent 9 night at Punto Molino - it was lovely :) great location, amazing staff.
there are a few areas to improve: slow internet, had a hard time to connect, the beach area needs a good refurbishment.",5,2016,07,21
05,Over rated ,"Location is great. Facilities are average with some shortcomings. Gym is small - no bigger than a hotel room- and in un- air conditioned  area.  How likely is it to get use when it's 100 degrees ?  I would suggest the only reason they plunked one in there at all is to try and achieve a 5 * status. 
Air conditioning in the room - can't bring room temp below high 70's.  
Room itself ( ours was sea view ) is comfortable. Don't mistake sea view with ocean front.  I can see the water - past some buildings. 

Pool staff friendly. As is breakfast staff and breakfast itself was well presented. 

Front desk staff over worked I think.  Not unfriendly - but happy to ignore you if you walk by.  

Over all, it's a reach to call this a 5 star.

05,Flawless. ,"Just returned from a 6 night stay from the Punto Molino. It was just perfect. It ticks all the boxes for everything you need , pool area superb , rooms clean and very charming. Views from hotel second to none. Ideal location just a few minutes walk from the  centre ..The standout aspect has to be the staff, nothing was too much trouble. From Ciro the day concierge  (I hope I have name right ) to all reception staff to Salvatore at breakfast and the excellent and so lovely pool staff , they are a credit to the hotel and are the reason I will be returning & also recommending to some more Irish friends. I work in a hotel myself and know the demands of dealing with people but the staff of this hotel are top notch and made us feel so welcome. Thank you Punto Molina for being part of the reason we had the most magical time in the beautiful island of ischia...",5,2016,07,12
05,"Fab hotel, location and service","Our best ever holiday. Staff are truly amazing. Both Ciros!! And a fab barman as well. I love Italy so much and it's mainly down to the Italian people, how warm and welcoming.
Our room was fabulous. Great pool, great beaches/bathing areas. Pool attendants were so lovely. It's an old, classic hotel which oozes charm and memories. Great location. Would definitely return. We had a 5 year old who loved the hotel. He was like a fish in the pool and the beach. We had a great, family bonding holiday.
Only thing that could be improved would have to be the selection for breakfast. Not too bad in quality, but just not great selection.
We have been on holidays in Capri, Positano, Sorrento, Praiano and Northern Italy and this island is by far our favourite!!
Loved it!!",5,2016,07,10
05,Fabulous,"We really could not fault anything about this hotel. It was beautifully decorated with exquisite old furniture and Italianate tiles. The staff couldn't have done more for us and service at every meal was outstanding.  The food was delicious with an excellent choice of wines both local and otherwise.  Our room was clean, comfortable and well appointed and always cleaned early in the day.
The Pool area was kept clean and tidy and someone was always on hand to get you anything you wanted.  We will definitely return and soon.  We just loved it.  Keep up the good work",5,2016,07,02

Unfortunately, we got bad weather while we were there and the beaches were all closed. Didn't know that the beaches didn't open until June. It was very quiet. Spent a lot of time at the indoor salt pool which was amazing. Walked around in our robes and slippers to head down to breakfast and the pool. Breakfast was amazing. So much to choose from and you cant beat that view. This hotel is in walking distance to downtown and the port. We will definitely be coming back soon!",5,2016,06,23
05,Good hotel,My husband and I stayed here from 3rd June to 9th June.  It is a lovely hotel rooms are a bit small but very well kept and the staff work so hard they canot do enough for you. My only complaint was that the evening meal in the Restaurant needs to be a bit more relaxed and the food really is hit and miss. Overall a lovely holiday. The shops at the port are very good.,4,2016,06,15
05,A truly wondrous hotel,"From beginning to end, my stay at the Grand Hotel Punta Molino was a truly joyous occasion. All the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. The hotel is in an idyllic setting with stunning views of the bay of Naples, Aragonese Castle and delightful gardens. 

The restaurant was outstandingly great. Breakfast on the terrace was truly enjoyable.

Ischia is an exceptional place for a relaxing break, and when I visit in the future, this hotel shall definitely be my choice of stay.",5,2016,05,28
05,What more could you ask for,"We have just returned from a fabulous week at the Punta Molino, Ischia. What a wonderful hotel. The location of this hotel is beautiful. The food is excellent what a choice!!  The beach and sea are just perfect. Pool areas are excellent. The hotel grounds are a delight, beautiful gardens surround the hotel with a lovely array of beautiful flowerbeds. 
All the staff at this hotel are second to none. nothing is a problem.  Ciro, Andrea, Valeria, Katrina are wonderful so helpful. 
We had a lovely room on the third floor, with a balcony and view of the castle it was lovely and a side view of the sea.  
The room was spotless and the staff who looked after our room were excellent. 
The hotel is just a short walk from the main shopping area and port.
Ischia is a wonderful island and we cant wait to return to the island and off course the Punta Molino.",5,2016,05,18
05,Best in Town,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay. Only complaint-it was too short! As our cab driver said when we arrived, 'it is the best in town'. We had a really nice room on the first floor, big enough and with a large comfy bed, garden facing. The benefit of this and being half a mile out of town was that it was lovely and quiet. Be aware, however that by law (so I am told) the air conditioning cannot be switched on until the second week in May.
The hotel is very well situated between the Port and the Old Town, with plenty of bars and restaurants, if you must. The staff were really friendly and the food was excellent, to the extent that after only 3 days I am now on a diet. 
The common areas were beautifully furnished and immaculate, with the facilities well up to standard. Would I go back? Yes, like a shot but I would stay a bit longer. It's a long way to go for 3 days, but if you are already in Italy, it is well worth it. If not, best make it at least a week.",5,2016,05,10
05,"""What More Could you Want""","The hotel is a unique style with its curved facade and set in magnificent lush gardens and within easy walking distance of the main shopping street that runs all the way down to the ferry terminal. The interior of the hotel is just majestic and beautiful appointed. There are lovely areas that you can get away in peace and quiet and relax when you have finished with your swim. There are two pools, one of which is a mineral pool. The hotel has its own private beach and wharf. Towels are provided and laid out for you by the staff on your sun lounge. A raised deck/terrace has the outdoor bar area and restaurant. The buffet style breakfast served here was sensational plus the view looking out on the Bay of Naples while enjoying the feast was to die for. My room had a balcony and water view but was unfortunately positioned so that the people in the restaurant could look in. The room was a reasonable size and well appointed. There is an elevator to the upper floors. Free WiFi was supplied. I found the staff to be extremely helpful and attentive but some struggled with English. It is certainly a five star Italian hotel. I stayed three nights and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,11,11
05,Amazing,"This was a delayed honeymoon for us, and we were not disappointed!  The room was clean and comfortable,  although would have liked a Seaview.  The saffron were excellent,  they speak excellent  English.  We were the only British  couple there! The food was excellent, the location and amenities great",5,2015,10,18
05,Wonderful pool and outdoor bar space,"The common areas of the hotel are beautiful.  I was upgraded to an oceanview room.  The breakfast that was included was wonderful and served on the outdoor terrace.  There was easy access to the town, not a far walk from the main drag and easy cab ride to great restaurants.",5,2015,10,12
05,Not worth the 5 stars,"Our overriding memory of the hotel was the aloof and unfriendly attitude of the hotel staff.
I had informed the management that on the Friday it was my wife's 50th birthday and we would be eating in. When we came down to dinner they said we had not booked and made a fuss about the whole thing. 
If I was management I would have made every effort to accommodate my guests especially on a special occasion. That was the reason for our trip.",3,2015,09,14
05,A Grand Hotel indeed,"The best things about this grand hotel are the service, which is second to none, the meals, which are second to very very few whether in terms of quality or quantity, and its glorious position, right on the edge of the sea yet within a short walk of Ischia Porto and Ischia Ponte and with lovely views across the bay to Castello Aragonese, Capri and Sorrento. We stayed for four nights and were struck by the number of Italians who were quite evidently regular patrons, greeting others of like mind who had become their friends over the course of the years, as indeed had many members of the staff who were plainly of longstanding. The rooms were pleasant, and clean, if unspectacular, and the communal areas comfortable if a little dated. But a stay in this rather traditional hotel is a stay made by its staff, from the reception staff (who procured us a rental car at short notice against all the odds), to our head waiter and his team (with whom we enjoyed regular repartee) to the bagnini (who always found us deck chairs in a spot to our liking notwithstanding the various challenges which this task presented) and the charming pianist who tinkled the ivories while we enjoyed evening cocktails at sunset (and mucked in clearing the decks when the storms came in). Not everything about this hotel is five-star, but its  people most certainly are, and it is they that make this a grand hotel in which to stay.",4,2015,09,01
05,A beutiful hotel,This hotel was one that we had visited as wedding guests we were there for 8 hours or more the reception included a sit down meal and a buffet both types of meal were impeccable sea food sword fish risotto all were amazing the staff were working hard everything was so clean the hotel lays on the beach a stunning view of the castle the interior of the hotel is stunning this hotel is a must stay ,5,2015,07,30
05,Definitely the best,"Visited almost every hotel in. Ischia Port and this was probably the best with the most professional staff. None of the others lived up to a 5* or even 4* rating or anywhere near.  

The room that we had was a good size, very comfortable beds with a lovely balcony overlooking the castle. The hotel was quite old fashioned like most of them on Ischia however it was clean , traditional and with good service and we were very pleased with our choice.

The location was good. Half way between the port and the castle so within about 10 minutes each way. It was also in a quiet location overlooking the sea.  For those who like swimming  or want a cooling off from the heat be warned, almost all the swimming pools on ISchia are thermal and so warm water and therefore not suitable for swimming. Punta Molina offered a good sized pool which was COOL and so  was great for me as I enjoy swimming my 40 lengths every day. It was also a good size. There is also a separate small thermal pool too.  Many other hotels had tiny pools too.

Breakfast  was ok but nothing special. We had a couple of good light lunches by the pool though.

Initially,  I went onto booking.com and hotels.com and the prices were much lower than when I asked the hotels the best price that they could offer ( the day before). Even when I told them this they said that they couldn't offer the same price as booking.com despite the fact that they would be paying between 15 and 18% commission. Seems ridiculous especially at such last minute. The only hotel that was polite and understood my frustration was a lovely young man called Andrea at PUnta Molina.. He showed initiative, understanding and was very professional and tried to match the price as best he could with an upgrade. The rooms division manager and the concierge were also very helpful , friendly and professional and it was on this basis that we chose this hotel above the Excelsior , Miramare or the Moresco.  The reception staff are a credit to this hotel unlike any of the others",4,2015,06,28
05,I like it !,"My friends visit this hotel regularly and this September we went together. I liked the hotel from the first glance: nice location, nice views. Extremelly friendly personnel!!! Cuisine is excellent! My room was on the 4 floor with perfect sew view! Good beach! But this hotel is for those who is looking for quiet and relaxed holidays - you can enjoy your breakfast on a terrace, then relax on a beach, a short walk around town before dinner, and quiet evenings with soft music in the bar or terrace. What else is needed to forget about city life for a week or two? And will say once again - that it is the people working there who make you happy during the stay! My big thank you to all in Punta Molino!",5,2014,10,10
05,Very old hotel- 3 star maximum!,"We stayed in the hotel in August 2014: the hotel is very old (50years) without major renewal which you can feel everywhere. It is by far not 5 star-> 2-3* maximum.
1) Conditioner was not working well- so it was VERY hot at night
2) Rooms look and feel is very old (not only old fashioned but simply old!) which you can smell and see. Wardrobes are difficult to open with stains inside and they smell old wet wood- so becomes your cloth ;(
3) No one helped to take our luggage to the taxi- they even didn't look our side when we were leaving 
4) there was no normal hair dryer at the hotel- they explained it because of old electric system which can break down if they use powerful electrics ;) (I have long hair and it is critical for me not to spend 1 hour blow drying)
5) with all the above they charge as a luxury 5*-> 500€ per night! 

Yet, to say something good about Punto- nice SPA with friendly people and thermal pool... 

Now we are in St Caterina in Amalfi--> it is like heaven after Punto Molino! 

",1,2014,08,19
05,Punta Molino Paradise!,"This hotel has the best staff on the planet....fantastic views of the Mediterranean Sea, 3 pools, work-out area, great food, and a spa with thermal water that is second to none!   The owner, Eugenio goes out of his way to make sure  you have the time of your life in Ischia!   I'll be going back the Punta Molino for sure!!!",5,2014,07,22
05,LOVELY HOTEL IN WONDERFUL LOCATION,"Our first time on Ischia, we were delighted with both the picturesque island and the location of the hotel.  The reception staff are extremely pleasant, welcoming and helpful.  Our room was a double room with garden view, furnished in traditional Italian style and spotlessly clean.  (However, the view of the garden was somewhat limited).  The buffet breakfast is typically continental with something for everyone. Dinner is  served at your table with a buffet appetiser and dessert option - the food is excellent and the restaurant staff are all very friendly and attentive.  The guests were a mix of mainly Italians and Germans with some Brits and Russians, mostly over 50. Having stayed in other 5* hotels we would describe the Punta Molino as an excellent 4* hotel and would happily recommend it to others.  We are surprised at some of the negative comments we have read.",4,2014,07,05
05,Superb Hotel - can't wait to visit again,"We visited the Hotel Punto Molino in August 2013 as part of a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From the moment we arrived at the Punto Molino we were very well looked after by friendly and attentive staff.  We booked half board with the hotel and the dinner's were amazing.  Each night you get to choose from a buffet (which varies each night) and then you choose a starter and main course.  Desert is also selected from the buffet and the quality and choice of food was great.  We were given a special table for our first night to celebrate our anniversary.  The breakfast buffet was also very good.  
Another very good thing about this hotel is the thermal pool.  We sat in a warm thermal pool whilst it rained around us (the only rain of our holiday).  The bar at the hotel do excellent cocktails and the Don Rosario was particularly good (mixture of prosecco and limoncello).
We are looking forward to visiting this hotel again when we next return to Italy.",4,2014,03,19
05,"Great stay, lacked romance","We stayed here on honeymoon. We were upgraded on arrival to a sea view room - small, but clean, no bath - by a staff team who were hugely knowledgable, friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The punta molino is a great location as you are a short walk from ischia ponte and the stunning monastery - which you can admire from the hotel's private beach/jetty - and a slightly longer walk to the Porto with its shops and bars.

The hotel was nice enough, with a generous breakfast and lovely views from the terrace, but lacked the romantic sparkle that you'd expect from a five star hotel.  The crowd when we stayed were mostly older couples and families with adult children, largely central and eastern european. Loungers on the hotel's beach were often reserved by 8 am, but a word with the beach attendants usually sorted you something to lie on.  Great coffee.  We didn't eat in the restaurant other than bar meals, which were nice, if not terribly authentic Italian!  The thermal pool was nice, spa and gym facilites a little dated but serviceable.

In all, a good stay in a great location with lovely staff, but just lacking that little something special.",4,2013,11,09
05,False Advertising,"I booked this hotel thinking it would be 5 days of luxury in the middle of our trip to the Amalfi Coast. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

I took a lot of time looking online at hotels for this stay and picked this one because I thought it looked the best. It said somewhere that it was part of the Leading Hotels of the World group and I know they are really good. It later transpired they are not part of that group at all, even though it's all over the stationery etc. in the room. 

We arrived and the staff watched us struggle with our bags and didn't offer at any point to help us with them. When we got to the room I cried. I had paid extra for a sea view and our view was of a rusty roof and a speck of blue in the distance. The room had not been decorated since the 80s. The paint work was scuffed up, the lampshades by the bed were stained with big brown patches, the bathroom had mould and the panel you push to flush the toilet was so dirty I didn't want to touch it. It wasn't the modern room I had seen online and agreed to pay nearly £300 per night for. I would have been disappointed if I'd paid £70.

I went downstairs and complained and the manager laughed at me and said the hotel was full there was nothing he could do. I was upset, depressed and livid. I said it wasn't what I booked, it wasn't like the modern pictures on the website. The manager said because I had booked last minute we didn't get one of the newly modernised rooms. I said I booked in July for the end of September. Then he admitted they have only decorated 2 rooms. 

Because it's a small Island and hotel rooms are booked up way in advance we had no choice but to stay there. It was at this point we realised they had taken the Leading Hotels tag off the website but it was on everything in the room. 

My boyfriend went and complained again and we were told that we would be ""upgraded"" on our second night as a room would be free by then. Indeed we did move rooms for our second night but it wasn't really an upgrade. It was a bigger room but the paint was peeling and it was in much the same state as the first room. We did have a view of the sea but we also had the restaurant right below our window, so lots of noise at all hours of the day and night, including the piano man late into the night. It was like a weird take on a luxury hotel from 35 years ago. I couldn't have been more disappointed. 

I was so angry I had to stay here anyway because everywhere else was full. The bit of our holiday that was supposed to be a total treat was the worst bit. Even the pool was peeling on the bottom. 

The only good thing I have to say about it is that the breakfast was nice.

All I can say is: DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL IF YOU ARE EXPECTING 5 stars - it's not, it's not even 3.",2,2013,10,19
05,Beautiful spot spoilt by piano bar going on till 00.15 every night,"This is a fabulous spot, but if you have a seaview - beware. The 'pianoman' plays way too loud beyond midnight. I am a musician myself, the amp is far too high. Don't expect to sleep before 00.30. Manager didn't want to know when I asked to make it quieter. Spoilt the visit for me. 
Selfish musician.",5,2013,08,29
05,Fabulous stay,What a great hotel!!! It's the perfect place for holidays. The beach and the sea are just perfect. The restaurant at the hotel is simply the best in Ischia. The staff is no nice like a big family. One of the best hotel I have even seen. I really recommend this wonderful five stars hotel.,5,2013,08,25
05,"Take care when choosing Grand Hotel Punta Molino Terme in Ischia, Italy for a vacation!","We couldn’t help wondering what makes a luxury hotel after our deceiving experience at the Grand Hotel Punta Molino Terme in Ischia, Italy.

We had booked a junior suite and a double room from July 26th to August 1st, 2013, based on the photos the hotel listed on booking.com, yet we used a travel agent. As we arrived late on Friday, July 26th, the so-called junior suite provided to us was no bigger than a double deluxe room in a normal 5-star hotel and a little bigger than the double room in their hotel (although it cost 200 euro more per night)! More than that, the junior suite was placed right on the restaurant terrace which proved noisy and full of aromatic odors. When we decided to leave the very evening we had arrived, they said we will not get any refund as the package was fully paid in advance! Nevertheless, they promised to change our junior suite with the best and largest junior suite which they called new style with no additional cost from Monday, July 29th which they did. Maybe our initial reservation had been given to someone else for the weekend right before we arrived, the hotel being fully booked over that weekend!

During our discussions the personnel proved unprofessional being sometimes rough and impolite. We asked for a taxi, they said 5 minutes’ wait and 15 minutes later when we asked again about our taxi they needed to call another which took 15 more minutes. We were under the impression that they had their “regular” taxi driver and that he needed more time. They front desk clerks only provide the information they want or they have an interest in: for example they only present the schedule of a part of the transfer boats to Naples of Capri.

Transfer from Naples Airport to the hotel was way below 5-star expectations, it took longer that the estimates they provided by them before booking. We gave up the return transfer! 

Prior to our arrival we had booked Spa procedures each day starting from 27.07.2013 between 12,00 and 14,00 all 3 clients together till 01.08.2013, except on Sunday when the Spa was closed. When we got there, the Spa knew nothing about our appointments. We gave it up and fully enjoyed the Poseidon garden, spa and pools. 

Inside the rooms towels are old and deteriorated. Hair blowers are out of date and really unusable (out of the 4 rooms we changed, 2 had this problem!). 

The lounge chairs by the pool are insufficient for the hotel capacity and the towels they provide for pool and beach are ragged and discoloured. It is really difficult to find one of the 3 persons dealing with towels by the pool and beach: we had to address the Spa to phone for them after waiting for an hour!

Cuisine is fine although not diversified and nothing is offered! 

There is no room service after mid-night. Once, we asked for 2 bottles of water and 3 glasses and the reception clerk himself came to the room holding in hand the bottles and 3 plastic glasses!

Although the hotel presentation on channel 15 and the promotional materials in the room state they are part of the Leading Hotels of the World, they admit to be out of the network for some time.",2,2013,08,09
05,Grand Hotel Punta Molino,"Myself and my family had a wonderful holiday at the Grand Hotel Punta Molino, in Italy. The hotel and rooms were of a high standard. The concierge and staff were most helpful at all times, the restaurant and food were delightful.  I must add that the facilities for sunbathing were more than adequate providing clean towels each day for the sun beds and once again the staff in attendance were very helpful. There was a good variety of shops and restaurants within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I would have no hesitation of returning for a second visit which is certainly going to be on our agenda. 

I thank Just The Ticket for arranging a superb holiday who went to great lengths to make sure our requirements were catered for in every respect. I would most definitely recommend their services and advice, their contact details are as follows: Just The Ticket, Marylebone Street, London. Tel: 0207 291 8118",5,2013,07,25
05,Ischia June 2013,"Went to Ischia for the first time this year. Brilliant location and lovely stuff. However food wasn't  upto 5 star standard, particularly dinner. Unfortunately our room neighbour was a smoker so teh whole room stink of cigaretes, otherwise will def recommend it to my friends and we are plannign to come back next year.",4,2013,07,10
05,Excellent....,"Wonderful spot, with amazing views.  Food has always been good, although this time, it was very evident that there was a new chef. Still good, but some aspects not as good.

All of the staff are excellent - restaurant staff, front of house, and housekeeping. Pool people are second to non. 

Realise that the hotel will be a little quiet for some people, but it suits me!",5,2013,07,10
05,Perfect,"Celebrated my cousin’s wedding at this great hotel on the 4 August, 2012.  Coming from Sydney (Australia) I found the service excellent with abundance and delicious food and of course, spectacular views.  I compliment the staff for making us feel very welcomed.",5,2012,09,19
05,Disappointing,"Just returned from punta molino and feel very disappointed, we booked a garden villa which we thought would provide privacy, however don't be misled by website pictures. The room we were given had no terrace just a tiny balcony which was overlooked by everyone staying in the hotel. When asked if another room was available was told no they were all booked, however the villa in the same block with a large terrace was unoccupied our whole stay. The average age of guests is 60-70 so if you are much younger please be aware of this. The sunbeds are also an issue which the management do not seem to help or support you with if you have difficulty in finding a sunbed. Guests reserve their beds with the beach attendants and whetther these are being used or not they refuse to let you have one. The only ones they will give you are the ones that are shaded from lunch time in spots no one else wants. Certainly not a 5 star hotel, perhaps location is worth 5 stars but rooms and food is certainly not.",3,2012,09,16
05,Fantastic location and services,"I spent 10 days in the Hotel Punta Molino with my family. This has been a perfect holiday. The hotel is based on one of the most beautiful island in the world. The hotel facilities are outstanding. You get the beach, the spa , the food and an excellent service. Very efficient with a touch of Italian kindness.",5,2012,07,10
05,Not up to standard,"Expectations are high for a hotel claiming to be a 'Leading Hotel of the World' and standards fell well short. Pool are was small with lots of steps to go and order a drink as no poolside service. Beach was grey and full of pebbles but eh beach bar was efficient, friendly and reasonably priced. Rooms comfortable but small. The place needs a complete renovation .",3,2012,06,13
05,Hidden gem on a magical island.... plus a perfect location for our wedding!,"If you are considering a visit to the beautiful island of Ischia and looking for somewhere to stay then look no further... 

The hotel is situated in a perfect location, with wonderful sea views and the famous castle in the backdrop. The food is always (and I mean always) superb and the wonderful service has brought us back time and time again (for over 14 years!). My family and I see the same faces of both the customers and the staff year after year, which only highlights how magical this place really is.  

We were lucky enough to get married here in 2011. One of the many reasons for choosing Ischia was because of the Punta Molino and they didn't disappoint. We were overwhelmed with how special they made our day - the food and personal touch was out of this world the 100 guests were able to share our best kept secret. I think its safe to say that quite a few more people fell in love with Ischia and the Punta Molino last year and have booked return trips for 2012! 

This really is a special place and it holds many wonderful memories we will always cherish.

James & Nina",5,2012,01,23
05,Friendly staff and great food,"The best aspects of this hotel are the friendly staff, the great menus at dinner and the hotel facilities including the pools, beach and gardens.
Book a room with a sea view and balcony. I was in room 215 and although the view was not completely uninterrupted, we could see the sea and the balcony was pleasant to sit on, particularly when some amazing fireworks were let off as part of a festival. Absolutely brilliant.
The rooms were immaculate, the twin beds comfortable and every night we received a turn down service with chocolates left on our pillows. Robes and slippers were also provided.
Great bathroom with plenty of hot water at a good pressure. 
The breakfast was served in an open air dining area with an overhead sunscreen and was extensive - breads, toast, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, melon, yoghurt, actimel, cold meats, cheese, cereal, fruit juices, water and even Prosecco - and the waiters will ask you what coffee you want so you can choose an espresso or capuccino rather than get served a bland generic tourist coffee. The breakfast was also served from 8am to 10.30am which was very relaxing.
The hotel grounds are immaculate and one night we had a gala dinner with champagne and drinks served in the garden before an amazing dinner with numerous courses. Most people dress for dinner and the gala dinner asks for 'a touch of elegance' although there were some gents who turned up in jeans and polo shirts.
The food really is five star here and I am always cautious when booking half board, but wow, what a selection and great quality. The wine list only has Italian wines which is understandable and there are some rather nice Ischian wines available. Most evenings there was some sort of entertainment ie a pianist or singer. We didn't hang around for this but many people did.
The hotel clientele were mainly German and Russians and aged 50-plus and up to late 70s and most of them were very well fed to put it politely, so ladies, please don't worry about going on any crash diet to look good on the poolside or beach. No-one cares and you can relax. There were two pre-school children at the hotel when we were there, who were very well behaved, but there isn't much for children to do apart from use the pool and the beach, although it is packed with loungers and is not a swathe of golden sand.
The main pool was empty most of the time and the mineral pool was also used very little but it is amazing. It is about 36 degrees and there are lots of bubbling jets if you push the buttons on the poolside. It's great using this pool then taking a dip in the swimming pool.
We never had a problem getting a lounger but we did stay at the hotel from September 5 and it wasn't too busy.
The beach is also pleasant with a toilet, changing facilities and a shower room. At first it appears that people have reserved loungers by putting books and magazines on them, but it was the hotel beach attendant who does this. I am not sure why. We always got a lounger. Choose the ones away from the sea front as these can get wet when big ships pass by sending waves crashing against the sea wall.
We took snorkels and there is a bit of sea life to watch. On the beach is a little cafe called Cristinas and although it looks basic, it serves some smashing traditional food at a fraction of the cost of the hotel.
We had some great calimari, bruschetta and beer of course. Great coffee too. They are also very friendly.
We didn't use the health spa but I did pop into the gym where the indoor swimming pool is. It's very, very hot in the gym area which is separated from the pool with screens. There is a cross trainer, treadmill and bike and weight machine. The machines are pretty primitive, but you can get an hour of calorie burning in before tucking into a great evening meal. The gym and pool facilities are free and clean towels and a free water machine is available in the gym. There are no staff manning the gym, you just help yourself which is nice.
The hotel is a pleasant ten minute walk into the main shopping/restaurant area on typical cobbled streets. There is a road along the seafront which is good for running, although it is very hot and quite humid so a walk or jog is best done in the evening.
The castle is about a 25 minute walk but this is also pleasant. The island is busy, bustling and the people very friendly.
The hotel staff are very helpful and nothing is too much trouble. We made our own way to the hotel from Naples airport and on the way home we asked the concierge to organise it for us which was done efficiently. A taxi took us to the port in Ischia, our ferry tickets were organised and our luggage placed on the ferry. A limo collected us at the port in Naples and took us to the airport for just 55 Euros each, not much more than using public transport and organising it yourself.
I can't praise the staff enough who are so friendly and kind without being intrusive. There is also a small library of books in the reception area and ask the concierge for wi-fi access which is free while you stay and he/she will issue with a code to log in.
I would return to this hotel and this lovely island which has so much to offer and fewer tourists than the Amalfi coast and other parts of Italy.",5,2011,09,25
05,"Good, but not 5* Grand","The Molino is positioned close to the beach with stunning views towards prochida and the Aragonese Castle. The hotel is very clean and the Spa Centre is very good. The food is good but not exceptional and the service in the resturant was inconsistant and sometimes caotic. The deal we got with Citalia was very good value, the room allocated to us was spacious considering we opted for a standard room. Would I go back, probably, but the staff need to get much better at understanding that it is the detail which makes an hotel stand out from the rest!",3,2011,09,25
05,Spa hotel,"Excellent service and food delicious,however rooms without seaview can be dark,avoid groundfloor rooms as even darker.Had noisy neighbours one night and although full hotel staff superb and found us another room transferring our luggage whilst we had breakfast with no fuss. The staff are the highpoint of this hotel which undoubtedly the best on the island",5,2011,09,20
05,Sadly disappointing for 5 Star hotel.,"Sadly the Punto Molino in Ischia is not 5 Star across the board. Room not bad 4*.
Breakfast 3* do not go if you cannot eat dairy products, service was slow for drinks and I do not like bacon almost raw, although I tackled this on the second day nothing changed. I have never been 5 * without a chef being on hand to cook eggs, omlettes, pancakes and waffles. On the second day there was a pigeon standing on the fruit in the middle of the fruit table pecking at the fruit, on informing staff the bird was got rid of but all the fruit stayed waiting for guests who had not witnessed the pigeon. Evening meal was 5*. Lunch snacks were very poor at the bar 3*. Swimming pool was excellent but poorly managed as guests thought that if they placed an object on a sunbed it was theirs for the day, guests had reserved sunbeds that were never used because the guests must have decided to stay out all day, they should really follow the Aminta Hotel's (Lake Maggiore) example of sunbed managment. I concur with a previous critic that the receptionist in the spa was not a friendly person. Very few rooms seem to have uninterupted sea views so consider carefully if that is worth paying extra for. We had a fairly good holiday in Ischia despite the above but would not return to The Punto Molino unless the above criticisms were addressed.",3,2011,09,19
05,Lovely hotel but one haughty lady!,"On arrival from the Four Star Hotel Royal in Sorrento, we were initially disappointed by the five star Punto Molino as although we had not paid for a room upgrade, we didn't have a balcony. After a few exchanges with the hotel reception staff who appeared to give conflicting information about the rooms on offer, and after the intervention of or Citalia rep, Rosetta, we were given a balcony room the following day with the staff taking care of the moving process. 

The food is excellent with prosecco at breakfast and a good choice of menu in the evening.  I really liked the way that the food is brought to the table in tureens and served to you individually.  There is a good and reasonably priced wine list.

All the staff have been very helpful, except one: the extremely haughty receptionist at the spa.  She does not know how to smile, make eye contact or greet you with anything other than a sneer.  After our intial consultation with the friendly doctor, she just began allocating sessions to us, without making any conversation.  She appeared to think it was strange that we might want to chose when we wanted the treatments. When we arrived for our first session we were kept waiting without any form of greeting and when we asked she shrugged, grudgingly uttering un momento.  Needless to say we left without waiting any further.  Unfortunately she lets what is otherwise a good hotel down.",3,2011,09,13
05,Excellent in every way,"When planning to visit Ischia it was not easy deciding on where to stay as so few people we know had actually stayed there - only visited for the day from the mainland.  We finally decided on Punta Molino Hotel after some help from the Trip Advisor Forum - many thanks everyone !  

We were not disappointed - this is an exceptionally well run hotel thanks to the excellent management.  It is perfectly located with impeccable service throughout.  We booked half board which was a very good move as the food was of a high standard and the attentive service in the restaurant  left us wanting for nothing.

We opted for a front sea view superior room with balcony which was perfect - the room was bright and cheery and we we had lovely views from the balcony.  It was spotlessly  clean as was the whole hotel.

We are quite well travelled and have stayed in several good hotels around the world and would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone looking for a 4*+ hotel on the island - we enjoyed our stay very much and hope to return.",5,2011,07,13
05,Wow- What a find,"We decided we would visit the Bay of Naples and planned a trip spending three days in Naples, Sorrento, and Ischia. It was good fortune that we found the Punta Molino, a five star hotel in Ischia: we appeared to be the only British people there. From the moment we were greeted we knew we were in a hotel oozing with charm, efficiency and class. Our room, which was one of the lesser ones, was a delight, had its own balcony  and was kept spotlessly clean by unobtrusive staff. We took a half board package booked through Citalia and would recomend the half board deal. The food was perfect and the staff of the highest order; they immeadiatly knew us by name and were friendly, courteous and helpful with choices of both food and excellent wine. 
 The hotel has one indoor pool and two outdoor. I have to say we never got past the outside natural thermal pool which was at a temperature of 35 degrees and incorpoated water jets to massage tired muscles. The Hotel is a Spa and has an amazing array of treatments; it is an ideal base to expore the island and then relax in the spa suite a sample of which was included in our package. 
 The Island of Ischia is large enough to be interesting and small enough to get around easily using the inexpensive bus service; we purchased a two day pass which took us everywhere for under 7 euro all in. Our favourite visit was to a garden created by William Walton's wife, Susanah, which was immaculately kept and had stunning views of the bay with seats to appreciate the surroundings in comfort.
 I do not think that the hotel is suitable for activity focused thrill seekers; there were no tennis courts, bicycles or watersports but for discerning adults who like comfort, brilliant food, friendly staff and relaxation amid a beautiful island; this is the place for you. We have seldom been to better.",5,2011,05,09
05,"Popular with an older crowd, needs some updating, definately not ""trendy""","After reading that this hotel was listed in the ""Leading Hotels in the World"" guide we were optimistic and looking forward to our stay at the Punta Molina which we had booked through an agent.
On arrival we were met with smiles and shown to our room which was spotless however very small.  The room did have the sea view advertised however we were looking over a large expanse of flat roof and then between some other structures to view a slice of ocean.  
The shower room was small and you had to perform a slight shuffle to be able to get in and close the door behind you.  Once in you had everything that you needed including one of the smallest shower cubicles that we had ever used.
We had informed the travel company that I was pregnant so the complementary bottle of Spumante was enjoyed by my husband and after the compulsary consultation with their Doctor (who asked several personal questions!?!) I was advised that I should not use their pools and they would rather not carry out any spa treatments on me which was a real shame as many of the guest did seem to be enjoying the use of the spa and facilities (I should point out that I am fit and healthy and in my early 30's)
There was a cabaret act singing each evening which was enjoyed by the older guests.
After a sweltering first night eased by opening the windows which meant that we were then kept awake by the noise we mentioned that our air con was not working to the chap on reception who agreed with us that there was no air-con working in our room (great, very helpful!)
The Hotel are clearly proud of their inclusion  in the Leading Hotels Guide with copies of the guide on every surface and even on their toiletry bottles however we have definately stayed in much, much nicer hotels with a more luxurious feel.  Perhaps the hotel was in its day quite fabulous however I am still trying to work out how they get away with claiming it to be 5 star!??!!  We would say 3 or 4 at a push
P.S. Inkeeping with the rest of the Hotel they only had one rather ancient PC on which guests could access the internet and that crashed immediately before I could check my e-mails.  Staff response was ""sorry I dont know how to fix it""  Of course with a very friendly smile :-)",3,2011,05,04
05,A stunning resort in an amazing island!!,"I just got back from a quite and relaxing weekend in the Ischia island. Following an advice given by a friend I decided to book a junior suite room in this resort. Set apart in an amazing landscape, I spent one of the best holidays ever! 
The food was really good and the staff extremely helpful. The amenities, ranging from several swimming (also fed by fresh water) to an all-inclusive Spa, contributed to make our stay even more enjoyable.",5,2011,04,17
05,The perfect spot in Ischia Porto..had a great experience!!,"Last summer I spent one week here to get away from the intense London life with my boyfriend. Well, it was worth any single penny as it proved an amazing holiday in the best venue I could have thought of! Can only say good about the hotel and would definitely recommend it for a holiday in the perfect location of Ischia.
The hotel is literally two steps away from the seaside..we simply had to cross the street to be on the beach!!! and our room had a breat-taking view of Ischia's characteristic Aragonese castle, which is definitely worth a visit! Not only we could easily walk to the beach, but we could also be in the very heart of Ischia porto in a matter of few minutes thanks to the hotel's convenient location. Indeed we were incredibly close to the main shopping and nightlife area, but at the same time set apart from the crowd in a very romantic venue facing Naples and its islands.. The standard of rooms and service was excellent...not to say the food, I would say above any standard!! truly delicious for any meal we had at the cozy restaurant overseeing the sea. Plus, it's a gorgeous hotel with fine furnishings and exceptional amenities..indeed we indulged in deeply relaxing treatments at the hotel's Spa, which I believe is a key point of the hotel.
What to say, we had an amazing experience!!! I'll definitely go back!",5,2011,02,06
05,I love it!!,"I stayed at Grand Hotel Punta Molino this September for a long weekend. 
I really loved it. The service was excellent, the room had an amazing view, it was nicely furnished and with nice ambiance.  The hotel has a very good location, on the beach and at walking distance from the centre, shops and restaurants. It has a unique view on the Castle Aragonese and the island of Procida. very romantic!
I will definetely return. In fact I am planning to go back next summer!!",5,2010,12,01
05,5 star in name only,"This hotel is polular with Germans, about 90%. Sunbeds are taken early and not managed by the hotel as you would expect from a quality hotel. Bar staff are competent and friendly, The restaurant in the evening resembles an old peoples home and the food is poor. The staff are not competent silver service. At lunch courses were dumped on our table while eating previous courses so staff could close up and turn out the lights, Amazing! ooms are average but avoid putting cloths on top shelves in the wardrobes as these are not dusted. The hotel falls well short of 5 star hotels on Capri and on the Amalfi coast. It is stuck in a time warp and is not representative of the high standards you find at 5 star hotels in Campania. What a shame.",2,2010,09,28
05,Elegant hotel with outstanding service,"My wife and I stayed at the Punta Molino for a week and thoroughly enjoyed it. Check-in was extremely swift and we were showed to our room almost immediately. Although we were initially disappointed with the room (due to the balcony overlooking the front entrance) the hotel were swift to offer us an aternative which we decided against. To be fair it was OUR fault for not booking a room with a sea view instead we had a garden view. That said the room was spotlessly clean, sufficiently cooled and had all the amenities you would expect. The only flip side was that the bed i.e. mattress was rock hard.

Service at the hotel is extremely good. Professional, courteous, dignified and friendly. The Maire' d (Francesco) was an absolute delight and took the time to learn our names and always enquire as to our wellbeing. The waiting staff were very professional and attentive. Pool staff, bar staff and reception staff were equally as professional AND approachable with a smattering of English (in some cases excellent) and willing to engage with me in my attempts to improve my Italian. Special thanks to both Luigi and Antonio in the dining room and the excellent Santangelo in the bar.

Food is first class with an excellent breakfast buffet, a la carte or snack lunch and a four course dinner every night. The dinner was a wonderful buffet antipasto, followed by a regional pasta, meat/fish and dessert. Not once could I have complained about the food and the only slight I had is that sometimes the courses came a little too quickly allowing little respite.

The pool area IS small but there is also a small beach with two sunbathing decking areas so there is plenty of room for all.

It is only a short (10 minute) walk to the main piazetta where there is a nice selection of both lively and quiet bars.

All in this is a very good hotel indeed. Recommended for couples who are looking for a quiet break on a beautiful island",4,2010,09,06
05,"I had a good time, a good hotel with some weak spots.","1) it's a good hotel with high level of service, good facilities and great food
2) the beach is relatively small but it seems adequate although a bit cramped and crowded at times
3) it shows a bit of ageing in small details, a bit of rust here a bit of rush there but fundamentally it's still a good hotel
4) the food is really nice although not 100% perfect. Some of the ""antipasti"" items could easily be removed highlighting the nicer stuff. I had half board and both breakfast and dinner were nice. I didn't try the cooked breakfast but the continental breakfast was excellent.
5) drinks and foods outside the half board treatment are expensive, something like 10 euros for a iced coffee
6) i didn't try the spa (fully booked every time I tried) and I didn't try the outdoor hot water mini pool because it was too hot; the indoor warm water pool (small) near the (small) gymn, is really nice and convenient after some exercise but it shows some ageing (the water jets didn't work) 
7) my room (single) was a bit small but very clean and the bathroom was almost as big as the room. The desk chair was uncomfortable and so was the armchair, but I had a small balcony with sea view and a view of the fortress and an extra chair and table on the balcony
8) air conditioning was ok, but not too cold so possibly americans or similar people used to blasting air conditioning full power, will think there is not airco;
9) a lot of communal spaces, with comfy sofas indoor and outdoor, where to sit relax, read etc; 
10) furniture is dated and kitsch and could do with a revamp.
11) internet in the room via ethernet cable and wifi in communal areas. 5euros for 24hrs over 7 days, not a bad deal.

Overall a great place and although expensive I would go back anytime, the people working there are really nice and the service is excellent.",4,2010,08,27
05,As good as ever.,Our fifth visit running and all as good as in my review of 2006. Citalia had an excellent promotion involving free spa treatment. The spa may contribute to the five star rating which some reviewers question although not questioned by  the other annual visitors we always meet or the two couples we have recommended. There are  a number of five star hotels in Italy which we could all  name and which would cost up to half as much again and it is really a question of value for money -- Punta Molino is great value and really it matters really very litle whether or not you see 5 stars or four and a half stars if you are happy with what you get for your money.,5,2010,07,09
05,Great experience!,"Was at Punta Molino last summer for 5 days. I know Ischia quite well and this was the second time at Punta Molino. It's a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Great position very close to the beach, very good food and an excellent spa.

The rooms are very nice, we got a superior.",5,2010,01,11
05,Truly Dolce Vita,"We spent two lovely weeks at Punta Molino in July 2009 with my spouse and our middle son who turned 5 at the resort. Surely we enjoyed the place! It was recommended to us by a friend and I did not regret a single second and I still owe my friend a beer.
This is not a place for those who wishes to have enternainment all around. It is certainly not a large piece of property as this is not the case for almost every property in Ischia.
Having read all reviews before I became a bit worried (as always) before flying out there. Thanks God many of the worries dissapeared. The details? Here they are:

Accommodation. 
We stayed at Junior Suite Villa. This was a far better choice for us than regular rooms in the main building. First we liked the ground floor and we got that. Second the suites in the Villa have patio - the fact that we loved immensely. Third you enjoy a piece of privacy there. There are two significant disadvantages though about accommodation at this hotel. 
First is the service. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but not perfect - it was the first time when we get into situation when we hung out ""Do not disturb"" and went for breakfast but when we got back, our room was serviced! I assume they were very anxious to finish service on time disregarding what their guests want.
Second is the sound. The term 'soundproof' is, well, not about this place at all. Often we fealt like living in a cardboard house. You hear almost every noise upstairs and outside of the room. A friendly chat of gardener and service maid in the morning (if you now Italians) will certainly wake you up if not it was the same maid moving chairs upstairs ten minutes earlier.

Dining. 
This is absolutely the hotel catch. Forget about breakfasts and lunches - although they are good overall - dinners at Punta Molino are something worth the trip. At dinners you get the same reserved table - a very rare feature at many luxury hotels, though a regular at cruise ships. The menu varies and it is stunning. Food is delicious as well as wine and the service is really first class. After couple of days you get used to that and you start to really looking forward to the next dinner. The food is not everything there though. Somehow the staff managed to create a truly dolce vita atmoshpere. Guests are elegantly dressed (apart from few Russians :-)), food is serviced by the table, you do not need to finish you wine - they will bring it tomorrow, view is majestic, staff knows you by name - what else some of you expect from a perfect holiday? Because the hotel is small and everyone is sitting at their own tables, you, as well as other guests, start to recognise each other and appreciate the company of each other. I wish I could speak Italian...

Beach and leasure. 
To my mind the beach is absolutely enough in size for this hotel. Beachmen are lovely and there was never a case when we were left without sunbeds. There are two main areas at the beach (I skip the place around the pool as this was not our goal). The one to the left has more difficult approach to sea for kids when the sea is rough as there are some stones in the water - though there is an easy access there through the public beach. The one to the right is free from any stones, but for some reason we only used that when there were waves.
The good thing to do is to hire a small motor boat through the beachmen (I suspect this is the major source of their revenue for living) to go around the island - these little boats have tents and showers so they are good for snorkelling and just sightseeing We did that for our son birthday and we were all happy.

Other hotel amenities and services.
The hotel is furnished in style and actually did not leave me with an impression of being tired as was mentioned in some reviews. Public areas are well maintained, staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel CEO is an absolutely lovely character who adds a true charm to the place. Again, the hotel is relatively small and hence they track down the birthdays of each guest and present them with a birthcake at dinner!

Around hotel.
This is Ischia at its best to our view. This island is not splashing money around - the main shopping area is far from Capri or Sardinia. But it is full of Italian charm and hospitality. Safe and relatively quite. After the second stroll the owners start to recognise you and greet you.

Pool and spa.
Pool is nice. Someone wrote that it is shaded in the afternoon. As a Russian family brought up in a place where 30 sunny days a year is a fortune, we actually enjoyed swimming in the shade in the afternoon. The other attraction is a thermal water pool which is always really warm (+37C) and is under the sun and yes, it bubbles if you press a button. My wife tried the spa but was not extremely impressed about it, though I met a lady from Yorkshire who was visiting this spa for 24 years in a row - something remarkable I believe.

Getting to and from the hotel.
Group transfers are normally organised by buses and ferries. We strongly recommend to use personal transfers. It took us around 5 hours after we touched down in Napoli airport to get to the hotel. On the way back we were supposed to be picked up from the hotel at 3.50 am to get to the first ferry to get to the airport at 6 am to spend two hours at the closed check in desk. Instead we booked a private transfer through the hotel reception for few extra euros. We were picked up at 6.10 am and were in the airport by 7.45 to check in in 15 minutes.

All in all - this is a genuine one of the best small hotels of the world at least among those that I visited - and I saw a few. I felt priveleged of staying there and being able to feel the true Italian hospitality. It is not cheap, but for sure worth it.",5,2009,08,11
05,As good as ever,"Our third visit to this comfortable and relaxing hotel and the more we return the more it feels like home. As usual the staff are wonderful and the atmosphere very friendly. Do not be put off by the hotel brochure which makes it look very formal, it is far from being so. Casual dress is apparent everywhere and ‘smart casual’ dining is accepted as the norm.

The hotel does hold a ‘special dinner’ evening which has been taken on the garden terrace when we have stayed there and the invite to this advises guests that ‘a little of your elegance would be appreciated’. Having said that ‘T’ shirts and slacks were still worn by some male guests but did not look out of place.

Our room this time was not as immediately appealing as earlier visits, when we had a bath / shower, and the room was of quite generous proportions. This year we had only a shower and the room, although with a sea view, appeared a little tired with its dark stained furniture and stained doors. It was however comfortable enough, although slightly on the small side. This would not put us off going again but to be sure of getting a bath rather than just a shower it might be worth going for a room upgrade.

At the beginning of our week’s stay the availability of sun beds around the pool was a problem as in previous years but the hotel appeared a little quieter just prior to our departure on the 5th September when a wider choice of sun beds was available.

The food was, as ever, excellent (part buffet and part waiter service) with good quality meat and the tenderest of beef but also traditional Italian pasta, fish and an excellent varied buffet) as a first and sweet course.

Ischia is so appealing as an island and the ferry transfers from Naples, in both directions, via Citalia, were smoothly executed without any delays and only a few minutes wait at the ferries. Flights from Bristol with Thomas Cook, all via Citalia, were equally as good and on time.

Hotel guest are of mixed nationality with a few British guests, some who have returned to the hotel a number of times.

The hotel’s location is excellent and our visit coincided with a festival on the 1st September which was spectacular, involving a procession of boats and fireworks in front of the hotel followed by a procession through the streets and a finale firework display at midnight. We unfortunately missed the midnight display due to my wife sustaining a serious head injury in a fall in the street on the night of the festival, having to spend two nights in hospital on the island. An Italian hospital stay is not an experience we would recommend whilst on holiday but was one which was made more acceptable by the kind help of the Citalia concierge ‘Mena’ who gave us her total personal attention, visited the hospital and assisted with the communication. She was brilliant. This is one of the benefits of booking via an agent and not booking independently. We would also thank the hospital for the care she received whilst there and although language did prove to be difficult at times we were able to get by, one nurse at admissions speaking some English and an Irish, Italian speaking, male ward nurse helping considerably.

The island itself is still as beautiful as ever although a little marred, in part, by an apparent increase in graffiti in Ischia Port, the main town where the hotel is located.

A few pointers regarding your visit. 

Traffic in and around Ischia Port is manic and more akin to central London than a relaxed island but does have that Italian charm of chaos. Incidentally Italians seems to accept that cars and scooters might appear from any direction and they do not display the English ‘road rage’ characteristics.

 Beware of taxi prices, these are very expensive £20 for a short journey from one side of town to the other (ask for a price before you get in), or better still get a weekly bus ticket if your going further afield via the regular services which circle the island. Alternatively negotiate a deal but be sure that you get the service you are expecting. My hospital visits cost between £20 - £30 for each thirty minute journey.

Also, beware of restaurants offering ‘true Italian food’, particularly at Ischia Port. We heard stories of guests having two main fish courses, costing £40 each, and two other guests who were treated to a typical Italian lunch at the port( lasagne we understand) costing £120 for the two!! Ask for a menu or better still lunch on the beach in Christina’s Bar ( close to Punta Molina), where Calamari, melon / ham, water, wine and coffee for two cost us no more than £30 for two. There are other similar beach bars close to the hotel which are equally competitive and provide that unique Italian style.

Also, if you fancy some clothes shopping beware, you might think Mayfair is cheap after visiting these shops!!

If you going out and about some essential visits are:

The Aragonese Castle, A characteristic castle on the outskirts of town, which is an imposing construction some 115m height on a tiny island connected to Ischia by a narrow dam. The castle contains a serene but uncultivated garden, a terraced restaurant, a comfortable café with spectacular views and is within easy walking distance of the hotel.

Mortella Botanic Gardens at Forio, created by Sir William Walton, the English composer which lies on an enormous volcanic rock, hosting more than 800 rare species of plants. Catch a bus just above the port and stop at some of the coastal towns on the way for a bit of shopping and coffee or enjoy an evening concert. 

Sant Angelo .A busy but attractive beach destination, which is located on the southern coast of the island and is a pretty mixture of hotels and houses, piled higgledy-piggledy on the hill facing the sea.

To summarise an island to either visit and site see or stay put around your hotel and soak up the true Italian character.",5,2008,09,07
05,value for money ?????,"This is a good hotel , but to be honest it is not a 5 star hotel.

The hotel is set in its own well kept grounds and is meticulously clean, which is not the case outside the hotel where the surrounds are dirty, grafitti adorns walls and you take your life in your own hands avoiding vans and cars on narrow roads. The main town is about 10 minutes walk, which older people in heat may find taxing

The rooms are smaller than you would expect, the bathrooms are  not up to modern standards and  must be considered basic .  The pools at the hotel are small and suprisingly lie in the shade in the afternoons, the beach is outside the hotel grounds and is  only a couple of square yards, however there are  other places reserved for guests on pontoons and a  small rocky headland. Getting a sun bed  for the day is an early morning exercise.

The reception  and housekeeping staff were excellent, being helpful, friendly and efficient. The restaurant and bar personnel  were however of a more unpredictable nature, I suspect that they are not a happy team. The food was average, and not up to 5 star standard. Even though we were on a half board basis , we eat out regularly. 

This is not a child friendly hotel and I would not recommend it for any children.",2,2008,08,26
05,Not really a beach resort!,"After spending a week at the Tramontano in sorrento, which was supposed to be 4 star, but only delivered 3, we were looking forward to arriving at the supposedly 5 star Punta Molino.  Our initial impression was good - the staff are all very professional and efficient and the location is ideal - just a five minute stroll to the main street.

This hotel calls itself a beach resort - this is very debatable - with taht title you would expect a vast expanse of beach with water sports and facilities, when in fact all you get is a few rocky outcrops and man made beach areas which have loungers and umbellas regimentally positioned by two or three beach/pool attendants.  You do not have to fight each day to get the best postion as everyone is very civilised and once you have been 'allocated' your loungers they are yours for the duration of your stay as long as you take up residence before about 1pm - you can just pop down before breakfast and put a book or some other item of personal property on your chair if you do not intend using it until after lunch.  there were plenty of loungers to go around and there are no 'bad' positions.  We preferred the beach as the pool area  was small and rather lacking in atmosphere and only had about twenty loungers.

The evening meal was superb with a vast array of hors d'oeuvres which was buffet style.  You then chose a starter from achoice of five and also a main course from a choice of five - always one fish and one vegetarian.  this was all followed by a buffet table of desserts which were all rather similar, but there was a good choice of cheese and biscuits and fresh fruit.

The breakfast however was very disappointing.  There were only unappetising scrambled eggs and boiled eggs on offer, with an occasional sausage thrown in.  The main chioce was pastries and a good selection of breads and buns - although no toast or toaster!

There was a choice of tinned fruits and a bowl of fresh fruit salad.  The coffee was the best part of the breakfast.

We ate at the little cafe on the beach most days and it was delicious and reasonably priced, freshly made pasta dishes and salads.

We loved Ischia, but once you have walked up and down the main street afew times, there is very little to do.

The biggest disappointment was on our last day.  We were being collected from the hotel at 2.20pm so had a morning on the beach.  We had to give up our room at 12 noon and were told we could use the facilities in the 'Therme' (spa).  This consisted of a pathetic and rather grubby shower, where you had to run around to get properly wet.  when I asked for somewhere to plug in my hairdryer (lucky I had one because there was none offered by the spa) I was directed to the diabled toilet which had a mirror over the sink and a plug nearby.  this was also grubby and there was no air conditioning - supsequently I could have used another shower as I was hot and sticky by the time I had blown my hair and got dressed.   We even had to go to the pool/beach attendent to get towels!",3,2008,08,10
05,Ischian gem,"Spent a relaxing week here and found the hotel very acceptable although would question its 5* rating. Staff were extremely helpful and polite and could not do enough to help us. The real weakness was the beach which  was rather narrow and crowded. Sunbeds were available and could be reserved but the best ones seemed never to be available.......and rarely used!  Perhaps a hefty tip might have improved our prospects. Giant sized Russians obviously had the where with all to get the best! I wasn't going to agrue with that! The pool was OK just, but the thermal pool was fun 35 degrees mostly but 39 degrees on one day. Our superior villa were very good...tidy clean and extremely comfortable etc. Air con was fine. as was the small private garden. But no view of any merit. Food  was great. Excellent buffet starter, fish was fantastic. Avoid steaks which were rather fatty. Those with a hefty appertite will certainly not be diasappointed. Did not try the Gourmet Restaurant. Sadly breakfast came too soon after dinner but there a great selection to tempt all.
Hotel location is superb (for my wife) ... only a few minutes walk from an array of fashion shops. D & G, Prada, Armani, Hermes, Versace  but sadly no M&S or Matalan.
For those who want a quiet restful break and for whom good food is important with some designer shopping  thrown in then you can't go wrong with this hotel. But don't be dazzled by the 5*, more a good 4*.
",4,2007,07,31
05,HOT HOT HOT,"We had a short stay at the end of our Summer holiday. Staff was very polite. Hotel very old and a bit run down. Took a junior suite and the air conditioning totally inadequate. They were very sympathetic at the front desk but did nothing about it! $700 a night and we had to sweat between our sheets!

Pool was nice but the beach as most in Italy, was a joke. Walking distace to town, lots of shops and good food. Very busy in July and HOT!",1,2007,07,23
05,all it promised.,"This is a luxurious hotel that provides all that it claims and is quite charming in a glorious position yet near the shops and cafes of the Town. Perhaps unusually, the staff for the most part speak excellent English and German and also Italian. being in Italy.The whole ambience is easy going and the word ""luxury"" springs to mind again. For the most part the visitors will be mature in age and behaviour and you can rely on the fact there there will be little fowl language,raucous parties and most guests seem to be happy to drink out of a glass rather than the bottle.
",5,2006,10,06
05,Loved it,"We read some of the reviews before departing on our holiday and I must say we were a little concerned, but I'm glad to say it was unfounded. We also have been to many four and five star hotels  and OK if you compare it to some other five star hotels, lets say the Hermitage in Monte Carlo you are going to be very disappointed but there again your not paying Monte Carlo prices. All I can say is we had a fantastic time the staff are wonderful nothing was too much trouble, the room we had was comfortable,spotless and more spacious than expected. Its great at breakfast  you can go down in your robe, dinner was excellent plenty of choice and service was great.  We ate in the Le Gourmet one night which was very good and well worth doing. Both towns are within 5 to 10 minutes walk with great shopping and bars to watch the world go by.

All I can say is we had a fantastic time,  would we recommend it most definately, would we go back yes next week if it were possible.

05,"Great hotel, friendly staff, amazing island","This hotel is great, i had my 19th birthday there and didnt feel to young at all (they supprised me with a birthday cake after dinner on my b'day which was a nice touch), i was treated the same way as everyone else. I felt more out of place in the shopping area on the island being the only person with blonde hair and pasty white skin lol then being to young. 
Me and my partner stayed in one of there suites, we had a bedroom and seprate lounge both with 2 armchairs and flat screen tvs, we also had 2 bathrooms, one with shower and one with a whirlpool bath. On arrival the staff were extreamly friendly and spoke ok english as we dont know any italian at all. Room was imaculate cleaners came in twice everyday, once to clean and once to lay the beds in the evening and leave us bedtime treats.
They have 2 pools both clean, one with hot thermal water. There beauty farm is quite small but there treatments are to die for (the only downside is that the beauty theraphist didn't speak to much english so we found it slightly hard to comunicate at times) 
The food was also to die for, a buffet starter of a wide range of meats, vegitables, oils and dressings, mini pizzas, fish rolls ect... chioce starter and main course, and a buffet desert of at least 20 fresh cakes, ice cream, crackers and cheeses ect.... on our final night they layed on a spectacular buffet and brought out a pig, veal, turkey, fish, volancano ect.. all alight on fire, and the dessert was also full of masterpieces , carved flower water melons ect...
There piano bar is quiet most nights, but the singers are good and the floor is bigger enough to do a waltz and a cha cha cha on lol.
All staff were very very very friendly and yea we were the youngest couple there but there were a few familys with children there also.
The island is great for shopping, ""SALDI"" means sale lol although they dont mark there items down like selfridges over here do, i was buying things and getting to the counter to realise there was up to 60 %off some of the items which was great when i was about to pay  800 euros for a satin suit, and it was 300 and somthing lol. Gucci is no cheaper over there though even thou i thought it might be because its italian.
Ischia castle is a must see (10 mins walk from the hotel) , they have a lovely cafe at the top as well which is nice to eat at. The local pottery is really cheap, we brought some lovely hand painted dinner plates and its nice because you can see them making them. We also went to the st maria festival on the 26th of july which was lovely all of the island got together around the castle to celibrate and it was nice to see there local culturebeing displayed there.
Going back to the hotel, there beach is small but theres public beaches all around there island what are clean. I have visited lots of hotels and places around the world and i did really enjoy it here very relaxing!. The hotel is 5 star exculsive in its own means, its on a small quiet island which isnt the richest place around, if the hotel was in london then it probably would only be 4-5 stars, but its probably the most exclusive place on the island.
Would indeed go again.
please veiw some of my pics of the castle and hotel (i am not a professional photographer and i have not altered any of the pics)
",5,2006,03,17
05,Quality hotel recommended for a relaxing stay,"I too had misgivings about staying at the hotel after reading some of the reveiews from guests staying earlier in the year, however I can say that it was one of the best places I've stayed at in Italy (and that includes around 10 hotels including 4 that were 4 or 5 star establishments - only Palazzo Sasso in Ravello beats it and thats about twice the price!). 

The previous reviews are in my opinion a bit misleading on a couple of matters - firstly re the hotel having 20 feet of beach. This is true but it also has an area next to it with about 20 sunbeds, and additional sunbathing pier with another 20 or so sun loungers, and a further sandy area to the right set above a different section of the shore with around 30 sunloungers / umbrellas which also gives access to a small (public) cove which was usually quiet and great for swimming. This is more space that most hotels in the area have and the sunbeds can be booked in advance (no need for the early morning towel race!). Even at peak times there was always space to sunbathe.

Re watersports being on the other side of the island this is true - however the island in question is the big lump of rock connected to ischia ponte on which the Castello de aragon stands.  On the other side of the causeway - an easy 20 min stroll from the hotel - is a place that rents out motorboats and kayaks.

Re age group agree that most are on the declining side of 50 but there were quite a few (around 30%) that were I would guess under 40 

As far as the waiters are concerned they were some of the best I have encountered in any hotel, with just the right blend of friendliness and professionalism. 

The food was as good as any other similarly starred hotels with 4 choices per course and plenty of variety each day, the hors d'ouvres that could be had before the meal were similarly good (Palazzo Sasso may have been better but that was michelin starred!) 

As far as our room was concerned we had one in the main part of the hotel which was very well furnsihed always kept clean and of a good size. The public areas of the hotel were impressive with antique furniture and paintings in abundance. Finally the hotel arranged all our transfers which ran faultlessly and also booked excursions etc as required. 

All in all an excellent stay at a well run and upmarket hotel

05,"A lively, friendly hotel","Having read some of the Trip Advisor reviews about this hotel (after booking), we were a little apprehensive about what to expect. But the hotel is much better than its critics allow. The staff were wonderful, and made allowances for an unexpectedly late arrival, providing a late dinner. Although the rooms are not huge, they are tastefully decorated and well equipped; we had a nice balcony too. The four-course table d'hote lunch - which we often opted for from our half-board deal - with several barbeque choices and an excellent starter buffet - was good; dinner was sometimes not as good as might be, but was a lot better than many other half-board offers. The outdoors bar, with nightly singers, was better than many similar offerings - there were 100 people there some nights, plenty of them dancing. The Terme was limited - especially with great alternatives a bus ride away; and the beach area is small, though staffed by helpful 'beach masters.' But if you want a hotel close to the shops and restaurants of both Ischia Porto and Ischia Ponte (do try Catriona's restaurant there!), but offering a bit of peace and quiet, this is a good choice.

05,quiet location,"The location is great-away from the noise.The facilities are very good particularly the massage spar.\the ""private beach"" is a bit of a joke . It is sandy but only about 20 feet wide! The food was a let down. The main course was very limited,not always well cooked and often served cold by the time it rached the table.The hotel was very clean and the rooms were spotless albeit on the small side. The extra charges for a sea view were not worth while.We had a pleasant holiday and the island itself is well worth visiting.For music buffs the William Walton concert is a must.

05,Not a leading hotel of the world!,"We stayed at the Punta Molina for the last week of our Honeymoon in August 04. After staying in a fantastic 5 star hotel in Sorrento we were looking forward to an even better experience at this hotel. We were so disappointed. On arrival the staff watched us struggle into reception with all our bags and didn't help us. We were then shown to a rather small, dark, totally unimpressive room with a tiny bathroom. We found the pool area shabby and cramped. Some of the tiles around the pool were cracked and the steps into the pool were hanging off the wall! Not what you'd expect from a five star hotel. 
The so called beach was a strip of sand with people packed like sardines- awful!
Most of the staff were rude and definately favoured Italian guests. We felt totally out of place. As one of the other reviews points out - alot of the guests were older.
The food was bland and tasteless. 
After two nights at this hotel we felt totally depressed. We decided to leave and couldn't get any money refunded. We ended up paying out more money and went back to Sorrento to a four star hotel. The four star hotel (the bristol) made the Punta Molina look like a three star- which in my opinion it is! I don't know how this hotel was ever rated as a leading hotel of the world. Don't pay five star money if you are expecting a real five star hotel. You won't get it at the Punta Molino.
",2,2004,11,04
05,Don't Stay Here if You Are Under 50!,"We stayed here for a few days on our Honeymoon last June.  The idea was to live it up in Capri, Positano, and Ravello first, and then stay somewhere cheaper, more relaxed on the water and enjoy some beach time and water sports.

This hotel should not be included in ""The Leading Hotels of the World"" group!  There is nothing ""leading"" about this hotel.  The beach is TINY and therefore crowded.  I would actually hardly call it a beach -- it is a ""swimming area"".  The pool is very small and not impressive.

Everyone at this hotel is OLD!  We made friends with the 1 other young couple we met there.  We felt as if we were in a geriatric institution.  Which brings me to the food -- overcooked and bland.  We only ate there b/c our package included meals -- but by the end we paid on our own outside instead.

The brochure shows that the hotel provides or is close to water sports -- like windsurfing, kayaking, etc.  There are none of these amenities on the resort.  When I confronted the hotel on the brochure of water sports nearby - they indicated that they were nearby --- on the other side of the island!

You are close (walking distance) to the main town in Ischia - so if that is most important, you may consider this area - but I would look for another property.

Where to stay: We enjoyed the area around St. Angelo.  There were many quiet, nice hotels, good relaxed dining options, views, and close to beaches and boat and paddleboat rentals.  Our favorite activitiy on Ischia was renting a boat (which we took over to Capri again) and renting a paddleboat with a ""deck"" to lay out on and jump out into the water --- we could sit on the paddleboat all day.

05,superb,We stayed at the Punta Molino in June 2003 for 2 weeks. The hotel is wonderful and the staff can't do enough for you. The food is superb and the location is stunning. A visit to La Mortella gardens on the island is a must especially the weekend concerts.,5,2003,09,25
05,perfect honeymoon,"The Punta Molino is in the perfect place in Ischia. Close enough to the Port and Ponte for shopping and resturants yet noice and secluded. Our room had a great view. It was nice although it could maybe do with a little updating. The service was superb. The staff are all really friendly. The food is simply incredible. Everything is so fresh and there is just so much of it. We would not hesitate to go back, it just had a really nice feel about it.",5,2003,07,01
05,Easy to see the negative if you are negative,"We have been several times, over the years, guests of the structure. Easy to see the negative if you are negative, especially then if you are in the industry. This experience we lived not by technicians specialized in tourist accommodation facilities, but by guests who appreciate what is good on offer. The location is ideal for everything, the courteous and helpful staff, the right breakfast. The care that General Manager Antonio Buono took for us was attentive and professional (congratulations). Waiting for our next moment of relaxation, we need a physiological ""restyle"" of the entire structure, which has enormous potential. Thank you for your pleasant stay",4,2024,09,19
05,"Beautiful location, with thermal pools and not, private beach.","Beautiful location, with thermal pools and not, private beach. Ischia Porto is within walking distance with a beautiful walk through the pedestrian center a few dozen meters from the property.
Terrace for breakfast and panoramic restaurant.
Very good breakfast. Normal dinner.
Accurate services and kindness.
Very nice room, we had an upgrade to the junior suite (we had booked a superior sea view).
Some details a bit dated but elegance and comfort are not lacking.",4,2024,08,19
05,Relax!!!,"Fantastic property in the center of Ischia with great services offered such as transfer to / from port. Friendly, friendly and always helpful staff. Special credit goes to Conny, the lifeguards and the girls at the beach bar. Thank you for giving us days of pure relaxation! Straconsigliato .. shame having to leave. We will be back soon.",5,2024,08,13
05,Everything you need in a hotel,"Impeccable attention from all the service, special mention for Conny who helped us, advised and guided us in our stay always with a smile. Super full breakfast and for lunch and dinner the restaurant is impressive. An experience to repeat without a doubt.",5,2024,08,03
05,I lost some stars,"We arrived in 3 bed & breakfasts, with accommodation in junior suites. The accommodation was not exactly 5 stars: sink that does not flush well, toilet with the drain that enchants, spotlights with rusty spotlights, toilet with an obvious vertical break, the shower adapted in the tub with a copious drop of water with each shower. The rest of the room unclean but spacious. Clear signs of superficial painting, even a nail of a painting painted white and left there without a painting.
The common areas without air conditioning, the lights that come on not automatically in the stairs, where there are lamp holders without bulbs.
Beautiful but dirty pools to die for especially the cold, green one on the walls, bordering on decency.
Other customers complained about dinner and lunch, we fortunately went out. 
Breakfast is for us the only strength along with the reception. Only today we used the snack services, well 48 euros for 1 regular toast, 2 portions of chips and 2 bottles of water. There is the price but the quality / price ratio is unfortunately very low in our opinion.
We hope the new property will do this miracle because the property is in an enviable place.",2,2024,07,14
05,A structure with great potential,"The facility certainly needs renovation , although there are many elements that can remain . A lovely and strategic location. The absolute strength is the very professional staff and makes up for the shortcomings of the structure. To be redone without a shadow of a doubt the roofs at the restaurant , impossible , the swimming pools ( they have not seen maintenance for years and of course the rooms . The sea view of the first floor is a view of a huge and poorly maintained roof. I would recommend a roof garden. 
In short, a Ferrari with deflated tires. 
I hope that the new property will enhance this beautiful hotel and preserve this great capital of employees of great professional quality.",3,2024,07,13
05,Relaxation and courtesy,"We had a good time and ,all in all, rather than go into detail if it respects the canons of a 5 star, I would say that it has a good value for money.
A beautiful stretch of sea, three swimming pools, attention from all the services but above all one thing that left me very positively impressed, having had during the stay an episode of cold flu, I was made available to a very good and courteous doctor.
There are places , but there are not many, where the hotel activity is first and foremost hospitality , Punta Molino, is one of them.",5,2024,07,12
05,A Lighthouse of Hospitality and Courtesy in Ischia,"Punta Molino is always a certainty.
Courtesy, kindness of the staff and everything organized to make you feel good and pampered.
Extraordinary beachfront location.
Beautiful pools and one of the most beautiful beaches in Ischia.
Great breakfast and always high quality raw materials.
Lunga vita a Punta Molino!",5,2024,07,01
05,A pleasant stay.,"Property in a magnificent location, overlooking the Aragonese Castle of Ischia. Retro style (the building is from 1968) but kept overall well. Hearty breakfast. There are 3 swimming pools plus a private beach, as well as a SPA. Commendable staff: you sense the desire to ""do well"". They solved with class a problem with the laundry (charge not included in the final bill and apology cards with gratuity). Recommended for a quiet and relaxing stay.",4,2024,06,24
05,5 stars on paper but not in reality,"The location is excellent with a view of the sea and the Aragonese castle. Despite being in a very quiet area, in a few minutes on foot you can reach Ischia Ponte or Ischia City. The external area of the structure is beautiful although, in my opinion, it should be looked after with more attention. 3 stars for the rooms that are absolutely not at the level of a 5 star, old with uncomfortable beds and light coming through the windows in the morning. The spa and gym area should also absolutely be renovated. Very good and plentiful breakfast. We did not use the restaurant/bar service due to the prices, which were decidedly too high. Another flaw is the port-hotel shuttle service which is only active from 9am to 5pm...and who arrives later or has to leave early?!
In short...5 stars on paper but not in reality.",3,2024,06,18
05,Relaxing weekend,"The hotel is located in Ischia Porto in a quiet area and in any case 5 minutes from the main street (walking and walking).
Very comfortable private beach. Very beautiful, well-kept and well-kept (I think it is one of the few structures in Ischia to have a private beach, inside the structure, without boats, dinghies, etc. moored).
The swimming pools (both indoor and outdoor) are well maintained.
The hotel is a little old (they report that restoration work is planned by the new ownership next year) but it is very well kept with attentive, polite, kind and very professional staff.
The staff itself is the strong point of this hotel, starting from the cleaner up to the manager (kind, polite person, always present and attentive to every need and request of the guests).
The spa is very comfortable with excellent staff. Good at massages.
Huge park with a beautiful garden that is always well cared for.
Excellent morning breakfast (with amazing Ischia croissants) and good dinner (with dishes prepared to perfection).
The hotel's shuttle service for pick-up and drop-off to the port (included in the room price) is convenient and intelligent.
We spent a wonderful weekend and the following one, precisely because we had such a good time, we returned!
Good value for money.
I highly recommend it.",5,2024,06,09

The location is also not to be underestimated given the proximity to the center",4,2024,03,19
05,Scenic hotel,"Scenic hotel by the sea, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, clean, a little tired. Friendly and professional staff with the exception of the little blonde with a ponytail at the reception who only said hello if she had to. Turndown required with a sweet on the pillow, perhaps better a flower petal. There is no coffee kit in the room and 1 bottle of water per night
The swimming pools are beautiful and the entrances are convenient
Good food and breakfast",5,2023,09,23
05,Excellent location and private beach,"Beautiful hotel in its spaces, 5-star hospitality, rooms and everything else in classic and Vietri style, a little dated but well kept except for a few small repairs to be made. Its strong point is the position and the private beach, I recommend it but a little dear if you prefer a new and modern style go elsewhere, however it respects the island style very much",4,2023,08,26
05,"A high five...""cuddles""...","Rather than five stars, it would be appropriate to talk about five cuddles: this obsolete parameter should be replaced by this more current and realistic indicator. Well yes, in this hotel everything is based on offering the guest a pampering holiday!! Fascinating structure, with a sixties/seventies flavour, very central and equipped with a private beach facing the Aragonese castle, it also has indoor and outdoor thermal pools in which you can spend the last hours of the day in total relaxation as you come up from the beach. Beautiful and quality breakfast with lots and lots of staff at your disposal and, added value, an adjacent restaurant overlooking the sea, the historic ""rangio fellone"", a real roundabout on the sea where you will find, for those who want it, evening entertainment with music soft and a classy piano bar.
Highly recommended for a top holiday!!",5,2023,08,20
05,A small paradise in the heart of Ischia Porto,"Definitely one of the best hotels on the island, in the center of Ischia port but in a very quiet street on the sea. Very kind and highly trained staff, ready to satisfy every customer request with a smile. Excellent cuisine, both for breakfast and lunch/dinner, wide choice of products and exceptional quality. The property offers various beaches and 3 swimming pools (2 thermal, one of which is indoor). Perfect cleanliness both in the common areas and in the rooms. Another little gem is the care of the gardens, truly breathtaking! I will definitely go back.

05,When what you write doesn't correspond to the truth!,"For several years now, in August, I have been spending my holidays at the Punta Molino hotel and I am sorry to read such harsh reviews, considering that right now I am inside the hotel and I can assure you that Punta Molino offers much more than what is written: the food is good both in the buffet and in the menu formula, the staff is professionally valid and in any case very polite in following the customer in the best possible way. Of course, everything can be improved, and it must be, but I absolutely don't agree with what was stated in the two previous comments which seem more like an attempt to take revenge rather than write the truth in a review! Now, it must be said that the hotel must be renovated in all its lines of service offering, starting from the structure, modernizing some rooms, making the hotel more comfortable etc.. to offer its customers an always more attentive to their needs. I consider myself a ""loyal"" customer of this splendid structure, whose location is among the best in Ischia but I am also aware that the hotel is facing a management change whose best results will only be seen in some time, perhaps by adopting a more appropriate and fair pricing policy that we all hope for. A loyal customer",4,2023,08,19

05,A Disgust,"It was a 5 star, with the new management it doesn't deserve 1…. Terrible catering from breakfast to lunch and dinner, very slow service, poor variety of food, awkward staff, if it weren't for the few who still work there from the old ownership, it would be a disaster.

05,Hotel datato ma stile e charme affascinano ancora,"Hotel datata ma molto ben mantenuto. Arredi stile e charme conservati con cura. Personale eccellente. Professionale, cortese, gentile, prodigo di cure ed attenzioni per gli ospiti. Il tutto con classe e discrezione. Abbiamo cenato due volte con alternanza di chef. Entrambi bravissimi. Cene eccellenti. Dovrei nominare tutti quelli che si sono presi cura di noi ma sono stati in tanti (tra loro anche il tecnico-mago dei televisori che ci ha permesso di vedere la partita del Napoli e l'autista Ciro) per cui mi limiterò a citare (per tutti) i rispettivi ""chief"": Elena per la reservation & booking, Ciro per la Concierge e Peppe per la ristorazione. L'Hotel è in posizione strategica. Centrale (5 minuti a piedi sia per il centro di Ischia Porto che per Ponte) ma in zona tranquillissima. Spiaggia privata ed attrezzata il che lo rende ancora più unico ad Ischia dove credo siano pochissimi se non rari gli alberghi con spiaggia privata. Ovviamente non tutto è perfetto. Unica mia lamentela, no pardon!...rilievo (perchè di lamentele in senso tecnico non può parlarsi), riguarda la camera che più di ogni altro rispecchia l'epoca di realizzazione dell'hotel (qualche metro quadro in più e quindi un guardaroba più ampio sarebbero stati ben graditi però il letto è molto comodo e la pulizia quasi maniacale) ed il bagno dove mancavano (almeno nel mio) il portasapone sul lavabo ed i ganci per appendere asciugamani/accappatoi. Altri rilievi: il bicchiere di carta come contenitore di dentifricio e spazzolini non è ammissibile in un Hotel 5 stelle ed è da migliorare l'aerazione. 
I miei amici ed io abbiamo deciso che ogni qualvolta vorremo trascorrere un periodo di vacanza ad Ischia sceglieremo convintamente il Punta Molino.",5,2023,04,16

È dotato di diverse piscine ma quella che più ci è piaciuta è stata quella termale, piacevole stare a bordo piscina e guardare il castello. Il ristorante dell’albergo è ottimo, abbiamo mangiato benissimo, con cibo freschissimo e di qualità.  Infinito è il buffet colazione, con larga possibilità di scelta tra dolce e salato, ma anche un menu a la carte.

Salvatore, il personale della reception estremamente gentile e disponibile e per finire anche i bagnini sempre efficienti. L’albergo è in una posizione perfetta perché si affaccia con la sua spiaggia privata su un tratto di mare molto bello e molto panoramico. È estremamente comodo perché è posizionato al centro tra Ischia porto e Ischia ponte che sono facilmente raggiungibili a piedi e questo è fondamentale specie per chi come noi ha soggiornato con figlie ventenni che potevano tranquillamente muoversi da sole. Colazione abbondante servita su una bellissima terrazza, camere spaziose e pulite. Consigliatissimo, grazie torneremo sicuramente.

05,Colazione scarsa,"Circa 20 giorni fa ho terminato la mia esperienza al Punta Molino resort. L’ho apprezzato molto come hotel, infatti questa è la seconda volta che ci ritorno. Mi piace molto che l’hotel è situato di fronte al mare ed è a pochi passi dal centro. Le camere sono confortevoli, spaziose e molto pulite! La biancheria è sempre profumata e  candida .. il personale è molto disponibile e accogliente in tutte le richieste che vengono fatte! Spiaggia fronte hotel comodissima, anche i bagnini simpaticissimi e attenti a soddisfare le richieste dei clienti. Piscine spettacolari come la S.p.a . La sera un rilassante piano bar con musica dal vivo. L’unica pecca di questo l’hotel è la prima colazione.  Purtroppo la colazione che propone l’hotel nonostante sia un cinque stelle, è molto scarsa, non è una colazione internazionale,la paragono a quella di un tre stelle!!! Non c’è scelta e mancano molte cose!!! Spero che rivedono questo servizio negativo prendendo dei provvedimenti per migliorare questa pecca datosi che la prima colazione è il momento più bello di una vacanza … un caro saluto a tutto lo staff!!!",4,2022,08,09

A cominciare dall'arrivo: sul sito dicevano che c'era la navetta gratuita dal porto all'hotel , invece appena arrivati scopriamo che il  servizio navetta finiva alle 17.00, assurdo! La stanza purtroppo con le finestre senza tapparelle, al mattino non si riusciva a dormire per la luce,  le tende non erano oscuranti, il materasso scomodo molto duro, la cassaforte rotta. A colazione tutta roba comprata al supermercato :crostate sintetiche, succhi di frutta finti. La spremuta d'arancia se volevi quella vera dovevi farla fare al bar ma come extra. Nonostante l'emergenza covid sia finita bisognava chiedere al personale ogni cosa. A me piace scegliere da sola  e prendere tutto quello che voglio ... questo è il bello della colazione ! Posizione però bella a pochi passi dal mare. Peccato che la spiaggia privata chiudesse alle 19.00., l'orario più bello per stare in spiaggia e fare un ultimo bagno.",1,2022,08,06
05,Campione di accoglienza,"Torniamo dopo due anni di assenza causa Covid in quest’albergo che si conferma in una posizione unica a Ischia porto nonché campione di accoglienza per l’estrema cordialità di tutto il personale
La certezza è che qualsiasi vostro desiderio cercheranno di esaudirlo al meglio
Hanno iniziato anche a ristrutturare alcune camere con ottimi risultati di confort.
Non arrivo a cinque stelle solo per la vetustà di alcuni arredi (ad esempio i lettini in piscina) che per alcuni passi indietro nel buffet delle colazioni e degli antipasti rispetto ad un sontuoso passato
Nota di merito per tutto il personale e per tutti citiamo solo il direttore Fulvio Gaglione e il manager food and beverage Ciro Iacono.

Abbiamo sempre mangiato benissimo, sia a cena, con il menù ogni sera diverso, che a pranzo con la possibilità di scegliere se mangiare in terrazza o sotto l'ombrellone, e a  colazione eravamo accontenti tutti perché è ricchissima. Abbiamo avuto una bellissima camera con vista strepitosa sul mare e il Castello Aragonese, molto spaziosa e soprattutto pulita. Insomma un posto in cui sicuro tornero'.",5,2022,07,26

05,Da rivoluzionare,"Sono stato in questo hotel 3 notti con la mia famiglia. Dispiace fare una recensione parzialmente negativa, per chi vi lavora, il personale infatti è molto accogliente e si vede che ci tiene e fa di tutto per soddisfare i clienti. Purtroppo però non basta, l’albergo è totalmente da ristrutturare, è rimasto fermo ad almeno 40 anni fa. Camere vecchie, arredamento molto datato e in alcuni casi rovinato, vasca con doccia anni 80. Anche gli spazi comuni necessitano di ristrutturazione, le “guide”(tappeti) nei corridoi in alcune parti macchiate, che denotano la trascuratezza in cui versa tutto l’albergo. 
Purtroppo non posso neanche parlare troppo bene neanche del ristorante, dignitoso ma anche lì, fermi agli anni 80, zero innovazione in cucina. Parliamo di un cinque stelle, ci vuole più quantità e qualità sia nel buffet degli antipasti che in quello della colazione. 
Do 3 punti di incoraggiamento, ma ora come ora di certo non tornerei.",3,2022,07,22
05,Una settimana di benessere,"Una oasi di tranquillità ad un passo da vie commerciali tra il porto e il castello.

Servizio impeccabile, piscine calde, fredde spiaggia e mare circondati dal verde e da numerosi ristoranti.

Un campo base perfetto anche per scoprire tutte le splendide località dell'isola. 

Un ringraziamento a tutto lo staff",5,2022,06,25
05,Vacanza add Ischia hotel Punta Molino,"Sono stata in questa struttura 4 giorni.Posto bellissimo, 3 piscine  di cui 2 termali  accesso alla spiaggia di fronte all'hotel. Devo dire che l'hotel necessita di parecchi lavori di Ammodernamento,  tipo aria condizionata rumorosissimA, impossibile tenerla accesa la notte, le chiavi sono ancora quelle con la nappa, pure vecchia e sudicia, personale ai piani che senza suonare si infilano in camera, per non parlare poca attenzione alle chiavi..hanno dato la miA chiave ad una che la aveva chiesta!! Menù conconcordato 50 €a pasto, ma poiché ho preso solo 3 cose... del menu me lo hanno conteggiato  facendomi spendere di più.Mi hanno detto che lo dovevo prendere e magari....non mangiarlo!!non mi piace sprecare il cibo! Cucina...per i miei gusti ..tanta roba..ma un pesce intero non lo hanno, visto che si fregiano di 5 stelle... tutto molto lavorato..camera venduta  per lato giardino...su una siepe....la toccavo con le mani.....molte cose da rivedere a mio avviso..... non ci tornerò.

A presto",5,2021,09,22
05,Vista mozzafiato ,"L'hotel ha una posizione invidiabile, a pochi metri  dal mare con una spiaggia privata e ben servita.  Le camere sono pulite e il personale molto gentile.  Preziose le piscine, soprattutto  quelle termali. Buona la spa interna. Si potrebbero curare un po' di più alcuni particolari,  ma L'hotel è eccellente. ",4,2021,09,13
05,Meraviglioso e Relax,"Il Punta Molino si trova in una posizione strategica sia vicino al centro  di Ischia che vicino a Ischia Ponte. Incantevole è la posizione con panorama fantastico sul Mare.
Dispone di tre piscine molto belle di cui una al coperto. Stupenda, incantevole è la spiaggia con personale gentilissimo e sempre attento a qualsiasi richiesta.
Gentilissimi e cordiali alla reception, siamo stati accolti con la massima cortesia e premura. Tutto lo staff è sempre attento ad ogni esigenza.
Camera bellissima e profumata, nell'intera struttura si sente un profumo che conferisce una sensazione di Benessere e Relax.
Grazie.
Sicuramente una delle Migliori strutture di Ischia.",5,2021,09,04
05,Peccato che il minimo sia 1 stella....VERGOGNA!!!!,"Abbiamo prenotato questa struttura ad inizio Maggio per un soggiorno dal 13 al 23 Agosto optando per una camera matrimoniale vista mare con colazione ad €430.00 al giorno essendo costretti a cambiarla durante il soggiorno per una mancanza di disponibilità.

Purtroppo una volta arrivati in struttura ci viene assegnata una camera che neanche il peggiore dei TUGURI poteva essere, polvere ovunque e messa veramente male.

Nei corridoi delle camere aria condizionata inesistente considerando il periodo l'hotel era una sauna naturale.

Il nostro primo giorno di vacanza sarebbe dovuto essere a 5* come la struttura prometteva ma arrivati in spiaggia alle ore 09:00 tutti i lettini erano coperti da teli che i clienti lasciavano il giorno prima per acaparrarsi i posti migliori senza dare la possibilità a chi arrivasse in spiaggia di sedersi dove preferiva.

Dopo esserci lamentati con i bagnini che avrebbero dovuto dare la priorità a chi arrivasse prima in spiaggia ci viene detto di rivolgerci alla direzione.

Senza voglia e gia sudati alle 09:30 ci apprestiamo a parlare con il direttore che con la sua arroganza e poca professionalità ci dice che è tutto normale e che probabilmente i teli erano stati lasciati li poco prima che arrivassimo noi (cosa veramente impossibile).

Credendo a cio che ci veniva detto ci accontentiamo e prendiamo posto dove era libero promettendoci che il giorno dopo saremmo scesi prima per trovare una migliore collocazione.

Giorno 2    15/08/2021

Il nostro Ferragosto da incubo inizia alle ore 8:30 già in spiaggia stessa situazione i teli del giorno prima erano collocati nello stesso posto e per fare un bagno dovevamo fare un vero e proprio tour de force fatto di scalini e dribbling tra lettini e ombrelloni.

Infuriati torniamo in direzione ma purtroppo stessa situazione del giorno prima e onestamente da una struttura del genere non ci saremmo mai aspettati che i bagnini coccolavano i clienti che gli lasciavano regalini in € per riservargli i posti più vicini al mare...

Il tutto è veramente VERGOGNOSO pagando €430 al giorno non crediamo sia giusto dover lasciare regalini in giro per avere un trattamento.

15 Agosto ore 11:00 lasciamo la struttura per tornare a casa...meglio non continuare quella che non può assolutamente essere definita una VACANZA

Ho 73 ANNI ed ho girato il mondo non vi consiglio di soggiornare in questa struttura che di 5* non ha praticamente nulla.....Struttura che vuole distinguersi dalle altre ma mette SOLO a disagio e non poco chi per un anno intero fa sacrifici per godersi una meritata Vacanza.

Come consiglio non pagate mai la vacanza per intero ma saldate sempre all'arrivo in struttura potrebbero farvi trovare delle cattive sorprese proprio come la nostra.

Non ci ritorneremo mai piu.....",1,2021,09,01
05,Finale Viaggio di Nozze Stellare,"Per il finale del viaggio di nozze sono stato al Grand Hotel Punta Molino e posso dire :Location spettacolare,camere, ristorante, terme, staff,tutto curato nei minimi particolari, ho conosciuto anche il Direttore il dott.Gaglione; un professionista eccellente e di una disponibilità unica, ed ecco la spiegazione di tanta eccellenza.
Consigliatissimo e ritornerò sicuramente!!",5,2021,08,28
05,Breve vacanza relax,"Il Punta Molino gode di una posizione di eccellenza, a due passi dal piu caotico centro, sul mare con le proprie spiagge attrezzate ed un panorama mozzafiato. Per questo, accompagnata dalla gentilezza di (quasi) tutto lo staff, per me resta una delle eccellenze si Ischia, ma non senza qualche pecca. Vi sono elementi che non sono ammissibili in un 5*. La rubinetteria vetusta, impossibile da regolare, la vasca da bagno con anta basculante per la doccia, elementi di arredo risalenti probabilmente agli anni 70, bocchette dell’aria condizionata sporche. Questi elementi, a mio avviso, fanno perdere tanto ad una struttura che altrimenti sarebbe il top. Peraltro la concorrenza in zona, da questo punto di vista, mantiene standard elevatissimi. Spero sia spunto di riflessione. 
In ultimo è inammissibile il costo di 5€ per una bottiglia d’acqua che vien portata al tavolo chiusa da un banale tappo in plastica di quelli da birra o addirittura senza.
La cucina è ottima, varia, con prezzi abbastanza adeguati al livello proposto.",4,2021,08,28
05,Ottima esperienza,"Abbiamo trascorso tre giorni in questa struttura, beneficiando di tutti i servizi dell’albergo. 
Il servizio é impeccabile, ottima qualità del cibo e il personale é professionale e con tanto calore mediterraneo! 

Davvero un’ottima esperienza!",5,2021,08,18
05,"Bello, accogliente e ospitale","Ho soggiornato al Punta Molino per tre notti insieme a mia moglie. Hotel lussuoso soprattutto negli ambienti comuni interni, molto ben curati e raffinati. L’esterno paga un pochino l’età e soprattutto il fatto di essere sul mare, sarebbe impossibile avere una vista e una posizione così senza pagare dazio. Camera grande con doppio finestra sia  sul mare che sul Castello Aragonese. Personale gentilissimo e sempre discreto, pronto a venire incontro a ogni nostra richiesta o esigenza. Piccole ma riservate le spiagge private, un paradiso per chi, come noi, aveva soprattutto bisogno di relax. Ristorante all’altezza delle aspettative così come le prime colazioni. Sicuramente da consigliare.",5,2021,07,01

05,Confort e accoglienza sopra le aspettative,"Mi sono recata ad Ischia con un'amica x le cure termali ed una breve vacanza. La scelta del punta molino ha soddisfatto pienamente le aspettative.

Grazie per la cordialità di tutto lo staff.",5,2020,09,14
05,Herausragendes Personal,"Wir waren eine Woche im September im Punta Molina und hatten eine wirklich sehr erholsame Zeit. Das Personal ist unglaublich freundlich und aufmerksam. Das Essen schmeckt toll, sowohl das Frühstück als auch das Abendessen und man sitzt herrlich auf der Terrasse. Der Strandabschnitt ist ebenso wunderbar ruhig und mit schöner Aussicht. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon und Ausblick auf das Castello, worin wir uns sehr wohlgefühlt haben. Das Mobiliar ist zwar ziemlich abgewohnt, dies wird allerdings durch die vielen positiven Dinge wieder wett gemacht. Wir kommen bestimmt wieder!",5,2020,09,09
05,Tutto perfetto,"Camere ampie comode e pulite. Vista mare mozzafiato. Spiaggia privata e posizione strategica per arrivare in centro in pochi minuti a piedi. Colazione superlativa, con tutto quello che si può desiderare, sia dolce che salato. Insomma tutto perfetto!",5,2020,08,29
05,Mah,"Niente a che vedere con le foto e i servizi illustrati sul sito. Certo, parco, giardino e posizione molto belli, ma tutto il resto…
Camere datate, necessitanti di una ristrutturazione come tutto l’hotel. Addirittura per l’apertura della porta della camera si usa la chiave, con un portachiavi che pesa mezzo chilo e, per averne una copia, ho dovuto attendere diverso tempo. 
Avevo richiesto camera con balcone vista mare, quando sono arrivata però mi sono trovata una camera al primo piano che aveva vista sul patio delle colazioni (coperto da un enorme tendone). Il mare, insomma, lo si vedeva col binocolo.
Nel bagno - fornito solo di una scomoda vasca - non era possibile trovare una giusta temperatura dell’acqua, o bollente o gelata. Inoltre era munito di un asciugacapelli datato che aveva la potenza di un soffio d’aria, quindi praticamente inutile per una donna. Per ultimo, ma non per importanza, il set di cortesia era per una persona, quando ce ne sarebbero dovuti essere tre, dati gli ospiti della camera. 
Il WI-FI praticamente inesistente in tutta a struttura e stesso discorso per internet. Per effettuare una chiamata devi vagare per l’hotel in cerca di un punto in cui prenda meno peggio degli altri costringendoti magari a far sentire le tue chiamate ad altre persone. 
Le piscine belle ma anche lì tutto da sostituire: l’intonaco era fatiscente e cadeva inevitabilmente in piscina, gli idromassaggi tutti da sostituire in quanto ne funzionava solo uno, peraltro nella piscina con l’acqua gelida, sempre vuota per ovvi motivi. 
Ai lettini, in legno, erano state tolte le ruote ed era impossibile muoverli, Il bagnino delle piscine invece era presente un giorno si e tre no. 
Le spiagge belle, bellissime. Mi ero accertata preventivamente che l’hotel avesse la spiaggia privata e almeno così è stato. Peccato che di privato avesse poco e nulla. 
La spiaggia di destra, confinante con una spiaggia libera, veniva invasa da decine di bambini che schiamazzavano provenienti dalla stessa e che si lanciavano dagli scogli. 
Quella di sinistra di sinistra - sempre del Punta Molino - confinava con altra spiaggia privata e non si capisce bene il motivo ma veniva invasa anche lei da persone della spiaggia confinante, che venivano a fare il bagno nella spiaggia dell’hotel. 
La terza spiaggia, centrale, molto piccola (8 lettini) bellissima ma inaccessibile, dato che era perennemente prenotata. Sono stata avvisata soltanto dopo una settimana che i posti in spiaggia dovevano essere prenotati e sarebbero rimasti gli stessi per tutto il soggiorno… peccato che a noi si erano dimenticati di dirlo (nonostante la mancia ai bagnini) e così vagavamo da una spiaggia all’altra come anime in pena, optando poi per la piscina vista l’invasione esterna delle spiagge.
Avevamo scelto la formula pernottamento/prima colazione per poter essere liberi di provare diversi ristoranti vicini all’hotel, data la posizione strategica. Al ristorante dell’albergo il menù è senza prezzi. Una “zingara”, un semplice panino, ci è costata € 18 e l’abbiamo scoperto solo in seguito, al bar della spiaggia accanto abbiamo pagato lo stesso panino, acqua, caffè e gelato       € 10, oltretutto.  
All’arrivo ci è stato dato un coupon per un massaggio gratuito, peccato che quando è arrivato il momento di utilizzarlo ci è stato detto che poteva essere utilizzato solo in determinati orari. Quindi, omaggio non utilizzato.

Questo albergo di 5 stelle non ha nulla, se non i prezzi delle camere e degli extra.",1,2020,08,22
05,Weekend ad Ischia,"Ogni volta che ritorno a soggiornare in questo bellissimo hotel resto sempre incantata dalla splendida struttura gestita  in maniera impeccabile da tutto lo staff, con grande professionalità e gentilezza. Per me resta uno degli hotel più belli dell'Isola e con i maggiori servizi tutti a disposizione dei clienti.  Le camere sono tutte fresche e pulite, ancora di più in questo periodo di emergenza Covid, anzi ho notato la massima attenzione da parte di tutto il personale nel far rispettare tutte le regole di distanziamento , sopratutto a colazione. Grazie per aver reso il ns weekend meraviglioso!",5,2020,07,29
05,Perfetto,"Con una menzione speciale per l’eccellente Chief Concierge Ciro, tutta la struttura sia pure appena riaperta dopo l’emergenza ha coniugato alla perfezione le esigenze di sicurezza che la norma ancora imponeva con le peculiarità di un Hotel 5 stelle di lunga tradizione.",5,2020,07,24
05,Bello ma da ristrutturare ,"Posizione dell’hotel ottima, direttamente sul mare e a pochi passi dai negozi.
Parco e giardino bellissimi, come anche la piscina, la pedana a mare e la spiaggia di sabbia.

La struttura è molto di effetto, ma ha bisogno di una ristrutturazione: camere, zone comuni, arredi, ristorante, tutto.

Camera di giusta dimensione con ampio balcone. Gli arredi e la falegnameria sono molto datati.
Bagno non adeguato oggi come allora con phon elettico a parete (tipo motel), doccia senza stabilizzatore di temperatura, rubinetteria logora. 

Wi-Fi inesistente e il cellulare praticamente non prende quindi va assolutamente potenziato x offrire un servizio adeguato.

Navetta x il porto precisa ma la vettura è vecchia e rumorosa e andrebbe sostituita.

Ristorante: forse la nota peggiore per noi che abbiamo preso la formula con cena. tovagliato glicine degli anni 70, sedie interne inguardabili, Buffet di antipasti a livello ospedaliero (dopo la prima sera non ci siamo più avvicinati), povera la presentazione, primi e secondi al 90% di terra/carne e non di mare e soprattutto molto molto invernali con radicchio, con gorgonzola, con noci, cotture all’amarone (forse lo chef ha confuso le stagioni). Frutta e dolci di nuovo a buffet senza infamia e senza lode. Carta dei vini molto limitata.

A pranzo (a la carte) abbiamo notato un lieve miglioramento...anche se il menu senza i prezzi induce in errore facendo credere ad una formula chiusa (come pubblicizzato su Booking) salvo poi scoprire alla fine del soggiorno di aver pagato una scaloppina di medio livello 25 euro, altri piatti 18/20. Certo siamo in 5 stelle e non pretendevano di pagare poco ma almeno conoscere i prezzi....e cmq il disallineamento rispetto alla cena è veramente assurdo.
Si salva solo il fatto che è una bella terrazza sul mare 

Comunque ritorneremo ma suggerirei una ristrutturazione facendo molta attenzione a non snaturare la struttura e cercando di mantenere le tante bellissime cose presenti",3,2020,07,21
05,Preisleistungsverhältnis stimmt nicht,"Das Hotel ist sehr in die Jahre gekommen und leider lässt die Sauberkeit zu wünschen übrig: Als wir unser Zimmer bezogen, fanden wir auf dem Balkon noch eine leere Weinflasche und im Zimmer altes Obst zur Begrüßung vor. Fünf Sterne sind das nicht.

Das Hotel ist alles in allem aber nicht übel. Das Personal war überwiegend freundlich und das Frühstück hervorragend. Die Aussicht war grandios und der Hotelstrand schön. Für den Preis aber zu teuer.

Leider hatten wir auch ein sehr unerfreuliches Ereignis zu beklagen: Meine Frau schloss ihren Ehering während eines Frühstücks nicht im Zimmertresor ein, sondern ließ ihn (leichtsinnigerweise) auf dem Nachtkästchen liegen. Als wir in das mittlerweile gereinigte Zimmer zurückkamen, war er weg. Wir wissen nicht, wo er hingekommen und wie er weggekommen ist. Womöglich ist er beim Reinigen versehentlich eingesaugt, in den Putzeimer gewischt o.Ä. worden.",2,2019,12,24
05,1. Woche Entspannung ,"Leider keine 5. Sterne. Frühstück eigentlich niveaulos.Säfte nicht frisch, Espresso u. Cappuccino auch nicht( wahrscheinlich Instantkaffee), ein Unding in Italy. Jeden Abend bis Mitternacht Beschallung von der Bühne. Ohne Fenster zu gehts nicht. Der Gesamtzustand in die Jahre gekommen. Der italienische Charme ist da, kostet aber auch ordentlich. Meine Erwartungen sind dann immer etwas höher, als wenn man 3-4 Sterne bucht. Service war okay, nett, bemüht. Habe von einem Insulaner erfahren, das die Inhaber viel Geld haben und geizig sind. Passt zum Gesamteindruck.

05,Cortesia,"Frequentiamo questo hotel da molti anni e quest'anno vi abbiamo soggiornato nell'ultima settimana di agosto. La struttura si segnala soprattutto per l'assoluta cortesia del personale. Notevoli anche  i servizi offerti, essendo la struttura dotata di piscine (di cui una termale), della spiaggia, della spa e di una splendida terrazza fronte mare.  Camera spaziosa, luminosa e con ragguardevole vista panoramica. Ottima la pulizia. La posizione dell'albergo risulta eccellente anche per la vicinanza con il centro di Ischia Porto, facilmente raggiungibile a piedi.",5,2019,09,02
05,disappunto,"Mi trovo costretta a formulare una recensione ben lontana rispetto a quella relativa ad un mio precedente soggiorno nella struttura del Punta Molino. Posso dire che l'accoglienza e la gentilezza del personale sono state eccellenti. Il servizio spiaggia ottimo, con i ragazzi sempre disponibili ad ogni richiesta. Andando alle note dolenti, la stanza che mi è stata data non rispettava in alcun modo gli standard di un 5 stelle, era alquanto angusta, un po' ""vecchiotta"", con cromature scrostate e con un servizio di cortesia molto limitato. La pulizia invece è stata buona. ho trovato alquanto inconcepibile che la ricezione dei cellulare fosse insufficiente il che costringeva ad appoggiarsi ad un wi-fi del tutto carente. Ciò che mi ha lasciato sgomenta e che ha rappresentato il motivo principale per il quale formulo questa recensione è l'aver notato dei residui di spine di pesce negli interstizi della piscina termale, evidentemente residui di qualche cena o cerimonia.",3,2019,08,27
05,È ormai una certezza ma......,"Siamo tornati in questo hotel, circondato da un bel polmone di verde, dopo un anno ed abbiamo avuto conferma dell’ottima impressione che ci aveva fatto. Molto comodo e tutto concentrato. Spiaggia, piscina di acqua dolce, piscina termale, beauty farm tutto nel raggio di poche decine di metri. Magnifica e bellissima la terrazza sul mare dove viene servita la prima colazione e la cena.  Buona la ristorazione con buone materie prime, anche se un po’ ripetitiva. Qualche miglioramento andrebbe fatto sulla frutta . Di ottimo livello la pasticceria sia a colazione che la sera a cena. Camere pulite e funzionali. Appena deficitario il servizio dei 4 bagnini sia in piscina che sulle spiagge dell’albergo: riesce talvolta difficile trovarli. Personale diligente e molto professionale sia in sala che alla reception. Molto bravi i cantanti che allietano gli ospiti tutte le sere.  Insomma con qualche lieve miglioramento non esiterei a concedergli l’eccellenza.",4,2019,08,11
05,Vacanza ad Ischia,"Ho soggiornato i primi di agosto in questo hotel che vale tutte le sue 5 stelle.

Arredamento classico ma elegante, camera standard con balcone vista parco,grande e illuminata. Pulizia eccellente e staff molto gentile soprattutto il maitre Salvatore e tutto il settore ristorante. Avendo allungato la vacanza di un giorno abbiamo soggiornato quest ultimo nella camera della torre. Ecco questa la sconsiglio perché troppo piccolina e vecchiotta rispetto alle altre,poco insonorizzata e solo in quella stanza i cellulari non prendevano!",5,2019,08,10
05,UN SOGNO,"Un soggiorno indimenticabile in una location immersa nel verde, il personale ci ha fatti sentire a casa nostra.

Le piscine...non si possono descrivere =) bisogna provarle!!
",5,2019,08,08
05,Una coccola,"L'albergo è in una delle piu' belle posizioni di Ischia porto. Isolato nel suo parco ma, al tempo stesso, sul mare e a pochissime centinaia di metri dai negozi dello shopping. Le camere ti consentono una vista che spazia dal castello aragonese alla costa napoletana. Vedere il sole sorgere dietro Napoli è uno spettacolo incredibile.
Ma il vero valore aggiunto non è ancora dato da questo. Il valore aggiunto è dato da un personale che ti coccola da mattina a sera sempre con il sorriso sulle labbra.
Un accenno al responsabile dello snack bar La Vela, aperto dalle 8.30 alle 24.00. Praticamente con lui e la sua ottima equipe si convive tutta la giornata visto che servono anche in piscina e al mare e in serata ospitano il piano bar dove operano Ciro e Sonya tra i piu' ecclettici e completi artisti di piano bar.
Bene Ciro Iacono dirige in maniera ottimale prevenendo sempre i desiderata dei clienti, grazie anche alla collaborazione di Giorgio, Nicola, Concetta, Martina e Luigi.
Degono di nota infine, il ristorante con il maitre Salvatore e con Franco, sempre eccezionali e attenti",5,2019,08,05
05,Una garanzia,"Il punta molino di Ischia si conferma per noi una garanzia e una certezza. Quest’anno la vacanza si presentava come rovinata per il mancato arrivo di un bagaglio speddito via corriere da bologna. La mobilitazione di tutto il ricevimento e l’impegno di Ciro lauro ci ha permesso di recuperarlo sia pure in ritardo.  Il ristorante è ancora migliorato ornai chef Alfonso è nella pienah maturità e sarebbe il caso che qualche guida si ricordasse di questo ristorante d’albergo, tra i migliori dell’isola. Tutti i settori girano alla perfezione grazie all’impegno del personale guidato dalk’ottimo direttore. Un personale come quello del bar che servendo anche le piscine e i servizi a mare costringe i ragazzi a chilometri sotto il sole perfettamente vestiti. E finito il turno continua a sorridere. Non so proprio come fanno
Ormai è diventata la nostra “residenza estiva”. Un posto così si può solo amare",5,2019,08,04

Sempre una garanzia,"Ho soggiornato presso questo hotel per il secondo anno consecutivo e rinnovo i miei complimenti a questa struttura molto raffinata ma al tempo stesso fresca, con un clima cordiale, personale altamente qualificato, cortese e professionale. I servizi offerti sono eccezionali, con una cura per la pulizia e il rispetto delle esigenze di ogni singolo cliente. Ho soggiornato in una junior suite con terrazzo molto confortevole. A quanto pare è diventata un'abitudine tornare al Punta Molino.
Un cordiale saluto a tutto lo staff e i miei complimenti per la gestione.",5,2019,08,04
05,Ottimo e consigliato,"Che dire passare 5 giorni immersi in una oasi di pace relax e mare con la propria famiglia in questo scenario dove è ubicato il resort è stato eccezionale, peccato che i 5 giorni siano passati troppo in fretta, spero di poterci ritornare il prossimo anno.

La professionalità del concierge, la disponibilità del capo ricevimento, la cortesia del direttore, l'abilità dello chef e la carineria del maitre, nonché il sorriso delle bellissime ragazze al bar, sono riusciti ad offuscare l'unicità di un posto semplicemente già di suo perfetto!!!!!! Mia moglie così felice non la vedevo da tempo e, quindi, grazie, grazie, grazie!!!!!!",5,2019,07,02
05,Il meglio di Ischia,"Siamo stati al Punta Molino per un weekend lungo ricevuto come regalo di compleanno. L’albergo è un po’ datato ma non è un difetto, semmai un pregio. Tutto è in perfetto stato di conservazione, a dispetto del peggiore consumismo, quello dei mobili usa e getta, dando la sensazione di tornare indietro nel tempo. La struttura è una perla tra il parco e la spiaggia, in un luogo defilato quanto basta rispetto al caos del centro. Lo consiglio ad un pubblico esigente in grado di apprezzare la raffinatezza, il buon gusto nella gestione della relazione, la compagnia delle persone discrete, silenziose, in una parola bene educate. Ricercata e genuina la cucina sia nel buffet della colazione che della cena. Spero di ritornare al più presto",5,2019,06,21

05,Un 3 stelle travestito da 5,"Unici due punti a favore di questa struttura sono la location, il personale e la cura del giardino di ingresso.
Il resto da dimenticare: 
1. Le camere piccole e completamente da ristrutturare. L arredamento e finiture sono di fine anni 80, i bagni sono scandalosi non per la pulizia ma per l età, la doccia con struttura in materiale plastico bianco a soffietto. La porta di ingresso con serratura sgangherata e il battente della porta di ingresso alla camera che cade a pezzi. 
2. Le piscine completamente da ristrutturare cadono anche loro a pezzi e spolverano l intonaco delle fughe dentro l acqua. La piscina calda esterna vantata come acqua termale, in realtà non è altro che acqua di mare riscaldata (se volevo fare talasso terapia andavo in un altro posto...).
3. La colazione. Tutto il cibo e le bevande della colazione è di terza scelta. I cornetti e le paste erano dure probabilmente del giorno prima, marmellate e corn flackes forniti nei barattolini e nelle buste come nelle pensioni a 1 stella. I succhi di ultima categoria dal sapore chimico. 

Assolutamente non consigliato, rapporto qualità prezzo indecente!!!!!",1,2019,06,07
05,Assolutamente non da 5 stelle,Un 5 stelle che non ha in funzione aria condizionata per il periodo costringendo a dormire con la finestra aperta mangiati dalle zanzare.. una spa di scarsissimo livello.. un gatto che gironzolava nell'area ristoro.. qualità dei primi piatti scarsa.. l'unica nota positiva è il personale.. da un 5 stelle si aspettano servizi di un certo livello che assolutamente mancano di qualità.. sarebbe il caso di togliere qualche stellina ne guadagnerebbe in immagine,1,2019,05,21
05,Relax,Personale molto competente e disponibile. Ottima cucina con ampia scelta. Camere forse un po' da ritoccare essendo l'albergo alquanto datato. Spazi comuni molto ampi ed eleganti. Tre piscine di cui due riscaldate. Bel parco con ampia vegetazione. Spiaggia privata davanti all'albergo. Lo consiglio anche se da un 5 stelle mi aspetterei di più. ,4,2019,05,16
05,Toglierei un paio di stelle,"Bello il posto, originale, benché datato l'edificio che 'casca' direttamente in piscina. Le piscine sono pulite e valide. Il personale è molto gentile e simpatico. Stanza piccola, bagno senza finestra? Che problema c'è? C'è l'aspiratore! Peccato che l'aspirazione non è attiva durante la presenza in bagno ma è centralizzata e parte in piena notte facendo parecchio rumore. Il primo giorno abbassato il tappo del bidè non è più risalito. Sono intervenuti solo il giorno successivo per metterlo a posto. Dunque, odore di gabinetto permanente in bagno, e non solo. Odore di bagno anche in una zona delle parti comuni dell'hotel. E credetemi, non odore di zolfo termale. Su richiesta, ci sono state servite alcune bottiglie d'acqua con magnifici limoni locali con la proverbiale gentilezza del persone del luogo. I limoni non vengono puliti, spazzolati. Serviti sporchi o probabile residui di fumaggine. Mi Dispiace, ma oltre un certo livello, non ci si aspetta tali superficialità! Consiglio: Diminuite le stelline o per lo meno, migliorate i servizi.",3,2019,05,05
05,Posizione stupenda,"L'albergo occupa davvero una posizione magica, tra Ischia Porto e Ischia Ponte, immerso in una ricca vegetazione, con accesso diretto a una spiaggia riservata, piscina coperta e scoperta.
La camera é arrotondata, come la sagoma della struttura, con mattonelle colorate, tipiche della zona. La pulizia é perfetta. Non do la quinta pallina perché la colazione non mi é sembrata all'altezza di un 5 stelle e la piscina scoperta aveva sempre solo due su tre bocchette funzionanti. Sono peccati veniali, ma è ovvio che si deve essere esigenti quando si sceglie un hotel di livello. 
Ci tornerei, ma pagando un prezzo inferiore.
Un grazie speciale a Ciro, sempre presente al posto di comando, che è riuscito a risolverci un problema burocratico.",4,2019,05,05
05,Relax e coccole,"Albergo molto bello, interni eleganti.  Camere comode e spaziose. Pulizia ottima.
Personale attento e competente. Cucina buona. Le piscine termali veramente belle 
Andrebbe reso più accogliente l'ambiente della piscina coperta. La Spa è un po' piccola ma funzionante. Molto brava nei massaggi la signora Emanuela. Ottimo il piano bar con una vocalist di talento, peccato il repertorio un po' ripetitivo. Location eccezionale.",5,2019,05,01
05,Cordialità ,"Lo staff molto gentile e disponibile; hotel pulito, posizione adiacente al mare molto comoda, ci è piaciuto; si mangia bene e i letti sono molto comodi! Tre le piscine sue piccole all’esterno e una riscaldata all’interno, nella parte della piscina al chiuso ci sarebbero dei lavoretti da fare per rinnovare lo spazio leggermente datato, i fiori di plastica non mi sono piaciuti.",5,2019,04,28

Personale disponibile e gentile.
L hotel dispone di una piccola vasca esterna con acqua termale(37 gradi) è una piccola spiaggia privata.
Colazione buona.

05,Una meraviglia,"Che dire....splendido....una vera meraviglia....andate e divertitevi .....avrete sicuramente un ricordo da condividere....tutto ottimo, dalla cucina al personale alla struttura....non ho nulla da dire se non ....una vera meraviglia",5,2018,10,01
05,Il punto di forza è il personale ma non è un hotel 5 stelle,"Ho scelto questo hotel guardando le recensioni. Sicuramente la posizione è ottima, forse la migliore di Ischia. L’hotel però avrebbe bisogno di essere ristrutturato nelle camere, nello spazio adibito alle terme e ai trattamenti.
Ho scelto una junior suite in villa e vi assicuro che non è una camera adeguata ad un hotel 5 stelle: dalla doccia usciva acqua, c’erano parti arrugginite, il lavandino aveva delle crepe... La stanza era ampia ma non c’era un salottino nè un bollitore per le tisane....
L’area dedicata alle terme è priva di spazi relax e gli ambienti sono proprio datati.
Per fortuna la cortesia e la disponibilità del personale hanno compensato le carenze strutturali. 
La cucina è buona ma con prezzi non adeguati alla qualità. I prezzi sono da 5 stelle!
Non voglio dire che sia tutto negativo ma da un hotel 5 stelle mi aspettavo di più.",4,2018,09,30
05,Weekend di relax,"Eccellente in tutto. Un plauso particolare al personale...simpaticissimo e disponibilissimo.
Siamo a livelli altissimi in tutto.
Non vedo l'ora di tornarci.Una menzione particolare per il sig. Ciro della reception: impeccabile.",5,2018,09,20
05,Cinque stelle quasi perfetto...,"In una delle più suggestive posizioni dell 'Isola di Ischia, accanto al castello Aragonese e di fronte a Procida, si trova il Grand Hotel Punta Molino Beach Resort and Spa. Un cinquestelle immerso in un grande parco suggestivo e gardevole ha il suo sbocco sul mare con tre spiagge e pontili attrezzati , curati e ben serviti. Accanto la Spa all'altezza di ogni desiderio e piscine termali e non. Le camere, spaziose e sempre curate, sono perfette e la vista del mare e del panorama è mozzafiato. Siamo stati accolti con spumante e frutta  di bosco. Il personale è cordiale e preparato con quel pizzico di fantasia e accoglienza tutta partenopea. Simpatia e impeccabile professionalità ischitana, da non confondere con Napoli o Capri... c'è una sorta di sottile rivalità, anch'essa però simpatica. Colazione in terrazza vista mare pranzo o cena lo stesso. A mezzodì, scaldati dal sole, dopo uno o più bagni ristoratori in acque limpidissime, è interessante pranzare nel baretto vicino per gustare specialità e pesce del luogo. Una piccola pecca , tanto per trovare il pelo nell'uovo a tanta perfezione, i numerosi matrimoni che, a volte costringevano a cenare nella bella sala interna, come pure una certa ripetitività nel buffet di antipasti e dolci. Peraltro i menù erano vari, ben cucinati e ben serviti. Forse ci sammo aspettati, nel Golfo di Napoli, dei primi piatti più sfiziosi. Qualche difficoltà per il wi-fi in camera , ma i complimenti sono di gran lunga superiori a qualche piccola critica , spero costruttiva e non certo offensiva in questa oasi di paradiso. Questo anche perchè il desiderio è quello di tornare al più presto. Il prezzo del soggiorno è adeguato ad un Grand Hotel di lusso, così come vini ed extra. Piacevole gustare , dopo cena un ottimo cocktail accompagnati dalla musica ed il canto del bravissimo pianista , spesso accompagnato da una giovane e talentuosa cantante. Non mancheranno famose canzoni partenopee e musica a richiesta. Il sole si è tuffato nel mare ed il cielo si riempie di stelle. E' ora di riposare aspettando un'altra giornata di riposo o una gita a Capri . Consigliato .",4,2018,09,19
05,Splendido Hotel!,"Splendido hotel: ci si sta e ci si sente a proprio agio e benissimo dal primo istante ... e si desidera di ritornarci! È l’insieme delle caratteristiche dell’hotel - tutte eccellenti - che rende il soggiorno, oltre che piacevolissimo, memorabile! Struttura di elegante essenziale bellezza, progettata, realizzata, arredata e gestita benissimo; posizione immersa nel verde e sul mare, con panorama eccezionale, comodissima anche per raggiungere a piedi le zone di passeggio e shopping; ampio parco; piscine interne e esterne, termali e non; spiaggia e molo privati; SPA per trattamenti olistici e cure termali complete; cucina ottima e sana; intrattenimento musicale serale di grande maestria e raffinatezza; etc. etc. ... Il personale è tutto di elevata professionalità, efficiente disponibile cordiale e profondamente gentile.",5,2018,09,12
05,"Bellissimo, ma...","Abbiamo soggiornato all’inizio di settembre con la famiglia, in questo hotel scelto in base alle recensioni dei membri di Tripadvisor. Sono molto felice della scelta fatta, ma concordo con le critiche mosse dagli altri precedentemente; basterebbe molto poco per far svettare questa struttura in cima alla classifica! L’hotel è inserito in un bel parco ricco di piante mediterranee e fiori. 
La posizione è incantevole e suggestiva, si nuota sotto la protezione del Castello Aragonese, l’acqua è sempre cristallina e piacevolissima. L’albergo ha 3 cale  di sabbia attrezzate con lettini e ombrelloni, il servizio dei bagnini è ottimo. Spiaggia sempre pulitissima e curata, non affollata, buoni i servizi. 
Meravigliosa l’area della piscina sempre ventilata, confortevole e rilassante anche la piscina termale di acqua calda con l’idromassaggio.
Non di grandi dimensioni ma funzionali l’area wellness e la piscina coperta.
La posizione riservata e tranquilla e  direttamente  sul mare non impedisce all’albergo di vantare la sua comodità anche nei confronti della vita notturna di Ischia...in un paio di minuti a piedi si raggiungono il centro storico di Ischia Ponte e il corso Colonna con i suoi innumerevoli negozi!
L’albergo pur avendo una struttura moderna, è arredato al suo interno in maniera classica ma non leziosa. Le camere sono sobrie, comode, materasso ottimo, servizi spaziosi con vasca e doccia. 
Pulizia molto buona.
La reception fa meritare  all’albergo la votazione migliore: gentilezza, disponibilità  e competenza sono le caratteristiche comuni a tutto lo staff! Complimenti sinceri! 
È vero la rete wi-fi non è il massimo, ma ho verificato questa difficoltà in tutta l’isola. In camera si faceva veramente fatica a navigare anche perché il nostro gestore telefonico non aveva ricezione.
È vero anche che in alcune zone intorno alla piscina e soprattutto nelle zone in cui batte il vento e più colpite dalla salsedine, sarebbe opportuno apportare delle migliorie alle rifiniture!
Per me comunque i punti più critici sono nella sala ristorante: con una rotonda aperta sul mare è piacevolissimo, sì, far colazione pranzare e cenare con la ricchezza del buffet molto vario e abbondante con rosticceria, verdure, antipasti di carne e pesce e latticini freschissimi ...ma la cucina dovrebbe rispondere in maniera adeguata. Invece devo dire che la cucina è discreta, con prodotti di qualità, ma non in grado di emozionare come invece siamo avezzi in qualunque luogo al Sud! 
Buono ma non eccellente il servizio dei camerieri...il Maestro di Sala sembra esser uscito da un film dei fratelli Vanzina, mista alla simpatia tutta partenopea che caratterizza questo popolo sarebbero gradite anche competenza e professionalità!
La proprietà dovrebbe tener in considerazione di fare ancora un piccolo passo per raggiungere l’eccellenza che le 5 stelle reclamano!! 
Detto questo, ci ritornerei già ieri!

05,Da provare ,"C’è poco da dire, ottimo albergo, sicuramente da provare, situato in una posizione strategica, dista dal corso principale cinque minuti a piedi, ma nello stesso tempo è lontano dalla calca. La struttura è dotata di spiaggia privata oltre a piscine termali, degna di nota è l’efficienza dei bagnini sempre pronti a sostituire gli asciugamani o a soddisfare una tua richiesta. Stessa cosa dicasi per il personale di sala, dal maitre, al responsabile del bar ai camerieri tutti molto professionali sempre gentili, discreti ma  accoglienti.  Ottima la cucina, bravissimo il cuoco con piatti sempre di livello con più scelte ogni giorno, preparati con prodotti freschi e di prima qualità. Una menzione particolare al pasticciere e ai suoi dolci, non posso dire altro sono solo da provare. Le camere sono tutte ben tenute, pulite, con materassi comodissimi, quella che mi è stata data per di più aveva una vista magnifica.

05,Un ottimo rifugio nel centro di ischia,"Siamo ormai alla quarta o quinta recensione di questo albergo e tutte con il giudizio di eccellente. Mantenere questo standard negli anni è sinonimo di capacità imprenditoriale e di sapere ben cogliere le esigenze del cliente. Dall’arrivo a Napoli, il transfert in albergo e i successivi servizi di tutte le sezioni dell’albergo (ricevimento, camere, spiaggia e piscine, terme, bar) ti consentono di sentirti coccolato e per un attimo re in una location di sogno con il golfo di Napoli di fronte. Se a questo aggiungiamo i manicaretti di Alfonso la gestione del capo barman ciro e dei suoi ottimi collaboratori e il sorriso e l’abnegazione al lavoro di tutti che sarebbe impossibile citare ti portano a dire che qui il relax e il riposo sono una certezza pur essendo a due passi dalla movida di Ischia porto. Certo la struttura impone investimenti ma credetemi regge comunque molto bene i suoi anni",5,2018,08,03
05,Gran bella struttura,"la struttura è bellissima, ben tenuta, elegante e comoda a due passi dal centro di Ischia e con spiaggia privata e mare cristallino. camere spaziose e confortevoli. servizio impeccabile, tutti molto cortesi e disponibili. il ristorante serve piatti semplici ma di ottima qualità. unici aspetti da migliorare riguardano la colazione che secondo me dovrebbe essere più variegata e prevedere dei piatti caldi fatti al momento ( tipo pancakes, crepes, omelette, etc...) e il buffet degli antipasti serali che è alquanto ripetitivo. questi ultimi però sono solo aspetti che andrebbero curati meglio ma che non inficiano la mia valutazione. assolutamente da consigliare!",5,2018,08,02
05,Ottimo per vacanza in famiglia,"Abbiamo trascorso 10 giorni di vacanza in questo bellissimo hotel. La location è imbattibile, situato proprio sul mare tra Ischia porto e ponte. La nostra camera, una junior suite composta da due camere con vista mozzafiato sul Castello Aragonese. Servizio eccellente in ogni reparto, dal ricevimento al ristorante, al servizio in spiaggia. Piccola colazione a buffet servito sulla terrazza esterna con ampia scelta. Buon ristorante con menu ridotto per la mezza pensione. Forse ci saremo aspettati più selezione di pesce. Tuttavia ampia scelta di antipasti e dolci a buffet. Cibo e servizio ottimo.
Belle le piscine sia termale che con acqua dolce. Il mare è pulito con spiaggia proprio davanti l'albergo. Lettini, ombrelloni e teli mare compresi nel prezzo.
Tutto perfetto grazie all'ottima regia del direttore e del suo team affiatato.
Unico neo, per essere un 5 stelle, forse qualche area dell'albergo necessità di qualche investimento ed alcuni dettagli nelle camere migliorabili.

05,Esperienza da ripetere assolutamente!,"Sono tornata 2 giorni fa da una mini-vacanza di quattro notti presso questo hotel. Non so da dove partire per esprimere la mia gioia e soddisfazione per i servizi offerti. Struttura tenuta molto bene, a pochissimi passi dal mare, con una cura attenta alla pulizia e all' ordine delle sale interne, del giardino, delle piscine e della terrazza dove veniva consumata la colazione e la cena. 
Personale cortese, competente e cordiale.
La spiaggia la definirei ""sfiziosa"", con ombrelloni dislocati in vari punti e bagnini sempre attenti e disponibili.
Le due piscine esterne (di cui una termale) e quella interna ben tenute e suggestive.
I momenti preferiti erano quelli dei pasti per la varietà, la qualità e la genuinità delle pietanze. La prima colazione era tutta al buffet con una scelta che spaziava dalle uova al tegamino preparate al momento, al salmone, alla ricotta di bufala, al classico croissant, frutta etccc.. Pensate a qualcosa e...qui la troverete!
La cena era servita al tavolo (i piatti principali) e con un vasto buffet di contorni sia caldi che freddi: una vera delizia.
Il tutto contornato dal panorama suggestivo del mare e della piscina. Vorrei ringraziare tutto il personale per il clima cordiale e professionale con il quale ogni giorno ci accolgono.

Ci hanno fatto visitare la struttura e abbiamo anche parlato del menù e di tutto quello che concerne un matrimonio. La prima cosa assurda è che c’è ne siamo andati senza un’idea di prezzo ma ci hanno detto di richiamare per farci mandare il preventivo via mail... PREVENTIVO MAI ARRIVATO!!! 
Ora, noi abbiamo scelto un’altra location più curata e nuova... ma ci tengo a dire che non mi sarei aspettata un trattamento così da un hotel 5 stelle!!!",1,2018,07,11

Ci hanno prenotato una barca con skipper facendoci venire a prendere direttamente sul piccolo molo dell' hotel .

05,Piacevolissima sorpresa,"Le titubanze iniziali, forse indotte da qualche recensione maldicente, sono state immediatamente smentite nel momento dell’arrivo in albergo. Innanzitutto un polmone di verde circonda l’albergo confermando l’appellativo di Ischia come isola verde ma ciò che davvero mi ha piacevolmente impressionato è la magnifica terrazza , dove viene servita la prima colazione e la cena, che trovasi praticamente sul mare. Piscina di acqua dolce e piscina di acqua termale sono praticamente attaccate e sono ubicate a dieci metri dal mare, così come la terrazza. Nei giorni che sono stato ospite dell’albergo con mia moglie l’acqua del mare era molto pulita (altro bonus), cosa che non succede sempre in altre zone dell’isola. Servizio in sala impeccabile con i camerieri attenti ad ogni esigenza dell’ospite. Che dire poi della prima colazione: di ottimo livello, varia e completa, con particolare riguardo ai dolci preparati quotidianamente dal pasticciere che è un maestro di leggerezza. Altra piacevole sorpresa è stata la cena preceduta da un ricco e vario buffet di antipasti e chiusa da un buffet di dolci e frutta. Mi sa che sarò obbligato a ritornarci......",5,2018,06,23

05,non è un 5 stelle,"struttuta da enormi potenzialita, gode di una posizione fantastica peccato che sia l'hotel che i servizi siano rimasti fermi agli anni 80'. Un vero peccato anche in considerazione dei prezzi che sicuramente non giustificano la spesa. Colazione nella media. Inesistente il servzio dopo le 23 .",2,2018,02,20
05,Che bell'albergo,"Abbiamo avuto modo di essere ospiti dell'hotel con due coppie di amici.
Siamo rimasti sorpresi per la professionalità, la pulizia, la cortesia del personale, ma soprattutto per la qualità del cibo e la ricchezza della cantina. Il servizio termale è completo e le signore che hanno fatto trattamenti estetici e massaggi si sono ritemprate. L'anno prossimo ritorneremo sicuramente, anche se abbiamo avuto qualche problema nei trasferimenti.",5,2017,12,14
05,5 Sterne sind max. 4 Sterne,"Die Freundlichkeit, Sauberkeit und Service waren gut bis sehr gut. Lage ganz nah beim Strand war ausgezeichnet und das Essen im ein bisschen improvisierten aber gut entwickelten Strandlokal war super. Einrichtung und allg. Zustand des Hotels sind deutlich in die Jahre gekommen. Wie meist in Italien, es wird nur renoviert was unbedingt notwendig - also kaputt ist und nicht was man renovieren müsste! Trotzdem kann ich das Hotel empfehlen, Sonne, Strand und Städtchen - alles da! 

Lungomare zum Castello Aragonese - na ja, typische italienische Sauerei. Auch in den Seitenstrassen ist es so. Capri hat uns ausgesprochen gut gefallen, sehr sauber, ausgesprochen schöne Shops (Sandalen, Spezialitäten, Blusen aus Leinen etc.). Tagesausflug zu kurz, sehr viele Touristen aber mit Guide machbar als wirklicher Kurztrip. ",3,2017,10,31
05,Buono ma non da cinque stelle,"Location favolosa per un albergo che forse avrebbe bisogno di una rinfrescata personale molto valido e professionale...forse anche troppo perché sfociava in freddezza; cucina discreta ma niente più...la pasta ogni volta era veramente troppo al dente...porzioni miti... servizio in sala buono
Buon posto ma poteva essere eccezionale",3,2017,10,08

05,MERAVIGLIOSO,"Un albergo che non ha bisogno di chissà quante recensioni, in quanto parla da sé: location strategica, struttura d'incanto, cibo divino, staff perfetto, piano bar serale eccellente... cos'altro aggiungere?! I proprietari sono favolosi! Andare ad Ischia per noi significa andare all'hotel Punta Molino, non esistono alternative! Unico albergo ad Ischia che consiglio con tutto l'affetto e sincerità. ",5,2017,10,03
05,Relax in contesto incantevole,"Struttura all'interno di un parco a ridosso del mare con piscina (anche termale) esterna ed interna zona SPA. Camere di varie tipologie e prezzi, alcune dislocate fuori dal blocco centrale, molto confortevoli con dotazione completa di accessori (compresi soffici accappatoi). Frutta fresca di benvenuto in camera molto gradita. Personale molto professionale in grado di assistere la clientela a 360° gradi per qualsiasi necessità, informazione o trasferimenti (gratuito con navetta hotel per Ischia Porto a tutte le ore).
Ottima colazione completa (dolce e salato) a buffet, servita purtroppo solo fino alle 10.30 senza recupero, neanche in forma limitata sia pure per un caffè (che diventa a pagamento), presso il bar dell'hotel. Bar che chiude troppo presto la sera e che non supporta il servizo in camera h24 (neanche per una camomilla notturna); da un 5 stelle è un servizio che mi aspetto. Inoltre ricarichi elevati al bar della piscina (15 euro per uno spritz) non giustificabili dal solo prestigio dell'hotel (servito semplicemente con un paio di snack da supermarket). Nel complesso esperienza positiva sicuramente da consigliare per una vacanza al top",5,2017,09,05
05,Splendidi giorni al Punta Molino,"Questa recensione è scritta dai miei genitori che hanno soggiornato all'hotel punta molino dal 18 al 25 agosto 2017.
Abbiamo soggiornato in questa bellissima struttura, ci siamo trovati benissimo. Tutto qui è a livelli eccellenti. La camera, bellissima e silenziosa. Il servizio, pronto ed affabile. La cucina è eccellente (anche troppo, considerato che è alle porte il matrimonio di nostra figlia e i sarti si sono raccomandati......) L'acqua del mare antistante l'hotel è pulita e trasparente. la piscina termale calda è una vera goduria. ci siamo goduti una settimana da sogno. Grazie a tutto lo staff e all'efficientissimo e cortesissimo direttore. Arrivederci a presto.

05,vacanza di lusso con coccole,"Ho deciso di recarmi per un weekend nell' Hotel Punta Molino, perchè si trovava in un punto strategico dell' Isola d' Ischia, sul mare, vicino al porto ed ai luoghi più frequentati. Non conoscevo l' organizzazione dell' Hotel, ma già alla prima telefonata mi sono sentito subito a mio agio. Mi ha risposto una receptionist garbatissima, Caterina, che mi ha dato brevemente tutte le informazioni di cui avevo bisogno. Ho prenotato al volo una splendida stanza con vista sul mare. L' albergo è dotato di numerosi sevizi, dalla navetta che ti preleva al porto al tuo arrivo e ti riaccompagna alla partenza, alle piscine (termali e non), discesa a mare e molti altri, ma in primis la cortesia e la disponibilità del personale tutto, dai bagnini ai camerieri. Ci sono ritornato dopo 15 giorni e prevedo di tornarci ancora. Un ringraziamento allo staff ed a Caterina.",5,2017,08,31

Grazie a tutti da Massimo Fava",5,2017,08,30
05,Posto incantevole,"Siamo tornati in questo splendido hotel dopo 10 anni e ne siamo rimasti entusiasti. La nostra camera era molto ampia pur non essendo una suite con un terrazzo fantastico con area solarium, area relax ombreggiata e doccia ma ciò che ci ha colpito al cuore è stata la vista mozzafiato fronte mare e a 360 gradi tutto intorno all'hotel compreso il Castello Aragonese. Ambienti molto eleganti, piscine esterne ed una interna nell'area Spa. Spiaggette antistanti l'hotel molto comode. Ottima e curata la ristorazione. Tutto il personale cordiale e disponibile ha reso indimenticabile la nostra vacanza. Raccomandato!",5,2017,08,28

05,Vacanza di 8 giorni ad agosto 2017,"Classe, efficienza, eleganza, professionalità. Hotel meraviglioso con staff qualificato ed attento ai minimi dettagli. Consigliatissimo anche per chi ha amici a quattro zampe.
N.B. piscine interne ed esterne, spiaggia privata con bagnini presenti e cordiali, piccolo centro spa con possibilità di massaggi, colazione ottima variegata ed abbondante, ristorante eccellente con servizio ottimo e pietanze di qualità. Anche la mia piccola Maltesina MIA ringrazia tutti",5,2017,08,25
05,Sogno o son desta?,"L'hotel Punta Molino è una sicurezza per tutti coloro che desiderano trascorrere le proprie vacanze con la certezza di un ambiente accogliente, avvolgente e soprattutto efficiente. Sono appena tornata da Ischia e, nonostante il terremoto che ha colpito Casamicciola, superata la paura per la scossa durata  pochi secondi, la mia vacanza fortunatamente  è continuata con la sicurezza che può dare questa struttura. Si tratta di un Grand Hotel che risponde a tutti i requisiti di questa categoria e la conduzione dell'Hotel è da elogiare perché dedica molta attenzione al cliente. Il prezzo risponde a tutti i servizi offerti. Camere accoglienti, funzionali  e con attenta pulizia,  cambio due volte al giorno degli asciugamani che vengono  forniti ai clienti  in spiaggia, in piscina e in quelle del centro termale interno. La splendida  terrazza ristorante fronte Golfo di Napoli, predispone a gustare l'ottima e varia cucina che non dimentica le tradizioni culinarie campane. E' da menzionare la professionalità e gentilezza degli Chef, dei cuochi e camerieri  assieme al personale della Reception - disponibile a risolvere qualsiasi possibile esigenza. Il dopocena è accompagnato da una piacevole musica dal vivo con  pianista e cantante davvero bravi. In spiaggia Franco e Raffaele ma anche gli altri bagnini sono attenti alle nostre esigenze. Insomma potrei scrivere ancora molto di più ma vorrei dire la cosa più importante, almeno per me: il mare è strepitoso: trasparente e pulito e per tutti i gusti, spiaggia e scogli indistintamente. Se si pensa di poter avere tutto ciò a poco prezzo, indubbiamente non è questo l'Hotel che state cercando. Il prossimo anno, se tutto va bene, ci tornerò.",5,2017,08,25
05,Vacanza tutto relax,"Posto spettacolare , mare con spiaggia privata e acqua stupenda , hotel molto curato sia le stanze , giardini , piscina , molto buono anche il ristorante  e personale gentile e proffesionale . Da consigliare .",5,2017,08,24
05,Soggiorno fine luglio,"Premesso che non è la prima volta al Punta Molino, albergo con location perfetta forse la migliore di ischia. Servizio nelle aspettative personale cortese, un  ringraziamento particolare va obbligatoriamente al Sig. Umberto (bagnino) per aver risolto con estrema  celerità un piccolo ns probelma capitatoci il giorno dell'arrivo.
Si deve costare però purtoppo il cronico problema della WIFI  insufficiente e non rispondente alle aspettative di un albergo di tale categoria considerando altresì la presenza di numerosi stranieri che utilizzano app di chiamata che utilizzano la rete internet. Magari un sistema via etere anziche via cavo potrebbe quasi sicuramente risolvere il problema.
comunque giudizio positivo senza dubbi",4,2017,08,23
05,Ottima Struttura per una vacanza in pieno Relax,"Struttura accogliente con spazi verdi molto curati e parcheggio gratuito all'interno del parco. Molto utile la dotazione di un telecontrollo per accedere con la macchina nella zona a traffico limitato (l'Hotel è praticamente a ridosso dI corso Vittoria Colonna, la centralissima via dello shopping).
La posizione è ideale anche per raggiungere a piedi Ischia Ponte, dove si trova il noto e affascinante castello Aragonese.
Junior Suite Villa molto spaziosa e fresca anche senza uso di aria condizionata, pulizia impeccabile, dotazioni ineccepibili.
Particolare nota di merito ai maitre, Francesco e Salvatore, veri professionisti che hanno contribuito insieme alla buona cucina ad elevare il livello di qualità del nostro soggiorno. Bravi !!",5,2017,08,23
05,C'è tutto quello che stavamo cercando!,"Non sapevamo dove andare in vacanza... proprio attraverso le recensioni di questo sito abbiamo cambiato meta mille volte... siamo esigenti... e non volevamo sbagliare scelta... eravamo alla ricerca di un luogo veramente da 5 stelle... dove doveva essere a portata di un passo: spiaggia privata, piscina, SPA, parco per le passeggiate al fresco con la mia cagnolina, panorama mozzafiato, ristorante con vista, sorrisi, cordialità, premure, centro principale ed elegante della città... e tutto questo lo abbiamo trovato ad Ischia! Dalla prima telefonata con Andrea dell'ufficio informazioni dell'hotel abbiamo capito subito dalla sua disponibilità e comprensione ad ogni nostra richiesta che questo era il posto giusto! Non ho mai trovato un posto dove non ho nulla da ridire... questa è la prima volta e vi scrivo dal bordo piscina d'acqua termale con vista sul mare ed il castello Aragonese... tra due ore saliremo sul traghetto diretti verso casa e lo faremo con una promessa... torneremo qui... presto! Se cercate un posto dove dimenticare di avere una macchina, dove le camere sono splendide e tradizionali del luogo sempre pulite e con continuo cambi di biancheria, un posto dove staccare veramente la spina e godere a pieno del fascino di questa isola raggiungendo a piedi i posti più belli per la sera e per lo shopping beh... L'avete trovato! Un GRAZIE a tutti coloro che lavorano qui... dalla disponibilità smisurata della reseption, al bar e ristorante, a coloro che pulivano la stanza senza dimenticare mai di fare una coccola alla cagnolina, alla simpatia e professionalità dei bagnini... ai proprietari con i quali abbiamo avuto l'occasione di scambiare due chiacchiere convinti che fossero clienti dell'hotel per la loro incredibile umiltà.

05,Location affascinante e accoglienza superlativa ,"Torniamo per l'ennesima volta in questo stupendo albergo di ischia. Accoglienza come sempre superlativa. Dal ricevimento al ristorante brillantemente guidato da franco in sala e Alfonso in cucina, al bar guidato con mano ferma da Ciro e dal suo gruppo e da Sonia e Ciro al piano. Reparto termale e piscine in ordine il tutto ben diretto dal generale manager.  È vero la struttura è come una bella donna un po' avanti negli anni che dimostra l'età che ha e che non consente il massimo dei voti. Ma che bello il posto, che bello il personale che ti saluta con il sorriso ogni volta che ti vede e ti consente di dimenticare qualche ruga di troppo",4,2017,08,13
05,Un'isola incantevole ,"Il Grand Hotel Punta Molino è situato in una posizione incantevole dell'isola.

Meraviglioso affaccio sul mare con un pontile incantevole per prendere il sole.

I servizi sono buoni e il personale gentile e professionale.

La struttura ed in particolare le camere andrebbero rimodernizzate.",5,2017,08,08

05,Splendido contesto,Sono ormai 3 anni che ho il piacere di essere ospite dell'Hotel Punta Molino ad Ischia. Il territorio è spettacolare e la vista del Castello dalla camere da letto alla spiaggia ci fa vivere in esperienza unica. Il servizio è eccellente !!!,5,2017,07,25
05,hotel vecchio che di 5 stelle ha solo un vago ricordo,"abbiamo prenotato questo albergo perché ci attraeva la spiaggia ed i servizi ma abbiamo constatato una struttura inadeguata e vecchia con una situazione manutentiva totalmente insufficiente.
Appena arrivati con pulmino dell'agenzia ed in una struttura dove si entra solo suonando ad una sbarra, ci hanno chiesto: avete una prenotazione? ???...no siamo venuti a vedere la finale di champions league.... !!!!
La camera non era pronta alle ore 11 ed abbiamo dovuto aspettare le ore 14 (nessuno ci aveva detto nulla prima).
La camera era vecchia con griglie scrostate ed un armadio come quello di mia nonna......opacizzato e con uno specchio oramai talmente ossidato che non si vedeva più nulla..... Anche la doccia vecchia (con anta di plastica che chiude il box) e con il flessibile e la cipolla della doccia come un hotel a 3 stelle...Insomma nulla a che vedere con un 5 stelle.
Personale della reception poco gentile e non in grado di risolvere i problemi od accogliere le lamentele. Insomma, sembrava un albergo a fine stagione invece che nel pieno dell'estate.
Molto bene invece la spiaggia attrezzata e con i bagnini altamente professionali così come la due piscine e la possibilità di avere il servizio ristorazione sulla spiaggia. Diciamo che vale la pena per la spiaggia, anche se una parte della stessa è accessibile a chiunque..... insomma non è una spiaggia privata ...lo è solo per i lettini ed ombrelloni...
Bello e curato il giardino (che chiamano parco).
Molto buona la colazione mentre la cena è insufficiente, non da albergo a 5 stelle.
Infine il WiFi c'è ma ..... non si vede....impossibile collegarsi (e tra l'latro il cellulare non prende neanche bene perché non sono dotati di antenna ricevente)
Per concludere chiunque andrà non pensi di trovare un livello a 5 stelle poiché avrebbe bisogno di una profonda ristrutturazione e con personale vecchio stampo.",2,2017,07,24
05,Buono!,"Posizione: ottimo.Servizio: molto buono!Camere: ottimo! Parti comuni un poco datate anche se hanno il loro fascino,i bagni piscina non da cinque stelle e neppure da quattro!Giudizio complessivo buono considerando un accettabile prezzo qualità!Consigliato ai frequentatori di cinque stelle non troppo esigenti!
",4,2017,07,17
05,Relax educazione e pulizia tutto ok !,"Sono stato due giorni a Ischia, anche per lavoro, questa sistemazione è stata eccezionale per chi, come me, ha voglia di non fare assolutamente nulla se non attraversare una strada pedonale, sdraiarsi al sole e fare il bagno !
Ottima la nostra scelta di sola colazione, ci sono un'infinità di ristoranti nella zona che vale la pena visitare. La piscina termale esterna è stupenda e i Bagnini in spiaggia gentilissimi.",5,2017,07,12
05,Bellissima struttura,"Abbiamo passato un weekend in questa stupenda struttura .
Purtroppo non posso dare il massimo dei voti per 3 motivi :
Ristorante Pranzo non è da 5 stelle , ma solo un buon ristorante , abbiamo pagato 15 € un piatto di olio e spaghetti per non parlare degli antipasti a buffet .
L'aria condizionata della camera non era sufficiente fredda con termostati impostati a 5°C e ventole a forza 3 .
Wi-fi inesistente . 

Note positive tante :
Facchino per valigie e parcheggiatore .
reception attenta alle esigenze .
3 piscine , solarium , spiaggia bagnino , personale di servizio attenti e premurosi , bar con servizio in camera e piccola palestra . 
Camera stupenda spaziosa e con una vista da mozzafiato .
Bravi ma c'è da migliorare .",4,2017,07,11
05,Una conto al ristorante molto salato,"Ho soggiornato al Punta Molino durante il fine settimana lungo del 2 giugno.
Scrivo per raccontare quello che mi è accaduto .
Dopo aver trascorso la mattinata in maniera senza dubbio piacevole e rilassante tra la graziosa spiaggetta e il confortevole spazio della piscina con acqua termale decidiamo di mangiare qualcosa al bar esterno dell'albergo che guarda la piscina. Uno sguardo al menù e chiediamo consigli al cameriere che prontamente ci consiglia una grigliata di pesce non presente nella carta che ordiniamo in 2.
Nulla da ridire sulla qualità del prodotto ma al momento del conto la sorpresa!!!
160,00 euro la grigliata x 2!!!
Forse sono stato io leggero nel non chiedere quanto costasse ma il comportamento del cameriere nel non avvisarmi  è stato per me sicuramente poco onesto.",1,2017,07,04
05,....keine fünf Sterne!,"Der Empfang war leidlich freundlich, wir erhielten ein Zimmer im Haupthaus, ohne Balkon! Das Zimmer selber war zweckmäßig eingerichtet, genügend Schrankraum, Fächer und Schubladen! Das breite Bett komfortabel! Die Klimaanlage arbeitete leise und tadellos.
Das Bad sehr alt, schreckliches kleines Waschbecken, eine Duschwanne die nicht zeitgemäß ist! 
Das Zimmer wurde gut gereinigt.
Wir aßen einmal im Hotel abends, nicht bemerkenswert, eher lieblos!
Das Frühstück entspricht überhaupt nicht einem fünf Sterne Hotel, nachlässig angerichtetes Büfett, unsauber präsentiert. Das Rührei eine geschmacklose Masse aus dem Tetrapack! Die Servicekraft die für Spiegelei etc. zuständig war, unterhielt sich lieber mit den Kellnern.....
7 Tage Frühstück, keinerlei Abwechslung.
Das Servicepersonal welches für die Bar abends zuständig war, sehr aufmerksam, flink und freundlich.
Leider werden auch in diesem Hotel morgens die Liegen reserviert! Diese Liegen wurden oft den ganzen Tag nicht besetzt!
Die Hotelleitung sollte diese Unsitte endlich unterbinden, es ist den fünf Sternen absolut unwürdig.
Auch die Bevorzugung osteuropäischer Gäste empfanden wir seltsam.
Das Hotel ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen und benötigt dringend frischen Wind in der Hotelleitung!
Wir werden uns nach einem anderen fünf Sterne Hotel umschauen.....mit entsprechenden Service.

Piscina freddina esterna sicuramente molto comoda d'estate. Bagnino simpatico e molto efficiente.
Sicuramente una struttura perfetta per adulti in cerca di riposo non adatta per bambini.
Pasticceria di alta qualità, camere di media grandezza con gradevole mobilio.

La posizione è perfetta con un approdo sul mare utile per fare il bagno e prendere il sole, il panorama perfetto di fronte a Procida ed al Castello Aragonese, le terme efficienti e ben funzionanti così come la SPA, il cibo di ottimo livello con una particolare elogio per la pasticceria. Camere pulite, grandi e servite da ogni comfort. Personale gentile e sempre disponibile. Riuscire a piacere a 40 invitati abituati a viaggiare non è facile e non è cosa da poco. Il Punta Molino ci è riuscito. Abbiamo mangiato a colazione ed a cena, usato la SPA per i fanghi che vi consiglio previo consulto medico è fatto il bagno nelle piscine termali ed in ultimo usufruito dei consigli del personale per girare L isola e fare un po' di turismo. In considerazione che c'è stata anche un po' di pioggia si poteva chiedere di più?",5,2016,10,11
05,quando il personale fa la differenza,"Nonostante la struttura nn rispecchi totalmente la categoria di cui si fregia, la sua posizione strategica e il personale altamente qualificato fanno decisamente la differenza. Esaltante la qualita' del cibo. Un ringraziamento particolare allo staff del bar, ristorante e assistenza bagnati, punta di diamante della struttura(in particolare a Giorgio per la pazienza). Ci ritornero' sicuramente!",5,2016,10,09
05,"Un angolo di Paradiso, un mare di gentilezza","Sono stato ospite per due giorni in questa meravigliosa struttura. La pulizia, il decoro, la gentilezza del Personale arricchiscono un Hotel con l'acca maiuscola. Piscina coperta e scoperta, ampi spazi comuni, sauna e bagno turco, camere spaziose e illuminate. Over The Top.",5,2016,10,08
05,L'eccellenza esaltata dalla familiarità,"Sono stato ospite del Punta Molino purtroppo solo per pochi giorni.
In questo periodo io e la mia famiglia siamo stati letteralmente coccolati da tutto lo staff senza esclusione di nessuno.
La location assolutamente incantevole e il servizio di ristorazione eccellente hanno completato il quadro.
Lo stile, la professionalità e l'umanità con cui il Direttore Fulvio Gaglione gestisce l'intera struttura rende questo cinque stelle unico nel suo genere.

Consiglio assolutamente di soggiornarvi almeno una volta.",5,2016,10,05
05,Godersi Ischia in un contesto ideale,"E' stato veramente un piacere soggiornare una settimana al Grand hotel Punta Molino.
Ti senti a tuo agio fin dal primo momento del tuo arrivo fino alla fine al momento dlla partenza.
Il tutto agevolato da una posizione eccellente e strategica.
Il mare ti abbraccia appena fuori dalla struttura e ti accoglie con le premure dei bagnini sempre a tua disposizione.
Poi che dire del ristorante e del cibo di ottima qualita' e dei simpaticissimi e professionali capi sala cosi' come deggli addetti alla reception sempre disponibili a soddisfare le tue esigenze.
Infine un plauso al personale delle pulizie che non ti hanno mai fatto mancare nulla.
L'unica pecca riguarda forse le camere che avrebbero bisogno di un restiling ed in particolare i bagni che sarebbero da rinnovare",5,2016,10,04
05,Hotel perfetto,"E' un hotel perfetto sotto ogni punto di vista: posizione, accoglienza, ospitalità, ristorazione.

Insomma un albergo davvero unico!",5,2016,09,21
05,Sempre meglio,"Come nel titolo..... un doveroso grazie all'amico Ciro, il capo barman.

05,Vacanza al top,"Semplicemente divino, come al solito. Per chi è esigente questo Hotel è veramente speciale! Sono anni che lo frequentiamo, ogni volta ne rimaniamo estasiati sia per la sua invidiabile collocazione, sia per la gentilezza del personale, sia per i suoi servizi. Se rimodernassero anche i bagni nelle camere della Villa, sarebbe proprio veramente tutto ok!",5,2016,09,13
05,Ottimo tutto,"È sempre un piacere ritornare e ritrovare tutto sempre molto bello! Il Concierge, ma in generale tutto lo staff, sono fenomenali! Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo, nonostante la posizione e le possibilità della struttura.

05,"Posizione favolosa, hotel classico ed elegante","Ho soggiornato al Punta Molino per una settimana, avevo una stanza fronte mare al secondo piano, sopra la terrazza del ristorante.
L'hotel è collocato in una posizione invidiabile che offre una vista stupenda su Procida e sul Castello Aragonese, la struttura è molto bella, curata, molto classica ed elegante, le stanze sono arieggiate e luminose, la mia stanza era ampia, così come il bagno. L'hotel è immerso in un parco rigoglioso e curato dove è un piacere fare quattro passi o sedersi all'ombra dei pini marittimi.
Il servizio dell'hotel è eccellente, mi soffermo in particolare a lodare la gestione di spiaggia e piscine per la cura, pulizia, attenzione  e simpatia, lo stesso vale per il personale che lavora ai piani.
Purtroppo, con grande dispiacere, devo ammettere di non essere stata soddisfatta dalla cucina dell'hotel, non ho trovato l'offerta gastronomica all'altezza di un hotel a cinque stelle, per questo motivo non ho dato il massimo dei voti all'hotel. Avendo scelto come formula pernottamento e prima colazione, questo non ha inciso sulla riuscita della vacanza, ma mi sarebbe piaciuto trovare una ristorazione adeguata agli standard dell'hotel anche perchè il ristorante è situato su di una terrazza panoramica stupenda. 
Stanze molto confortevoli, cuscini super, molto silenziose (una volta finito l'intrattenimento del piano bar)
Nel complesso vacanza molto gradevole, tornerei sicuramente in questo albergo.",4,2016,09,07
05,Relax e Panorama incantevole,"Coppia. Location eccezionale per la bellezza della spiaggia, in posizione panoramica con bella veduta del castello, e la vicinanza al corso. Tre piscine di cui due termali ottime per il relax. Notevoli l'accoglienza e la gentilezza dello staff. Colazione ricca e varia a buffet con bella vista mare. Piacevole piano bar serale.",4,2016,08,31
05,Come al solito......stupendo!!!!!!!,"E' la sesta volta che abbiamo soggiornato presso questo hotel e come al solito siamo stati benissimo.
Tutto il personale è di altissima professionalità, gentile e disponibile.
A nostro parere la cucina è anche migliorata in confronto all'anno passato.
Per noi la posizione gli spazi ,la  tranquillità, le piscine ed il mare unitamente alle strutture messe a disposizione, sono quanto di meglio si può desiderare da un hotel.
Torneremo il prossimo anno !!",5,2016,08,30
05,Ischia al top,"Chi conosce Ischia è consapevole di dover fare i conti con una sgradevole scomodità: pochi metri di stabilimenti balneari in rapporto all'elevato numero di hotels, appartamenti e bed and breakfast.
Tutto ciò al Punta Molino non esiste.
La posizione dell'hotel è più unica che rara: grande struttura facilmente raggiungibile con tutti i mezzi a motore, immersa nel verde, corredata di tre piscine (quella termale a cielo aperto e quella coperta gratificherebbero anche il turista più incontentabile), un enorme terrazza dove poter consumare i pasti e perdersi alla vista di un panorama veramente incantevole (di fronte si vedono l'isola di Vivara e quella di Procida, mentre a destra si staglia la rocca che ospita il castello Aragonese), a tre minuti dal centro di Ischia porto e a 50 m (non sto scherzando sono veramente 50 m) dal mare.
Il servizio è di primissimo livello, le camere sono confortevoli e pulitissime ed il cibo di ottima qualità.
Per onestà bisogna però evidenziare due piccoli nei: mentre gli spazi comuni sono degni di una reggia, le camere sono un po' datate.
Una ventata di nuovo e di fresco agli interni degli alloggi ed al menù (anche questo un pelino sotto tono) porterebbe questo hotel all'eccellenza assoluta.",4,2016,08,29

05,praticamente perfetto,"l'albergo come location è meraviglioso, cosi' come il personale altamente qualificato, il direttore è super, la colazione ed il pranzo veramente eccezionali, inoltre da evidenziare la posizione assolutamente strategica in quanto è sulla spiaggia privata e pochissimi metri dalla piazzetta di ischia e dalla zona piu' bella dello shopping. praticamente tutto perfetto",5,2016,08,24
05,Semplicemente MERAVIGLIOSO!,"Fantastica la posizione, immerso in un parco ma a pochi passi dalla centralissima via Roma tra Ischia porto e Ischia ponte.

Discreta la scelta del menù colazione. Ottima la piscina termale, le diverse spiaggette sono piccole, non affollate e il mare è molto bello. Asciugamani morbidi, si può stare tutto il giorno in accappatoio! Molto molto bello",5,2016,08,23

Spiaggia curata dall occhio attento del bagnino Franco , impeccabile e disponibilissimo. Aria di magia e colori variopinti, relax puro . Esperienza personale fantastica, da ripetere . Di sicuro la struttura più valida e raffinata di Ischia Porto. Splendide piscine termali a completare la perfezione di questo hotel .

05,Grand hotel ischia,"L'albergo Punta Mulino si trova in un posto incantevole dell'isola di Ischia e quindi gode della vista del castello Aragonese, di Procida e tutto il golfo di Napoli.  I clienti hanno a disposizione una bellissima spiaggetta curata perfettamente dai bagnini persone molto gentili e simpatiche. In generale l'albergo è ben curato sia il parco, le piscine e tutte le parti comuni. Però da un hotel 5 stelle mi aspetto la perfezione e devo dire che la camera che ci hanno assegnato aveva qualche lacuna: macchie di muffa vicino alla griglia del condizionatore e ragnetti in alcuni punti della stanza. Peccato perché la camera è molto grande e con tutto quello che occorre per stare comodi. Inoltre il personale della reception è un po freddo e distaccato e poco propenso a dare indicazioni. Inoltre l'accesso al wi fi dell'albergo è consentito solo per 24h dopo che il personale ha consegnato utente e password, veramente una inutile complicazione. Comunque struttura bella che ci ha permesso di passare una piacevole vacanza,  ma mi sarei aspettato di meglio.",4,2016,08,10

05,Un albergo dove non ti senti mai solo un numero di camera,"Tornato anche quest'anno al punta molino l'albergo conferma le sue poche criticità (forse la struttura meriterebbe un restyling) ma anche i suoi molti meriti. Superata brillantemente una defezione nello staff della cucina ha comunque arricchito e completato la sua offerta pronto ad accontentare anche le mie richieste di cucina povera napoletana che mi riporta ai ricordi della mia infanzia. Reparto termale efficiente, beauty preparata sia pure in locali angusti, sala brillantemente gestita da Franco e dal suo rodato staff di collaboratori serata al piano bar in compagnia di Ciro e Sonia , pronti a soddisfare qualsiasi genere di richiesta, con drink magnificamente mixati da Ciro e dai suoi ragazzi, insostituibili nel soddisfare di giorno ogni languorino a qualsiasi ora. Ma la cosa più importante il vero valore aggiunto è quello di non sentirsi mai solo un numero di camera. Se a questo si aggiunge un puntuale servizio spiaggia è una location da sogno si capisce perché siamo qui tutti gli anni",5,2016,08,03
05,Tutto sommato esperienza positiva,"trovare un difetto al punta molino è come trovare un ago nel pagliaio...ma sfortunatamente un aghetto c era  ed e stata la pulizia della camera. Appena entrati in stanza il giorno di sant Anna, camera 103, e siamo arrivati quasi alle 18, abbiamo trovato capelli neri sulle lenzuola e 1 sul cuscino e una volta in bagno ne abbiamo trovati altri 2 sul pavimento: nerissimi e ne io ne mia moglie siamo scuri..anzi siamo tutte e due biondi...Ora o la camera è stata pulita superficialmente o l addetta alle stanze ha problemi di perdita di capelli...Li abbiamo eliminati noi senza fare troppo casini perchè non mi va di fare il rompipalle...Comunque un hotel di classe gentilezza del personale e piena disponibilita ad ogni tua esigenza..Devo fare i complimenti al metre che si è adoperato nel fsrci cenare la sera del 26 e per la sua gentilezza nel chiederci ogni poco se avessimo bisogno di qualcosa e se era tutto a posto.Anke i camerieri hanno uno standard professionale alto. In ultimo vorrei sottolineare come il direttore disponeva ordinava e organizzava il tutto personalmente con grande fervore e piglio...e questo è segno che ci tiene affinche tutto vada per il meglio e state sicuri che il risultato si vede",4,2016,07,31
05,Stupendo,"La location è stupenda, il giardino, il panorama, la spiaggia, le piscine, gli interni: tutto veramente bello. Il personale è estremamente cortese. Mi è veramente dispiaciuto dover ripartire. Mi sento però di dover dare un paio di consigli per migliorare ancora: 1) la colazione è buona, ma la varietà della scelta può essere ampliata ( non è all'altezza di tutto il resto). 2) al telefono mi era stato detto che avrei potuto portare il cane in spiaggia, ma quando sono arrivato mi è stato detto che si è trattato di un malinteso: curare la comunicazione. Inoltre, sarebbe stato carino un qualsiasi gesto per farsi perdonare.

Comunque sono stato benissimo e spero di tornarci.",5,2016,07,26
05,Consigliatissimo!,"Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel una sola notte ma ci è bastata per capire che vale veramente la pena alloggiare qui..l'hotel è molto bello ed ha una vista invidiabile sul castello aragonese..ma il vero punto di forza è lo staff.. Dai camerieri alla reception sono stati tutti molto professionali e gentilissimi. Ci hanno permesso di fare gratis il late check-out e di poter tenere la camera fino alle 16..poi ci hanno gentilmente prenotato la loro navetta per raggiungere il porto, anche questa gratis. Insomma veramente tutto perfetto. Consigliatissimo!",5,2016,07,23
05,Davvero un bel posto,"Il grand hotel punta molino si trova in una posizione fantastica a Ischia, a pochi minuti a piedi dalle vie dello shopping e proprio davanti a una spiaggia privata. Anche la piscina merita. Il personale gentilissimo. Da provare. La cucina è buonissima, i prezzi non bassi ma la qualità si sente!!",5,2016,07,16
05,finalmente corretta rispondenza con le stelle!,"La peggiore cosa che può capitare oggi che si prenota telematicamente e spesso senza riscontro è rimanere deluso nelle aspettative. Quando però prenoti un hotel 5 stelle  eti ritrovi ad essere soddisfatto e coccolato è il massimo! Perfetta come location, con spiaggia riservata, in zona a traffico controllato e centralissimo. Personale all'altezza di un 5 stelle, ristorante e varietà dei menù al top.",5,2016,07,14
05,Un'oasi di pace e ... gusto,"Sono ritornato con mia moglie ad un anno di distanza, certo di andare a colpo sicuro, essendoci trovati già bene nel Giugno 2015, quest'anno per festeggiare i 10 anni di matrimonio.
Ma quest'anno siamo stati ben felici di trovare addirittura miglioramenti, soprattutto dal punto di vista della cucina. Al precedente buffet a menu fisso (lunch) è stato infatti sostituita una carta di volta in volta diversa, con scelta tra 5 primi e 5 secondi.
Tutti di ottima fattura, senza dubbio alcuno.
La location (piscine termali e spiaggia privata in particolare) e la professionalità e serietà non invadente, mai ridondante, del personale hanno fatto tutto il resto. Uno fra tutti, ma non solo, mi preme ringraziare il signor Ciro che dirige con successo il Bar sulla terrazza: non solo meticoloso e simpatico, ma attento davvero a tutto, di quei rarissimi professionisti a cui non devi chiedere molto, perchè loro ti hanno capito e già sanno cosa intendi chiedere...perfetto!
Quando ritorneremo ad Ischia non faremo nessuna fatica nello scegliere l'hotel...
Grazie a tutti!",5,2016,07,05
05,Un'oasi di serenità,"Ottima la location con una spiaggia privata molto ben attrezzata ed appartata, non facile trovare ad Ischia Hotel con queste caratteristiche. Bella anche la zona piscine, dove è disponibile anche una vasca con acqua termale a 36 gradi. Personale molto efficiente e disponibile, avendo conosciuto sul luogo il Direttore è facile capire perchè. Buono e di qualità il cibo, con un menù vario ma semplice. Buono anche l'intrattenimento serale per gli ospiti con un bar attrezzato sulla terrazza. Grazie Punta Molino, apoteosi di un'isola fantastica.",5,2016,06,29
05,Un piccolo angolo di paradiso...,"In una cornice da sogno un luogo incantevole.
Sono stata nel mese di giugno con alcune amiche e devo dire che siamo state benissimo, il personale cordiale e capace è stato impeccabile e il ristorante offre un ampio menù con piatti buonissimi. 
La posizione è ottima e la spiaggia è da sogno, ci torneremo senz'altro!",5,2016,06,29
05,5 stelle di una volta....,"Sono stato con mia moglie e mio figlio piccolo a giugno...tutto bello: la camera, l'hotel, le piscine e il personale molto disponibile. Il ristorante presentava ottime portate  e i camerieri tutti molto gentili e professionali. L'hotel ha anche una piccola spiaggia privata (niente di esagerato essendo ovviamente ad Ischia ) dove poter accedere e fare il bagno in mare. Le 5 stelle però sono forse troppe se lo paragoniamo ai resort moderni: magari qualche anno fa potevano andar bene ma ad oggi sono esagerate e fanno salire il rapporto prezzo/qualità. Una nota negativa riguarda l'accessibilità ai vari ambienti per chi ha la carrozzina o passeggino: a mio parere l'hotel non è adatto in quanto sia per prendere l'ascensore sia per andare in piscina dovevamo fare delle scale che ci costringevano sempre a prendere il passeggino in braccio o a chiedere aiuto! A parte questa nota siamo stati molto bene e all'insegna del relax!",4,2016,06,27
05,Un tre stelle,"Sono stata in questo albergo per un micro viaggio di nozze. Parto subito dalle cose che mi sono piaciute:
L'hotel ha degli spazi esterni molto belli e curati, con un piccolo parco e giadinetti molto molto carini. Ci sono ben tre piscine,  di cui una termale al chiuso di cui ho  usufruito diverse volte senza problemi. Poi è  molto panoramico e possiede una spiaggia privata, piccola ma confortevole. Il servizio ai tavoli della spiaggia funziona molto bene. Buono e puntuale. Il ristorante non è male, ha un buffet molto fornito al punto che si potrebbe evitare anche di ordinare. Fanno un'ottima creme brulee, servita insieme ad altri dolci al buffet.
Ma non è un cinque stelle. Purtroppo il servizio pulizia in camera è stato pessimo. Non ho voglia di andare nello specifico, ma lo abbiamo fatto presente e subito ci sono venuti a pulire il bagno trovato sporco. Ma non basta. Sono stati molto carini a offrirci spumante e frutta in camera, ma li hanno lasciati li per tre giorni insomma...chi berrebbe spumante aperto da qualche giorno immerso in un secchiello pieno di acqua? Ho da ridire anche sul modo di rifare il letto sinceramente..molto superficiale. Termino aggiungendo che, quando abbiamo avuto il problema del bagno sporco, per ben due volte la cameriera è venuta a bussare per sapere se andava tutto bene. Peccato che una delle due volte stavo riposando e sono stata svegliata. Erano circa le 20. La persona fuori alla porta non l'abbiamo ovviamente fatta entrare ma ha obiettato che avremmo dovuto mettere il non disturbare fuori la porta. Scherziamo? Io credo che come minimo avrebbero dovuto prima avvertirci via telefono e poi mandarla da noi..
Insomma devono a mio avviso migliorare e controllare l'operato dei camerieri al piano..perché così non è un cinque stelle. Non basta avere Sky, Premium, aria condizionata..",3,2016,06,21
05,un posto di sogno,"Abbiamo passato una settimana favolosa. L'albergo è splendido, il personale attento e sorridente,  il ristorante gastronomico, il servizio perfetto. Abbiamo apprezzato le due piscine termali e il mare vicinissimo, il giardino su cui dava la nostra camera. Una sola cosa è meno piacevole, è il numero di transat vicino al mare insufficente il più delle volte. E da notare tuttavia la grande disponibilità di quelli che si occupano della gestione dei posti liberi e fanno di tutto per soddisfare i clienti.
grazie mille a tutti !",5,2016,06,19

Le camere vista mare sono molto valide, rimodernate di recente, pur mantenendo il fascino di un tempo, come ad esempio gli splendidi pavimenti.
Abbiamo molto apprezzato che, nonostante si fosse prenotata una camera con vista giardino, la direzione, avendone la disponibilità, ci ha dato una bellissima camera con una splendida vista mare senza alcun sovraprezzo.
Locali comuni all'altezza delle 5 stelle, spettacolare il terrazzo fronte mare dove viene servitala colazione.

Graditissimo il buffet della prima colazione, molto vario sia nel dolce che nel salato, il tutto servito su una terrazza panoramica, fronte mare. La cucina eccellente, cibi di qualità realizzati con maestria, solo per due volte ordinando la carne di manzo ho ritenuto non fosse al livello qualitativo con tutto il resto. E cosa dire del cocktail party? Organizzato e offerto dal General Manager, Dr. Fulvio Gaglione, sulla terrazza panoramica con piano bar, dove due maestri professionisti si sono esibiti eseguendo melodie del passato.
Si tornerò con la mia signora per una prossima futura vacanza.",5,2015,09,27
05,Vacanza estiva ad Ischia ,"Sono anni che frequento il Punta Molino ad Ischia ed è il solo motivo per cui continuo a frequentare un isola che amo. L'albergo è ottimo e l'accoglienza eccellente. Un segno particolare alla cucina ed al ""molo' su cui trascorro le mie giornate al sole ",5,2015,09,13
05,Da ritornarci!,"Ottima location.. Per una vacanza in pieno relax tra un tuffo in mare e in piscina, da scegliere tra termale e non. Eccellente e attento il servizio. Camere sempre pulite e in ordine. Squisite ed abbondanti le pietanze , ogni giorno diverse per soddisfare ogni palato, per concludere con la scelta dei vari dolci e frutta di stagione! Il buffet della colazione molto ricco, italiano e internazionale. Bar e ristorante da cui ammirare la romantica vista del castello aragonese. Sicuramente ci ritorneremo! ",5,2015,09,05
05,Molto delusa ....dopo tanti anni!,"Dopo oltre 6 anni di bellissime vacanze, la struttura è sempre unica e la location magnifica. Peccato che la proprietà abbia una pessima direzione ormai da due o tre anni. Comunque il mare è bellissimo, le terme - seppur obsolete - (il pomeriggio dovrebbero essere aperte come al Regina Isabella) hanno il loro fascino. Soprattutto un grande grazie al Dr. William Esposito (osteopata) alla sig.ra Antonietta detta anche ""maga dei fanghi a colori"" e all'infaticabile Sig. Franco che assiste tutti in spiaggia sempre con il sorriso. Ottimo il concierge (Sig. Ciro) anche se... Troviamo risibile il fatto di aver prenotato per tempo e aver pagato una cifra molto alta quando poi all'ultimo minuto persone nostre vicine di camera avevano pagato la metà. Clientela ""agostana"" davvero pessima. Buona la prima colazione fino al 20 agosto. Poi...media. Pessima la restante ristorazione. Il migliore asset? Il fisioterapista e osteopata W. Esposito",3,2015,09,04
05,Vero relax!!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato dal 24 al 28/08/15 ed è stata la quarta volta che siamo 
stati in questo hotel sinonimo di tranquillità e pace situato in posizione panoramica
con davanti l'isola di Procida. Come le altre volte ci siamo trovati benissimo, la 
camera 412 spaziosa, luminosa, silenziosa, adatte alle nostre esigenze.
La pulizie della stessa non è in discussione, tutto il personale si è dimostrato
gentilissimo e  disponibile. I pasti sono stati sempre di ottima qualità ed abbondanti
serviti con professionalità .
Molto gradita la"" sera d'estate"" iniziata con aperitivo , seguito da un ricco e buonissimo

05,"Hotel di tre stelle, se ti lamenti il proprietari ti caccia, incredibile.......","Inadeguato per essere un hotel a 5 stelle. Vecchio, polveroso e buio. 
Letti e materassi da B&B, sono alto 1,85 i miei piedi uscivano fuori dal letto, impianto elettrico che risale agli anni 70, piscine piccolissime, lettini posizionati a cm 5 uno dall'altro anche in spiaggia, tutto mi ha dato un senso di oppressione. Insomma un hotel di 3 stelle con prezzi da 5 stelle. Attenzione se provate a lamentarvi il proprietario vi minaccia di cacciarvi dall'hotel invitandovi prima a pagare e poi ad andare via.  Incredibile..........ma mi è capitato......
Uniche note positive personale molto gentile cucina buona.",2,2015,08,17
05,Ottimo livello in tutti gli aspetti.,"Davvero un 5 stelle. Poco da aggiungere. Bella la spiaggia con servizio curato e cortese. Ottime le piscine, termali e non. Da migliorare forse la palestra e la qualità di qualche piatto al bel ristorante panoramico. ",5,2015,08,16

Prima esperienza per noi in questa struttura e sentendo altri ospiti che abbiamo conosciuto mi dicono che quest anno é salito di livello rispetto agli anni passati . Penso che il merito di tutto ciò è attribuito al nuovo direttore che gestisce da quest anno che è sempre sul pezzo dalla mattina alla sera TARDI . Complimenti ",5,2015,08,11
05,Sono stato d'incanto,Ho passato qualche giorno presso questa struttura dove mi sono rilassato davvero. Posizione ottima e soprattutto strategica. Vicino  al corso principale di Ischia Porto è direttamente collegata alla spiaggia. Ho goduto di tranquillità e di tanta gentilezza del personale.

Non mi ripeto su questo vorrei solo aggiungere i vertici raggiunti dalla cucina dove emerge un trionfo di odori e sapori della isola degno di menzione da parte delle guide più qualificate e la professionalità del personale del centro termale che ti coccola dal momento in cui entri a quando vai via.

E' stata una scelta ancora una volta azzeccata. Abbiamo trascorso una settimana a dir poco meravigliosa. Le piscine e l'area a mare dell'hotel sono ben attrezzate e ben presidiate. Le camere offrono un buon confort e la pulizia e' buona. La colazione e la cena sono servite su una terrazza con una vista unica sul mare. L'abbondanza, la varieta' e la qualita' del cibo sono uniche. Personale con buona professionalita'. La sala ristorante e' presidiata dai Sigg. Mazzella e Di Meglio. due veri professionisti. Il costo in linea con quello che ti viene offerto ma quando parti non vedi l'ora di ritornare.",5,2015,07,19

05,Ri-ri-riconferma,"Siamo tornati anche quest'anno (terzo/consecutivo) ed abbiamo sfruttato appieno tutte le opportunità che questa veramente molto bella struttura offre (soprattutto spiaggia e piscine, complice il tempo magnifico)!

Camera classic carina dotata di accappatoio e ciabatte, però hanno ancora la classica chiave pesantissima. Colazione fantastica fornitissima. La cosa meno esaltante è stata la piscina interna, si può fare di più. Quando eravamo li c'è stato un  matrimonio, siamo stati avvisati il giorno prima con un comunicato in camera, non hanno disturbato tanto.",5,2015,07,09
05,Terme insufficienti,"Posizione strategica, sulla scogliera di Ischia porto, a dieci minuti (a piedi) dal cuore della cittadina. Non ci ha particolarmente impressionato. Come altri 5 stelle realizzati  molti anni fa, vive un po' di rendita. Non ci sono sembrate sufficienti le piscine termali. Abbastanza ampia quella interna, ma troppo piccola quella esterna: se uno viene a Ischia perchè (come è probabile) ama il termalismo, potrebbe rimanere deluso.",3,2015,07,06
05,Quattro giorni ad Ischia,"Quattro splendidi giorni trascorsi in un albergo fantastico. Il personale è professionale ed affabile.

L'hotel si trova a pochi passi dal centro pedonale di ischia e a due minuti dalla riva destra e dal castello aragonese..

Non posso non dedicare la mia recensione alla persona che grazie alla sua grande professionalita' ha reso tutto questo possibile. Il ringraziamento speciale va a Ciro Lauro, il concierge dell'hotel, il quale rendera' i vostri soggiorni sempre piu' piacevoli.

Un saluto va anche al signor Franco della spiaggia, al maitre, e non ultimo al direttore che riesce a coordinare il tutto, Dott. Fulvio Gaglione.

A presto,

05,Un matrimonio ..qui,"Ottima posizione, location suggestiva e molto elegante. Ci sono stata per una cerimonia e devo dire che tutto è' stato impeccabile. Merito degli sposi nell'aver scelto questo posto ma anche di essersi affidati a mani esperte. Gli sposi hanno scelto un ricco buffet a isole, servito all'esterno, dove tutto era presentato con raffinatezza, dai crudi, sushi, fritturine, finger di ogni genere,formaggi, salumi, un tripudio di gusti. Tutto freschissimo e di ottima qualità. Ma quello che ho notato e' stato il personale molto attento ed efficiente dall'inizio alla fine ...e i tempi che sono stati perfetti. 
Per la cena ci siamo accomodati nella sala interna, molto spaziosa e con vista panoramica mozzafiato. Anche qui piatti eccellenti come i vini degustati. In ultimo buffet di dolci ... Di ogni tipo tutti buonissimi, ma quello che ho trovato delizioso, la piccola tazzina di cioccolato con all'interno il tiramisù ! 
Wedding cake chicchissima con decorazione di peonie. Confettata elegante, e favoloso angolo con sigari e rhum per i signori. Tutto molto curato nei dettagli.. Fuochi d'artificio per chiudere in bellezza. Posto incantevole consigliatissimo!!! ",5,2015,06,15

05,ottimo per molti aspetti,"ottimo per la posizione, con chiari di luna sul castello impareggiabili; ottimo per tutto il personale che ci lavora, di una cortesia e disponibilità non sempre facili da trovare; ottimo per la cucina (e per fortuna che poi si suda sotto un fango rigeneratore e le coccole dell'impareggiabile Antonietta).

05,Vacanze ad Ischia svago e cure,"Sono stata in questa splendida struttura per una vacanza con mia madre, abbiamo abbinato al relax le cure termali, siamo entusiaste dell'hotel, ci torniamo da anni.
La struttura ha una posizione unica sul mare con vista sul castello Aragonese nel borgo vecchio di Ischia ponte e vicinissima al centro, non mi dilungherò nella descrizione dell' hotel o del centro benessere che offrono ai clienti veramente moltissimo, le foto sul sito sono eloquenti e reali, questo albergo offre servizi eccellenti, ma quello che più abbiamo apprezzato e su cui vorrei soffermarmi è l'estrema cortesia, sempre discreta, ma attenta ai bisogni dei clienti di tutti a partire dalla  reception, al personale di sala, ai barman, un grazie di cuore va a tutti loro ed al nuovo direttore, gentilissimo e molto attento ai suggerimenti della clientela, per aver reso davvero unico il nostro soggiorno.

05,un ritorno felice e finalmente ai vecchi fasti,"Sono ritornato per una breve vacanza all'hotel Punta Molino di Ischia e subito ho avvertito quell'atmosfera gioiosa e molto galante che mancava da un pò di tempo.Son ritornato dopo due anni in questa struttura e l'ultima volta ne ero rimasto deluso poichè l'ambiente e l'atmosfera non era di quelle che di solito si vuole trovare in location a 5 stelle e molto esclusive.Stavolta invece ho constatato l'entusiasmo e la disponibilità del personale tutto a partire dalla reception.Un complimento particolare al personale di sala magistralmente guidato dai maitres che con molta classe ed eleganza,si sanno porgere ai cliente soddisfacendo ogni  sua richiesta.Un plauso al nuovo Direttore Fulvio Gaglione che ha saputo ridare all'hotel il vecchio splendore degli anni passati e di cui ne ho molto apprezzato la professionalità,il sorriso sempre pronto e la discreta disponibilità nell'essere sempre presente per rendere il soggiorno quanto più gradito.Per quanto riguarda l'hotel resta sempre una favola per la sua posizione che abbraccia tutto il golfo di Napoli fino ai confini con il Lazio,un parco meraviglioso pieno di essenze vegetali ben tenute e con arbusti secolari,La cucina è di altissimo livello,la pulizia delle camere 2 volte al giorno è di una cura eccezionale.La struttura offre un ampio parcheggio all'interno del parco ed offre, all'occasione, una navetta per i trasporti da / e per il porto.Si può godere di un centro benessere con proprie terme e piscine con acque termali calde e fredde a disposizione della clientela.La struttura si completa con una spiaggia privata che naturalmente si avvale di personale all'altezza della situazione e sempre disponibile alle esigenze della clientela.Il rapporto prezzo qualità è davvero eccellente.",5,2015,06,03
05,SPETTACOLARE,"La posizione della struttura e' notevole, affacciata sul mare e a 2 passi dal Centro di Ischia Porto.Spiaggia privata dotata di tutti i comfort. Bellissimo e molto curato il parco/giardino. Ottima la colazione con un ricco buffet di dolci e salato. Molto bella e confortevole  la camera con vista mare, silenziosa e molto pulita. Le piscine sono termali sempre dotate di ogni comfort. Ma la vera eccellenza di questo 5 stelle e' tutto lo staff, ci siamo sentiti coccolati e benvenuti. Complimenti torneremo con grande piacere.",5,2015,06,03
05,Ottimo,"Location perfetta perche vicino al corso, al porto e Ischia ponte quindi solo camminando si riescono a vedere e vivere contesti diversi. Panorama bellissimo e discesa al mare comodo e a 20 metri dall'albergo. 
Ristorante ottimo, ingredienti freschi e menu vario. Molto pulito e tutto, compreso il caffe' viene servito coperto per evitare che si freddi e che vi possano andare elementi esterni. 
Servizio perfetto, cortesia e disponibilita'. Lo stile dell'albergo unisce l'eleganza dei tempi passati con linee moderne anni 70 con gusto.
Unico neo forse rivedrei lo stile e la disposizione della spa e piscina coperta. Necessitano un aggiornamento.
Ma l'isola e' un centro benessere a cielo aperto con acque termali e mari quindi non serve neanche tanto la spa.
Il prezzo e' giusto per la qualita' della vacanza che si fa in una location simile.",5,2015,06,02
05,GRANDE RELAX - GRANDE ALBERGO - GRANDE SERVIZIO,"Ottimo albergo, posizionato sul mare, fra il porto ed il promontorio del CASTELLO ARAGONESE circondato da un giardino curatissimo e rigoglioso.
Servizio impeccabile sia nell'hotel che nel ristorante; personale gentile, professionale e disponibile alle esigenze del cliente!!!!
Molto apprezzato l'up-grade di sistemazione che a sorpresa ci è stato riservato; la camera era veramente magnifica con vista mare da SOGNO!!!
Cibo di alta qualità sia nella colazione che nella cena serale.
Buone le piscine termali, sia esterna che interna; palestra da migliorare nella ubicazione e nella manutenzione dell'attrezzatura.

Ciro l'autista ci ha accolto all'arrivo dell'aliscafo ed in 10 minuti siamo arrivati al Punta Molino. Camera alle 12 già pronta ,una  camera standard vista parco, sapevamo di voler spendere più tempo possibile sulla spiaggia o in piscina termale anche coperta  ..tende colorate e maiolica nel bagno.

Stupendo in tutto dalla ricca colazione all'aperto con vista sul mare e piscina alla cena ..super abbondante e dolci fati dal proprio pasticciere...buonissimi.

Personale sempre disponibile e cordiale ...forse qualche telo da mare in più....

Devo dire che il direttore era sempre presente..poverino giacca e cravatta..molto disponibile con tutti

05,Scarissimo...,"Albergo che si fregia delle 5 stelle con molto demerito...abbiamo girato molto sia per lavoro sia per svago ed il trattamento ricevuto in questa struttura assomiglia più a quello di un 3* che 5!
Al ceck inn assurdo abbiamo portato pesanti bagagli su per le scale...stanza al primo piano, rumorosa vecchia e danneggiata, lo scarico era rotto(la plastica) e le tende rovinate(facendo passare la luce non aiutavano la qualità del sonno) e la cassaforte in un solo giorno è andata in tilt tre volte).
Prezzo esorbitante per una struttura simile, personale inadeguato.
Non ritornerei e non lo consiglierei a nessuno.",1,2015,05,31

05,Serekiko,"L'unica cosa da dire è che quando si raggiungono così alti livelli di customer care, il rischio che si corre è quello di peggiorare. Sono invece convinto che tutte le professionalità che ho riscontrato nel  mio soggiorno in questa splendida struttura, riusciranno a mantenere l'elevatissimo standard che ho trovaato.
BRAVI TUTTI, di sicuro ritornerò.",5,2015,05,20
05,il migliore,"Senza dubbio il migliore per posizione e qualità del servizio offerto.
Piscine termali, centro benessere, camere spaziose, grande parco con accesso diretto al mare sono solo alcune delle prerogative.
Indimenticabile la colazione sulla terrazza sul mare",5,2015,05,17
05,sopravvalutato,"L'hotel è immerso nel verde. La struttura è ben tenuta e il verde è rigoglioso e stupendo. Il personale è gentile. La nostra standard era pulita tranne per il comodino pieno di polvere. abbiamo pernottato per due notti. il mio ragazzo alto 1.85 non entrava nel letto.. (misura standard di 1.80m a detta loro.) Quando abbiamo chiesto di avere un letto un po piu grande , ci hanno risposto che la misura è standard. la nostra stanza era piena di formiche.. e quando l'abbiamo fatto presente ci hanno immediatamente dato un altra camera sempre standard ma con vista mare. molto bella, ma con una lampadina rotta. Fatto presente anche questo... ce l'hanno immediatamente aggiustata. Bene, anche se sono stati disponibili su tutto, ritengo che un 5 stelle non possa permettersi queste sviste, soprattutto per quello che costa. la colazione molto buona e varia.",3,2015,05,04
05,SEMPLICEMENTE FANTASTICO,"Siamo tornati ieri dal Punta  Molino: solitamente non mi dilungo nelle recensioni, esprimo pochi concetti chiari; in questo caso non posso che investire del tempo per descrivere i servizi della struttura,  tutti eccellenti 
Dall'arrivo dove Ciro ci racconta in  5 minuti la bellezza dell'isola, all'accoglienza alla hall di Giampiero e Daniela.
La camera che ci hanno assegnato aveva vista mare, molto tranquilla e silenziosa.
Le piscine, sia quella interna che le due esterne sono curate e ben tenute.
La piccola spa dispone di sauna, palestra e zona relax.
La vera sorpresa l'abbiamo avuta per cena: il personale di sala, Salvatore, Francesco Gennaro e Franco ci hanno coccolato come persone di famiglia: la cucina e' di elevato livello, cosi' la pasticceria.
Dopo cena si viene accolti da Ciro e Giorgio al piano bar che curano nei minimi dettagli il servizio.
Non posso che ringraziare il direttore della struttura che ci ha fatto veramente sentire a casa.
Credo che torneremo presto in questo hotel, poche volte nelle mie vacanze sono stato cosi' bene.",5,2015,05,02

05,Dopo anni in cui ci andavo con la famiglia... GRANDISSIMA DELUSIONE!!!,"Premetto che è da quando frequentavo le elementari che puntualmente ogni estate la mia famiglia ed io soggiorniamo presso questa struttura. Capisco che ci sia stato un cambio ai vertici nella dirigenza dell'hotel ma, purtroppo, con grande dispiacere e con immenso rammarico devo dire che ci siamo trovati decisamente male. Abbiamo soggiornato 10 giorni nel periodo di ferragosto (dato i miei numerosi impegni trovo un minuto libero solo ora per scrivere ma ci tengo davvero tanto far sapere la nostra grandissima delusione...). Non appena siamo arrivati non abbiamo più sentito quel calore mediterraneo che da sempre contraddistingueva la struttura. Alla reception molto freddi e devo dire alcuni membri piuttosto poco pratici nel loro mestiere tanto che mio padre ha dovuto subito mettere in chiaro alcune cose. Meno male che qualcuno della ""vecchia guardia"" è rimasto perché altrimenti... Per non far mancare nulla, quest'estate non ci sono state assegnate nemmeno le stanze che avevamo richiesto... le solite di una vita tra l'altro!!! Io e la mia ragazza abbiamo dormito per le prime notti in una camera che non è definibile nemmeno per un hotel 5 stelle! Il fiore all'occhiello dell'albergo era la cucina... dico ""era"" purtroppo perché le leccornie che venivano cucinate e il sapore di quei piatti avrebbe mandato in estasi persino il più scettico! Ora, tutto il contrario tant'è che tutti noi abbiamo avuto, per la prima volta in tutti questi anni, qualche problemino di stomaco! Un esempio: alla sera credo proprio che non ci siamo nemmeno ritrovati a mangiare pesce fresco ma surgelato... non sono un grande esperto ma dal sapore e dal modo in cui era tagliato lasciava presagire soltanto una cosa simile! Per di più i vari accorgimenti come per esempio cameriere che sfilettava il pesce oppure i primi piatti che venivano serviti direttamente al momento, li possiamo solo mantenere vivi nei ricordi e tanto più le quantità di una volta! Risulta tutto più veloce e spiccio.
Io ho 26 anni, sono giovane, è vero, ma già a questa età sono un docente di italiano e storia. Con questo non voglio elogiarmi assolutamente ma è solo per far capire che vorrei anche non essere stato trattato come un ragazzino alle prime armi o che non poteva permettersi nemmeno di comprare una bottiglia d'acqua quando soltanto qualche anno fa mi sentivo davvero come a casa mia. Non dimenticherò mai quei periodi come del resto tutta la mia famiglia e la mia ragazza la quale è rimasta scioccata dalla drastica involuzione. Detto ciò spero che ai piani alti qualcuno possa prendere qualche accorgimento e imparare da coloro che c'erano prima perché, a mio parere, erano impeccabili! Ischia mi ha cresciuto e mi rimarrà sempre nel cuore ma credo proprio che dall'anno prossimo, dopo più di 15 anni cambieremo struttura... ahimé con grandissimo malincuore! Evidentemente si predilige la clientela russa per svariati motivi...
Non vorrei fare di tutta l'erba un fascio poiché l'unico posto in cui veramente non ho trovato riscontri negativi è la spiaggia. Del resto i bagnini ci sono da una vita e sanno come far stare bene i clienti!",2,2015,01,13
05,SPLENDIDO ma...migliorabile!!,"Ho trascorso in questo hotel un bellissimo fine settimana di settembre. L'hotel ha una posizione  eccezionale, panoramica, immersa nel verde ma a pochi passi dal corso principale. La struttura è veramente bella e ben curata, offre una buona accoglienza, piscine e spiaggia privata con vista sul castello aragonese. La colazione è servita nella terrazza sul mare con buffet strepitoso e ottimo servizio da parte del personale. Unico neo, che mi impedisce di dare la valutazione massima che fin qui meriterebbe, è stata la sistemazione in camera situata al di fuori del corpo centrale. La camera era poco spaziosa, con servizi molto datati e vasca da bagno malfunzionante. Piuttosto deludente rispetto al resto della struttura e sicuramente non all'altezza di 5 stelle, a mio avviso nemmeno di 4...",4,2014,10,07
05,Un bellissimo fine settimana di Settembre,"Ho passato qui un bellissimo fine settimana con mia moglie.

05,Bellissimo,"Ho trascorso un wend di giugno in quwsto bell'albergo dove e' tutto ben curato e il personale e' attento nel soddiafare le le varie esigenze. L'albergo ha un bel pontile sul mare dove prendere il sole cullati dalle onde, una piccola piscina termale e una di acqua dolce che circonda la struttura. Il ristorante offre pietanze di buona qualita con buffet di antipasti e dolci. Non ho dato il punteggio massimo perche' la colazione e' da migliorare soprattutto la cornetteria e i muffin congelati e crudi (invece la parte salata e' ottima ma come sappiamo noi italiani nob ne facciamo  uso)",4,2014,09,16
05,Tutto al top,"Bellissima esperienza, siamo stati destinati a quest'albergo per pura caso, poiché gli altri erano pieni, ed abbiamo poi scoperto, a ragion veduta, essere il migliore di Ischia, e per noi uno dei migliori visitato in assoluto.....Personale, preparato a qualsiasi esigenza, disponibile e sorridente, camera scelta una junior suite new stile, bellissima, pulitissima e arredata con vero gusto anche nei minimi particolari.....cosa mai vista negli altri hotel, veniva addirittura pulita due volte al giorno, un oasi di pace e relax......cucina sia a pranzo che a cena di alta qualità.....Che dire di più????

La stanza standard vista mare è stata una sorpresa davvero uno spettacolo, un week end indimenticabile grazie a tutto lo staff dell'albergo.

Ma cio' che fa di questo hotel il top è il personale, gentile professionale perfetto a partire da Gianpiero disponibile a qualsiasi richiesta ,che ci ha fatto gradita sorpresa regalandoci 2 notti in una camera fantastica.Ringrazio Luisa, i bagnini efficientissimi e simpatici come Raffaele. Se volete un massaggio terapeutico fatto da un vero esperto c'è William e le estetiste sono fantastiche. La sera poi si mangia benissimo cucina di alto livello e poi piano bar in totale relax. Tutto questo ha reso la nostra vacanza perfetta uno dei migliori hotel in cui sia stata e faccio i complimenti a tutti per l'ospitalità con cui ci avete accolto la vostra simpatia e disponibilità fa davvero la differenza.Torneremo presto un caro saluto a tutto lo staff  Complimenti",5,2014,09,03
05,Un  Paradiso Terrestre,"L'unica cosa negativa che ho soggiornato solo un week-end.... avrei preferito fare una settimana se non di piu. Ho soggiornato con il mio ragazzo e ci siamo trovati benissimo. Una stanza( che non chiamerei tale visto le dimensioni) strepitosa, non mancava nulla , anche il bagno molto bello e pulito.

05,""" Incantevole sorpresa ""","La meta era un'altra ma, la nostra buona stella , ci ha condotto a scegliere il Punta Molino...Soggiornare in questo Hotel é stata un'incantevole esperienza che consiglio a chiunque decida di concedersi due coccole e di farsi viziare in una struttura deliziosa, ottimamente tenuta e gestita, con un servizio eccellente, discreto ed attento alle esigenze dei suoi ospiti. Posizione da favola, direttamente sulla spiaggia privata ma a due passi dalla via principale. La vista dalla piscina, dalla terrazza é impagabile..... da togliere il fiato.  Si mangia in maniera divina con un servizio impeccabile. Cortesia, attenzione al particolare, uno staff efficiente, altamente professionale, pronto ad assecondare le esigenze degli ospiti con grande disponibilità, discrezione ed un sorriso contagioso nonostante i ritmi dell'alta stagione.

05,L'Hotel   PUNTA MOLINO  * * * * * * * * * *  un firmamento intero,"Siamo ritornati al PUNTA MOLINO perchè ne avevamo un ottimo ricordo e non ci sbagliavamo. Questa volta la vacanza è durata una settimana, rientrando a malincuore ieri sera. Ho ancora negli occhi e nel cuore, ciò che molti non sanno aprrezzre, perchè distratti, superficiali o perchè no, un pò viziati e con la puzza sotto al naso da finti snob. Considerazioni che faccio dopo aver letto 1 solo giudizio di chi non sa apprezzare il bello ed il buono.  L'Hotel PUNTA MOLINO  è una garanzia di professionalità ed efficienza e colpisce per la cortesia e l'eleganza del personale che, anche se stanchi per le ore piccole notturne, sono velocissimi  nel realizzare e ad esaudire ogni desiderio degli ospiti. Le coccole non si contano, dalla frutta in camera all'accoglienza, ai cioccolatini con il meteo nel pomeriggio, cambio biancheria giornaliero,ed il caffè in camera al mattino con una rosa.Panorama mozzafiato,pulizia ,igiene ed una notevole varietà gastronomica serviteci con savoir faire ,sotto le campane per non disperdere il calore delle pietanze, sapientemente scoperte all'unisono per tutti i commensali. Queste sono raffinatezze ben seguite e controllate sia dal 1° maitre che dal 2°, sempre vigili ed attenti. Sul posto vivono i proprietari che con occhio discreto fanno in modo che il tutto funzioni a meraviglia, dai bagnini della spiaggia, a tutto il personale ed alla réception che si avvale di  persone davvero speciali. Ringrazio pubblicamente gli artisti Ciro e Sonia che ogni sera ci hanno deliziato con le loro musiche ma ,soprattutto, con le loro voci melodiose..Grazie per aver organizzato una mostra di quadri di artisti emergenti, di cui ho potuto apprezzare il genio di Marco Chiuchiarelli. Grazie per l'elegante e raffinata serata organizzata da tutto lo staff  per il ferragosto  ***Ritorneremo sicuramente, sia per il posto ,che merita davvero un applauso ,ma perchè il calore e la simpatia di chi ci lavora è spontanea e contagiosa.. Si può mentire per 1 ora, un giorno ma non per una settimana intera. Ve lo garantisco! Maria Riccio Luongo",5,2014,08,19
05,Una conferma dell'eccellenza italiana nella ospitalità,"Tornato dopo un anno al Punta Molino ho ritrovato, oltre ovviamente all'unicità della posizione, la abituale calda accoglienza da parte di tutto lo staff dell'albergo.
Indimenticabile cena di ferragosto, in assoluto uno dei menù meglio riusciti che io abbia mangiato in vita mia (magari fosse stato presente qualche ispettore della Michelin). Ottima l'impronta della nuova direzione che ha esteso la copertura Wi fi (di cui mi ero lamentato nella precedente recensione) anche alla zona delle piscine e della spiaggia e ha attivato ogni sera la cena all'aperta nella splendida terrazza sul golfo di Napoli.
La posizione dell'albergo e la perfetta funzionalità di ogni settore, dalle terme al bar sulla terrazza (da provare assolutamente i drinks di Ciro) alla sala ristorante che gira come un orologio compensa ampiamente qualche piccolo problema della struttura che inizia a sentire l'esigenza di qualche intervento",5,2014,08,18
05,Ottimo!!,"Sono stato in questo Hotel cinque stelle nella settimana di ferragosto. È una struttura molto curata e di dimensioni non eccessive. La camera aveva una finestra che rendeva il Castello Aragonese in camera. Ottimo il servizio con personale molto gentile e professionale. Buona anche la cucina con adeguata scelta di pietanze. Ci sono due piscine esterne, una delle quali con acqua termale a 35 gradi ed una, ugualmente termale, interna.
La spiaggia è piccola - come tutte in questa zona dell'isola- ma molto ordinata e prospiciente l'albergo. A piedi in due minuti potrete essere nella strada pedonale più importante fina Ischia Porto.",5,2014,08,16
05,Favoloso!,"Struttura stupenda in una posizione perfetta. A due passi dal centro di Ischia Porto e vicinissima al mare. Ambienti molto curati. Stanze silenziose e pulitissime. Il valore aggiunto di questo hotel sta nella professionalità e nella cortesia di tutto il personale, in particolare di Ciro, responsabile dell'area bar. Ci tornerò sicuramente!",5,2014,07,17
05,Fantastico,"Servizi ottimi, camere favolose, ottima ubicazione.
Se dovessi ritornare ad Ischia ritornerei sicuramente all' Hotel punta molino... Un holtel eccellente dove ci si può rilassare e allo stesso tempo essere in soli 2 minuti al centro di Ischia. Il personale molto professionale e gentile ed inoltre ho riscontrato un ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo",5,2014,07,15
05,Relax e coccole,"Siamo rientrati da pochi giorni e già sentiamo nostalgia! 
Alla nostra terza esperienza al Grand Hotel Punta Molino possiamo dire che la qualità non è variata! 
La nostra stanza, pulitissima, vista parco ci ha permesso di riposare in tranquillità, la colazione abbondante e varia ci ha coccollati fin dal mattino per proseguire durante la giornata con la piscina termale, quella normale, i massaggi eseguiti da personale espertissimo, la spiaggetta deliziosa e discreta lontana dal caos ...   poi la vicinanza dell'hotel al centro città ci ha permesso di fare delle piacevolissime passeggiate.
Grazie al tutto il personale del Grand hotel Punta Molino e grazie Ischia !!!! 
Ci rivedemo presto!!!!!",5,2014,07,15
05,"Le 5* dell hotel sono: la struttura, i servizi, l accoglienza, il cibo e la clientela.","Peccato rientrare dopo aver trascorso quattro giorni al Grand Hotel Punta Molino....amiamo spostarci tanto ma il Punta Molino e' un posto dove torneremo molto presto....l ingresso situato dopo tanta pineta lascia fuori un mondo caotico, l ambiente e' quello di altri tempi, elegante romantico, raffinato....abbiamo pernottato in villa, posto molto silenzioso (in terrazza parlavamo sotto voce pur di non far rumore), l arredo in linea con l'eleganza dell Hotel, spazi sufficienti, servizio eccellente ( cambio biancheria tutti i giorni). In piscina come in spiaggia lettini comodi per tutti e sempre preparati con doppi teli. Ben due le piscine termali, una per goderti il sole e l altra coperta per quando piove. Palestra ben attrezzata e sempre pulita. Il cibo abbondante e di eccellente qualità.... Al Punta Molino Hotel nostro figlio ha finalmente deciso di mangiare pesce in quantità... La vera sorpresa e' aver notato i proprietari ovunque sempre pronti a cogliere ogni richiesta e ad esaudire ogni desiderio dei clienti. Grazie per il fantastico soggiorno, grazie perché ad Ischia sappiamo dove esaudire i nostri sogni.",5,2014,07,13
05,Week end relax,Sicuramente l hotel più bello e confortevole dell isola ischitana camere pulitissime ed efficienti servizio in camera velocissimo come ristorazione anke al top come posizione e centralissimo a due passi dalla strada principale dell isola la quasi assenza di bambini permette di riposarsi alla grande sia in riva al mare che in piscina inoltre c'è anche un centro SPA stupendo con personale preparatissimo insomma che dire andate al punta molino e sarete soddisfatti al 100%,5,2014,07,11
05,Che luogo incantevole!,"E' veramente una splendida struttura, con la spiaggia privata e le piscine si respira un'atmosfera unica!! Ho trascorso un weekend molto rilassante,tutto dedicato al mio benessere senza mai uscire dall'albergo!Non vedo l'ora di tornare!",5,2014,07,09
05,Tante pretese solo perchè davanti al Castello Aragonese.,"Hotel (il Grand è superfluo) d'antan, poco aggiornato su tutti i servizi. Camere (avevo una superior) con arredamento vecchio e comunque con spazi limitati. Saloni e sala da pranzo appena sopra la media. Il ristorante a bordo piscina un po' improvvisato. Il servizio mediocre.
Piscina esterna quasi inutilizzabile, piccola e sempre in ombra. Posti prendisole quasi nulli sia a bordo piscina che sulla spiaggia di palafitte (poco sicura) sul mare di fronte all'Hotel.
La SPA (forse intendevano società per azioni), perchè di centro benessere poco o nulla: due/tre stanzine oltretutto in parte comunicanti quindi prive di riservatezza.
Boh ?! Le stelle della categoria le hanno rapite allo splendido cielo che costantemente  sovrasta l'incantevole ubicazione di questo Hotel depassé. Mi aspettavo molto di più !
Per fortuna l'isola d'Ischia ripara alle mancanze sopra descritte e questo spiega perchè questo hotel continui a lavorare.",2,2014,07,05
05,5* spente!,"Situato ad Ischia porto nel verde e sul lungomare, nell'isola pedonale, possiede una spiaggetta, una piscina di acqua dolce ( poco godibile perché gran parte del giorno all'ombra e con poco spazio intorno per stendersi al sole, si sente la mancanza di un prato)e una piccola piscina termale. E' una struttura ancora elegante anche se si percepisce deve aver vissuto tempi migliori negli anni '60, dove nell'annesso nightclub ""Rangio Fellone"" Peppino di Capri e Fred Bongusto esordivano al piano bar. Si cena in un bel salone, il personale è molto professionale, la mattina si fa colazione all'aperto in un'ambiente piacevole vicino le piscine. La mia camera era posta al pian terreno,sopra quella che credo fosse la lavanderia del' hotel,  vi si poteva accedere anche evitando l'ingresso principale, devo dire che sembrava essere stati relegati tra le stanze di servizio, le ultime 2 notti ci hanno spostato in una stanza all'ultimo piano con finestre e terrazzino che aveva una discreta vista ma puzzava tantissimo di fumo da essere impraticabile. C'è il parcheggio . Considerando che ha 5 stelle mi aspettavo di più!",3,2014,06,25
05,Situazione fantastica,"sono stato due giorni nel paradiso.
albergo centralissimo ma llo stesso tempo al riparo dei rumori del centro.

camere vista amre fantastica sia quando ti svegli che al tramonto ti fa sentire veramente in vacanza.

situazione TOP.",5,2014,06,24
05,Camere fatiscenti,"L'hotel non corrisponde alla categoria che vanta, soprattutto per quanto riguarda le stanze, vecchie, con letti vergognosi, copriletti da pensione a 3 stelle. Armadi vecchi e puzzolenti. Molto rumoroso, si sente anche il respiro dei vicini.  Non torneremo",1,2014,06,22
05,Hotel a 5* dove sono i sapori e gli odori della cucina napoletana non esistono,"Ottima posizione, così pure la pulizia, il comfort della camera ed i servizi offerti. Unica pecca la cucina: nulla da eccepire sulla quantità (colazione e antipasti e dolci a cena a buffet ed a volontà), ma i sapori dei pasti tutti uguali. I sapori e gli odori della cucina napoletana in questo albergo non esistono, grazie al rifornimento delle materie prime dalla grande distribuzione foodservice. E poi i costi delle bevande ci sono sembrati un pochino esagerati.",3,2014,06,10
05,MAX - RELAX...CON STYLE E PROFESSIONALITA',"Prenotazione effettuata con un po' di perplessità...ma alla fine rivelatasi un gran successo.
Dall'accoglienza del check-in all'accompagnamento dei propri bagagli in auto parcheggiata internamente alla struttura....servizio veramente OTTIMO ed ECCELLENTE...svolto dall'intero personale dell'hotel con molta professionalità e cortesia....d'altronde è cio' che un cliente si aspetta quando sceglie una struttura a 5 stelle...anche se a volte non è così e la nostra esperienza lo può ben dire.
Camera 206 bella confortevole, pulita con affaccio sull'ingresso della hall con terrazzino , tavolino e due comode sedie in legno reclinabili, con scorcio sul mare. Servizio rifacimento della camera, cambio asciugamani e biancheria letto due volte al giorno...ottimo...colazione abbondantissima e completa in tutto. Inoltre noi abbiamo scleto la soluzione mezza pensione che si è rivelata praticamente ECCELLENTE, in quanto non solo si mangia divinamente ma è servita con uno staff d'equipe praticamente al TOP (mètre, somelier, camerieri tutti bravissimi) .
Struttura Consigliatissima per chi vuole trascorrere alcuni giorni di max relax e lasciarsi coccolare da tutto cio' che offre l'intera struttura. Complimenti continuate sempre così....ci ritorneremo sicuramente.",5,2014,06,03
05,Strepitoso,"Premesso che non gli do' 5 stelle solo per la mia filosofia di non dare mai 5 stelle e non certo per demeriti dell'hotel, e' stato un soggiorno ancora migliore di quanto immaginassi. Va detto che ho sfruttato un'offerta presente sul sito.
La struttura e' nella parte più bella del tratto ischia porto - carta romana ed è all'interno di un parco; l'hotel e' antico ed elegante, a pochi metri dal mare. Le stanze sono belle e confortevoli (la nostra era vista metà parco e metà mare), forse l'unica pecca delle stesse e' che la mattina entrava un po' troppo luce perché le tende non erano troppo scure e perché' le stesse non arrivavano a terra. 
Ha 3 piscine, una di acqua calda termale (34-35 gradi), un'altra di acqua fredda e la terza coperta, vicino la palestra e la sauna.
La colazione (una delle migliori mai fatte in vita mia, c'erano, per esempio, almeno 10 tipi di ricotta e cosa mai vista, le uova cucinate con 3 cotture diverse, 3, 5 o 6 minuti).
Inoltre, come detto, e' a pochi metri dal mare, e gli ospiti dell'hotel hanno accesso ad una spiaggia privata molto bella e con bellissima vista su Procida e sul Castello Aragonese.
Infine, un plauso sia alla proprietà (dei veri signori) sia allo staff, competente, gentile e disponibile,
Sicuramente da tornarci.",4,2014,06,01
05,Hotel 5 stelle con alcune pecche,"Ho soggiornato x una settimana in questo hotel 5 stelle ad Ischia e devo dire che la posizione è fantastica il personale cordiale e pronto a soddisfare ogni tua richiesta ma devo sottolineare che un 5 stelle non può avere camere superior con la doccia dentro la vasca da bagno ( infatti dopo mi hanno dato una camera appena ristrutturata con vasca idromassaggio e  boxdoccia ).Colazione ben fornita con formaggi freschi stupendi ma non mi devi mettere gli yogurt nei vasetti del supermercato ma nelle ciotole .
Molto gradite le previsioni del giorno dopo con cioccolatini buona notte .Giulia",4,2014,05,25
05,traumhaft schöner Urlaub,"Ich verbrachte meinen 75. Geburtstag im Hotel. Wie in den Vorjahren war alles perfekt. Der Service wird von Jahr zu Jahr besser. Zimmer und Speisen erfüllen meine Vorstellungen von einem 5***** Hotel. Auch bei der Auswahl der Gäste war man ""gefühlt"" vorsichtiger, was reiche Russen betrifft. Leider musste ich wegen eines Todesfalles in der Familie vorzeitig abreisen. Auch dies wurde vom sehr freundlichen Personal perfekt organisiert, speziellen Dank an Frau Daniela de Vanna. Solange es meine Gesundheit zulässt, werde ich wieder das Punta Molina buchen.",5,2014,05,14
05,Relax e mare in pieno centro ischitano,"Siamo stati per il ponte del 1 maggio in compagnia di un'altra coppia di amici in questo bell'albergo, situato in pieno centro di Ischia porto(vicino anche ad Ischia ponte con una piacevole e breve passeggiata), ma praticamente sulla spiaggia ed immerso in un bellissimo e curato parco. Abbiamo scelto questa struttura dopo un'attenta ricerca effettuata su TA, il giudizio e' decisamente positivo, anche se la struttura non è proprio un 5 stelle. Indubbiamente per il servizio le stelle le merita tutte, ottima le cene ed eccezionale il servizio, il cibo era tutto di primissima qualità, vario, abbondante e cucinato a dovere. I buffet, sia quello dell'antipasto che quello dei dolci, sono veramente da sogno. Unico appunto da fare al ristorante è l'eccessivo ricarico delle bevande, per il resto tutto veramente eccellente. Le colazioni vengono servite sulla bella veranda e sono varie ed abbastanza buone, anche se un po' carenti nella parte degli affettati.
Per ciò che concerne le camere posso dire che anche qui il servizio e' da 5 stelle, pulizia eccellente, cambio biancheria da bagno anche serale e gradito e' il Bacio Perugina della sera, set di cortesia discreto e sufficiente. La nostra camera era una confort vista parco (abbiamo usufruito di un up grade gratuito), luminosa, arredata con gusto e molto silenziosa anche se con una TV di piccolo schermo e con canali mal sintonizzati e comunque nell'insieme carina e dignitosa ma senza optional da 5 stelle (tipo bollitori, macchinette caffè, acqua minerale ecc..).
Gli ambienti interni sono in stile classico, ma molto comodi, purtroppo noi siamo capitati con delle serate fredde e piovose ed abbiamo usufruito dei salotti e dei tavolini da gioco che sono risultati utili per farci trascorrere delle ore in tranquillità.
Gli ambienti esterni forse sono risultati un po' sacrificati, infatti se si arriva tardi è difficile trovare dei lettini a bordo piscina; tuttavia è molto carina la piscina con l'acqua termale esterna con un incantevole panorama sul castello Aragonese e Capri,  mentre quella fredda non è stato possibile provarla considerata la temperatura polare esterna. Altro discorso invece è per la piscina interna, che risulta essere piccola, buia, priva di zona relax adeguata e tenuta male in quanto la maggior parte degli idromassaggi non funzionano. Inoltre vi sono delle orribili addobbi floreali di plastica a ridosso di una parete di roccia che appaiono del tutto stonati in un hotel a 5 stelle!!!!
La spiaggia e' molto carina anche se non posso dire se è funzionale o meno in quanto il tempo non ci ha concesso di frequentarla. 
Carina e pulita e' la piccola SPA che ho utilizzato per fare un massaggio con la brave e simpatica Emanuela.
Altra nota positiva e' la gentilezza del personale, da quello della reception a quello del ristorante a quello del servizio ai piani, tutti, ma proprio tutti sono sempre pronti a soddisfare ogni piu' piccola esigenza. Ultima nota positiva e' il rapporto qualità/prezzo che è risultato eccellente in quanto abbiamo prenotato sul sito dell'hotel usufruendo della tariffa Super saver.
Comunque se torneremo  ad Ischia penso che sceglierò questo rilassante luogo.",4,2014,05,12
05,fantastico,"hotel in splendida posizione, ottimo nei servizi, nella pulizia e cortesia di tutto il personale. Un particolare apprezzamento per la professionalità ed estrema gentilezza del sig.

05,Tutto stupendamente meraviglioso.,"Siamo stati in questo Hotel per il ponte di Pasqua e le nostre impressioni sono state ""quasi tutte"" ottime.
La struttura: Davvero molto bella con affaccio sul mare e vista delle isole di Procida e la selvaggia Vivara, piccola spiaggia privata ed attrezzata con accesso diretto dall'hotel, parco molto ampio e curato, siamo arrivati dopo solo 3 giorni dalla riapertura ed ancora non era tutto al top ma si vedeva l'impegno profuso nei preparativi per la stagione estiva.
Il personale: Tutti, indistintamente, molto professionali, attenti e propensi ad esaudire ogni esigenza del cliente. L'upgrade con una camera con balcone messaci a disposizione dalla gentilezza e disponibilità del Sig. Gianpiero ha fatto la felicità del nostro cagnolino Chicco.
Il trattamento: Abbiamo scelto un soggiorno con mezza pensione e nei 6 giorni che ci hanno visto ospiti in questa struttura siamo stati davvero coccolati, ad esempio la vigilia di Pasqua al nostro ritorno in camera, dopo cena, abbiamo trovato una splendida scatola di cioccolatini ed un biglietto di Auguri da parte della Direzione e del personale del Grand Hotel Punta Molino, inoltre ogni sera trovavamo sempre due baci perugina ed un biglietto con la buona notte e le previsioni del tempo per il giorno dopo. La pulizia e le attenzioni del personale sono state massime.
Il Ristorante: A parte l'educazione, la professionalità e la discrezione messa nel dialogo e nella proposizione dei menù, abbiamo gustato pasti di una bontà che definire unica e forse anche riduttiva.... complimenti a tutto lo staff di cucina e di sala.
Sala Colazioni: Menzione a parte per questo angolo di Paradiso che posizionato, tempo permettendo, su di un terrazzo con vista mare, rende stupenda la giornata già dai primi momenti dopo il risveglio. Buffet colazioni davvero eccellente e adeguato ad un 5 stelle, le particolarità delle proposte sono davvero uniche.... credo che siano pochi gli hotel che propongono una ricotta di bufala che ha del fantastico.
Dopo tante sperticate lodi, tutte meritate, devo comunque parlare anche di alcune pecche che dovrebbero essere migliorate:
1) La piscina termale coperta è poco accogliente, fredda, non adeguata alla ricezione della clientela che, dopo aver usufruito della piscina, non ha la possibilità di rilassarsi con le chasslonge, come si dovrebbe; Le bocchette degli idromassaggi non erano funzionanti per cui si perdeva quel particolare trattamento. Adiacente, nello stesso locale, c'è la sala fitness, ben attrezzata e curata.
2) La connessione Wifi dell'hotel nelle camere e nella Hall non era stabile e di intensità scarsa.
3) La sintonizzazione dei canali tv era davvero limitata e sicuramente da risintonizzare con l'immissioni di canali digitali o di una piattaforma Sky o Mediaset.
Desidero pensare che, tranne la piscina coperta che non si può, credo, migliorare al momento.... le altre due piccole note negative saranno sicuramente sistemate al meglio, desidero ricordare che l'hotel aveva riaperto da soli 3 giorni ed i lavori erano frenetici per avere tutto al top.
Concludo dicendo che abbiamo riscoperto, grazie al Grand Hotel Punta Molino, l'Isola di Ischia e che, sicuramente, nelle prossime visite qui sarà nostra prima scelta questo stupendo Hotel.
Grazie a tutto lo staff della reception, a tutte le persone dei piani e tutto il personale del bar e di sala per averci coccolati e fatti sentire a casa. 
Alla prossima,,,, un saluto da Marisa, Antonio ed il nostro piccolo cagnolino Chicco.",5,2014,05,01

Si fanno in 4 per soddisfare ogni tua esigenza. L hotel è un po' vecchio stile, noi abbiamo scelto una camera piccola  (offerta super Saver)  magari non da 5 stelle ma ci sono anche camere molto belle. Letto comodissimo e camera lato giardino silenziosa. Abbiamo preferito risparmiare sulla stanza per poterci concedere trattamenti SPA e massaggi . Inoltre consiglio vivamente di optare per la mezza pensione. Le cene sono deliziose, il clue della vacanza. Antipasti a buffet con ricchissima scelta, molto pesce affumicato e formaggi tipici campani, tutto davvero buonissimo. Ci siamo riposati e rilassati nelle due piscine calde.",5,2014,04,27
05,ritorno ogni anno,"ottima ospitalità e servizio eccellente con grande  cortesia.Il personale del centro benessere è abbastanza preparato ed il centro stesso è assai equipaggiato.Posizione eccellente e assai romantica per giornate e notti indimenticabili.Peccato che la spiaggia privata ,a volte, era frequentata da persone e ragazzi non ospitati dalla struttura.
la posizione centrale a due passi dalla elegantissima  via Vittorio Colonna,ne fa un punto strategico per arrivare in taxi o a piedi in qualsiasi punto dell'isola.Per quanto mi riguarda,ottimo il rapporto prezzo qualità.",4,2014,01,29
05,Oasi di pace nella bella Ischia,"In vacanza ad Ischia, io e la mia compagna, abbiamo soggiornato in questo bellissimo hotel suggeritoci da una vera esperta del settore. Strategica la posizione: direttamente sul mare e vicinissimo al Corso Vittoria Colonna a due passi dal centro e dal castello Aragonese. Che dire? Già entrando nella hall si respira il profumo del lusso di altri tempi e della magnificenza. Impeccabile. Personale qualificato e gentilissimo e, al ricevimento, sempre pronto a proporci pazientemente itinerari per le nostre passeggiate e a darci tutte le ""dritte"" del caso. La nostra stanza era arredata in stile classico napoletano, molto ""folkloristica"". Ma c'è anche un'ala nuova con arredamento moderno ed essenziale. Fantastiche le piscine, sia interna che esterne, una classica e molto grande e l'altra con acqua termale a circa 37 gradi e idromassaggio. Fornito anche di sauna e di spiaggia attrezzata. Colazione ottima e varia. Abbiamo passato tre giorni assolutamente rilassanti e rigeneranti.",5,2013,10,10
05,Buono ma da ristrutturare,"Hotel in posizione eccellente vista magnifica ci siamo trovati molto bene, solo che credo che sia piu' un buono tre stelle che un cinque stelle. Le piscine termali erano carine ma la colazione era pessima tutti i dolci erano qulli congelati e riscaldati al microonde.. peccato",3,2013,10,09

05,TUTTO PERFETTO,"l'HOTEL ha una posizione perfetta, perchè è sul mare ma a piedi in pochi minuti si raggiunge il centro. La piscina termale all'aperto, quella interna il mare, la spa è tutto bellissimo (un cordiale saluto ai bagnini simpaticissimi) Il venerdì c'è stata un cena di gala favolosa tutto era buonissimo ,la sera c'è piano bar .Il personale è gentile e sempre a disposizione ,tutto è curato nei dettagli. Il prezzo del caffè e dell'acqua sono un po'  esagerati del resto è un 5 stelle.",5,2013,09,03
05,great location for a fabulous holiday,"SIamo capitati al Punta Molino per caso per assenza di disponibilità nella struttura dove eravamo stati l'anno precedente ed  è stata la scelta più azzeccata per le nostre vacanze. La struttura è  molto confortevole con una ampia terrazza sulla piscina. Il mare veramente a due passi con un servizio spiaggia di tutto rispetto. Il personale attento,  servizievole, sorridente. Una ospitalità alberghiera d'altri tempi. Un ristorante di ottimo livello (soprattutto per quanto riguarda il buffet antipasti e desserts) Diverse zone living molto accoglienti. Una piscina termale all'interno e una deliziosa all'esterno. Una musica soft per accompagnare aperitivi e dopo cena. Ci torneremo",5,2013,09,02
05,Che pace,"Cercavamo un posto per ritrovare pace e serenità, lo abbiamo trovato la scorsa settimana in questa struttura. Un pontile sul mare perfetto ambiente e personale cordialissimi, (ci hanno fatto trovare babà e sfogliatelle a colazione appena le abbiamo richieste. Grazie) 
Ci torneremo sicuramente .",5,2013,08,31

ci tornerò, spero, presto.",4,2013,08,30
05,Come a casa,"Personale gentilissimo e molto simpatico  che ti fa sentire proprio come a casa! Albergo ineccepibile, con tutti i confort possibili. Il primo giorno la stanza, non essendo molto grande non mi ha entusiasmato ma se ci si sofferma a guardare i dettagli si può notare che le lenzuola sono di ottima qualità, il letto è comodissimo e la pulizia ineccepibile! Lo consiglio per posizione, ospitalità e servizi. Sicuramente torneremo!",5,2013,08,21
05,Ottimo,"Sono stata una settimana in questo hotel ed è stato senz'altro un ottimo soggiorno. Il punto fortissimo è un servizio ottimo lo staff MOLTO cordiale, gentile e disponibile!

05,"Ottimo cibo, mare cristallino e massima dispobilitità e cordialità, cosa si può chiedere di più?","Sono appena rientrata da una settimana trascorsa con il mio ragazzo ed un'altra coppia di nostri amici in questo meraviglioso hotel e già non vediamo l'ora di poter vivere nuovamente quest'eperienza ischitana. In primis vorrei eprimere il mio elogio allo staff del Punta Molino che, sin dalla discesa dall'aliscafo (abbiamo viaggiato in aereo sfruttando il servizio navetta offerto dall'hotel), è stato a nostra disposizione cercando di soddisfare al meglio ogni nostra richiesta con cortesia e gentilezza. Sono stati tutti impeccabili e disponibili. In particolare vorrei ringraziare i bagnini Franco, Raffaele ed Umberto che hanno reso indimenticabili le mostre giornate in spiaggia grazie alla loro assistenza ed ai loro consigli. Inoltre vorrei congratularmi con la cucina per la varietà di piatti offertaci ogni sera e per la bontà e la preparazione di ogni portata. 
Leggendo recensioni precedenti, ho notato che molti si lamentavano delle camere secondo loro troppo antiquate. Io ritengo che l'arredo delle camere sia invece uno dei punti di forza di questa struttura perchè rispecchia l'essenza partenopea dell'isola, dando così la possibilità ai suoi ospiti di vivere appieno lo spirito del'isola.
Diversi, inoltre, si sono lamentati della spiaggia e della posizione dell'hotel. Sinceramente non ho notato le pecche indicate, ma al contrario ho apprezzato la spiaggia che risolta più accogliente e meno caotica delle immense distese di sabbia che si possono trovare sui litorali della penisola dove le persone per poter raggiungere il mare devono fare i chilometri. Ed ho anche apprezzato la posizione dell'hotel che offre la possibilità di raggiungere facilmente la zona della movida ischitana senza però essere sottoposti all'inquinamento acustico causato dalla vita notturna di Ischia Porto.
Secondo me, il Grand Hotel Punta Molino merita tutte le stelle che gli hanno attribuito e lo consiglierei a tutti coloro amanti del mare cristallino e della buona, anzi ottima, tavola!",5,2013,08,04
05,Il paradiso in Italia esiste davvero!!!,"Proprio un paio di ore fa sono atterrato a Linate e già sento un profondo vuoto. Solo al pensiero dei giorni trascorsi presso di Voi mi viene una nostalgia incredibile e, se potessi, tornerei al volo e senza aspettare un secondo! Come al solito servizio eccellente ed impeccabile, cortesia gentilezza e disponibilità sono da sempre, a mio parere, tre qualità che rendono magico il soggiorno all'interno dell'hotel. Un pensiero particolare va ai mitici Raffaele, Umberto e Franco che mi hanno visto crescere e hanno, da quando avevo 8 anni, allietato e reso memorabile ogni minuto passato in spiaggia. Non vedo già l'ora di vedervi l'anno prossimo e, perché no, potervi affidare un giorno mio figlio, come mio papà ha fatto con me!",5,2013,08,02
05,Davvero spettacolare,"Non avevo alcun dubbio, leggendo le lusinghiere recensioni di molti altri ospiti del Grand Hotel Punta Molino e pur tenendo in debito conto qualcuna di quelle meno esaltanti, che il mio (ahimè) breve soggiorno sarebbe stato di tutto relax, conforto e soprattutto di grande soddisfazione.
E così è stato. Il Grand Hotel è costituito da una struttura assai gradevole e confortevole, proprio a due passi dal mare, immersa nel rilassante verde di in un bel e ben tenuto parco, con una vista incantevole lungo tutta la linea dell'orizzonte.
Il personale tutto - dall'efficentissimo Direttore ed a quello della reception, che ti danno un cortese e ben augurante benvenuto,  a quello del servizio in sala, del servizio spiaggia, del servzio in camera - è davvero assai professionale e qualificato.
E che dire della bravura del personale addetto al centro benessere? Per loro, una nota particolare di merito, senza nulla togliere agli altri!
Per quanto mi riguarda (e dello stesso avviso sono stati tutti i miei familiari) non c'è possibilità di muovere alcun rilievo a chicchesia. Anzi!
Le stanze che ci sono state riservate sono risultate ben curate, spaziose, dotate di tutto quello che occorre per rendere gradevole il tuo soggiorno.
La colazione, che viene servita a mezzo buffet particolarmente assortito e di altissima qualità, sia che si parli di dolce che di salato o della freschissima frutta di stagione, acquista un certo valore aggiunto con la straordinaria bellezza e spaziosità della terazza. Una vista davvero mozzafiato.
Quando, con rammarico, stai lasciando l'hotel e l'Isola, viene spontaneo domandarsi, come in un noto spot pubblicitario, ... cosa vuoi di più dalla vita...
Per me, promosso a pieni voti e con lode piena. Bravi tutti.",5,2013,07,30
05,C'era una volta...,"E' abbastanza imperdonabile che una struttura del genere che già mostra abbondantemente i segni del tempo passato, anche per ciò che riguarda la natura su cui poggia (""la spiaggia"" pochi metri quadrati ha subìto una erosione spaventosa come tutta la zona di Porto...)sia condotta in modo a dir poco sciatto e svogliato. Ma partiamo da ""fatti"" che si commentano da soli e per i quali destano non poco perplessità pareri entusiasti di altri recensori (?)...
Camere: se per avere la sensazione del cinque stelle, bisogna rivolgersi ad una Junior Suite, (qualche camera rimodernata da poco a prezzi esagerati sostenuti da un tipo di clientela in grande maggioranza battente bandiera russa ), dato il ""gap"" incolmabile con il resto delle altre camere davvero modeste, o per arredi vetusti o, addirittura, per grandezza, allora non ci siamo! Se poi si confrontano con quelle di altre strutture che distano a poca distanza di pari... stelle, la differenza è abissale! Servizi. Assenza di Wifi nelle camere, impensabile nel 2013 quando anche tre o due stelle lo offrano, assenza di quotidiani offerti alla lettura dei clienti alloggiati (anche questo si riscontra ormai in ogni hotel, indipendentemente dalle stelle...); alta permeabilità da parte degli esterni dello spazio ""esclusivo"" sul mare dell'hotel e, talvolta, anche delle piscine che lascia molto perplessi ed indispettiti; Ristorante: sala sottotono, al contrario dello spazio all'aperto di cui, chissà per quale arcano motivo,si può usufruire solo a fine settimana, con evidente disappunto e delusione dei clienti che sopportano al chiuso anche assenza di aria condizionata (almeno a luglio..); carta dei vini che sfiora il ridicolo, con presenze solo di vini locali e campani... forse sei o sette di altre regioni; cibo nella norma, elaborato discretamente.. a parte qualche svista tra gli antipasti tipo gamberi dall'esclusivo sapore di acido fenico (potente conservante, per carità, ma odioso al gusto...), anche se di cinque piatti a scelta, uno solo di pesce proposto appare un po' misero... Sinceramente, c'è molto da lavorare se si vuole rilanciare e collegare quest'hotel a ciò che è stato nei decenni passati... Certo la crisi avrà infierito non poco, ma allora si studi un'altra formula o struttura più consona ad una nuova categoria, magari con una stella in meno: visto che è anche dalla modestia ed umiltà che certe aziende possono recuperare...",2,2013,07,23
05,Tutto come annunciato,"Abbiamo prenotato una camera ""Classic"" direttamente dal sito scegliendo la formula super saver (molto semplice prenotare). All'arrivo ci hanno accolto in modo impeccabile e ci è stata offerta, senza supplemento, la sistemazione in camera superior (decisamente una bella sorpresa). Per quanto breve il nostro soggiorno (3 notti in camera e colazione) abbiamo provato ad usufruire di quasi tutti i servizi che l'albergo offre. Ottima la colazione; ottimo lo snack al bar; ottima cucina e ristorante. Spiaggia e Spa decisamente rispondenti alle attese. Grande pulizia nelle camere e grande professionalità, gentilezza del personale. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Bellissima, anche se breve, vacanza. Grazie a tutti!! Martina",5,2013,07,20
05,Non lo consiglierei a nessuno,"Avevamo prenotato in questo albergo per tre notti di un fine settimana.
Ci avevano dato una camera al quarto piano che a dir loro la migliore ma vecchia e mai rinnovata dagli anni 80, abbiamo chiesto  e avuto una camera nuova ma con una visuale non del mare ma una maltenuta tettoia di legno.
La piscina interna priva di asciugami  e vecchi neon ingialliti e rumori di vecchi motori che venivano dal tetto.
La sera al ristorante con un personale poco preparato   ho avuto anche la sorpresa di un trovare un capello nella mia carne.
La colazione era orribile, brioches  neanche nelle peggiori linee aeree.
In tanti anni che viaggiamo non ho mai trovato un albergo di 5 stelle così fatiscente e disorganizzato.",1,2013,07,17
05,Molto buono,"Tutto bene,ottimo il soggiorno.Albergo situato a pochi metri dal mare in pieno centro in bella vista del Castello Aragonese.Camere pulite,personale preparato e cortese.Unici nei sono il cattivo funzionamento del wi fi ed i prezzi alti",4,2013,07,04
05,Charming,"Un hotel sin falsos lujos pero con un servicio excelente acorde con la calidad hotelera de Italia en los ""Grandes Albergos"" La isla de Ischia una maravilla sin las multitudes de su vecina Capri. La oferta gastronomica excelente. Muy recomendable la media pension.",4,2013,07,01
05,Lieta conferma se possibile ancora migliorato,"Siamo tornati al punta molino di Ischia porto. La collocazione in riva al mare all'interno di un immenso parco e l'architettura ancora attuale pur se datata ti dispongono al meglio appena arrivi. Il ristorante e' ancora migliorato mettendo in prima linea un giovane cresciuto nelle cucine dell'albergo ma che dimostra già chiarezza di idee nello sfruttamento delle meravigliose risorse della terra ischitana. La sala e' sempre gestita con polso fermo e abilità' da franco mentre lo staff del bar (sarà, Giorgio, Luigi) guidati da Ciro dimostrano che si può coniugare perfettamente alta professionalità e simpatia. Fino a quando ci saranno loro noi ci saremo. Unico neo il cattivo funzionamento del wi fi",5,2013,06,24
05,SEMPLICEMENTE FANTASTICO,E' stata la vacanza piu bella di tutta la mia vita. L'hotel è spettacolare e le piscine e il mare semplicemente fantastiche. Personale cordialissimo e la cena da non farne a meno. Sicuramente ci tornerò,5,2013,06,10
05,Esperienza da sogno con sgambetto iniziale.,"Per il nostro viaggio di nozze abbiamo deciso di rimanere in Italia,non per nulla chiamato il Bel Paese,e più precisamente ad Ischia,dove la mia Signora era già stata tempo addietro.L'ubicazione dell'hotel è a dir poco favolosa,splendida vista sul Castello Aragonese e sulla spiaggia dinnanzi alla nostra camera;ma,come in tutte le cose belle,c'è sempre qualcosa che non và.Al nostro arrivo,siamo ricevuti alla hall e,dopo la solita routine di domande,veniamo accompagnati,all'interno dell'hotel ad una stanza con vista diretta sul Castello:peccato che la nostra prenotazione fosse per una camera con balconcino privato nella Villa all'interno del giardino del Punta Molino.Non nego un forte disagio per questa situazione(conclusasi il giorno seguente)ma grazie all'intervento del tour operator in persona e del Sig.Luigi (persona di una classe innata )siamo riusciti ad avere una stanza da 1000 e 1 notte......comunque Ischia (isola dal fascino assoluto ) ci rivedrà sicuramente per il 2014,speriamo col nostro pargolo.....",5,2013,06,03
05,Se fossi un libro....,"Se fossi un libro profumerei di mare, di calore, di sapore e di silenzi perfetti, di contemplazione e di pace.
Una penna con inchiostro indelebile mi intitolerebbe 'Punta Molino', ma sono solo la scrittrice e non trovo le parole adatte per poter scegliere ciò con cui il mio libro desidererebbe essere vestito, mi limiterò, pertanto, a dirvi che, poche volte nei miei frequenti viaggi ho goduto di così tante piccole cose che hanno reso la mia vacanza indimenticabile!
Il risveglio ovattato in un candido letto, vezzeggiata dalle cure amorevoli e sincere di attente signore addette alle camere, cui nulla sfugge.
L'abbondante colazione servita su una splendida terrazza immersa nel tiepido sole del mattino, da cui ammirare il Golfo di Napoli, accarezzare con lo sguardo i contorni di Procida e poco più in la, allungare un braccio verso Capri, quasi a sfiorarla!
La carezza delle calde acque termali, cui abbandonarsi per dimenticare i ritmi stressanti di luoghi, ora, lontani!
Che fatica descrivere con onesta mano tutto ciò di cui si può godere in questo strategico e tranquillo angolo d'Ischia!
Basterebbe poter descrivere la complicità, il calore umano, i sorrisi naturali e cortesi, la cura e le attenzioni riservate al cliente, il gusto e la bontà del cibo, i profumi del vino, il sapore del caffè, quello vero e l'eleganza diffusa in tutta l'isola a rendere indimenticabile il soggiorno.
Ma ..., ma voglio aggiungere che varcare la soglia del Punta Molino non è che l'inizio di quel cambiamento interiore che solo ad un occhio poco attento e distante, sfugge.
Ciò che la mia penna non riesce a incidere sul libro, Punta Molino lo ha inciso indelebilmente nel mio cuore!",5,2013,05,08
05,Tutto sommato una bella esperienza...,"abbiamo deciso di trascorrere tre notti in questa struttura che ci ha attratti per il prezzo convincente e l'offerta abbastanza ampia, includente anche la spiaggia e tre piscine. Vi é molta calma nella struttura, e l'ambiente appare curato e tranquillo. La colazione con qualche piccola mancanza risulta tutto sommato completa, anche se non si può tostare il pane!!!
l'offerta del bar funziona , per quanto riguarda invece il ristorante non posso esprimermi dato che non abbiamo mai cenato in albergo.
pecca madornale sono le STANZE piccole e male organizzate. Noi abbiamo preso una stanza per tre ospiti , e ci hanno inseriti in una stanza regolare in cui hanno aggiunto un letto ed in cui muoversi risultava ostico. La pulizia era molto buona e meritevoli di encomio sono tutti i membri dello staff della struttura, sempre cortesi e disponibili, come d'altronde si addice ad una struttura a 5 stelle. Belle la palestra e la piscina coperta. Anche la organizzazione della partenza ci ha favorevolmente impressionati",4,2013,05,06
05,Nel complesso vacanza discreta,"Sarà stato per il brutto tempo che c'è stato, ma non ripenserò a questa vacanza come a qualcosa da voler ripetere. La struttura è bella ed è bella la posizione sul mare, con vista meravigliosa. La camera assegnataci, una comfort al 3° piano con parziale vista mare, ampia e comoda. Il personale tutto è stato ineccepibile, disponiile, professionale e soprattutto solare. Ciò che non mi ha entusiasmato, e che non mi stimolerebbe a trascorrerci un periodo più lungo (noi siamo stati 3 notti), è la gestione dei lettini nei limitati spazi solarium bordo piscina. Non mi ha dato fastidio lo spazio ristretto che era comprensibilissimo, ma mi ha innervosito molto il principio che chi per primo poggia il suo libro o altro effetto personale su un dato lettino se lo riserva per tutto il giorno, anche se poi di fatto sta da tutt'altra parte. Dover pensare ogni mattina a dover correre prima degli altri furbi per andare a guadagnarmi il posto francamente è qualcosa che rifiuto totalmente, soprattutto in un 5 stelle. Per quello che riguarda la cena è stata soddisfacente, ottima la qualità del cibo e la presentazione, ma poco carattere nei sapori e buffet un pò ripetitivo. La colazione assolutamente abbondante, varia per quello che riguarda il salato ma non altrettanto per il dolce. Mi sarei aspettata anche qualche torta tipica, ogni giorno diversa, oltre ai soliti cornetti, brioches, muffins e tartellette; mi sarei aspettata della spremuta di arancia fresca al posto dei succhi pronti; mi sarei senz'altro aspettato di poter tostare il pane.....
L'ultima cosa che mi ha un pò storta è stata la piscina termale coperta, dove l'idromassaggio non funzionava, con alcune parti arrugginite e con dei tristi fiori finti ai bordi....
Queste che ho espresso sono alcune delle attenzioni fondamentali che mi rendono piacevole e veramente rilassante un soggiorno, più del cioccolatino in camera o del cameriere di sala subito pronto a rimboccarti il bicchiere ogniqualvolta bevi...",3,2013,04,30
05,4 giorni da sogno che rimarranno nel cuore per sempre,"Cercavo un albergo con spiaggia privata ed il Grand Hotel Punta Molino è l'unico albergo che sia direttamente sul mare . Infatti uscendo dall'albergo si accede ad una spiaggetta , scendendo appena 10 scalini in pietra.
 La vista è spettacolare, difronte si vede Napoli, a sx il resto della spiaggia  ed a dx si gode la veduta dell'imponente Castello Aragonese, interessante da visitare.
Lo scenario è un dono di madre natura che  si è divertita a collocare tutt'insieme tanta bellezza.
 Fanno a gara  i colori con tutte le sfumature degli azzurri intensi, al blu cobalto, al verde smeraldo , il profumo delle alghe sugli scogli bagnati dall'acqua di mare, i gabbiani , il paesaggio.....................aggiungiamoci anche  il carattere degli isolani, spiritosi ed allegri come tutti i partenopei e la loro cucina tipica.......tutto questo fanno dell Gand Hotel Punta Molino un fiore all'occhiello dell'isola.
 Elegante, confortevole è anche un ottimo centro termale.",5,2013,04,15

Partiamo dalla camera, una sorta di mini appartamento con terrazzo a livello con lettini, ombrellone e divanetti, tutta realizzata con le classiche ceramiche azzurre che ispirano subito calma e serenità. Bella l'intera location con un ampio giardino dove ci si può tranquillamente rilassarsi seduti sui vari dondoli. Buona la colazione, e ottima la cena. Durante il mio soggiorno è stata organizzata anche una raffinata cena di gala servita all'esterno che  ha lasciato ai commensali solo commenti positivi. Unico neo la spiaggia un pò troppo piccola, ma del resto già averla ad Ischia è un lusso. Superlativo l'intero staff",4,2013,01,04

05,Magnifico!,"Abbiamo fatto il nostro ricevimento di nozze qui lo scorso giugno ma conoscevamo già questo hotel. Che dire...è un hotel bellissimo, l'atmosfera è magica, il panorama e i colori sono fantastici. L'ubicazione è perfetta perché l'hotel si trova in un posto riservato, lontano dal chiasso ma allo stesso tempo vicinissimo al centro di Ischia porto, raggiungibile in meno di cinque minuti a piedi. Il personale è estremamente professionale, cortese ed accogliente, la cucina eccezionale e basata su una scelta di prodotti di prima qualità. Le stanze arredate con gusto, sono belle e curatissime. Veramente un posto incantevole dove passare vacanze eccezionali. ",5,2012,11,10
05,l giorno più bello ben curato e ben riuscito.beautiful wedding party,"Ci siamo sposati il 4 agosto 2012 e abbiamo festeggiato le nostre nozze al Rangio Fellone e in terrazza del Hotel Punta Molino.
La location è stupenda, il tramonto con sguardo nel golfo che parte da Monte di Procida ed arriva al Castello Aragonese è emozionante.
Ottima è la qualità del cibo, impeccabile è il servizio cosi come i dettagli organizzativi.
Il ricevimento è iniziato con un ricchissimo aperitivo sulle terrazze del Rangio Fellone,famoso Night degli anni 50 e 60 dove si sono esibiti artisti come Mina, Dalla, Bongusto, ed è poi proseguito con un impeccabile cena sulla terrazza dell'hotel. Per il buffet di pasticceria, la torta e il momento dancing siamo ritornati al Rangio Fellone ripulito e organizzato per lasciarci godere le fasi finali della festa. Siamo stati coccolati dal personale dell'albergo per altri due giorni, avendo soggiornato lì prima di tornare a casa.La junior suite messa a disposizione era ampia e ben curata. Peccato che in camera abbiamo trovato dei fiori e non una bottiglia di champagne per l'ultimo festeggiamento del giorno.

I capi servizio sono giovani e bravissimi, chiedete di parlare con loro per organizzare nel dettaglio il ricevimento. Il direttore è persona colta, professionale e competente, ma nei dettagli il divario di età con gli sposi si fa sentire.",5,2012,11,09

Ambienti ampi e ben curati dove le ceramiche da sole già contribuiscono a creare un'atmosfera lussuosa ma allo stesso tempo ariosa e non soffocante. Il giardino, la piscina termale, la terrazza sul mare e la piccola spiaggia privata catturano le ore tanto da fare venire meno la voglia di uscire! Una menzione particolare merita il personale, che coccola ciascun cliente in modo assolutamente personalizzato e con discrezione.

L'acquagym è efficace. Che dire di più ? ideale per chi non cerca la mondanità di capri ma il vero e puro relax. Consiglio in coppia.

05,Stanza molto deludente.,"Il Punta Molino è un bell’Hotel. La sua posizione è perfetta. Per chi conosce molto bene l’Isola di Ischia e vi ha soggiornato molto di frequente, direi che la posizione è uno dei sui punti di forza migliori. A pochissimi minuti a piedi sia da Ischia Ponte che da Ischia Porto, vicinissimo alle strade dello shopping, di fronte al mare e allo splendido panorama del castello Aragonese,  immerso in un bellissimo giardino, silenziosissimo. Belli davvero i locali comuni, ampi eleganti, ben arredati. Gentilissimo, cortese e sorridente il personale. Buono il ristorante e il livello delle portate. Intendiamoci, non c’è da aspettarsi nulla di eccezionale o di particolarmente stuzzicante. Dal punto di vista culinario siamo lontani dalla qualità e dalla vera eccellenza di Hotel di pari categoria ad esempio sulla riviera Adriatica o in Alto Adige. Particolare la zona “mare”, ricavata tra pontili in legno, lingue di spiaggia e scogli attrezzati. E’ il genere di spiaggia  caratteristica di quella zona dell’Isola, ma è comunque molto piacevole. I bagnini sono gentilissimi, i teli mare sono addirittura due e i lettini vengono costantemente preparati ed orientati verso il sole. Il mare è sorprendentemente limpido e pulito. Veniamo invece alla nota dolente che è una sola ma molto grave. La stanza non era assolutamente all’altezza non dico di un cinque stelle ma nemmeno di un modesto Hotel di categoria inferiore. Alla prenotazione avevo richiesto una camera tripla (comfort) specificando che eravamo due adulti ed un’adolescente e avevo chiesto ragguagli sulla comodità della sistemazione e naturalmente avevo ricevuto notizie tranquillizzanti. In realtà la camera era una (piccola) doppia , con letti singoli, nella quale era stato maldestramente aggiunto un terzo letto. Dico maldestramente perché le testiere dei due letti erano state fatte scorrere lungo il muro della stanza fino a coprire le prese di corrente di uno dei comodini. Alle mie rimostranze all’arrivo (blande a causa di un viaggio lungo e della stanchezza) mi è stata proposta una stanza con vista mare, forse più gradevole (la mia più che vista parco aveva vista “retro”) ma altrettanto piccola. Poiché era da preparare ho preferito glissare. Me ne sono pentito perché il mio soggiorno non  stato per nulla confortevole. Certamente non  come ci si aspetterebbe da un cinque per il quale si paga una cifra ragguardevole. Sono un abituèè di Ischia ma difficilmente tornerò per questo al Punta Molino. Nelle sue immediate vicinanze ci sono altri due hotel altrettanto stellati e credo che nelle prossime occasioni avrò modo di provarli. Vi farò sapere….",3,2012,08,28
05,Un Ottimo ritiro per riposarsi,"Un Posto semplicemente magnifico, la location e' perfetta, isolata in mezzo al verde ma a cinque minuti dal centro della citta', grandissima professionalità sia del ricevimento che del servizio di sala, camere pulitissime e spaziose, anche quelle non vista mare, funzionante la parte termale, probabilmente da rivedere, in specie negli spazi, il centro benessere. 
Da segnalare la qualità del cibo e la simpatia degli addetti alla sala. Ottimi anche i servizi a mare tutti compresi nel prezzo dell'albergo, sicuramente proporzionato alla qualità dei servizi offerti",5,2012,08,28
05,Lusso garbato in ambiente familiare,"La tradizione del grande Albergo italiano emerge nella bellezza degli spazi comuni, nell’eccellente personale al piano, in sala ed in spiaggia, nella qualità dei differenti menu presentati ogni sera, che si sommano agli ottimi buffets degli antipasti e dei dolci. La prima colazione non delude (eccellente l’angolo dei latticini). Le piscine, una termale, sono pulite  e curate e si gode una splendida vista del Castello Aragonese. La spiaggia offre le migliori soluzioni compatibilmente con la tipologia di costa che si trova da Ischia Porto ad Ischia Ponte. Albergo isolato nel verde, in 5 minuti a piedi possiamo essere nel centralissimo Corso Vittorio Colonna. Le camere standard, migliorabili, dovrebbero essere più grandi, ma nel complesso struttura consigliata.",4,2012,08,25
05,Ricordi di infanzia,"Sono tornata in questo splendido hotel a picco sul mare dopo più di vent'anni e devo dire che i miei ricordi di bambina sono rimasti intatti!! Splendida struttura, arredata con gusto un po' vittoriano, belle piscine, ottimo staff efficiente e preparato, tutti molto cordiali e disponibili, cibo ottimo, mare pulito e ottimi trattamenti termali e beauty!!! Un oasi di pace e tranquillità , assolutamente consigliato a chi vuole trascorrere una vacanza di benessere e mare, circondato dai sorrisi e dalla gentilezza del personale!! A presto",5,2012,08,22
05,Sogno di una vacanza di mezza estate,"Un Hotel meraviglioso ! L'albergo è immerso in un vasto parco verde, direttamente sul mare ed a due passi dal centro. La struttura merita le 5 stelle. Le piscine termali (35 C° circa), posizionate sulla terrazza con vista mare, sono bellissime; la palestra è attrezzata con strumenti moderni e tecnologici; sia gli ambienti interni ed esterni sono curati in modo perfetto; la pulizia delle camere è ottima (le cameriere, gentilissime, puliscano la camera 2/3 volte al giorno). Per la spiaggia e le piscine ci sono sempre  teli da mare a disposizione. I bagnini sono particolarmente gentili e simpatici. Lo staff dell'albergo (camerieri/e,baristi,bagnini, e tutto il personale della reception) è gentilissimo e soddisfa pienamente le esigenze dei clienti. La cucina è ottima ! Si può mangiare pesce eccellente ma persino il riso è buonissimo perché lo chef Michele è un'artista! Bravi i musicisti/cantanti del piano-bar (ogni sera). Ma la cosa che ci tengo a ribadire nuovamente è la cordialità e la gentilezza di tutto lo staff (più di 70 membri di personale) nei confronti dei clienti. E' stata una bellissima vacanza rilassante.",5,2012,08,05
05,"Buono,ma non un 5 stelle..","Premetto che vengo ad Ischia gia' da 10 anni e gli ultimi 5 ho scelto questo hotel per il soggiorno.Nulla da dire per quanto riguarda il personale sia di sala che quello impegnato presso le piscine/ spiaggia sia ai vari piani ,la pulizia delle camere e' buona,le colazioni migliorabili e l'assortimento e preparazione delle cene (noi avevamo la mezza pensione) molto buone.Un particolare ringraziamento ai camerieri e al matre di sala che hanno sempre avuto un occhio di riguardo nei miei confronti......ma,e qui viene il lato negativo,non lo definirei un 5 stelle poiche' manca in alcuni punti per me essenziali: le stanze sono piccole e vecchie,il bagno (sfortuna mia?) troppo piccolo e malandato ( miscelatore d'acqua rotto,sciacquone lento...), insomma si vede che non c'e' interesse ad investire nella struttura,puntando forse al fatto che si trova in un punto bellissimo di Ischia porto con un panorama incantevole o forse si rivolge ad un altro tipo di clientela,ossia a quella straniera,in particolare russa che e' di ""bocca buona"" rispetto a quella italiana ( ho notato questo incremento negli anni..). Mi spiace dover dire queste cose perche' dopo tanti anni mi ci sono affezionata e il Manzi,seppure superiore come offerta,si trova in una posizione un po' infelice. Speriamo di trovare qualche sorpresa il prossimo anno....",4,2012,08,05
05,Un buon hotel ma non tutto è da 5 stelle,"Sono andata in questo hotel con 2 amiche per un week-end nell'isola verde, di assoluto relax, quindi abbiamo scelto la formula in mezza pensione per non avere alcun assillo
Peraltro una delle mie amiche era già stata ospite di questo hotel, di cui conservava un piacevole ricordo e ciò è stato il principale motivo della nostra scelta
Ad onor del vero, hanno anche applicato una scontistica particolare dopo aver saputo che chi prenotava era già stato ospite dell'hotel, Il che ci ha fatto molto piacere
Nel complesso un ottimo albergo e non ci sono critiche su cose importanti, ma tutto dipende dalle aspettative del cliente e in un 5 stelle le mie sono alte
I punti positivi: bella la struttura, parco ben curato, ottima la posizione (si raggiungono facilmente a piedi sia Ischia Porto, con i suoi negozi e locali, che Ischia Ponte, col suo castello), personale veramente gentile ed efficientissimo nel soddisfare qualsiasi richiesta sia alla reception che in sala, internet point disponibile gratuitamente, pulizia delle camere e degli ambienti eccellente, teli sempre disponibili sia nelle 2 piscine termali calde (una esterna ed una coperta) sia in spiaggia, SPA di buon livello, menù alla carta di pregio, vario e gradevole, ottima pasticceria a cena, abbastanza ricca e varia la colazione
Punti negativi: le bucce della frutta e le cartine dei cioccolatini con cui ci hanno accolte in camera al mattino dell'arrivo sono rimaste sul comò fino alla mattina dopo, nessuna preparazione del letto e della biancheria da notte la sera (cosa che peraltro avveniva regolarmente durante il precedente soggiorno della mia amica), antipasto al buffet a cena un pò ripetitivo e monotono e soprattutto con rapida scomparsa della parte più appetibile (le fritturine), per cui, se non si è tra i primi ad arrivare, non riesci a goderne, una certa fretta nel servizio se si arriva a cena dopo le 21.00 (è possibile cenare dalle 20.00 alle 21.30. La prima sera siamo arrivate a cena alle 21.20 e, dopo il nostro passaggio al buffet per l'antipasto, hanno iniziato a rimuovere il tutto, così da non consentirci un eventuale secondo passaggio e ci hanno servito il primo mentre ancora mangiavamo l'antipasto, il che non contribuisce a quella rilassatezza che ti fa godere di un buon pasto), pasticceria a colazione varia ma poco invitante (i soliti dolci da bar di motel, un pò ""cartonati"" e senza sapore), locali della SPA comunicanti con gli altri ambienti (cosa un pò a discapito del relax durante i trattamenti olistici), spiaggia molto piccola, ma soprattutto mi sono parecchio innervosita di dover discutere al mare con uno dei bagnini, che pretendeva di separare i componenti della camera, assegnando lettini tra loro molto distanti. Ho proposto io stessa una soluzione, penalizzante per noi ma che consentiva la vicinanza dei 3 lettini senza disturbare nessuno, ma ha piantato tante di quelle grane e negato ostinatamente ogni possibilità da costringerci a rivolgerci alla reception, che ha fatto intervenire il direttore (il quale si è scusato ed ha risolto in pochi minuti la querelle, peraltro ideando la stessa soluzione da me proposta inizialmente al bagnino)
Sono certamente cose non gravi, ma francamente sono proprio i particolari che distinguono l'eccellenza e in un 5 stelle l'eccellenza è d'obbligo
Nota da segnalare: immediatamente adiacente alla spiaggia dell'hotel c'è il ""bagno Cristina"", un piccolo stabilimento balneare nel cui ristorantino si può pranzare, mangiando in una piacevole verandina vista mare una buona cucina in stile casalingo verace, dove non mancano pesce e verdure di buona qualità e ben cucinate, a prezzi onesti. Segnalo la simpatia della titolare, un tantino invadente ma solare, e il rucolino, tipico liquore ischitano, con cui spesso consiglia di concludere il pranzo

05,Soggiorno fantastico,"Beh, si tratta di un Grand Hotel e quindi non c'è molto altro da aggiungere. E' stato un soggiorno fantastico: coccolati, serviti e accolti con tutti i crismi, cosa non sempre scontata anche in hotel di qs categoria. Camera: vista parco, ma vedevo anche il mare. Stanza enorme, pulita e con ogni comfort. Il personale gentilissimo, dal direttore (una persona squisita) all'autista della navetta che ci ha accompagnati al molo, passando per la reception, camerieri di sala e dei piani, chef, bar, ecc, tutti bravi e competenti. Il cibo è stato ottimo ed abbondante, sia a colazione che a cena, tra l'altro una delle due sere in cui abbiamo soggiornato c'è stato un cocktail di benvenuto offerto dall'hotel con cena gran galà e musica, uno spettacolo. Piscine in ottimo stato e ben curate, idem la spiaggia, siamo stati coccolati per tutto il tempo dal personale di spiaggia con grande premura. Cosa altro aggiungere: dovete solo andarci e toccare con mano ciò che ho provato in prima persona. Buon soggiorno!",5,2012,06,21
05,5 stelle reale per un'isola da 5 stelle,"Ho prenotato un soggiorno in questo hotel ai primi di giugno (264,00 euro stanza e colazione in due).
Complice il bel tempo ho potuto verificare anche i servizi spiaggia offerti.
All'arrivo siamo stati accolti dalla navetta dell'hotel al molo degli aliscafi ad Ischia (servizio offerto dall'hotel gratis).
Arrivati in albergo (meno di 10 minuti di tragitto con il vanette) siamo stati accolti in maniera calorosa da parte di Luigi (vice direttore) alla reception che, espletate le formalità di routine, ci ha accompagnato in stanza e ci ha spiegato strada facendo i diversi servizi dell'hotel.
Camera:
Avevo prenotato una confort vista parco nel corpo centrale ma dalla stanza si vedeva senza problemi anche il mare.
Stanza grande, luminosa, bel bagno grande, decisamente pulita e profumata.
Servizi:
piscine:
fantastica la piscina termale (32/35°), decisamente non piccola, con idromassaggi azionabili con pulsanti situati sul bordo; stando immersi si può vedere il castello aragonese ed i fiori del parco dell'hotel.
La piscina di acqua dolce era un poco fredda ma man mano che le temperature si riscalderanno deve essere ottima (è grande).
Aree dove prendere il sole:
Si può prendendere il sole sia vicino alla piscina termale che alla piscina di acqua dolce che sulla spiaggia dell'hotel (in ogni posizione c'è una vista molto bella). La spiaggia non è grande ma essendo su diversi livelli (a contatto con il mare comunque), ci sono molti ombrelloni. Si sta vicini ma non troppo.
Il personale di spiaggia è presente e i teli per asciugarsi vengono forniti senza limiti.
La colazione:
Orario: fino alle 10,30.
Ci si serve da soli (salvo che cmq il cameriere viene per sapere se occorre qualcosa), molto buona ed abbondante, dal dolce al salato. C'era anche lo champagne (tre bottiglie) nel cestello con il ghiaccio.
Vicino alla zona colazione/pranzo c'è un bar dove ad ogni orario si può fare una fuga dal sole, molto cortese ed attento il personale.
Non abbiamo cenato.
L'hotel è a 5 minuti a piedi dal corso principale.
Alla partenza ci hanno riaccompagnato con la navetta dell'hotel al porto (sempre gratis).
Che dire:
a mio giudizio promosso senza riserve.",5,2012,06,05

La disponibilità e gentilezza dello staff (non sempre scontata anche in strutture di rilievo...) e la premura con cui si sono preoccupati del mio bimbo, la location veramente degna di altri tempi, la cura dei particolari meritano veramente un plauso.

05,"Incantevole, confortevole, sorprendente: una vera parentesi di relax","In una posizione invidiabile e perfetta, con vista sul castello aragonese, direttamente sul mare e a un passo dalle vie dello shopping, l'hotel Punta Molino offre un servizio perfetto e personalizzato.
Completo di terme e Spa, con piscine termali, una all'aperto con vista mare e una coperta scavata nella roccia vulcanica, mette a disposizione degli ospiti personale altamente preparato e qualificato.
Ho passato delle giornate incredibili: al mattino presto, prima che l'antico borgo dei pescatori si svegli, passeggiata sul lungo mare accompagnata solo dall'alba (siamo ad est di Ischia),poi trattamenti termali, colazione ottima e ricercata ( ho chiesto il latte di soia e no problem, eccomi servita!) poi mare o piscina. Pomeriggio di nuovo trattamenti di bellezza  ( le estetiste sono molto brave!!), passeggiata in centro e cena, ottima, in albergo. La lista dei vini e' molto interessante, ho con l'occasione scoperto i vini DOC di Ischia: da provare!
Conclusione: vacanza perfetta, posto in cui ritornare. Un vero paradiso!!! 
Complimenti a tutti e grazie di cuore",5,2012,04,29

05,Semplicemente stupendo!,"Siamo stati mio marito ed io al punta molino per un long weekend. Tutto è stato ottimo: dall'accoglienza all'arrivo al porto dove ci aspettava l'auto dell'hotel, alla camera estremamente confortevole e curata ( una superior vista mare), al centro benessere dove siamo stati affidati alle cure di personale molto qualificato, alla spiaggia privata facilissima da raggiungere e ben attrezzata. Il nostro soggiorno è stato reso ancora più piacevole dal servizio molto attento e accurato che ha soddisfatto ogni nostra esigenza. Abbiamo scelto la formula mezza pensione: la ristorazione è davvero cinque stelle. Il buffet della prima colazione offre ogni genere di leccornie dolci e salate accompagnate anche dallo champagne; la sera il ristorante oltre ad un ricco buffet di antipasti e contorni offre un'ampia scelta di pietanze sia di cucina locale sia internazionale. Noi siamo arrivati di giovedì, il giorno del gala: abbiamo cenato a lume di candela sulla splendida terrazza con vista sul mare e sul castello aragonese allietati dallo spettacolo di due chansonnier che si sono esibiti in un repertorio partenopeo e non. Per concludere sono stati veramente quattro giorni di sogno. Ritorneremo presto! ",5,2011,09,21
05,tariffa 5 stelle ma 2 stelle,"la struttura è molto bella tuttavia la camera assegnata non era nemmeno da  un due stelle.

Non si poteva stare nemmeno con le finestre aperte per non essere travolti da odori culinari e rumori. Anche l'arredamento lasciava alquanto a desiderare...non c'era un copriletto uguale ad un altro, mobili in decadenza e bagno altrettanto.
Alle mie rimostranze, il concierge  si è rivelato persona arrogante e supponente. Conclusione...abbiamo dovuto cambiare hotel dopo solo una notte",2,2011,09,12

05,Kein 5 Sterne Hotel,"Es könnte ein schönes 3-4 Sterne Hotel sein, aber 5 Sterne und dann noch ein Leading Hotel of the World, das ist einfach zuviel des Guten. Man ist nett zu den Gästen aber nicht übermässig - manchmal hat man das Gefühl man stört die Herrschaften wenn man was verlangt. Das Essen im Restaurant ist langweilig ohne Recherche, ohne neuen Ideen.  Wenn man nach 20.00 Uhr kommt, sind die Antipasti-Platten leer und werden nicht mehr nachgefüllt, dann bleiben nur noch die industriell eingemachten Sachen. In irgendeiner Trattoria kann man besser und leckerer essen! Schade wegen der guten regionalen Produkte! Am Strand könnte es sauberer sein und es ist überall sehr eng. Im Spa wird man mürrisch bedient und es fehlt auch hier an Professionalität. Schade, denn die hätten alles um aus einem Urlaub etwas Besseres zu machen.",3,2011,04,18

della notte. Il servizio  è stato all’altezza delle nostre aspettative: tutto era perfettamente funzionale benché fossero prossimi alla chiusura stagionale.

05,elegante struttura,"Ho passato una settimana ad agosto e devo dire di essermi trovata molto bene. Ambiente molto elegante, clientela non giovane ma così c'è molta tranquillità.
La cucina normale, si mangia bene, ma sinceramente ti aspetteresti di più da un cinque stelle, non tanto per la quantità ma per la presentazione dei piatti; una cucina che non ti ricordi; la colazione da tre stelle, poca varietà di dolci, addirittura non c'è il tosta pane!!
A parte questo però è un ottimo albergo, molto tranquillo comodo in quanto è in parco privato e quindi c'è molto silenzio ma appena usciti siamo subito nella via principale dei negozi.
Sono stata bene e lo consiglio; ho preso una standard vista parco che però era spaziosa!!",4,2009,09,04

05,Super-Service,"Ein wunderbares Hotel um sich zu erholen, ein toller Service, Wünsche werden sofort erfüllt, ein hervoragendes Essen, das Abendessen (4 Gänge, davon 2 Gänge zum auswählen) verdient ein besonderes Lob, eine super Bedienung, wir waren rund herum zufrieden, hatten allerdings auch ein der schönsten Zimmer begucht, im 3. Stock, mit großer Terasse und einem traumhaften Blick auf das Meer und die Festung. Wir werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen. Wer Ruhe und Erholung sucht, ist in diesem Hotel, das zu Recht 5 Steren hat, richtig.

05,Erholung pur,"Wir waren sehr zufrieden.  Bei Halbpension wäre es wünschenswert, dass man statt Abendessen Mittagessen wählen könnte. Eine Morgengymnastik wäre wünschenswert. Der Strand ist sehr klein. Durch den Bademeisterservice gab es keinen Liegenreservierungskrieg.

05,Für ein 5 * Hotel eine Frechheit.,"Wir hatten uns für eines der angeblich ""weltbesten"" Hotel´s entschieden und auch kein Preislimit gesetzt. Was wir für unser gutes Geld bekamen war eine Unverschämtheit: Der Empfang war erwartungsgemäß stilvoll. Der Wagenmeister chauffierte unseren nagelneuen BMW X 5 ein und nannte uns den Stellplatz. Eine Dame begleitete uns zu unserem Zimmer und erläuterte die Modalitäten. Nachdem sie gegangen war, entdeckten wir auf dem Fußboden vor dem Bett abgeschnittene Fußnägel, man entschuldigte sich und ließ sie entfernen. Das Gras auf dem ungepflegten Balkon zu einer schmuddeligen Gasse mit viel Publikumsverkehr reklamierten wir gar nicht mehr. Beim Abendessen( immer eine Spitzenqualität ) bekamen wir zu einem erlesenen Rotwein ( Barolo 1998 - natürlich gesonderte Berechnung) zwei Gläser ""Modell Weinfest"". Erst auf Reklamation brachte man uns dann Rotweinkelche, jedoch in einer dicken, spülmaschinenfesten Ausführung. Auf Nachfrage verneinte man den Besitz von anderen Glasqualitäten. Diese Gläser standen dann jeden Abend auf unserem Tisch,während um uns herum die Gäste ihre teuren Weine aus Billiggläsern tranken und wir uns fragten, was für einen Lebensstli Leute pflegen die pro Woche und Person 1500Euro für ihre Unterkunft ausgeben aber sich mit solchem Glas zu - friedengeben. Die Handtücher in unserem Bad wurden täglich ausgetauscht, jedoch waren sie ausgefranst oder hatten gar Löcher. Wir haben bewußt nicht mehr reklamiert, weil wir vom Personal eines solchen ""Superhotels"" erwarten, daß alles stimmt und zwar ohne ständiges Nachhaken. Übrigens, Balkonbestuhlung wurde uns erst auf Verlangen gebracht. Über Qualität und Optik dieser Möbel brauch ich wohl nicht mehr zu berichten. Alles in allem - die 4* Sternehotelanlage "" Völlanerhof bei Lana, Südtirol, ist um mindestens eine Klasse besser.
In Zulunft passiert uns soviel Mangel für viel, viel Geld mit Sicherheit nicht mehr.",1,2007,07,27
