06,"A quiet, relaxing location.","We enjoyed our stay here, it was the end of our holiday and all we wanted to do was lie by the pool and relax and this was a great place to do it.
The hotel is very remote so you will need a car if you want to go to the local towns.
The pool is amazing with a great bar. There is a great selection of food and drinks available to eat around the pool. 
Our room was lovely with a great outdoor area.
The hotel restaurant had lovely food but the selection was very limited. The bar was really quiet with a big selection of drinks.",3,2023,09,10
06,"Wonderful, relaxed haven ","My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in August with our 10 month old baby. We could not have been better treated by everyone in the hotel. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were made to feel welcome so we easily relaxed into our stay. 

We had a standard king room  - the bed was huge and room easily big enough for the three of us and all the gear a new baby needs. 

The breakfast was great - good coffee, omelettes, cold meats and cheese, cereal, fruit and even the pastries were great (often a rare thing in hotels in my experience) 

We loved the bar by the ""pool"" perfect for an evening Aperol Spritz and ate twice in the restaurant. The restaurant is a great spot overlooking a gorgeous garden. 

We were in the area to visit family so only managed one day by the pool but it was a highlight of our trip. Again we were well looked after by the pool staff and were able to relax in the shade with our baby for ferragosto

I'd highly recommend the hotel, it's spacious without being overwhelming. it's a beautiful spot and the staff are fantastic. The service is attentive and friendly without being overbearing. 

We can't wait to go back. ",5,2023,09,01
06,You’re in for a lovely stay.,"Absolutely wonderful!  
Beautiful, clean, terrific service.
The bar service and restaurant service is classy.
The food at the restaurant was consistly good - chicken cutlets in lemon sauce, perfectly cooked steak over salad, French Fries (who knew), tiramisu 
on a delicious cookie, and excellent wine.  
Thank you for the experience.",5,2022,10,23
06,Fabulous!! A wonderful place!!,"We spent time here just by chance. It turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The facility was gorgeous…huge, green, beautifully maintained!!  Our rooms were lovely with balconies looking out over the property.  After long days of sightseeing it was wonderful to return to eat at their wonderful restaurant.  David, and Mauritzio  treated us like dear friends.  Marta at the front couldn’t have been sweeter
Tenuta Moreno has it all….so glad we found it",5,2022,10,20
06,one of the best location for your special events,"This resort offer you all the services you need to enjoy your vacation time or work-meeting.. Good place, swimming pool, good food, all the best that this part of Apulian Region can offer you. Big space for convention, excellent services ",5,2021,09,08
06,Puglia + hotel where weddings are celebrated  =  fantastic spot !,"Dream house, gardens, swimming pool and surroundings, beautiful rooms, quality local cooking.
Perfect location for a chill - or not - long stay.

An amazing space, so the sharing between « holiday travellers » and wedding guests is not disturbing, only leading to a few funny stategic talks  😉

11 nights juli-august. Great welcoming job in the restaurant from Davide and Pina, and at the pool from Claudia and the lifeguard.
Really everyone from the staff (all fields) is helpful, effective and friendly.

Nice experience to save in the favorites …",5,2021,08,14
06,Pleasant stay and perfect location,"Lovely hotel and perfect location for visiting some of the important places around.
Very big swimming pool. Nice garden. Helpful staff at he reception for making restaurant reservations in Mesagne. You need to rent a car to have the best time in Puglia in combination with this hotel. Only the restaurant prices are to high if you compare with all the nice restaurants in Mesagne.",4,2019,09,06
06,Fantastic,The hotel is amazing. Room is very large with balcony listen to thousand of birds singing in the morning and evening. The hotel is in the middle of a farm where they produce all their foods. The swimming is clean and big  and all the staff is really kind.,5,2019,07,04
06,"lovely place to spend the day ,"," if you need to share a swimming pool. Nice pool, grass to sit on, comfortable and enough sun beds. Reasonably safe for small children but they need watching. The food available was perfectly reasonable, and there were no queues on any of the four times we went. Not cheap but worth it.",4,2019,04,19
06,Comfortable but a bit cold,"Lovely, well maintained, expansive grounds dotted with ancient olive trees throughout. The hotel has a large lobby with various comfortable seating areas.
Rooms are very spacious and comfortable with a separate sitting area as well as an outdoor private terrace with additional seating.
Water bottles in the room are not complimentary and charged at an excessive Eur 3 per bottle. At that price, you’re better off stopping by a supermarket prior to reaching Tenuta Moreno and buying your own water bottles.
Breakfast buffet is extensive, varied, and tasty. The eggs were especially fresh. Outdoor seating is lovely while the indoor dining area near the buffet is devoid of all charm.",4,2019,02,07
06,Amazing stay at the Tenuta,"Me and my wife had a fantastic stay at the Tenuta Moreno; the place is beautifully located in the Alto Salento countryside, surrounded by olive trees and trulli. We enjoyed the warm weather sunbathing and swimming/chilling in the two pools (a larger one outside the hotel building and a smaller one, with pool bar, open-air but within the hotel building).
The room was a spacious, clean and well decorated double room. 
Recommended location for a relaxing holiday in Puglia.",4,2018,10,02
06,"""Quiet location in beautiful surroundings""","Nice and beautiful located hotel with marvellously pool. Large room with: safe, minibar and the opportunity to prepare coffee or tea. Wonderful shower illuminated with blue light. Perfectly equipped sanitary facilities, hair dryer, bidet, 
Breakfast was ok, fresh fruit, different types of bread, freshly squeezed orange juice.
Room was clean only the smell of bleach was troubling me.
Various sports can be practised including archery. Spacious parking area.",4,2018,09,04
06,11 days vacation stay :-) ,"First of all the hotel is nice located! It is easy to find via car and the hotel offers a lot of free parking spaces. The entrance area as well as the reception team is always welcoming you very nice! And I need to name one of the staff which did a very great job; it’s Marta! Always ready to support with a smile. The rooms are big and always very clean! The little balcony was very nice too. I was just missing some things:
Roomservice: A clear Menue in the room for small snack orders or a quick breakfast would be helpful for the staff as well as for the guests! I ordered several times the same but what I got was different sometimes! 
Restaurant: Very nice place to eat. The food was really great! But I was missing service with a smile. The guest came all at the same time, Sunday Dinner Menue, and all tables got the courses at the same time. I was ask at the beginning for drinks and then no more! When the plate was empty they took it and even not ask if all was ok, just from time to time! The head waiter seems a bit stressed! And one thing to add, I wanted to come for dinner but they just had fish in the Menue, the headwaiter told me no a la carte tonight! He was not even offering to check with the kitchen what is possible. For this hotel the kind of service needs to get improved! I ask at reception again, they tried to help, but due to communication we can not find a solution. So i Said i war outside and they said Ok. Not really professional. 
Spa: Very friendly and nice! I can really recommend to visit the team over there! Great massage and the spa is set up nice! 
Housekeeping: Very friendly and always on time. Thanks for the great work! Always very clean and supportive! 
Pool Area: Great To use. The bar was nice but no high standard! Food was ok, for easy snacks! ",4,2018,08,21
06,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel in beautiful extensive grounds. Large comfortable rooms with enormous king beds. TV, kettle, safe, good amount of storage. Shower over bath, bidet. Air conditioning effective. We had a front facing balcony which was huge. Good breakfast choice. We took a cycle ride around the grounds and noticed they raise their own chickens, herbs, vegetables and even bee hives. The pool is a large outdoor one with a bar attached that serves pool snacks and gives out pool towels. There was a wedding whilst we were staying which looked absolutely beautiful as it was held outside.
Extensive parking, close to brindisi airport
beds are very hard, shower over bath could do with a shower screen as floor gets wet, wifi could be better.
25 minute drive to Torre Gauceto beach,",4,2018,08,20
06,Perfect place for relax and refresh,"Large hotel property has football, tennis, two swimming pools, spa, garden.  Room is big and comfortable. Shower room has three type of showers with blue lighting such as hand type, top rain shower and water falls like which is very unique.  Restaurant is very delicate and Keen to use locals and thier own grown with quite reasonable prices as hotel.  Gym has saunas. Breakfast is ecellent especially it has a squeeze orage machine to give a truly fresh juice.
",5,2018,05,18
06,Amazing place,"This is a perfect place for events, high quality service and food. Also nice for a very exclusive dinner . The renewed typical buildings are beautiful , very huge garden with more then one swiingpool ... WOW factor",5,2017,10,05
06,Lovely hotel in a away from it all location,I attended a conference and the accomodation and meals were looked after by the organisers. The rooms were of good quality but unfortunately the bathroom did not have an independent shower. The three meals we had in the hotel were of high standard and the swimming pool and adjoining facilities together with the  spa facilities were also excellent. Parking area is vast within the hotel grounds.,4,2017,10,02
06,Okay stay in a dated masseria,"The grounds of this property are absolutely beautiful - wide expanses to explore inside a grove of ancient olive trees. The breakfast buffet was lovely and the setting (we sat outside on the patio) was perfect. Fellow travelers, you will understand my lament when I explain that we, unfortunately, got grandma's room. Perhaps there are nice rooms here but ours was just kind of run down and odd - a bed so large a family of four could sleep, except the mattress was so hard they could not - plus two twin beds on the side. Maybe it's a good value but there are other masserias in Puglia that I really enjoyed more.",4,2017,10,02
06,Couldn't sleep two consecutive nights,"I regret to say that this hotel does not deserve 4 stars. Actually I stayed there two nights and I could not sleep on both nights.

The main issue is the air conditioning system. It is water cooled, so every room has a machine inside the room in a false ceiling close to the entrance door and, when you turn it on, it's just like a vacuum cleaner working in the same room you're trying to sleep in. 
On the first night I talked to the concierge and he brought me to another room on the first floor: the noise was even louder, so I stayed in the hotel main room till 4:30 am. 
It is southern Italy, so it's hot in the summer, even at nights, so basically I had to choose between the vacuum cleaner and the hot summer air. 

There were other issues (i.e. door room not closing properly, had to pull it very strongly to get it closed) but none like the obsolete air conditioning system.

There are also good things (breakfast cakes for instance) but at the end of the day I would definitely not recommend this hotel.",2,2017,08,11
06,Wonderful full service hotel set in an olive orchard.,The property is set in a large quiet location off the main road. The rooms are very up to date. Part of the property was an old farm house which has been converted into beautiful public rooms The staff is very friendly and helpful. There are two large pools on the property which are great to have on hot days. The restaurant and pool bar are quite good. Breakfast room is quite large with a large array of breakfast items for most everyone's liking. Great place for a wedding or large conference/business meeting.,5,2017,07,29
06,Beautiful holiday,"We stayed at Tenuta Moreno as part of a group. The highlights were the food, potager garden and pool. We went for a lovely meal in Mesange but mostly we   had meals at the hotel. The food was outstanding and great to try the specialty wine and food from the region. The pool was perfect and great to have the bar to order drinks and      snacks whilst at the pool. The rooms are large but fairly dated. Staff were very helpful.",5,2017,07,28
06,Una bellissima settimana soleggiata!,"I could be quite brief about this place. To my standards, it's pretty close to perfection.

While the hotel may seem to be located in the middle of nowhere, it's very close to the Brindisi-Taranto highway and yet surprisingly peaceful. The buildings and grounds are gorgeous and very large. You can walk around them for an hour or more without getting bored. There is a huge pool, several beautiful gardens, an enormous parking lot (for our tiny rental car), and cute birds and lizards all over the place.

The room (127) was clean and spacious whith a small private terrace. Wi-fi coverage in the rooms and restaurant is not that great, but frankly we couldn't care less. We also couldn't quite figure out how to operate the A/C unit but still we managed to keep the room temperature at a steady 24 degrees C.

Hotel staff was very kind and helpful and the overall service was just great. They have free spa and wellness (which we didn't even try), free bicycles, free towels at the pool... There's a lovely bar outside the main building with a good selection of drinks and cocktails, and a small sunny pool bar.

But still I think the best thing of all is their restaurant. At the breakfast buffet, we found everything we needed to start the day. We stayed for seven nights on half board and they offered a brand new choice menu every night: antipasti buffet, five first and five main course choices, a small dessert buffet and a lovely selection of local wines. We Belgians love good food, and we were never disappointed.

Are you traveling to Puglia and thinking about staying at Tenuta Moreno? Just do it. You will not be disappointed, but if you are planning to stay for more than just a couple of days, get a rental car so you can explore the beautiful region.
",5,2017,06,06
06,Fabulous hotel and staff but limited choice for food,"We arrived late for a 4 night stay, and had previously arranged cheese, fruit bread and wine which was waiting for us in our rooms. The rooms are spacious enough, with good bathrooms and a small balcony. There is free WIFI throughout the hotel. Breakfast is continental and served in the range grove. Very peaceful and a plentiful selection of fruit, ham, cheese, cereal, pastries, etc. Fresh orange from the juicing machine is not to be missed! The pool is spectacular and quiet, and there is a small bar serving drinks and sandwiches. The lunch selection at the bar was quite limited, though well presented. The hotel restaurant for dinner is quite expensive compared to the restaurants in Mesagne, and to be honest the food is not as good. The pasta was fine, but the beef dish was quite fatty and stringy. We only dined there once, preferring the smaller restaurants in Mesagne which is 10 minutes away in a car. The staff were fantastic from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Overall a beautiful setting for a wonderful hotel, and maybe at the height of the season there would be more dining options.",4,2017,06,01
06,Gorgeous oasis of peace ,"Really stunning hotel and grounds with a fabulous large pool that is never busy. Always plenty of loungers and large beanbags to relax on. Small bar for snacks. Large gardens to walk around. Friendly staff and a very Italian breakfast outside in the orange grove with fresh juicers lots of cakes and pastries, cheese meats and an egg station. Lovely outside bar and small pool area. Lots of weddings - almost daily. Very close to Mesagne which has a lovely old town centre to walk round. Nice restaurant in town called Osteria del Vicoletto. Worth visiting Ostuni and Lecce. Alberobello and Carovigno. Wouldn't stay here for longer than a week as it is in the middle of countryside. Do not attempt to find it without Sat Nav and even then you need to input the latitude and longitude otherwise you will end up down a dirt track in an olive grove.  Very convenient for Brindisi airport on about twenty minutes away. Would return here it is very relaxing and a stunningly converted 17th century building and staff very helpful. Only a few English people here and in the area in general. ",5,2016,09,07
06,Doesn't fail to deliver time and time again,Great place to stay. Fantastic swimming pool and service. Attended a wedding there as well. Fantastic setting. Love the olive groves and the orangery. A real gem in the puglia countryside. I would highly recommend this place!,5,2016,08,30
06,A good choice in a Beautiful Area,This hotel has large  grounds and a very pretty setting. Rooms are nicely appointed and the staff is very friendly. Bed quality is excellent. The air-conditioning system seemed sub adequate despite it being not overly hot. Dinner at their restaurant was very good. Overall a good choice.,4,2016,06,04
06,Great hotel,Had a lovely stay here. Great room and bathroom. Brilliant pool with a small bar to grab those important Peronis from. The food was very well cooked and enjoyable and they were very flexible given we ended up arriving later than planned. Recommended.,4,2016,05,03
06,Unforgettable!,"My adult students and I spent a week at Tenuta Moreno and visited all magnificent towns such as Lecce,
Gallipoli, Otranto, Alberobello. Tenuta Moreno is a fantastic place.. All the staff were amazing! Food and wine absolutely delicious! Don't miss the opportunity to spend some time there!",5,2016,04,25
06,Loved our stay!,My husband and I stayed here for one night and loved the beautiful hotel and grounds - we walked around and admired every inch of the lush well kept gardens and pools around the hotel.  Our room was large and comfortable and walked to an outside terrace which overlooked the grounds.  The pool was lovely - my husband swam but it was too cold for me.  We stayed here on our travels between towns and it seemed rather remote but not far from Mesagne.  The décor was lovely as was the breakfast and dinner.  We certainly recommend this lovely hotel.,5,2015,12,29
06,Beautiful property for a relaxing oasis,"After a 40-mile cycling trip from Lecce to this location, this was a perfect stop. Had a 35 massage and relaxed in the spa area, that was beyond blissful. The grounds are well-maintained, my room was spacious with a great patio for tea or coffee. Comfortable bed and peaceful. The restaurant was also fantastic. The location is not close to anything of real excitement that I could tell, so its perfect for a relaxing, quiet getaway or a stop on a cycling trip through Puglia.",5,2015,10,20
06,Fabulous Hotel set in wonderful grounds,"The hotel is an absolute gem set in wonderful gardens with a fantastic pool area. The architecture of the hotel is amazing and the restoration is sympathetic to its past history and beauty, in combining the new with the old. The customer service was exceptional and of the highest quality and attention to customer service, especially Mareta, and her colleagues on reception. Also Luigi and colleagues on poolside bar/hotel bar and restaurant were excellent. The food was of the highest order and quality. This was our second stay at the hotel and we will be returning on many further visits in the future.",5,2015,10,04
06,Wonderful place for a vacation,"This is a beautifully kept hotel in extensive grounds with a spectacular swimming pool. The staff are polite and efficient, the food excellent. The breakfast buffet deserves special mention - fruit and vegetable juices, local specialities, freshly cooked omelettes. The rooms are spacious, with balconies (the ones facing inwards have mosquito nets, much appreciated). The only problem is the wifi coverage (but this is not the hotel's fault). The facilities round the pool are excellent - loungers, large cushions, a bar with very pleasant staff.",5,2015,09,01
06,what a way to relax but get a car,"Very nice hotel, really good pool area and very quiet. If you want to relax, this has to be one of the best places to do that.
Rooms are good but wi-fi access in the room is poor, the lobby is comfortable and large with good wi-fi.
It's very clean throughout and the staff are helpful. It also has a nice outside restaurant for breakfast and dinner with better than average food.
The poolside bar is nice with drinks and snacks and the staff are very friendly.
Drawbacks, dinner menu is very limited and theme nights take away choice but they do not give you another place to eat dinner, bar food would be useful in the evening.
There is nothing else to do in the area without a car, so if you want anything other than total relaxation, car hire is a must.",5,2015,07,24
06,Best customer service ever,This place was truly beautiful! Hotel was set in the most wonderful grounds and every view was breath taking. My husband and were so impressed by the food- we only needed the first course most nights- and as my husband is a chef that a big compliment! The staff could not do more for us and were so helpful- went above and beyond what we could have asked for! We will be visiting again for sure! ,5,2015,07,17
06,Wonderful birthday party,"We were  back to our favourite hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. Family and friends flew in from the uk for the birthday. The meal (banquet)was excellent so many fabulous courses finishing with a birthday cake. A big Thankyou to the chefs  , waiters etc. All the staff are so friendly and helpful the hotel runs like clockwork. It is so well managed by  Antonio , Isobel and Pierangelo . The reception staff  are  always so kind and helpful .especially Martha and  Perla . 
The hotel is sheer luxury .the gardens  are  beautiful . We enjoyed the swimming  pool as the weather was perfect . We also enjoyed superb breakfasts outside in the garden each morning. 
We look forward to our next visit .",5,2015,06,15
06,A real gem in Puglia,"Amazing hotel in an old authentic masseria where you walk through an orange grove or have your aperitivo sitting by a quiet stone paved pool. It's our third time in Tenuta Moreno and this time we had another nice surprice: more attention to details, new furniture and a vegetable garden. Our dinner was amazing and our expert and professional waiter, Gennaro presented and recommended what to order: we had il boccaccio, a fish soup cooked in boiling water!Delicious and hard to forget as the whole experience.",5,2015,05,03
06,Very quiet in February...,"Situated close to the SS7 and not to far to Brindisi, we chose this hotel due to its proximity to Brindisi airport and the towns of Alberbello, Ostuni and Matera. Reception staff were attentive and our room comfortable, but a bit dated. Expansive  and well kept public areas with very nice gardens. WiFi in bedroom with a few English TV news channels. This hotel is rather isolated and a car is essential, but we were were of aware of its location so quite happy overall. The main disappointment was breakfast: very limited selection due to the small number of guests staying at the hotel. This is understandable in order to reduce costs in the winter months.",4,2015,02,27
06,"Beautiful, luxury hotel in green surroundings !","Luxury, soundproof room (suite) with a special blue shower. Friendly staff. Ideal place from where you can discover Puglia; from Brindisi to Bari, from Alberobello to Lecce. You do need a car but we knew that in advance. Even Mesagne is charming town. Breakfast was rather basic but it was probably because it was already november, so low season and not that many guests.
For sure a hotel we would like to visit again in summer.",5,2014,11,16
06,Paradise,"This was our second stay at Tenuta Moreno. Throughout our four night stay all the staff were attentive, friendly and courteous. The hotel is peaceful with large indoor and outdoor areas in which to relax and enjoy tranquillity. Floral arrangements adorn all public areas and tables. The food is excellent and the choice very good, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, The wine selection is extensive. The vegetable garden is productive. The bedroom and all public areas are spacious and spotless. A big thank you to the management team of this very well appointed, luxurious hotel and we look forward to our next visit.",5,2014,10,22
06,Nice,"Nice hotel located in the middle of olive trees.
Very quite surroundings
Facilities are good, but not perfect. The rooms are very large
the hotel is in a point of time where they will have to make choice: wether they repair small broke, things or not. For example: a swimmongbool borderstone is broken but not paired, airco is not working properly, some light fittings are installed on the terrace but without light in in...

This hotel has much potential, it would be a shame to let this go

Moreover the food is from good quality but needs some variation. There was no alternatives for the pure italian food.

The spa was great, very clean and up to date.",4,2014,08,08
06,Nice hotel with amazing pool,"We stayed with 6 people 6 nights in this hotel in Mesagne, Puglia (south italy).
This rather big hotel (when you drive around the region, you see billboards reffering to this hotel everywhere) has everything to make your holiday a nice relaxing one with everything you need.
There is lots of choice for breakfast (large buffet)(eggs as well). Just make sure you eat before 9 am as thereafter you risk not having anything anymore (e.g no more croissants, no more fruit...) as they stop replacing the empty plates...
If you decide to eat in the hotel in the evening, make sure you are in time as well as otherwise you risk the same thing as with the breakfast (we went at 8 pm and were left with an empty buffet...). There is a nice town close by though (10 min by car) with plenty of restaurants.
The hotel staff is very friendly and also helps you without a problem with tips for local good restraurants. I would definitely only take hotel + breakfast (not including dinner)(this is also what we did).
The rooms are spacious with airco, hairdryer, decent bathroom, large beds (hard matras though).
Some rooms have a problem with the airco, but the staff easily helps out.
The swimming pool is really really nice (picture right out of a catalogue). 
Overall, very nice hotel. The organisation could be a bit better though, but I think they have sometimes too much on their mind as they had virtually every evening a wedding party taking place while we were there too.
On that note, it is sometimes a bit bizar if you walk in your swimshort while the wedding party guests are there next to you fully dressed up... It would be better if these locations were better split up.
Wifi was only available at the reception. It did not reach far enough to get access in the rooms or at the pools.",4,2014,08,08
06,Amazing place,"I've spent three nights here. It was amazing. This is a superb and really quite location. Excellent food and service.  I've tried so many Italian dishes. Great choice of vine.
I'll be back one day for sure. :)",5,2014,08,06
06,Fantastic,"Superb location, even if you need a car to be able to move. Fantastic mixture of old stones and modern equipments. Superb personnel (grazie Emanuella and the other receptionists, grazie Luigi, Lorenzo and their colleagues at the bar and the swimming pool), they all made our stay unforgettable. Super nice breakfast with fresh orange juice and juice extractor for carrots and apples. AND GREAT ITALIAN COFFEE! BIG swimming pool where you can lie under the palm trees for some shade. PARADISE on earth!!!",5,2014,06,17
06,Excellent,"We spent two nights in this wonderful hotel. The accommodation is fantastic . It is a very tranquil residence the grounds are beautifully kept with wonderful flower arrangements throughout the hotel  . All the staff are very friendly and helpful including the directors, reception staff , waiters , cleaners etc. the room we had was very spacious with contemporary fixtures amazing shower and a pleasant sitting area outside the room. 
The meals were of a very high quality and beautifully presented . ",5,2014,05,15
06,Hidden gem!,Our son stayed here 6 months working for Boeing.  We visited while he was here.  Facilities and staff were top notch!  Could not ask for any better accommodations or friendlier staff.  Weddings seemed a daily occurrence-Loved to see the brides & the fireworks!  Would go back in minute.,5,2014,02,08
06,Excellent!,"I stayed here on business and it was brilliant. In total, I have stayed in this hotel for over 6 weeks and every stay was excellent and had great staff, service, food, and rooms. I would highly recommend it if you're visiting the area...and try the Selvarossa wine too.",5,2013,12,18
06,Quiet and out of the way,Beautiful hotel. Appreciate it was out of season but the menu in the restaurant was very limited. Poolside bar was idyllic and the sauna and spa a welcome treat. Would have loved to  have spent more time there.   Staff very helpful considering how many off us checked in at the same time ! ,4,2013,11,05
06,tenuta moreno,"Super! Beautiful swimming pool! Nice bar! A bit far from everything! Good service! Good food and good meals (a bit too much in half-pension!). Nice sites to visit around (Brindisi, Lecce, Galipoli, Monopoli, Alberobello, Ostuni, Carovigno...)",5,2013,09,04
06,Lovely location outside of  town,"This is a huge complex outside of the little town.  Because of the size, they are able to accommodate large tours.  Four were there while we were.  However, despite the size and large groups, we still felt special and never had to wait for service or food.   They seem to have plenty of waitstaff and our group  aways had our own space.  The breakfast buffet is large and you can also order eggs however you want them.  Staff speak English and are always pleasant and helpful.  There are two pools but we were too early in the season to enjoy them.  One member of our group rented a bicycle for 5 euros to ride around the countryside on paths recommended by the staff.  My room was very large but my ""balcony"" was a narrow concrete corridor to a screened barrier to a small garden with no chairs and a very limited view.  The only disappointing part of my stay.

Also unlike other hotels we stayed at, this place actually had internet that worked in my room.",5,2013,04,21
06,Excellent place,"I think it's one of the best place in Puglia.
The location is fantastic, the restaurant is at the top. A very well organized place in the country of Mesagne, only 2 minutes drive from the highway, 15 from the Airport. I spend my spare time with my family every time we can, in summer, and to celebrate birthdays, Christamas, Easter, etc. 
The facility has been recently renovated. It's wonderful.
The SPA is excellent, very clean and relaxing. The two ladies who manage the center are very professional and kind.
The pool is huge!!!
If you are planning to visit Puglia, don't surf in the internet to find another place, go there right now. I strongly reccommend Tenuta Moreno.",5,2013,03,19
06,Wonderful Resort,"I traveled into here on advice from a co-worker.  Wonderful hotel and staff.  The room was very large and inviting.  Having never been to Europe, I was shocked.  The morning breakfast was nice and simple and the dinner menu was full.  The food and service was top-notch!!  Only drawback is that the resort is off the beaten track.  If you are looking for a place to stay and move about, this is it.",4,2012,12,02
06,A lovely country retreat,"I have stayed in the hotel several times, the latest being a week from the 21st August 2012. A lot of thought, care and attention has gone into creating this hotel, for me the rating is definitely worthy of 4* and more. This extends from the outside to the inside, from the clean lines of the bedrooms and modern bathrooms with top quality toiletries, to the bars and restaurants.

Inside is cool, calm and airy, the stylish main building a good mix of traditional and modern, beautiful tiles and lighting. Outside: spacious terraces and balconies, beautiful grounds with various fruit trees and palms; vegetables and herbs, in a well laid out garden, which are used in the kitchen; an elegant swimming pool with a lifeguard. The various function rooms around the complex do not seem to cause disturbance to the other guests.

As in any international hotel you will hear many languages spoken, but in my experience the tour groups are not overwhelming, though it might be helpful to other guests if the group-advertised trips and events indicated whether they are open to all or for that group only. The hotel also benefits from a multi-lingual library. Nonetheless I met and spoke to several Italian guests who actually lived fairly close to the hotel and were enjoying being home from home. English is spoken; particularly well in reception, but any staff member with lesser skill in dealing with complex matters would always quickly find somebody who could help.

As in any eco-minded hotel, sheets and towels are changed when the guest indicates. The eco-credentials extend to not poisoning the immediate environment. I was pleased to see and hear a range of birds flying in the gardens and see several species of butterfly. As a consequence one is likely to encounter the occasional fly in the open-air bars and restaurants, but fortunately they were not large or a big nuisance, they were most noticeable at the end of breakfast if you were the last people left in the dining area. Since the hotel is situated in a vast area of fruit and nut orchards, co-existing with all god’s creatures is not a big risk and I’m sure the environmentally sensitive hotel is a big draw for most guests.

I don’t need a lot of pomp and fuss; and excess facilities and services when I just want to relax.",5,2012,09,25
06,Nice place to relax,"This is the first time we stayed in this hotel and we would certainly come back. I even recommend it to friends and family. Very friendly and helpfull staff.(the manager was there for any questions, showing around, touristic information,...she made you feel very welcome)
Food was excellent and we had plenty of choice. The dining area outside was enchanting as well the one inside, we ate in the winecellar between the primitivo's and the barrollo's. They serve delicious local wines at a very democratic price. The rooms were spacious, but a little outdated. 
The wellness facilities are clean and very enjoyable as well as the outside pool.
If you like to visit, you will need a rental car.",5,2012,09,17
06,Enchanting location,"This is the third time I'm visiting la Tenuta Moreno in the charming Salento region.I must say that the accomodation provided by this hotel has always been of the highest level. I travel frequently and I must say this is one of the most relaxing spots I've ever encountered. What I find amazing about this place is the friendly and warm welcome I receive whenever I stay at the Tenuta Moreno. It's as if I'm practically home. The ambience at the Tenuta is just wonderful. You're surrounded by olive trees and enchanting countryside; this is complemented with superb facilities at the Tenuta Moreno...a huge pool, a very good spa resort, and most important of all, very spacious rooms with huge bathrooms. If you're leading a stressful life, this is the place where you have to head to, in order to unwined. The last but not the least, the culinary aspect. The food has always been a fantastic experience with local products derived from the lands surrounding the said hotel.  ",5,2012,08,24
06,Great location for Weddings,"Very nice hotel with a large pool. great breakfast with a variety of fresh products. Amazing wedding facilities and friendly staff. the rooms a very large and fully equipped with A/C, minibar, safe, shutle service to the nearest town mesagne.",4,2012,08,09
06,What a nice surprise!,"The resort is located in a secluded area in the middle of Puglia's countryside. It is so isolated that sometimes there is no signal on your mobile phone in some of the rooms. This makes it is a perfect retreat from chaotic life and definitely a win.

That said, it is self-evident that you must have a car to move around if you do not wish to bust your wallet with taxis. If you like to enjoy the place, the hotel has all the comforts you need, including a beautiful swimming pool.  The morning breakfast buffet is outstanding and the food at the restaurant is simply superb. I really had a couple of memorable meals.

The rooms however are not much inspiring.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with them, but they look rather anonymous, old-styled and somewhat ""cheap"" in such a nice environment. The price is right.",4,2011,08,06
06,Pleasant resort in the middle of the countryside,"We stayed here with a group including extended family for four nights. It was our base to explore other areas of southern Italy. We enjoyed the pool and spa facilities.  Our room was large and clean but had a musky (mildew?) odor. The other rooms in our group were fine. We didn't switch rooms because it was bearable and we wanted to be near our family. The food and service were very good; we had all of our meals here.  We especially enjoyed the breakfast. For such a remote region, the hotel had a surprising amount of guests and activities which made it feel lively.  The restaurant and bar staff were especially kind and accommodating.",4,2011,07,28
06,A Wonderful Stay in Apulia,"My wife and I stayed at the Tenuta Moreno for 4 days in June 2011 along with a small group on an escorted tour. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful and the pool outstanding. The food was good, not great. The location could not have been better for our tour plans. 

The drawback was our mixed emotions about the rooms. Large but aged and very dark. It felt like we were in a cave. The bathrooms we bright and large. 

The front desk was a mixed bag. Generally, very grumpy but serviceable.",3,2011,07,03
06,Oasis in the Middle of Nowhere,"This is a beautiful property and is great for the person who sees it as a destination rather than a place from which to explore Puglia.  It is out in the country and therefore, the only way to get around to see the area is by car or tour bus.  Fortunately, we were with a tour and so we were taken to Lecce, Alberobello, Ostuni, etc.  However, we were stuck there for dinner all four nights and, while the food was OK, I would have preferred to have stayed in a town where we could have had dinner at a local trattoria and walked around the area.  (a taxi to Brindisi cost 40 euro each way). The pool and grounds are beautiful (see photos) and our room was first class.  The staff in all areas of the hotel were friendly and helpful.  Tenuta Moreno is a great spot for a family travelling with kids because of the wonderful pool and other activities.  If you stay here with the goal of exploring the trullis of Alberobello, the baroque architecture of Lecce or visiting one of many farms in Puglia, you must have a car.",4,2011,07,02
06,"Excellent hotel, countryside location","The hotel is very big and so are the rooms, The pool is one of the biggest I've seen
The gardens and settings are fantastic
Staff are polite and speak little English
I would recommend going into Mesagne to eat as you will get better food and better value
Overall an excellent place to stay",4,2010,08,02
06,beautiful hotel,"ive stayed there a few times now and this is a really beautiful property.  the grounds are lovely, the pool is SPECTACULAR, the restaurant is nice and accomodating.

if you want a lovely getaway vacation in Puglia, it is the place to go.

the only things that would improve this hotel would be a gym and free internet.",5,2009,09,03
06,Excellent Stay,"We stayed for 5 nights at this hotel and had a great time. The service was outstanding,friendly and welcoming as well as very helpful. They enabled us to spend a day in Lecce using trains and the hotels shuttle bus which was great fun and saved a hairy drive. We were especially grateful for the local knowledge in buying the train ticket which was not as straight forward as we'd expected.
The pool and restaurant were of a very high standard and although the decor and design of the room was fairly standard the balcony was great and the room was well kept and equipped.",4,2009,08,14
06,A Hidden Jewell,"I have had the oportunity to have stayed here four times this year from deepest January until steaming May and I think that the company I work for has truly descovered a hidden jewell. 
OK so first impressions (in the dark) in January were a little discoloured as there was a distinct lack of atmosphere, and the only guests were my colleagues! But hey, this is the same wherever you go in the region, however I found the staff more than helpful and the quality of service from the management to the cleaners was first class, and I quickly realised that this would develope in subsequent visits.
The air conditioned rooms are very spacious, clean and tidy with balconies.
Take time out to explore the grounds - they are massive with something for everyone including manicured lawns, terraces, a range of water features, large and small pools, tennis and a small soccer pitch - and it will become apparent why this hotel is used extensively for well to do weddings and parties, but the service does not alter whoever you are and whatever the question. 
There is varied cuisine to be had both in the resturaunt and around the various pool bars-just ask if you fancy something else.
My subsequent visits have seen the hotel really blossom along with the countryside, and in reply to those who complain that ""nothing is in English""...why don't you take time out to learn a little Italian? Afterall not everyone speaks Italian in my neck of the woods! You will soon find that a bit of effort goes a long way. I have found the staff to have a real professional approach with humour in a range of languages.
 The wine selection is excellent (please try the Selvarossa even at 15 euros a pop) and the reaturaunt staff are more than competant to deal with most questions.
If you are fortunate to stay while they are hosting a wedding then boy, will you find out how to really push the boat out from the preparation to the finish.
You do need a car though, and why not as it really does push you out there to explore the Puglie region (try to get to Otranto and Lecce)

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!",5,2009,08,08
06,superb masseria with a friendly smile,"2nd time we stayed at the Tenuta Moreno (2004, and now). The food is delicious and authentic, the staff are very child friendly, and frankly speaking the only hotel in the world (having been to many...) where the hotel manager is visibly present every (!) day, greeting guests personally every day. The quiet pool is discrete, sheltered and offer privacy, the main pool is a children's best dream, with plenty of deck chairs, shadowy places that still offer a good overview of the pool. The rooms are very spacious. We took the family room for 4. All rooms have a private terrace as well. There is also a playing area for children, and the whole place is well-kept and maintained. The rastaurant has a large garden with orange trees, so kids can play while parents enjoy their meal.  A definite recommendation, I have already sent many friends there !",5,2009,07,16
06,Comfortable for one night,"My husband and I were bicycling around Puglia and chose the Grand Hotel Tenuta Moreno because of its location -- it was the right distance between our prior night in Savelletri and our next stop in Lecce.  It is in the middle of nowhere so to speak, although I can see why it is used for conventions and weddings -- it's right off the highway and has a lot of facilities.  It is several miles outside Mesagne, which by the way has a very lovely central square and beautiful cathedral.  

We were initially surprised when we arrived -- a sprawling property and on a Sunday afternoon there were multiple parties going on at once.  However, we were greeted nicely (which is saying something, since we arrive on bicycle!), a bellboy went out of his way to help us put the bikes in a safe storage area, and the front desk staff were very pleasant.  She even said that once we had cleaned up, she would take us to the bar for a complimentary drink.

The hotel is furnished attractively in the lobbies and hallways; our room (deluxe?) was very large (clearly appropriate for a family) and had a little private terrace, and very clean (tile floor, nice bathroom) but it's pretty sterile -- desk, beds, chair -- nothing upholstered and the bedspreads, curtains etc were not very attractive.  

Still, when we did clean up and returned to the front desk, a woman took us on a tour of the property, explained why there were so many functions, and promised it would be quieter in the evening.  She took us to the bar at the pool and we enjoyed a very lovely area and great drink.  Later that evening, we ate in the hotel restaurant and found it more than satisfactory.  It's an attractive room, although the lighting is too bright, and we had very good service and a very tasty meal.  Maybe not big on ""atmosphere"", but it was very nice.  Breakfast the next morning was an enormous buffet and we found that platters were filled or replaced very promptly.  (Coffee service was odd though -- we had to chase down a waitress to order what we wanted and she never came back.)

All in all, it was a comfortable night and convenient for us.  However, given all the other interesting, small, personal hotels we used during the rest of the trip, I would not choose the Grant Hotel except if the location was convenient.  To my surprise, it seemed that some guests were staying for multiple nights or a whole week -- there are MUCH more atmostpheric places to stay in the lovely towns of Ostuni, Martina Franca, Alberobello or Lecce.  It's not a bad place, just not very memorable and more for tour groups.",3,2009,06,18
06,que bella,"Not sure what the other reviews that claim unfriendly staff are about.  I spent 10 days here and had no problems.  The staff is as friendly as I like staff to be. They're not fawning and obsequious, but will serve you well.  They cater to your needs, but probably not to whims.  If it can be done, they'll do it for you.  The grounds are simply spectacular and the location is in the boonies a bit.  We had a car, so we found it peaceful and quiet. The food was very good and the wait staff well trained.  The room we had was comfortable and very clean, although the bed was a bit hard for my taste. 

My only down side was that I got there before the pool was open.  They didn't fill it until two days before I left.  I did get to use it, though, and it is a beautiful pool with shaded areas and sunny spots.  The only thing I could have asked for was more time. I love this hotel and would definitely go again.",5,2009,05,27
06,just an illusion,"nothing good for us...orrible rooms, not good food, staff arrogance....never again here.
we book for 3 days we start the 2th",2,2009,03,30
06,fantastic place to Stay,"The company I work for has had a number of people stay at this hotel, over a number of weeks.  Personally, I stayed here for 15 days, and some guys over 1 month.

The staff are fantastic, and have helped all of us learn and develop our Italian.  Every single day, both morning and night, we have had greetings and salutations.  It has been a pleasure to be served by these guys - especially Luigi and Adolfo!  One of the team has had the same room over a number of weeks, and any laundry left has been put back in his room while he returned to England.  Thats the actions of people who want to help you have a comfortable stay!

The grounds are fantastic and even have oranges on the tree's as I write.  There are no noises at all from traffic or aircraft, so its a really relaxing place.

Location is good for Brindisi airport, and taranto - but a car is advisable, because the hotel is in the middle of nowhere!

The food is varied, with traditional Italian food served, and a menu which is never the same for two days.

If you want an authentic Italian stay - come to this place - its fantsatic.  If you want to be served on, hand and foot, and people who speak perfect English, stay at home!

This is good, honest, Italian culture - and i love it!",5,2008,11,28
06,Unfriendly staff and too expensive for what you get,"This hotel has beautiful grounds.  That is the only positive.  From the Brindisi airport, the hotel was a 60 Euro, 20 minute cab ride.  Ouch.  Nothing is close so a car is essential.  The staff was mediocre at best.  Any question to them elicited a frown and why-are-you-bothering-me look.   It took more than a day for staff to clean up after a large wedding party.  The rooms are fairly large and some have balconies.  However, for the same money, much more pleasant accomodations exist.",2,2008,10,23
06,"Fabulous complex, mediocre staff","We have just spent a week here. The buildings and grounds are absolutely gorgeous and well-tended and the pool is simply the best we have ever been to. Our room was spacious, well-appointed and had a huge balcony. However, the staff left a lot to be desired with the exception of Luigi the barman who was very friendly and efficient.  On arrival we were met by surly staff at reception who spoke little or no English. There were newspapers and folders in German and Dutch but nothing in English. The reception staff were more interested in chatting to each other than trying to assist. The piped music at reception was also off-putting. There was absolutely no information in the room other than a card about using the telephone and it was like pulling teeth to find out about the restaurant, swimming pool opening times, laundry service etc etc. There were weddings almost every day and sometimes we could not get access to all of the public areas although the firework displays were a bonus. I saw 2 cats sitting on the top table one day - ugh!!!!

At breakfast we often had to go in search of coffee/tea as the waiters were standing around chatting instead of acknowledging people.  No-one said good morning and no matter what time we came down there was always something missing eg no cold meat or no cheese or on one occasion no plates or spoons!!! There was frequently no cloth to put over the bread resulting in everyone  handling the bread as they cut slices!!!! The chef did cook breakfasts to order and in fairness they were very good.

We used the restaurant in the evening several times but were not impressed. We ate outside in a very attractive area and candles on the tables and soft lighting added to the effect. The food was bland, often cold and not the standard we had expected of a hotel of this quality and we were very disappointed. Again although the restaurant was not particularly busy we had to wait for menus and drinks for up to 15 minutes on occasion. We also objected strongly to the 6 feral cats/kittens which were running around the tables, jumping on to chairs and clawing at our legs. In our opinion the management should have done something about this. This to us was unacceptable and we complained about it but nothing was done. On talking to fellow guests we discovered that others shared our views. We went into Mesagne (the nearest town) twice and had superb food at half the price.

The pool area was wonderful but again the pool bar seemed to open at a different time every day and on 2 occasions we could not get towels until 11am!!!! Nevertheless we greatly enjoyed this area.

When we checked out we paid our considerable bill and did not receive one word of thanks, nor were we asked if we had enjoyed our stay, wished a safe onward journey or any of the usual pleasantries. The receptionist had enough English to do this.  She was conducting a conversation with a colleague whilst processing our bill and did not make eye contact once. 

It is a great shame as the Tenuta Moreno has superb facilities and a fabulous setting. It was coming to the end of the season and it showed!!!!!",2,2008,09,14
06,Brilliant holiday!,"Friends of ours got married near by and the bride suggested we stay here for a couple of nights after the wedding - we decided to stay for 4 days/nights after the wedding and we did not regret it!

Although it was abit out of the way (you really should get a car or have some form of transport if you want to get out and about), it was absolutely fabulous for us, as we wanted to relax by the pool, and eat good food. 

We had the opportunity to have dinner there on the last night and it was brilliant - very fresh seafood, very reasonably priced and all in all, a good deal. Note, you don't have to have the 'entire course' of antipasti, first course of pasta and 2nd course of a meat dish. You can do it ala-carte style. 

It's about 20 minutes from Brindisi airport so it's a good getaway if you fly RyanAir and pop round to this hotel for a few days r&r.

Those of you who are planning a wedding in Italy - I wouldn't know anything about the legal aspects, but if you want a beautiful reception with lots and lots and lots of lovely food and a great time, you should contact these people. It was very elegant, very beautiful and they appeared to cater a very personal service. They can hold weddings at either this hotel, or their sister restaurant Casa Resta!

06,Very friendly hotel with good food and a nice ambience,"The staff is always very professional, friendly and competent. The entire hotel is very clean. The rooms are very nicely designed and decorated in a southern colonial style. Each room has a beautiful balcony overlooking a green courtyard. Each balcony has a closed mosquito net. The beds and pillows are comfortable and the sleep quality is very good. Breakfast is sufficient: There are various cakes, breads, confectionery and div. Cold cuts. Hot dishes such as omelettes are freshly prepared. Dinner is very good. On the menu there are four starters and four main courses to choose from every evening. The service is always very competent and friendly. The wine list leaves nothing to be desired. After dinner you can spend a few hours in the bar with a cocktail. The Long Island Ice Tea is highly recommended and the cappucino is an absolute highlight. The hotel is a bit off the beaten track near Mesagne. A rental car is an absolute must. The Autostradas are easy to reach the cities of Bari, Brindisi, Matera and Gallipoli. The hotel has a wellness area with very friendly and competent staff. We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely go there again.",5,2024,10,07

06,Bad is to say the least!!!,"Unfortunately, there is no superlative of the superlative PESSIMO.
A nightmare wedding!
Upon arrival (and specifically just arrived) we asked for fried food, the lady replied, verbatim words and with a tone of reproach ""But how many fried food are you eating, there are people who have eaten three, four in a row, then you sit at the table and eat nothing! "" Shocked we did not respond, after that invite us to move, a nice path to do on foot under the pergola, the only positive note... we sit.
They open the buffet, which for 175 people I would have advised against warmly, but forget it. He approached me at the table and on a plate c was ""piled"" in a terrifying way of carpaccio swordfish and unseasoned tuna that were pitiful, I try to take two slices with a fork and a gentleman, who surely wanted to be kind and who wore the glove that you wear to open the various seafood, grabs with this glove the slices of carpaccio and puts them on the plate, horrific! Soft fish frying, poorly seasoned cuttlefish, crescentine with the smell of cured meats on top, greasy and very hard, shrimp wrapped in phyllo dough that seemed manipulated a lot... boiled octopus, not uncooked roast...salmon in industrial quantities, was everywhere, in all courses... the first arrives, served in vessel-shaped dishes, too bad they were ravioli and it was difficult to get to the bottom of the plate the fork to cut them...ah, in the meantime at our table there were three high chairs and the children had the first after some time and at the urging of their parents, the orecchiette were glued and little seasoned, you could clearly see that they had not been made at the time; the cutlets when they arrived, alas could not be cut, because the waiters had cleared and there were no knives, which were asked several times, they arrived after more than 20 minutes and the cutlets had become soles of shoes, moral the children did not eat!
After the first, we needed to go to the toilet, which was very far from the place of the reception and which was actually that of the lobby, at the service of the guests of the accommodation facility: a bathroom for men and one for women, and 175 guests I say no more... when we returned to the table the first seconds had been taken away because we were not seated, now the bathroom was 150 meters away to the round trip, only one bathroom available for women and one for men, time has passed... I forgot, in the clearing of the appetizer I got an elbow in the forehead... sitting at the table we wait for the second, but we realize that for the other tables had arrived the sorbet, practically at our table had never arrived, we point out and arrives the second along with the sorbet now gone, liquefied under and foamy on top, like beer poured badly, the only thing I ate had not carved abdomen, we all had difficulty cleaning it... very tired my husband and I sit by the pool and feel a parapiglia had left the hydrants, children and adults wet!
Moment of cutting the cake is not served sparkling wine to guests, toasted only the bride and groom, puff pastry in desserts now soaked, also because like the cake I suppose they were out for some time... last but not least the metal chairs ruined my satin skirt.
Ahh and the baby-sitters did not take 3/4 year olds who were the ones who needed entertainment, I suppose because the recreation area was far from the reception, in fact the mothers of the little ones were forced to long absences. 
Better not approximate!!!
That's too bad.

found availability at Tenuta Moreno. Just arrived we are greeted by two beautiful dogs Filippo and Morena but above all the beauty of the location, surrounded by the greenery of olive trees and figs of Puglia, with fountains and walls typical of Lecce stone ..... in short, a paradise. The kindness and professionalism of all the staff, the reception staff, the waiters in the breakfast room, restaurant and bar, the ladies cleaning the rooms .... in short, there is perfection .",5,2024,08,24

06,Absolutely not up to what you pay,"We decided to spend a weekend in this structure, very beautiful and pleasant to look at. However, all that glitters is not always gold. Beautiful and spacious room, so modern in style that there weren't even any bedside tables, so much so that to place something on it we had to move a chair closer to the bed. But that's the least of it. From a particularly elegant hotel we would have expected a breakfast consistent with the luxury of the Masseria. Another disappointment: almost nothing salty, in fact absolutely nothing if we exclude the ""eggs"" corner where they prepared omelettes which were a real omelette, not at all exciting. Not to mention the dinner, included in the expensive package purchased: frozen seafood salad; meat ordered rare and arrived very cooked; poor quality fried calamari. The waiter who served us had told us that the chef would match the side dishes. Well, one of the surroundings did not arrive. In short, for what we paid it wasn't worth it",2,2023,11,05
06,A pleasant certainty!,"Tenuta Moreno is for me, as for my family, a place that feels like home and above all a certainty for our anniversaries.

Our expectations.
This time we had the
Nice to have Settimio leading the dining room team, a very pleasant person as well as the rest of the staff.
For me, a smile is essential for an ideal festive atmosphere and it is what they never lack.
In addition to the impeccable quality of each dish, I would like to pay particular praise to the cake and desserts which I LOVE! Nun tits and naked cake ♥️ Top Top!

06,Excellent location but to be revisited,"we returned after 11 years to this resort which surprised us with its careful management. The estate is always very beautiful but the organization including the
Restaurant is no longer as before
The reception was kind in replacing our room with a more comfortable one

Bicycle available out of use, swimming pool beautiful but with little maintenance, hydromassage not working and shower closed

Un grazie speciale va al Signor Pierangelo Argentieri, che ci ha guidato e consigliato offrendoci tutta la sua esperienza nel campo, un professionista dai gusti eleganti e raffinati, che ha colto in pieno cosa volevamo già dal primo colloquio e si è messo a nostra disposizione come pochi direttori fanno; un grazie di cuore va anche a tutti i collaboratori della tenuta, ci sentiamo di ringraziarli davvero tutti, in particolar modo Daniela che ci ha seguito egregiamente, mettendoci a nostro agio. La tenuta nel nostro giorno si è presentata curatissima, nulla era lasciato al caso, impeccabile il servizio in tutte le location; Hanno avuto 1000 occhi per i nostri ospiti riscuotendo i complimenti da ogni singolo invitato. Le portate erano di primissima qualità, il servizio eccellente. Che dire...li risceglieremmo altre milioni di volte, è stato un successone. Grazie da Andrea e Valentina",5,2023,05,25
06,Sicurezza zero ,Ideale per tornare a casa in sedia a rotelle. La sicurezza è meno di un optional. Servizio abbastanza serio ma per il resto è semplicemente uno scandalo. E il peggio che si fanno anche la ragione. Mai più. ,1,2023,05,21
06,Bella location moderna,"Ottima location nella campagna pugliese, struttura moderna e spaziosa con area Spa il cui costo di accesso 40 eu, ampie le camere e gli spazi comuni, parcheggio interno spazioso, ottima qualità al ristorante, le camere affacciano su un giardino interno, silenziose",4,2023,04,16
06,Costi eccessivamente esagerati……..!!!!,"La tenuta è molto bella spaziosa con molto verde e una meravigliosa piscina sempre pulita
La nostra camera comoda, il bagno ancora con vasca era  cieco, il letto matrimoniale abbastanza comodo si apriva nel mezzo, bastava un topper per risolvere il problema, da rivedere la pulizia  in camera sempre con molta polvere sui mobili…….
Il personale in sala e al bar era meraviglioso sempre disponibile e sorridente tranne la signora alla reception……….
Il cibo buono , ma estremamente costoso…….tipo frutta mista €10 , dolci al mini buffet €10 anche se prendivi solo una fetta di torta o due pasticcini…..
Al bar idem…… un panino dai €10  ai 13 €….. assurdo senza parlare delle bevande e alcolici…
Da controllare il conto finale…….
Personalmente non ci tornerei , nella zona ci sono molte altre masserie e tenute 
Costo alto!!!",3,2022,08,16
06,Matrimonio da sogno,"Ci siamo sposati il 10.08.22 è stato semplicemente un sogno. Tenuta Moreno è stata fin da subito la nostra prima scelta e non ci sbagliavamo. Cibo ottimo, servizio impeccabile. Daniela la nostra wedding planen è stata molto gentile e disponibile ha realizzato ogni nostro desiderio. Il personale professionale e disponibile. Ci hanno fatto vivere davvero una giornata indimenticabile.",5,2022,08,14
06,Notte da incubo,"Abbiamo pernottato un sola notte e direi che ci é pure bastata. La stanza era imbarazzante. Imbarazzante nella manutenzione non da un 4 stelle ma forse per un 2 stelle. Sanitari palesemente usurati, macchie ovunque, segni di muffa.... Le foto parlano da sole. Forse la struttura era un 4 stelle 20 anni fa ma ora avrebbe bisogno di un investimento di ammodernamento. Pagare 150 euro per questi livelli é imbarazzante. Aria condizionata gestibile solo da reception e quando ho chiesto che venisse regolata perché vi era una temperatura troppo bassa e fredda mi ha risposto: ""possiamo spegnerla"", l'unica soluzione era spegnerla ...... No word. Bagno cieco con ventola del bagno non funzionante. Telefono con segni di polvere sotto la cornetta di molte settimane. Ci siamo accorti di tutto questo solo alla sera perché ospiti di un matrimonio e dover fare entrare qualcuno in camera le 23:00 non ci sembrava il caso. Colazione nulla di  eclatante. Leggermente sopra la sufficienza. Pochi gli alimenti freschi, abbiamo dovuto chiedere più volte per l'acqua, perennemente terminata, le arance per la spremuta fresca e salumi. Poi una attesa di 15 minuti per il caffè, una macchinetta automatica presente. Alla mia risposta se fosse l'unica presente e che farmi 15 minuti di attesa per un caffè mi é stato risposto che potevo dirigermi al bar della piscina, dovendo attraversare Er intero la struttura e caricarlo sulla stanza? Se quella povera macchinetta automatica si fosse rotta? Morale? Esperienza unica nel suo genere, peccato che sia solo che negativa.",1,2022,08,07
06,Matrimonio da favola ,"Oggi ancora travolti dalle emozioni, non possiamo non  dedicare un minuto alla struttura che ci ha accompagnato nel nostro giorno speciale:Tenuta Moreno.

06,"Ideal, um Apulien kennenzulernen","Wir haben sechs Nächte in dem Hotel verbracht, um mit einem Mietwagen Apulien zu erkunden. Allerdings ist das Anwesen so gross und schön, dass wir dann doch mehr Zeit als gedacht im Hotel verbracht haben und auch häufiger als gedacht dort zu Abend gegessen haben. Ein besonderer Dank gilt Maurizio von der Bar, der uns jeden Abend mit guter Laune, guten Drinks und vielen Informationen versorgte. Ein besonderes Highlight ist die Terrasse vom Zimmer, die in einen begrünten Innenhof führt, ein Innenhof mit nur einem versteckten Zugang, der praktisch nie von Menschen besucht wird. Da die Terrasse mit einem Fliegengitter abgesperrt ist, ergibt sich Privatsphäre pur im Freien und auch noch frei von Insekten. Auch der weitläufige Poolbereich und die Bar dort sind zu loben. Abgesehen von Kommunionen, Geburtstagen und Hochzeiten finden auf dem Hotelgelände offensichtlich auch sehr viele Weinproben und Lehrgänge statt, es war somit nicht nur für uns der ideale Ort, um die besten Rotweine der Welt zu erkunden. Da das Gelände sehr weitläufig ist, können sich Hotelgäste und Feiernde sehr gut aus dem Weg gehen, das gilt übrigens auch für die wirklich sehr vielen Parkplätze. Leider sind viele der wohl früher mal wunderschönen und grösstenteils wohl uralten Ölbäume auf dem Gelände nicht von der örtlichen Seuche mit dem Xylella Fastidiosa Bakterium verschont geblieben. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist als optimierbar zu bezeichnen, nur eine Kaffeemaschine in einem italienischen Hotel ist dann doch überraschend, Kochplatten und Personal für eine frisch zubereitete Eierspeise sind komplett vorhanden, die Möglichkeit wird aber aus nicht ersichtlichen Gründen nicht zur Verfügung gestellt. An der Rezeption kann man übrigens auf Nachfrage die eine grosse Bettdecke gegen zwei Einzelbettdecken tauschen lassen.",5,2022,06,05

In tanto spazio si trovano due grandi piscine.

Personale gentile e disponibile. 
Posto pet friendly per cui anche il nostro cane si è trovato a suo agio in mezzo a tanta natura. La nostra stanza era molto grande con letto king size e terrazzino molto grande.
Solo gli arredi (un po anni 90) avrebbero forse bisogno di una ""rinfrescata"".

06,Matrimonio da favola,"Io e mio marito siamo andati a visitare la struttura a febbraio del 2020, già all'epoca, nonostante il clima invernale e i lavori in corso, la tenuta ci ha convinti a tal punto da sceglierla come location per il nostro matrimonio. Nonostante le difficoltà causate dal covid, tra cui il rinvio del matrimonio, è andato tutto brillantemente. Durante la degustazione per la scelta del menù, abbiamo scelto le diverse portate, che il giorno del matrimonio ci hanno convinti ancora di più! Personale cordiale, gentile, disponibile (Settimio in particolare). Struttura da favola, i diversi ambienti ( gazebo, sala mediterranea e piscina) uno più bello dell'altro. Cibo di ottima qualità ed ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo..gli ospiti sono rimasti entusiasti. Tutto impeccabile e non da meno il giorno dopo, con percorso benessere e pranzo, gentilmente offerto dalla struttura. Se il nostro giorno è stato meraviglioso e indimenticabile lo dobbiamo al direttore e a tutto lo staff..Ci ritorneremo sicuramente, assolutamente consigliato!!",5,2021,09,03
06,"Da evitare in qualsiasi circostanza. Si vestono eleganti, ma sotto la veste c è orrore.","Purtroppo mal consigliati da amici, ci imbattiamo in questa struttura, che veste eleganza, ma una volta svestita mostra solo orrore. Prenoto una suite, ci danno una stanza di 20 mq appena, con vasca idromassaggio che fa male solo sedendoti, in quanto i fori non avvitati bene tendono a graffiare. Andiamo in piscina, e ci imbattiamo nella maleducazione totale. Danno i posti in piscina a seconda di quanto paghi e soggiorni. Quindi noi dovevamo stare dietro secondo loro insieme alle formiche e sotto il sole con un neonato perché davanti c erano stranieri che si fanno un mese. Ma per favore! Dopo una litigata che ancora i turisti ci guardano.. riusciamo ad ottenere un posto migliore. La sera se hai un bambino e per miracolo sei riuscito a farlo addormentare, devi trovare un percorso tortuoso e diverso dal ingresso principale, stando attento anche  a non essere bagnati dal loro sistema di irrigazione che innaffia sia le piante che la gente che passa, perché ogni sera c è un matrimonio o una festa con parte condivise dagli ospiti che invece si vogliono rilassare.. ristorante e servizio bar da suicidio. Un amaro del capo.. 6 euro. Praticamente gli abbiamo pagato metà bottiglia. Menù al ristorante peggio di una trattoria, con rispetto parlando per la trattoria, con prezzi da cracco. Orecchiette al sugo 10€… n* 2 petto pollo alla contadina 15€… un trancio di salmone piccolissimo 16€… Ringraziando il cielo il mio Salento non è solo questo. Bordo piscina in simpatica compagnia con bambini che camminavano scalzi. Conclusione.. questo è un covo dove spillare soldi ai turisti, ignari e ovviamente con un diverso tenore di vita, dove per loro spendere 5.000€ in una settimana, e non avere servizi adeguati, è normale.",1,2021,08,30
06,Matrimonio 14/08/2021,"Location da favola, tutto perfetto e curato nei dettagli! Il cibo ottimo e lo staff eccellente. Bellissimo il taglio torta in piscina. Siamo pienamente soddisfatti e ritorneremo presto. Sempre massima disponibilità da parte del Direttore, di Daniela e dello staff.",5,2021,08,29
06,Bella ma non balla,"Che la location sia bellissima non c’è dubbio. È il resto che lascia a desiderare. Una struttura del genere e a quel prezzo, DEVE mettere a disposizione un facchino. Anche perché tra il parcheggio e la struttura c’è un bel po’ di strada da fare. Vabbè, ci organizziamo e portiamo noi i bagagli. Saliamo in camera (grande) ma poco accogliente. Il bagno, senza finestra, è piuttosto datato. La finestra della camera si trova tra 2 muri e, a malapena, si riesce a scorgere il giardino. Passiamo alla colazione. Essa viene servita in un giardino molto gradevole. Ma la scelta non è da 4 stelle. Qualche cornetto, pasticciotti leccesi rigorosamente surgelati (è come se vado a Napoli e mi danno il babà surgelato) fette biscottate e un paio di torte. Se voglio il salato devo chiederlo. Frittata, prosciutto e formaggio. Niente di più. La ciliegina sulla torta il personale. A parte una ragazza molto simpatica ma che è dedita soprattutto al bar della piscina (che effettivamente è stupenda) il resto del personale sembra snobbarti. Pare che siano lì a farti un favore. Secondo me il posto merita ma, con qualche accortezza in più, sarebbe molto molto meglio. Quindi per me è un NO.",3,2021,08,25
06,Spettacolare,"Abbiamo usufruito della struttura in occasione di un matrimonio di amici, pranzando al ristorante e poi pernottando in hotel.
Location spettacolare, curatissima sia all'interno che all'esterno.
Ristorante ottimo, con servizio attentissimo alle esigenze di tutti gli ospiti, anche quelli con intolleranze o diete particolari.
Hotel con camere ampie, nello stile semplice e storico della tipica masseria pugliese, ma dotate di tutti i comfort.
Colazione sia con prodotti locali sia con varianti più continentali. Forse mancavano solo gli affettati, per chi ama la colazione salata. Da provare i pasticciotti caldi!
Parcheggio gratuito in loco.",5,2021,08,21

tutto perfetto con  un ricevimento  da favola. 
Location stupenda, all'esterno tanto verde, una  piscina incantevole dove c'è stato il taglio torta; all'interno una grande  sala che ci ha ospitati tutti quanti rispettando le distanze anti covid e rimanendo anche un grande spazio per poter ballare e divertirci, 
Qualità del cibo eccelsa e di primo livello, dagli antipasti alla torta nuziale.
Che dire sicuramente da ritornare 
",5,2021,08,05
06,Poca professionalità e attenzione per il cliente.,"Sono stato in questa struttura per una sola notte. Premetto che la prenotazione è stata a cura del mio datore di lavoro e che avevo chiamato per sapere fino a che ora fosse aperto il ristorante della struttura. Alla risposta, mi hanno detto che, comunque, avrebbero potuto prepararmi un piatto freddo. Sono arrivato intorno alle 23:30, dopo una lunga riunione ed il ristorante era chiuso. Ho chiesto se fosse possibile darmi un piatto freddo e, in modo sgarbato, mi è stato detto che non era possibile, perché avrei dovuto dirlo prima e perché ora non c’era nessuno in cucina. Sono rimasto molto colpito dalla reazione dello staff di una struttura a 4 stelle che, invece di mettersi a disposizione (ad esempio proporre delle fette biscottate della colazione, del pancarrè con la nutella, insomma qualcosa, qualunque cosa), ha preferito addossare la responsabilità sul cliente. Poca professionalità e poca attenzione. Ma vabbè, passo avanti, mi dico che troverò qualcosa nel frigo bar: impossibile che nella terra dei tarallini non vi sia neanche uno snack, anche solo per far conoscere la cultura gastronomica del territorio. Con mia grandissima sorpresa, invece non solo il frigo era spento e vuoto, ma anche la bottiglia d’acqua messa a disposizione era calda e completamente impolverata.
A parte questo, nella mia stanza ho trovato un palloncino ad elio fluttuante: onestamente non me lo so spiegare, se non con una scarsa attenzione alla pulizia e di per certo non siamo ai dettagli…
Colazione abbastanza scarna, poche alternative salate e anche quelle dolci non erano di ottima fattura, comunque non da 4 stelle…
Al checkout ho fatto presente che anche il frigobar era vuoto e spento, la spiegazione è stata che è una politica della struttura… che dire: chapeau.

P.s. il Salento è una terra accogliente, ma la professionalità è un’altra cosa…",1,2021,07,12
06,Matrimonio tra gli ulivi,"Siamo stati in questa splendida masseria come ospiti di un matrimonio. Molto bella la location, ottimo cibo ricca di ampie ed eleganti sale, ottimo cibo, in particolare il buffet degli antipasti. Ad attirare l'attenzione sono i numerosi ulivi secolari. ",5,2021,07,10

Vi ringraziamo davvero di cuore per aver reso il nostro matrimonio indimenticabile. Consigliamo questo meraviglioso ristorante per qualsiasi vostro evento.",5,2020,09,28
06,Servizio scarso. Potrebbero fare di più!,"Premetto che la recensione è lunga e che grazie al servizio del Maitre Davide e Gaetano abbiamo dato 3 punti, altrimenti sarebbero stati meno.
Abbiamo soggiornato a Tenuta Moreno 10 giorni ad agosto con la nostra bimba di 2 anni.

Lati positivi:
- Pulizia camere ottima (quella delle parti comuni un po’ meno), cucina buona a volte molto buona.
- Ottima la formula mezza pensione e la possibilità di decidere se usufruire del pranzo o della cena, avvisando per tempo.
- Il lunedì c’è la serata con degustazione sushi (è necessario prenotarsi prima e c’è un supplemento mi sembra di 20€ per chi ha mezza pensione o pensione completa); noi non l’abbiamo provata.
- Quasi tutti bravi e disponibili i camerieri. Davide e Gaetano sono stati davvero super. La Signora Pina sempre disponibile.
- Parcheggio interno gratuito;
- Wi-Fi gratuito 
- Buono il centro benessere, abbiamo provato due volte i massaggi e ci siamo trovati bene.
- Piscina molto bella, si trovano sempre lettini disponibili e ben distanziati tra loro;
- Sono stati molto gentili e disponibili nella gestione di una spedizione che dove arrivare per noi presso la struttura.
- Ci hanno chiamato il giorno del check out per ricordarci che avevamo dimenticato in camera il nostro cuscino personale.  

Lati negativi:
Mancanza di comunicazione e di informazione al cliente. 
Ad esempio: Il 14 agosto sera, in tenuta, c’era una megacena in occasione della vigilia di ferragosto. Quando il giorno prima abbiamo avvisato in reception che il 14 avremmo usufruito della  mezza pensione a pranzo anziché a cena, nessuno ci ha detto niente. Nessuno ci ha informato che era prevista una cena speciale di ferragosto il 14 sera in struttura. Ce ne siamo accorti al nostro rientro in hotel poco prima della mezzanotte. Vedendo gran festa abbiamo chiesto informazioni e solo in quel momento siamo stati informati. Il bello è che la struttura era al corrente che quel giorno avevamo deciso di fermarci per il pranzo e non per la cena. Credo che queste sono informazioni fondamentali da fornire al cliente! Inoltre quella sera il bar era aperto, ma non c’era nessuno a servire (perché tutti erano impegnati a preparare il gran buffet di dolci di mezzanotte); così sono dovuta andare io a cercare un cameriere al ristorante.
Un altro disservizio: un giorno decidiamo di pranzare in piscina e chiediamo al bagnino, che in quel momento era dietro il bancone,se c’è gentilmente un seggiolone e lui ci risponde che non ci sono seggioloni. Prontamente Gaetano ha risolto trovandoci il seggiolone. Sicuramente il bagnino non sapeva nulla e non doveva trovarsi dietro il bancone del bar in quel momento, ma non si può rispondere così ad un cliente, piuttosto chiedi di attendere l’arrivo del cameriere;
- Tavoli sulla terrazza della piscina sempre sporchi;
- Palestra 24/24: piccolina, ben fornita, ma attrezzi molto vecchi che cigolano. Caldo infernale nella saletta senza aria condizionata.
- Spa: bene i massaggi, ma l’atmosfera ni. Consiglierei di non lasciare sempre attiva la stazione Radio Montecarlo perché quando partono le pubblicità, crolla tutto il relax del massaggio! Anche la luminosità della stanza dovrebbe essere un po’ abbassata. Mi spiace non essere riuscita a segnalare queste due cose.

Durante il soggiorno abbiamo chiesto di parlare con il direttore. Dalla reception ci hanno detto di aver segnalato la nostra richiesta, ma del direttore nessuna traccia.

Nel complesso la struttura è davvero bella con alto potenziale, potrebbe essere una location 5 stelle se prestassero più attenzione ai dettagli. 
Mi piacerebbe ritornare un domani con la speranza che vengano migliorati alcuni difetti.

Ci siamo sentiti coccolati dal primo momento in cui siamo arrivati fino al taglio della torta nella bellissima piscina. Il cibo era squisito, abbondante, nessuno si è lamentato di nulla, la location è una favola, e come se non bastasse il giorno dopo un'altra giornata di divertimento tra piscina e centro benessere.
Che dire, consiglierei a tutte le coppie della Puglia di sposarsi qui perchè praticamente è come fare bingo a colpo sicuro. 
Ci torneremo sicuramente, speriamo molto presto!!!",5,2020,09,05
06,Tutto QUASI perfetto ,"Partendo dalla location veramente da sogno, di una pulizia eccezionale e di un gusto superlativo nell'arredamento, continuando con una colazione curata nei dettagli e con un personale della reception di una cortesia unica. Purtroppo non do i 5 pallini per una gestione scarsa della piscina e del relativo bar il giorno di ferragosto (il 14 invece tutto più che perfetto), responsabile del bar maleducato (forse in tilt per l'eccessiva mole di lavoro in un giorno festivo, abbinata a un numero scarso di personale ma questa cosa non deve incidere sulla qualità della vacanza del cliente che si reca qui per rilassarsi e non per avere discussioni e ulteriori motivi di stress). Fortunatamente il direttore della struttura, molto competente, si è scusato per il disservizio in maniera egregia. Torneremo, sicuri che le critiche vengano recepite come costruttive, e alla prossima so già che i 5 pallini ci saranno tutti",4,2020,08,17
06,Stupenda,"Ci sono stato con un allegro gruppo di amici. Una location enorme e molto bella, ben curata, nonostante la riapertura non programmata post covid. Personale cortese e competente, forse scarso nella zona piscina. Ottimo cibo, sapori pugliesi rivisitati ma che non ti lasciano dimenticare la loro bontà. Sono arrivato il giorno del mio compleanno e a fine cena, mi hanno sorpreso con una bellissima e squisitissima torta, insomma che dire, consigliatissimo, ci torneremo sicuramente. ",5,2020,08,14

06,Capodanno 2020,"Trovare le parole è facile, ce ne sono molte che potrei dire, ma quest’anno festeggiare l’arrivo dell’anno nuovo alla Tenuta Moreno a Mesagne (Puglia) è stato semplicemente fantastico. Location bellissima e suggestiva, personale gentile e cibo molto curato. Tutto questo grazie alla Famiglia Argentieri che da anni governa questa struttura ",5,2020,01,09
06,Capodanno,"Trascorso un veglione da favola. Eleganza, raffinatezza, qualità, tutto di più. Complimenti alla struttura e allo Staff. Tutto perfetto ed in tali eventi non è affatto scontato. Da riprovare in altra occasione.",5,2020,01,03
06,Due giorni di relax immersi negli ulivi pugliesi ,"Abbiamo trascorso 2 giorni a cavallo di capodanno, in questa struttura dall’aspetto austero  ricavata da una antica masseria del 1700 ma molto funzionale ben curata e dal personale molto gentile ed accogliente . I locali  comuni , comprese le camere , sono tutti molto spaziosi , curati anche nei particolari . Un centro benessere di recentissima costruzione molto pulito e confortevole con personale qualificato .  Servizio all’altezza della categoria . Cenone del 31 di ottima fattura e con pietanze estremamente gradevole al palato . La cena del giorno 1/01 della mezza pensione l’abbiamo trovata leggermente al di sotto delle aspettative  quanto a possibilità di scelta ed della qualità del luogo ,ma comunque i piatti scelti erano di buona qualità . Colazione molto ricca e ricercata nella preparazione  dei piatti . É sicuramente un luogo da consigliare a coppie che vogliono trascorrere qualche giorno in assoluta tranquillità .",4,2020,01,02
06,Stavolta un pò deluso,"Premessa: questa struttura ho avuto modo di frequentarla in più occasioni nel passato, e nulla da eccepire al riguardo rilasciando ottimi feedback, anche su passaparola. Torno all'oggi. Ho acquistato un pacchetto per il cenone di capodanno comprensivo di spa pernotto ecc. La stanza assegnataci emanava dal bagno cattivo di odore dalle condutture. Avvertita l'addetta alla reception ci assicurava che sarebbe intervenuto qualcuno. Dopo il cenone tornati nella stanza nulla era stato fatto. Son dovuto tornare alla reception ove c'era l'addetto notturno che verificata la problematica ci faceva cambiare stanza. Purtroppo questo nel cuore della notte e spostando borse ed altro che avevamo con noi. In più come insonorizzazione la stanza precedente era migliore. Al checkout come compensazione del disagio lamentato abbiamo ottenuto solo un piccolo sconto a mio parere sproporzionato dato il costo del pacchetto sostenuto.",3,2020,01,02
06,Da tornare,"Ero già stato qualche anno fa, sempre per lavoro, posto bello, ben tenuto, con personale educatissimo e disponibilissimo, poi quest anno abbiamo scoperto che accettano anche i cani, da tornare per qualche giorno di vacanza ",4,2019,12,25
06,Ottima struttura,Struttura rinnovata e molto imponente. Camere molto grandi e abbastanza curate nell’arredo.Ristorante di qualità ma con prezzi leggermente sopra la media. Il posto è incantevole come l’aranceto dove è possibile fare colazione. Alta la possibilità di trovarlo affollato in quanto è una struttura molto gettonata per matrimoni ed eventi . Rimane nelle entroterra pugliese. ,4,2019,12,12
06,Mesagne da visitare,"Gran bella cittadina di oltre 30.000
abitanti,ma passeggiare nel centro storico è una favola in qualsiasi periodo dell'anno,si vedono negozi dappertutto ristoranti,pub,bar,locali notturni,tabaccherie aperti fino a notte fonda,puoi fare ricariche su carte prepagate sia di notte che di giorno,disponibilità e accoglienza di notevole impressione eventi e serate sia nelle piazze della città che nei locali sopraindicati, parchi per bambini, non manca niente,consiglio di andare a visitare,ne vale la pena per non parlare di B&B che ce ne sono a bizzeffe e a costi ragionevoli,non manca niente centri commerciali e chi più ne ha più ne metta,neanche nella mia città ci si diverte come la BELLA MESAGNE.
Consiglio e suggerisco di nuovo di andarla a VISITARE.

06,Matrimonio magico,"Affidarsi alla wedding planner non è semplice,significa affidare un sogno – forse il più grande e bello della vita – nelle mani di un’altra persona che fino a quel momento non conosci minimamente. 
Significa confidarle i propri desideri affinché lei li tramuti in realtà.
Oggi possiamo dire che noi non avremmo potuto desiderare di meglio… Sempre presente ma discreta durante tutto il lavoro svolto con lodevole professionalità. Ogni minimo dettaglio durante la cerimonia ed il ricevimento era perfetto come noi desideravamo. Siete stati tutti meravigliosi, non solo Daniela, ma anche Rosa, Valentina che è dolcissima, Francesco, Angelo, tutti insomma,ci scusiamo se abbiamo dimenticato qualcuno.

06,Un sitio espectacular.,"Hotel situado en un campo lleno de olivos y en una enorme extensión de terreno. Ofrecen muchos servicios, y la piscina es muy grande. Nuestra habitación tenía terraza interior con una mosquitera que en verano se agradece. Baño correcto aunque nos tuvimos que duchar dos veces con agua fría, ya que seguramente en hora punta la caldera de agua no da más de si. Lo dijimos en recepción pero no dieron solución.
Desayuno muy completo y bueno. Cena opcional muy romántica pero el menú por carta es bastante limitado, caro y bastante cutrillo. Mejor elegir la opción de buffet por 15 euros.",3,2019,08,19
06,Eccezionale,"Siamo rimasti dal 4 agosto al 17 agosto. Il luogo è bellissimo, il servizio ineccepibile, la cucina eccellente. Il servizio dei mentre è dei camerieri all'altezza dei migliori resort. La location in particolare è suggestiva. Perfetto!!",5,2019,08,18

06,Molto fumo,"Invitati a pranzo per una cerimonia privata, siamo arrivati ben predisposti avendo avuto precedenti positive esperienze dirette. Invece ci siamo dovuti ricredere.  Un'approssimazione totale nel servizio e una bassa qualità del servito oltre ad un'arida e fredda location hanno influenzato negativamente sul giudizio finale complessivo. Speriamo migliori su tutti i fronti visto che la struttura merita altro. In bocca al lupo.",3,2019,07,25

Servizio un po’ lento.

06,Fantastico matrimonio,"Sono stata in questa tenuta in occasione del matrimonio di mia cugina il 14/06/2019, che dire sono rimasta a bocca aperta ....spettacolare location, pulita, cibo ottimo e abbondante e bellissimo anche lo svolgimento del matrimonio.....abbiamo cambiato più volte location per aperitivo, antipasto, pranzo/cena e dolce, perciò niente di monotono anzi molto piacevole e di volta in volta da rimanere senza parole ....consigliatissimo!!",5,2019,06,20

06,Matrimonio,"La location è spettacolare, immersa nella natura, maestosi giardini dove far giocare a bimbi. Pil cibo è un intreccio tra i sapori della puglia e i sapori moderni. L'esterno è ben curato anche le piscine, l'unica cosa che non mi è piaciuta e il laghetto fuori la sala mediterranea,un po sporco. Del resto tutto confortevole.",5,2019,06,06

06,Da rivedere!!!,"Ci siamo fermati per pranzo con mio marito, il posto molto bello e personale gentile questo sicuramente ma...purtroppo non posso dare una recensione positiva. Il maître ci ha consigliato(o meglio non ci ha dato molte altre alternative) un antipasto di mare e di terra. Io ho specificato di essere in attesa e, dunque, tutta la parte di pesce crudo ed il resto(quindi come salumi) per me no. Ebbene come ""crudo"" è stato portato a mio marito una fettina di salmone e una di tonno marinati,  dopo di che insalatona cocktail, un assaggino di polipo, baccalà e di tonno (questi ultimi buoni ma nella norma). Come  Terra frittini di pane, tre fettine di formaggi e di salumi ( tagliati evidentemente dal colore entrambi da qualche giorno). Dopodiché non volendo altro, il maîtresse dice che ci riserva lui una ""sorpresa"" finale: un dolcino(molto buono devo dire)Accompagnato da due fettine  di ananas e fragole. Da bere 3 calici di vino. Ecco la vera sorpresa è stato il conto 89 euro!! Un po' sorpresi abbiamo chiesto spiegazioni: 30 euro ciascuno antipasto, poiché vi era crudo!! Ora a parte che chiunque sa che crudite di pesce non può essere certo una fettina di tonno e salmone affumicato, quantomeno il mio antipasto che non prevedeva crudo e salumi doveva essere ridotto!! Mah a mio avviso significa approfittare di turisti di passaggio!!!",2,2019,04,25

06,Meravigliosa tenuta immersa nel verde,"Ambiente confortevole e accogliente, immerso nel verde, tuttavia molto raffinato e curato nei minimi particolari.
Il personale è cordiale, professionale e sempre disponibile.
La colazione presenta prodotti di qualità ben preparati. Ottima la premuta di arance fresche che ci si può preparare al momento. 
Posizione strategica a metà strada tra Ostuni e Lecce. A pochi km da tutte le bellezze della Puglia.
Consigliato",5,2019,03,01
06,Un bellissimo posto ,"Abbiamo alloggiato per una notte in questa splendida tenuta.
La stanza era accogliente , pulita e moderna con un piccolo balcone che affacciava sul giardino interno . 
Il personale gentilissimo , in particolare il ragazzo della sala colazioni attento, disponibile e pieno di iniziative . 
La torta alle mele squisita 
Ottimo cappuccino di soia e caffè.

06,Bella struttura,La tenuta è nella campagna di Mesagne. Edificio ampio ed arioso con piscina all 'aperto e centro spa. Stanze spaziose e ben tenute. Letti comodi. Buono il ristorante con prodotti locali. prezzi ragionevoli. ,4,2018,09,14
06,Buono x cerimonie ,Sono stato in questo ristorante in occasione del matrimonio di un mio amico. Il personale si è dimostrato professionale e determinato a rendere il giorno delle nozze perfetto (con successo). Qualità del pranzo ottima e posto molto bello. Assegno 4 stelle e non 5 solo perché non avendo avuto modo di vedere le stanze non ho tutte le info necessarie. Non ho alcun problema tuttavia a consigliarlo per chi voglia organizzare un pranzo/cena in occasione di una cerimonia. ,4,2018,08,25
06,Alti e bassi ,"Una struttura tra alti e bassi. Location molto bella soprattutto all’esterno ma le camere lasciano a desiderare soprattutto perché datate nel realizzo, secondo me andrebbero ammodernate. Esterno molto bello, cucina, cibo e servizio ottimo. Personale qualificato se non in alcune figure che parlano solamente inglese (!!!). Pessima la Wi-Fi, praticamente un servizio non servizio. La tv non è fruibile autonomamente poiché i telecomandi non la rendono tale visto la difficoltà nella connessione con i decoder nel retro della stessa. Non esiste connessione satellitare (tipo Sky) ed è incomprensibile per un 4 stelle. Credo che una bella “rinfrescata” generale sia doverosa per poter mantenere alte le 4 stelle. Personale della Spa altamente antipatico e spocchioso. Consiglio la struttura ma con i dovuti limiti che ho enunciato. DA MIGLIORARE MA CON POTENZIALITÀ ENORMI. Gr®",2,2018,08,15
06,Molto bello,"Location veramente carina e rilassante. Circondato da splendidi ulivi, in effetti non c'è altro attorno, è sicuramente un luogo adatto per dedicarsi al relax. Bello il parco e soprattutto la grande piscina. La camera era enorme, l'aria condizionata funziona benissimo, meno bene la connessione Internet e anche il loro wifi. Le finestre isolano perfettamente dall'esterno, ma tra le stanze invece si sentono rumori. Colazione piuttosto varia con un utile estrattore di succhi ",4,2018,08,02

06,Sempre un piacere tornarci ,"Ormai d'abitudine, dopo la vacanza salentina, passo l'ultima giornata in questo paradiso.
Il prezzo non è certo economico, ma il servizio, gli spazi, il cibo , il personale , la struttura giustificano tutto.
Camere ampie e comode, pulite e semplicemente arredate, bagni, e soprattutto docce, spaziose e comode. Letti King size comodissimi  
 Piscina grande e pulitissima  (ottimi i panini del pool bar!)
La Spa inclusa nel soggiorno è essenziale ma sufficiente per passare del tempo in totale relax
Colazione superlativa con prodotti freschi e soprattutto tipici del territorio : oltre ai dolci freschi potrete tovare frutta direttente colta dagli orti della tenuta, frise, pomodori, conserve , spremute d'arancia fatte al momento è centrifughe  ( per me segno di un servizio di gran qualità )

Consigliato vivamente",5,2017,12,11
06,Un sogno tra gli ulivi,"Sono tornato in questo hotel dopo due anni e non posso che confermare il mio giudizio positivo. La struttura molto grande è veramente curata in ogni dettaglio. Anche se è dedicata essenzialmente a eventi come matrimoni, anniversari e meeting aziendali anche il turista si trova a suo agio. Le camere sono ampie con un arredamento essenziale ma piacevole. Grande il bagno con grande doccia  e set di cortesia che comprenda anche delle belle pantofole (non quelle usa e getta comuni negli alberghi). Il letto è comodissimo con materasso di grande qualità e manutenzione e pulizia sono impeccabili. Apprezzabile per i fumatori il loggiato annesso alla camera protetto da zanzariera (molto utile essendo Tenuta Moreno immersa nella campagna). Unico appunto al menù del ristorante presentato in buste di plastica, però la qualità dei piatti è notevole. Il tutto a un prezzo inimmaginabile in nord Italia. Tornerò.",4,2017,12,11

Primo di pesce senza sapore e pasta riscaldata tutta attaccata, secondo primo poco cotto. Secondo di pesce passabile.dolci no comment. Potrebbe fare di più ma va rivisto un po' lo staff",2,2017,10,11
06,Recensione del solo RISTORANTE !!,"Location gradevole, servizio premuroso ed attento. menù a la carte modesto, poca scelta. Antipasto di tris di crudo affumicato: spada, salmone e tonno gradevole e non da grande distribuzione, poco condito, ma migliorato dall'olio portato al tavolo. Primi: una pasta con alici, bottarga e pomodorini originale e gustosa, più banale i cavatelli con le vongole, comunque un frutto di mare di buona qualità. Poi scaloppina alla brace che invece era piastrata ed un pò acquosa , peccato per il taglio di carne comunque valido. dessert con mignon vari al carrello, tutti di frigo e qualità modesta. Ottimo rosato al bicchiere. Rapporto qualità / prezzo onesto per la materia prima, meno considerando che la cucina si dovrebbe impegnare di più.",3,2017,10,08

06,Qualità e professionalità ,"Sono stata ospite presso questa struttura sita in territorio di Mesagne per impegni di lavoro. La struttura molto curata, è articolata in diverse sale ed ambienti molto spaziosi, utili per ricevimenti e congressi.
Il cibo di buona qualità, il servizio professionale, i locali molto puliti, insieme ad un'ampia area parcheggio, un giardino mediterraneo, un centro SPA, fanno di questo luogo un posto rilassante consigliato sia per ricevimenti sia per incontri di lavoro.

06,Matrimonio da favola,"Invitati al matrimonio di MariaCristina e Pasquale ho avuto l opportunità di visitare questa tenuta 
Location fantastica, il ricevimento di svolgeva di sera
Siamo passati dall'aperitivo/antipasto sotto il portico principale per poi passare attraverso un viale alberato illuminato da lanterne e microlanterne appese ai rami in un giardino di splendidi ulivi per sederci sotto a tendoni a tavoli eleganti per la cena, poi a bordo di una delle diverse piscine per il taglio della torta per finire in una ennesima struttura a bordo di un laghetto seduti ad altri bianchi tavoli per i dolci ed gli auguri di fine festa.
Tutto fantastico , nulla da eccepire ma forse due note stonate...
La prima che forse sarebbe meglio lasciare le bottiglie di vino sul tavolo piuttosto che aspettare di dover intercedere con il cameriere e la seconda forse sotto un certo aspetto più fastidiosa il dover attraversare giardino, viale, giardino ed albergo per poter usufruire delle toilette.
Considerando che il giardino dove si è tenuta parte della cena era prospiciente ad una enorme piscina attrezzata e quindi senza dubbio fornita di tali servizi basterebbe poco estendere tali per i ricevimenti 
Anyway tutto fantastico!!!
Personale attento, cordiale e simpatico ",4,2017,09,02

06,Vacanze nel Salento ,"Siamo stati in questo hotel due settimane in agosto e ci siamo trovati 
benissimo. l'hotel è un po' isolato per cui occorre assolutamente avere 
un'auto per poter andare verso il mare che dista 25/30 km ma anche per 
visitare le zone turistiche del salento o anche Matera. Avevamo una 
camera al piano terra con un terrazzino con due sedie e due divanetti 
fatti in muratura completato da una bella zanzariera che non guasta mai. 
La camera non è enorme ma arredata con gusto e sempre molto pulita. 
Eravamo in regime di mezza pensione per cui la colazione, varia e 
abbondante, veniva servita sulla veranda che dava sull'aranceto mentre 
la cena in un altro terrazza con vista sulle piante di ulivo. Credo che 
questa comunque sia la versione estiva con la brutta stagione, credo, 
che sia tutto organizzato in modo diverso. A colazione viene servita la 
spremuta di arance fresca , una rarità al giorno d'oggi e devo dire che 
non è roba da poco.  Per la cena invece c'è sempre un buffet di 
antipasti e uno di dolci e frutta, mentre il primo e il secondo sono a 
sceltra tra una rosa di 4/5 proposte sia di pesce che di carne. Il 
giovedi sera c'è la serata salentina con tutti piatti tipici a buffet e 
carne alla griglia, la domenica sera invece c'è un menu servito a tavola 
dall'inizio alla fine senza buffet. Abbiamo avutola fortuna di passare 
il ferragosto qui ed hanno organizzato un buffet bellisimo e maestoso 
all'aperto, con anche pizze cotte nel forno a legna, panzerotti fritti 
al momento etc etc il tutto senza extra e compreso nella quota della 
mezza pensione.  La piscina e grande e mai troppo affollata anche in 
agosto, si puo scegliere di stare sulle sdraio con teli forniti 
dall'hotel oppure sulle sedie e tavolini disposte qua e la sotto gli 
ulivi. Dietro la piscina c'è l'orto con tante piante di verdure ed erbe 
aromatiche e anche tante piante di fichi. i fichi vengono raccolti e 
messi a disposizione in un enorme fruttiera nella hall a disposizione di 
tutti i clienti. Abbiamo usato la SPA al  primo piano solo una volta per 
sauna bagno turco e idromassaggio  ma non per i massaggi e ci è sembrata 
ben disposta. La linea dei cellulari è un po' ballerina ma non dipende 
dall'hotel ma dai ripetitori dei gestori telefonici. Il WIFI è buono e 
gratuito. ci siamo trovati bene e tutti sono stati gentili e disponibili 
con noi ci sentiamo assolutamente di consigliarlo

",5,2017,08,24
06,Posto indimenticabile,"Per il secondo anno consecutivo ho trascorso parte delle mie vacanze estive in questa bellissima masseria in provincia di Brindisi.
Accoglienza eccellente, professionalità, cordialità. Un posto unico nel suo genere ideale per trascorrere del tempo all'insegna del relax. 
Bellissima la piscina pulita e curata, dove tutt'intorno sono ordinatamente disposti dei comodi lettini dove riposarsi dopo il bagno. 
Le camere sono assolutamente in linea con la categoria di appartenenza dell'hotel, le 4 stelle dunque o forse un pelino di più. Bellissima la doccia con la cromo terapia. Nelle stanze disposte al piano terra c'è un piccolo terrazzino con tavolo e sedie, utile soprattutto se si è con bimbi piccoli e magari è necessario mettere qualcosa fuori ad asciugare.
Per gli amanti del benessere, c'è a disposizione degli ospiti un centro benessere con vasca idromassaggio, sauna, bagno turco. 
E ovviamente la cucina, ben fatta e realizzata per lo più con materie prime locali prodotte proprio nella masseria come  - nel pieno della stagione estiva -  zucchine, pomodori, insalata, frutta. Lo chef propone una cucina di mare e di terra con grande competenza senza mai strafare. Imperdibile, se capita durante il soggiorno, la serata con cena salentina. Un tripudio di sapori salentini come le buonissime bombette sulla, le orecchiette con le cime di rapa oppure pomodoro e cacio ricotta. E ancora fave e cicoria, lampascioni, pasticciotti, paste di mandorle e tanto altro ancora.
Un posto da scegliere quando si vuole staccare com lo stress di tutti i giorni e dedicarsi del tempo di qualità.

06,Aspettative deluse!!!,"Siamo stati per la prima volta in questo decantato hotel in occasione di un matrimonio e purtoppo siamo rimasti molto delusi dalle aspettative....tutto dall'inizio alla fine ha lasciato molto a desiderare.Il personale, forse perché trattandosi di stagisti senza alcuna esperianza, nn avevano un minimo di professionalità perciò il servizio è stato pessimo...il cibo poi senza infamia e senza lode e il buffet di frutta e dolci alla fine una vera delusione... a fine serata abbiamo chiesto dell'acqua fresca e l'addetto alla somministrazione di bevande ci ha risposto che era finita!!!ma come si può in una struttura così avere tutte queste mancanze? Peccato perché la location è bellissima e penso che migliorandone la gestione potrebbe essere di alti livelli.",2,2017,08,20
06,Una location fantastica,"Ho soggiornato alla Tenuta Moreno per due notti. Il posto è bellissimo, con una piscina davvero fantastica che offre molte opportunità per rilassarsi. Sotto un ulivo o più vicino agli altri altri ospiti, seguendo le suggestioni del momento.Comodo il servizio bar a bordo piscina. Molto confortevoli anche le camere. Il valore aggiunto di questo luogo è offerto dalla colazione, servita in una terrazza bellissima. Ideale per un viaggio romantico.",5,2017,08,15

06,Wir haben leider keine 4 Sterne gefunden,"Die ganze Hotelanlage ist vorwiegend auf Hochzeiten und auf Kongresse ausgelegt.
Der ""Badegast"" ist hier eher 2. Rangig Dies spürt der ""normale"" Hotelgast auch. Die Hochzeitsgäste sind in Anzug und Krawatte und schauen den Badegast in Badehosen ziemlich schräg und teilweise Arrogant an.
Man fühlt sich hier nicht wohl und deplaziert.
Mehr als 50% der Hotelanlage ist den Hochzeiten vorbehalten, die schönen Bilder der Anlage sind Abschnitte die den Hochzeiten vorbehalten sind. 
Dieses Hotel kann somit auch nicht wie im Katalog als ruhig bezeichnet werden da es täglich (auch Wochentags) mindestens 1 bis 3 Hochzeiten pro Tag und auf einmal hatte! Feuerwerk mit lautem Geknalle jeweils Abends beim Abendessen (20.45 Uhr) ca. 60 Meter vom Restaurant entfernt inklusive!
Wir hatten eine Juniorsuite, die Klimaanlage liess sich aber weder ausschalten noch richtig regeln (Temp. Anzeige unlesbar) . Die Dusche (Wellness) war grösstenteils defekt und hatte keine Beschreibung zur Bedienung.
Sehr schwaches Zimmer für eine Junior Suite, auch keine kleine Begrüssung wie ein bisschen frisches Obst oder so...kennen wir von der Türkei ganz anders und da hatten wir keine Junior Suite!
Die Liegen beim Pool sind komplett durchgelegen, der Stoff (Kunststoff) liegt direkt auf dem Metallgestänge des Stuhles und ist deshalb sehr unbequem und als Zumutung an zu schauen. Auch die Poolanlage ist zu 50% den Hochzeiten vorbehalten!
Meine Frau hatte eine lebende Raupe in ihrem Salat gefunden was ihr natürlich gehörig den Appetit verdorben hat. Sie hat dies dem Chefkellner diskret gezeigt, worauf dieser mit einem komischen Lächeln den Teller einfach nur weg trug. Somit war es für ihn erledigt! Keine Entschuldigung oder dergleichen, weder an diesem Abend noch sonst wann. Dies geht nun mal echt nicht in einem Hotel dass mit 4 Sternen wirbt!
Am Abreisetag checkten wir aus, worauf wir nur ein Grazie für die bezahlte Rechnung erhielten. Keine gute Reise Wünsche, oder schön waren sie hier oder hat es ihnen gefallen....kein Interesse.
Das Personal der Rezeption konnte nicht Deutsch und war grösstenteils sehr reserviert (unfreundlich) oder künstlich nett. Personal im Restaurant war soweit freundlich
Morgenbuffet ist sehr schlicht, aber der Orangensaft der frisch gepresst wird kann man als positiven Höhepunkt werten.
Schön fanden wir dass wir jeden Abend ""unseren"" Tisch hatten und nicht einen freien suchen mussten. 
Das Abendessen war soweit gut , aber so bald etwas aus dem Buffet leer war , wurde es nicht mehr aufgefüllt.....kennen wir so nicht
Dieses Hotel können wir mit diesen Erlebnissen auf keinen Fall weiter empfehlen, auch wenn die Sauberkeit wirklich gut ist!
Unser Fazit ist : Für Hochzeiten oder Kongresse ist dieses Hotel zu empfehlen, aber für alle anderen Aufenthaltsgründe (Baden,Erlebnissferien,etc.) ist es nicht empfehlenswert.",2,2017,07,11
06,Matrimonio,"Spettacolare. Una location da sogno. Dall' aperitivo al dolce ... Un luogo diverso. Cibo ottimo. Organizzazione 10 e lode. Gli antipasti da capogiro. Crudi di pesce.

06,"Großes Hotel, toller Pool, gutes Frühstück, Dinner soso","Wir waren 2014 schon einmal eine Woche hier und waren so begeistert, dass wir heuer wieder eine Woche hier verbrachte, ieder in einer schönen Junior-Suite im EG mit heckenumstandener Terrasse. 
Der riesige Pool mit Poolbar war wiederum wenig besucht und herrlich - die Liegen sind allerdings (wohl auch bauartbedingt) durchgelegen und müssten ersetzt werden. Der Bestand an großen Palmen auf dem Poolgelände ist leider dezimiert, weil ein Schädling zuschlug.
Mirella, die in Deutschland aufgewachsene Gästebetreuerin des Hotels ist zu TUI gewechselt, so gibt es keine von ihr veranstalteten Nudelkochsessions, Weinproben pp. mehr.
Das Gelände des Hotels ist riesig und mit Oliven, Orangen, Kräuter, Tomaten und allem möglichen bewachsen.
Die Produkte werden in der Küche verwendet.
Das Frühstück ist für italienische Verhältnisse gut (frischer O-Saft, viel Kuchen, gutes Brot, einfache Auswahl an Wurst und Käse, Früchte, Müsli usw.). Das fertige Rührei ist allerdings §schnittfest"". Aber man bekommt auf Verlangen Spiegeleier/Omeletts individuell zubereitet. Und statt Kannenkaffee auch Cappuccino/Latte/Espresso.
 
Das Abendessen besteht in der Regel aus Vorspeisenbüffet, Pasta-Gang mit 5 Auswahlmöglichkeiten, Fleisch-/Fischgang mit 4 Auswahlmöglichkeiten resp. gegrilltes Gemüse als veganer Gang. Und Dessertbuffet.
Da offenbar der Koch gewechselt hat, ist diese frühere Highlight keines mehr: die Nudelgänge variieren nicht sehr und Fleisch/Fisch schmecken nicht besonders. Auch ist der Materialeinsatz nicht mehr so toll wie früher - man spart offenbar.
2 mal wöchentlich gibt es regionales Essen: einmal schnurren die Auswahlmöglichkeiten auf null zusammen, weil die Gänge vorbestimmt sind (inhaltlich aber nicht anders) und einmal gibt es ein Barbecue mit u.a. zähen Lammkoteletts.
Wenn Hochzeiten, Tagungen pp. sind, spürt man die dünner gewordene Personaldeck deutlich.
Für ca. 70 Gäste gab es z.B. eine kleine Schüssel Tiramisu ohne nachzuliefern.

Das Hotel ist sehr großzügig angelegt. Die Poollandschaft und der Garten ist sehr schön.
Das Frühstück war okay. Die Rühreier sahen allerdings nicht sehr appetitlich aus,
dafür waren die Kuchen klasse und der Automat für den frisch gepressten Orangensaft
etwas besonderes.
Das Abendessen für unsere Gruppe hätte etwas besser sein können (teilweise sehr lieblos und nicht sehr italienisch)

Zum Wohlbefinden der Gäste tragen außerdem bei: zwei Swimmingpools, ein paar Tennisplätze, ein kleiner Fußballplatz und ein schöner Wellnessbereich. Das Frühstück war für italienische Verhältnisse recht üppig, hatte aber bei Schinken und Käse leichte Schwächen. Das Abendessen schmeckte ganz hervorragend, war in der Qualität aber leider ein klein wenig abhängig davon, ob gleichzeitig eine große Hochzeit, ein Geburtstag oder eine Tagung stattfand. Dafür konnte man sein Frühstück auf einer herrlichen Terrasse und das Abendessen in einem Weinkeller einnehmen.

06,Capodanno PESSIMO,"Struttura con un ottimo potenziale, grazie alla bellezza degli ulivi che circondano la struttura, ma gestita MALISSIMO con personale PESSIMO: Esperienza da dimenticare!
Avevamo scelto di trascorrere due notti per festeggiare il capodanno in questa struttura, e dopo aver speso 600 euro per sole 2 notti in mezza pensione (bevande escluse), abbiamo riscontrato non pochi problemi. 
Camera maleodorante con una forte puzza di fogna, phon rotto (mancava il tasto per le velocità), telefono rotto e non sostituito, riscaldamento rumoroso. Per la risoluzione di quest'ultimo problema ho richiesto lo spegnimento del condizionatore e l'accensione del termosifone che era sito nel bagno della camera. Tuttavia, nonostante l'addetta alla reception mi abbia detto che non c'erano problemi, al nostro rientro in serata nulla era stato risolto.
A causa del telefono rotto, dunque, ogni qualvolta volevamo spegnere il condizionatore per poter riposare (cosa proibitiva quando era acceso) eravamo costretti a raggiungere la hall perché i riscaldamenti sono centralizzati. 

Inutili le mie lamentele alle quali non sono seguiti provvedimenti per riparare alle mancanze e ai disagi provocati dalla cattiva gestione della struttura. 

Per non farsi mancare nulla, abbiamo quasi assistito ad una rissa la notte di capodanno che ha visto protagonista uno dei proprietari della struttura.
Infine, vi consiglio di tenere la piscina pulita e non con acqua marrone e piccioni morti dentro.
Vi auguro di chiudere al più presto.",1,2017,01,03

L'arredamento è molto curato e in linea con lo stile della zona; le ceramiche di Grottaglie la fanno da padrone, nella hall come nelle stanze. Struttura molto grande , ma non dispersiva. Ci si può imbattere in angolini relax (all'interno come all'esterno) arredati con gusto e molto accoglienti. Ho letto qualche lamentela in merito alla colazione, ma a me, personalmente, pare ingiustificata. Torte, cornetti, muffin, confetture casalinghe, pane, formaggi e un prosciutto crudo ottimo. Ma la menzion d'onore per la colazione la darei alla macchina che contiene arance fresche e che, nel giro di un minuto e davanti ai vostri occhi, taglia e preme le arance producendo un succo freschissimo.

06,Due notti per un lavoro in zona.,"La struttura è molto bella ed ampia. Purtroppo il periodo dell'anno non era quello giusto: pioggia e freddo.
Gli interni sono molto confortevoli, le stanze molto ampie anch'esse. Quella che mi ospitava , al piano terra, aveva anche un terrazzino coperto con divanetti e tavolino .
Tutto ciò mi ha creato aspettative non del tutto soddisfatte. La colazione è di medio livello, le uova strapazzate non erano gran ché e la macchinetta per tostare il pane non era in funzione. Il personale d'altronde è molto cortese e gentile.
La cena è stata come la colazione, media. Non c'era molta scelta sia di primi , sia di secondi.
Ho usufruito anche della zona ""benessere"", almeno in parte perché di sera era aperta ed agibile solo la saletta con qualche attrezzo per esercizi fisici.

La strada ,prima di arrivare alla tenuta ,non è proprio ideale, la presenza di un grosso bus che non permetteva di entrare mi hanno innervosito, poi superato il primo momento sono riuscito a guardarmi attorno con attenzione e devo dire , nonostante il periodo il parco era bellissimo, con piante ,zone verdi stagni è una piscina enorme oltre ulivi secolari. Particolare la struttura disegnata bene con tanti spazi ben organizzati. Veloce l'accoglienza ed enorme la stanza assegnataci. Serata di gruppo con cena a tratti gustosa e comunque con ampia offerta di pietanze. Buona la colazione con offerta di dolci ma quasi nulla di salato. Personale ridotto e poco esperto. Pranzo , per me migliore della cena, più caldo e con specialità del posto. Ho dubbi che ci sia una cucina funzionante e che i pasti siano forniti dall'esterno.
Nel complesso gradevole ma da rivedere in piena estate con la struttura funzionante al massimo. Buoni i prezzi fuori stagione.",4,2016,11,02
06,"Molto bella , servizi da migliorare leggermente ","Una dimora magnifica , immersa nel verde e con spazi all'aperto magnifici . Ottimo prezzi , il servizio ottimo ma non adeguato alla bellezza della struttura . Si può fare di più ... ristorante discreto ma senza particolari note di eccellenza . ",4,2016,11,01
06,Viaggio di lavoro,Che dire tutto perfetto . Colazione ottima camere grandi belle e pulite. Personale sempre disponibile e gentile. Piscina ben attrezzata e centro benessere molto bello. Ottima anche la cena. Dopo la cena si può sostare nel bar a bordo di una piccola piscina per gustare un buon caffè,5,2016,11,01
06,day spa.... per fortuna era un regalo....,"premetto che tutto il personale... dalla reception, alla spa, ai camerieri sono stati più che gentili. detto ciò la cosa bella è la camera di servizio, una comodità estrema per chi ha il pacchetto con cena. tutto molto curato e pulito. la spa nulla di eccezionale ma tenuta bene e pulità... non ho usufruito dei massaggi e quindi non posso giudicare... l'unico neo per cui non mi fa dare più stelle è stata la cena... avendo cenato altre volte in varie occasioni ed avendo mangiato sempre molto bene, sono rimasta molto delusa dal menù della serata. non so se era per via del pacchetto... ma speravo in qualcosa di meglio... peccato!!!",3,2016,10,27
06,Matrimonio,"Siamo stati alla tenuta Moreno per un matrimonio e siamo rimasti tutti colpiti sia dalla location sia dal cibo..ottimi.
Personale preparato e gentile, salette molto carine, cibo divino e abbondante.
Evviva gli sposi",5,2016,10,21
06,Cena da favola,"Organizzata da amici cena in questa struttura di aspetto incantevole con personale gentile e competente  in una saletta privata. La cena a  base di pesce molto sfiziosa, ben presentata e veramente gustosa dove eccellevano tartara di tonno rosso e nasellini freschi fritti. Ti senti coccolato, per questo ho chiesto di vedere tutto l'ambiente per poterci tornare quanto prima ",5,2016,10,19
06,Una bella realtà ormai consolidata,"Un luogo dove avere una ristorazione alta e sale immerse nel verde dove organizzare meeting e riunioni anche di pochi, una gestione eccellente che da alla struttura sula SS7 per Taranto facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto di Brindisi una plus non indifferente. Da scegliere anche per soggiorni particolari considerate tutte le dotazioni della struttura ",5,2016,10,18
06,Ottima struttura,Struttura davvero molto bella. Vi ho trascorso una sola notte ma ho apprezzato la qualità della stanza e del bagno. Anche il terrazzino è molto carino. Buona la colazione. Una cosa da segnalare: i prodotti del frigo bar molto cari. Es. Bottiglia d'acqua a 3€! Per il resto è ok. La prossima volta assaggio la cucina.,4,2016,10,13
06,Ottima come sala ricevimenti ,"Bellissima struttura situata nelle campagne tra Latiano e Mesagne ; nasce dalla ristrutturazione di una antica masseria e presenta vari ambienti tutti arredati con stile ed eleganza, tenendo sempre in considerazione la tradizione pugliese.
Molto ampi e curati gli spazi verdi,  anche se non guasterebbe un po' di illuminazione in più nelle ore serali e la presenza di personale nelle aree di parcheggio e nei percorsi verso le sale. 
In tutta franchezza la ritengo tra le migliori in zona e tutte le volte in cui ci sono stato (lo frequento da anni, da ultimo in estate) mi sono sempre trovato bene. 
Ottima sotto l'aspetto della ristorazione e del servizio (sebbene abbia riscontrato un lieve peggioramento rispetto ai primi anni di apertura).  Ideale per festeggiare cerimonie di ogni tipo. 
Dispone anche di una buona spa e di camere hotel a 4 stelle. 
Da provare. ",4,2016,10,08
06,Soggiorno per lavoro ,"Ottima struttura, rilassante e curata nei dettagli. Dispone di un bellissimo giardino con alberi di ulivo secolari. L'unico problema è rappresentato dalla difficoltà di avere un collegamento Wi-Fi continuo...",4,2016,10,04
06,Urlaub Apulien,"Das Hotel ist wirklich gut, tolle Anlage! Das Zimmer, Junior Suite, war auch gut! Schade fanden wir, das ab 9 Uhr beim Frühstück keine Wurst und kein Käse mehr da war, auf Nachfragen wurde dann jedoch nachgelegt! Der Shuttle Service war über die komplette Woche defekt, geht gar nicht!!!!!! Insgesamt ok!",4,2016,09,24
06,Matrimonio ,"Cerimonia in giardino e resto del ricevimento in 4 location, bella la piscina per il buffet dei dolci, ottimi antipasti (mozzarelle preparate al momento, frittura di mare fresco, vari tipi di affettati tagliati al momento), ottimo cibo, da rivedere i vini.. Ottima la possibilità di pernottamento ",5,2016,09,18
06,Il matrimonio dell'anno!,"Ho festeggiato il mio matrimoni qui e siamo rimasti due giorni in più!!
Cucina impeccabile e pesonale molto cordiale, in particolar modo Marta e Perla che con la loro gentilezza e disponibilitá hanno reso il soggiorno in hotel eccezionale!!",5,2016,09,14
06,Ottimo cibo,"Siamo stati ospiti durante un ricevimento matrimoniale, serviti molto gentilmente ed il cibo era ottimo. Abbiamo degustato numerose pietanze a base di pesce accompagnate da verdure fresche. Il vino bianco era molto buono",4,2016,09,14
06,BELLA LA STRUTTURA.......,"Abbiamo soggiornato nel periodo di ferragosto con i nostri bambini (6 e 9 anni)
Struttura che non ha servizi particolari per i bambini.
La grande piscina però è un diversivo non indifferente per loro.
Le camere sono molto belle (j suite), curate e assolutamente pulite
Abbiamo usufruito del servizio BB
La colazione deludente sia per l'offerta che er il servizio. Poca scelta. Personale non all'altezza e/o non in numero sufficiente. Spero che sistemino la cosa perchè la struttura merita molto.",3,2016,09,13
06,Matrimonio ,"Ci sono stata per un matrimonio e la nuova location (interna ed esterna) mi è piaciuta molto rispetto ad alcuni anni fa.
Buon cibo e buon servizio.
Durante il buffet di frutta e dolci nel serale però non c'era illuminazione e si faticava a capire cosa si stava mangiando e anche il personale aveva problemi nel servire.",4,2016,09,07
06,Giovani belli e...pugliesi,"Credo fortemente nei team giovani e qui alla Tenuta si distinguono per gentilezza e attenzione. Leggo molto attentamente le recensioni degli hotel anche se non scrivo quasi mai...anzi mai, ma loro sono davvero bravi e meritano due parole da parte nostra. Camere belle, spaziose e confortevoli. Pulizia e ristorante 10+ 
Le tre ragazze in reception sono disponibili, gentili e carine a qualsiasi ora...in tarda serata lì pronte ad ascoltare le nostre avventure da ""turisti per caso"" in posti meravigliosi come Lecce, Polignano, Monopoli..e il mattino seguente nuovamente pronte a darci il buongiorno con il sorriso. Viva la Puglia e le persone come voi che la rendono meravigliosa a noi turisti. Speriamo di tornare presto!",5,2016,09,07
06,Struttura bella personale da formare,"La struttura meriterebbe, la piscina è bella, bello il contesto verde e perfino gli orti, ma l'attenzione al cliente non è a livello di un 4 stelle. 
La colazione disastrosa.... assolutamente non accettabile la pulizia dei tavoli all'aperto (presenza di escrementi di uccelli sui tavoli apparecchiati) gli alimenti sia come presentazione che come feschezza lasciano parecchio a desiderare (diversa frutta marcia o annerita, le arance marce messe nello spremiagrumi dagli inservienti senza fare attenzione, pane sparpagliato, brioches anche, salumi e formaggi zampettati) inservienti occupati a fare di tutto tranne a curare la sala e la clientela. Impossibile recarsi presso le piscine dopo le 19.00. Il bagnino già alle 18.30 dava segni di insofferenza, ma se si arriva alle 18.00  forse una mezz'ora di piscina si desiderebbe farla giacchè è uno dei motivi portanti che ci ha spinto a scegliere l'hotel! 
Caduta di stile con la bottiglia di acqua in camera in bella vista con bigliettino che recita una frase di benvenuto per poi terminare con un bel € 3, in un hotel dove si pagano ben 200 € a notte si potrebbe anche non farla pagare, ma almeno se la fate pagare non scrivete che è per il mio refrigerio! Medesima caduta di stile della receptionist che interrogata se in hotel si possa girare in accappatoio vista la presenza della spa, prima risponde che in costume non si gira nella hall (non ci saremmo mai permessi siamo abituati a hotel ben più prestigiosi!) poi chiede se posseggo un copricostume... E' pur vero che rispetto gli standard della zona è meglio di altri, ma da un 4 stelle che si pregia di essere un hotel di lusso e come tale si presenta, pretendo di più.",2,2016,09,05
06,Posto strepitoso!,"Siamo stati qui per un workshop all'interno di una sala convegni.
Posto stupendo, curato nei minimi dettagli.
Alla reception le ragazze erano preparatissime e il brunch offerto è stato strepitoso. Davvero da 5 stellw",5,2016,08,23
06,Bella struttura ,"Ho trascorso qualche giorno con la mia famiglia e devo dire che il posto è bellissimo immerso in questi ulivi secolari una pace e tranquillità che cercavo. Tutto impeccabile dal servizio al cibo forse l'unica cosa che non mi ha spinto a non dare il massimo del voto sono alcune camere in particolare quella che mi è stata assegnata, a mio parere  che andrebbero quanto meno arredate e curate meglio visto il prezzo di ognuna di loro.",4,2016,08,19
06,Week end meraviglioso,"Struttura immersa nel verde,circondata da uliveti secolari.Abbiamo trascorso due giorni in pieno relax.Rinfrescati in una piscina meravigliosa, colazione in giardino con il cinguettio degli uccelli,personale gentile e disponibile.Una struttura eccellente complimenti!!!",5,2016,08,18
06,bel posto,"Un posto bellissimo, uno dei miei preferiti, ci sono stata per l'ennesima volta alcuni giorni fa per un matrimonio. Un po scontenta per l'organizzazione anche se mi è sembrato un po strano, nel complesso non male però!!!",4,2016,08,04
06,Delusione,"Siamo stati invitati in questa struttura in occasione di un matrimonio e tutto ci saremmo aspettati quanto ad eleganza,ricercatezza del cibo,ambienti ben serviti e personale sapiente. Niente di tutto ciò, iniziando da un antipasto a buffet a dir poco lontano dal tradizionale e molto vicino allo scarso,per finire alle portate del menù descritte come se dovessero essere tre piatti e in realtà è uno!! Insomma col matrimonio alla "" pugliese "" ha ben poco. Spero di ricredermi al prossimo evento.",1,2016,08,02
06,Che delusione,"Mi sono recato in questa decantata location per un matrimonio e le pecche si sono dimostrate notevoli. La struttura non è organizzata per garantire un accesso in sicurezza ai disabili in ogni sua zona, camerieri poco professionali (non tocca a me cliente spostare i piatti centrali dal tavolo per creare spazio), il responsabile di sala non indossava la giacca al momento del nostro arrivo in sala antopasti ed ha composto il piatto di un commensale a mani nude. ",2,2016,07,10
06,Alles bestens ,"Der Service, das Frühstück und die Gastfreundschaft sind wirklich hervorragend. Besonders hervorzuheben ist Mirella, die perfekt Deutsch und Italienisch spricht. Sie macht ihrem Job mit viel Liebe und Leidenschaft. Auch sollte man unbedingt ihren kostenlosen Pasta-Kurs besuchen um endlich mal zu sehen, wie man Nudeln mit der Hand macht.

Wir hatten nur Frühstück gebucht, um die Restaurants in den Nachbarorten kennen zu lernen und haben damit alles richtig gemacht, da wir echte Juwelen entdeckt haben.

Einmal haben wir im Tuneta zu Abend gegessen, doch das Abendessen hat uns nicht ganz überzeugen können. Das hat den 5. Stern gekostet.

Wer eine ruhiges Hotel mit tollem Ambiente sucht mit einem wirklich guten Service und einem ganz tollen weitläufigen Pool, der ist hier genau richtig.

Das Frühstück ist wirklich top, frisch gepresster Orangesaft und Kuchen erfreuen das Herz. Das selbst gemachte Weißbrot ist wirklich top und gehört zu den besten die wir hier im Umkreis gegessen haben. Leider ist das Obst meistens nie reif gewesen (außer die Kiwis), insofern ein kleiner Wermutstropfen.",4,2016,07,01
06,tenuta polifunzionale,"Approfittando della partecipazione dei nostri figli ad una manifestazione sportiva in zona, io e mia moglie, ci siamo concessi un w.e. di benessere e relax in questa stupenda struttura. Personale alla reception, molto discreto e gentilissimo, nel ""farci saltare"" la coda di un gruppo straniero appena arrivato al check-in, dandoci la cortese possibilità di accedere con puntualità al centro benessere per usufruire del percorso già prenotato. Il centro benessere, piccolo, ma completo dei vari ambienti e servizi (peccato che la vasca idromasaggio non funzionasse al 100%), si avvale dell' eccellente professionalità dello staff (veramente superbo il massaggio total body relax). Ristorante ricavato in un angolo dell' adiacente agrumeto. Maitre e camerieri molto gentili e discreti, forse da migliorare alcune pietanze presentate (il filetto non era specificato sul menu era praticamente una cotoletta). Camere molto spaziosa, ma nonostante l'aria condizionata spenta, molto rumorosa. Struttura nel complesso enorme, praticamente un labirinto, ma nolto funzionale. Da ritornarci sicuramente.",4,2016,06,18
06,Semplicitá ed eleganza,"Siamo tornati per il nostro primo anniversario...tutto bellissimo e sempre molto curato.
Pulizia come sempre impeccabile,colazione con abbondante varietà di gustosi croissant e  coccolati dall elegante ed accogliente aranceto, pranzo ottimo e per finire la deliziosa torta gentilmente offerta dal personale della struttura.
Grazie ancora una volta al personale di tenuta moreno ...al Direttore Argentieri sempre cordiale e professionale, a Daniela per la sua sempre viglie supervisione , al personale di reception e di beauty e wellness.
É sempre un piacere essere accolti dall' eleganza di questo posto! Non mancano mai cordialita e simpatia!

06,Lusso in campagna,"Nella campagna brindisina, struttura moderna, ben curata con piscina grande e piccola. Camere confortevoli, bagno bellissimo, letti comodi.

06,Matrimonio 30/05/2015,"Location fantastica come allo stesso tempo la qualità dei cibi ben serviti e del serviZio impeccabile (la media di un cameriere ogni 2 tavoli).
È stato un giorno fantastico reso bello da tutta l organizzazione del tenuta moreno che ha curato ogni minimo particolare dall inizio alla fine della cerimonia, coccolandoci anche il giorno dopo con un percorso benessere ed un pranzo Come se non bastasse ottimo e di alta qualità!
Le stelle sull' insegna sono**** ma secondo me   vale come un *****.",5,2016,05,29
06,Buon cibo e posto gradevole,"Giudizio limitato alla sola ristorazione. Buona la presentazione dei piatti, buone le materie prime. Ottimo l'antipasto. Si vuole porre come un ristorante di livello ma bisognerebbe migliorare il servizio. Non è certamente un 5 stelle ma tuttavia si sta abbastanza bene. Molto bella la location, in particolare la parte antica. Basterebbe poco per renderlo un locale di classe e per una clientela più esclusiva.",4,2016,05,28
06,EIn Traum am Lande,"....in der Mitte eines großen Parkes mit Oliven, Palmen, mehreren Pools, ausgezeichnetem Essen (obwohl wir mit Reisegruppe unterwegs waren). Schöne große Zimmer. Wohl auch ideal für Familien.
Da am Lande gelegen etwas zu weit um noch auf ein Gläschen in die Stadt zu fahren ....
sehr große Terrasse vor dem Zimmer",5,2016,05,23
06,Nicht ganz das was wir von anderen Viverdi Hotels kennen,"Das Hotel ist sehr schön gebaut, Zimmer toll, Vögel im Innenhof anfangs störend bis man sich an ihr gezwitscher gewöhnt.
Anlage an sich sehr schön und die von anderen störend empfundenen Hochzeiten, haben wir nicht wirklich war genommen. SPA Bereich komplett, sauber und gut gepflegt.
Im Mai ist keine Saison daher alles schön ruhig und leider auch die möglichkeiten ausserhalb der doch sehr kurzen Öffnungszeiten von Restaurant und Bar im Hotel zu essen und trinken. Passt irgendwie garnicht zu den gewohnheiten Reisender. Qualität ist sehr gut (daher auch relativ teuerer) und ja es ist nicht für die Urlauber die am Buffet immer mehr mitnehmen wollen als sie essen können. Mehr Fokus auf Qualität anstelle Masse. Auf jedenfall muss man hier mobil sein, da die Anlage in den schönen Olivenfeldern liegt und es ausser der Anlage nichts gibt. Angestellten sind freundlich &hilfsbereit.
Also in Summe schönes Hotel für die die ausserhalb der Saison mal auspannen wollen ohne das übliche Programm. ",4,2016,05,21
06,Semplicemente fantastica Tenuta,"Che dire Un angolo di paradiso immerso nel verde,Location fantastica, camera bella e grande, servizi impeccabili. colazione DOC , ristorante superlativo. Insomma se vi trovate in zona vale la pena soggiornare in questa fantastica tenuta dove sarete sicuramente affascinati da tutto ciò che vi circonda a partire dalla cortesia del     personale .
Penso che in zona non ci sia struttura più bella.

06,Sehr schönes Landhotel,"Sehr geschmackvolles Landhotel. Schöne große Poolanlage. Wir waren 5 Nächte da und hatten Halbpension. Die 4 Gänge Abendmenüs waren ein Traum. Die Preise für eine Flasche Wein recht günstig. Sehr nette Bedienungen. Das Frühstücksbuffet dagegen war sehr überschaubar. Eine Sorte Wurst, eine Sorte Käse und immer die gleichen. Wenn um 8.00 ! die Brötchen aus waren, wurde nicht mehr nachgelegt. Dann gab es nur noch Baguette Scheibchen. Das dreckige Geschirr auf den Tischen wurde nicht abgetragen. Erst wenn alle weg waren. Cappuccino und Espresso kosteten extra. Schade, dass der sehr gute Eindruck vom Abendessen beim Frühstück immer wieder zerstört wurde.",4,2016,05,14
06,Location Stupenda,"Sono stato ospite in questa location grazie ad un viaggio di lavoro.
servizio  all'altezza di un albergo a 4 stelle. Struttura molto bella immersa nel verde tanti spazi ed ulivi ben curati, caratteristica della regione Puglia.
Stanze grandi, maggiore attenzione all' immagine ,tipo copriletto con macchie.
Da ritornarci sicuramente.",4,2016,05,13
06,"Stimmig, mit kleinen Abstrichen","Insgesamt empfehlenswert für den ruhesuchenden Urlauber in der Vorsaison.

- freundlicher Service, mit Mariella kann man nötigenfalls auch alles in Deutsch klären
- weitläufige und ruhige Anlage
- großer Pool mit Bar und Terasse
- Kräutergarten und eigene Hühner, die den Eierbedarf nachvollziehbar nur zum Teil decken
- SPA Bereich (allerdings Textilsauna)
- umfangreiches Frühstücksangebot, es werden auch landestypische Produkte (z.B. Ricotta forte) angeboten, die gekochten Eier hatten leider einem deutlichen Grünstich um das Eigelb herum
- auch hier wird ein sehr freundlicher Service geboten
- Abendessen war in Ordnung, der Service korrekt, beim gemischten Salat wäre es schön gewesen, wenn es etwas mehr als nur Eisbergsalat, Tomaten und etwas Rucola gewesen wäre
- die Flure zu den Zimmern sind mit Stoffbahnen abgehängt, das reduziert den Schall - gut
- die Türen knallen leider sehr, hier wäre eine Dämpfung wünschenswert
- das Zimmer hatte ein nicht entfernbares Mückengitter (ohne Löcher!) - sehr gut
- insgesamt ruhig, was vermutlich auch der Vorsaison geschuldet ist
- es gab keine Veranstaltungen, die beim Schlaf gestört haben, nur irgendwann am späten Abend essen ein nicht nachvollziehbares, aber kurzes Feuerwerk",4,2016,05,13
06,Battesimo,"Sono stata qui per un battesimo. E' stato scelto un menù a base di pesce e carne.
Sono rimasta colpita dalla freschezza del pesce crudo ottime ostriche, cozze e vongole.

Dopo sono stata malissimo...",4,2016,05,01
06,Tutto fumo ,"Tre giorni prima prenoto senza alcun problema un pacchetto day Spa (il mediterraneo per essere precisi ).  Alla data scelta ci rechiamo e senza nessuna attesa ci danno la chiave della stanza in day use. Nel tratto per arrivarci ti rendi conto di un particolare dopo il primo corridoio fatto con porte in noce carine e pareti colorate passi a corridoio e porte  bianche(praticamente dedicate al day use). Niente di grave ma ti dà l'impressione di essere di second'ordine(tranne quando paghi). Comunque il problema vero arriva quando entriamo  al centro benessere.
La struttura è decisamente fredda nell'insieme e per essere un 4 stelle molti dettagli andrebbero curati come docce che funzionano e non, percorso Kneipp decisamente ridicolo (ne dovrebbero davvero rivedere il concetto) , nel bagno turco su due rubinetti solo su uno ci trovi una gomma attaccata senza neanche una doccia e all'altra neanche la gomma. Scopro poi che lo scrab che  nel pacchetto è scritto a parte dalla voce percorso correlato dalla scritta ""20 min""(come ho riportato sotto) non è  un trattamento che fanno loro così come ti porta a credere quando leggi il pacchetto ma  ""Self Service"" così ti dicono ,una ciotolina di sale aromatizzato  che ti costa 40 euro a coppia (a saperlo ne avrei fatto a meno)!!! E poi Dulcis in fundo dopo tante Spa che ho girato sia in Puglia che anche in altre regioni è  in assoluto la prima dove il massaggio viene FATTO SOLO ALLA PARTE POSTERIORE DEL CORPO. Non vale quello che paghi ho visto 4 stelle decisamente migliori e che costano anche meno! Di seguito riporto come descritto il pacchetto in questione. DIFFIDATE!
""MEDITERRANEO DAY 
Anima Mediterranea
Idropercorso benessere rilassante che include doccia tiepida/shower gel aromatico, bagno alle erbe, doccia emozionale ""Breeze"", bagno turco, percorso Kneipp, sauna finlandese, cascata di ghiaccio, idromassaggio (120')
Scrub ritual mediterraneo: scrub di oli essenziali ad azione tonificante, rinfrescante e drenante per tutto l'organismo. (20 min.)

06,Ottimo,"Il posto è un pò isolato ma bello. dire che è ideale anche per cerimonie. Le camere belle, pulite e spaziose, ambienti comuni di livello. Buona colazione dolce e salata. Lo staff cordiale e preparato. ottimo anche il ristorante con piatti tipici della zona.",4,2016,03,31
06,Un week-end di puro relax...,"Sono stato in questo bellissimo resort per due notti, precisamente nel ponte pasquale...
Appena arrivato, sono entusiasto di avere la sensazione di essere immerso nel verde, con i nostri ulivi pugliesi, alberi di mandarini e arance, tipici della tradizione pugliese...
Anche la hall molto bella e curata ; la camera favolosa, ben oltre i 14 mq di standard minimo per una camera matrimoniale, penso fossero circa 22 mq interni, ed esternamente una bella terrazza con tendaggio e divanetti... Inoltre sempre in camera, ho davvero apprezzato la possibilità di usufruire della cromoterapia in doccia, che creava una gran bell'atmosfera soft, piacevole e davvero rilassante....
Perfetta anche la temperatura della camera, impostata su 25° ; si stava così bene, che ,  nonostante i 6° notturni, si può tranquillamente dormire senza alcuna coperta .
Il piacere del sonno è anche dato dall'altezza del materasso non indifferente, credo siano sui 25 cm .
Per quanto riguarda il mangiare, posso dire che, nonostante fossero giorni festivi ( pasqua e pasquetta ), si è mangiato davvero bene ; le portate sempre ricercate e raffinate, con l'utilizzo dei prodotti km 0 ( olio extr vergine d'oliva, latticini, pesce e carne ) ... E altro punto a favore della struttura, è che nonostante fosse un festivo, non ho trovato il chiasso tipico delle struttre, con bimbi che gridano, piangono...
Si è stati davvero divinamente...
Concludo con una menzione speciale per la spa, davvero completa di tutto, a meno del percorso classico kneipp ; sauna finlandese, bagno turco, e il meraviglioso bagno alle erbe, per cncludere con 'idromassaggio con vista ulivi .
Se proprio devo trovare l'unica e piccolissima pecca è stata la colazione : è vero che l'ho sempre fatta verso le 9.45 ( essendo in vacanza, avevo il piacere di riposare un pò ) , però al massimo ho trovato solo cornettini vuoti, poca nutella, cereali, yogurt... Non ho mai trovato colazione internazionale, ed anche diverse torte e crostate...
Consiglio vivamente di soggiornare qui, e provare anche la cucina...
Voto finale, qualità prezzo : 9/10...
Sono certo che tornerò il prima possibile, grazie a tenuta Moreno, son tornato rigenerato a lavoro.....",5,2016,03,30
06,Ogni volta un emozione,"la tenuta è immersa negli ulivi e contornata da prati, è un posto spettacolare,lo staff gentilissimo sempre a disposizione del cliente, cucina strepitosa, uno dei migliori centro benessere visitati fino ad ora si respira il vero relax .

06,Pace,"Tutto é perfetto ci sono tornato dopo dieci anni ed ora è terminata in tutto il suo splendore ho festeggiato li il mio matrimonio.

06,Sempre impeccabile,"Vengo qui spesso per lavoro, ed ogni volta è una bella conferma.

Ancora se ne parla, tant'è che una coppia di amici l'ha scelto come locale per il suo matrimonio, così con emozione siamo ritornati a luglio 2015. E con vero piacere abbiamo salutato sia il maitre che il direttore della struttura, che si ricordavano di noi. Il giorno del nostro matrimonio abbiamo poi pernottato in albergo, in una camera davvero ben arredata ed accogliente, fatto una colazione super, con possibilità di dolce e salato,passato la mattinata nel centro benessere coccolati da accappatoi morbidi e tisane calde ed infine pranzato nella caratteristica sala col soffitto a botte. Un piacere per il palato e per gli occhi. Consigliatissimo! ",5,2016,01,31

06,Fantastico!,"Siamo al top... É da un pó che volevo scrivere di questo straordinario luogo, che a me e a mia moglie ci ha fatto passare una giornata indimenticabile. Abbiamo festeggiato qui il 10 agosto 2015 il nostro matrimonio e tutto é stato perfetto: dal cibo di qualità e in abbondanza alla cortesia del personale. La stupenda location, immersa nel verde salentino, ci ha fatto trascorrere il più bel giorno della nostra vita stracoccolati, stradivertiti e strarilassati.. Che dire ancora, grazie di cuore a tutto lo staff, ed un encomio particolare va fatto a Daniela per la Sua estrema sensibilità e professionalità. Speriamo di tornarci presto..",5,2016,01,13
06,Meraviglioso,É una struttura che per location e professionalità del personale ha reso incantevole e indimenticabile il giorno più bello: il nostro matrimonio!!! Lo risceglierei senza nemmeno pensarci. Direttore e organizzatori dell'evento sono persone davvero disponibili e gentili,5,2016,01,03
06,Un capodanno in tenuta,"Un posto fantastico in inverno ... (immagino cosa sia in estate...) personale affabile e molto professionale.. unico piccolo neo: una colazione con pochi salati (c'era solo del formaggio, prosciutto cotto, frittata e uova sode...) potevano dare di più per un 4 stelle. Per il resto nulla da dire... nel prezzo era compresa la SPA con un percorso quasi completo... location più che fantastica!!!",5,2015,12,31
06,Oasi di verde e bellezza nel Salento,"Nel nord del Salento, questo hotel rappresenta a pieno lo stile locale, con camere ben arredate, ambienti comuni di grande classe e pulizia al top.

06,Eccellente ,Struttura bellissima immersa nella natura. Camera grandi belle dotate di tutti i confort. La struttura è veramente accogliente e il personale e gentile e accogliente. L'unico difetto che posso trovare e la colazione il salato ho dovuto chiederlo,5,2015,12,17

06,Bella struttura ,"Tenuta Moreno si trova  nelle campagne di Mesagne a pochi km da Brindisi.
L unica pecca sono le poche  indicazioni stradali per arrivarci.
Ho solo dormito qui senza usufruire del  ristorante perciò non potrei dare giudizi sulla ristorazione.
La camera era spaziosa, pulita, wifi gratuito, sky a pagamento ( a mio aviso un pò eccessivo mettere a pagamento tt i canali), accessori per il bagno incluse le  ciabattine.
La colazione è un po scarna, forse x la bassa stagione, ma con prodotti di qualità.
Lo consiglio come hotel.",4,2015,11,21
06,Uno splendido albergo inaspettato ,"Per una mia recente sosta nelle zone del Salento mi hanno consigliato questa tenuta
Un ottima scelta Albergo realizzato in una antica masseria dotato di tutti i confort. Personale cordiale ma altamente professionale, servizio spa e beauty farm.
Colazione ottima e abbondante 
Lo consiglio vivamente",5,2015,11,12
06,Solo delusione!!!!!,"In questa struttura ci siamo stati più volte in diverse occasioni l'ultima propio domenica x um ricevimento di circa 40 persone questa volta è stato il massimo della delusione nn rispettando ne il menù ne tenendo conto delle quantità in base alle persone.iniziando dal drink di benvenuto molto scarso, il primo pur chiedendo se fosse possibbile  un bis abbiamo ricevuto la risposta che nn c'enera piu, nn parlando della pasta e pomodoro x i bambini... alcuni bimbi hanno dovuto aspettare più di mezz'ora x avere un piatto di pasta perché loro avevano sbagliato a far uscire le quantità giuste...x i secondi lo stesso disastro. .. arriva la frittura di pesce e le cozze crude ed era un piattino da dividere in 5/6 persone... cose assurde. ..è propio personalmente mi sono lamentato x far portare altro perché era impossibile dividere... poi sul menù c'era scritto il flambe`di filetto e invece hanno dato gli straccetti di entrecot alla brace che è totalmente diverso da quello ordinato pensando forse di avere a che fare con persone stupide che nn sanno cosa è un filetto o un  entrecot ,ma comunque sia la carne che il pesce alla griglia sempre quantità molto limitate... ci siamo ritrovati furi a fare la fila e c'erano solo un po di contorni e ancora metà delle persone nn aveva preso niente, infatti gli diretti interessati hanno sollecitato x far fare altre cose perché la roba era tutta finita e ancora c'era chi nn aveva mangiato. ....nn ti potevi nemmeno alzare x andare in bagno perché al tuo ritorno nn c'era più il piatto con le tue cose x mangiare... è questo lo può fare solo personale incompetente che quel giorno era in sala.....tutti ci siamo chiesti cosa era successo conoscendo benissimo chi aveva organizzato l'evento siccome nn era la prima volta e sappiamo che nn badano a spese.... ma la risposta è solo 1 ..... di tenuta Moreno purtroppo è rimasto solo il nome.... a questo punto nn c'è più professionalità e serietà nel gestire le occasioni. .....di questo evento rimarrà solo tanta delusione!!!!!",2,2015,10,27
06,Relax ed aria pura,"Gran bella location tra le campagne di Mesagne. Ottima ospitalita' e buona cucina hanno caratterizzato il nostro soggiorno. 
Percorso benessere, gratuito per gli ospiti della struttura, molto piacevole e ben organizzato con personale cordiale e professionale. L'unica pecca sono state le mosche, che a cena e colazione erano posate finanche sui cibi del buffet.",4,2015,10,19
06,Molto valido,"Vado di tanto in tanto in questi hotel, purtroppo non comodissimo con il lavoro.
Non manca nulla: location molto suggestiva, immersa nel verde, stanze ampie dotate di una comoda loggia. Tutto pulito ed ordinato.
La colazione ha una scelta molto vasta ed al mattino presto il pane è ancora caldo.
Ho cenato solo una volta e li ha perso la quinta stella: non male , ma da un hotel così bello mi aspettavo qualcosa di meglio. Era di mercoledì con cena tipica, ma buffet un po scomodo e niente di trascendentale. ",4,2015,10,16

06,Matrimonio,Sono stato a pranzo a tenuta Moreno in occasione di un matrimonio... La location è fantastica le sale ben preparate il personale cortese educato e ben preparato è la parte migliore è sicuramente quella culinaria ottimo il crudo di mare con frutti di mare crostacei e pesce ottimo tutto dal buffet ai primi i secondi e il taglio torta spettacolare molto suggestivo in un isolotto a centro piscina un sogno....se mi dovessi sposare e li che vorrei farlo complimenti a tutti.,5,2015,09,14

06,Belle camere per una notte tranquilla,"Abbiamo dormito 1 notte a Tenuta Moreno a fine agosto. 

La stanza era al piano terra: molto spaziosa e bella, con una fantastica vista sul giardino. E' stata una notte molto tranquilla, non abbiamo sentito nessun rumore.
Perfetto per un romantico weekend fuori città.",4,2015,09,05
06,Un tranquillo anniversario ,"Io e mia moglie vi abbiamo festeggiato il nostro anniversario con una day spa Prima di ferragosto.
Per quanto riguarda la struttura sicuramente datata ma ancora affascinante per ambienti e anfratti caratteristici. La camera non  da 5 stelle,  almeno quella  data in day use era grande e pulita ma non di bell'aspetto. 
Il ristorante molto caratteristico in particolare quello all'interno della cantina ma la qualità del cibo era buona  ma la quantità lasciava molto a desiderare non sono un mangione ma non ero neanche  a dieta. 
Arriviamo alla spa dove dipendenti confidenziali e gentili non bastano ad arricchire le qualità della struttura nuova ma già in degrado nelle zone umide. 
Tutto sommato gradevole giornata ma non da ritornarci.
",3,2015,08,25
06,Esperienza positivissima!,"Sono stata qui per una vacanza all insegna del relax e non potevamo recarci in un posto più indicato! La struttura è molto accogliente il personale assai cortese e gli spazi esterni nonostante siano molto ampi sono curatissimi. La tenuta offre sia la possibilità di potersi trattenere al suo interno usufruendo di vari servizi come piscina, campi da tennis o spa oppure, grazie alla buona posizione, si possono raggiungere comodamente cittadine limitrofe come Ostuni. ",5,2015,08,23
06,Molto buono,"Buona attenzione al dettaglio e qualità. Superiore alla media di ciò che si trova in puglia, location fenomenale. Ai matrimoni c'è una buona qualità di cucina di mare (scampi, gamberetti, gamberi rossi di Gallipoli (wow), ma anche di terra, mozzarelle fatte al momento, salumi. I dolci sono di grande qualità. Loro stessi si curano della materia prima  (hanno un orto della tenuta), le carni sono di ottima qualità e cotte benissimo. Vini di buona qualità. La cucina è ricercata, ma non troppo, questo la rende adeguata per tutti i commensali nei grandi eventi. La colazione in hotel, non vi dico, qualcosa di buonissimo. Succo d'arancia veramente buono e una frutta sensazionale.",5,2015,08,23
06,tutto bellissimo,Io e il mio fidanzato abbiamo trascorso una giornata rilassante cn day spa e cena.. tutto eccellente.. dalle coccole del massaggio alla cena abbondante e ricca di novita'. Posto incantevole..ci torneremo presto :),5,2015,08,18
06,Eccellenza nel territorio,"Tenuta Moreno è una location che negli ultimi anni ho frequentato almeno una volta al mese e ha sempre retto le aspettative.
A Tenuta Moreno si mangia davvero molto bene e c'è grande disponibilità della direzione nell'organizzazione di eventi.
Non ho avuto la chance di pernottare ma non ho mai sentito nessuno lamentarsi.",5,2015,08,17
06,Tenuta Moreno: l'Eccellenza è di casa,"Tenuta Moreno non si smentisce mai..
tutto denota eccellenza, professionalità, qualità del cibo ( quasi tutto a km zero) e dei servizi, attenzione e coccole ai Clienti..
sotto l'abile regia di Pierangelo Argientieri una Squadra Fortissima si muove seguendo uno spartito unico e facendo a gara nel sorprendere in positivo il Cliente..
la pulizia delle camere e degli ambienti è maniacale,
la piscina e la Spa danno senso al Relax..
e il cibo....SUBLIME con scelte varie gustose che riprendono molto le ricette di un tempo..
il pescato poi è da Applausi per quanto è fresco..
la Colazione vale da sola una visita alla Tenuta..
Standing Ovation per tutti voi..

non tornare sarebbe una Colpa",5,2015,08,04
06,Wohlfühloase im Süden Italiens,"Ein wunderschönes Landhotel zum Erholen und Entspannen,welches keine Wünsche offen läßt!  Warmherziges,kompetentes Personal.Köstliches Essen,behagliche Ausstattung,traumhafte Außenanlagen mit sehr gepfegtem,großen Pool. Empfehlenswert sind Radtouren in die Umgebung und die Nutzung eines Mietwagens.   Zur Erholung trägt die wohltuende Freundlichkeit der Apulier bei.  Ins Tenuta Morena kommt man nach Hause,von einem Ausflug in eine Barockstadt oder vom Meer.   Tenuta Moreno ist eines meiner Hotelfavoriten!",5,2015,06,18
06,Erholsame Tage in sehr gepflegtem Ambiente,"Wir verbrachten bei schönstem Wetter zwei wunderbare Wochen in diesem Hotel. Das Zimmer war im Erdgeschoss zum Innenhof. Ein Fliegengitter bot Schutz, so dass man auch bei geöffneter Terrassentür schlafen konnte - mindestens solange bis die Spatzen zum Konzert ansetzten. Dann schoben wir halt die Türe etwas zu und schon war ruhe.
Das Hotel ist sauber und gepflegt, das Personal ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Die Tipps und Infos von Mirella (vielen Dank Mirella, auch für die Geschichten anlässlich des Weinkurses) waren super und auch der Pasta-Kochkurs war äusserst lehrreich und unterhaltsam (zuhause haben wir schon mal die leckere Tomatensauce kreiert - und hinbekommen!) 
Der Service war immer freundlich und alles war von sehr guter Qualität.
Das Hotel besteht aus mehreren Gebäuden welche allesamt - von aussen und von innen - äusserst Stilvoll sind. Anlässe wie Meetings, Hochzeiten, Konfirmationen etc. kommen fast täglich vor, sie stören jedoch überhaupt nicht da es viele ruhige Ecken, Gärten, und sonstige Rückzugsmöglichkeiten gibt - es ""verläuft"" sich alles wunderbar.",5,2015,06,15
06,tenuta moreno super,"ottimo come sempre tenuta moreno, è stato un piacevole anniverario di matrimonio , il centro benessere è stato bellissmo, ve lo consiglio veramente, la qualità del cibo come sempre fantastica, come anche l'accoglienza",5,2015,05,14
06,Spettacolare...,"È il più bell' albergo dove abbia mai soggiornato per motivi di lavoro fin'ora. Struttura sia interna che esterna molto raffinata e curata nel design, camere ampie e spaziose, suite lussuosissime, piscina accattivante, mi manca solo la spa da provare. Un paio di volte ho cenato nel ristorante ma le porzioni non erano esattamente abbondanti, anche se saporite e genuine. L'unico neo è rappresentato dalla posizione troppo isolata, bisogna fare almeno 30 minuti di macchina su strade molto buie per arrivare alla vicina Brindisi.",5,2015,05,08
06,Location bellissima,"Sono stato ospite della Tenuta Moreno per una cena di lavoro e poi per la notte.
La struttura è veramente bella ed imponente. Bellissime le piscine. Le stanze sono ampie, ben arredate, colori chiari, con verandina e pulitissime. Unico neo il servizio molto lento e poco attento.",4,2015,04,20
06,Pasqua in Tenuta,"Dopo aver passato un fine settimana pasquale con la mia famiglia, posso solo complimentarmi con il Direttore e tutto lo staff.
Partiamo dal primo punto a favore di questa favolosa tenuta: la cucina;
nonostante il giorno di festività abbiamo mangiato in modo eccellente, sia a cena che a pranzo, una cucina veramente a 5 stelle dall'antipasto al dolce, complimenti allo chef e a tutto il suo staff.
Il secondo punto a favore è la struttura.
Situata nelle tipiche campagne pugliesi tra ulivi secolari e piscine rurali. 
Il terzo punto è la SPA; quest'ultima non è grandissima, ma appena si accede nella vasca idromassaggio (anch'essa piccola) si può ammirare un panorama mozzafiato, colori brillanti che ti circondano: il verde dei prati e degli ulivi, l'azzurro del cielo e se siete fortunati l'arancione del tramonto.
Sicuramente ci tornerò in futuro, ancora complimenti a tutti.",5,2015,04,11
06,Tantissimo fumo: forse era meglio che il Moreno coltivi olive e viti,"- Reception: molto lontano dai bisogno di un cliente che non  paga poco per alloggiare e godersi un break. Intanto poco carino vedere 3 persone alle reception di  cui due discutono e scherzano, uno richiuso in ufficio e una sola che  lavora chiaramente sotto stress  in quanto gli tocca badare a più clienti che spesso si avvicinano anche solo per chieder delle informazioni visto questo luogo è nel bel mezzo della stupende campagne pugliesi e una guida è d'obbligo, no un optional. Non commento sul facchino che discute dei suoi problemi personali al banco della reception facilmente udibile dai presenti. 

- Piscina: chiamarla piscina è una offesa ad una vasca da bagno. Questa sembra più una struttura creata appositamente per rendere cerimonie indimenticabili. Non ha un sistema di filtraggio dell acqua il che è grave, il cloro viene versato manualmente nell acqua che chiaramente non serve a nulla dato che sul fondo sono chiaramente visibili alghe che con l'azzurro del fondo si vedono molto bene. 

- Stanze: bellissime e ben aerate, tutto molto bello, pulito e luccicante. TV funzionante con programmi stranieri, bagno pulito e ampio, armadio grande e spazioso con cassaforte di sicurezza;  peccato che appena cala il sole, dal balcone interno vedi solo buoi pesto: non c'è neanche una illuminazione che dia valore al bel giardino interno. Non si capisce  se la desolazione è un valore aggiunto o no.

- Percorso benessere:  Percorso benessere venduto come tale ma di fatto ha una struttura molto simile ad un reparto di una buona  palestra con saune in fila, docce varie molto carine, ma il tutto molto freddo e poco accogliente che non da la minima sensazione di essere in centro benessere, ma anzi nella mia palestra. Docce del Percorso Kneipp  non sembra affatto quello che dovrebbe essere, funzionanti a metà e sporche, quando dico sporche intendo dire muffa raccolta ai bordi e angoli, fra pavimento e muri laterali, non va assolutamente bene in un luogo in cui la gente potrebbe andare scalza. [vedi foto] Massaggio nuvola troppo costoso, dato che di fatto l'operatore non deve fare un granché e per giunta poco delicate nei massaggi e poco cortesi, come se il cliente fosse una noia. Ma questa una caratterista riscontrata un po ovunque qui [vedi reception sopra]. Se sei sfortunato e la corrente non c'è: è BENE sapere che il generatore non alimenta questa parte dell'albergo quindi siete spacciati. Quindi in caso non vi doveste godere il percorso di saune varie non vedo altra soluzione che richiedere un rimborso. 

- Ristoranti: le sale sono varie, molto ampie, strutturate bene e con temi diversi, ma anche qui un'altra sfortuna:  trovarsi una sala con tavoli chiaramente sistemanti per un evento serale o per il giorno successivo facendo così sentire i cliente nel luogo sbagliato al momento sbagliato e non in un ristorante preparato per accogliere il cliente, cioè te. Una pecca enorme in un luogo come questo il che fa pensare che il ""customer service"" training è stato del tutto cancellato sulla liste della cose da fare. Sala colazioni esterna, molto bella, ma anche qui con cameriere che urlano ad altri colleghi distanti cose inutili che potrebbero essere benissimo riferite a voce bassa appena opportuno, tipo ""mi apparecchi quel tavolo?"". Una grossolana mancanza di rispetto nei confronti di chi è li a godersi la tranquillità del luogo. 

- Cibo: ***** cinque stelle, ed è l'unica cosa che salva questo posto dal linciaggio. Non c'è mai stato nessun problema con la cena e con i camerieri, molto veloci ed efficienti. Come detto sopra, la sale merita più attenzione sulla sistemazione dei tavoli. Colazione abbondante, con spremute fresche, cappuccino preparato dal barman e non da una macchina [come spesso accade in altri alberghi] c'è di tutto e di più. Complimenti allo chef per aver  saputo trasformare elementi della cucina salentina, in opere d'arte. 

GIUDIZIO GENERALE: ""siamo alle solite"", come si usa dire: grand bell'albergo, ottima location per rilassassi MA  tutto il personale necessita urgentemente di un corso accelerato di galateo, buone maniere e sopratutto di customer service per capire il marketing dell hotel e come trattare il cliente. All'istituto professionale queste cose le insegnano, ma se arrivati sul posto di lavoro, si dimenticano, allora vuol dire che è il management che non considera queste iniziative base. Una grossa pecca che rende questo posto un gioiello solo per coloro che vengono qui solo  per il matrimonio e vari eventi. Il tutto fa pensare ad un alberghino che fa profitto  su gruppi provenienti da mezzo mondo e ai quali, un po per cultura e un po per menefreghismo, non interessa utilizzare la piena capacità dell'albergo e tutto a svantaggio di pochi clienti capitati qui grazie ad una buona pubblicità fatta di molto fumo….",2,2015,03,26
06,Ottimo Resort Pugliese ,"Realtà vissuta a 360 gradi, come Ricevimento per Matrimonio(""Riuscito"" in tutti i sensi!), Hotel, e anche Spa; è sicuramente da Considerare se siete in zona: Personale Cortese e Gentile, Cibo Abbondante e di Qualità, Struttura Molto Bella, Curata e con una Grande e Variegata area Verde (anche piscina). 
Sicuramente Merita! ",5,2015,03,19
06,Una eccellenza salentina...,"E' la seconda volta che per lavoro sosto al Moreno...peccato che ancora non ho avuto l'occasione per apprezzare il centro benessere che a vista oltre ad essere elegantissimo risulta ben organizzato.

06,Charme di campagna,"La Tenuta Moreno se non avesse i matrimoni ( a volte deleteri per il turismo individuale)sarebbe un posto dove sicuramente parecchi si recherebbero e trascorrerebbero un paio di giorno per ricaricarsi.
Peersonale efficiente, camera e suite assolutamente in ordine e pulite. Tocchi di tradizione e buona ambientazione sono i punti di forza.
Un servizio al Ristorante ottimo con personale qualificato a cui affidare anche la scelta dei vini per una carta inesistente. Ma è l unico lieve appunto che può essere mosso...

E' stata una domenica fantastica all'insegna del relax, del personale molto gentile e disponibile, della camera comoda con vista sul giardino con erba e piante molto curate e del magnifico porticato dove abbiamo gustato la cena-gala. 
Non vediamo l'ora di ritornarci...grazie alla Sig.ra Anna e a tutta la reception dell'hotel per l'accoglienza e il trattamento che ci avete riservato!

Cordiali saluti
Francesco Margherita e Daniela Morleo",5,2014,09,30
06,tolles Hotel mit einem super Preis/Leistungsverhältnis,"Sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal, tolles Frühstück auf der Terrasse unter Orangenbäumen, alles sehr gepflegt und sauber. Ein Mietwagen ist absolut empfehlenswert. Für ein italienisches 4*-Hotel überragend.",5,2014,09,26
06,Personale allucinante,Vengo qui per lavoro in media 4 volte all'anno....il posto incantevole....ma nel servizio c'è  tanto da migliorare. Il personale per niente all'altezza del servizio che presumono  di offrire....poca cortesia....scontrosi e per niente corretti. Ho rinunciato a dormire qui perché  spesso ho trovato l'acqua fredda in doccia e mi è  capitato una volta di aver dimenticato degli indumenti nell'armadio che mi hanno restituito per metà.,2,2014,09,22
06,uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert ��,"wunderschönes hotel in einer ehemaligen masseria mit toller pool- und gartenanlage. die zimmer sind gross, gut eingerichtet mit viel ablagefläche. es gibt eine nette terrasse, geschützt mit einem fliegengitter. das personal ist sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und stets gut gelaunt. das essen ist absolut fantastisch und wird jeweils auf der terrasse (frühstück und abendessen) gereicht. das vorspeisenbuffet möchte ich speziell loben - ich hätte mich in den 2 wochen nur schon damit satt essen können. zu erwähnen ist, dass das hotel im grünen liegt. ein auto sollte man haben - auch schon um das wunderschöne apulien anzuschauen!",5,2014,09,20
06,Un paradiso di coccole e relax,"Sono stata in questo meraviglioso luogo ad aprile in occasione della Pasqua. Sono stata benissimo, posto incantevole e servizio eccellente in ogni cosa. Nei mesi successivi ho provato a tornarci, ma è talmente richiesto che era spesso al completo. Non intendo rinunciarci! Torneró presto. Lo consiglio di cuore a tutti coloro che come me amano solo il meglio!! Le camere sono molto curate e pulite. Il cibo è squisito e la Spa è un sogno, soprattutto per i magnifici massaggi. Il personale è educato e disponibile ad ogni esigenza del cliente. Meriterebbe 5 stelle!!",5,2014,09,08
06,MOLTO BUONO,"Vacanza in famiglia
Tutto perfetto.....
Eccellente la cucina e la disponibilità/gentilezza del personale.
Camere comode e pulitissime
Una struttura consigliatissima dotata di ampi spazi verdi tutti curati in modo maniacale....

Piccolissima pecca (che non mi fa mettere il punteggio pieno) la pulizia del fondo della piscina nonché dell'acqua....(angoli con presenza di funghi d'alga) ",4,2014,08,25
06,Gepflegtes Top-Hotel,"Ehemaliges Weingut, sehr gepflegt und sauber mit sehr freundlichem Personal. Eine tolle Anlage, klasse Frühstücksbuffet draußen auf der Terrasse, Mega-Pool. Wunderschön aber etwas abseits in Olivenhainen gelegen zwischen Mesagne und Latiano. Sehr empfehlenswert! Mietwagen ist allerdings sehr zu empfehlen, wenn man nicht nur in Hotel und Pool verweilen will, was aber für eine Woche Entspannung auch kein Nachteil wäre.",5,2014,08,24
06,Garanzia Assoluta,"Di recente abbiamo organizzato una cena per circa una ventina di persone, in occasione del nostro 25° anniversario di matrimonio, come già accennato nel titolo della recensione ""Garanzia Assoluta"" sin dal primo istante in cui abbiamo messo piede nella Tenuta. Ogni cosa perfetta e di grandissima qualità. Tengo a sottolineare la gentilezza, cortesia e professionalità di tutto il personale impegnato nella Tenuta ad iniziare dal Direttore. Sicuramente da consigliare (come già ho fatto) per qualsiasi tipo di cerimonia o anche per una semplice cena in un luogo molto bello e ben curato.",5,2014,08,22
06,Ogni cosa al suo posto,Vado spesso a trascorrere delle ricorrenze in questo posto con amici e parenti e conosco molto bene la struttura. Non posso recriminare nulla per i servizi che offre e soprattutto la buona cucina anche se cercherei di ampliare un po il menu offrendo qualcosa di particolare vista l'importanza della struttura. I prezzi sono un po più alti rispetto alla media ma il tutto è giustificato da una serie di dettagli e dal posto in cui ci si trova. Il personale è molto attento e gentile verso la clientela anche se c'è qualcuno che si distingue in maniera negativa rispetto alla maggioranza. Lo consiglio a chi voglia passare una giornata lontano da tutti in tranquillità. ,4,2014,08,22
06,Service und Essen topp !,"Das gesamte Personal war immer sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und reagierte mit einem Lächeln, wenn wir sie in italienisch begrüßten. Besonderer Service des Hotels ist die Gästebetreuerin ""Mirella"" , ein wahrer Glücksfall, die immer ein offenes Ohr für die Fragen und Probleme der Gäste hatte. Außerdem gab sie gerne wertvolle Tipps für Ausflüge und Touren. Die ehemalige Masserie liegt etwas außerhalb von der Kleinstadt Mesagne, inmitten eines Olivenhaines mit zum Teil sehr alten Olivenbäumen.Ein Mietwagen ist auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen.Sehr schöne Zimmer, großer Pool, sehr schmackhaftes Essen. Hotel sehr zu empfehlen",5,2014,07,21
06,Absolute Überklasse,"Weit besser als der Durchschnitt der (zu) vielen 4-Stern Hotels in Italien. Erstklassig in jeder Beziehung, mit einem hervorragenden Preis/Leistungsverhältnis. Guter Ausgangspunkt für Ausflüge, die Lage im Landesinnern ist da ein grosser Vorteil.",5,2014,07,09
06,Oasi di pace,"E' da qualche anno che trascorriamo dei piacevolissimi weekend e brevi soggiorni a Tenuta Moreno. Una vera oasi di pace….Stanze dagli arredi delicati e raffinati, dotate di terrazzini dove gustare l’ottima colazione o un aperitivo, coccolati dal simpatico cinguettio degli uccelli. Una grande piscina attorniata da un bel prato verde e da palme che garantiscono zone d’ombra in ogni momento della giornata dove poter gustare ghiotti stuzzichini a pranzo o leggere un buon libro. Assolutamente da non perdere, il giovedì sera, la ‘serata tipica’ con degustazione  a buffet di ogni genere di prodotti tipici pugliesi (dai latticini all’arrosto, dolci, ecc.). E….vera perla della Tenuta, il personale cordiale, sempre disponibile, simpatico….non citiamo i nomi solo perché non li ricordiamo tutti e non vorremmo dimenticare alcuno!",5,2014,07,04
06,Un paradiso,"Ho soggiornato per un fine settimana in questa stupenda struttura. Posto molto ben curato, stanze spaziose con letti super spaziosi. Ristorante di qualità con personale molto cordiale. Piscina come ai tropici ...bella, enorme e ben tenuta.
Buono il rapporto qualità prezzo. Bella anche la SPA.",4,2014,07,03
06,Tutto Perfetto!!!!,"Che dire...........assolutamente da rivisitare..........tutto perfetto: dall'accoglienza con personale veramente gentile, alla pulizia quasi maniacale delle stanze, il cibo ottimo il servizio eccellente.........per non parlare della SPA, davvero magnifica. 
Per chi non è mai andato, Lo consiglio vivamente!!!",5,2014,06,27
06,Fantastico,"Non riesco a trovare una nota negativa a questa splendida struttura! Ci sono stata più volte per varie cerimonie ed ho trovato sempre tutto perfetto, cibo ottimo , materie prime freschissime e lavorare alla perfezione, servizio eccellente e pulizia impeccabile! Dopo averci anche soggiornato ed aver usufruito della SPA posso dire che è veramente il top! La SPA è piccolina ma ben gestita con personale professionale, camere belle, pulite e spaziose! Il prezzo è abbastanza alto ma ne vale la pena! ",5,2014,06,25
06,Ristorante per ricevimento davvero impeccabile,"Ho frequentato questa struttura in passato per diversi eventi (matrimoni, convegni) e sono sempre rimasto favorevolmente colpito tanto dalla bellezza della struttura, ben curata, quanto dall'organizzazione perfetta degli eventi.
Tant'è che con mia moglie abbiamo deciso di festeggiare in questo posto incantevole, il battesimo di nostro figlio, avvenuto lo scorso agosto.
Cena davvero straordinaria, con aperitivo di mare e fritti preparati al momento. Di seguito, all'interno della sala, ancora antipasti, primo all'astice, secondi mare/terra. Una splendida carta dei vini.
Buffet di dolci in uno spazio esterno suggestivo incorniciato da un meraviglioso gioco di luci ed una piccola piscina.
Personale professionalmente preparato e cortese ad ogni richiesta. Ottimo anche l'approccio tanto con il Direttore che con la Organizzatrice di eventi, anch'essi sempre disponibili.
Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.
Un evento indimenticabile come volevamo che fosse per il battesimo del nostro primo figlio. 
Consiglio di provare anche l'hotel e la splendida piscina.",5,2014,06,17
06,Che bella Tenuta!,"Sono stato da queste parti un po di tempo fa per lavoro (2007). Questa struttura è spettacolare!
Peccato non averla goduta in tutto il suo splendore... purtroppo uscivo presto la mattina e tornavo proprio tardi la sera :-(
Le camere sono enormi con letti da 2 piazze e mezza!
La colazione è spettacolare... porterò sempre nel mio cuore i cornetti ripieni di cioccolato fondente!
Spero di ritornarci con la mia famiglia
Per quanto riguarda la posizione...siamo a Mesagne... è una tenuta.... Relax e basta!",5,2014,06,14
06,Matrimonio MaChi,"Abbiamo festeggiato il nostro matrimonio l'11.06.2014, è stato tutto perfetto dalla location, davvero stupenda e molto curata, al personale in sala, davvero all'altezza. Siamo stati coccolati sin dal nostro arrivo e per tutta la giornata e non solo, ma anche il giorno successivo, perche siamo stati ospiti della struttura avendo avendo a  nostra disposizione una stanza per la notte, il percorso benessere il giorno successivo,l'uso della piscina ed il pranzo. La qualità, partendo dal buffet degli antipasti passando ai primi ed ai secondi sino ad arrivare al buffet di frutta e dolci è stato eccezionale per qualità degli alimenti e presentazione degli stessi, inoltre particolare attenzione per quelle persone che hanno stili alimentari diversi dal solito. Ringrazio tutto lo staff della struttura, in particolare Daniela ed il suo papà, che ci ha seguito sino al termine della serata, ed il fantastico direttore Pierangelo Argentieri. Una struttura che merita davvero l'eccellenza come giudizio complessivo.",5,2014,06,12
06,Matrimonio Erika&Antonio,"Ho conosciuto Tenuta Moreno in occasione del mio ricevimento di nozze. Tutto è stato organizzato nei minimi dettagli, senza lasciare nulla al caso. Ogni nostra richiesta è stata soddisfatta e quel giorno è stato come essere in famiglia, grazie alla gentilezza e alla cordialità di tutto lo staff.
La varietà degli ambienti ci ha,poi, permesso di impostare la nostra giornata, in modo che ogni momento fosse caratterizzato in modo diverso. 
Un posto semplicemente meraviglioso..",5,2014,06,03
06,Ottimo,"Abbiamo festeggiato un evento importante a Cena, tutto è stato perfetto!
L'organizzazione fatta da ' Daniela ' è stata ineccepibile.
La qualità del cibo molto alta e la presentazione dei piatti davvero molto curata.
Il tutto con un servizio impeccabile di ' Giovanni ' davvero un professionista nel suo campo.
La location molto curata dalla parte esterna a quella interna.
Che dire....Super consigliato!",5,2014,05,23
06,Favoloso,"Una meraviglia di posto, con un vastissimo aranceto ed una favolosa piscina! Ho celebrato li' la mia prima Comunione e siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti! Cucina meravigliosa e raffinata. Posti così, al giorno d'oggi sono rari! L'ho adorato e spero di ritornarci!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2014,05,20
06,Cena di ricorrenza Prima Comunione ,"Posto splendido. Servizio ottimo, solo un po' lunga attesa.(Solo perché tutte le sale occupate dell'affluenza del pranzo) Comunque ne valsa l'attesa. Complimenti. Sarà  mia premura divulgare la mia impressione ad amici e conoscenti.",4,2014,05,19
06,Posto stupendo,"Posto bellissimo dove cura dei dettagli e comfort lo rendono un posto romantico, dove potersi rilassare , ma anche per trascorrere del tempo in un posto incantato con la propria famiglia; la cucina qui fa la differenza dove il Bio è vero e la scelta degli elementi è gustosa ed originale; completano il tutto il personale disponibile e molto professionale !",5,2014,05,19
06,LOCATION DA FAVOLA,"Ottima location per eventi di tutti i tipi, SPA e tanto relax, cucina buona, colazione a buffet di ogni genere. Ci sono stato per lavoro ma il posto si adatta ad ogni necessitá, personale gentile e professionale.",5,2014,05,16
06,OTTIMO!!!,"Giro abbastanza per lavoro, specie in Puglia, e questa è senza dubbio la location ideale perfettamente equidistante (circa 30 min) sia da Taranto che da Brindisi e Lecce. Il posto è incantevole, il personale cordiale, le camere spaziose e pulite, la colazione deliziosa.",5,2014,05,15
06,incantevole,"Ottimo resort qualita' del servizio alta ,per noi che giriamo parecchio all'estero devo dire che e' un'eccellenza  per l'italia,noi abbiamo scelto la tenuta x posizione logistica nella visita dell'entroterra e sia la costa Adriatica che Ionica.",5,2014,05,09
06,Veramente bello,"Struttura molto bella e ben valorizzata con gli elementi locali (ulivi, macchia mediterranea, muri a secco, ecc...). Personale disponibile e cordiale. Spazi esterni curati. Il mare non è lontanissimo, in compenso abbastanza vicino ai maggiori luoghi turistici del Salento",4,2014,04,28
06,...SI RASSENTA LA PERFEZIONE,"Ho soggiornato due giorni presso la Tenuta Moreno con mio marito, utilizzando il pacchetto Pasqua 2014. Ospitalità, cordialità e professionalità sono le caratteristiche che definiscono questa struttura. Le stanze meravigliosamente accoglienti con bagni altrettanto confortevoli. La cucina è a livelli altissimi, il cibo è fresco e lo staff della sala è eccellente. Pensate che ho fatto un fioretto pasquale (non potevo mangiare dolci fino a pasqua). Bene, a mezzanotte del sabato ho ricevuto in camera un vassoio di dolci.. sono stati Strepitosi!!! La Spa è spaziosa, pulita ed accogliente con personale simpatico e cortese! Un grazie va a Paola che ci ha deliziato con della frutta fresca a fine percorso benessere.. ed in ultimo ma non per importanza, un grazie va alle dolcissime ragazze Emanuela, Daniela e Perla che dall'accoglienza all'arrivederci si prendono cura dei clienti che soggiornano presso la tenuta. Io e mio marito consigliamo vivamente di trascorrere qualche giorno presso la Tenuta... Non ve ne pentirete !!!!!!",5,2014,04,20
06,Relax immersi nella natura,"Arrivato per un convegno nel tardo pomeriggio, ho apprezzato l'accoglienza, con stuzzichini vari e mozzarella direttamente dalle mani del casaro. Il luogo è incantevole, un'antica masseria ristrutturata immersa  tra gli oliveti e gli aranceti. Il servizio è di alto livello, ottimi i pasti, serviti in un ampio e luminoso salone, ma ho notato anche una deliziosa saletta riservata con caminetto. Non ho potuto apprezzare la Spa, purtroppo. La qualità del sonno è eccellente, nessun rumore molesto, tanto silenzio e pace durante la notte. Le stanze sono molto ampie e arredate in tono con la struttura, i bagni ampi e spaziosi, con dotazione apprezzabile. Io amo gli arredamenti moderni, forse per questo non ho dato il punteggio massimo. Ottima la ricezione wi-fi in tutta la struttura. Bellissimo il cortile con aranceto per colazioni e pause lavori.",4,2014,04,16
06,Divertimento e relax,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per l'occasione del matrimonio del mio miglior amico. E dopo un magnifico ricevimento nel quale ho potuto degustare un sacco di prodotti locali ( forse troppo), ho avuto nei giorni seguenti l'occasione di godermi anche il resto che la struttura offre. Total relax e infinite coccole nella SPA, dove il personale è altamente qualificato e gentile. Camere confortevoli e pulizia eccellente. La cosa che più mi ha affascinato è stata l'idea di essere immersi in grandi ettari di verde. Quegli odori di primavera nonostante sia passato quasi un anno me li ricordo ancora. Forse la nostalgia si fa sentire e anche il pensiero di ritornare a soggiornare li ancora una volta?!",5,2014,03,26
06,WEEK END,"ho acquistato il pacchetto ""INSIEME A TE STO BENE"" e devo dire che lo stare bene sottinteso ovviamente con la mia ragazza lo devo estendere a tutta l'organizzazione, la struttura, i servizi... quando ti capita di girare per locali è quasi normale ad esempio trovare anche i piccoli difetti estetici o strutturali ma alla TENUTA MORENO si rasenta la perfezione!!!
Il personale poi è impeccabile, un mix perfetto di cordialità e professionalità a cominciare dalla prima richiesta di informazioni via mail (Emanuela è stata ineccepibile) ed all'assistenza in reception e nella Beauty Farm (ragazze specializzate e preparate tutte un saluto a Paola). La camera un incanto, il trattamento benessere lascia a bocca aperta anche gli scettici come me, ho fatto un regalo alla mia ragazza ma poi sono rimasto incantato anch'io. La colazione ed il pranzo abbondanti è dire poco, un lusso davvero sontuoso!

consigliarlo a chiunque mi sembra scontatissimo

un saluto FABIO!",5,2014,03,14
06,Meraviglioso!!!!,"Ho soggiornato due notti presso la tenuta moreno in occasione del matrimonio di un amico e mi sono trovato benissimo; la camera al primo piano della struttura é abbastanza grande, il bagno ha la cabina doccia ed è dotata di ogni comfort anche dell'asciuga capelli; le camere hanno un balconcino privato che si affaccia su un'elegante corte interna. La struttura é molto grande, ideale per cerimonie e meeting. Io e la mia fidanzata abbiamo usufruito anche del centro benessere, non molto grande ma comunque completo di tutto. Ci ritornerò sicuramente.",5,2014,03,07
06,bellissima giornata ^ relax day^,"Fuga relax presso tenuta moreno per un giorno.
assolutamente giornata di benessere e relax.
Centro benessere fantastico al di sopra delle aspettative. Le foto del sito di per se molto belle non rendono la bellezza della beauty farm. Moderna spaziosa e molto pulita.
Un grazie particolare a Paola per tutte le cure e la disponibilita  che ci ha dedicato e i complimenti per la sua professionalita e bravura nei massaggi.
Ora che vi abbiamo scoperti ci ritorneremo sicuramente.
Giornata conclusa con un ottimo pranzo con servizio molto celere e cortese nella piccola e riservata cantina.",5,2014,02,22
06,Weekend San Valentino,"Appena rientrati dal weekend di San Valentino e devo dire ke le aspettative sono state mantenute,ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo,da ripetere unica pecca se così la si può chiamare la mancanza di una piscina coperta,x il resto gli spazi sono ottimizzati al massimo.Lo consiglio sicuramente
",4,2014,02,16
06,... Delizioso.,"Sono stata in questa bellissima struttura il 27 dicembre. 
Ho regalato una giornata al centro benessere a me e una mia amica ... 

È una struttura meravigliosa, il personale è competente e gentilissimo. 
La camera di cortesia un lusso unico e il centro benessere una favola. 

Consiglio a tutti un pranzo o una cena presso TENUTA MORENO,  per la squisitezza dei pasti e consiglio ancor di più un massaggio della meravigliosa Paola che da un tocco personale a ogni minima cosa nel centro. 

Super consigliato.... 
Perfetto!",5,2014,02,10
06,La calma assoluta,"siamo stati con la famiglia in questo hotel curatissimo sia nella gestione delle camere che nella ristorazione, l'atmosfera della cena in cortile è sublime. piscina enorme anche se distaccata dal complesso che risulterebbe un tantino scomodo ma nel complesso confortevole. Lettone enorme forse 3 piazze? Se proprio devo trovare un difetto, forse  il fatto che dista un po dal centro abitato e che dopo 4 giorni di relax potrebbe venir voglia di fare due passi in centro!",4,2014,01,03
06,Posto davvero bello!!,"Posto molto bello! SPA molto accogliente! Ottimo personale.., abbiamo soggiornato solo per due notti... Però ci ritorneremo! Personale esperto e educato! Ottimo massaggio!!! Spazi aperti e ben curati! Pieno di fiori! Questa struttura la consigli",4,2013,12,26
06,Spa davvero rilassante,"Insieme ad un'amica, ho trascorso un piacevole pomeriggio all'interno del centro benessere di Tenuta Moreno: semplicemente stupendo!

Ambiente molto rilassante, musica soft e percorso benessere al top!
Molto brave anche le massaggiatrici Anna e Paola, cordiali e professionali.
Mi è piaciuto molto il bagno turco e la vasca idromassaggio. Ben organizzato anche l'angolo relax con tisane e biscottini, tutto molto buono:)

Consigliato!",5,2013,12,01
06,un bel posto !!!,"Ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare, solo per una notte però, in questa tenuta alle porte del Salento e posso senz'altro affermare : un bel posto.
La Tenuta Moreno però deve essere apprezzata per più giorni ed utilizzando tutti i servizi proposti. 
Spazi aperti enormi e molto bne curati, il giardino è spettacolare e la location tra gli ulivi secolari rende molto bucolico il posto.
Le sale (diverse) del ristorante sono di gran fascino e molto eleganti ( non ho apprezzato però la cucina). 
Dalle camere invece mi aspettavo molto molto di più : sia per un marchi a quattro stelle che per la scenografica hall ma poi per il costo del pernottamento.
Non è che sono stato ""male"" anzi appunto per la struttura proposta le camere non sono all'altezza...
Personale cortese e disponibile,colazione corposa e variegata.
Sicuramente da approfondire il tutto nei prossimi pernottamenti.
La SPA purtroppo era chiusa (giorno di riposo) quindi nessun giudizio in merito.",3,2013,11,21
06,Ottimo massaggio,"In trasferta per una giornata intensa di lavoro, mi sono imbattuto in questa splendida struttura.Massaggio eccellente, mix ideale di energia e relax.
Molto cordiale e professionale l' operatrice, Anna.
consiglialtissimo.",5,2013,11,17
06,"Il posto è certamente bellissimo, però...","ho dormito 2 notti in questa struttura. indubbiamente un gran posto. Spazi aperti infiniti, belle piscine, bellissime sale ristorante, comoda lobby, ottimo mangiare. Camere molto ben arredate in stile moderno non radicale con bagni confortevolissimi e una linea cortesia completa anche delle ciabatte. mi chiederete perché non do i 5 pallini... 1) per il personale. tolta una gentilissima ragazza bruna, attenta e disponibile, ho trovato superficialità, supponenza e poco calore... 2) colazione disorganizzata. cibi e bevande ci sono, ma la gestione del servizio è certamente da migliorare molto",4,2013,11,13
06,immer wieder Tenuta Moreno,"Innerhalb von einem Jahr zweimal hier in diesem schönen Hotel eingecheckt und es zweimal nicht bereut. Schönes Ambiente, super nettes Personal, schmackhaftes Essen....la Dolce Vita pur. Die ehemalige Massaria ist zu einem wunderschönen Hotel umgebaut worden. Großer Pool, tolle Frühstücksterrasse, eigener Gemüse- und Kräutergarten, SPA Bereich und und und.....",5,2013,11,13
06,che bel posto,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questa location fantastica per due notti per partecipare ad un incontro di lavoro. La tenuta, piuttosto isolata (se cercate la vita notturna e/o il mare, questo posto non fa per voi), è veramente una meraviglia, anche se siamo in bassa stagione e le piscine sono chiuse e c'è qualche foglia di troppo in giro. Le camere sono ampie, dotate di bei bagni, con prodotti per il corpo di buona qualità, nonché di piccola terrazza con zanzariera per proteggere gli ospiti dagli insetti.
Ci sono degli aspetti sui quali si potrebbe lavorare maggiormente:
1)in un hotel del genere la visione di sky dovrebbe essere compresa nel prezzo della camera e non a pagamento;
2)la cena della prima sera è stata piuttosto lenta, anche se i piatti erano pregevoli;
3)la colazione non presentava una grande varietà, soprattutto per quanto riguarda il salato;
4)ho contattato la reception perché pensavo di aver lasciato in camera gli occhiali da vista quando sono ripartita, mi hanno detto che mi avrebbero ricontattata quanto prima per farmi sapere se li avessero trovati o meno: è passato un giorno e non sono stata ancora richiamata...
5)alla reception non avevano opuscoli informativi sui luoghi da visitare nelle vicinanze e il personale non è stato in grado di sopperire fornendo suggerimenti, se non piuttosto generici.

In conclusione: tornerei sicuramente, ma durante l'estate, soprattutto per il posto e non per il cibo.",4,2013,11,07
06,Dimora di charme ma poco relax...,"Eravamo solo di passaggio in questa bellissima struttura perchè la nostra intenzione era quella di rilassarci con una giornata in spa.Siamo arrivati in tarda mattinata e ci è stato detto che era ormai tardi anche solo per usufruire del centro senza massaggi visto che avrebbero chiuso di lì a poco per la pausa (a me sembra che un albergo del genere che sponsorizza giornate day spa dovrebbe perlomeno fare orario continuato e non far tornare gli ospiti addirittura alle 16.30 quando è già buio).Ad ogni modo abbiamo deciso di tornare prenotando anche un massaggio da 50€ a persona per 30 min.....devono essere eccezionali ho pensato!!!!!!!!
Pensiamo di pranzare lì e potevamo veramente risparmiarcelo;5€ per 3 frittini di numero in uno spiedino come antipasto(sapevo che non potevamo aspettarci tanto con quel prezzo ma roba surgelata e prefritta no). Continuo con un fritto dell'Adriatico (non scherzo, avevo in bocca come retrogusto candeggina pura, tipico del pesce scongelato soprattutto di totani e gamberi, non te lo aspetti da un posto così), mio marito pasta al salmone discreta.Acqua naturale e 38€!!
Nel pomeriggio inizia il nostro rilassamento...idromassaggio, bagno turco, sauna e bagno alle erbe che mi è piaciuto molto...relax con tisana e frutta secca ma poi il massaggio...........
Manovre molto dure, gomiti piantati nella schiena e nel collo, quasi piango ma penso di essere troppo contratta io e che mi possa sciogliere un pò....sono passati 3 giorni e mi sento come se qualcuno mi avesse picchiato...mi fa ancora male tutto:non è normale!!!!!!!!!!
Mi spiace tanto perchè tante cose mi sono piaciute come la location e la gentilezza alla reception ma il nervosismo in spa l'ho notato anche io.Non so se tornerei....",3,2013,11,02
06,Buono,"Bello l'hotel sebbene sia posizionato in una strada piuttosto isolata e non illuminata (se conoscete la puglia, sapete che è una condizione comune alla gran parte delle strutture alberghiere). Le camere sono accoglienti e pulite ma vi suggerisco di richiedere quelle ristrutturate perchè quelle 'vecchie' non sono altrettanto belle. Il ristorante è carino e offre un buon servizio (buon rapporto qualità prezzo) oltre che del buon cibo (porzioni piuttosto piccole).
Unico neo è la sala colazione dove, se l'hotel è affollato, risulta difficile trovar posto oltre che cibo. 
Il personale è misto: molto cortese e accogliente al ristorante, decisamente freddo e poco accogliente alla reception.",4,2013,11,02
06,Tra natura e tranquillità,"Soggiorno spesso per lavoro in questa struttura e la trovo sempre molto elegante ad all'altezza del livello che ci si aspetta. Stanze ampie e ben illuminate.. Pulizia e oridine sia fuori che dentro le camere.Ampia area relax immersa nella natura e grande piscina. Simpatici i box doccia cromatici per il relax..
Il ristorante è di alto livello. Forse un pochino caro.
Suggerisco un ritorno ai dispenser di saponi con essenze di qualche tempo fa.. molto apprezzati!!",5,2013,10,26
06,ospitalità e natura,ci sono stata per un evento (matrimonio). ottimo tutto: professionalità del personale e cura degli ambienti. molto bella la piscina esterna dove ci siamo ritrovati attraversando un giardino ed un orto. sicuramente ci ritornerò per la spa che in quella occasione non ho potuto sperimentare ...,4,2013,10,11
06,"""Da non perdere""","Ho avuto, negli ultimi tre anni, in tre occasioni,  il piacere di soggiornare e pranzare alla Tenuta Moreno.La location è incantevole, con delle camere bellissime, minimal ma eleganti e gli ambienti comuni molto curati. I ragazzi che ci lavorano sono tutti molto giovani e ben preparati, si vede che amano ciò che fanno. Di conseguenza, il servizio è impeccabile e di alto livello.
A tavola, oltre all'apparenza, il meglio arriva già alle prime degustazioni. Da sottolineare la ricerca di nuovi sapori ed il sapiente utilizzo degli ingredienti, accuratamente selezionati e di primissima qualità. Ogni ulteriore parola sarebbe superflua e, comunque, insufficiente a descrivere questa favolosa esperienza sia di soggiorno che culinaria.",5,2013,10,10
06,cibo scadente e location da svecchiare,"ci sono stata l'anno scorso  per un matrimonio...mi avevano parlato di questa sala come una lussuosa sala a 5 stelle...ma forse nel 1990!!cibo scadente,antipasti di pesce per niente freschi e primi molto scontati forse perchè non c'è la cucina e quindi il cibo viene preparato altrove...location classica,all'esterno solita piscina cn le palme disposte qua e la e gli interni praticamente anni 80...secondo me dovrebbero dare una svecchiata a tutto l'ambiente..delusione totale",2,2013,10,01
06,ristorazione? siamo lontanissimi anni luce,"Tenuta Moreno: bellissima struttura esternamente ma internamente sfiora la mediocrita' per quanto concerne il personale di sala dovrebbero fargli fare un corso per imparare cosa significhi educazione e simpatia. Per quanto concerne il cibo il settore mare e' da bocciare in primis... non fresco, cucinato con artifizi per nascondere l anzianita' da congelatore, i primi tra cui i risotti disgustosi', i secondi sconnessi e sciapiti, patatine fritte squallide, dolci accettabili ma quantita' risicate .",2,2013,10,01
06,Molto bello,"Siamo stati in quest'hotel a fine marzo 2013 per una sola notte, su consiglio di un'amica, e veramente e'bello come ci era stato descritto. Una bella stanza e un ottima colazione. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile. Molto tranquillo e bello e ben curato tutto il giardino che lo circonda.",5,2013,09,29
06,Versatile - OK!,"Sono ritornato a soggiornare in questa struttura e la trovo affascinante e migliorata. Bellissima e ampia piscina esterna, caratteristico il bar con il trulletto. Molto, molto piacevole passeggiare in lungo ed in largo fra i corridoi gli spazi ed il parco. Valido per le vacanze in campagna e come base lavorativa per il Salento. Magica la colazione all'aperto.",4,2013,09,24
06,Ottimo. Da ritornare.,"Struttura esemplare, perfettamente manutenuta, nascosta da ulivi secolari. Non ho provato spa e piscina ma l'accoglienza perfetta e la disponibilità di piccoli e preziosi plus come il latte di mandorla che vi accoglie all'arrivo mi convincono che questo posto è all'altezza della sua fama. Colazione molto buona, anche se ci si aspetterebbero forse più specialità locali. Complessivamente il giudizio è ottimo.",5,2013,09,17
06,delusione!,"abbiamo soggiornato con amci x 1 notte, appena arrivati l'accoglienza è stata buona, ci hanno offerto qualcosa da bere e dato ke le camere nn erano pronte abbiamo fatto un giro per visitare la struttura. in realtà l'attesa per la camera è durata un po troppo...circa 2 ore, e il check in molto lento. La camera, vicino la spa, era molto grande, il letto enorme ma con i comodini pieni di polvere e con le spalliere delle dormose impolverate. le pareti pieni di buchini, dove forse erano appesi dei quadri o altro e gli angoli dei muri erano sbeccati. ho dovuto pulire i comodini con le salviettine. Vabbè, pensiamo a rilassarci...così decidiamo di prenotare un massaggio relax total body. accoglienza pessima nella spa, dato ke stavano facendo pulizie. ci siamo accomodate nelle rispettive cabine e la musica di sottofondo nn era da massaggio, infatti dopo circa 10 minuti l'hanno cambiata (nel bel mezzo del massaggio). il massaggio non era assolutamente rilassante e siamo certi ke sia durato molto meno del previsto...era un massaggio snervante, le manovre lente ed avvolgenti come dalla descrizione, nn sanno nemmeno cosa significano. insomma €50,00 buttati. ki può apprezzare questi modi di fare?
la domenica mattina siamo andati nella sala per la colazione e le cameriere sono state scortesi e nevrotiche. 
Ah! dimenticavo! altri amici del gruppo hanno avuto camere diverse dalla nostra, cioè NUOVE, RISTRUTTURATE e soprattuto PULITE, allo stesso prezzo della nostra. e nn mi sembra corretto. le camere vecchie nn le proponete!!",2,2013,09,16
06,ELEGANZA UNITA ALLA GENUINITA' E AL SERVIZIO IMPECCABILE E' DA SEMPRE IL RICHIAMO DELLA STRUTTURA,"Conosco la struttura da oltre un decennio in quanto ospite in occasioni quali i matrimoni, e per aver organizzato in prima persona gli eventi importanti della mia famiglia che gradivo rimanessero ricordi indelebili nel tempo. Così dopo aver festeggiato battesimo, prima comunione e Cresima di mio figlio, anche per  il suo 18 volevamo che rimanesse un ricordo nel tempo.Nonostante le numerose strutture nei d'intorni, bellissime anch'esse, non  abbiamo esitato  a rivolgerci direttamente a questo meraviglioso Hotel che abbiamo visto crescere nel tempo sempre in meglio. La festa è stata organizzata nei minimi dettagli e particolari e pur trattandosi di un rinfresco per circa 50 ragazzi tutto è stato adeguato all'evento sempre con classe, servizio impeccabile contorniato dalla struttura che non lascia spazi ad altre parole. In una location separata è stata organizzata la cena per gli adulti, tutto a base di pesce accompagnata dalla coreografia dei piatti . Il buffet di frutta e dolci ha chiuso, sempre molto elegantemente nella presentazione, l'evento.Un ringraziamento al Direttore Pierangelo Argentieri, persona disponibile che cura e suggerisce l'organizzazione di questi eventi.",5,2013,09,15
06,mancanza di spirito imprenditoriale,"Lo scorso mese di agosto sono stato qualche giorno in questa antica masseria. Il posto è incantevole: una struttura alberghiera inserita in un contesto naturale unico a 5 chilometri da Mesagne, cittadina peraltro molto interessante.
Purtroppo devo rilevare alcune superficialità da un lato e uno spirito di iniziativa non al massimo.
Io e mia moglie eravamo in una camera confort. Peccato che nella stanza si rilevasse la mancanza di una lampada a muro staccata di prepotenza  con eliminazione dalla plafoniera anche del pulsante di accensione lasciando fili elettrici scoperti.
Anche nel bagno sopra la vasca mancava il porta teli, anche quello sembrava essere stato stradicato con prepotenza tant'è che si vedevano chiaramente i fori delle viti di sostegno  nel muro.
Mi domando: perché una struttura così bella deve avere queste evidente carenze? Ma il responsabile dell'albergo non visita mai le camere per vedere se è tutto a posto? Il servizio manutenzioni dorme?
Infine. L'albergo ospitava diversi turisti stranieri provenienti principalmente dalla Germania e dalla Gran Bretagna. Non credo che tutti siano arrivati con mezzi propri, ma, diversi, presumo con l'aereo. Quindi erano di fatto senza mezzi di trasporto salvo poter noleggiare un'auto (ci abbiamo provato anche noi, ma senza trovare un'auto disponibile). L'unica offerta da parte della reception era poter usufruire di una navetta da e verso Mesagne e/o un centro commerciale. Quello che ha lasciato tutti noi delusi è il fatto che l'albergo non aveva soluzioni alternative come l'offerta di tour giornalieri verso località conosciute in tutte il mondo e a pochi kilometri di distanza (ad es.: Grottaglie, Castellana Grotte, Alberobello o, con qualche kilometro in più: Lecce e il Salento). Penso che questa iniziativa avrebbe riscosso un grande successo tra la clientela.",3,2013,09,13
06,GENUINITA' e LUSSO,"Abbiamo usufruito di un pacchetto day-spa con camera di cortesia e cena. Tutto stupendo! Camera pulita e spaziosa con grazioso balconcino sul giardino e super-letto king size! Molto bella anche la SPA, piano alto e tutto intorno vetri con affaccio sul verde Pugliese! La cena deliziosa, con prodotti genuini a km 0 (coltivati all'interno della Tenuta) e servizio eccellente!",5,2013,09,10
06,Resort a 4 stelle e le merita tutte,"Siamo stati per un fine settimana in questo bellissimo resort, nel verde del campagna salentina. Ottima impressione, disponibilità e gentilezza da parte del personale. Camere spaziose (suite). Bella cabina doccia con una illuminazione d'effetto. Buona colazione, servita all'aperto (qualche insetto di troppo). Non  abbiamo provato il ristorante, (costo €35.00). Inclusa nella nostra tariffa l'accesso alla Spa di cui è dotata la struttura. La piscina era molto grande e bella anche se leggermente al di sotto del livello dell'hotel: un pò di verde in più non avrebbe guastato. Complessivamente un bellissimo weekend, da consigliare e ripetere.",5,2013,09,10
06,Relax ed eccellenza in tutto!!!,"Cortesia e garbo sono le doti principali del personale. Le camere sono dotate di tutti i confort, molto comode e abbastanza spaziose, con verandina annessa. Su richiesta é disponibile Sky. La pulizia é superlativa. Il marchio ""Tenuta Moreno"" spicca ovunque: ciabatte, asciugamani, bottiglie d'acqua. Persino sul cesto dell'immondizia e sulle placche degli interruttori per la luce.
Consiglio la SPA per un relax assoluto. Troverete vasca idromassaggio, doccia emozionale, bagno turco, sauna, sauna alle erbe... i lettini rilassanti vi ""abbracceranno"" mentre vi gusterete una tisana. Il tempo nella SPA sembra fermarsi e ne uscirete rigenerati. Il bar per la colazione accontenta tutti: dalla colazione con latte e biscotti allo jogurt, alla frutta, alle spremute, accompagnate da un mix prelibato di cornetti, crostate e dolciumi vari, ai panini con vari tipi di affettati, alle uova...
A disposizione ci sono anche campi di calcio, tennis e pallavolo. Oltre alla stupenda piscina.
Un posto incantevole, dove rilassarsi e gustare prelibatezze culinarie.

Ottimo il servizio in piscina (si può mangiare serviti all'ombra degli ulivi e rilassarsi al sole negli ampi spazi sia in erba che pavimentati intorno all'enorme piscina). 
Ambienti (esterni ed interni) curatissimi e di gran gusto estetico.
Superiore alla media la pulizia. 
Piccola nota: la stanza che mi è stata assegnata, la n.220 con affaccio sul cortile interno (escludendo il magnifico lettone super kingsize!!), non era all'altezza del livello qualitativo della Struttura, ma ho avuto modo di vedere altre stanze e qui l'arredo era decisamente in linea con l'eleganza del Resort.

Camere e bagni molto belli ed ampi. Il personale è molto cortese ed efficiente. E' presente una animazione molto simpatica per bambini, e per niente invadente.

Al ristorante si mangia benissimo e consiglio la scelta di pesce con piatti raffinati e gustosi, grazie anche al servizio eccellente, Francesco  e Adolfo e tutto il personale!! una piccola nota  negativa all'animazione che devo dire ...molto soft, giocavano in piscina con una pallina, avrei preferito che almeno uno di loro visto  erano in due si occupasse  anche dei bimbi più grandi  i miei avevano 10 e 14 anni magari organizzando qualche torneo di calcetto o qualche gioco adatto ai bimbi junior!!  ma per il resto direi voto 9,5.

06,"Una tenuta da competizione, immersa nel suo verdesmeraldo","Salve a tutti,
Che dire...semplicemente un esperienza unica ed entusiasmante , ottima per chi vuole staccare la spina ed immergersi in quelle che sono le tradizioni tipiche di questa terra . La struttura  innanzitutto si presenta ben strutturata dal punto di vista architettonico , semplice e accogliente ma il pezzo forte degli spazi esterni sono i vasti giardini  che circondano l' intera struttura . Il tutto e' arricchito da una piscina mozzafiato dove potersi rilassare tranquillamente  con la famiglia con gli amici o semplicemente in solitudine .la piscina offre a disposizione bagni d'appoggio rigorosamente puliti  e servizio bar  al consumo dove e' possibile stuzzicare  sandwich , piatti freddi ecc... o magari bere un drink , un cappuccino insomma per qualsiasi cosa desideriate troverete a vostra completa disposizione un staff molto educato che cerchera' di accontentarvi in ogni vostra esigenza. La reception si presenta molto tranquilla , gli spazi molto ampi e il personale educato e professionale  ma parliamo della camera, un posto molto accogliente architettato per riprendere non eccessivamente quello che era l'aspetto delle vecchie abitazioni locali ,servizi igenici e di pulizie  ottimi  , unica pecca l'aria condizionata troppo fredda e non regolabile al cento per cento. Spostandoci nella zona antica della struttura ci si puo' recare nella zona bar dove poter bere  un aperitivo in completa tranquillità prima della cena , lo spazio e arricchito da numerosi giardini ed una piscina estetica  scavata nella roccia , la sera invece questo posto si trasforma ... spettacoli di animazione, balli tipici e musica d'ambiente ; al bar Alessandro lo stesso ragazzo presente nello staff piscina vi presentera' cocktail come non li avete mai visti ,dalle splendide decorazionie e dal gusto unico.il ristorante in fine ""Sublime"" i primi piatti dal gusto eccezzionale e ben presentati , il buffet degli antipasti ben ricco di pietanze locali ,nulla da togliere al buffet delle colazioni sempre ben presentato e continuamente rinnovato , l' unica pecca sono le mosche, molto fastidiose al mattino ; lo staff del risorante molto professionale e disponibile anche se al mattino non tutti mantengono la loro costanza nella disponibilita' chiacchierando del piu' o del meno a volte per parecchio tempo ",4,2013,07,13

Senza alcun dubbio è un resort tra i più belli della Puglia e non solo. Personale gentilissimo, competente e disponibile. La cucina e la cantina ben fornita sono tra le più raffinate che io abbia mai provato. Solo un visionario poteva ipotizzare di costruire una struttura così lussuosa in aperta campagna. Ma, a ragion veduta, la scommessa è stata ampiamente vinta. Sicuramente questo resort rappresenta un punto di riferimento tra le strutture alberghiere più rinomate del sud Italia. Io credo che il merito vada ascritto a chi da anni gestisce questa struttura con competenza e con straordinaria lungimiranza. Complimenti davvero!!!",5,2013,07,08

Per non parlare poi dell'ottimo pranzo : un trionfo di stuzzichini con aperitivo, antipasti vari, deliziosi primi, ottimi secondi, squisiti dolci, il tutto 
""apparecchiato"" e servito con classe, ed innaffiato da eccellenti vini pugliesi.

06,Gutes Hotel,"Empfehlenswertes Hotel, allerdings etwas abseits gelegen. Zimmer waren in Ordnung, Hotelpersonal war freundlich und hilfsbereit. Am besten war die  Gästebetreuerin Mariella. Sie spricht perfekt deutsch, zeigt einem die sehr schöne Anlage und erklärt bei einem Spaziergang durch die Felder den Pflanzenreichtum und die Verarbeitung der Früchte in der Küche. Gemeinsam mit einer Kollegin führt sie Kochkurse durch, bei denen die Gäste die Produktion hausgemachter Nudeln lernen.
Das Speiseangebot dürfte noch etwas abwechslungsreicher sein, insbesondere wenn es um Salate und Gemüse geht.
Das Frühstück war bei uns ok, natürlich typisch italienisch.

La fortuna ha poi voluto che la giornata fosse caratterizzata da temperatire molto alte, dandoci quindi la possibilità di vivere appieno anche il giardino. La qualità dei prodotti serviti a tavola è stata eccelsa, così come il servizio degli impeccabili addetti ai lavori.

La cucina e la scelta dei vini è di alto livello.
Nota di merito sicuramente il personale, sempre garbati, gentili e soprattutto competenti.
Non capita spesso di trovare uno staff così professionale, che da anni è sempre lo stesso, aspetto che garantisce un'attenzione particolare soprattutto sulla clientela più affezionata.

Posso dirvi che abbiamo trovato una stanza con bagno fornita di vasca abbastanza grande con la possibilità di essere utilizzata anche come semplice doccia.                    Il letto era composto da due materassi separati di una piazza e mezza l'una . La stanza è fornita di un balcone abbastanza grande da cui gustarsi il panorama circostante. Abbiamo potuto apprezzare l'ottima cucina serale con pochi ma selezionati menu' di carne e pesce tutto davvero buono. In un altro ambiente ci è stata servita la colazione ma dopo la cena della sera prima ed avendo visitato numerosi alberghi similari ci aspettavamo qualcosa in più ...comunque colazione nella media....di ottimo potrei consigliarvi in particolare le confetture .  Per ciò che concerne la Spa posso sottolinearvi che la massaggiatrice che ci ha trattato esegue  trattamenti  energici e quindi essendo una cosa soggettiva ci tengo a riportarvelo. Nella SPA vi è una sala se non ricordo male si chiama Bagno alle Erbe che a mio avviso era troppo illuminata quindi faceva perdere in parte l'effetto relax degli ambienti . Nella sala idromassaggio vi erano 2 candlieri con sei candele crea ambiente che son rimaste tutta la serata spente ...peccato ! Comunque mi auguro di potervi esser stato utile e

Camere spaziose, curate, con grande balcone vivibile. Bagno spazioso con ogni confort.
Ristorante interno, buono con piatti semplici ma ben eseguiti della tradizione pugliese. 
Bene attrezzati per congressi e convention.
Nota dolente e imperdonabile per una struttura di questo livello: abbiamo soggiornato per tre notti a meta' novembre e l'impianto di riscaldmento nelle camere era spento/guasto, ragion per cui abbiamo patito il freddo, capisco che possa accadere, ma comunque rimane imperdonabile. Peccato.

06,"Alles ganz ok, TUI-Werbung aber irreführend","Wir haben 10 Tage Anfang November in der Tenuta Moreno über TUI gebucht. TUI bewirbt das Hotel als eine Art Öko-Hotel. Dem muss ganz klar widersprochen werden. (Nein, die Möbel sind nicht aus Vollholz, autofreier Tourismus geht dort am allerwenigsten, das Essen stammt überwiegend nicht von der Tenuta selbst...) Es waren nur wenige Gäste dort. Unser Zimmer war geräumig und schön, das Bad zweckmäßig und sauber. Das Hotel erlebten wir sehr ruhig. Das (meist ausschließlich italienischsprachige) Personal war durchweg in einer unpersönlichen Art freundlich, aber nur teilweise um Problemlösungen bemüht. Hinweise auf und Erklärungen zu den Angeboten des Hotels kamen nur auf Nachfragen, Ausflugs- und Unternehmungs-Tips überhaupt nicht (bis auf ein paar mehr oder weniger zufällig vorhandene Prospekte). Die meisten angekündigten Einrichtungen wie Pool, Bar und Nudelkurse für die Gäste usw. waren außer Betrieb. In der Umgebung ist - nichts. Beim Versuch, in den Feldern um das Hotel zu wandern, wurden wir von einer Meute von 6 großen Hunden verfolgt. An den Wochenenden wurde in der Nähe von früh bis spät geschossen (Jagdgesellschaften?). Ein größerer Weg nach Mesagne (der einzige, den man ohne Hilfe findet) geht an der belebten Schnellstraße nach Taranto entlang. Unglaublich viel Müll in der Landschaft. Ohne Auto kann man praktisch nichts machen. 
Das Essen fanden wir bis auf überwiegend ungenießbare Desserts und nicht wirklich schmackhaftes (Öko-?)Gartengemüse ok, aber in keiner Weise besonders. Frühstück war reichlich und gut, mit frisch gepresstem Orangensaft, Focaccia und Kuchen als Specials. Trotz mangelnder Fremdsprachenkenntnisse waren die Kellner aber immer gut gelaunt, freundlich und aufmerksam. Kurz: Ein sehr ruhiger und durchweg angenehmer Ausgangsort für Autofahrten in die sehr interessante weitere Umgebung, aber kein Öko-Hotel mit lokalem Angebot.",3,2012,11,26

06,Ein wunderschönes Hotel mit ausgezeichneter Betreuung,"Wir haben eine Woche im September 2012 in diesem Hotel verbracht. Die uns bekannt gewordenen Empfehlungen sind bei weitem übertroffen worden. Rezeption und Gästebetreuung gingen auf alle unsere Wünsche und Bedürfnisse freundlichst ein. Der Service im ganzen Hotel war hervorragend. Unsere Aufenthalte im Restaurant und in der Bar haben wir genossen. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Auch hier haben wir uns wohlgefühlt. Auch die Außenanlagen (Pool, Wellnessbereich und Sportstätten) haben uns gut gefallen. Das Hotel eignet sich hervorragend als Ausgangspunkt zur Erkundung von Apulien. Die Abgeschiedenheit des Hotels - entfernt von allem touristischen Trubel - trägt zum angenehmen Aufenthalt wesentlich bei.  Jutta S.",5,2012,09,23
06,Einer unserer schönsten Urlaube,"Wir waren im Juli zwei Wochen in der Tenuta Morena und waren begeistert. Hier stimmte einfach alles: eine wunderschöne gepflegte und großzügige Anlage, schöne Zimmer, netter und aufmerksamer Service und eine herausragende Küche. 

In den beiden Wochen konnten wir wunderbar entspannen. Dazu lädt der große Pool geradezu ein. Was uns besonders gefallen hat: Das andernorts übliche Liegen reservieren ist hier völlig unbekannt - und auch unnötig. Denn zu jeder Zeit haben wir immer ein schönes schattiges Plätzchen gefunden. Dazu gab es auch noch kostenlos Handtücher. 

Sehr genossen haben wir auch die Küche. Ein großes Frühstücksbuffet mit herzhaften und süßen Leckereien war für uns ein gelungener Start in den Tag. Abends gab es dann vier Gänge: Zuerst ein großes Antipasti-Buffet, dann die Auswahl aus vier Nudelgerichten, danach die Auswahl aus zwei Fleisch- und zwei Fischgerichten und schließlich noch ein Dessertbuffet. Alles war von ausgezeichneter Qualität und sehr lecker. Verwendet werden übrigens Produkte aus der Region und zum Teil aus eigenem Anbau.

Besonders hervorheben möchte ich auch noch den Einsatz von Mirella, die für die deutschsprachigen Gäste Ansprechpartnerin ist. Sie hat sich wirklich ausgezeichnet um alles gekümmert und auch Sonderwünsche immer bestens erfüllt. Vielen Dank dafür.

Toll war übrigens auch der Pasta-Kochkurs sowie die Weinprobe im benachbarten Weingut. 

Wichtig zu wissen allerdings: Die Tenuta Moreno liegt ein wenigt abseits, sodass ein Mietwagen erforderlich ist. Mobil kann man dann die nähere und weitere Umgebung wunderbar erkunden. Wir haben wirklich sehr viele Ausflüge gemacht und sind begeistert von Apulien. Gute Tipps zu Ausflügen gibt es ebenfalls von Mirella.",5,2012,09,23
06,"Una certezza, sempre","Ci vado da anni, e ci ho trascorso anche un po' di vacanza con moglie e cagnetto. ci sono tornato dopo circa tre anni, e se prima era già un piacere, ora è ancora meglio. Stanze rifatte, giardini più curati, la solita piacevole cordialità nella giusta misura. Pulizia perfetta, terrazzini (finalmente) protetti da zanzariera e , dotati di divanetti in pietra (belli e funzionali) e piscina migliorata nel verde intorno e nel servizi.
Senza quella formalità che potrebbe caratterizzare una struttura di questo genere. Ristorante con qualità dei cibi (e dei vini) ineccepibile, ancora migliorabile in qualche dettaglio.
Buffet colazione eccellente, con sezione ""salata"" ottimamente dotata, con un prosciutto crudo che neanche a Parma.....prezzo, in proporzione al tutto, molto contenuto. Rapporto Qualità/prezzo notevole.",5,2012,09,13
06,ein wirklich ausgezeichnetes Hotel,"Im Sommer 2012 haben wir unseren Urlaub im Viverde Hotel Tenuta Moreno (Apulien) verbracht. Wer Ruhe und Entspannung sucht, erstklassige Küche genießen und dazu einen hervorragenden Service geliefert haben möchte, der ist hier genau richtig! Keine angrenzenden Hotelburgen, keine nervenden Dauer-Animationprograme, dafür ringsherum Olivenbäume und Weinhänge und wirklich viel Platz zum Erholen. Die Zimmer waren geräumig und das Personal sehr zuvorkommend. An dieser Stelle ein besonderer Dank an das Personal und an die hoteleigene Guest-Managerin Mirella, welche unsere Fragen, Wünsche und Anliegen immer bestens geregelt hat. Ein Hochgenuss ist das Frühstück und das Abendessen auf der großzügigen und sehr stilvoll eingerichteten Terrasse am Orangenhain. Das Angebot der Speisen ist kaum zu toppen. Landestypische Küche hervorragend zubereitet, alles ausreichend vorhanden und keine Warteschlangen am Buffet der Vor- und Nachspeisen. Alles geht sehr entspannt zu. An der großzügigen Poollandschaft sind Handtücher und Liegen kostenlos ausreichend vorhanden.
Den vom Hotel organisierten Pasta-Kochkurs sollte man nicht versäumen, er ist ein Erlebnis, ebenso der angebotene Pizzica-Tanzkurs (1 Stunde) und die Tour zum benachbarten Weingut. Bei einem Aufenthalt von 14 Tagen lohnt sich ein Mietwagen, um damit die Umgebung zu erkunden. 
Das Viverde Hotel Tenuta Moreno ist wirklich zu empfehlen. Wir haben hier einen der schönsten Urlaube verbringen dürfen.",5,2012,09,10
06,Rilassarsi viziati dalla buona tavola,"Siamo tornato in questa stupenda masseria dopo circa un anno ed ancora una volta le aspettative non sono state disattese. La struttura, i servizi, la cortesia del personale e soprattutto la cucina con gli antipasti e colazione a buffet sono stati semplicemente perfetti. La cena di Ferragosto anche questo anno ci e' piaciuta tanto, si e' vero qualche ospite avrebbe bisogno du un po' di buona educazione ma ciò non dipende assolutamente dalla struttura ricettiva. Secondo noi 50 eur sono spese benissimo, vista la location, la quantità e varietà della selezione offerta. Questo anno poi abbiamo visitato l'orto biologico, i profumi erano inebrianti. Insomma consiglio la tenuta a chi vuole trascorrere qualche giorno di relax lontano da spiaggie affollate. Noi ci ritorneremo sicuramente.",5,2012,08,30
06,Wunderschönes Hotel mit super Küche und deutscher Gästebetreuung,"Ich kann dieses Hotel mit besten Gewissen weiter empfehlen. Es eignet sich für Urlauber die dem Massentourismus entfliehen möchten. Wie schon so oft beschrieben handelt es sich um eine alte umgebaute Masseria mit wunderschönem Ambiente.
Die Tui hat dieses Hotel nicht umsonst in das neue Konzept der Viverde Hotels aufgenommen.
Hier wird auf die Umwelt geachtet und das Essen wird aus dem regionalen Anbau zubereitet.

Die Küche verdient ein super Lob ,daher empfehle ich unbedingt HP buchen. 
Wenn man abends auswärts essen möchte, kann man  mittags im Hotel essen. 

Die Zimmer sind sehr schön. Das Bad ist mit einer super großzügiger Regendusche ausgestattet. Duschgel/ Lotion und Shampoo gibt es reichlich natürlich auch ein Föhn.
Fernsehen ist auch auf dem Zimmer, 3 deutsche Programme (frei) oder auch PayTV zu buchbar
Internet ist umsonst im Hotel. Man kann sich an der Rezeption einen Schlüssel fürs mobile Internet holen.

Das Hotel liegt etwas ländlich, das heißt man braucht auf jeden Fall ein Mietauto.
 
Mirella (die Gästebetreuerin) ist die Perle des Hauses. Ich habe eine so individuelle Gästebetreuung noch in keinem anderen Hotel angetroffen. Sie verdient ein dickes Lob, da sie Ihre Arbeit mit Leidenschaft macht. :-) übrigens nicht nur Ansprechpartnerin für deutschsprachige Gäste.
Die Gästestruktur ist gemischt. Im August waren Deutsche, Italiener und Belgier usw. dort.
Kinder sind dort auch willkommen, einige riesige Poolanlage umrahmt von einen wunderschönen Olivenhain lädt zum relaxen ein.

Ausflüge nach Alberobello, Ostuni und viele andere schöne Orte sollte man unbedingt machen.

Ich kann nicht verstehen dass es einige Negativbewertungen von Italienern gibt. Ich glaube dass in diesem Hotel jeder Gast mit der gleichen Höflichkeit behandelt wird.

L'arrivo in albergo è stato accogliente, il personale disponibile e discreto. Per quanto riguarda la ristorazione.... non ho mai mangiato così bene!! La colazione offre e soddisfa ogni genere di palato, e la cena è a dir poco sublime; le parole per descriverla: semplice e delicata!! Vogliamo parlare del centro benessere?? Entrare nel centro significa dimenticare la vita reale per abbandonarsi completamente alle cure delle massaggiatrici che ti accompagnano per tutto il percorso hammam cullandoti e viziandoti!! La piscina immersa nell'uliveto rende il luogo completo di ogni comfort e servizi.
Consiglio questo luogo soprattutto a chi ha voglia di staccare dalla vita stressante e lavorativa di tutti giorni.",5,2012,08,28

Besonders hilfreich waren die Tipps zum Erkunden der wunderschönen Landschaft in der Umgebung. Das Ambiente der Anlage ist herrlich romantisch, Orangen- und Olivenbäume überall!

la tenuta a tutti gli effetti e' in resort eccezionale dotato di ogni confort .
la cucina e' ottima, l'ambiente internazionale, le attrezzature sportive complete la location assicura un venticello costante e piacevole
se un osservazione e' da fare riguarda le indicazioni stradali che non sono sufficienti o adeguate per un turista che per la prima volta si reca alla tenuta ( per fortuna che c'e' il tom tom ! ).
complimenti all'imprenditore che e' riuscito a realizzare e gestisce con tanta cura ed attenzione il complesso

Accoglienza impeccabile, le ragazze del centro benessere davvero deliziose e per coronare questa esperienza la CENA...un gioco di luci e candele creavano un' atmosfera davvero speciale.
Che dire???!!!Un'oasi lontana dal CAOS.",5,2012,08,25
06,Un discreto 3 stelle,"La struttura é bella, la piscina é grande e le aree comuni sono davvero spaziose, ma purtroppo le si deve condividere con i ricevimenti. La seconda mattina di soggiorno ho dovuto abbandonare il mio posto in piscina per permettere l'allestimento di un banchetto matrimoniale. Purtroppo in piscina non c'é alcun tipo di controllo per cui i ragazzi si tuffano liberamente e gridano disturbando chi vuole semplicemente riposarsi. A dire il vero non ho individuato neanche il ""bagnino"" che penso sia obbligatorio in un luogo del genere. Non é richiesto l'uso della cuffia né tantomeno l'obbligo della doccia prima di entrare in piscina a discapito dell'igiene.
In camera le lenzuola erano macchiate ed il dispenser del sapone vuoto. L'areatore del bagno rotto. Il personale non sempre é educato e spesso borbotta e parla fra i denti pensando che non li si veda o senta. Ho partecipato ad un buffet la sera di ferragosto molto costoso ma poco in linea con le aspettative. Cibo di qualità ma insufficiente come quantità e senza alcun tipo di controllo sulle grandi quantità di cibo rimaste sui tavoli degli incivili ospiti. Altri ospiti come me si sono lamentati del costo eccessivo e del pessimo servizio della serata. Sinceramente il giudizio globale non sarebbe stato negativo se l'albergo non fosse classificato come un quattro stelle dal prezzo tutt'altro che competitivo. Purtroppo sono rimasto molto deluso.",2,2012,08,22
06,Non all'altezza di un 4 stelle,"Sono in questa struttura veramente bella, piena di verde, olivi secolari, camere ampie, ma....c'è qualcosa che non quadra. Effettivamente, il personale, a richiesta, risponde con la cortesia sufficiente a non lasciarti insoddisfatto ma il tutto senza premura, il bar della piscina grande è sporco ed il personale, ragazzi di non più di vent'anni, è ""scocciato"", servono toast e panini dopo un'ora e 15' dall'ordinazione perchè attendono i piatti freddi dal ristorante!, il caffè viene fatto con cialde ( non c'è la macchina espresso che dovrebbe avere ) il bancone è pieno di briciole, i bagni sono tappati. Meglio la ragazza, veramente carina e cortese, del bar della piscina piccola.
La cena: antipasti a € 15,00, primi da € 14,00 ( porzioni da nouvelle couisine ), secondi da € 18,00, in sostanza oltre € 50,00, ma niente di che! Senza contare acqua, vino ed altro.
Aria condizionata non regolabile in camera, dovrebbero avvisare dell'impossibilità allo spegnimento, perchè riparte automaticamente dopo un minuto...e già la cervicale inizia a farsi sentire.
La lingua primaria è il TEDESCO, da non credere, tutto è scritto prima in tedesco, poi in inglese e poi in italiano!
Ci tornerei? No, preferirei una camera più piccola ma vorrei sentirmi a mio agio.
Il consiglio che darei alla proprietà : migliorare La selezione del personale, istruire lo stesso ad un approccio con il cliente più vero. Ma forse questo non interessa, ci sono i tedeschi ed i russi che non vi badano!!!!
",3,2012,08,19
06,"Bellissima la struttura, pessimo il servizio","Ho soggiornato in albergo per circa una settimana ed ho trovato numerosi difetti soprattutto in relazione al prezzo delle camere richiesto: 
1) personale molto poco educato( eccetto le donne delle pulizie che sono le uniche ad avere educazione) 
2) disorganizzazione totale, la cena di Ferragosto é stato l'apice di essa. Il prezzo di € 50( per gli ospiti dell'albergo, altrimenti sarebbe stato ancora più alto)è stato veramente esagerato in relazione alla cena offerta ad un buffet che, dopo essere stato svuotato da orde di vandali affamati, ha fatto restare a pancia vuota chi, educatamente, tentava di rispettare il proprio turno. Pessimo lo spettacolino offerto nel post cena da una combriccola di ragazzini che, loro malgrado, hanno tentato invano di offrire uno spettacolo decoroso. 
3) Assolutamente sprovvisti di alimenti per celiaci, essendo io celiaca ho trovato numerose difficoltà. È la prima volta che mi capita una situazione di questo tipo in un albergo le cui stelle credo siano state aggiunte a scopo puramente decorativo. 
4)camere non altezza di un quattro stelle
5)buffet a colazione, pranzo e cena pieno di mosche svolazzanti che passeggiano sugli alimenti. Per ordinare qualcosa al tavolo è necessario chiamare più volte i camerieri che chiacchierano tra loro del più e del meno invece di preoccuparsi delle esigenze degli ospiti. 
6)piscina priva di un bagnino che disciplini l'ordine per cui vi regna l'anarchia più totale. Ognuno fa ciò che vuole. Se si desidera qualcosa in piscina è necessario andare alla ricerca di qualcuno, sperare di trovarlo al fantomatico bar collocato in piscina ma non ci si aspetti che un caffè magari ti possa essere portato mentre si è comodamente sdraiati sul lettino, è una fantastica utopia. 
7) Le bocchette dell'idromassaggio in piscina non funzionano e spesso il fondo è pieno di sabbia poiché non è pulita adeguatamente da chi dovrebbe essere preposto a farlo. 
8)aria condizionata non regolabile in autonomia in camera per cui se non ci si reca in reception a chiedere un adeguata temperatura si rischia di morire assiderati per il freddo o d'asfissia per il caldo. 
9) Ultima cosa ma non per importanza da segnalare il tv a tubo catodico in camera stile "" ante guerram"" e disparità di trattamento tra gli stranieri e gli italiani, fin dall'accoglienza, persino le indicazioni sono solo in tedesco a causa di una convenzione che l'albergo ha con un tour operator tedesco che prevede una serie di servizi forniti esclusivamente agli ospiti tedeschi. Assurdo!

06,ottimo ristorante,"Ho avuto l'occasione di essere invitato ad un matrimonio di un amico,ottimo ristorante,cibo di qualità,personale molto distinto e cordiale.Il posto è bellissimo pieno di verde,bella anche la piscina.Ottimo per chi vuole rilassarsi dallo stress quotidiano.",5,2012,08,16
06,Relax e posizione strategica,"Frequento questo hotel sin dalla sua apertura e nonostante sia passati oltre 10 anni, rimane sempre molto elevato lo standard ed il livello di manutenzione. La tenuta è molto estesa e con aree verdi molto curate con prato all'inglese, ulivi secolari e palmizi. La sua posizione nelle campagne fra Latiano e Mesagne costituisce la base perfetta per visitare Ostuni, Ceglie Messapica, Erchie, Cisternino, Martina Franca e Grottaglie. La dislocazione a metà strada fra l'adriatico e lo jonio consente di scegliere l'eventuale spiaggia secondo la ventosità della giornata. La struttura è dotata di una bellissima piscina immersa nel verde e con bar dedicato, campi da tennis, campo di calcio e SPA. Il wi-fi è presente in tutto l'hotel ad eccezione della piscina. Il segnale della telefonia cellulare è scarso. La colazione, che d'estate è servita sotto la veranda nell'aranceto, è di alto livello e con una grande varietà dolce e salata. La cucina del ristorante è di buon livello e con prezzi onesti. L'albergo nei periodi estivi è frequentato sopratutto da stranieri ed è molto organizzato per eventi, meetings e congressi anche molto grandi. Le camere sono grandi e con un enorme letto king size, frigo bar, cassaforte, sky, climatizzazione efficiente ma non molto pratica nella gestione. Il bagno è grande, confortevole e con buona dotazione. Unica nota negativa (malgrado l'elevato livello di pulizia ed igiene) è la difficoltà da parte della direzione nel debellare la fastidiosa presenza di mosche che a volte diventa insopportabile. Se decidete di non cenare in hotel, vi consiglio ""Il Brigantino"" ristorante di pesce a San Michele Salentino, ""La locanda di nonna Mena"" piccolissima trattoria salentina a San vito dei Normanni, ""Acquasale"" ristorante charmante di pesce ad Ostuni o una delle tante ""macellerie con fornello"" di Cisternino dove gustare ottime specialità di carne all'aperto nei vicoli del centro storico.

Il buffet di secondi con angolo friggitora e burbeque non ci ha soddisfatto innanzitutto per l'accalco degli ospiti che si è creato a ridosso delle postazioni, poi il cibo non è bastato per tutti infatti mia moglie non ha avuto accesso ai gamberoni di Gallipoli ed ai turcinieddrhi io invece ho potuto provare più o meno tutto e devo dire che nulla era cotto a dovere. Che peccato ma  se per un matrimonio di circa 100 ospiti ci si approccia a servizi di questo tipo bisogna sapere che le aspettative dei clienti sono alte e non si può sbagliare, anche se comprendo le difficoltà degli chef a gestire tutti quei clienti affamati.

06,Schöne umgebaute Masseria,"Vom Personal sprechen zwei bis drei deutsch und ein paar sprechen noch englisch, auch einwenig französisch. Ansonten ist die Hauptsprache natürlich italienisch. Das Personal war eigentlich immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Auch die Kellner beim Abendessen waren immer sehr bemüht.
 Es waren täglich eine Hochzeit, die wirklich gar nicht gestört haben. Abends war trotzdem das komblette Personal für uns da und vernachläßigte uns nicht. 
Nur gelegentlich war abends mal Musik zu hören, was aber auch nicht lange dauerte. Da die Hotelanlage doch sehr weitläufig ist, wurden die Veranstaltungen in einem seperaten Teil des Hotels abehalten.
Es wurde morgens ein kontinentales Frühstück am schönen Oranbenbaumgarten angeboten. Es wurde ein frisch gepresster Orangensaft und sehr leckerer Cappuccino angeboten. Außerdem gab es noch Müsli, verschiedene Weißbrote, frisches Obst, Schinken, Käse, Marmelade, Honig, Butter, Tee sowie verschieden Crossants mit Schokoladen und Marmeladenfüllung (immer sehr lecker) und verschiendene Süßigkeiten. Zum täglich wechselnden Abendessen gab es ein Antipastibuffet und es standen immer drei bis vier Vorspeisen (meistens immer leckere Pasta mit tollen Soßen) zur Auswahl . Das Hauptgericht konnte man meistens zwischen drei bis vier Fisch- und Fleischgerichte wählen. Zum Abschluß gab es immer noch ein süßer Dessert und Obst vom Buffet.
 Natürlich durfte ein leckerer Wein aus der sehr umfangreichen Weinkarte nicht fehlen.
 Zwei mal wurde am schönen Steinpool gegrillt mit Kerzenschein und aufgestellten Lichtern, alles sehr romantisch. 
Uns hatte es immer sehr lecker geschmeckt.
Die Zimmer waren großzügig und schön eingerichtet. Wir hatten einen großen Balkon mit zwei Liegen, einen Tisch und zwei Stühle und es war immer noch Platz.. Safe gab es kostenlos im Zimmer.

06,splendido,"Io e mio marito abbiamo avuto modo di passare una giornata nella Spa (ottima), festeggiare il nostro matrimonio presso il Ristorante (eccellente) e di pernottare una notte  presso l'hotel (ottimo).
TUTTI i servizi sono impeccabili!!! Personale gentile, disponibile, educato. Pulizia indescrivibile! DAVVERO CONSIGLIATO!!!!!",5,2011,07,17
06,Ottimo albergo con Spa all'uscita di Latiano Est,"Ho trovato questo albergo tramite internet ed all'arrivo mi sono accorto che era un Manor stile inglese. Veramente suggestivo e scenografico. Camera Spaziosa pulita, colazione abbondante. Nulla da Eccepire. Il costo 100,00€. Seguire con attenzione le frecce indicatorie quando si entra perchè potrebbe sembrare un labirinto. Non proprio semplice da individuare.",4,2011,04,07
06,"hotel di charme, spazioso, immerso nel verde, informale,rilassante","Sono stato con la famiglia per due volte, sempre nel mese di agosto, e con soddisfazione. Le camere sono spaziose e confortevoli, la pulizia buona, la piscina ampia e ben disposta, quasi non si rimpiange la spiaggia con il mare, la cucina è eccellente, da non perdere i pasti all'aranceto, il personale è efficiente e affabile. Uniche note dolenti sono la quantità di mosche in camera- l'hotel è in aperta campagna- la mancanza della palestra e la lontananza dai centri abitati, va bene per rilassarsi qualche giorno. I prezzi in agosto non sono economici ma la struttura ed i servizi sono quasi da 5 stelle, quindi va bene cosi. Lo consiglio senza meno, è ottimo.",4,2011,01,13
06,"Una tenuta molto bella,curata un oasi di pace","La tenuta è molto grande e accogliente, quando arrivate c'è una persona che vi accoglie al parcheggio e vi indica dove andare .La hall è grande e accogliente, gli addetti alla reception molto disponibili.Le camere sono ampie un pò spartane e con un letto GIGANTESCO.Bello anche il bagno con shampoo e bagnoschiuma e ciabatte.
Colazione di ottima qualità e di grandissima varietà, ho perso il conto dei dolci che trovate, con un prosciutto buonissimo e pane caldo!
Un'altra cosa sorprendente è il grandissimo numero di persone che puliscono tutte le zone comuni, con una cura maniacale...eccezionale veramente.
super consigliato.",4,2010,10,02
06,Meraviglioso,"Sono stata in questa struttura e posso assicurare il suo splendore, noi siamo una famiglia di 4 persone di cui un bimbo di 8 anni ed un ragazzo di 20, per loro è stato bello ma non eccessivamente in quanto per i bimbi non c'è animazione se vuoi divertirti la sera sopratutto per i ragazzi c'è Mesagne dove c'è vita. Comunque il personale è decisamente fantastico e molto preparato, disponibili al massimo, anzi colgo l'occasione per salutarli con un grasso abbraccio. Il ristorante è favoloso di mangia benissimo e romantico. L'ubicazione secondo me è positiva perchè puoi raggiungere tranquillamente le varie spiagge dell'Adriatico e dello Jonio.
Tutto ciò che si vede sul sito rispecchia ogni singola parola e foto... Meraviglioso. Ogni sera l'albergo organizzava serata a tema con molta raffinatezza e precisione. Lo consiglio appassionatamente!!!!!",5,2010,08,26
06,molto bello,"bellissimo per soggiornare per piacere e conoscere la puglia o per lavoro. ottima la cucina, bellissimi i colori. la colazione d'estate all'aranceto è di sicuro da provare.",5,2009,12,17
06,rundherum verwöhnt,"ich weiß nicht, was man in diesem Hotel noch vermißen könnte. 
Zimmer: Sauber und geräumig.
Anlage: Riesig, gepflegt, Pool riesen groß. 
Essen: Immer gut, frisch und abwechslungreich (wir waren 10 Tage dort).
Personal:Sehr professionell, spricht mehrere Sprachen, sehr hilfsbereit.
Hochzeiten und Kongresse: Stören meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nicht und das Personal vernachläßigt deswegen die Halbpension Gäste gar nicht., ganz im Gegenteil, sie bemühen sich umso mehr.
Lage: super für Ausflüge, aber Apulien hat so viel zu bieten, so daß man sich vorher darüber Gedanke machen sollte, was man sehen möchte und eine Auswahl treffen. Toll ist auch, das das Hotel nicht weit weg vom Flughafen Brindisi liegt. 
Auto: Unbedingt notwendig!
Ich würde jederzeit wieder zurück. davor mußte ich aber zuerst die 3 Kilos abspecken, die ich dort zugelegt habe!",5,2009,06,15
06,Bella struttura,"Hotel molto bello pero lontano sia dal mare che dalle attrazioni turistiche della puglia.
Le camere sono spaziosi e confortevoli, con servizi veramente molto curati la struttura ha anche una piscina ed un campo da tennis ed un ristorante con cucina molto ricercata (e un po' cara).
La struttura si trova in una zona abbastanza isolata ma vicino allo svincolo della ss7 anche se la strada per raggiungerlo non è illuminata ma e ben segnalata.
Lo consiglio sicuramente per l'ospitalità e la qualit della struttura meno per la posizione.",4,2009,01,14
06,Struttula complessa ma completa,"Struttura molto accogliente nonostante la complessita'. Ben disposta con la suddivisione tra ""zona giorno"" e camere, che sono ubicate in una area del complesso dedicata. Il Ristorante (estivo, all'aperto nella zona ""aranceto"") ha menu' ricercato, ma molto contenuto: si consiglia il buffet antipasti per quantità / qualità / costo. Il Grand Hotel Tenuta Moreno è sicuramente consigliabile, ma con 2 avvertenze: 1.Non è vicino al mare nè alle principali località turistiche pugliesi (in auto: Alberobello - Grotte di Castellana - Polignano a circa 1,5 h; Ostuni - Lecce - Zoo Safari circa 1 ora... per citare le più vicine) ma è a 20 minuti dall'Aeroporto di Brindisi e non è necessario lasciare il complesso residenziale per godersi una vacanza in pieno relax; 2.Esiste anche una Sala Ricevimenti per banchetti nuziali, ed a volte ci si interseca con gli invitati che utilizzano parte della struttura per buffet o cocktail di benvenuto.",4,2008,08,03
