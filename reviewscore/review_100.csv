100,Quirky hotel,"Stayed here with my daughter and my good friend and her daughter 
It’s a great hotel, rooms are quirky and individual, not one of those hotels with a long corridor with rooms off it and slamming doors all night!
The location is great, we walked mostly to all attractions, occasionally got the tram (5 mins away) for a few stops 
The beds and pillows were the best we have ever had in a hotel, fantastic quality 
All in all we had the best time in Amsterdam and this hotel made our girls trip special",5,2024,09,28
100,Hotel Arena,This is a beautiful hotel. Slightly on the outskirts of Central Amsterdam but good tram links. A short walk through the park and you can get the number 14 straight to Central. It is set in a beautiful park and has a really lovely bar to chill out in. The room was spacious and unique.,5,2024,09,22
100,Very chemical smell in room and stains,"Very chemical smell in the room. 
We got instant headache and start coughing. 
Was so bad we couldn’t stay in the hotel. There were also some stains next to the bed on the carpet. 

On explaining that we made a deal based on the advertisement, they did not mention using so much chemicals 
That it can make people feel sick and can not stay there. 
Its not our fault, but it might have been wise to mentioning it for clients. 
Now they also did not want to give back money for the first day. 
This is an on going situation.
Very unpleasant experience",1,2024,08,30
100,"Good hotel, good location, I recommend","Good size room, comfortable beds, nice size bathroom and shower, decent toiletries. 2 minutes walk from the station. Friendly staff and good breakfast. Checkout time is 12pm, which is good. Our room was ready when we arrived at 11.30am. I recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,30
100,seriously let down after a good start,"Management (MGMT) takes no responsibility for their staff's actions. Their policies encourages thievery by the staff, would not feel comfortable staying here again.

On the last day of my stay, I forgot my toiletry case (containing electric razer, sonic toothbrush, products, ...). I notified the front desk staff the same evening and they said they would look into it. I called back the next day, they said the contact person was gone and they would follow up. It took more than a week and repeat calls to hear from MGMT. In the meanwhile, no one from house keeping turned in the missing items to lost and found.
It's pretty clear the cleaning staff stole the items, otherwise they would have just said they threw them away. MGMT only states that they take no responsibility for items not inside the room vault, thinks I should have stored everything in the room vault. But seriously, do I have to lock up my suits, glasses, toothbrush and razor too, every time house keeping comes by?",2,2024,08,05
100,"Terrible customer service at the arena, rooms not checked before keys handed out to new customers ","Terrible customer service and rude staff,rooms not checked before keys handed out, our fridge didn't work,safe didn't work,spongy floor outside our toilet and shower room,light hanging from wires from ceiling, unclean seating outside room  ",1,2024,07,29
100,The rooms are sub-par,"This hotel is situated in a quaint old hospital with beautiful grounds and near public transit. The courtyard and patio are wonderful places to sit and enjoy the view. The restaurant food is good but expensive. The hotel service is good but not great. However, the quality of the rooms is sub-par. The beds are at best a double and the mattresses are covered with a foam topper that makes you want to roll out of bed. There is only one small window in the room and the paint/decorations are poor.",3,2024,06,10
100,Highest city tax in Europe.,"The Arena Hotel is very nice, odd room with steep steps to the bed. Lovely park setting but if your going into the centre it's a long 45 - 50min walk.. Taxi to central station €20.00. REMEMBER Amsterdam now has the highest city tax each night in Europe. 12.5% on top of room rate. So a standard room is €30.00 a night extra.",4,2024,05,19
100,Excellent restaurant but the hotel staff are clueless...,"Excellent restaurant but the hotel staff are clueless. Booked me into a wrong room, told me breakfast not included when it was, double charged me both the deposit and then the full bill as well and still not refunded. A bit of a walk from any tram or subway and in the suburbs.",3,2024,05,18
100,Highly Recommend ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay at this hotel. The charm and character of the hotel and the picturesque park adjacent to it were highlights and a great fit for our interest in visiting this great city. We had no issues with our room , the hotel staff, or the onsite restaurant.  Any requests we had were fulfilled immediately. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we visit Amsterdam.",5,2024,05,16
100,"An asset to Amsterdam in a prime location, well worth a visit.",A hotel full of character and history. Located on the edge of the park with a lovely outside bar. The rooms are all different and very comfortable. We were lucky to be given a room in the bell tower in the eves which was quirky. The cocktails were well made and delicious a hotel I would highlight recommend.,5,2024,05,10
100,Smart hotel in lovely location.,"The location in Oosterpark is delightful and peaceful and tram stops to the centre are within a few minutes walk. In general, the public areas are rather grand. The bedrooms can be quite a walk from reception despite the availability of a lift. Our room was split level with a steepish spiral-type staircase to the bedroom area- not recommended for heavy drinkers or anyone with mobility issues. Large comfy bed and TV with a few English channels including BBC1 and 2. Very stylish shower room and toilet. Handy desk.
Shortcomings were an apparent lack of drawer space, no mirror near a power point and lack of a plug for the sink.
Staff at reception were very pleasant and helpful.
Overall, a good choice. Restaurant reviewed separately.",4,2024,05,08
100,Lovely hotel!,"This is a lovely hotel - friendly staff, clean rooms and all the standard amenities/toiletries provided including shampoo, conditioner, body wash & lotion, hairdryer, mini fridge, TV. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were quiet. The hotel has a lot of history, which you can feel both in your room and walking through it. We especially liked the individual luggage storage lockers which we used between checking out and flying home - these felt very secure and put our minds at ease.

The hotel is located right by a lovely green park, and is less than a 5 minute walk from a tram stop where you can easily travel to the city centre and all the tourist hotspots. You can also walk to several metro stations in under 10 minutes, opening up your transport options even more.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and consider coming back when I am next in Amsterdam.",4,2024,04,22
100,Fantastic hotel,Excellent hotel we loved our stay here.we had a room with upstairs mezzanine floor loads of room big comfortable bed .staff were friendly and helpful.Food was so good we ate in the hotel every evening beautiful restaurant full of plants.short walk to the tube two stops into the centre.would recommend to stay here,5,2024,04,21
100,Disappointing Service and Lack of Flexibility at Hotel Arena,"I recently had an unfortunate experience at Hotel Arena while attending a conference. Upon check-in, I realized I had mistakenly booked the wrong date through Expedia. It was an honest mistake—I had simply selected the wrong month.

Acting quickly, I contacted Expedia, who reached out to Hotel Arena on my behalf to request a change to the correct dates. Despite the straightforward nature of this error, the hotel was completely inflexible. They refused to adjust the booking date and did not offer any form of refund or discount. In fact, they increased the price by over €100 for the night I needed.

The staff's approach can only be described as rude and arrogant. Such customer service is not only disappointing but also detrimental to the reputation of Hotel Arena, especially for travellers relying on some degree of flexibility and understanding in such situations.

As a result, I had no choice but to book another hotel for my stay. I will be gifting the unused room for July to someone else, as it seems there is no other recourse. I would caution potential visitors to consider other accommodations where the service is more accommodating and the staff more professional.",1,2024,04,16
100,Perfect for a weekend in amsterdam,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, great parc, very relaxing. We had a great time. It was calm and clean. The park is awesome. You can walk or take the bus to the center. It is easy to reach. Lots of restaursnts nearby. Generally good vibe and recommend to stay",4,2024,03,31
100,Great couple weekend away!,"Overall, our stay at Arena Hotel was nice with a spacious & clean room! Bed was big and comfortable and the room had everything we needed albeit quite a small room. Also, the walls are extremely thin…can hear all conversations in rooms either side.

Location was great, 20-30 walk to centre or trams/trains were easy to access and use from the hotel. Also, not far from the airport which was a big plus. 

Downside was that the aircon wasn’t working and the room was absolutely boiling which did make it difficult to sleep at times. Also, the room isn’t restocked with water and you have to pay if you want anymore. 

Also, be aware on arrival you have to pay city tax and put a €50 a night deposit hold on your card.",5,2024,03,17
100,"Beautiful , friendly hotel","Such a beautiful hotel , 
Friendly staff on arrival and departure , bar staff was also friendly and assisted with questions , room was spacious and comfortable , best nights sleep in a long time , location was perfect and close to main attractions with trams close by , 10/10",5,2024,02,23
100,Fun and calm weekend with friends.,"Beautiful location. 
Incredible setting and top facilities. 
Stayed for a sunny weekend. Stunning decor, busy and lovely restaurant/bar - great options for breakfast 
Close enough to pop in to central and far away enough to enjoy the calm of the neighbourhood",5,2024,02,19
100,A good choice of hotel,"This lovely hotel used to be a psychiatric hospital mainly for women who weren't able to look after themselves. Don't worry it bears no resemblance to it's former usage, except maybe the impressive staircases. The rooms are quirky, with the large double bed situated on the mezzanine. If I have to be picky I would suggest handrails on the narrow spiral staircase. The breakfast gives you a good choice , we didn't use the restaurant. The hotel is situated a little way out of the city centre, but the nearby Tram No 19 will get you within walking distance. A good choice of hotel",4,2023,12,17
100,Lovely,"Highly enjoyed our stay! Room was pristine, had everything we needed and I loved the design and style. It was useful having drinks etc available at reception and even the grounds outside were lovely. ",5,2023,11,26
100,Wonderful long weekend,"Just got back from a wonderful long weekend in Amsterdam with my partner to celebrate his recent exam results and promotion. The Arena Hotel is a gorgeous hotel in a very picturesque location within Amsterdam Oost, with most attractions between 20-30 minutes walk away. Before our trip I was unsure what to expect of the hotel after reading some very dramatic negative reviews but this could not be farter from the truth of our experience at the Arena Hotel. The staff were all very welcoming and polite from check in to check out. The room was beautifully clean and very stylishly decorated and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of it!! We ate and drank in the restaurant and are very big fans of the Gin and tonic selection and the delicious Stake tartar! The addition of a ‘what to see in Amsterdam’ magazine in the room was greatly appreciated as it poured all day on Saturday and it gave us many ideas of places to visit and stay dry! 
Thank you Hotel Arena we would love to visit again soon! ",4,2023,11,20
100,Disgusting etiquette,"We where all very excited to arrive in Amsterdam and explore your beautiful country and enjoy a well deserved break however, from the very moment we arrived our rooms where not ready, however we checked in our bags in, in the lockers and set off to explore and take in the culture of the architecture. Upon return to our hotel we where shocked to learn one of our rooms had been cancelled? However we had booked and paid for two rooms in full- your staff managed to find another room however these rooms where substandard for such hotel and NOT what we had originally booked and paid for. 
Before we could check into our shoddy rooms we further learnt we where required to pay over 100€ in city tax and 300€ as a deposit? 
This has never been the case in any of our travels and utterly disgraceful we where not made aware of this prior to our stay. 
Trying to make the best of an already awful weekend away we continued with our ‘holiday’ and very much enjoyed the beauty of Amsterdam….. untill we checked out on Sunday.
Informed when handing back the room keys we owed a further 500€ for the additional room. 
We did not book or stay in an additional room, we booked and paid for two rooms and the insensitive behaviour of the staff to suggest we were somehow liable for a third room is unfathomable!
I would not recommend any one to stay at this hotel and I would advise the inadequate staff and procedures at this so called four star establishment are below the minimum of human etiquette and beyond the meaning of hospitality.",1,2023,11,12
100,Good place to stay,"All good in terms of restaurant personnel, we had one first day In job personnel at reception and still an extra charge of 131 euros on my card that need to be explained, hotel is in a nice location and and rooms are good ",5,2023,11,06
100,"Quiet, Comfortable, Accommodating","I wanted a quiet comfortable place to stay for a short visit to Amsterdam. This hotel is in a park, so has a lovely setting. The staff was helpful, the room was exactly as pictured on their website and spacious. It was a 15 minute walk  to some lovely restaurants (a helpful since for me since it was raining a couple nights) or a 30 minute walk to the museums.  If I knew I’d be walking the whole day, it was a 10 minute cab ride (Uber works, or the staff can call you a taxi). Breakfast was a healthy and large selection, and the coffee is freshly brewed (a machine you use).  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2023,10,26
100,Lovely hotel but lack of information regarding deposits and city tax,"Overall a nice stay. However, we weren’t notified prior to arriving that we had to pay city tax on top of a 50 Euro a night DEPOSIT after paying nearly £1100 to stay there.

So before we’d even checked in I was already nearly 400 euros out of pocket.

The stay itself was lovely and the actual hotel is stunning, but our room consisted of 2 single beds put together. 

Now I am currently chasing them for a return of the deposit that was unspent and I checked out nearly 3 weeks ago! They have emailed me with a receipt however the card details they have aren’t mine which is beginning to annoy me in trying to resolve this issue. ",4,2023,09,29
100,Ignorance Leading to a Grave Incident,"Our recent stay at Hotel Arena turned out to be one of the most disturbing experiences we've ever encountered. What my wife experienced due to the hotel staff's negligence left us both in shock, and the subsequent reaction from the management only added to our distress.

Before even arriving at the hotel, I had a taste of the inconsistencies that lay ahead. Upon finally securing a room with a bath after an upgrade, we were hopeful for a comfortable stay.
However, our hopes quickly dimmed when our room had no warm water. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the hotel offered us another ""upgraded"" room. But this room had a faulty A/C unit that dripped and disrupted our rest.

During a visit by technicians to address the A/C problem, one of them, without any warning or the decency of a knock, intruded into our bathroom where my wife was present. This blatant invasion of privacy is not only unprofessional but borders on harassment, leaving us horrified.

Rushing to the front desk to report this egregious behavior, we were met with nothing more than tepid apologies. The audacity of the management, attempting to dissuade us from going to the police, was a clear sign of their indifference to the gravity of the situation. Their primary concern, seemingly, was to brush the incident under the rug and move on.

Looking back, it’s clear that the root of our traumatic experience was the hotel's repeated ignorance:
1. Their failure to check basic amenities such as the availability of warm water.
2. Not ensuring that the second room was up to standard.
3. A profound lack of training and oversight of their staff, leading to the alarming bathroom incident.

Our departure was the final testament to their apathy. Their only inquiry? Whether we had involved the police. Their complete disregard for our emotional and psychological wellbeing was painfully apparent.",1,2023,09,20
100,Wedding night,"We booked the suite for 2 nights for our wedding. Such a lovely authentic & modern & relaxed location, super hospitality! Very friendly staff, willing to take an extra step for our stay. We let our parents also stay in the super comfy room, they loved it.",5,2023,09,12
100,"Brilliant location , pretty rooms , very friendly staff , would highly recommend this to all ages and groups of people ","Brilliant location , tidy and comfortable room would highly recommend , the Aircon was very welcome as we stayed during a mini heatwave , one point that would have made the experience better is someone should have showed us too our room , the site is huge and it took us a long time to find it . ",5,2023,09,11
100,Extremely Disappointing Stay - Terrible Service and Unhygienic Conditions,"I regret to say that my recent 5-night stay at Hotel Arena in Amsterdam was nothing short of a nightmare, marred by abysmal service and unacceptable housekeeping practices. I feel compelled to share my experience so that others may avoid the same ordeal.

Throughout our stay, not once did the housekeeping staff visit our room to clean it. We followed the hotel's instructions to place used towels and bathrobes on the floor, anticipating they would be replaced with fresh ones. However, to our astonishment, the cleaners simply hung the dirty and wet bathrobes back in the room. This lack of attention to cleanliness is inexcusable for a supposed premium hotel.

To make matters worse, when we requested new towels and a bathrobe, the hotel cleaner unceremoniously barged into our room at 11 PM without any prior warning. There was no doorbell ring or announcement of their arrival, despite it being blatantly obvious that we were inside. This invasion of privacy was both intrusive and uncomfortable.

We reached out to the hotel management to express our concerns about the lack of cleaning services during our entire stay. They assured us they would investigate the matter and provide a partial refund as a solution. However, more than 48 hours have passed since we checked out, and we haven't received a single communication from them. This complete lack of follow-up and accountability reflects the hotel's utter disregard for customer satisfaction.

Perhaps most concerning is the apparent absence of cleaning staff throughout the entire hotel. During our stay, we never once encountered a cleaner in the corridors or common areas. This neglect of basic hygiene standards is not only disappointing but also raises serious health concerns.

In summary, Hotel Arena in Amsterdam does not live up to its premium pricing. Their inability to provide essential cleaning services, coupled with a lack of responsiveness from management, is simply unacceptable. I strongly advise potential guests to reconsider staying here, as this establishment falls far short of the standards one would expect from a reputable hotel. It is clear that Hotel Arena prioritizes profit over the well-being and comfort of its guests.",1,2023,09,04
100,Don't buy any celebration or romantic package ,"We came for our anniversary, asked the staff before if they can do something nice in the roon,but they said that they are doing packages, so I bought the celebration package which was €40. Was supposed to include a Prosseco chocolate and room decorated with balloons. We got the prosseco but not the chocolate we had just 2-3 ballons. For €40 euro was expected a bit more, especially didn't get the full package but paid for a full package.
The room was nice, with double bed and a nice view.
Nice idea to have the bed separated upstairs. ",3,2023,09,04
100,Great stay,"We were nervous to book this hotel based on other reviews, and we shouldn’t have been. Our “Arena Suite” was large and architecturally interesting and we had no plumbing problems or issues with smells whatsoever during our stay. The park that the hotel is located in is gorgeous, wonderful for walking or exercising and also provides a beautiful setting for the hotel’s restaurant. The staff were always friendly and courteous. We had a few small issues (a bottle of wine was left in an ice bucket with no plate or towel while we were out of the room, which melted and flowed onto a table and rug; the light in the separate bathroom turned off after - literally - less than 15 seconds without motion; several calls down to the reception desk went unanswered), but the hot tub in our room and beautiful location made up for it. While the hotel isn’t located in the center of the action, we found that to be a plus and as people who like to walk and do so rather quickly, we never found it difficult to get into the center of the city. A note for travelers with disabilities or who have a difficult time moving luggage: while the front of the hotel is fully ramped, the material is slatted wood and it is difficult to roll luggage into the front of the hotel and up several ramps, and the main entrance to the hotel is a bit of a walk from the road.",5,2023,09,01
100,Excellent Hotel,Hotel Arena is certainly one of my favorite hotels and I love returning back every time I have a chance. It's very close to the main station so you can easily walk from there and it's also in very nice neighborhood with park right in front of the hotel.,5,2023,08,28
100,Hands down two thumbs up,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Our suite was lovely, only to be outdone by the service. All staff were apart of us having a great experience, from front desk to housekeeping to food service. And a special tip of the hat to Sara at the front desk who went out of her way to accommodate us, we very much appreciated her efforts.",5,2023,08,22
100,Nice hotel overlooking the park,"I stayed here for five nights in August 2023.
Not far from the centre of Amsterdam with good transport options - close to Metro/Tram, with on site car parking and bike rental.
The rooms with loft bed look good but are not very practical - the bathroom is on the lower level. I stayed in one and would not choose this room type again. The room lacked a USB socket (so bring chargers) and functioning fridge but was otherwise very spacious and comfortable.
The staff were very good and on check in I found a nice handwritten welcome note, a drink voucher and some free snacks in the room.
The bar/restaurant was fine (I ate there once for dinner). Better dining options can be found a short walk away through the park (Ask the staff for suggestions).
Overall a very nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay but better for couples than solo travellers.",4,2023,08,19
100,Wonderful unique stay,"My husband and I visited Hotel Arena years ago and decided to come back with our family. We absolutely adored our cozy 2-story room which was perfect for our family of 4. The location is lovely if you’re ok with being not-super central. For us it was perfect, we are not into the crowded center of town scene and it was easy enough to walk or tram everywhere. Having the Oosterpark just behind is a plus. I hope to come back again soon!",4,2023,08,10
100,Great place to stay.,"This is a well placed hotel with lovely setting in the park. The building is interesting with variable features, some a little tired, but overall very good. Staff were really very friendly and efficient, and reception helped with advice that made our 5days in the city easy to negotiate. We ate in the day a couple of times, and once in the evening. The fine dining evening experience was exceptional with a wonderful steak at the heart of it! 
    There was a down side however, and that was the room had an unpleasant drain smell ( Room 305) which, to be fair to trip advisor we had read before. After three days we found leaving the bath full of water overcame the problem! Whilst cleaning was only average and room service felt half hearted we were there to enjoy ourselves, and the positives far outweighed the negatives. We will go again I’m sure.",4,2023,08,09
100,Style with little substance,"I would like to begin with saying that this review or the hotel itself did not adversely effect our stay in Amsterdam, it was a perfect four day mini break.  The review is a reflection on a mediocre hotel masquerading as high end... its certainly got the looks of a top hotel, the location looking over a park is lovely and the proximity to the city centre is perfect.  The restaurant/bar is very trendy and the rooms are opulent, and spacious, although the suite we had wasn't designed very well (I'll touch on that later}.  The hotel and rooms were clean, when you enter, you feel the high price you pay is justified, it feels very top end and classy...  but feelings can change...  you can't have the looks without the personality and this is where Arena falls short, you can see by the décor, the style and the branding (which is on pretty much everything), Arena aspires to be so much, but alas I feel the aspirations are not going to be met unless they can make the place feel more welcoming.  The reception staff are  'cold', they made a bit of small talk when we arrived, but that was about it, its as if they feel the brand talks for itself and that would be enough, but I can assure you it is not.  As you leave and return from days out, the people on reception don't smile or greet you, as we checked out, we were not even asked how our stay was, not even a wish for a safe onward journey.  The staff in the bar area were more welcoming, although some days they'd walk passed you as if you were not there, leaving you waiting to place an order.  Now for the room, as I said, we had a suite, very big room, couch, dining table with four chairs and a spa bath, robes, slippers etc., all there.  It was clean and it was comfortable, however, given the huge space, the bed was crammed in a corner, and you couldn't walk around it without shuffling, and the wardrobe was less than a metre wide, no where near enough room to hang our clothes.  There was no kettle, there was a coffee machine which trickled out hot water, and no English tea bags, rosemary or earl grey, but not a straight forward normal tea...  hardly considering your customer/guest now is it?...  we found a local SPAR and bought what we needed.  We thought we'd have at least one breakfast at the hotel, for a whopping 22 Euros each, we were looking forward to something fantastic, well it wasn't...  some fruit, yogurt, muesli, artisan breads, meats, salmon, scrambled egg, pancakes and bacon was all that was on offer...  so for 44 Euros, my wife and I had some pancakes and a cup of tea, because that was all we liked from the what was on offer.   So, in summary, smart, clean trendy, great location but lacks character, warmth and welcome.",3,2023,08,09
100,Relaxing stay in busy city,Ideal of you want to escape from the hectic city centre. Enjoyed our stay. Rooms are nice and clean. And the hotel has a nice atmosphere. Would also recommend the hotel-restaurant. Staff is helpfull and friendly.,5,2023,08,07
100,More like a haunted house than a hotel,"The photos make this hotel look modern and cool, but don’t be fooled. The place is seriously overdue for a renovation. It’s a dump. A good hotel can make your vacation, but a bad one can ruin it. We cut our stay in Amsterdam short by 3 days because of Hotel Arena.

Rooms are battered from repeated use, windows have flaking paint, water damage and discoloration that could be mold (see photos), the floor and doors creak all night long, and hallways are dirty with stained carpets and forks and cups left on the window sills all day long.

Even in its better days, I doubt this was a good hotel. It’s clear that the developer went cheap when converting the building from a historic nursing home to a hotel. Instead of gutting the building interior, they added floating floors to run additional electric and water lines. That explains the weird layout of our room. 

We booked a tower suite - Room 165 - which had no less than three different floor levels. Enter the room and you’re on a very small level, just big enough for the door to swing open. Step up 2 inches and you’re on the room’s floating floor, which was uneven and sagged in one spot. Meanwhile the toilet and the curiously placed bathtub are on a platform 6 inches above the rest of the room. You have to be careful walking, lest you trip. 

And, oh, that bathtub. It’s placed like it’s the showpiece of the room, out in the open like you’re the pasha taking a bath for all to see. Fabulous bathtub, if you’re into that, but our suite didn’t have a separate shower. It had only a shower stack partly separated from the bathtub by a pane of glass, with no separation at all from the the sink! My wife couldn’t do her makeup while I took a shower, lest she go soaked. That’s not a shower, that’s a wet room like you’d find in a 2-star hotel. It’s no surprise to learn that Arena began as a youth hostel long ago. That thinking was carried forward to the design of this hotel.

These are details and annoyances that maybe you can look past. But it’s impossible to look past the terrible housekeeping. Our room was dirty, with dust bunnies from past visitors piled up around the curtains. Maids never did a proper job sweeping or cleaning. They really just made the bed and changed the towels, if they came at all. We also had to ask for housekeeping at 5 PM after our room hadn’t been made all day.

Lastly, you may not get a decent nights sleep because of the total lack of soundproofing in the building. You’ll hear the storks shrieking in the courtyard, you’ll hear guests walking in their room and hear doors banging all night long. 

",1,2023,07,21
100,Bad experience till now,"I have received a welcoming message from the hotel before arrival, in which they said  that if i sent them  our  information before arrival , we would have a hassle free check in , I highly appreciated this message and I was very optimistic about my stay , so I sent all information needed such as  who is staying in which room and all needed information , I told the hotel in my reply  that I would prefer my kids room to be close to mine , what happened was the opposite they did not prepare anything, they said they didn’t know that we have sent the information, they gave us a small room in one floor and 2 others in another floor which could not be reached by elevator , stairs only , when I told the receptionist ( Seb……) that I sent you that I need the rooms to be close to each other ,he said very rudely it’s not for you to demand we decide not you , while I was requesting not demanding which could be reviewed from the email sent , the check in took long time the receptionist was very very rude, the room is much below expectations, the pictures posted on their site is far from reality ,towels are worn out ( see picture) , service is not satisfactory , example a friend left me a small box of chocolate at the concierge or front desk to be delivered to the room  ,they didn’t send it up , when we called them they said they  were  sorry as they  just deliver room service only , and added that we have to come down to pick it up!
The location of the hotel is good but I cannot recommend it at all , by the way , I am writing this review on my first day , God knows what would we see in the next few days !!!!",2,2023,07,21
100,Amazing hotel in the most prefect location!,"The hotel was BEUTIFUL. it really noticeable that every detail was taken in consideration for the guests well being. everything is beautiful. super clean. and our room was wonderful.
the view of the park and the option to go there for a walk in any given moment really upgraded our experience! 
we will go back FOR SURE!",5,2023,07,11
100,Would stay here again,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Beautiful location with it being built onto a park, and the interior of the hotel is lovely. The rooms are sizeable and very comfy, the hotels bar has a great atmosphere and is a great place to have a few drinks before going out, Public transport is very efficient with tram stops stationed right outside of the hotel otherwise the city centre is roughly a 45 minute walk.",5,2023,07,08
100,Perfect stay!,"We stayed for 2 nights in a room with the stair. Loved it. 
Clean, functional and comfortable. Nice restaurant on site. Reception good and efficient. No issues, pleasant stay. 
Close to city centre. Just walk for 20-30 minutes and you get to any point of interest. Quite peaceful area. Will come back.",5,2023,07,07
100,My honest feedback,"The hotel was excellent, boasting a vast and beautiful garden right in front of it. The rooms were cozy and comfortable, and the staff, particularly Ms. Lotte, were incredibly accommodating and professional throughout the check-in and check-out process. I would recommend this nice hotel to anyone who is looking to relax. ",5,2023,06,29
100,Relaxing Luxury in Beautiful Surrounding,"The Hotel Arena is a luxury hotel away from the bustle of central Amsterdam.  The hotel's restaurant and extensive outdoor patio overlook a beautiful city park, giving one the sense that the park is the hotel's front yard.  The interior public spaces (restaurant, hallways, meeting rooms, front desk, etc.) are quite beautiful.  Everything is clean and functional.  In every instance the staff was very pleasant and effective.  My guest room had a few minor blemishes, but nothing that detracted from my stay.  From what I saw, I would say the target demographic for this hotel is the well-to-do young professional, but I enjoyed myself even though I am approaching retirement age.

The breakfast was very nice, a good combination of traditional European and American fare.

Note for Americans:  As with most European hotels, the linens provided in the bathroom do not include a wash cloth.

The immediate neighborhood was very quiet and relaxed, but restaurant and shopping opportunities were only a short walk away.  The hotel is well situated for easy access to public transportation with three tram lines within a five minute stroll, and a metro stop available with a ten minute walk.

I enjoyed my stay and feel the price, pretty stiff by my usual standards, is justified by the location and quality of the building and staff.

100,Good hotel 🏨- thank you!,Wonderful hotel. Timo has taken good care as has the whole team! And love the location on the park. The room was very nice with high ceilings and two floors and a well done bathroom. I am sure all would enjoy this hotel!,5,2023,06,25
100,"The hotel looks great, but not good for sound","The hotel itself is pretty amazing. I cannot fault the design or the finishes. The location is far from the action. 40mins walk to where we spent most of the weekend - I know we could have used bikes but it's not easy navigating a new city on 2 wheels and it can be a bit chaotic if you're not familiar with the Dutch system. My main gripe was the lack of insulation in the rooms. Each morning from 8-10am, I could hear every door open and close, I could hear upstairs walking around, I could hear conversations in the hallway, every single word. I could even hear someone using the loo (and I don't mean just their flushing). This really affected our stay. I don't get many chances to sleep in and so I was hoping to while at Hotel Arena but it was impossible. I could bring ear plugs but for a hotel of this standard, I would expect more care to be given to sound proofing to rooms. ",3,2023,06,19
100,Beautiful Hotel with A* staff and customer service. Let down by the old building requiring some plumbing work,"My boyfriend and I visited for 6 nights in June 2023.  Upon arrival we were kindly given a packet of Stroop waffles each by staff and a locker to store our luggage in until check in. Our room was large and spacious, as was the bathroom. We were provided with bath robes, bath salts amongst other toiletries. The bedroom also had a cooler with some water inside and a coffee machine with complimentary coffees. There was only one small cupboard to store clothes, which made things quite difficult as we were in Amsterdam for a week. Considering the size of the bedroom it would be easy to fit a set of draws.
The breakfast was lovely, a buffet style with a large range of foods and some fresh smoothies/juices. The staff were very hospitable and always greeted everyone with a smile when they arrived for breakfast, it was very welcoming :) The Hotel faces onto the Oosterpark which makes for a beautiful view in the early mornings. 
One significant thing to note is that the smell of the shower drains was particularly pungent in the morning. The smell would range from stale urine to very smelly sewage (especially if the toilet was used in the morning). Whilst this was a major downside for the room, the staff were exemplary at handling this, very kind, caring and efficient! A HUGE thank you to Lisa who went above and beyond in trying to fix this for us and eventually finding us another room to stay in :) The first time we noticed the smell someone was sent out to inspect the drains that day, even though the smell had gone when we returned in the evening, it returned the next morning. That morning, some staff members visited our room with us, took up the drains and attempted to fix the problem (we left for the day whilst they were still working so were not sure exactly what was done) - we were promised that if the smell did not resolve itself that we would be moved into another room. Unfortunately the next day the smell returned again and Lisa organised for my boyfriend and I to move to another room, she was so kind to put us in a room that was one of her personal favourites and backed onto a little private garden!  
Thank you so much Lisa! You're a star! 

Even with the problem with the first room, I'd still recommend the Hotel! Location is not too far outside of central but away from the bustling touristy areas, beautiful views, spacious rooms and lovely staff :)",4,2023,06,13
100,"Very enjoyable stay, great support from Sarah at front desk","We had a very enjoyable stay at Hotel Arena. Fantastic positioning onto the park, central location. Sarah at the front desk gave great assistance and support. Would recommend the hotel in the future to others.",5,2023,06,12
100,Don’t waste your money on a Deluxe room upgrade.,"Don't Waste Your Money on a Deluxe Room

Rating: 2.5 out of 5

I write this review with a heavy sense of disappointment following my recent stay at the Hotel Arena. I was looking forward to a grand, luxurious experience and while the hotel itself is impressive, the booking process leaves much to be desired.

Upon booking a deluxe room through Hotels.com, I envisioned a spacious and well-appointed space where comfort meets elegance. However, the reality fell short of expectation. To my chagrin, the room I received seemed notably less grand than anticipated, especially when compared to my traveling companion's room of the same category. My room was noticeably smaller and lacked the bathtub which was clearly featured in photos of a deluxe room on hotels.com booking site.  

I expressed my concerns to the reception staff only to be met with a less than satisfactory response. One member even went as far as blaming me for the mistake, insinuating that the error was due to booking through hotels.com  website. The second staff member I conversed with was equally unhelpful, insisting that the room I was in was indeed a deluxe room. The lack of understanding and empathy were quite disconcerting and tarnished the overall experience.

Now, let me not entirely dismiss the merits of the hotel. In terms of aesthetics and amenities, Hotel Arena certainly knows how to impress. The standard rooms are good, offering clean, comfortable spaces with all the essential amenities. The food at the restaurant is also worth mentioning, both for its quality and the attentiveness of the staff. The ambience there helped salvage a part of the otherwise tainted experience.

Despite the unfortunate encounter with the hotel’s room allocation and front desk customer service, I am open to giving Hotel Arena another chance. However, I would caution future guests against spending additional money for a so-called ""upgrade"" that may not be delivered. I remain hopeful that the hotel will address these issues promptly, ensuring that all guests receive the room they booked and the quality service they deserve.

Overall, Hotel Arena has the potential to offer a memorable stay, but it's critical they align their service delivery with the expectations set during booking. In the future, I might consider returning, but rest assured, I will not be wasting my money on a room upgrade that does not live up to its promise.",3,2023,06,08
100,Great property inside and out.,"Very nice property.  Generous size rooms with comfortable beds.  Oversize bathroom with modern fixtures.

Better bathroom layout would make it more functional.  Large bathroom but double sink, toilet, shower and tub all shared the same space which limited use to one person at a time.

Many outdoor sitting areas and large park adjoins the property.  Very nice apppeal.

Somewhat pricey rooms and add-ons for such things as roll-away beds.  Would like to see rooms with two queen beds to accomodate families.",5,2023,06,07
100,Beautiful stay,"Calm, beautiful hotel set in a green park - highly recommend. Great facilities - service is a little slow but in a chilled way. 
Room was small but clean and great value for money. I would happily return again.
Nibbles and drinks in the bar were a great start to our trip.",5,2023,06,06
100,Awful experience,"They could not find our booking that we had made on their own website and confirmed with a valid credit card. We still had the working booking email which took us through to our booking which could be canceled/modified on their website/our account up until the day before (24 hours before arrival). I had checked this as I tried to extend our booking earlier that week and it would let me book an extra night. It was an active and a confirmed booking. It showed our booking said confirmed with all our information including the valid credit card. Then they blamed us for not paying for it on an email/link that was never sent and said it had been cancelled because of this. This was apparently last year and no communication from them or email has been received showing the booking had been cancelled. They couldn't explain why the website/account email login showed our booking as active and confirmed. They would not take responsibility. Eventually found us a room but not a good stay considering all this. We didn't know if we would be able to stay as the hotel was ""full"". After about 30 mins at gone midnight they ""found us somewhere to get some rest for the night"" and it took until the following morning for them to let us know we could stay without any room changes. Rooms very loud if they back into the road. No compensation. A complete shambles and a very tired and stressful stay. We were kind a courteous to them and only one staff member who wasn't directly dealing with the issue said sorry for what had happened. The 2 more senior staff that handled the issue did not. I've never encountered anything like it.

Interested to see the reply they post on here and if they apologise or if they post a similar reply to the email they sent us - ""After booking we send a payment link to receive the payment within 24 hours. The payment was not done within this time which means the booking was not guaranteed and my colleague did cancel the reservation.""

You did not send anything, a link, a notification of cancellation, nothing.

For clarity I will leave screenshots of our booking here.",1,2023,06,05
100,Not bad at all,"Nice atmosphere and design everywhere: lobby, outside, toilets, corridors, halls, and of course rooms
Somehow and strangely enough, a bit slow at the bar 
But generally speaking not bad at all overall ",4,2023,06,03
100,One receptionist spoiled our stay....,"After being shown to the tiniest room up in the eaves/attic space ( A different receptionist confirmed it was the tiniest room)Room 240, which is only suitable for a young, single occupant.  I contacted reception to be told by Sebastian (Bas) ""This isn't a Premier Inn, and as we requested a room with no stairs, this was what was on offer.""  I merely pointed out that the bed was pushed up to a wall with a sloping roof on one side, so either myself or my husband, both 67 years old, would have to scramble over one or the other to get out.!  How lucky were we that another room ""had just become available"".  Ten minutes later????   We then went to room 101,  a proper sized room with a wardrobe and seating area.  Expensive place but it was where we wanted to be.  All other staff were friendly and very helpful.  Shame they have to put a rude man on reception where first impressions count.
 ",3,2023,05,18
100,Wonderful mini break,"Super comfortable bed, very spacious room, very friendly and helpful staff. Love this city, Jordaan in the sunshine outside a bar by the canal was the best experience. Seafood bar lunch impressive. Just wandering the streets a lovely way to work up an appetite 😋",5,2023,05,16
100,A nice stay,"A beautiful hotel in a great location to walk to restaurants and shops. The rooms are clean, the shower is hot, and the beds are amazingly comfy.  The morning breakfast has just about everything and more.  The staff was very professional.  I like the resident kitty that is seen about as well.",5,2023,05,05
100,"nice hotel, good room but only one duven to share","The large bed is so soft at the edges, that you have not sleep in the outer ½ meter, else you will end on the floor, and you have to share one duven.

I looks nice with the curtains in the tall hallways, but one can not but think about whether it is safe in case of fire.

Expensive compared to its standard. You have to be tall to use the mirrors, as 180 cm high I could only see the eyes and hair at the bathroom. The water is hoter than the termostat says. Bathtop is dangerous smooth.

The restaurant is ok, but I was attacted by waiter after leaving for not paying, when  I had paid to another waiter. Very unpleasant and unprofessional despite all the excuses.",4,2023,05,01
100,A lovely place to stay,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay at Hotel Arena.  Every member of staff, without exception, was charming, polite and good- humoured.  We enjoyed the breakfasts and ate in the restaurant on two evenings - all delightful.  The room we stayed in was very large and attractive but one ot two things were not quite up to standard.  The marble top bedside tables are not a good idea as cups and glasses just slide off the glassy surface.  The bath is luxurious but you can’t access the soap etc.  The shower spills water everywhere and makes the floor very slippery and potentially, very dangerous. 

We always feel that management should spend a couple of nights in these rooms to check what works and what doesn’t. It wouldn’t t take much to make the rooms perfect. 

Overall, we still wish to award 5 stars and would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",5,2023,04,29
100,Mrs Di Wallin,"Room was lovely, but could do with a mirror near the sockets for using hair dryers/ straighteners! Towel shel & coat hooks too high for short people! Due to mobility issues the step up to the seating area too high!  Very comfy bed & lovely shower room",4,2023,04,29
100,Ok stay…………,"Our first time in Amsterdam. Stayed 3 nights at the hotel on the recommendation of our travel agent.

Good points:
Nice location next to Oosterpark. Great for a stroll.
Easy accessible lockers available if you need to leave your luggage.
Welcoming bar/dining area where you can sit outside and overlook the park.
(Mostly) helpful and knowledgable staff.

Not so nice points:
Be careful what room you choose. Some are very small and there is very little storage space. Even for a short break! 
Walls are paper thin. Our last nights stay was terrible with us being woken up at 3am by the party next door. (We did contact reception and it was dealt with but only after a while). 
Our room was not available despite a 3 o’clock check in time. (We weren’t the only ones). And for the other 2 days we stayed we had to ask for our room to be cleaned despite it being around 4pm.
The hotel was a little further out of the centre than we realised (but there was a good tram system nearby)

An overall ‘ok’ stay.",3,2023,04,26
100,Good hotel but there is room for improvement ,"Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff, lovely decor and nice rooms apart from the stairs up to the bedroom. If you are elderly or have mobility issues I recommend asking if your room comes with stairs up to the bedroom, they are narrow at points and difficult to navigate with poor mobility other than that the rooms we stayed in were lovely. The only other negative was that my own personal Egyptian cotton towels were taken from my room by cleaning staff, they also didn't replace our toilet rolls or clean the bed sheets so not really sure what it is the cleaning staff actually did apart from supply us with fresh towels as we kept our room tidy.",4,2023,04,25
100,Lovely Hotel on Beautiful Grounds,I stayed for a 2 night 3 day stay with my adult son.  It was perfectly situated within walking distance of trams and restaurants.  We got there early and they provided very large lockers to store our suitcases.  We went on tours and to a late dinner and were able to check in and retrieve our bags later that evening. The restaurant was good and hotel staff were all wonderful.,5,2023,04,21
100,Decent hotel in a good location,"The hotel was nice, set in a really lovely park with decent travel links, a couple of tram stops close by and the metro a little further away but definitely walking distance. Unfortunately we found the staff quite rude and there doesn't seem to be any maid service? We stayed for 3 nights and the room wasn't cleaned once. The walls were also very thin, had to listen to our neighbours snoring every night and arguing every day! We also found the deposit of £50 per night very high. ",3,2023,04,10
100,"Lovely hotel and room, great location","Myself and a group of friends stayed and we had a lovely time, the rooms very nice, comfortable, clean, the hotel itself was to a very high standard with very interesting history and architecture. Overlooking the park and close enough to tram stops etc to get back into the centre. Restaurant and bar staff all great, food good. Agree there needs to be a warning of the €50 per person per night deposit, which for a group of 6 across 3 nights was expensive but there was no problem refunding it. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2023,03,28
100,Deposit warning,"Lovely hotel, peaceful area. However neither their own website or third party stated the €50 a night deposit. This is something that should be made know before booking, as it did affect our trip as we were here a week",4,2023,03,18
100,"Lovely room, but there's opportunity for improvement too",We had a lovely stay at Hotel Arena in one of their suites. The hotel is beautiful and the room was even impressive. One problem though: the room was very cold upon arrival and it took almost 24 hours for the room to reach a comfortable temperature. I think that the staff should have realised that and switch on the heating earlier.,4,2023,03,13
100,Lovely quaint hotel away from the hustle and bustle ,"We visited Hotel Arena as part of my wife's birthday celebrations. Upon arrival we felt so welcome and the staff were very friendly, in particular Liza who welcomed us. I made the hotel aware the stay was part of my wife's birthday and the staff went out of their way to make the stay memorable. Our room was lovely and modern, the shower in particular was fantastic. 
The bar and dining area was well manned and service was always very quick, the burger is recommended.
The Hotel is in a good location, a nice walk from the train station when you first arrive and is very close to one tram route which gets you back into town.
A great hotel and I would not hesitate staying in again ",5,2023,03,11
100,Not my type of hotel,"I entered the room and it was freezing cold. The walls and the floor were all cold. The room had a small heater and I turned it on to the maximum but that small heater would not be able to fight the cold piercing through the window and walls. There is no central heating. The bathroom had no heater at all, so using the bathroom while it was snowing outside was an adventure. The room was also smelly. The hotel has a complex set of corridors and ramps and shlepping the luggage up and down was no fun. There was no one to help. The bathroom had no toothbrush or toothpaste to offer. The so called double bed were two single beds pushed together and things fall between the cracks. So not really a double bed. The desk in the room is merely decorative. It is not made for sitting there to work on your laptop. Half of the space in the room is eaten up by the sloping roof. The parking of the car was unclear, it was meant to be 50 € for 24h. But if you leave once and come back, you paid 50€ for nothing and need to buy a new ticket. The Hyatt next door is far more comfortable.",2,2023,03,10
100,A decent stay,"The hotel is situated in a lovely quiet park, the building is beautiful. However, We check in to the hotel, and we are told it is £50 per night deposit for the room and also £48 tax. This shocked us as we were not warned of this at all and we’re disappointed we had to take £250 out of our spending money to pay for this. Although the hotel is lovely this really put a bit of a damper on it for us. The rooms were okay, had to change rooms after the first night because they gave us two single beds instead of a double and also the shower was leaking. The second room was much better, The staff dealt with this quickly and there were no issues changing the room. In terms of cleaning, our room did not get cleaned whilst we were there, they clean quite late in the afternoon, we would go back to the room for a drink around 4:30pm and they still hadn’t done it and we ended up putting up the do not disturb sign as we did not want to be bothered when we were having a drink. 
Overall, not a bad stay location is great and the hotel is stylish, but was a little bit of a let down because the issues that I mentioned.",3,2023,02,22
100,An Amazing Trip Away!  Will Go Back.,"On arrival, we got out of our Taxi at the gate to the Oosterpark and approached the front of the hotel.  The hotel on first glance is well-located and has the benefit of the local park.  There is a green and tranquil feel to the place.  There is a small lake and birds in the lake and a tennis court nearby.

The reception area was small - also has a small shop but very well organized and check-in was quick and painless.  Kudos to Justin for getting us checked in and off to our rooms with minimal fuss.  The bar and restaurant area was very fashionably appointed with a fake log burner at the entrance (where we sat when we arrived).  The drinks and food were reasonably priced for a hotel and the food was delicious.  Service was quick and the staff couldn't do enough for us.

Our room was a corner room on the first floor, two twin beds pushed together to make a double bed.  The room had a TV, Air Conditioning and two sky light windows with a view of the park.  The bathroom was clean and to our liking with the shower being very hot and relaxing.  Towels were clean and soft with them being replaced each day.  I slept well on the bed and I'm usually a fussy sleeper - this might have been due to the miles walked around Amsterdam!

Getting from the hotel to the Centre of Amsterdam was easy.  A short walk to the ""K. s-Gravesandstr"" Tram stop on Sarphatistraat (Street name).  Or you could walk a little further to the Underground stop at Weesperplein and get an Underground Train to Amsterdam Central.  A 24h ticket is around 10 euros and you can use it on all public transport.  We bought this in the tube station but you can also use the app.  You'll walk a lot in Amsterdam - so cut this a little by using the tram and Underground to get about.

There is a ferry (The F3) that you can take to the Adam Lookout from the back of the Centraal Station.  This was a favorite of ours from our trip.  (There's also a great Fries place when you get off the Ferry!).",5,2023,02,09
100,Beautiful hotel,"Travelling alone always comes with its challenges of choosing a nice hotel & this one was exceptional. 
Great staff, all very welcoming. The room standard comfort could have passed for a deluxe. Comfortable bed, large wardrobe, even a couch!  Nothing was ever too much trouble. My only minor point would be it’s not close to the centre so public transport must be researched before you go.  Otherwise highly recommended",5,2023,02,07
100,Nice hotel in lovely grounds,"Lovely hotel in a nice location. About 15 minutes on tram to the centre. Room was lovely although could do with being cleaner- lots of dust and the sofa had hairs and crumbs all over. Also the duvet inside the cover was horribly stained. The bar and restaurant very stylish and lovely food and cocktails. Quite pricey, especially if you get a drink from the reception shop so maybe get drinks from local shop instead. 
Word of warning - you also have to give a credit card which holds 150 damage deposit. We were not aware of this before we arrived but luckily had a credit card. 
Overall nice hotel and would stay again as its away from the bustle of the central city.",4,2023,02,06
100,Great Family Stay,"The place was amazing, service was great! Thank you to the staff for making our trip unforgetable. We loved everything from the room, to the quite location and especially the amazing park around the hotel. Great restuarants everywhere!",5,2023,01,17
100,Worst hotel experience ever,"I was extremely disappointed with the cleanliness of my room (046) on the first night of my stay. I had to go to the front desk five times to request cleaning, and even then, the cleaners only came three times and did not meet the minimal standards of hygiene that my wife and I expected. It was not until 11pm that they finally sent two people to properly clean the room. Even when the room was clean, the noise from the street made it impossible for us to get a good night's sleep. The next morning, I requested a new room (129) which was clean and quiet, but I was still charged the price difference. Additionally, I found the breakfast to be overpriced considering its quality. Overall, this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had.",1,2023,01,02
100,Parkside hotel in Amsterdam,"Very comfortable hotel by a big park. Several tram lines run nearby. Spacious rooms. Beautifully decorated restaurant. Friendly staff.
The only minus is a relatively big deposit that was not even refunded immediately.",4,2022,12,30
100,Gorgeous park hotel,"I really loved this hotel and it is the best I've stayed in in Amsterdam in terms of aesthetics. Beautiful location with a park on your doorstep but about a 30 min walk from the centre. Gorgeous, modern rooms, but a little too cramped (no space to organise luggage), great customer service but a surprise deposit of around €300 for 5 nights. 

Welcoming and friendly team, two free drinks on arrival, nice clean rooms with cleaning everyday, lovely bathroom. The bar/restaurant area was just beautiful! We were very impressed and the grounds were lavishly decorated for Christmas.

My only real concern was the space/the steep stairs to the bedroom on the upper part of the split room. I wouldn't recommend the standard, split-floor room for anybody with an injury/disability. It would be pretty easy to slip and fall because of the short steps that curl up to the upper part of the room.

All in all a wonderful trip and a lovely hotel!",4,2022,12,28
100,"Recommend this hotel, for sure.","Great service, facilities and restaurant. What I really liked was the design of the hotel which is a little bit different to traditional hotels. Recommend you to try this hotel for your next Amsterdam trip.",5,2022,12,19
100,Fabulous,"When first entering the hotel, you’re greeted with a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Checking in procedures are very easy. The room was like a mini apartment: the sitting area and the bathroom on one level and the bedroom area on the upper level. The room beautifully decorated, clean and tidy. I particularly liked the hanging basket chair, it was a lovely touch. The view from the room was overlooking the lake in the park and on the other side the street across the room was bustling with activity. 
The bar area and the restaurant was very nice. The service in the restaurant was good and efficient and the food arrived hot and tasty cooked exactly how I like it.",5,2022,12,16
100,Miss Nicole Bury,"We came to Arena Hotel for 4 nights for a Christmas get away. All the staff were so lovely ❤️ the hotel was spotless and nothing out of place. A few days before we left they started decorating ready for Christmas and made it so magical. 

Thank you Team Arena x",5,2022,12,10
100,Needs a rethink,The designers have made it look nice but it doesn't work. The bathroom in many rooms is a black glass cubilcle which takes up too much room and is ugly. You are urged to save water but the basin has no plug and hot water takes an age to get through. We stayed for three nights and saw no maid service. The bed linen was of cheap quality and the sheets were not fitted so the bottom sheet got 'lost' during the night. The furniture looks quaint but is entirely impractical with flimsy tables and little storage space (aimed at the backpackers?). The breakfast was not worth 19.50 and room service charge is 10.00. The restaurant menu could only appeal to a few with few popular dishes. Do they want repeat custom.,2,2022,12,06
100,Quiet hotel in Amsterdam,"Hotel locates close to city center (could be rich by tram or walking about 25 minutes), opens directly to nice park. Quiet hotel in old building with non-standard plan. Clean rooms, welcome staff, good breakfast and bar/restaurant at the evening on terrace looking to the park. Good place for staying far from main city crowds. Remark - some rooms are far from entrance or elevator. Huge building waits more investments (the owners try to do they best).",5,2022,11,20
100,nice stay in a nice room,"beautiful location, nice building. Few remarks:
- the wash-hand basin was stopped up
- the wire connecting the watercooker and power socket was too short
- the temperature in the room was on arrival 25°C (november!). How about some energysaving?",3,2022,11,20
100,Business member meting,"All through a very nice place to relax and enjoy time. Food and accommodation were excellent.
Only negative point is, that it is a pity, that the bar closes at 01:00 even though a lot of barguests still had a good time in the bar and was not yet ready to go to sleep. This resulted in ending of a fine evening quite “unpleasant”.",4,2022,11,20
100,Beautiful weekend in Amsterdam,We stayed for 4 nights and the hotel was amazing. We were on the 3rd floor in the eves with great views of the courtyard and park. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. We ate at the hotel once and just had drinks and bites in the bar which was lovely. As it is not in the centre of town it feels like a great place to escape to after a busy day explore the city. We would highly recommend staying at Hotel Arena.,5,2022,11,15
100,"Enjoy my stay a lot, very calm and relaxing atmosphere. Very nice place to stay !","We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is well located and offers a standard service. The deposit of 150€ was a surprise. 
I would suggest the hotel to revise the cleaning procedures in the rooms. When I went in the room the impression was that it was not “shining”…. The amenities were very good.
I would recommend my friends to stay there",4,2022,11,14
100,Don’t eat at the restaurant,"The Hotel itself is stunning, no issue with anything during our stay. The restaurant attached is appalling. I ordered a wagyu burger and my girlfriend ordered a Caesar salad. 

The egg in the salad (odd choice anyway) was undercooked and horrible. The burger (ordered as a medium Well) was still raw in the middle and cold. When we received the food we then waited 20 minutes for service in order to tell them about the issues I was informed I’d ‘ordered it medium rare so it was fine’

When we finally did get the chance to query our issues the manager came over and told me (argued with me) that it was completely normal and the kitchen had approved this. I don’t profess to be a connoisseur, but when the burger is stone cold and barely cooked I’d say that’s not normal and if it was I’d have serious worries about my restaurant. 

We were then offered a ‘discount’ for less than the price of a Pint when we had only eaten the chips that came with the burger and we’d barely even touched them. 

All in all a horrendous experience and would definitely not recommend to anyone staying in or near the hotel.",1,2022,11,10
100,Amazing hotel. Beautiful city!,"just got back from a 3 night visit, and This hotel was amazing, check in was easy but you had to pay 150 euro deposit which was fine but they didn’t expect cash so we had to use our card so make sure you have your bank card and we got it back 2 days after we got home 😁 you have to pay hotel tax which was around 60 euro (this goes on what room you have) but they just minus this from our deposit which was easier for us. 

The staff was lovely and polite (read a review where they said they were rude) but they were so helpful and friendly. We had the standard suite and I mean WOW… we was in room 275 (this is one of the better ones we was told) which was on the corner so you can see the view of the park which was lovely. Even had an egg swing upstairs so you can just watch the night away 😍 the rooms were cleaned every day and the bed was so comfy. The only thing we was expecting was a bath but only had a shower which wasn’t a massive deal. The park is a lovely walk. 

The city centre was 30 min walk or a short tram ride which was cheap enough and there is a shop just down the road by the tram stop Everything is pretty close so we manage to ram in as much as we could visiting several things in just a day! 

We would definitely come back to this hotel. This is the nicest hotel I’ve ever been in 😍 my only tip is that most of the Amsterdam don’t expect cash so you will need to take both with you! :) ",5,2022,11,08
100,Lovely trip!,"We both really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. 
Very nice location near a park, aprox 10 min walk to the nearest metro station which brings you into the city centre (3 stops). 
Staff were friendly, we had dinner 1 night in the hotel and it was lovely. 
Only negative is that our room was on a split level and very hot in the upstairs area. There is an air con unit but based downstairs. ",4,2022,11,07
100,AMAZING FOOD & AMAZING STAFF,"The room was decorated for my birthday. We had balloons, chocolate and 2 free drinks included. Not only were the staff super friendly, our hotel room was clean and the food was delicious too. I’ve never stayed in such a nice hotel and all of the staff be so lovely as well as the hotel.",5,2022,11,02
100,with the exception of cleanliness the rest was excellent,"Big and warm room, great location, extraordinary  beauty, quietness, the park outside, helpful and friendly staff. Everything was very good but they have opportunities for improvement in matters of cleanliness.",4,2022,10,26
100,Exceptional Stay In Amsterdam,"Exceptional stay. We traveled with my almost 4 year old daughter and this hotel was top notch. Our room was spacious, the property was unique and beautiful, drinks & dining were delicious, and the location was perfect being steps from Oosterpark. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples, families, and business guests.",5,2022,10,20
100,Extremely dirty rooms and the staff couldn't care at all. No value for money.,"The rooms were extremely dirty and during our 4 night stay, I asked the front desk to clean up The room properly two times, and nothing happened. I even showed the spider web pictures. No apologies, no actions, nothing. I felt like the staff didn't really care at all. 

The two stars out of five come from the nice location near the park and a cool lobby / restaurant area. 

To summarize, I would stay away from this hotel, and look for somewhere else. Not value for money, at all. ",2,2022,10,17
100,Great Stay.,"We had a lovely stay at Hotel Arena. Our room was huge and warm. It could have done with a bit more decor as it did feel a little bare but it was incredibly comfortable. A nice sofa and TV and crazily comfortable bed. 

We hired bikes from the hotel for one day as it isn't very central. It takes about 10 minutes to bike into the heart of Amsterdam and 30 mins to walk. There are a few places to eat out locally but i would recommend the hotel restaurant. Delicous food and really fun atmosphere.",4,2022,10,12
100,interesting  special place,"I loved to sit in the restaurant and by the fireplace- my stay was very relaxing.
the hotel is very busy and there  are many day guests for conferences , etc.
the rooms are very special, our room was a little bit dark and in the bathroom we found no heater. the concept with room cleaning is  not really clear. 
the surrounding of the hotel is beautiful and relaxing to sit in the park or terrace.",4,2022,10,05
100,Best Club Bagel Ever…,"Great lunch experience - outstanding Club Bagel!

Just an all round brilliant experience and a lovely environment…plants everywhere - inside and outside dining options, very chilled setting…the only small “fly in the ointment” is a bit of a shortage of staff…waiting too long to be served to start off with…

…even with that it is still a great place",4,2022,10,03
100,Worst service and very dirty,"From outside and from booking the hotel looks a dream,but since the moment we entered at the hotel they asked for 150 euro garanty fee and 37 euro taxes,when we payed everything online was inclued. They didnt clean our room for all the staying we were there, only changed the towels. And 2 of the reception girls were very rude saying we dont accept cash.the location was 30min from the center by walking,quite ok but not worthy for the price of the room around 120 euro",1,2022,09,29
100,Disappointing,"I am currently staying here and it is beyond disappointing. I did a ton of research and this hotel had great reviews so I booked it for a week and hoped for the best. The hotel itself is beautiful. The guest care is non existent. There is NOTHING 4 star about this hotel. The room itself is basic. The heat in my room doesn’t work, so I’m having to use a space heater. They do not have wash cloths, only medium and large size towels, so had to go buy a wash cloth for washing my face. The first room they put me in was overlooking an alley covered in trash, so I asked for a different one and got this room with the non working heat. These are the “deluxe” rooms.

I just ate at the restaurant  for the first time. I ordered a soup and a risotto. I was full after the soup and had only a few bites of the risotto so figured I’d pack it up and have a snack for later. Turns out that wasn’t an option. They did not have togo boxes or containers of any kind. Even though I’m staying in the hotel, they couldn’t and wouldn’t accommodate me in any way so that I could take it with me. The “manager” came over with an aggressive and visibly irritated attitude and said to me that in holland people don’t take food togo so they don’t have containers. Hmmm that doesn’t seem like accurate information. Pretty sure take out exists everywhere in the world. I said if I couldn’t take it with me it didn’t feel right to pay for an entree that I only had a few bites of, to which she responded, and this is a direct quote “well that’s on you for ordering it”.  This is how a manager handles something? So yes I payed $22 euro for an entree that I took a few bites out of, just for it to be thrown away. Went to the front desk and explained what happened, nothing. Nobody cares.  I felt myself starting to cry out of frustration and disappointment, so went back to my room. 

For one weeks stay it cost $2250. I was “treating” myself to what I thought was going to be a nice hotel and experience.  Disappointing to say the least. So if you want to stay in a pretty hotel and don’t care about how you’re treated and don’t mind over paying for a basic room, go for it.",2,2022,09,29
100,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel, great location, friendly staff. Beautiful building and some great features, good food and nice casual restaurant. Water in the hotel room would have been nice. Great park outside the hotel for walks and relaxation. Close to everything.",4,2022,09,25
100,Lovely Short Break,"We stayed at Hotel Arena for two nights, going away for my partners Birthday. The Hotel is beautiful, we are both Lighting Designers and really enjoyed the lighting throughout the hotel. All the staff were incredibly friendly and we were thrilled we had the option to have a tree planted on our behalf instead of having our room cleaned. 
It’s in a great location set next to a beautiful park and far enough from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but only a short tram ride away from all the action. 
We will definitely be returning next time we visit Amsterdam.",5,2022,09,22
100,Great place to stay!,"My stay at the hotel didn't begin well. Staff had confirmed my request to have two separate beds. But the room they gave us was a single bed. After some confusion, they directed us to another room that worked for that night. And they made up for their error by upgrading us to a bigger room - nice move!

Now, about the hotel: it's a beautiful and funky place that opens onto a city park. They paid a lot of attention to the details and got them right. 

Three different tram lines pass with several blocks of the hotel, so it's easy to get to the city center on public transportation. (everyone, it seems, speaks English and will help you figure out how to get aboard) The hotel rents bikes, but we didn't use that. The hotel has a lively bar/restaurant. 

What else? The Internet was good.

The hotel arranged for an early-morning taxi to the airport.

It's definitely not a cookie-cutter hotel, and that's good!",5,2022,09,22
100,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, amazing trip!","My partner and I went to Amsterdam to celebrate my 30th birthday in August 2022. He booked a suite at Hotel Arena for the duration of our stay. When checking in our room wasn’t ready and the staff were very apologetic and offered us a free drink in their bar. We then went back 1 hour later and our room was still not ready. The manager could not have done enough for us, she went to check the room herself to see what was holding up check in. She then rang to reception and we were offered an upgrade for free due to the delays in check in. We weren’t expecting this, let alone the beautiful room we were upgraded to. We were given Top Suite and were one of the first guests to have stayed there. It was incredible and made my birthday celebrations even more special. The standard of the room was outstanding and there was near to nothing to fault! The only recommendations we had for the room was to have a seal on the shower to avoid it leaking out in to the bathroom area and to have a full length mirror somewhere in the suite. Other than that I could not fault it! The bath on the balcony was a lovely touch and was something I was not expecting. The overall customer service at the hotel during our stay was 5 star and we will definitely be recommending this hotel to our family and friends.
The location was great, straight out on to ooster park and a 5 minute walk to the tram that takes you straight in to the centre. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel away from the hustle and bustle, this is perfect. 
Thank you for going above and beyond and making my birthday trip amazing!!",5,2022,09,17
100,"Unique hotel,  perfect location","Went to Amsterdam for business and stayed a few extra days the hotel Arena was clean, comfortable  and filled with beautiful architecture. The hotel staff were friendly, informative and helpful.  The hotel location is perfect for walking or biking the city and you can enjoy quiet evenings and mornings thanks to the park. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2022,09,11
100,"Very nice hotel, bit a bit pricy","Very nice hotel, friendly, professional check in. Very helpful receptionist. Nice room with sofa and desk at second floor. Free internet. Clean and quite cosy. 
But it is a bit pricy.... You will find other hotels at a cheaper price just as nice. Could be the prices are up due to conference bearby. Nice restaurants in the area. I can recommend 4850.",4,2022,09,04
100,Beautiful and relaxing,"Lovely hotel situated in a beautiful park, easy access to trams to discover the area. Very clean and helpful staff great bar/restaurant area the food is excellent but the service is very disorganised. Room was unique and have never stayed in one like it before.",5,2022,08,29
100,Fantastic hotel but poor communication from staff,"On arriving at the hotel it was stunning, set in the lovely Oosterpark and the scenery is just breath taking. When at reception we were told we had to pay an €150 euro deposit for safety and we would get this back in full at the end of our stay. I don’t own a credit card so had to get my parents to loan me this money to enable us to stay there. On checking out of the hotel nothing was mentioned about getting our money back and the hotel then charged us a further €42 in city tax. So I would say yes it’s a fantastic hotel, however more needs to be done in regards to these hidden fees. I am still awaiting a response from the hotel as still I have had no money back. Not impressed with the customer service.",3,2022,08,29
100,"Very nice and stylish building, decent rooms, and bad on glutenfree","Unfortunately the stay was mared with the breakfast kitchen and staff not knowing basic Information about glutenfree and celiac friendly food making.  That is quite Unfortunately. Especialy when the Hotel is quite unique, with nice rooms and surroundings.  ",4,2022,08,28
100,Final night and topped the others on quality.,"We were a visiting group of cyclists from the UK. The support vehicle could have been an issue but staff were very helpful in securing a spot right opposite the Hotel. Rooms were luxurious and the breakfast was fantastic. Unfortunately we chose to follow a recommendation and eat at Clos nearby. That's another review!
As it turned out it would have been better to eat in house and I am sure on the basis of the rest of the experience it would have been very good.",5,2022,08,26
100,Mixed Feelings because of the bathroom,"So we checked-in around midnight, and we were asked to leave a deposit for €150. kinda weird, but understandable since there was three of us all masculine young fellas the impression they probably had was that we could cause trouble (spoiler alert: we did not). the hotel has beautiful structure, long corridor, marble steps and one lift. this elevator takes forever to come up and down but that was not trouble for us. 
What id did cause trouble was the bathroom, (picture attached). I must say that it does not offer any privacy and we were moved to another room tthe next day. this is not a complaint. i am just telling others what to expect when arriving to the hotel. all rooms have bathrooms with this features, even he one we were moved to. 
What it did  got my attention, is the staff. now, i am a hotel receptionist myself so this really shocked me: ""they don't smile, they do not communicate  more than strictly necessary"", and upon checkout i was told: ""can i finish to explain please?"" without any smile. you will see what i am talking about when you get there. my friends told me this is normal, people are particularly cold in that country. again, this is not a complaint. i am just telling people what to expect. apart from that, everything is good (Breakfast only has 2 hot options: bacon and eggs)",3,2022,08,20
100,Historic & Great for Kids,"This was a great place if you have kids and you want them to be able to enjoy a splash and play in a fountain-type wading pool as well as nice playgrounds full of entertaining equipment. The park is lovely for picnics, strolling, and bike riding. It's not far from places such as the zoo and NEMO Science museum. It's not that easy if you're dropped off by a taxi to find the entrance with a bunch of luggage. There is NO help for that and you must walk around and ask where the reception is located. It was a bit confusing as I hadn't stayed there before. The rooms are lovely and there are many areas to sit outside and enjoy a drink. They have large lockers for storing luggage which was very convenient. The rooms have AC which was great as it was quite hot in Amsterdam when I was there. I saw the family room my son, his, wife, and the 2 grandsons stayed in and it was nice. A little loft area for the kids and another small living room type area. My room had a small sofa and desk area. The wifi was good all through the hotel and there was a lift for easy access to upper floors.",4,2022,07,28
100,Good but not ok,"The hotel is nice 
The beds are not great and the sheets don’t fit the bed properly 
The beds are not one for a great sleep which is a let down because the hotel rooms are quite well appointed 
The staff in this hotel are very lazy and untrained 
DO NOT EAT AT THE RESTAURANT 
The food is somewhat similar to buying frozen food from the super market and serving it on a plate",3,2022,07,26
100,Best place I have stayed in Amsterdam!!,"Cannot fault Hotel Arena. From start to finish me and my boyfriend had an amazing trip. The room was unbelievable!! Everything you need, mini fridge, safe and even a electric fan/ heater ( depends what time of the year you are staying).
The hotel is old with a modern twist which is why we love it so much! It’s also backed onto a lovely park.
Staff was friendly and always willing to help. Bike rental was fantastic and much easier and quicker to get around the city. 
Roughly around a 30 mins walk to the centre and 10 mins on the bike. We thought it was nicer to be out of the busy main tourist bit.
A local supermarket 5 mins walk away if you wanted snacks or bottles of water.
My 3rd time in Amsterdam and this hotel was 100% my favourite! Would return again!!! :)",5,2022,07,17
100,Very disappointing,"We dined with family at the restaurant. Service glacially slow, food indifferent: burnt,dry chips. A good IPA and great location spoilt. Aged parents stayed at the hotel..slippery shower floors, no hand rails and unbearably hot at night.",1,2022,06,28
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam,"My family and I have just had dinner at the hotel Arena. It was most disappointing. We waited for about 45 minutes for our food. This was mainly soup and frites or potato chips. The chips were terrible. They tasted as if they had been made three days before and then just warmed up or refried. Dry and tasted of old oil. It is such a pity to ruin all the other food by serving such vile chips. Most restaurants in the Netherlands serve delicious frites. 
They should improve their cooking skills.",1,2022,06,27
100,Run Away from This Hotel,"My husband and I have traveled the world and stayed in many, many hotels all over the U.S. and the world, during the last 3 decades. This hotel has by far the worst service we have ever run into for the money. Our room cost almost $500/night, and we never got the room cleaned without begging. The first day the maid showed up at 5 pm - well after we needed clean towels. We were napping (jet lag) and asked her to come back at 6. She said she didn't work that late. The next two days in a row we stopped at the front desk on the way out at 9 am, and asked (begged) to have our room cleaned before we returned by 3 pm. They told us we get late service because their first priority is cleaning rooms that people have checked out of, so new guests can check in. This logic is astounding: Because we are staying 5 days we will not get our room cleaned.? Maybe the solution is to check in and to check out every day. We are finally in our last day. It is almost 3 pm, we arrived back at our room ready to nap, and guess what? NO service, NO clean towels. Hotel Arena did not break their perfect No Service record. (The service at the restaurant is abysmal as well). Best guess is that they simply do not have enough employees. Which was our problem, not theirs? Stay away from this place.",1,2022,06,18
100,Hotel Arena - Great Stay!,"My stay at the Hotel Arena was a great experience. The architecture of the historic old building was impressive at first sight. My flight arrived early and the hotel had lockers for their guests, which was convenient while the room was being prepared. The attached restaurant was a perfect place to wait. The staff is young and helpful. When my cell phone went missing, the girl in the front went out of her way to help me find it. Another staff member offered a private tour of the attached cathedral while it was closed. It's usually a venue for events and club nights and is beautiful and is historic yet includes modern details and chic bar. My room was on the top floor and it had the feel of a charming french apartment, though it seems most rooms are unique. It is located a short walk from the tram, which will take you throughout the city. I recommend the Hotel Arena and hope to be a guest again one day. Thank you!",5,2022,05,17
100,Lovely hotel on edge of nice park,"My daughter and I visited already requesting twin beds when we checked in we did not have twin beds so they were very apologetic and gave us a smaller classic room with twin beds, gave us a free lunch! Said they’d give us a different bigger room with twin beds for next two nights. However when we went to new room it still had a double bed! Couldn’t believe it then they split the bed and we ended up with midget beds! The room was fine but very cold, on our last morning there were workmen on roof at 7.00 very noisy.  We also found the hotel a bit creepy and heard some very strange noises in the night.  On the plus side the breakfast was very nice buffet style worked well for us.  Architecturaly the hotel is beautiful.  First impressions of hotel are very impressive.  Service in restaurant was a bit slow.",3,2022,05,13
100,"Nice design, Poor Service","I just returned from a 6 night stay at this hotel; primarily while in town on business.  The building is unique and location along the park nice. The room was spacious and bed comfortable.  Breakfast was fine—nothing special but convenient.

However, the service from housekeeping to check out was really poor. When I arrived, there were dirty mugs still in the room.  The drain in the shower was clogged and while the front desk was quick to have maintenance take care of it,  the 4 drenched towels that I used to clean up the mess made by the dirty water from the clog were left there. Housekeeping, if they came (and they did not come 2 days I was there) came right as I was back at my room to get ready to go out to dinner (ie: 5pm or later).  The bath supplies were not replaced and frankly after a long day of meetings and then business dinners it is beyond annoying to have to ask at the front desk for a bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner.  When I mentioned the very underwhelming housekeeping at checkout, the man at the front desk just shrugged.  He was not at all caring or friendly.
The mini refirigerator in the room had a sour odor to it and could not be used.
Additionally, and not specific to this hotel but frustrating nonetheless—the room could not be cooled below 19C as the thermostat didn’t allow you to turn it down more and the room got very stuffy.  The hair dryer is an old style version that you have to continuously hold the on button to get it to work and blows lukewarm air at best.
I was really looking forward to this hotel based on the pictures and some reviews, however there is zero service and the relative charm of the building is not at all offset but the negatives.",3,2022,05,07
100,Style over substance,"Overall our stay at Hotel Arena was comfortable but underwhelming. The hotel room itself was clean, with a comfortable bed but lacked amenities. Due to the design of the hotel it is very noisy at night and lots could be heard. A friendly receptionist called Sascha booked us in and was very accommodating, however informed us that a €100 deposit would be taken but refunded in full when we leave. Our travel adapter was broken therefore Sascha kindly found us two to borrow. On checking out of the hotel we were greeted by a less friendly gentlemen who informed us of a charge of €40 that included city tax and a mention of the adapters of which we had returned. We were obviously shocked at this as this was not explained at the start of our stay and we were informed we would get the whole refund. The gentleman was also unapologetic about the matter of miscommunication on their behalf. The location itself is nice and peaceful, however it is a bit of a trek in and out of the centre of the city each day.",3,2022,05,07
100,Lovely hotel...but....,"Beautiful hotel in a lovely location right on the edge of a park. We had a problem when we arrived as top floor attic bedroom was so cold (in April) that we had to requested a new room, a request that was met smoothly by reception. We had two rooms and the hot water in the showers in each room was dangerously hot. The only way to work it was to run the water in the hot tap in the sink! 
The final straw came when we, and many more, arrived back to the hotel at 10.30pm each weekend night, to find the beautiful bar closed and not even open to residents - not acceptable after paying close on €2,000 for a three night stay. 
In summary, a lovely hotel that needs some customer focussed management. 
In fact we never even seen a manager in the hotel during our stay. Hotel is beautiful but not at all customer focussed.",3,2022,04,30
100,Phenomenal hotel - our go-to when we visit Amsterdam,"We stayed in this hotel last week for one night. We had such an amazing time, it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The location couldn't be more perfect - it is right on Oosterpark. We rented two bikes from the hotel to cycle around Oosterpark at what was a very fair price. The hotel has a very peaceful yet still vibrant feel to it. 

The room was amazing - it had super high ceilings which felt luxurious and the bed was extremely comfortable and huge! The bathroom was what impressed us the most - his and hers sinks, a huge freestanding bath and a walk in shower. The hotel also provided bath robes, slippers and a variety of toiletries which we felt went over and above what other hotels would provide. The room also had a pod coffee machine which was great.

As we had stayed there previously, staff had left us a handwritten note, bottle of wine and chocolate in the room. This was the most exciting part of the hotel and it was the highlight of our entire trip to Amsterdam.

It is now our go-to hotel. Every time we visit Amsterdam, we will always stay in this hotel.",5,2022,03,25
100,lovely hotel in a wonderful location,"This hotel, located in a beautiful park is gorgeous. We stayed for three nights & enjoyed the sunny weather. The staff were lovely, the bed was very comfortable & we loved the fire pit in the bar. There are plenty of great bars & restaurants near by, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Also a great museum minutes away. Look forward to returning again.",5,2022,03,22
100,An amazing hotel,We loved our time spent in this magnificent modern hotel recently. Our room was spacious and beautiful. We rented bikes from them and had a blast with that! The staff were all very respectful and friendly. I had such a great time and look forward to returning some time soon. The park at the front i s a particular highlight!,5,2022,02,27

100,Beautiful Unique Hotel,"What a unique and beautiful hotel. It's right in a park and the outside looks like an old church. Our room had 2 floors. The main floor had a desk, bathroom and fridge then there was a set of stairs that brought you up to the bed. A little outside of the main downtown area but a nice neighborhood to have started my trip. ",5,2021,10,19
100,"Quality hotel, good location","Me and my brand new husband stayed in the loft of Hotel Arena on our wedding night and the day after. We really enjoyed our stay. Stunning room, very cozy and home-y. We had several of our guests staying as well. All enjoyed the hotel, and praised the characteristic interior. The buffet breakfast is good, our only recommendation would be to get a second coffee machine. The restaurant has a nice terrace for a drink, lunch or a quick bite. The staff seemed to be a bit inexperienced at times and therefore not always on top of their service, but not more than you could expect after the pandemic. The hotel is beautifully located in the Oosterpark, and close to plenty of fun bars and good restaurants in Amsterdam Oost. Hotel Arena will definitely be our go to for friends/family visiting from abroad or a lovely staycation in Amsterdam. ",5,2021,10,02
100,Wonderful location!,"I stayed at this magnificent hotel and it was relaxing since the structure is located in a park, large rooms equipped with every comfort. No details left out. 
Very professional and courteous staff. I'll be back. Very hearty continental breakfast",5,2021,09,10
100,Stylish revamp of a historic building,"First, there's location. The hotel is beautifully situated on the edge of a park, but also well sited for tram and Metro connections. Then there's the building- It's a revamp of a gracious 19th century religious institution which has apparently been through a century of many different uses. Now it's a hotel. We had a room which looked disappointing at first-at the end of the passage and a dark staircase inside the door, but once upstairs it was a light, airy well designed and spacious room. Very comfortable, and an excellent bed. The hotel is beautifully situated on the edge of a park, with a lovely view from the terrace in front of the restaurant. I can't really comment on the cuisine- we had breakfast which was good, and a few light snacks in the evening which were nothing special but OK-ish as an accompaniment to some drinks. Service was polite and efficient.
We had a couple of minor quibbles. The safe is at the bottom of the cupboard. Not easy for old knees. Our room overlooked the back of the restaurant kitchen. Some effort had been made to screen bins etc. from view but not enough. But nothing serious and I'd recommend this hotel unreservedly",5,2021,08,23
100,Nice hotel close to the center,"Stayed 1 night in the hotel, very nice refurbished old building with a long history. Despite all the Covid-19 rules our stay was made very comfortable. Nice breakfast as well as dinner served in the room. The rental bikes were also comfortable and we travelled in 20 min from east to west Amsterdam.
 The hotel is near the Oosterpark, nice to walk or enjoy the sun.",4,2021,05,15
100,Beautiful and stylish hotel close to the city center,"Me and my wife stayed in the Arena Hotel for a week during the Corona Summer in August 2020.
We arrived by car and had not trouble finding the hotel. The parking garage is directly ""under"" the hotel and is affordable and secure!
The hotel is located next to a beautiful park and a small skatepark - both were a big plus as we are avid inline-skaters.
The staff was super friendly and we felt very welcome and safe as every one was working with masks on and handgel for disinfection your fingers was stationed at every corner and lots of space to avoid fellow travelers.
The breakfast selection was really good and fresh but perhaps a bit limited.
A big plus was the possibility to rent bikes form the hotel for a fair price (not much more expensive then anywhere else).
The room was very stylish and comfortable, the bathroom a bit small but oh well.
Two things that bothered the us was a.) the hotel is really big and has several buildings and dozens of stairs and elevators. The walk from the lobby / restaurant to took an eternity and with all of our bags was a bit much.
The hotel definitely needs to work on repairing their aircons and elevators, as most of both were broken and did nor work which of course is less then perfect in the middle of summer with temperatures above 28 degrees.
All in all we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends.",4,2021,01,20
100,Amazing,"I had such an amazing stay at the Hotel Arena, the hotel is perfectly located in an amazing parc. The room is beautifully decorated and the hotel is perfectly clean it  might be one of the cleanest I've ever visited. The staff was very helpful and very attentive to my needs. I thank them for that specially with the actual Covid19  situation. I recommend this hotel for any kind of travel. 
PS: the breakfast was so good 😊",5,2020,10,12
100,5*,"Not a bad thing to say about this place. Staff were so helpful and kind. The hotel itself is a great location with walking distance to the centre. The way the hotel was done was exceptional. Our room had two levels with good facilities. Could not fault it. 
On a separate note, the park Restaurant was amazing. The staff, the food, the atmosphere was top quality. Truly one of the best restaurants I’ve been to for dinner and breakfast. Will be coming back very soon.",5,2020,09,15
100,Couldn’t fault it!! 5***,"I honestly do not have a bad word to say about this hotel, it’s STUNNING.

Upon arrival we were set to stay in the suite which on my behalf there was some confusion with the room pictures but the lady on reception went out of her way to switch this instantly to the room that I wanted. I didn’t manage to catch her name but she had lovely curly hair and needs to be recognised for her customer service level as she went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. 

The room was so special and the hotel is set on the most beautiful grounds. Every corridor, every ceiling, every staircase has a piece of history that you can instantly see. I also loved reading about the hotel in the guide in the room. We would hands down recommend to everyone!!

My only niggle was breakfast - I would of liked a bit more choice and maybe some things to be labelled as I poured some juice thinking it was a mixed fruits but it was grapefruit so I couldn’t drink it and I hate wasting things. 

But with that being said we ate and drank in the restaurant lots and couldn’t fault it! ",5,2020,08,13
100,Breakfast Buffet ,"Great Hotel with amazing staff, park view and relaxed vibes. The metro from Amsterdam Centraal takes you to the hotel within 15 Minutes with a 7 Minute walk. I started my day with a morning run through the Osterpark. ",4,2020,08,05
100,Excellent room and service,"Beautiful hotel with a great location (right on an amazing park)! Very easy walk to the city center and restaurants/cafes, though their own cafe was great.

The service throughout our stay was amazing (very helpful and welcoming). The room had a great view of the park and nice styling with comfortable furniture.

No hassles at all, and would certainly want to stay again next time.",5,2020,08,03
100,Amazing stay,Visited the hotel with a group of friends. We enjoyed the drinks on the terrace that has a great view over the park. Breakfast was very tasty. Option to rent bikes at the hotel was very convenient to explore the city.,5,2020,08,02
100,Amazing,"Great stay, would definitely come again! The location is amazing, right next to the park. Staff is very helpful and friendly and will also assist with anythjng you need. Breakfast buffet was great and the cocktails in the evening were very tasty!!",5,2020,08,02
100,Beautiful hotel,Nice and beautiful hotel. Very good location in the city park. Nice and helpful staff. Will definitely stay again. Food and breakfast were amazing. Rent a bike at the hotel and explore the city this way!,5,2020,08,02
100,Perfect hotel for a perfect holiday!,"My husband and I absolutely loved our time at Hotel Arena. Thanks to Iliona who checked us in to our room early :-) Beauty hotel with a lot of history, big rooms, amazingly comfy beds. Each room comes with a device you can take out with you with Maps downloaded onto it to help find your way around. This was a really lovely touch. The walk to the centre of town is just over a mile but it's a lovely walk with plenty of lovely sights along the way.

Thank you! We'll be back!

Xxx",5,2020,04,21
100,Amazing!,I have been to Amsterdam twice and stayed at the Arena both times! The view is amazing. It is a rarely quiet hotel which is nice for when you want to relax. It is about a 20 minute walk to the square and 30/40 minute walk to the central depending on your pace! It is an amazing place to stay if you want to visit Amsterdam for the views aswell as it’s other assets! The rooms are very clean and tidy. Has a very modern look to it at the same time as being chic! Great hotel with great staff too!,4,2020,04,06
100,Honestly the best place to stay in Amsterdam!,"Clean, perfect location, super nice treatment. Didn't have time to taste the food there but I'm pretty sure it tastes as good as it smells :)
Price-quality is perfect. You are close as well from tram and metro station.",5,2020,03,20
100,Dirty hotel,"Do your research before you book, don't get taken in by the hotel photos and price for a 4*. Hotel is so dirty, actually think it's the dirtiest hotel I've stayed in and I travel a lot. Room doesn't get cleaned daily. First room was duplex like with bed upstairs, tiny stairs, be aware if you are not mobile. Second room was an 'upgrade', smelled like strong pickled onions and was more filthy than the first but gave up by that point. Very far from center. Would not stay at the asylum again.very poor and not worthy of 4* rating at all.",2,2020,03,13
100,Beautiful hotel inside and out!,Stayed here for a few nights with my boyfriend and friends. Beautiful hotel both inside and out! Lovely park at the front aswell which is a nice walk in the morning. Rooms are perfect but be aware there are stairs! Staff lovely and friendly. Highly recommend!,5,2020,03,12
100,"Lovely Hotel, Great location.","Lovely setting in the park, tram stops 5 min walk away.

Restaurant/bar area extremely relaxing by the open fire. Staff very helpful and despite a small issue with our original room, we were provided with an alternative which was much better.

Would love to go back sometime. Really good trip!",5,2020,03,10
100,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is only a couple of miles outside the main city centre but has great tram links to the centre. It is situated in a big park and it is a beautifully renovated church with extensions. The restaurant and bar area are exceptional. The bedrooms are very well furnished and the bathrooms are great. 

The reason it didn’t get 5 star is because our room was a standard room but was a duplex so the bed was up a spiral staircase. It became abit tedious after a while and if anyone was fully mobile they would not have been able to manage. The other problem was there was nowhere in the room to put clothes in drawers and only about 5 hangers to hang clothes in the downstairs cupboard.",4,2020,03,04
100,Successful birthday trip,"We've just landed back home having stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. It's beautiful inside and out. Set on lovely grounds with only a short walk to the tram stop to take you to dam square (number 14). The staff were friendly and helpful, the bed was super comfy, our room was clean. Only down side for us we had food one night in the restaurant, we found the food not that great for the price, however we would 100% stay here again and would definitely recommend it. When we checked out this morning they gave us a little parting gift which was a lovely touch. Thank you for our stay hotel arena.",5,2020,03,03
100,Amazing time.,"Me and my boyfriend and our friends visited hotel arena and we had the most amazing time. Rooms were lovely, staff were amazing. Myriam was so lovely checking us in and out and she was so helpful and kind!! Would highly recommend this place. Thanks guys!!",5,2020,03,01
100,Fabulous hotel ,"Hotel is situated on the edge of a lovely park. 
It’s recently been renovated and has been done to a high standard, keeping all the period features. 
The rooms are clean. It’s quirky having a bedroom up the stairs but you need to be so careful as they are narrow, windy & slippery with NO handrail. We each had to come downstairs sideways, very slowly!
The food was of an extremely high standard. 
Staff were friendly and extremely efficient. 
A bit of a trek to the city centre but trams nearby. ",5,2020,02,28
100,Perfect stay,"A little romantic weekend getaway. 
Beautiful hotel, restaurant does excellent food, wine and beer. 
The staff were lovely and pulled out the stops to congratulate us when my boyfriend proposed. 
A really stunning modern, clean and stylish hotel.
Will be back!",5,2020,02,20
100,So much potential ,I will start of by saying the building itself and the surrounding area is incredible. It is situated quite a way out of the centre but with a tram stop so close it is not a problem and we even walked it most of the time but what was a massive let down was the cleanliness of the room it was disgusting I didn’t feel comfortable in there it’s like it hadn’t been cleaned in over a year which is so annoying because it could be such a great hotel just being ruined by what I would think is the basics of a good hotel and also two times staff walked in to our room whilst we where getting ready and early hours one morning and also at 8 o’clock one morning they rang the room and then put the phone down. Both times people walked into the room and they didn’t even knock and it’s annoying because I just always felt on edge and the noise of doors slamming and noises you can’t control like wind and rain which isn’t your fault but it just played a part and I couldn’t even sleep properly. overall it is a beautiful place with some of the biggest problems that a hotel of this standard should be perfecting. ,3,2020,02,18
100,Amazing hotel just outside the city,"Hotel Arena, is one of my favourite hotels I have stayed in. From the beginning it was situated in the park and therefore had beautiful views both in the hotel restaurant and from the bedrooms. The internal interior design and architecture was beautiful and the whole hotel was extremely clean with lovely staff. The rooms were large, spacious and again very clean. We had requested the ‘romance package’ and they staff had set the room up better than expected! What’s great is that check out is late (11.30am) but if you want to stay in longer you can pay €15 per hour for as long as you want.

The downstairs restaurant has a great range of drinks and the food was lovely too. I particularly recommend the cocktails and sit by the open fire, service can be a bit slow though, but the staff are very polite. 

If you are couple that likes to walk this hotel will suit you, it’s about a 20min walk to city centre but if that’s not for you it’s only €8-10 uber. Side note- to get into the hotel you have to go through the park not the car entrance. ",5,2020,02,17
100,Work trip.,"Despite our stay being that of a work purpose, I'd book this hotel for a personal visit also. The rooms are beautiful and unique, clean and spacious and the linen was dreamy. 

Breakfast was substantial and has a great selection on offer.

A great location situated next to Oosterpark.",5,2020,02,13
100,Beautiful Hotel,We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel Arena. The hotel itself is beautiful set on the grounds of a park. The room we stayed in was amazing! The rooms were so clean and set on two levels. The rooms are very modern with a modern bathroom including hairdryer! The second floor had a fridge - which is handy! We didn’t have the best view from our room but the views outside of the hotel certainly made up for this. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly upon check in and check out. The hotel is easily accessible from the centre of Amsterdam by the Tram lines that run close by! We absolutely loved our stay with Hotel Arena and can not wait to return very soon!,5,2020,01,29
100,"Never stay, again!!!","My original reservation does not include breakfast, but the hotel offered it nicely when we checked in, and I agreed to add.  Next morning, the restaurant rejected us, the reception charged it to my credit card, crazy? I had an important appointment, and I asked laundry service, but it was not returned in 48 hours?  I don't think this is Amsterdam standard, this hotel's service and responsibility is very very bad.  NEVER STAY.",1,2020,01,28
100,City break,"Hi Everyone me and my wife are staying at this beautiful hotel as we I write this! 

Firstly the room are excellent very clean and comfortable for all you ladies the hairdryer is good well my wife thinks so, they have a fridge and safe in the room. We are staying in room 71 the views are not the best from this room but you won’t even care believe me I can not fault anything, the staff are very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is right on a park and the view is stunning and if you like food the bar/ cafe restaurant is great and very well priced. 

Honestly if your thinking of taking a quick break to get away for a short time! You will not regret staying here!!!! Awesome 😎",5,2020,01,28
100,A Jewel in Amsterdam,"This hotel is relatively unknown in Amsterdam. We found it and had a most enjoyable four days. Breakfast is included. We ate here in the evenings with the food absolutely superb and an extensive bar to cater for every taste. Attention to detail in the rooms and staff very welcoming 
Easy walking distance, trams and metro nearby",5,2020,01,27
100,Amazing hotel,I came for my 19th birthday and had the most amazing time the rooms were so luxury and very clean the service at reception and at the bar was exceptional and if I were to visit Amsterdam again without a doubt I would choose here😁,5,2020,01,24
100,Great!,"The rooms were quirky, with two levels which was different but looked great! Hotel was very clean and beautifully designed. Only about a 25 minute walk into the city centre. Staff were helpful. The bar at night is lovely, with great views from the windows.",5,2020,01,24
100,BEST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN!,"I’ve never reviewed a hotel before but I had to review Hotel Arena, after everything they have done for myself and my boyfriend this week.  
The hotel itself is beautiful, overlooking a park and lake, and is incredibly decorated.  The bar is great and the food is phenomenal, but it is the staff that really impressed me this trip. 
When we arrived, we mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday, so the receptionist put us in her favourite room, which was absolutely amazing- so clean and beautifully decorated. They even helped me surprise him with breakfast in the morning, adding a lovely message and a slice of cake with candles, along with 2 complimentary drinks at the bar.  
On the first day of my holiday, I fell over and was unable to walk.  I came into the hotel very scared and upset, and the receptionist and other hotel staff got me a wheelchair and rang the hospital for me.  When I was back from hospital, they constantly asked how I was, even moving me to another beautiful room on the first floor so it was more accessible.  They did much more than I ever expected them to do, and never once made me feel as though I was an annoyance.  
To the hotel staff that helped me- thank you so much- you are a credit to the hotel, and it would not be what it is without your attitude and helpfulness. 
I cannot believe any negative review about this place as it is EASILY the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. 
I would only stay here when visiting Amsterdam and I advise everyone to stay here too!",5,2020,01,24
100,Stunning hotel - but with issues,"First of all I feel wrong rating this as average, because I did enjoy my stay and the place was gorgeous. But I feel it is important to highlight problems where they are, so the hotel can learn from errors and correct them going forward. So, starting on a positive. The room looks beautiful and the mezzanine is cute. The park is gorgeous and the location convenient but quiet. 

So issue 1) Cleanliness. I was disturbed on coming back to the room after a day out to see my bathroom bin had been emptied - but the bin bag itself was left on my sink, full of rubbish. This was really horrible and I understand mistakes can be made, but I have never seen in that in a hotel. It is unhygienic, for the price I would not expect something like that to happen. 

Issue 2) Design. While the room looks lovely, it is unpractical. The stairs are made of  a material that is very slippy and there is no handrail, so getting up and down can be a little difficult especially if you are carrying something. And I did have to carry something - the kettle and coffee/tea supplies! This was because while they were placed on top of the fridge there was nowhere to plug it in. Then upon getting upstairs, the water is in the tap downstairs, so back again and so forth. This is bad design. In addition, one night a light on the bedside fell out of its socket. Repairs are needed throughout the room. 

3) Service. For four stairs I would have expected better. Upon check-in there was no ""how was your flight"", no friendly welcome at all. The same upon leaving, we were not asked how our stay was or what could be improved. The most disappointing was we had paid for late check-out on our last day and were disturbed twice by a cleaner constantly ringing the door bell to come in. I told her one we have paid for late checkout. Then she returned as she had ""forgotten"" and did the same again. This should not have happened.

Unfortunately the cons outweighed the pros for me. I love the rooms and hotel itself though, so I hope these issues are fixed - then I would return.",3,2020,01,22
100,Hotel with a difference ,"A catholic school transformed into a hotel, great architecture super lounge and breakfast. quite steep stairscin mezzanine bedrooms, great service. well placed not far from the center. Facdd onto a beautiful park",4,2020,01,21
100,"Beautiful hotel, perfect destination with great transport links","We stayed at this hotel for three night. On arrival we couldn't help but notice the perfect location of the hotel, it was not too far from the centre but it felt very peaceful. All of the staff were very helpful. We upgraded our room for 30 euros a night (room 260) as we arrived earlier than the usual check in time, we were very pleased as the room was very spacious and clean. However after using the shower we noticed a bad smell in our room but once speaking with reception they were very understanding and willing to help resolve the situation. One thing we didn't mention was on the Saturday night of our stay at 3am in the morning we had an unusual wake up call of some rustling in our room by the side of our bed, however when we checked there was nothing there and when we spoke to each other saying ""Did you hear that?"" it stopped... and then we heard it again from the opposite side of the room. We looked up the history of the hotel and read that it used to be an old orphanage and nursing home during the war and this made us think that we could of had a visitor... Although we were spooked at the time it was quite a nice feeling and didn't worry us too much.

Despite this, we would definitely stay here again as all old buildings have their history. You can't really fault it, the warm fire in the restaurant really makes you feel at home away from home! Thank you Hotel Arena for making us feel welcome, we hope to visit you again in the future!",4,2020,01,14
100,Great hotel,Had a great stay is very easy to get to the central with no trouble the hotel was lovely and wonderful service everyone was very friendly and helpful I am looking to go back to Amsterdam this year and would definitely stay here again.,5,2020,01,13
100,European Holiday ,"We stayed at Hotel Arena for 3 nights. The hotel it well situated within walking distance to the city centre but far away enough to make it peaceful and relaxing. It faces beautiful parkland. It is lovely how they have made use of such a grand old building. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is good although slightly expensive. Our only problem was with our room. We stayed in a split level room. The bed was really comfortable and the room really clean. We found the narrow semi spiral staircase very awkward and inconvenient. At night the room seemed stuffy and overheated despite trying to readjust the room temperature ourselves. In fairness, we should have said something to the hotel after the first night but we did not. Also, the set up of the room was impractical. They had placed the electric jug on the fridge but the power cord could not reach the power point so we had to move it. There was a place in the wall for a television but the television was placed, instead, on a ledge upstairs near the bed. The hotel promotes its environment policy however they change the towels every day (we’d hung the towels up so they wouldn’t change them). As lovely as fresh towels are, it’s not environmentally friendly. We know this all sounds picky but for us it’s the difference between “Very Good” and “Excellent “. Please don’t let this deter you. We should’ve requested a different room. ",4,2020,01,11
100,New Years' Break,"We stayed in a suite (room 243) at the Hotel Arena next to Oosterpark in Amsterdam, for 3 nights over New Year. The history of the extensive building is interesting, built in 1888 as a Catholic Orphange and seeing various guises prior to being an hotel. The room was spacious and modern with a wonderful black and white brick-tiled bathroom, sitting area, iron and ironing board, fridge, safe etc.
The staff throughout the hotel and Café Park Restaurant were exceptionally helpful and friendly at all times, a real credit to the hotel. They also printed off our boarding passes for our return flight.
The hotel is pretty well situated with plenty of restaurants and bars around the Oosterpark area, and only a 10 minute walk to the metro station at Weesperplein. Trams to central Amsterdam go right past the hotel at regular intervals.
We had the breakfast buffet on our first morning and it was first rate, with great variety and real quality of food and drinks. A bit steep at 22 EURO pp, so make sure you get your fill, but it was really good.
On New Years Eve we had booked the full package (70 EURO pp) of 4 course dinner and New Years' Eve party in the historic Chapel. The dinner was exceptional (see photo of menu), and the service to match. Top notch!
We were more than a little apprehensive for the New Years Eve party as it was the 20th anniversary HedKandi party. As classic rock enthusiasts we thought we'd be the oldest ones there by 30 years, however the fellow partygoers were of all ages and backgrounds, just out for a good time. We had fun! Woop Woop!!
New Years Day brunch at Cafe Park was the highlight of our stay. I had the hangover cure brunch including a fresh oyster and shakshuka, while Jane had the resolutions variation with red curry soup, poached eggs and Waldorf salad. At 15 EURO a head the food was truly fabulous. The vibe at Cafe Park was always busy but chilled, with a lot of local families joining the residents to enjoy the food and atmosphere.
We did have a slight problem with the bill, being overcharged for breakfasts, but a couple of emails later, we were re-imbursed without any problems.
I would undoubtedly stay here again if we visit Amsterdam in the future.",4,2020,01,09
100,Customer service - Evelien,"Many thanks to the night manager Evelien who has been especially customer focussed and went out of her way to help after we left clothes hanging in our rooms wardrobe and realised when we returned home from our 3 day visit.  

Dresses all returned safe and sound to their rightful owner ... many thanks Evelien!!

100,Enjoyable mini break,"The hotel itself is set in beautiful surroundings and is well located for a visit to explore the city. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Suite which was a nice surprise. Our room was a loft conversion, very spacious with tasteful minimalist design. Overall we had an enjoyable stay, only slight down point was that it is near a main road which was noisey with trams/traffic, however we did request ear plugs from reception which helped.",4,2020,01,08
100,Got the vibe,"It had been many since I had been here. Before the remodeling. It looks so much better but the vibe is still there and it’s still good. Food is good too, service is unDutch friendly. Still a great place for a meeting or just to hang out.",4,2020,01,06
100,Soo good we are returning this month,"Stunning hotel, set on beautiful park with delightful views. Stayed here last March and due to be returning in two weeks can’t wait. Sad to see the poor reviews below hense my reason for leaving my late reveiw.. friendly helpful staff and security were brilliant, not too far from central a short and easy tram ride. Favourite part was the layout of the room and the modern but historical feel around the hotel. Can’t wait to return for my 30th birthday this month :)",5,2020,01,05
100,Odd hotel ,"When you first see this hotel you think wow this will be great. But those first impressions are not going to last. 

The building, the location along with the communal areas all look great and t looks very impressive especially with this historic nature of the building. But on closer inspection the rooms are very dated and needing a good refurb along with much better cleaning. The paint was falling off and the corridors are dark and cold, the room is a not suitable fo anyone barring a single person or maybe a couple as it's split on two floors with a inaccessible staircase which means you either have to take your luggage up or leave it on the bottom floor. There is no TV on the bottom bit so you have to lay on bed to watch anything and the room has clearly seen better days as there was things broken or not working. The room was also pretty cold. 

On the plus side it's got a good bar and restaurant
",2,2020,01,04
100,"Nice restaurant, disappointing hotel","We visited the Park restaurant several times and were very excited to stay at the hotel. However, our one night stay on Christmas day was disappointing. The room was dirty, especially in the bathroom. During the night there was some noise because of the main door of the hallway. Worst thing was that the bathroom and a part of the bedroom flooded when showering. We still like the restaurant very much. ",3,2020,01,04
100,Beautiful hotel - terrible service.,"Room wasn't serviced unless requested, broken glass found in bath, bed bugs, etc, etc. Beautiful building and grounds, a bit out of the centre but that is fine as trams are close by. Very disappointing for a luxury birthday stay.",1,2020,01,02
100,"Beautiful building, disappointing experience","During our 6 week holiday to Europe, this was one of the places I was most looking forward to staying. The room we booked online looked amazing, hence the booking, regardless of the price being a bit higher than we had booked elsewhere. We arrived by train, had a surly young taxi driver take us to the street, not the entrance which is closer to the park, but once we got to the right place the park/grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the building looked amazing. 
When we checked in they advised us that the lift we needed to access our room was not working, understandably this happens at times, however they pointed and gave us general directions to our room - this place is huge and it was like a maze,dragging our suitcases to the one working lift to go to our floor, up and down a few stairs, narrow corridors till we finally found our room. However not the room we booked from the pictures online - the bedroom was upstairs, a staircase that I'm sure would be illegal in Australia - the bathroom was downstairs and there was no where to put/unpack our suitcases except for the 2 chairs also downstairs. There was a kettle upstairs in the bedroom, even though the water was downstairs, a really poorly thought out design.
We went to the restaurant the first night, asked for it to be charged to our room, but because we didn't leave our credit card details on check in with reception, this was not allowed - we were not asked to do this otherwise we would have. We asked if we could have some milk for our room, and they said they didn't have any and directed us to a shop - in the dark on our first night there and we had no clue where to go - how can you have a restaurant and no milk? We also asked to borrow a corkscrew as there was not one in our room, again they used them in the restaurant but they didn't have one we could borrow!
The bed was large and comfortable, however there was no extra linen and no other pillows to choose from.
The next day we wanted to use room service for a meal but the phone did not work.
The restaurant itself is beautiful and the food was amazing, we ate there both nights, again a bit pricey but it is Amsterdam.
We found the reception staff a bit blase, not providing good customer service at all, on checkout they didn't enquire about our stay/whether we were happy etc and were quite rude regarding the use of the storage lockers while we had a coffee and waited for our taxi.
To top things off, when we left it was raining, there was a bucket of umbrellas near reception, no sign on them at all so I assumed that they were for guest use. I borrowed one and waited at the front lobby for our taxi-while visiting the ladies a girl from reception came and abruptly told my husband that the umbrellas were 30Euro each, not for guest use and only for sale and she took it away.
Having said all this, Amsterdam was a lovely place to visit, the hotel could be amazing if the staff were a bit more interested in their customers comfort and a bit more helpful - there are alot of places to stay in Amsterdam but unfortunately unless the customer service were to have a dramatic improvement this is not one that I would recommend.",3,2020,01,01
100,Thank you Myriam,On the whole a lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings we had a few minor issues but thanks to the receptionist Myriam things were delt with promtly. We would most definitely return. And thank you for your outstanding customer service Myriam you should be recognised.,5,2020,01,01
100,Disappointing hotel in Amsterdam,"The hotel is shabby.  It’s clearly seen better days.  Chipped paintwork , stains on the lift floor, bed base ripped, lights falling out, lights not working . The room I checked into was freezing cold.  Very disappointing .  We booked 4 rooms for two families and the rooms were scattered all over the hotel I.e not close together .  The rooms were booked well in advance so there was no excuse.",2,2019,12,27
100,Loved our stay here!,"This hotel is perfect for those who want the best of both worlds - a feel of exclusivity but accessible. Tourist locations are just a train ride away and some can even be reached on foot. Being located in the park, it gives a feel of serenity.

Our room is loft-type, which was a sweet surprise since we would normally see this style in beach resorts and not a city hotel. It was clean, nice, and very comfortable.

Service was excellent! The staff was very helpful and they would even accommodate our simple requests.

Food is also good although selection is limited. We especially liked the modern open fireplace, which gave us comfort when it gets cold due to the rains.

Will stay here again if we come back to this city!",5,2019,12,26
100,Simple things to improve ,"This is a large hotel in a good location and interesting history with access to the great transport systems in Amsterdam. The staff are friendly and the hotel bar and grounds are welcoming. 

Our room however was a first floor studio. The room needed a touch of paint and the cleanliness was below par. There was dust all around the bed frames and windows, and the floor was dirty. The bathroom had no hand wash or shower gel and the air conditioning was programmed to only heat the room which left the bedroom very stuffy at night and unbearably hot. To open the window meant having constant traffic noise. As well as noise outside, the walls were very thin and you could hear every conversation from the next room, every footstep and even peoples phone notifications. Additionally we were located right next to the main staircase which had people at all hours running up and down, again, being able to hear every conversation and noise. This resulted in both nights’ sleep being disturbed. 

In summary, the location is good and would probably stay again if the right room was available (and clean). ",3,2019,12,24
100,Great hotel on the edge of a beautiful park,"Hotel Arena is situated a good walk away from central Amsterdam, but very close to easy-to-navigate tram and underground systems. It sits next to a lovely park, and has a large open-air dining/drinking terrace overlooking the park. Rooms are very comfortable, staff always lovely, and the hotel's own restaurant very pleasant to eat and have a few drinks in. Certainly recommended.",4,2019,12,19
100,"Great stay, inexperiende receptionist",Great room! But i'm still awaiting the return of my money after the receptionist took it and claimed it didn't work and now i'm chasing my card company to get it back. Really frustrating and not what you need a week before Christmas!,5,2019,12,18
100,very good hotel,"very nice hotel only cleaning services should be better.we found glasses very dirty in our room, overall score is really good but if you want to drink something from glasses you have to make sure that was cleaned ",5,2019,12,16
100,Beautiful location,"The hotel Arena is a beautiful building in the park. The room was pretty and well furnished, but there was a noise during all night (we didn't sleep so well). We also found a dirty cup in our room at the arrival.",4,2019,12,16
100,Boutique Hotel in Park,"Hotel Arena is a lovely hotel with direct access to the park.  Many access points to the property makes finding reception an adventure.  The room we had was the loft which was historic, a great space and warm.  Access to the room was up two flights of tight wooden stairs and then up a very steep access stair into the room from the dor.  This makes handling large bags difficult.  If the effort is made the room is a great place to view the park with its own terrace.",4,2019,12,15
100,An absolute gem......,"I chose Hotel Arena because of its proximity to a concert we were going to and the good room price but it turned out to be an amazing place, I would definitely stay there again and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",5,2019,12,12
100,Review - Megan Law,"Great location, only a short walk to tram stations or a 25 minute walk into the centre. Super lovely hotel, it was super stylish and modern. All staff super helpful. Would definitely stay here again if in Amsterdam. ",5,2019,12,12
100,Don’t accept rooms in the 300 series,"Overall a nice hotel with good public transport to the center of town. Walk is about 30 to 40 minutes. 

Restaurant is ridiculously expensive but there are several nice, price worthy restaurants within 5 minute walking distance. Thaicoon is highly recommended!",4,2019,12,11
100,"Perfect hotel - good ambiance, nice and huge rooms and good location",Perfect hotel with a good ambiance. They have nice and huge rooms and it also has a good location. Friendly personnel and willing to help. Not too far from the city center and nice park around the hotel.  ,5,2019,12,11
100,Jordan Breen,Stayed December 8th TIL 10th. Boyfriends birthday ruined by how dirty the hotel was. He was even laying on the blood stain. Damp ceiling. Tissue in toilet brush. Pubic hair on the floor. Hand marks on the bathroom glass wall. Yellow all in the sink. Very noisy. Could hear everything outside of the room. Even when standing in the bathroom can hear someones conversation. Would not recommend to anyone.,1,2019,12,11
100,"Good place, but nonody tidy up my room","The rooms were small (very small) in two levels... upsrairs were really Difficult to go, stairs very unconfortable, we went just once, probably the frontdesk telephone was there... we came back late and we found up that room was still to be tidy up, our towels were dirty over the floor, and in the bathroom, maybe all glass can be beautiful but i went with a friend and it was not good to listen to eachother, event door couldn’t be locked (the toilette)
When i complained in the frontdesk, a coffe was offered to us, absolutly not enough!!! Too expensive for what we had...",3,2019,12,09
100,wonderful stay," beautiful architecture and decorations with a fusion of classic and modern. very special room with indoor stairs. great for couples. restaurant with high quality food. only downside is that the soundproof of room wasnt very good.",5,2019,12,07
100,good services,"pleasant hotel with kind helpful staff, the food in the restauarant is good. the  furnishing and design is a little bit gloomy. particularly the passages were dark. 
Arena is situated on short distance of public services.
",4,2019,12,06
100,Such a pity!,Hotel looks great after the remodeling. Such a pity that my room was really dirty (toilet had been used and not flushed!) and the person at the reception desk didn't even look at me and say goodbye or asked any questions around my stay! . Im not a fuzzy person but that made me think about the cleanness of the room. ,3,2019,12,06
100,"Historic Hotel, Nice experience","We loved staying at the Arena - Historic building with updated amenities. Cozy bedroom, beautiful hotel in front of a park. Very close to the museums (Moco, Van Gogh and Rijsksmuseum) and hop on hop off bus. ",5,2019,12,04
100,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel was very impressive walking up to it in the park and the decor inside. The room we had was lovely with a bathroom and lounge area downstairs and the bedroom upstairs. The bed was very comfy and we was very relaxed here. However we could hear noise from the people next door to us and the floor had not been cleaned and if it had then not very well but these are the only issues we had, other than that a lovely hotel for a couples weekend break. ",5,2019,12,04
100,"Excellent, clean, cosy hotel","We could not recommend hotel Arena more - the hotel is stylish, cosy, clean and very reasonably priced. The location is very close to the centre by tram and the park outside is lovely. We were very surprised by how modern and clean the hotel was as we didn't spend too much for the couple of days we were staying. The bar/restaurant area is incredibly warm and inviting with an indoor fire pit and beautiful furniture. In the hotel rooms, there are modern bathrooms and showers and everything is clean and in working order. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for travellers who are looking for a reasonably priced place to stay that is also clean and comfortable.",5,2019,12,03
100,Take me back!,"Unreal hotel, Amsterdam in general is incredible. The decor is lovely, the staff were pleasant and professional, I was surprised how good everyone’s English is! 
The room we had was lovely, the bed is by far the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in! The bathroom had a tinted glass wall you could almost see through from the bed, which I thought was super cool. The shower was amazing too, powerful and extra hot water, everything you need in a bathroom and bedroom really! 
Only flaw I can say about the hotel is the walls seemed a bit thin, as I could hear people down the corridor or upstairs, but it wasn’t particularly a busy hotel so it wasn’t a constant issue and didn’t ruin our experience/sleep.
Location was perfect, in the more residential area of Amsterdam, it was about a 20min walk to all the bars etc, but there’s trays everywhere which is super easy we got a two day ticket for €13 and made the most of it it’s so handy! 

SAD TO BE HOME! ",5,2019,12,02
100,Favorite Hotel Ever,"This is a must see must sleep in Hotel, truly amazing design and not to forget the buildings history. Fantastic area of town with a big park beside. I will continue to come back time and time again. Thank you Hotel Arena!",5,2019,12,02

100,Impressive hotel,"Beautiful residence tucked away with stunning views and location! Staff are lovely and friendly and the rooms clean and modern with period features.
The breakfast was great too! So much option. Just a short walk to Oostport to some local shops bars and restaurants and bike hire :)",5,2019,11,29
100,Absolutely loved my stay,The hotel is beautiful. We stayed in a standard room that had two floors. We were absolutely blown away with the room and surroundings of the hotel. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. When I come back there is no doubt in my mind that I will be staying at Hotel Arena. Cannot recommend it enough for a couples hotel and it’s only 3 stops away from the central Amsterdam. ,5,2019,11,28
100,Wow!,"What a beautiful hotel!!! I couldn't recommend it more - fantastic location, so clean and very well thought out. Staff were lovely and food was great! I'd try the park burger - it was cooked to perfection. Couldn't recommend more.",5,2019,11,27
100,Trip in Amsterdam,"Nice location in the park but need to walk/public transport to go in the center. Nice room but not perfectly clean (walls, area close to the windows in the bathroom). The restaurant was really nice we had a great time. ",4,2019,11,25
100,"Lovely stay, great hotel!","The room was so nice, little a cosy apartment! Very clean and the bed was really comfy! Hotel was in a good location, only a couple of stops away from Amsterdam square so was really easy to get anywhere. The furthest we had to travel was to and from the airport and that was only 30-40 on public transport, 15-20 minute car or even 30 minute walk. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel whether your a couple or with friends. It was friendly, welcoming easy to get around and was really good to look at too, inside and out! 
Check in and out was quick smooth/easy with no problems at all. ",5,2019,11,25
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam - Great stay!!,"Regarding the hotel it was perfect, large rooms, lots of towels, efficient cleaning and most importantly a really good bed! The metro was about a 5/10 minute walk away which may of been an issue if the weather was bad but fortunately we was lucky with good weather for the weekend.

Staff were pleasant on arrival and they were very efficient and checking in and out. I received an offer for room upgrades prior to arrival and then also asked on arrival which I was not interested in. This could be off putting to others which is my only bit of criticism.

   ",5,2019,11,25
100,"Great location, grounds and aervice","Situated in Ooster Park in a former church this is a special place. This is our third visit to Amsterdam...love everything about this city. We have stayed at the Tropen the last two times. Tried the Hotel Arena. We had a small issue with our first room. The recovery service we experienced with Tristan and also Evelyn was so incredibly good. They more than corrected our issue (stuffy room with a temperature issue) and did it was the utmost professionalism and kindness. At midnight we called down to the front desk and in 10 minutes later Tristan appeared...he was dressed in a suit, had diagnosed the problem and came with a solution. After he completed his shift he ensured his colleague Evelyn was completely up to speed. She carried the torch with perfection and smiled through all of it. We love you guys and your service skills have made Hotel Arena our new home away from home. After 38 years in customer service at an executive level (sorry just for perspective) you two could train anyone in any company on service that keeps customers forever. ",5,2019,11,23
100,Fab,"Amazing hotel, comfiest bed iv ever slept in!! Not far from the main tourist parts of Amsterdam but far enough that it’s not loud and busy at night! Reception staff are very helpful and the rooms were amazing. Perfect for a weekend break away;) we will be back and have recommended the hotel to a lot of friends and family.",5,2019,11,22
100,"Really cool, interesting place to stay","Fairly clean, split level property with comfy bed and tea/coffee making facilities. All you could need for a short stay. Safe in room which was a nice touch. Loved the fact it was a converted orphanage. The hotel felt modern but also had touches of character. Would definitely stay again. good location just outside of the city centre. Easy to reach transport only a short walk away from the hotel.",4,2019,11,20
100,Beautiful interior and exterior!,"The hotel is stunning, the staff are so friendly and helpful. Especially the woman with long braids in the bar/restaurant area. It’s a great location, easy access to transport but also in a neighbourhood away from all the tourists. I am IN LOVE and will be coming back!",5,2019,11,20
100,"Good location, beautiful building inside a park but not value for money","Great location, hotel inside the park and great hotel cafe/restaurant. But room was not up to standards of 4 star hotel. Room was not very clean, bathroom door did not close, there was a sound from the ventilation and heating only through air-conditioning which was loud. In terms of products they only offered an all-in-one shampoo in the shower. Not the most comfortable place I’ve stayed in and relatively expensive.",3,2019,11,19
100,Great staybin Amsterdam,"Nice and comfortable room, good value. Great bed. Design was trendy. Only too cold the floor.
Not far away from the center. You can go on foot o çr bike. Good access by tram. Nice location in a park  I would return if I come back.

",5,2019,11,17
100,Great stay!,"Great hotel near the center of Amsterdam. Beautiful rooms, great restaurant and breakfast. Great atmosphere  in the hotel (old building, stylish). Location in the park is great, we had a great morning walk. The hotel is near several highlights of Amsterdam.",5,2019,11,17
100,Realy nice place for a holiday!,"The hotel was realy nice. We had a pleasant stay in a superior room. The heating in the room was good, but the bathroom was realy cold. The breakfast was very good. But it would be better when the price would be the same paid in hotel or booking.com (17,50€ in Hotel ; 22,00€ in booking,com)",5,2019,11,17
100,Great stay,"Outside of inconsistent towel service and some mild dirt/dust in corners of the room, my stay was great. Service was impeccable anytime I needed something, and the bed was amazingly comfy! I will definitely be back. ",4,2019,11,16
100,Average,"Rooms noisy, design oké, maintenance / cleaning low prio. Coffee oké.
Breakfast oké. Staff have fun which impacts the service.
Value for money, no, to expensive.
Hotel design and location is oké, 15 minute walk to the Center.",3,2019,11,16
100,Trip to Amsterdam,"We have had 3 wunderful days in the Hotel Arena in Amsterdam. The Service was very friendly. The Hotel is direkt at a large and interestin Park, godd for walking and fitnestraining.We will come again to this Hotel",5,2019,11,15
100,Nice birthday break,"Booked this hotel on last minute for my boyfriend’s birthday. I didn’t know much about the hotel before choosing it but came to find out afterwards that it is situated in a park and used to be an orphanage and then a nursing home and is rumoured to be haunted.

First impression was lovely. The hotel has a a grandness about it. The room we were given was nice. Bed is comfortable and bathroom was clean. The location of the hotel was great as well. There are 2 tram stops very nearby but we walked everywhere as it only took about 15 minutes to walk to the center and it’s a great way to see the beautiful city.

My only disappointment with the hotel was that I’d rang ahead wanting to arrange something little for my boyfriend as a surprise. The lady I spoke to suggested balloons and I thought that was great and asked them to be in the room for when we checked in. Upon going up to the room, there were no balloons. I was hugely disappointed as the lady I had spoken to on the phone seemed enthusiastic to help me. Having said that, I went down to the front desk to let them know of my disappointment and the gentleman apologised and offered to have breakfast and balloons brought up the following morning. This definitely made up for it as the breakfast was lovely.

All in all, the hotel was lovely and if it weren’t for the initial disappointment I would give it 5 stars.

Oh and as for the hotel being haunted, we consistently heard light switches being flicked but it was too near to be somebody else’s room and always happened in threes. We woke up during the night as the tv had switched itself on and a radio channel was playing, despite the remote control being over on the table. Also on the shower screen, the letters ‘I C U’ had been written out. I can’t say it was particularly unnerving though. Very much enjoyed our stay. ",4,2019,11,14
100,Hotel with history and character,"This hotel is steeped in history and has such a unique architecture. Rooms are quite varied, as we were staying with another couple and their room you’d think they were staying at a different hotel. 
The check in process was quick and easy, although the staff were a little blunt.
Our room unfortunately didn’t have many working plugs which made charging phone and using hair straighteners a challenge. There was also no mirror anywhere near a plug socket which made straightening hair very difficult. 
Breakfast was very good quality and lots of selection for all types. 
Check out was simple and the locker storage is perfect if you plan to stay and go out into the city.
Location wise, it’s a 10-15 walk from the centre of Amsterdam so I’d definitely recommend this as a good base for couples. ",3,2019,11,13
100,My experience in Hotel Arena,"Lovely hotel , clean room , friendly staff , beautiful garden outside the hotel , location is nice , have to walk around 10 min to nearest tram station , but I still would recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam",4,2019,11,13
100,Wonderful stay in Amsterdam,"Hotel Arena is a trendy and delightful hotel, set in a beautiful park and attached to a lovely restaurant.

We were given a larger room than anticipated which was a wonderful surprise for our first anniversary. We opted to have breakfast in the city but the drinks we had at the Park restaurant before we checked in were delicious and the service was excellent.

The staff were helpful and the hotel is well laid out with the option to stow luggage in lockers ahead of check in which proved very handy for our early arrival.

The hotel is well situated, easy walking distance to the centre. Or very accessible by public transport for nearby metro and tram stations are only a short walk away. 

I’d thoroughly recommended this hotel, it’s a great base for exploring Amsterdam. ",5,2019,11,12
100,Great stay - I recommend!,"modern and design hotel with high level of comfort. Very well located, quiet area, in an amazing and very relaxing park  - 15min by tram from the city centre, several tram lines 5min walking from the hotel. ",5,2019,11,12

100,Filled with character,We loved the fact that the hotel was situated on a beautiful park. Great place to do your morning exercise before tucking into the fantastic breakfast on offer. The building was built in the 1880’s and is full of history. Easy walking distance to tram and metro and lots of interesting streets to explore in the area.,4,2019,11,05
100,Week end en amoureux,"A perfect week-end with my wife, the hotel where realy good, from the check-in to check-out.
The team is amazing and give a very good service. The location of the hotel is a bit far of the center but ok with Uber :-) ",5,2019,11,04
100,Weekend Trip,"Perfect location to have a short weekend trip to the city of Amsterdam. Near to the centre of the city, the zoo and directly next to a beautiful park. Starting the day with a walk/run is therefore a good option to choose.",4,2019,11,04
100,Nice but expensive hotel outside Amsterdam central,"I went to this hotel some years ago and it was amazing. Now i was a bit dispappointed. Paid parking, very expensive room, not renovated bathroom (mold) 
A bit outside the city Center. The hotel in general needs to be refeshed. Breakfast is very good. ",3,2019,11,03
100,Cool hotel in lovely historic building,Hotel in set in a park 15mins from city centre- very cool and spacious but some of the rooms are split level which looks great but very impractical and stairs are so steep. Bed was very comfortable and slept very well. Breakfast was expensive in hotel but there are plenty of good places around to eat. Park setting is lovely and transit into centre is quick- we walked in when weather was dry. Hotel bar and restaurant were lovely and the terrace area when the weather is dry was great. Would definitely really recommend but request a different type of room.,4,2019,11,03
100,Just a perfect stay!,We had an excellent night at arena hotel. The room was big and cosy. The Hotel has a great atmosphere. The check in and check out have been really easy and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel. The bar and restaurant looked amazing!,5,2019,11,02
100,Amazing hotel in a beautiful park,"In a very quiet location and beautiful park outside, where me and boyfriend ended up getting engaged!
I planned the trip as surprise for him and the Hotel arena reception team were so helpful in organising balloons and drinks for arrival, and even gave us an upgrade to the most amazing room, with a jacuzzi bath!
The high ceilings and perfect decor make it the most peaceful place ever.
The food in the bar is also amazing and the staff are extra friendly! Couldn’t fault the place at all, we would go back in a heartbeat! 
Thank you again for making the weekend so special for us, we’ll never forget such an experience!
We can’t remember any names but the ladies on reception on that weekend are all an asset to the hotel, and a nice guy from London in the bar.
We really appreciate your help. We’ll be back! ",5,2019,11,01
100,Amazing stay at Hotel Arena,"We went there with two young kids (4 & almost 6). Right next to  a park and amazing play park. The hotel and it's facilities look great and we had a very relaxing stay - sitting by the fire after breakfast, dinner, a long walk round the city.  Staff are really friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back . Breakfast was great value as children under 6 eat for free.",5,2019,11,01
100,Dirty and smelly room. Food and restaurant amazing.,"My bedside table was sticky with glass ring marks, some sticky drink from previous users . Bathroom had a bad smell, glass doors were very dirty, the ceiling was very dusty, floors dusty and at times even the corridor smelled sewage? The room had no water, no mini bar,  no toiletries. I was surprised for a 4 star hotel. At least the bed, sheets and towels were clean.",3,2019,11,01
100,Probably the nicest hotel I ever visited,"This Hotel is located in a very beautiful & calm park. The hotel is situated in an old monastery like building that adds a lot of charm! The hotel is modern/trendy, but still fits the whole monastery theme. There is a very nice cozy bar/restaurant that feels very welcoming. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is also an underground secured parking lot for an additional charge that is comparable to other car parks in the neighbourhood. Very close to the city center, so you can go by foot, or if you prefer public transport, there is a tram spot at around 200m from the hotel. The room I had consisted out of 2 floors, bathroom & small living space at the bottom and the bed on the top level. Overall a very comfortable stay in a nice and trendy hotel. I would book this hotel again in the future!",5,2019,11,01
100,Hotel arena,Great hotel location. In the middle of osstenpark. Beautiful with wildlife children parks water fountains. Accessibility great as tram routes just round the corber to travel wherever you fancy. Walk through the park and only moments away from a strip of shops you could explore forever. Hotel excellent along with cafe which is beautiful and trendy and welcoming all at the same time. Colleagues all friendly polite and willing to answer any questions you may have. Brilliant experience! ,5,2019,10,31
100,Conference trip,Excellent! I will stay again when I go to Amsterdam. Location was convenient for walking to city center and Institute of Applied Science where I attended a conference. Had best meal in Amsterdam in the Park restaurant. ,5,2019,10,31
100,Hotel Arena,Lovely hotel located a few minutes walk from transport links into the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms very clean and quiet but could do with upgrading pillows to ensure a perfect nights sleep! Milk and a few biscuits in the room would also be very welcome alongside the coffee and tea!! ,4,2019,10,31
100,Awesome stay !!,Had an awesome stay at Hotel Arena. Would defo recommend to anybody travelling to Amsterdam. Friendly and helpful staff That made the stay even better. Favourite spot was sat around the open fire. Overall a great hotel 10/10,5,2019,10,30
100,Arena in the park,"Very good hotel, great location. 10 mins from the centre. Lovely grounds, lovely hotel. Bit pricey for a g + t other than that everything ok. Nice and cozy bar for the evenings, great if you have children as it has a park next to it. 
",5,2019,10,30
100,Very nice charming boutique hotel,"Beautiful hotel next to a park, in a quiet area. The restaurant / bar are lovely to have a drink or dinner There is a parking facility for € 35 per day which is very convenient in Amsterdam. It is not very close to the city centre but it was all right for us since we like to walk. It's probably possible to take a tram but I haven't checked it.",5,2019,10,29
100,2 nights stay,"After walking from central station we decided to jump in Uber cab, €8 we were quite impressed by the visual presentation of this hotel, a quick check in and we were booked in 204 on the 2nd floor, the room is huge mainly white decor with a stunning black tiled bathroom with a walk in shower, the bed was comfortable with a tv at the end with a decent channel list . 

The distance to the Dam is about 6 stops on the tram , or walk it in 45min , you are away from all the major attractions so walk or tram in, the stop is 500mt away from the hotel , you are placed on the outskirts of the city ! 

Our last night was spoiled by other residents being really loud from 12-4am this was dealt with hourly by security staff 

A radiator in our room decided to fill up with water at around 7am for an hour , so not much sleep !! 

The hotel kindly showed some compassion by apologies and provided us with a free buffet breakfast which was plentiful 

The dining area is very nice serving meals throughout the day and evening, we did not eat here but the food and drink prices look reasonably priced 

Clean hotel,  nice staff a little bit on the edge of the city , would have been nicer if closer but prices would be more too !! 

",4,2019,10,29
100,The room was great!,"The room was so great and the atmosphere was good.
However, the elevator was broken and I felt inconvenient.
The breakfast was good because the time was set longer.
However, the price was a little expensive.
The atmosphere was good because the hotel was refurbished church.",4,2019,10,29
100,Room,"Decoration of room let down the overall excellence of this hotel.
Wonderful location in the park and first class staff ,such a pity that cleanliness in the bathroom and overall state of the room let it down.
Bed very comfortable and linen spotless
",4,2019,10,28
100,Excellent price quality,Hotel recommended by an agency turned out to feel like a 4 star hotel in terms of quality and service. Room designed on two floors with bed upstairs which gives u a feeling of space - does not feel you are actually at a hotel. Restaurant is really nice and offers good selection.,5,2019,10,23
100,First trip to Amsterdam,The room was comfortable.  The service was fine.  I liked the convenience of having a nicer place to eat on the property.  The breakfast provides a nice variety of items form to choose.  The park provides a great view.,5,2019,10,23
100,GREAT PLACE - ALMOST PERFECT,"Everything was great. The location inside the park is a big bonus and something unique. You can easily walk to the center of Amsterdam (30 to 40 minute walk) and go through the channels. Food was tasty and there were good drinking options. Another good thing is that you have access to a tram station just 50 meters from the Hotel entrance.
The only issue was that we received an upgrade to the Loft and you have to go up through really steep stairs with your bags. One of the guys at the front desk helped us get our bags up, but no one helped us getting them down even though I asked for help. They said they don't do that. So I had to get down two 50lbs bags through really narrow and steep stairs.",5,2019,10,23
100,Beautiful Hotel Atena,"We stayed at the hotel Arena last weekend and had a great time there. The hotel is very beautiful and original with its architecture and decors. Staff was very friendly and helpful, we definitely recommend this location both for leisure and for business purposes. ",5,2019,10,23
100,Business meeting between predominantly tourists,"We had a business meeting including sleep-over. Staff at check-in, meeting room and restaurant friendly and professional. On par meeting room - fit for purpose. Hotel rooms duplo, still quite small. Rooms were warm;airco gave warm air instead of desired cooling. Lots of tourists but no obstacle for staying here at a casual business meeting",4,2019,10,23
100,Best place to stay in Amsterdam.,"Unique, spacious, charming place located in beautiful park. Proximity to public transport and ZOO. Great choice of delicious food for breakfast and dinner, no need to reserve places. Disco in chappel.",5,2019,10,21
100,Great Hotel1,"When I first booked this hotel, the booking was accidentally canceled.  The hotel worked with me to get the hotel rebooked at the same rate as the original booking.  I was so appreciative of their help.  When we got there, we were very impressed with everything about the hotel.  The front desk was excellent - helping us with everything we needed.  The room was beautiful, and the amenities were great.  I liked the idea of the smart phone supplied in each room. The phone included hotel information as well as info on everything one would want to know about Amsterdam.  Because of how it was set up, one could take it out and use as a smart phone map to get around the city.  Although we didn't have time to do any exploring, we will definitely keep this hotel in mind for future visits.  I sent all the hotel information to my travel agent as she often books people to stay in Amsterdam for a few nights before boarding cruises.  ",5,2019,10,21
100,"Fabulous place to stay just outside of Amsterdam Central with easy access via Tram, Metro or Bike","Loved the hotel, very friendly, clean and welcoming. Great location with access to more historic and relaxing parts of Amsterdam, yet still close enough to be accessible to Centraal. Sitting on the edge of an active park where runners, cyclists, fitness programmes and tennis activities are all taking place. If we were to head back to Amsterdam, we would look here first !",5,2019,10,21
100,Nice Hotel,"The Hotel is not near the center of town.  Be prepared to walk a lot and/or take transportation to get around.  However, the Hotel is clean, comfortable, and located within a nice section of Amsterdam and within the entrance of a park.  The staff is friendly and helpful.",4,2019,10,21
100,"Cool Hotel, Great Location","cool hotel with great facilities and a beautiful restaurant with a patio. Staff were very friendly. The only reason they get 4 stars is because the main elevator was out of commission during our stay, which made it a tad of a hassle to get to the room. Also, there was no ""business center"" in the hotel, so no place to take calls/get on a computer if need be.",4,2019,10,21
100,An excellent hotel in Amsterdam,We have stayed one night in this hotel after one entire day of visit. The service for the check in was really good. The staff was very nice. The room was also really good with lots of facilities inside and clean. We highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2019,10,20
100,Worst experience ever,"Just want to say it was truly the MOST DISGRACEFUL, the RUDEST and MOST UNPROFESSIONAL encounter I have ever experienced!!

This all started as I misread our arrival time to Amsterdam from 12am to 12pm. we arrived 12hrs earlier than we expected at 12am mid night... It really was a stupid mistake by me.  

When we arrive to the lobby, the receptionist was being really friendly to other customers, joking and laughing to them, where we thought “Great! People in Amsterdam are really friendly” But when we were being helped you can tell right away there’s something off. 

The receptionist did not greet to us nor a single smile. While I was trying to explain the situation to him and asked when will be the earliest time we could check in as he started to laugh like how can you make this kind of stupid mistake, despite not being helpful at all.  Then he stated normally will be 3pm (which is very standard for most of the hotel I know) then I wanted to find out if there’s any room for us to book just for the night? Where he replied “it will be very expensive at €269” Yup I understand that’s the price you have to pay for last minute hotel room. But then I further asked if it’s possible to check in a bit earlier if the room is not occupied, he checked and says “we have to wait till 7am and see if anyone book the room, if not then you can have the room at 7am.” Which me and my wife thought ok, we can wait 7hrs and see how it goes.

 So we put the luggage away in the locker and waited in the waiting area with not a single person there part from us. We were just using our phones on the couch with our earphones on. 15 mins later one of the receptionist came and told us we can’t stay here and have to leave! We were very shocked and wondering what the reasons was?! then he said “this is not a bedroom where you can wait so you have to leave and we are closing soon”, where we explained we are not planing to sleep here we are just using our phone quietly trying to stay away from the rain outside but they insist we can only come back at 7am or pay the €269 so we can stay and have a room!

I mean, is this how you treat your customers?Kicking them out in the middle of the night when is cold and raining outside! Really?! Not to mention it’s our first time in Amsterdam and we had no idea where we could have go! we then ask for advice on anywhere we could go, where they just shrugs their shoulder and simply don’t care. 

While we were trying to search online on where we possibly can go, there were few more guests arriving and the receptionist were really polite and respectful. That made us wonder if being Asian was the reason why we been treated differently?!

My wife and I were walk around in the middle of the night when it’s raining, trying to find a place to stay dry and warm.. but soon realize that all places closes at 3am..  so we were sitting in central station in the cold where we feel really unsafe as we don’t know the area and there was a lot of drunk people. Finally at 4:30am we couldn’t stand the cold and decide to head back to the hotel where we had to beg them to let us stay in the corridor (not even the waiting area) as we had already tried everything we could.

Then the receptionist finally tell us he made a mistake and we won’t be getting our room at 7am as he mistaken to different room type. So we can only check in at 3pm.. that’s 15hrs wait time!! If we knew this from the start we would have just paid the €269 instead waiting!! This is when he sarcastically said “like I said, if you pay the money I can check you in right now!” It was almost 5am where was just not justified for the price anymore. So we stayed at the corridor till 7:30 then left for breakfast and trying to enjoy the city as much as we could with over 24hrs no sleep. 

It was the worst experience I have ever encountered but luckily the morning receptionist were much more respectful. now we still need to stay here for 4 nights hopefully it won’t happened again",1,2019,10,18
100,Beautiful with a Few Issues,An incredibly beautiful hotel. Everything about the hotel is stunning from your initial view of it walking into the park from the lobby to the room. Our only issue was the shower in our room created a massive puddle in our bathroom that extended out past the shower stall. We also found the original windows charming but not practical as at night time the single pane windows allowed for all of our street-view noise to come right in and keep us up. ,4,2019,10,18
100,Very interesting history,This hotel has a very interesting history which makes the stay there even more enjoyable. The hotel is very central and within in a short walk to the tram station. As it is situated on the edge of a very beautiful park it does not feel like you are in a major city.,5,2019,10,18
100,NO GD 3 Star HOTEL,"We booked here bcos of the adoring lake photo and it shown a decent lobby with chic design. However, the room is extremely bad in terms of acoustic, totally like 2 star hotel with poor door and floor rating. The staff replied this is old building but the door and raised floor shouldnt be old.   The fridge doesnt work and smell bad. The room finishes are dirty and not in high standard as a claimed 4 star hotel.  The high rating are totally cheating ones. With decorated lobby only, bad inside. The only window also dirty.
Bathroom layout setting and low ranking to the minibar.
The entrance forced to get in from park side also caused location worse than expected. About 10 min walk if walk to nearest metro or tram station that going back to city center. 

Disappointed and ruined somehow to my birthday trip.",1,2019,10,16
100,Come for a drink but not for a stay,"Pros:
Hotel grounds and bar were beautiful. Definitely would recommend to come for a drink and enjoy the fireplace, ambiance, and view of the park. 
Cons:
Not worth the price you pay to stay. Would not consider this a 4 star hotel. 
Rooms have a very awkward layout with no room to put a suitcase, or move around. 
Front desk was not super friendly or helpful when we asked for availability for a room change. 
Safe deposit box did not work. 
Bathroom had an unbearable smell. 
Extremely stained and dirty window curtains. 
Saw bugs running around on the floor.",2,2019,10,15
100,excellent hotel.  We will return,"Nice Hotel with big and well equipped rooms. Well located, near public transportation but also at walking distance from main attractions.  Good restaurant with good atmosphere and food.  
No fitness room, no pool but if you want to keep your training programe you have a very nice park just outside.
",5,2019,10,14
100,Fabulous hotel! Would recommend.,The hotel looks stunning and has a fabulous interior. Beautiful bar and restaurant with gorgeous open fire to sit around and enjoy a drink. The room was massive with high ceilings and bed was comfortable. Overall a fantastic stay! ,5,2019,10,14
100,Good location,"The hotel is very clean and the staff was very helpful. The room was good sized and had everything needed, It is in a good location, only 3 blocks from the tram and within walking distance of several restaurants. Also it is located on a large park good for walking or running.",4,2019,10,10
100,Fancy place for city hoppers,The building is quite interesting and impressive - seems to be a former factory. Therefore the ways are a bit long. The rooms are really fancy and comfortable. Everything was clean and worked. The personell was nice and friendly. For walks or some sport there is a wonderful park in front of the hotel. I really can recommend this place. It's not very central however well accessible by tram and metro. ,5,2019,10,09
100,After work drinks,Visited the hotel for after work drinks and impressed by the surroundings and decor! The drinks and nibbles choices were fantastic and we enjoyed spending a few hours here! Shana served us and is an asset! 👍🏻,4,2019,10,08
100,Amazing Hotel,"Amazing Hotel. It's in a great location, the layout is incredible, the rooms are superbe, and the staff is so helpful and friendly. The design is beautiful as well. Would definitely stay again, no hesitation.",5,2019,10,08
100,A fantastic place,We spent a very good moment at the hotel. The park around is fantastic and the location perfect :calm but around the center. Rooms are clean and design. We spend a good moment on this place very peaceful. ,5,2019,10,07
100,An Amazing Place,"I was so blown away once I arrived at Hotel Arena.  It is within walking distance or tram distance to everything you would like to see whilst in Amsterdam  The restaurant and bar are exceptional, such a comfortable place to hang out.  The buffet breakfast was delicious. The character of the Hotel is a mix of old meeting new, with beautiful surroundings and a creative interior.  All the staff were very professional and accommodating.  We felt so lucky to have found this place and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",5,2019,10,07
100,business trip,Had a great and comfortable stay at this beautiful hotel and location. The hotel is easy to reach by car or public transportation and within walking distance from other great sightseeings in Amsterdam.,5,2019,10,07
100,Hotel Arena great stay,Hotel Arena’s charming park setting makes for beautiful stay in Amsterdam.  Our room had 20’ ceilings and a modern design. The hotel’s restaurant is excellent.  It’s location just outside the old city provides a quiet respite to the otherwise Amsterdam touristy noise. Great value beautiful location.  ,5,2019,10,06
100,Lovely hotel,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday, and we were both made up when we arrived. 

Location, theme and decoration were perfect. We travelled into the city centre every day which only took 10 or 15 minutes and was super easy. 
",4,2019,10,05
100,Not worth the money,"Nice layout of the hotel in an old orphanage in a not so fancy part of Amsterdam. Rooms are by far not so shiny as shown on website. Quite noisy (street, ventilation, next room), dirty and they lack of love. I slept directly under a wlan-router... I'm sure Amsterdam has much better rooms to offer.",2,2019,10,04
100,A special hotel,"The hotel is great in every way. Located in an area which is usually less targeted by tourists but full of peculiar spots. The structure of the hotel is particular too, does feel like being in a renovated church with a contemporary design touch. Rooms are spacious and clean too.
Price is good for Amsterdam
",5,2019,10,03
100,Boutique hotel with an awesome breakfast space,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hotel Arena. All the rooms seem to be very different (I had many a colleague with me so we all compared) and they felt boutiquey and modern. I loved my upstairs lounge with velvet couch :)
The breakfast choice was brilliant and the space felt cosy with a gorgeous fire taking centre stage as you enter the restaurant. I'd certainly recommend!",4,2019,10,03
100,Average,"Average hotel, too big to establish a privilege relationship with customers. A bit like a factory, with minimal services, nice but not so competent staff.
Waiters are laughing together with their smartphones while you wait for your plate..",3,2019,10,03
100,Good fun,"The rooms are pretty amazing. I wouldn’t make the mistake of going with stairs however as they’re extremely difficult to walk down, we changed to a room with a garden. Location, 5 mins from a tram route to get into Dam Square. Restaurant was great. ",4,2019,10,02
100,A good choise,"Excellent choise if you want to stay in town for a couple of days. It is a bit expensive, mas has a good location. The staff are very nice. The breakfast has a lot of choises, it was the best breakfest I've ever had",4,2019,09,28
100,Sparse but clean in a wonderful park setting,"The area was quite nice,
located at the edge of a park. We received a room upgrade, to a loft bedroom which was nice if one did not mind climbing steep steps up to the comfy bed. The bathroom was a bit dark but the amenities were very nice. 
The windows opened which was a big plus, along with having a refrigerator and coffee machine. The restaurant was tiptop! Delicious food and a fantastic place to relax in front of the fireplace and enjoy one of the local beers. ",4,2019,09,27
100,peaceful ,"hotel is near the park and from the restaurant you have the view. rooms are very large, nicely minimalist decorated. staff is extremely nice. every thing is thought and designed practical. the tube in the bathroom is a very nice bonus",5,2019,09,26
100,Fantastic hotel,"Spent 3 nights at Hotel Arena. Absolutely amazing place. Great sized room and brilliant amenities. Staff were very friendly too. Its a little out of the way from Central Amsterdam, but we'll worth the short tram ride. Only small niggle is the floor in the room could have been cleaner..it certainly wasn't a deal breaker. Would go back and highly recommend. ",4,2019,09,25
100,Not great ,"Hotel appearance is lovely and the staff seemed nice.

It was hard to sleep as the hotel is noisy.  Noise from adjacent rooms, noise from the corridor, noise from upstairs noise from the water pipes. I don't think any money was spent on sound insulation. 

The room had little natural light as only one rather small window. 

The bed was unreasonably soft and 2 singles stuck together is not acceptable if not being sold as a single or twin room.

Breakfast buffet seems expensive but was alright. ",3,2019,09,24
100,Carol's 60th birthday tour,"We stayed for 2 nights. Room was clean, comfortable and well equipped. Would highly recommend. Beautiful position on the edge of the oosterpark and close to tram stops and canals. We visited the Heineken experience, Zaans Schanse and enjoyed a canal cruise.",5,2019,09,23
100,"Relaxed, Comfortable and Quirky","We stayed at Hotel Arena for a three-day weekend break to celebrate our anniversary. We arrived late in the evening due to a flight delay, but this was no problem at all for the front desk who were expecting us and booked us in promptly.

The room was gorgeously quirky, with an upstairs mezzanine containing a huge bed, and a lovely sitting area downstairs and large wet room. It really had the wow factor when we first walked in. On closer inspection, it could have done with a little touch-up (walls scuffed, some stains on the curtains) but this wasn't a problem and the room itself was very clean. We thought it was a bit odd that, given there was a seating area there was only a television upstairs, but again this was personal preference.

We made the most of the amenities on offer over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Hotel - particularly enjoying the sun in the guest courtyard with a glass of wine after a day of sightseeing. We ate at the restaurant twice, once for brunch (a la carte, not the buffet) and once for dinner. Both meals were very tasty and reasonably priced.

The setting in the Osterpark was just beautiful - we were also fortunate to have fantastic weather so made the most of the park. It was a lovely antidote to the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam Centre. 
On the edge of the park there are a number of really good bars and restaurants within walking distance, so you don't have to venture all the way into central Amsterdam if you want a meal/ drink out.

It was around a 30 minute walk into central Amsterdam (very pleasant, past the Botanic Garden and zoo) or you could hop on a metro and be at Central Station within 15 minutes).

All in all, this was a solid offering with a relaxed luxury feel (but none of the unnecessary pomp you might expect from a 4* hotel). It was perfect for a relaxed anniversary weekend!",5,2019,09,23
100,"Fancy place to , modern set up in historical building","Very nice refurbished Hotel, very centrally located and next to lovely park. Good food and nicely decoratet restaurant. Stayed there 15 years ago for the first time when it was more of a simple hostel. Huge improvement since then, well done!",4,2019,09,23
100,Beautiful and cosy Hotel,The Hotel Arena ist very cosy and furnished in modern design. It's located perfect for a city trip to amsterdam. The staff was over all friendly and helpful. The only struggle we had was the missing option to open a window in our room. I really prefer fresh air instead of air conditioning. ,4,2019,09,23
100,Very good experience,"Very nice hotel which is located in a calm area with a beautiful park integrated with the hotel.
Facilities did fully live up to our expectations and we will most certainly be looking forward to revisiting the hotel one day.  

",5,2019,09,22
100,Nice stay for one night.,"Had a nice stay in a really beautiful hotel. Right at a great park. Rooms are really good, some can use a little maintenance but overal good. Personel is helpfull. Great breakfast in buffet style, alot of choice. Overall a fine hotel to stay.",4,2019,09,22
100,Great find in Amsterdam,We loved our stay at the hotel arena. Walking distance to the city centre. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Hotel has loads of character and the rooms are lovely. Beds very comfortable. All in all a great visit. We will definitely be back ,5,2019,09,22
100,"Quirky, quaint, and high quality","Apparently, this used to be an orphanage, so the structure & lay-out is not like a typical hotel and takes a little time to get used to. Also some of corridors are quite dark...That being said, we had a beautiful and quiet room with a large bathroom. Beds are very comfortable. The bar is busy and lively with excellent service. Breakfast buffet is great with many (Dutch) delicacies. An added bonus is the adjacent park - good for a stroll after breakfast.",5,2019,09,21
100,Fantastic hotel,"We have stayed in Amsterdam many times but this was the first time we stayed here.  The rooms were really well presented and very large and the service was great.  
We l will definitely be back. The park is amazing.",5,2019,09,19
100,Love this hotel but it needs improvements,"I fell in love in Hotel Arena after my first stay there for my birthday trip to Amsterdam in March, 2019 with my best friend, so I decided to gift my boyfriend with a trip to AMS and a stay at Hotel Arena for his birthday this month. I've noticed that despite of how hard the hotel's management works to make the place beautiful, elegant, and cozy, some things are lacking, need improvement; specifically, when it comes to the rooms, and not the exteriors of the hotel. Our towels were picked up, but not replaced, the hairdryer was nearly broken, the shower cabin is done in such a way that it's nearly unavoidable to prevent water from leaking out of the shower on to the bathroom floor. Some of the front desk ladies respond to your questions regarding the hotel and its services as if you inconvenient them with your silly inquiries. The breakfast seemed less good and rich in variety this time around. My boyfriend had a hard time selecting something that would be Kosher for him other than pastries. Despite all these minor things, I still love this place and plan on staying there again in the future. I informed the hotel that this trip to AMS was a gift to my boyfriend for his birthday, so they left a hand-written birthday note for him and a card for two complementary drinks from the cafe downstairs. So sweet!",4,2019,09,19
100,Good stay in nice area of Amsterdam,I booked through the hotel website. Nice structure with a history and the chapel too. My room was big enough with a very very big bathroom with jacuzzi. Excellent service overall and lovely park around,5,2019,09,19
100,A real gem!,"Whilst spending a few days at the IBC conference, I enjoyed a stay over at hotel Arena. Beautifully set in a quiet area overlooking a park and close to public transport, the friendly staff impress with their efforts to make your stay remarkable. The breakfast is generous, fresh and very good. I was lucky to enjoy “the loft suite “ which is situated in a separate classy building. The room perfectly harmonises modern design in an 18th century setting, high ceiling with beautiful wooden structure.
When next time in Amsterdam, that’s the place I will be!",4,2019,09,18
100,Luxury hotel,Lovely place to stay to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of Amsterdam with a great view while enjoying the privacy of a surrounding park which also offers many activities. The restaurant is very chic with delicious food           ,5,2019,09,17
100,Fabulous,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay. The building is beautiful inside and out and located in a lovely park. Took us 5 mins to walk to the tram stop or 25 mins to walk to the centre. 5 mins from a supermarket and really cheap off licence. 
We upgraded the room as it was minimal extra after adding breakfast. The room was lovely. Especially the bathroom with the roll top bath and skylight window. Breakfast was very good, a great selection including fizz! The restaurant/bar area was vibrant yet tranquil and a lovely place to chill out. We didn’t eat there but the snack bits off the menu were great. Would be loathed to stay anywhere else if we visit again. ",5,2019,09,16
100,All show- little substance.,Beautiful hotel and staff.  Service was mixed and not great.  I had problems with staff inefficiency at the front desk and breakfast.  The hotel interiors were beautiful and the beds were super comfortable.  Expensive with a beautiful park location and great looking restaurant. ,3,2019,09,15
100,Great Find!,"We chose Hotel Arena for it's location and price.  Easy access to city centre on the tram and good pricing.  The hotel more than met our expectations.  The breakfast was fresh, good variety and well laud out.  We had dinner in the Park restaurant the first night and were blown away by the meal.  My husband decided his burger was the best he had ever had (and he is a burger fundi!) and my lamb was superb.  The French toast with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream was to die for! We will definitely stay again next time we visit Amsterdam.",5,2019,09,15
100,Amsterdam property gem,"Very professional and  courteous staff.  Clean, modernized and attractive rooms and facility.  Great quiet location yet accessible to all of Amsterdam.  Nice garden and park views.Would certainly return on any future visits.",5,2019,09,14
100,Very Nice Hotel!!,"The hotel is really Well located in a beautiful park.
The rooms are comfortable and well decorated (nice and cosy)
The staff is professional, nice and helpful. 
Special mention to the breakfast !!! I Would definitely come back.

",4,2019,09,14
100,Gem of a hotel,"Loved this really quirky hotel which is a bit out of the centre. Our room was a split level which was a bit of a challenge sometimes!
It was reasonably easy to get to, straight out of Centraal station - go to the left for the number 14 tram then it’s a 10 minute walk through the park to get there. 
I’d like to have had breakfast there but at 22 euros per person the price was a bit steep - hence the 4 stars
Would highly recommend this if you want to visit but like getting away from the centre for a bit!",4,2019,09,12
100,Very nice and atypical hotel with a beautiful decoration and comfort,Hotela Arena is a grat palce to stay in. You will enjoy this very special place very well located. Rooms are organized on duplex and the use of space is very clever. The breakfast is great with a lof of fresh products.,4,2019,09,11
100,Lovely hotel,"The building is amazing, and from the looks of it, rooms don’t tend to be the same.
Our bathroom was inside one of the done towers, which was lovely.
I do feel like a few more complementary items should be included. Fridge had nothing in it, bath robes should be standard, etc. They did have a nespresso machine in the room, which is a nice difference. 
Staff were lovely during our stay. We did have to ask a few times regarding public transport, other amenities etc, so if you are planning on staying here, I would do some research about the area and how to get to the city Center, as the hotel does not provide any information or welcome packs.",5,2019,09,07
100,"Great Stay, Highly Recommend!","Beautiful hotel & the lovely Oosterpark is right on the doorstep! There’s a good restaurant downstairs with delicious dinner & very warm and welcoming staff. Food allergies are taken seriously. Good location not far from tram stops. Rooms have a little fridge which is handy if you want to keep fruit, berries, etc.",5,2019,09,07
100,Excellent,Service was very good. The room was excellent. Location was perfect for us. The restaurant was good and the staff very kindly. The garden front of the hotel is very nice and excellent to take a walk and sit down.,5,2019,09,07
100,Good hotel in a park,"We had a very good stay at Hotel Arena for three nights.  The bed was super comfy, the reception staff were really helpful, and the breakfast was good.  Our room was a split level with a really steep staircase, no problem for us,  but people with mobility issues should check about single level room availability when they book. Hotel is close to tram lines 5 to 10 minutes walk, depending which one you take.  Convenient to all parts of the city.  Tram journeys took no more than 10 mins to access various parts of the Central canal areas of the city.",4,2019,09,04
100,Weekend Break,"The location and setting of the hotel is perfect, the staff were helpful and friendly and the room was above expectation. it was just a shame that we didn't have longer to actually enjoy the hotel's facilities fully as on a hectic weekend sight seeing visit. Always something going on in either the hotel or park but still a relaxing laid back atmosphere.",5,2019,09,04
100,Great place to stay in Amsterdam,"Hotel Arena is really a great place to stay in Amsterdam from many perspectives: site location in a large and beautiful park, at walking distance from City centre. Lovely building style, bedrooms with bed on mezzanine with view on the park; excellent breakfast with nice fresh food, nice staff, etc.!",5,2019,08,29
100,Interresting Hotel concept,"Cool Location (old historical place, fomer children´s home for difficult to raise girls... but we encountered no ghost so far :-). In the middle of a park, so ideal for children! Rreally nice staff, cosy place! We´ll come back! ",5,2019,08,28
100,Hotel Arena - a great place to stay,Lovely location with good rooms and excellent service. The hotel is to the East of the central city and only a 15 minute walk into the heart of the city. Close to multiple tram routes if you want to walk less. ,5,2019,08,28
100,Avoid the Loft Rooms,"This hotel has excellent staff, is in a wonderful location, provides a reasonable quality breakfast and the restaurant bar area is a very pleasant place to spend some time. The room however was a shocker - a loft room that had angled beams you had to duck or bend around, a glass panelled wall that I ended up taping a piece of paper to so my wife did not head butt it, and being on the roof the room was subject to the weather, which for us was when Amsterdam broke all the heat records. I did not see the other rooms and so cannot comment.",3,2019,08,25
100,Ok Hotel at best ,"Got back from a 3 night stay last week. Hotel is in a nice location next to oosterpark. Staff friendly no problems there. Rooms are not very good very small and the bed is in a upstairs loft up a very narrow stair case, not very ideal but it is what it is. Food is appalling we went down for some breakfast was told there was a buffet 22 euro each and it was the worst selection of food iv ever seen, cold beans a few strawberries and a croissant. Absolute joke so we swerved that and went out elsewhere. Other food on offer throughout the day was nothing to rave about either quite a poor selection.
However like I said was in a nice location and friendly staff make it a ok place to stay. ",3,2019,08,22
100,Very nice hotel but...,"Hotel is really nice, location is great because of the relaxing park and staff was so kind and helpful, but we had a bad surprise in our room when we arrived: we found drops of urine on the toilet, brush toilet was dirty, no soap in the shower and dust on some furniture. We would not recommend it because of its lack of cleanliness.",3,2019,08,21
100,Cool but odd hotel,"The renovated old building has a great cool factor and the staircases are beautiful.  The standard room was quite a surprise as the desk, luggage rack and bathroom are below and the bed is on a loft above with access via a narrow winding stair.  The room was comfortable but getting up to use the restroom at night felt a bit risky.",4,2019,08,19
100,Perfect for friends,We booked Hotel Arena for our best friends hen do for the long weekend. Despite being a little out of town the location really makes the hotel unique being within the park. The hotel is very cool and contemporary with lots of characters features. It was a nice vibe/good sign that the restaurant and bar were busy during the day too. I'm sure we'll be back!,4,2019,08,19
100,Nicest hotel in Amsterdam,i have stayed in Amsterdam so many times I've lost count but this is best hotel I've stayed in rooms are lovely and modern while hotel rests on a beautiful park.i normally have trouble sleeping in beds in hotels but this was really comfy too,5,2019,08,19
100,Your choice,"Nice hotel with majestic style and look. Front desk is a bit in the back, but its no problem finding it. It is more hard to find the entrance it self. Signs are hard to see and the entrance is inside the park. Nothing more to say about the hotel other than it is super nice and staff that are very helpful ",4,2019,08,19
100,Nice but with a lack of room maintenance,"nice place to stay, quite and in a beatuifull park around.
good situation in the city
good restaurant, fresh breakfast
possibility to rent bikes for visiting 
walls painting and finitions in rooms were not fresh.

100,Amsterdam Gay Pride,The town was packed because of the Gay Pride. But the hotel was nice. Every room is different. The Chapel is an outstanding event-location. And the park in front of the hotel makes it very relaxing. Great location alltogether. ,4,2019,08,15
100,Very nice property with great setting in park and not too far from center,"Nice hotel in remodelled historic building on the edge of a city park.  Very nice restaurant, bar and patio which is family friendly.  Some rooms face the road and can be very noisy so need to watch for this when rooms are allocated and ask to change rooms if you can see the road.

100,Lovely,"Great location, convenient, and lush. I will definitely be looking to stay here again next time I am in amsterdam. I booked on hotel tonight, so I got a great deal and ended up in a suite on the ground floor. ",5,2019,08,12
100,A paradise hotel,This a hidden gem of Amsterdã. It's a lovely place that looks like a 5 star hotel. The Park is a big surprise and the room is really good. It's a short walk to many transportations. There are markets and restaurants nearby,5,2019,08,11
100,Perfect hotel,Perfect hotel in a very nice location in Amsterdam. We loved the old style of orphanage refreshed in too a new hotel at the Oosterpark. Nice drinks in the evening at the bar with a good view to the park.,5,2019,08,10
100,Wonderful Hotel,"This is a really comfortable hotel with a great staff and convenient location. The facilities were very complete and we loved having the 24 hour snack and drink bar in the lobby. We didn't try the restaurant other than a coffe one morning, which was also excellent.",5,2019,08,08
100,Waw.. amazing hotel,"If you get chance visit this hotel.. amazing place and close to everything in Amsterdam.
Food is good. Rooms are clean and comfortable.
Staff are friendly and very helpful.
Beautiful park right outside the door.",5,2019,08,04
100,Stay at another hotel,"This hotel is in an old Catholic orphanage, very nicely situated in a lovely park, but not so well situated for Amsterdam. We had a good dinner there, but the menu was very small.
That is all the good I can say about the place. 
The receptionist had little patience or knowledge of the city. There was no help with our luggage, even for us elderly ladies.
Breakfast was sparse for a 4 star hotel, little choice. 
But the room ........ absolutely no privacy in the bathroom. Only shampoo and hand washing liquid, no other toiletries.
The beds...... the bases were narrow and the mattresses were some 10cms bigger, so if you sat on the edge you were liable to fall off, even worse was rolling out of bed during a restless night.
Weve been travelling this year for three months and this was the worst hotel. Nothing major....except the bed bit, but I’ve been to Amsterdam on several occasions and there are many much better hotels.

100,Amazing hotel,Hotel was lovely😁 staff went above and beyond. Would definitely stay here again❤️ gorgeous park at hotel you can just chill on the bench when you come back from the hustle and bustle of the centre. Was about a 7 minute walk to the metro and 3 stops to city centre so could be in central in about 13 minutes. ,5,2019,08,03
100,Beautiful historic hotel,"Lovely hotel right in the park with very good customer service. There was a drainage issue in our bathroom shower but otherwise this was a fantastic hotel, I would highly recommend it.  Loved the snack option at the front desk, great for tired starving travelers.",5,2019,08,02
100,Amazing hotel in a wonderful location,"Sitting on the edge of Oosterpark, Hotel Arena is a great base for a visit to Amsterdam.  Rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated.  Staff can not do enuugh for you and the general décor in the hotel is lovely.",5,2019,07,31
100,Lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel. Love the idea of letting guests have the free use of a smart-phone with unlimited data to use around the city.
Nice bar area with outside seating. Good views of the park and pond with the resident herons :-)
Friendly service. Lovely room on split levels.",5,2019,07,30
100,Good,"Hotel was lovely very clean, although if you order a drink in the bar it takes about 15 minutes to come. Very polite things are a bit expensive in the hotel and not much on the menu to choose from out of the bar.",4,2019,07,26
100,excellent hotel in a local neighbourhood,"The hotel itself is located in a quiet area on the east side of Amsterdam, surrounded by a largely Dutch community. It has a a number of cool restaurants and bars within a few blocks that have a welcoming vibe (would recommend Maxwell's, just south of the hotel). The hotel staff were very helpful and always happy to answer questions, they offered bike rentals as well as information and passes for the public transit system as well as recommendations for place to visit or eat at near by. The rooms are very different to rooms you might see in North America but still very nice and kept clean. The hotel itself is beautiful, looking like a modern, sleek, minimalist palace, but for some might take some time to navigate. It is an amazing spot if you want a refuge away from the busy tourist areas but because of that does require some planning when it comes to going sightseeing or visiting different locations. ",5,2019,07,24
100,Unique hotel in a great location,A very unique hotel in a building with a lot of history.  Location adjacent to Ooosterpark was great.  Restaurant was limited and no breakfast available other than buffet--although I never actually saw a buffet--and quite a walk to any other restaurant.,4,2019,07,24
100,Hotel Arena - a unique place to stay,"everything was absolutely without problems, friendly people, great service and mainly the most AMAZING location at the park which I really liked and enjoyed and hope will come back again one day, thank you!!!",5,2019,07,24
100,great trip,"The staff was helpful with everything over & above what would have been expected . . . we didn't have cell phones, so they checked flight status, printed boarding passes, called taxis -- anything we needed.  Then to top it all off, they let us know we left our camera, even before we realized it was missing!  The park was a fabulous touch, the lounge was very nice, the hotel had interesting history, and the room was very comfortable.",5,2019,07,22
100,So brilliant,"Really beautiful rooms (seriously, stunning), great staff, winning location. Could not recommend more highly - we had the best stay. Breakfast is a tad on the expensive side though - maybe consider going out to explore the city for your morning meal.",5,2019,07,21
100,Good stay in Amsterdam,"This is a most agreeable hotel with a lovely terrace and bar/restaurant overlooking the very pleasant Oosterpark. Service, staff, room cleaniness and quiet all top notch and serve with a warm welcome.  ",5,2019,07,20
100,Good but some glaring issues,"Me and my wife visited Amsterdam this July and decided to stay at the Hotel Arena as it looked beautiful from the photos. It was great to be so close to the park and easy enough to just jump on a tram and get anywhere we needed. However there are some issues we had, even though the room we had was stylish and very nice the cleanliness left something to be desired. Upstairs there was a odd smell coming from the carpet on one side, almost like old feet smell. On our 2nd or 3rd day we noticed my wife’s pillow was disgustingly stained! (See photos), the members of staff resolved this quickly however its one of those mildly horrifying things to find and it was simply shrugged off how upset we were about it. The day after we also got back late to find out room hadn’t been cleaned, again the staff did help us when we went down to speak to the reception, and we went out for a walk as things were cleaned up. But I don’t think we were the only ones with issues as whilst there another couple were also complaining about an issue they were having with cleanliness (not my place to say what as it isn’t my complaint)

All in all the place is lovely but there are some cleanliness issues that for the prices we were paying I don’t think should have been an issue.",3,2019,07,20
100,Nice hotel in green area,"It´s a really nice, young and chilled Hotel at the corner of a park. Well runned with a nice modern and chilled Restaurant. The facility has atmosphere with a lot of younger, friendly people (we are about  60 years old). We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,07,18
100,Superb hotel within walking distance of the centre,"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hotel Arena as your place of stay when visiting Amsterdam. It's a short trip into the centre, either by foot or tram. The hotel itself feels really grand and luxurious. The bar/restaurant is a really nice place to spend an evening, and it overlooks a lovely park, which is great for an evening drink on the terrace. I think what makes this a really nice hotel though, is the staff. All members are extremely pleasant and professional, and they really go out of their way to make your stay special and memorable. I will definitely be returning to this hotel next time I visit Amsterdam.",5,2019,07,17
100,Beautiful Park Situated on Hotel Doorstep.,"My favourite part of this stay was how close I was to the park. Unfortunately the rooms were too noisy. Because of the steep, wooden steps leading up to the bedroom, you could hear both neighbours trudging up and down them in the middle of the night as if they were in your own room. Despite the comfy bed, it was too noisy to get a good nights sleep as the rooms are split level, they are so tightly packed in so you can hear everything. It was about a 35 minute walk to Vondelpark",3,2019,07,17
100,Excellent hotel in beautiful location,"Wonderful hotel in an old restored building in an ideal location - adjacent to city park, just outside city center, and close to the University of Amsterdam. Staff were very efficient, friendly, and accommodating. Would recommend highly. ",5,2019,07,15
100,Trip with the grandson,"All over I was very satifies, the third stay in the Hotel, very nice after all the reconstructions.
Good Location to get into the City an all the interesting Place you could find in Amsterdam .
Looking forward fot the next stay",4,2019,07,14
100,excellent location,"well situated in a lovely park. easy walk from metro therefore access to everywhere. pleasant walk to Rijksmuseum, Albert Cuyp markets. friendly and efficient staff. larger room than usual in Amsterdam. Bonus was a full bathroom including a free standing bath and separate shower",5,2019,07,13
100,Wonderful birthday trip,"I stayed at the Hotel Arena from 9-11 July (my birthday was on the 10). This has got to be one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at in Amsterdam and I’ve been around 11 times! The interior was so breathtakingly beautiful  and the welcome from the hotel staff was first class. They were all so friendly and helpful when I checked in and out. 

The room I stayed in was amazing. So clean and the bed was supper massive.  It could easily have fit 4 or 5 people on! It was super comfy too. I had a really good view of Oosterpark which was an added bonus as generally you tend to get views of dingy buildings or car parks! The bathroom was nice and clean and there was a mini fridge in the room to keep your drinks in. The surroundings of the hotel were nothing short of awesome. There is the restaurant which has al fresco dining/drinking and the beautiful park to take a stroll in. It was all so blissful and peaceful, the perfect setting for a birthday getaway.

As for the location of this hotel it was super easy to get to and not far at all from the centre as most reviewers have said. As you come out of Centraal station the tram stop is right in front where you get the number 14 going to Flevopark. It’s only 7 stops to Alexanderplein and a short walk from there.

I would highly recommend this hotel and definitely intend to return next year.",5,2019,07,12
100,Lovely Hotel,"We had a lovely stay, we stayed for 4 nights. The room is lovely and spacious. The area where the hotel is located is beautiful, parakeets flying around in the trees and also a lot of herons. We did have a couple of problems, the aircon being one, unfortunately it stopped on our secon night and we struggled to sleep, informed reception at half 3 and someone at that time came to look at it. Unfortunately they couldn’t do anything until the morning but was helpful enough to provide us with a fan. I also believe the rooms could be cleaned better, we had a lot of cobwebs in our room, the gap between the mattress and the bedside table had a LOT of dust, under the sofa the same. I also found that around the sink and the shower cubical was very yellow and unfortunately the toilet brush was stuck in its container. Overall our stay wasn’t ruined by any of this and the hotel is well worth the money.",5,2019,07,11
100,great weekend stay at hotel arena,"We stayed here for 2 nights July 2019. I cannot fault the hotel or the staff. There are trams running near by and we found it simple to navigate them to get around. We did walk into the centre 1 day which took 20 minutes. 
Our room was split level, immaculately clean and modern decor. the bed was super comfortable too! Beautiful park right on the doorstep and a great peaceful retreat after a day in the busy centre. Thank you Hotel Arena!",5,2019,07,09
100,Beautiful Setting in the Park,"A lovely hotel right in the park.  Bring your running shoes or rent a bike. Convenient to the tram and metro too.  About a 35 to 40 minute walk to the Center City. Modern, stylish bathrooms.  The room I had had the bed upstairs and a pleasant couch and desk on the first floor.  Perfect for a little work on business. Stairs in the room were very steep -- I would not recommend this particular room for elderly or the very young. ",5,2019,07,09
100,A dream of a hotel,"A wonderful place to stay at. Beautifully set in a lush city park. Well-designed rooms. Exquisitely decorated and furnished. Delicious food. Wonderful service at every level. Not cheap but for what you get, absolutely worth it. ",5,2019,07,09
100,Friendly hotel,"Nice hotel situated at the edge of the Oosterpark in a quiet neighbourhood not too far from the city centre. Not advisable for people looking for a Hilton-like stay, but fine for those looking for a friendly and more ecological hotel. ",4,2019,07,08
100,"Lovely setting, comfortable bed, substandard facilities","Hotel Arena is set in lovely Oosterpark, and in summer it’s just gorgeous, with birds & bicycles & sunshine. Taking coffee and/or meals outside is delightful. But the rooms are appropriate for only solo travelers due to bathrooms whose design offers no privacy at all. (Our cleaning & maintenance were terrible, but perhaps that was an aberration.) Fortunately, the beds are quite comfortable, and that counts for a lot!",3,2019,07,07
100,Beautiful location away from city center,"I stayed two nights here. The hotel is three stops on the metro from Central Station, then about a ten minute walk so if you have a lot of luggage take a taxi. It is in a renovated orphanage and the renovation has been well done, with plenty of interior details preserved. The hotel is on the edge of a park with views from the terrace over a small lake. My room was spacious and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but very clean. The breakfast buffet in the hotel had an excellent selection, although if you are a light eater you are probably better off elsewhere. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was quiet both inside and outside since it's far away from the tourist hordes in central Amsterdam. I would stay here again.",5,2019,07,03
100,Very nice stay in a spacious complex,"We had a great weekend in the Hotel Arena, which has a great connection to the city and also has super hot spots nearby on foot.

We will definitely come back and recommend the hotel.

The food of the room service was delicious and the prices were okay. ",4,2019,07,03
100,Three days Amsterdam,The hotel was fantastic from check in to check out. Has the old charm with a modern revamp.  Restaurantgreat .  Position great.  Highly recommend.  Hotel right on the park lots of cafes nearby.  Near tram stop.  Can walk all attractions some adistance but Avery pleasant walk.,5,2019,07,02
100,Beautiful Hotel in a Beautiful Location,"A lovely, quiet place to stay while in Amsterdam.  Located right on the edge of a park, the setting felt relaxed and close to nature, while at the same time being only a 30 minute walk to some of the major attractions.  Highly recommend.",5,2019,07,02
100,Biggest terrace in Amsterdam,"I was here a couple of years ago before they really renovated this place. What attracts me to this hotel is its location in the park, with a terrace that is one with the park, on sunny days this is a real asset,  actually unbeatable. They told me that this hotel has the ‘largest” terrace in terms of square meters of the city. I got a room overlooking the courtyard, and my bed was at the top level connected with a stair in the room. The high ceilings give a spacious feel. Wifi works great, no password. The bar is great, food is reasonable, but the really excel with their breakfast, it was a feast to have breakfast outside, Wonderful experience.",4,2019,06,30
100,Very nice,"Great location near tram stops, park, and zoo. Safe area. Very nice employees. Storage lockers for luggage were nice, because we arrived from cruise ship at 10:30 a.m. and room wasn't ready yet. Room was comfortable and well appointed. Bathroom lighting and shelves/storage were lacking, no washcloths, no bath mat second day, and shower was odd-slippery tile floor and small glass wall let too much water run out on floor.",4,2019,06,29
100,Best holiday ever,The hotel was amazing inside and out. Great location and lovely park to walk at night. The room was stunning and clean. However the sink could’ve done with a bit more scrub. The staff were lovely and the place made us feel at home. Would highly recommend and we would definitely come back! Thank you hotel arena😀,5,2019,06,28
100,"Beautiful, fancy hotel with a great location",I stayed for one night in June. The location on the edge of a big park is great although getting to the main entrance was a bit of a detour while an unmarked side entrance would've been better for me but I only found that when I left. Service was fine. The room was fancy-modern with everything you expect. I didn't like the wooden floors which transmitted step sounds a bit more than I would've liked. You can hear your floor and even a bit of the wall creak when people walk around the hall.,4,2019,06,26
100,Weekend Break,Weekend break for my husbands 40th. Beautiful Hotel great location within walking distance to tram and city centre. Comfortable rooms and great room service. Easy Check In and Check Out with very pleasant friendly staff.,4,2019,06,24
100,Great,"Great location, lovely room, very nice and helpful stuff. The room has the beds in loft and it gives a feeling of being much larger than it actually is. Situated on the verge of a park and a mere walk from the centre of everything.",5,2019,06,23
100,Fantastic,Very nice hotel set in a beautiful park. My room felt more like a apartment then a hotel room. Very close to transport into Amsterdam centre (10-15 minutes from leaving hotel into dam square). I would recommend this hotel to friends visiting amasterdam without a doubt. ,5,2019,06,23
100,Pleasant experience,"I had a pleasant experience with Hotel Arena. On the edge of Amsterdam’s Vondelpark, excellent location. No noise complaints about traffic noises or other guests. Walking distance from Amsterdam Muiderpoort station. ",5,2019,06,22
100,Lovely hotel,"Enjoyed our stay staff very friendly and helpful 
We were initially not happy with our room room due to the stairs leading up to our sleeping area 
however the staff were happy 
to move us to a room on one level 
Many thanks ",5,2019,06,22
100,Love this place!!,"Hubby and I are here for 7 days. Location is perfect. With public transportation it's close enough to the city centre, yet in a nice park where you feel like you can escape from all the hustle and bustle. The staff is so nice and made us feel welcome for our entire stay. As in some of the previous reviews, we did have an issue with the shower not draining properly, but maintenance staff fixed it for us as soon as we asked. We booked a classic room, and it was very comfortable. The mini fridge is not stocked, which we took total advantage of by getting snacks and treats from nearby grocery stores. We rented bikes for a few hours and had the time of our lives exploring the city. All in all, hotel arena was a perfect choice for our anniversary vacation and we would come back here in a heart beat.",5,2019,06,21
100,average,"very nice building and services and the park outside is great. Disppointed by the bed room which I expected to be better value for money. I had a room with a mezzanine. The mezzanine space is not huge and the downstairs space is not huge either and the 2 spaces don't work together (for example you can only watch TV in the bedroom), and the bathroom is downstairs... a bit weird, but not a ""show stopper"" if you will not spend a huge amount of time in your room. ",3,2019,06,20
100,A lovely hotel in a beautiful setting!,"We rented bikes from the shop on other side of the park as recommended by the hotel as hotel had none left that morning, and we were able to cycle to the train station on way to airport and leave off bikes in a sister store beside the station! Was great way to get about and experience the culture of the city. ",5,2019,06,20
100,Loverly hotel,"This was the hotel we stayed after our return to Amsterdam, arriving early not sure what we would do with our luggage but they have several different size lockers for your luggage till your room is ready great idea, when given our room you have sections that have security doors you have to use , travelling with friends we were on floor 2 & they were on floor 3 our pass would lot letterboxed us into their floor, we had to call & meet down stairs worked good . had aproblem with a case & one of the chaps from the main desk could not have been more helpful even getting some strong glue to help us repaire the case to get home & ti is still holding. thanks to our friend on the desk do not rember his name sorry.",5,2019,06,19
100,What a find’,"I have just spent the weekend with friends at Hotel Arena. What a lovely hotel! Really welcoming and helpful staff, where nothing was too much trouble.
Impressive building with a great history and amazing staircases and decor. 
The main restaurant and drinking area had a real buzz about it and we spent hours sitting outside being served by great attentive staff. The lovely park area is right in front of this hotel. 
Great food at a reasonable price and the buffet breakfast was fantastic. 
Rooms very clean with split level facilities. 
We were even able to store our cases in secure lockers during the day after check out as we had an evening flight. 
We absolutely loved it and would totally recommend and return for a second visit. ",5,2019,06,19
100,Wonderful location,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful town!
Rooms were very clean and staff was so pleasant and sympathetic! Breakfast was great and the stay was really enjoyable! Ppease go there and enjoy Amsterdam life! Wow!",4,2019,06,18
100,Overpriced and not clean,"We have been visiting the Arena for many years, having stayed at other locations recently the hotel has become overpriced and in need of a good clean, the cost to stay here two nights is now double what we pay elsewhere so will be our last visit here",2,2019,06,15
100,Wonderful location directly at the park,All the employees in the hotel are very friendly and it was a pleasant stay for us !  We ´ll never forget these 4 days in this wonderful city of Amsterdam. The breakfast was excellent und the location lovely,5,2019,06,14
100,Wonderful location!,I hesitate to stay again after last year unpleasant stay but this year’s stay was excellent! My room was ready when I arrived early. It was also upgraded to compensate last year u pleasant stay. What a good way to start one’s vacation! Thank you Hotel Arena!,5,2019,06,13
100,Terrible service in a picturesque hotel,"We were so looking forward to staying at this charming hotel! We arrived after booking a suite to a room no bigger than the standard price (except with a weirdly placed bathtub in the middle of the carpeted room). After mentioning that we were disappointed they moved us to the Loft room which is much more suite-esque and more in line with the price we paid for. 

Then, after being out all day we came back to find the door left wide open to our room which was alarming given we came back late at night and the room we were in was separate to the main hotel. The room was also half made up, coffee pods not replaced and balcony disgusting with bird poo everywhere and leaves not swept. The hotel resolved this by sending us a letter saying nothing had been stolen and giving us 1 drink complimentary (there were two of us staying)

Then we tried to hire bikes (comes at a cost) and after the first bike they gave us 12 hours before was 'no longer available' - 3 bikes later we were late for a canal brunch tour and 100 euros out of pocket. The hotel comped the bike fee but said they could not provide any more compensation (not even offering their own canal tour).

Overall terrible experience not worth the price and not relaxing or enjoyable despite a beautiful setting.",1,2019,06,11
100,Weekend in Amsterdam,"A lovely hotel,beautiful setting. Easy to reach all areas of Amsterdam. Restaurant excellent quality. Rooms lovely but bathrooms on second floor smell from shower drains🤢 Staff helpful. Would recommend if wasn’t for drains",4,2019,06,11
100,Pleasant stay in the City Park,"The hotel is a bit old stylish. The restaurant and the rooms are nice but the common area is very old. The Hotel is close to the city center (3 steps with Metro) and the staff is really nice. 
The food and cocktails in the hotel are really good. Nice atmosphere at the terrace.",3,2019,06,11
100,Very nice hotel!,"I stayed in a suit standard for two days and the room was really nice. Huge windows which make the room really light and very comfortable bed. The hotel is really quiet and is in a very nice area. Amazing breakfast buffet, although maybe a bit expensive. Overall, a very lovely stay.",4,2019,06,11
100,"Outside woohooo, Inside pooh",The Loby and the Restaurant are very lovely. But our room was unpleasant and not very clean. Next day we just became fresh towels but the room was not cleaned. Very disapointing for the price and a four-star Hotel.,2,2019,06,11
100,Hotel Arena-Excellent,"An exceptional place to be. Clean, very quiet, friendly, with great breakfast, and beautiful rooms. I was there for two days, and I wish I had more time to enjoy more of what the place offers, and by this I mean the location inside a beautiful park.",5,2019,06,11
100,Hotel arena,"Able to check in early as the room was ready, always a surprising bonus. Room was spacious and clean. Had a lovely patio overlooking the garden. Loved the fridge, very handy. I forgot my coat and they emailed me to say i had  left and they could post, as my friends were still there they brought it home for me. Would definitely stay there again. Food and drinks were delicious and not expensive. ",5,2019,06,10
100,Old Church turned Hotel in Oosterpark,"I staked 6 nights in the Hotel Arena while in Amsterdam for business, including meetings taking place in the hotel.  I had room 104 which was a single story room with VERY high ceilings.  While the room had AC, it did not go below 19 degrees, which did not make the room very cool during a heat spell in Amsterdam, especially given the vent is very high up the 20+ foot ceilings.  There are windows that open to the room, however they overlook a courtyard that was rather noisy some nights as people enjoyed being outside (and in early June it is light much longer with the sun going down around 10 pm and up by 4 am). The bed was very comfortable and had a safe and mini-fridge and well as coffee and tea in the room.  Do note that the bathroom walls are glass and look into the bedroom so privacy could be an issue if sharing the room. A hairdryer was provided, but mine was VERY dirty with lint so I didn't use it.  The vent in the bathroom was also very dirty, but the rest of the room was clean.  The breakfast buffet is very nice with both hot - Dutch pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. - and cold items - breads, meat, cheese, salmon, fruit, cereal, pastries and more!  Breakfast was enough to keep me full until dinner.  I ate twice at the restaurant at the Hotel Arena.  One night sitting outside overlooking Oosterpark and the other night in the restaurant.  Both meals were very nice!  The location can't be beat with Oosterpark right out the front steps.  Also be sure to peek into the part of the hotel that is an old Church.  One last note, it was very hard to get an Uber from this location.  I don't know if that is normal or an issue with the time of my stay but on both days I need an Uber in the morning to take me to my office I had to wait more than 30 minutes and submit many requests before an Uber picked up my ride.  May be worth scheduling a taxi through the front desk.",4,2019,06,09
100,"Good hotel, bad restaurant","Really nice area, but the service and quality of food in the restaurant sucks. And the service is really unfriendly, not willing to talk English. Food was average, but with a high price. In general I would not eat there anymore",1,2019,06,06
100,Hotel with a soul,"Nice atmosphere and good location.
I recommend the park restaurant both in the day and evening time.
 Close to everything and quiet. The hotel is situatet in a park where you can do sport or take a walk.

",4,2019,06,05
100,Perfect hotel,Brilliant service getting us sorted out way before our check in time allowing us to head back out! Hotel is in a perfect location right with a huge park as it’s garden! The rooms were really nice And the whole hotel as a whole is just a lovely place ,5,2019,06,05
100,Great Hotel..great location,"Great for a few days break...Situated on the edge of a beautiful park..Great outside terrace for eating ,drinking and relaxing..very chilled..Staff very friendly and helpful,with nothing ever a problem.
Would defo go back..",4,2019,06,04
100,"Nice hotel, but bad restaurant service","Five night stay with colleagues as we were attending a conference in the city. The hotel is located close to city center and had beautiful surroundings. 

The downside to the hotel is that it is not very pleasant with bathrooms that have see-through glass doors that don’t close or lock. 

The restaurant looks beautiful and has a nice atmosphere, but I will not recommend going. The hotel need to work on their service and it would be nice if the staff smiled more.

The staff took forever to bring our drinks after we ordered, and when we wanted to pay, it also took a really long time. One night we had booked a table for a big group (15 people). The staff missed one of the orders, which made me wait 10 minutes extra on my food to arrive. The staff was very rude about it, and did not give a real apology. They also did not bring some of our drink orders, but put it on the check anyway. 

",2,2019,06,03
100,High expectations a little disappointed in service,My sister and I booked arena and we were very excited because the hotel is beautiful and located in a park. We had a lovely upgraded room which we opted to pay extra for but something went wrong with the reservation and the front desk thought we were only staying for one night. We were bothered by the cleaning staff several times and the front of desk to vacate the room despite reiterating that we had in fact paid for and extra night. It was frustrating to keep repeating this and put some stress on our trip. ,3,2019,06,03
100,Outstanding experience,"This place is an absolute gem,the location, the staff,the atmosphere, the food,the drinks selection. Having stayed in Amsterdam many times,this is the place I will be back too ! Well worth getting up earlier in the day for a walk through the park.",5,2019,06,02
100,FIRST TRIP TO AMSTERDAM & IT WONT BE MY LAST :),"This was my first ever first to Amsterdam so hoped it was all I had heard about from family and friends. We booked a 4 day break away as part of my Husbands birthday celebrations so were really looking forward to it - we weren't disappointed from the moment we entered Hotel Arena.

We asked to upgrade our room and a member of staff on the front desk offered to show us 2 other rooms, we chose room 209 as it was on the 2nd floor, was very large and very comfortable.   The staff at this hotel are the friendliest I have encountered for some time, nothing was too much trouble and they made us extremely welcome from the start.   The only thing I noticed is that the corridors on some of the upper floor are very dark which is the only fault I could find, but the staff advised us that the hotel was being refurbished bit by bit so that's why some of the corridors look like they needed new décor.  The breakfast choice was superb and tasted delicious  the restaurant meals were also delicious and the general ambience of the restaurant and bar was extremely relaxing and welcoming :)    Cant fault the Arena Hotel and the staff who work there are a real credit to such a wonderful place ! We will be back and will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends, THANK YOU ALL for a wonderful stay !! :)       ",5,2019,05,31
100,Fantastic,The hotel is amazing the stuff are friendly and helpful and the surroundings are beautiful. It's easy the get to the trams and does not take long to get to most places from the hotel it's a good location to stay.  we hired  bikes for a day...what a amazing way to see the city. ,5,2019,05,30
100,First anniversary ,"We travelled back to Amsterdam for our first wedding anniversary. We stayed in Hotel Arena for two nights whilst we were there. The hotel is set in the beautiful Oosterpark and only a 10 minute walk to a tram stop that takes you to the centre. Reception staff were friendly and our room was clean and comfortable. We had a drink in the bar, which was reasonably priced, but did not eat there as there are plenty of other places around Amsterdam serving good food for a cheaper price. My only negatives were that there was no “do not disturb” sign and the provided toiletries were basic (just hand soap and shower gel, no moisturisers, cotton wool etc which I have experience at other hotels of the same star). 
Overall a comfortable stay.",4,2019,05,29
100,Great Hotel,"Have always wanted to visit Amsterdam just didn’t realise how expensive accommodation was. I struggled to find a hotel with private bathroom that was reasonably priced. Then Hotel Arena came up at a discounted rate, It was still more than I would normally pay for a hotel but a reasonable price in comparison to other hotels in Amsterdam. The hotel was lovely but I have to admit, we were up and away first thing and not back until late evening so didn’t spend much time in the hotel. ",5,2019,05,29
100,Gorgeous hotel in a gorgeous city!,"The hotel is in a perfect location within the city - Amazing views and great accessibility. Staff were very helpful and polite. Room was cosy and stylish! Overall, we had such a lovely and peaceful stay. We are sure to return again - highly recommended hotel!",5,2019,05,26
100,3 Day Break,"Overall the hotel was lovely, staff were fabulous, friendly and helpful, hotel was in a great location within a beautiful park and with easy access to trams, trains etc.  

The room we had although adequate we did feel that it was not cosy.  Steep and narrow stairs to bedroom area.  Not child friendly especially as bathroom area is all tinted glass, this is not great either as if you are sat on the settee in the small living area, you can see right through to the bathroom and toilet area which is not ideal.

We were also unaware that there is a tourist tax which added to the cost of the holiday.  ",4,2019,05,26
100,Chris,"Can’t praise the hotel enough. The staff are great and nothing is too much trouble. I emailed the hotel a  couple of times requesting non duplex rooms for me and or friends and that it was my 60th celebration ..... Osgar  , Nina and others have made our stay very memorable and one we will cherish.... the weather definitely helped also as we have had three days of cracking sunshine and draught beer ! :-)
Lovely hotel , breakfasts are well worth the money ( with Prosecco!!!! ) lovely ambience, a tad out of town but we walked ... 30 minutes into the main area ... get a taxi back when you are ready. 

Definitely would stay here again... lovely place, lovely people ...... thank you Arena :-)

100,Horrible Stay!,"Terrible room conditions, hotel was dirty and dark. Stains on furniture, carpet, walls, bathroom plug did not work, mattress was so bad that it sloped completely to one side, almost rolled off and out of bed the first time I got into to. Stay somewhere else!",1,2019,05,22
100,Amazing and wonderful time,Perfect place to settle your ground 0 zone and start your amazing staying at amsterdam. You will enjoy among other things the Oosterpark wich is a spectacular place to rest and chill from a all Day walktour,5,2019,05,21
100,exceptional,"me and my sister loved our stay, the location is great and the building is stunning.  rooms were comfortable and loved that there was wifi throughout the hotel.  would highly recommended.  it's tucked away in a lovely part of the city",5,2019,05,20
100,hotel Arena,"Beautiful location in the Oosterpark.
Spacious room and bathroom.
Not perfectly clean and noisy elevator next to our room.
Mini bar not filled in a superior room and only two coffeecapsules, one of them already used !
A bit too expensive.",4,2019,05,20
100,"Nice,cosy and  quiet place","A very nice place ,  in a park, quiet  .Room  and lobby are cosy .Hotel's team perfect and smiling !
 Meal good and  a rich and varies buffet for breakfast .
We stayed 4 days , it s closed to center  ,40 mn for Rikjmuseum, 30 mn for Rembrandt place, 10 mn for zoo !",5,2019,05,19
100,Has potential not 4* though,"Great location in the park, as other guests have said.
Our room was dirty, dusty and in need of some repairs.

Our hallway floor, needs replacing. It is bouncy and not level.

No sound insulation, can hear everything from neighbouring rooms, especially early morning and late at night.

Food and service in restaurant were good,

Staff were efficient and amiable.

100,Quirky charecterful hotel nice park location.,"Nice hotel building and location. Has a wow factor !!!
Wonderful park side location, so nice and quiet ,except for the Parakets squeaks .
10 mins walk to the tram.
Great front of house efecint and friendly.
Free Luggage lockers were a good idea for early check in and late check outs.
We experienced poor housekeeping on a number of occasions with issues ranging from bedding replacement ( anti allergy / no feather) agreed and not put in place .
Poor cleaning /servicing  involving washed cups .unwiped services. Un washed shower/basin. Poor hovering and dusting.no bin liners left .
Unprofessional approach by housekeeping .We were disturbed twice while sleeping by housekeeping once by a handyman to repair the t.v . This was not an issue reported or requested by us. A cleaner also barged in to check the room while we were sleeping in the room .
In general we enjoyed the hotel and our stay there.
Perhaps we were just unlucky with housekeeping.....",3,2019,05,19
100,Design Hotel,"The Hotel is an impressive building with a very cool Interior design. The bar & Restaurant offer really nice food. As the Hotel is locatet at a park we had a really quiet room on the third floor. The only thing we would have appreciatd is another socket near the bed. 
The breakfast was ""ok"" for two nights - the scrambled eggs seemed a bit artificial and for more Days we would have expected a wider choice of e.g. bread & cheese. It was not possible to order fried eggs or anything else. Alternatively it's also possible to eat breakfast à la carte instead of the buffet. 
The location is not too far from the center and with some walking and public Transport it was easy to get around Amsterdam.
We found the hotel rather expensive but we wantd to be sure to stay at a really nice place - and that's what it is.
",4,2019,05,19
100,"Great location, great staff","We spent the last 2 nights of our European vacation here and loved the location. The room was unique with the bed in a loft area and had a nice view of the park. We did have an issue with the shower but the manager made it right. We really enjoyed the restaurant.. Make sure you do the breakfast buffet, there's something for everyone and the staff is great. Oh, and do the boat cruise that the hotel sponsors. It was a really nice, private tour. I would stay here again.",5,2019,05,17
100,"Lovely hotel, beautiful setting.","Very comfortable and clean. Excellent, efficient customer service. Room was split level, stairs might be a problem for some guests, but was fine for us. Lovely big bed, very comfortable. Loved the hotel, beautiful building. Restaurant and bar looked good although we didn’t use it. Breakfast was very expensive, so we didn’t have that. ",4,2019,05,17
100,Quick Overnight,"We stayed here the night before flying home. I planned far enough in advance to get a good rate on our room, it was a good size standard room for Amstrdam. Great restaurant and ability to leave luggage.",5,2019,05,16
100,Grat Hotel!,"Friendly but not cheap! Great location next to park and private river cruise. Big hotel with old style, high,  rooms and loads of space. Make sure you book breakfast the night before to get the 5 euro discount - it adds up!",5,2019,05,13
100,An unusual play to stay in Amsterdam,"Really quirky and interesting particularly the bedroom, but beware of steep stairs in the night to go to the bathroom. Comfortable bed and linen, but pillows could do with a change. Overlooking park which is lovely.",4,2019,05,13
100,Wow!,This was really a very very Nice place. The staff was helpful and smiley. The food and drinks was also good. The location of the hotel was indeed Nice. A beautiful park area with only the noice of your own breath. We will return 👍 S + P,5,2019,05,13
100,Beautiful city and an amazing hotel,"Brilliant hotel conversion in an old orphanage with a church. Beautiful and creative rooms. 

Our bedroom was a loft with the bed above the main part of the room.

Great staff.

The hotel itself is situated right on a beautiful park that you can walk through before exploring Amsterdam further.",5,2019,05,11
100,Great location,"The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly. The location was great, next to several trams taking you all around Amsterdam. The Park Restaurant food selection was small but the dishes were very good. ",4,2019,05,09
100,Amazing hotel,"Hotel arena has to be the best hotel accommodation I have ever stayed in Amsterdam.  For me the location was ideal - far enough away from the centrum but close enough to visit if we wanted. 
Being on the edge of oosterpark was a lovely bonus and to wake up with a view of the park was tremendous.
The room itself was spotless and split over two levels with a traditional Amsterdam steep staircase leading to the bedroom. The windows were huge - floor to ceiling- perfect for the view of the park
We didn’t use the restaurant as we prefer to go out and about to find small, local restaurants, but it was always busy.",5,2019,05,08
100,Lovely Hotel Arena,"Located in beautiful Oosterpark,, this hotel was perfect for us. Our room was comfortable with a view of one of Amsterdam's many canals. It is a short walk to the Metro or trams (trolley) which are very easy to use.  The front desk staff told us exactly which to take to get where we wanted to go. And tickets can be purchased right at the hotel. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,05,08
100,Great Hotel in an Excellent Location,"The hotel is in a lovely park with a nice summer patio. It is close to the metro. Please note cabs do not drop at the door step of the hotel. There is a flight of stairs up to the front desk and if you have much luggage its good to alert the hotel so they can arrange for assistance. 
 We visited in April and spend a couple nights by the fire in the cafe. It was a great atmosphere and energy at the cafe is incredible. We had breakfast one morning but the menu was average. Coffee was great 
We had a room on the second floor. The room was large with steep stairs to the bedroom with stand up shower. The shower drainage was not working well at all. I would recommend a room with a tub instead of a stand up shower or ask about the drainage situation.  
The staff is exceptional. We arrived on a early flight and they were kind enough to give us a early check in, Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would stay again 
The rooms are fabulous and well set up",4,2019,05,07
100,Great hotel On the edge of a beautiful park,"We loved our stay in the great city of Amsterdam and would highly recommend the Hotel Arena. The setting of the hotel is beautiful on the edge of Oosterpark and it is easy to reach from the tram.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is ver6 clean and the room was immaculate.  The bed linen was extremely white and the bed was very comfy.  Overall, an excellent stay.",5,2019,05,07
100,Fab little find for weekend getaway,"Incredible boutique hotel. Building is amazing. Fab location very close to main areas. 
Breakfast was fab. Rooms perfect. 
Would definitely return. Perfect for couple getaway. Bar great for cheeky nightcaps too!",5,2019,05,07
100,"In the City, In the Park","A delightful respite from hectic Centrum, Arena is removed but not distant from Amsterdam's main attractions. Breakfast and coffee were delightful, the staff might be a little more attentive to guests, but their cheerful disposition made up for any delays in service.",5,2019,05,06
100,Great hotel,"Very comfortable beds, very clean, a little bit out of the center but set in a beautiful park. Bathroom a little disorientating as all black and glass but very clean. Best sleep in a hotel for years!!👍👍👍",5,2019,05,06
100,Friendly staff and good location,"Me and my partner stayed here for three nights. The location is good, it’s just a quick tram journey to the main areas in Amsterdam (dam square and red light area etc). We ate in the restaurant in the hotel for lunch and the food was nice and the staff in the restaurant are really helpful and friendly. ",4,2019,05,06
100,May stay,"Nice hotel, relatively easy to get to central Amsterdam. Probably worth getting the GBV day ticket for metro and tram. Check in staff were great and the hotel setting is lovely. Only thing I wasn't too keen on in the room was the glass bathroom. The privacy strip was not opaque and I prefer privacy in the bathroom. The breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice and they were able to give me warm gluten free rolls which was nice. Its a little expensiveat 17.5 euros but if you want the convenience of having breakfast in the hotel it, is good quality. Particularly liked the little touch of luxury of having a bucks fizz with breakfast. Overall a nice experience.",5,2019,05,05
100,Would go again.,"What an awesome location. You'll be relaxed like a king in his palace. You have a beautiful park right in front of the hotel, a super bar and restaurant with excellent food and a very good service team. The rooms are okay. Pretty simple but comfortbale. We only had some problems with the cleanliness in our room. You are very close to a tram station and about 10 to 15 minutes to Amsterdam Centraal. We would definately go back to his hotel.",4,2019,05,05
100,"Great location, and scenic outlook over parklands.......","Ideal location and proximity to transport links and supermarket we're good. Restaurant was great, food and staff were good. Reception is attentive. Beds are comfortable but be sure to check if you have a loft room as stairs are very steep to bedroom.",5,2019,05,02
100,Nice stay,The stay was very nice. Some lights in the hotel room didn’t all work which made it hard to see things for an older lady like me. There was also no shelf in the shower which was inconvenient. But the staff were very helpful and that made up for a lot. And the food was good. ,4,2019,05,02
100,Beautiful hotel in a unique setting,"We stayed in Hotel Arena in April and we're thoroughly impressed with the experience. Situated in the picturesque Oosterpark, Hotel Arena offers an experience non-comparable to other 4 star locations in the city center.
The check in process was very swift and professional. We arrived early for our check in but adequate locker space was provided for our luggage so we could explore the city freely.
The Metro stop is a 5 minute walk and some great breakfast and brunch spots are within a 5 minute walk also. 
Our room was fantastic, equipped with a walk in shower and a loft space for the king-sized bed.
Would definitely stay again if returning to Amsterdam.",5,2019,05,01
100,Tobias Francis,"We first arrived at the hotel and was pleasantly supprised it was beautiful not just the hotel the surrounding area aswell, it was breathtaking. 

In the lobby when checking in we was a bit early to check in but thankfully they have some space you can leave your luggage and go explore the city then come back and go see your Pom on tiem very good idea so you don’t have to carry around your belongings 

When we arrived we got an upgrade from our original room and the upgrade was amazing extreamly clean and spacious with a comfy bed and a lovely shower and bath. 

Downstairs in the bar area the staff are so welcoming and lovely I couldn’t have asked for better service drinks and food are very reasonable (I would recommend the park burger and a pint of Heineken) 

All in all I would give this hotel a 5/5 because it was just the most perfect stay with everything to comfy bed to warm welcoming workers really enjoyed my stay here would definitely recommend",5,2019,05,01
100,Superb hotel in a great location,"Had a wonderful long weekend here, the facilities are wonderful and the hotel decor is outstanding - the breakfast is very expensive for what you get but the restaurant is very high quality and the food is superb, the staff were fantastic and although it’s a fair walk into the centre it’s a nice walk and the tram is very close by - would stay here again for sure ",5,2019,04,30
100,Beautiful hotel with lovely staff,"We stayed here for a few days in Spring time, the hotel location is in a beautiful city park, which we enjoyed some sunshine in every day of our stay. At night the location was quiet and peaceful, which matched the vibe of the hotel restaurant and bar. The building itself is historic and an impressive place to stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the facilities were fantastic. Very impressed and I would recommend this place highly. I will consider Hotel Arena again when I return to Amsterdam.",5,2019,04,30
100,Michele,"Would very much like to thank reception for tonight sorting upgrade for my son and his friend 
Extremely professional and quickly done.After losing his dad earlier this year he was looking forward to this break away and you have made it more special 
Thank you 
A Happy Mum",5,2019,04,29
100,So much potential - needs some TLC.,"The hotel website is clearly that, due to the age of the hotel, that rooms vary in design. the hotel is charming and the staff pleasant but, to be honest, I would probably look elsewhere if going back which is a real shame as this hotel could be amazing with some TLC.

Our 'Classic Room' was certainly not of the standard suggested by the website photos of classic rooms - the bed touched the wall on 3 sides so you couldn't get out of bed without climbing over your partner - it would have been a nice single but squeezing a (very) large bed in was a step too far.

The shower room was designed such that you couldn't have a shower without the whole bathroom (including toilet area) getting soaked and a problem with drainage meant the whole bathroom flooded if you had the shower above 'trickle'.

This has clearly been a problem previously as the floorboards outside the bathroom were water damaged and moved notably when you stood on them.

The stairs to the (dark) mezzanine lounge were not for the faint of heart - narrow, steep and no handrail - markedly different from those on the website photos. We were OK but others may not be. 

Generally the room needed some TLC to bring it up to the standard the hotel deserves.

Staff tried to rectify things but there was limited they could do during our stay.",2,2019,04,29
100,A Sanctuary,"A fantastic hotel to come back to after a long day visiting the sites of Amsterdam. Lovely to relax in the Park cafe and watch the world go by in the park. All staff were friendly and helpful both in the cafe and the hotel. The hotel is well situated, away from the main tourist area but a lovely walk into the city. The tram stop is nearby.  Our room was large and comfortable on the third floor but wasn't aware beforehand that the lift only went to the second floor. This wasn't a problem for us but might have been for someone else. ",5,2019,04,29
100,Great stay at Hotel Arena,"Lovely stay here, would recommend to any couple for a romantic room and pretty building/area. Approx 20/30 mins walk to Amsterdam central but would still stay here again. Approx 8 euros in a taxi with Uber so dont let this put you off. Lovely area and worth the money.",4,2019,04,29
100,Go for the restaurant !,"We stayed 4 nights, a short tram ride outta central Amsterdam, right on Oosterpark which is beautiful. Don’t get the loft rooms ! We changed after a night. Tiny skinny spiral stairway to bed area, easy to break your neck,  bathroom downstairs. Got a one level room the next nights, tiny but much better. Thank goodness one was available ! 
Restaurant was fabulous. Best ‘vegan ‘ Stampot in Am. Got that with extra side of veges  and a salad, a few nights there. Great service and wines. Staff at hotel were friendly and helpful though. It’s a good walk into town, not super central but public transport pass makes it easy.",4,2019,04,28
100,Very dangerous room.,Plugged drain in shower led to quickly flooding bathroom floor because of lack of shower door/lip around shower. No handrails on narrow spiral stairs. No rail on loft in bedroom. The other room i booked was extremely small. No room to move. Disappointed because pictures of hotel looked amazing. ,3,2019,04,28
100,Magic !,"A very good hotel in a fantastic location. 
Staff of bar-restaurant and of Front desk is very professional and kind. 
Around the hotel the big park is beautiful and lively. Let's use the rental bike service to reach the historical center of the city...

100,Arena hotel good hotel,"good hotel with good clean spacious room, helpfull and friendly staff good food and a park outside the main door brilliant. Good transport links to the rest of the city, good internet wifi signal great all round hotel I will stay there again",5,2019,04,26
100,Couple in Amsterdam,"The service is not so good, the rooms are not so good. Your roommate can see everything that you are doing in the bathroom.  When we checked in we would like to eat something but they coudn't tell us where we need to go for something to eat. There restaurant would not help us. ",2,2019,04,26
100,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel was booked last minute and so we were concerned with what we may end up with. But the location alone was enough, it opens straight onto a beautiful park with a lake and plenty of places to just sit and enjoy the scenery. The rooms were modern, stylish and far bigger than we expected. A fantastic stay all round! ",5,2019,04,26
100,"It has potential, but service and facilities are lacking, especially for the cost","We expected more. The switches in the room did not function intuitively and the switch in the bathroom was not by the door, but camouflaged across the room next to the open shower (?!). There was a cooler in the room instead of the usual fridge provided in hotel rooms, which was useless.
The service left something to be desired, especially in the restaurant. The wait staff missed part of our order on 2 separate occasions, and it often took a very long time to have our order taken in the first place. The food itself was good, but the experience was more than frustrating. The staff just seemed to not care, but this was a recurring theme in Amsterdam amongst the Dutch, not just in the hotel. Whenever we ate out at Asian restaurants the service was exceptional and warm, so I would recommend eating there.",2,2019,04,25
100,Best stay in Amsterdam,"The hotel with its indivituality has a special charme.
good conection to the airport and quick conection by tram to historical center. but nevertheless away from the touristic run.
situated at a  park gives a relaxed holiday feeling",5,2019,04,24
100,Amazing Hotel,"Just about to leave after a 4 night stay at this amazing hotel. First time in Amsterdam and feel well and truly spoilt. Upgraded upon arrival which was a treat, the room was really modern and quirky. Hotel staff were really helpful on arrival. There’s a mobile phone in the room that you can take out and about with you to save your data which is great - we definitely needed it!
Didn’t eat in the restaurant but had drinks, really nice, cosy atmosphere. When checking out there are secure lockers which are free to hold your luggage so don’t have to travel around the city with them on your last day. Bonus free clog keyring at checkout 😬 Great location, on the edge of a lovely park and quick tram ride into the city centre. Loved every minute!",5,2019,04,23
100,Amazing hotel,"Hotel Arena is trully amazing.
It is situated within a beautiful park.
It has an awesome terrace overlooking the park so you can enjoy your coffee or even breakfast on this terrace.
This amenity used to be a church so the whole property is interesting itself.
The room was nice, clean, the bed comfortable and the bathroom spacious and clean.
The whole hotel has great atmosphere and it is beautifully decorated and refurbished.
Breakfast is great.
Location is good. Staff is also very nice, friendly and helpful.
I really, trully enjoyed here and I would definitely recommend it. I would like to be back there one day.",5,2019,04,22
100,Too expensive for what it offers..,"Location was really good. The hotel looks nice with a beautiful park behind it. However, it was very expensive (not worth the price). I have had better (and cheaper) stay in other other hotels in Amsterdam.
Room was very small, the minibar (minifridge) did not work (it did not keep any of our stuff cool), we were on the top floor with a very small window in our room, bed as way too soft and I had back pain the next day.
",3,2019,04,22
100,Not a 4 star hotel,"He booked a Suite for 2 nights for our anniversary.
The room was located on the ground floor and had a view onto a poorly maintained internal court yard.
The view was like a cheap hotel room you get at a budget hotel. In the evening when we turned out the lights all you could hear was an air conditioning unit all night. At £250 a night I do not expect the cheap seats. The next day we asked for a new room which we got but again it was looking into the same courtyard but this time on the 1st floor. This room was old and needed upgrading 5 years earlier. 
This hotel looks amazing from the outside and the location is amazing but I would not return and would not recommend.
I am not saying I had a bad stay, I am just saying it was not worth the money and there are better places to stay.
Breakfast is €22 each. We got it free both days due to the poor standard of the suites. Breakfast was great, but I am not sure I would say this if I had to pay €88 for a weekend for 2 for breakfast!
Free food always tastes better!
",3,2019,04,21
100,Quirky and well-situated hotel with excellent staff,"Quick city break and we struck gold with this hotel. It offered decent value for money and a great location. The highlights would have to be the unusual building (former church), the friendliness of staff and fact it lies on the edge of a public park .  We walked to Dam square in less than half an hour and there is no shortage of trams nearby too. Wouldn't hesitate returning .",5,2019,04,20
100,Great Hotel," The room looked amazing and had a fresh smell . I loved the customer service and the staff in the resturant was very welcoming , I had an issue with the freshness of my food and the problem was quickly resolved. ",5,2019,04,17
100,Nice location but a little overpriced,"For the price of a stay, I would have expected a cleaner room and a better service. The shower showed many signs of mold, there was a lot of dust and dirty curtains and unfortunately the window in our room was broken and thus open. Drinks on the bar were very overpriced and small and we had to wait quite some while for them to be served. The location itself had a great view and very nice appearence. Also, the service at the front desk was very nice and helpful. Altogether a very nice hotel with an amazing location but a little too overpriced especially regarding the clealiness and quality of service in the restauraunt.",3,2019,04,17
100,So unique,"This hotel is very unique.  the staff is great and the location is great if you are using the metro system.  Breakfast is a great deal!  be careful of the rooms with ""stairs""!  the stairs are more like ladders.  our room was very large but getting to the sleeping area could be a bit of a challenge for some folks.  we would probably stay here again but would specify and single level room.  ",4,2019,04,16
100,Just amazing,"Arena hotel is beautiful, our room was on the top floor, incredibly clean, super silent and with a very nice view .
Breakfast is just delicious and the bar is super nice.
The hotel is located inside the park, so the views are simply beautiful.
The tram is 4 blocks away, but you can walk if you feel like it.
I would totally come back.

100,A little present!,"Our stay in Hotel Arena was in one word amazing. Usefool tool at check-in, giving us all information we needed about the hotel, facilities and surroundings. Loved the staff, their attention, friendliness and quality of drinks and food. Room was very comfortable, loved the shower gel (whereas usually is a boring, neutral fragrance, this was a sensation for our early morning shower. ",5,2019,04,14
100,Perfect place to visit the city,"Just at the airport following a lovely 2 night stay at The Arena. Two tiered room  was lovely and light, bed so comfortable! Breakfast was perfect. Ate in the restaurant last night and good value for money. Staff friendly and helpful. Easy access to the city and sights via the trams. Would recommend and will be back! ",5,2019,04,14
100,Perfect place for a short city break,"Lovely hotel situated in a park setting.  Easy access to public transport. 
Very helpful, friendly staff.  Room 71 was a modern split level room, stairs are steep but not a problem for us. Bed very comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate.
",5,2019,04,13
100,Excellent hotel by lovely park,"I stayed at Hotel Arena for two nights in a business trip. The hotel is fantastic - the room was absolutely gorgeous, bed extremely comfortable, and extra seats for chilling and a desk to work from. Great view from the park. The park is nice, and it is very convenient to have a quick run to relax after a busy day. I would highly recommend this place.",5,2019,04,12
100,What a beautiful hotel!,"Our room was very modern and spacious with a duplex layout. The bedroom was upstairs and looked out across the beautiful Oosterpark through floor to ceiling windows, meaning the cosy seating area downstairs also looked out across the park. The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower, with the only downside being no lock on the door (which I can only see being an issue if it was a friends trip rather than a couples holiday as ours was).

We didn't particularly use the restaurant as there was so much to see (and eat) in such little time in the city. However we did have cocktails in there on our last night, and the atmosphere was fantastic with the fire lit and fairy lights. The reception staff were so accommodating and even provided a locker for us to store our luggage on our last day so we didn't have to carry it around everywhere. Whilst all of the staff were happy to help with any queries, the bar staff in particular were really lovely. 

The hotel was easily within walking distance of many of the popular Amsterdam sights - around a half an hour walk. Yet, with the Muiderpoort Station so close it was an easy 5 minute journey to Centraal Station when we felt too tired to walk the entire way.

Highly recommend!",5,2019,04,10
100,Great stay in January 2019 at Hotel Arena,"Having never been to Amsterdam before, we decided to stay at the Hotel Arena for three nights.

The hotel provided everything we could have asked for. The location was perfect with a wonderful park and train station nearby. It was also close enough to walk to the city centre. The pubs around the hotel were lovely too.

Our room was very modern and had an upstairs as well. The cafe/restaurant was nice, a little pricier than the city but that’s what’s expected.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a weekend city break in Amsterdam.",5,2019,04,10
100,Good enough ,"It 2as a good hotel, a bit on the expensive side, but the rooms are quite ample. The attention is great, good quality breakfast.

Not extremely clean, but far from dirty. With high ceilings it might feel cold, but bed covers are more than sufficiently warm. Great natural light, and a fine view. Of course this varies from room to room, but the design is such that there's a good likelihood of getting a nice view to an open are,. Also tons of places to sit outside and chill. The restaurant is convenient and greatly taking advantage of the park access. ",4,2019,04,09
100,"Fantastic hotel, lovely staff, great spot","What an incredible place- the building and it's original features are breath taking! Awesome location, it took us about 15 minutes to get into Central using the tram. The staff (like all of the Dutch!) are so fabulous, nothing is too much trouble and all are super friendly and polite. Our room was lovely, couple of small things- the bathroom walls were glass that you could see through, it's darkened but you can definitely see the other person when you're doing your business and they can see you! It would have been nice to have a bath but not crucial. Being really knit picky, the kettle could not be separated from the power lead and had no on/off switch, Perhaps some new kettles and some blinds fitted in the bathroom would make a difference :)",4,2019,04,09
100,Wonderful stay!,Hotel Arena has very friendly staff and the building is beautiful looking over the park. Our room was perfect for us and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the second floor and our room was sort of like an attic conversion which may make others think it is too small a room. The room was spotless and the building itself was stunning. There are tram stops to go to Dam square just around the corner which is around a 3-4 minute walk which was very useful. Overall this was a wonderful hotel and I 100% recommend!,5,2019,04,08
100,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and after learning of our wedding, we were upgraded! The room was stylish, clean and comfortable. If you have knee or mobility issues I would not recommend the split level rooms, however we loved the exaggerated windows and lofted space.

The restaurant is a stylish place for guests and locals alike and the food does not disappoint! 
",5,2019,04,05
100,Great hotel with amazing grounds,"Stayed in this lovely hotel for 4 nights, really clean bright and airy with lots of green plants and an open fire which makes it really cosey at night. The staff are really friendly and helpful. Had breakfast most mornings which was good but would have liked a bigger chance, and if your a coffee lover like me this is not for you, it comes from a machine and is lukewarm. We stayed in room 31 on the ground floor and the room is quite small for to adults, but comfortable.
I would definitely recommend this hotel the location is great the trams run regularly and you can get a 3day pass which cost 17 euros which allows you to use the buses and the metro. Takes about 10 /15 minutes to get in to central Amsterdam.",4,2019,04,05
100,"Great hotel, with a lot of promise","Stayed here with my partner and 2 friends for a long weekend.  Amazing building, nice interior.  Work being carried out, but did not affect us.  We arrived early and were allowed to put our luggage in to lockers until later in the day.  Went and explored the area and came back and checked in about 7pm.  Room was split level which makes them fun, and like most of Amsterdam, stairs were steep, but not a problem.  We caught a tram into the city centre most days and a travelcard for all over Amsterdam cost us £18 euros, which was amazing considering it costs that much for a day in London.  Tram took about 10 minutes to Dam Square.  Only minor problem we had was that our room was next to a fire door that didn't have a soft closer, so closed with a bang everytime someone walked through which woke us up a couple of times.  Beds are very comfortable.  A great stay.",4,2019,04,04
100,My place in Amsterdam,"A very nice hotel with a very good service in all plans. I recommend it for the environment (into a Park) but also the interior design of the hotel ( simple, elegant, historical). The food is excellent. ",5,2019,04,04
100,Excellent stay in the trendy East of Amsterdam,I ad a great time at the Hotel Arena. It was close to the conference venue and a 30 mins walk to the city center. I can highly recommend to stay there. I really liked the design of the hotel - combining old and new. Also the breakfast was very tasty.,5,2019,04,04
100,Very nice,"Good situation in close to University of Amsterdam. Service was very good at the front desk and at the breakfeast. Aircondition was at the room, but it was little bit ineffectual. Beautiful carden just front of hotel.",4,2019,04,03
100,Not The Hotel For Me,"Staff at the hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful, restaurant was lovely for food, drinks and nice to chill out throughout the day. 

Issues with a humming noise at night when trying to sleep which was annoying when actually trying to sleep. Room lighting is a little poor expecially when trying to get ready to go out in the evening and you can hear every noise from the hallway. 

Hotel is nice but just wasn’t a hotel for me. ",3,2019,04,03
100,Could easily be 4.5!,"Sort out some easy to fix issues with the bedroom and this would be 4.5. A noisy airco fan that could not be turned off, lack of privacy in toilet, due to glass window,  lack of power sockets making phone charging difficult",3,2019,04,02
100,Hotel Arena is beautiful,"Very nice hotel, we enjoyed our holiday very much! Very good breakfast, excellent check-in and check-out, good service, nice comfortable hotel rooms. I highly recommend the Hotel Arena for a trip to Amsterdam!",4,2019,04,02
100,Beware! Some standard rooms are nothing like the pictures,"We were first given a room in the attic where the ceiling was so low my husband couldn't stand up (if I remember correctly room number was 240). The pictures of the standard room in the booking website was nothing like this and we really felt deceived. Then we asked to have our room changed and were given a real standard room, just like in the pictures. I feel the hotel  shouldn't be even Giving that first room we were offered to any of its guests, as it clearly is false advertising. Those attic rooms should have their own category and any guest shuold choose knowing they will not be able to stand up in the room. Because of this negative start, we weren't able to enjoy our stay as much as we hoped.",3,2019,04,01
100,Great hotel!,"Great hotel to stay in Amsterdam! Nice placement, great restaurant. 
Highly recommended for anyone. If you old person - ask room with 1 floor, because part of rooms have 2 floors. Very clean, tidy, polite personal.",5,2019,04,01
100,Christmas Gift,Hotel situated within park. Nice location. Room clean. Polite and helpful staff. Restaurant service not so good. Waited for over 30 minutes on two occasions. Evening meal was awful. Chose the park burger and fries. What a mistake. Worst burger I have ever tried. As for the fries. Well one word. Charred.,3,2019,03,31
100,Stunning double room,"Large bed, clean, modern large bathroom. Make sure you get the double room overlooking the courtyard. 20' ceiling, floor to ceiling windows, feel like royalty.

Restaurant overlooks the park, good service and very comfortable layout that lets you choose formal dining or lounging drinks.",5,2019,03,31
100,"Amazing quality, amazing price","Pros-
-duplex room
-location in the park
-beautiful room
-beautiful building
-Free coffee and tea
-large bed
-modern bathroom

Cons-
-shower drain clogged during our stay but it was fixed immediately upon informing the front desk staff",5,2019,03,31
100,Filthy,"Our room was so dirty. There was dust everywhere, stains on the walls and even dirty clothes left from the previous guest! 
If you're looking to stay near the centre it's also not that near so I really don't recommend.
It's far from comfort.",1,2019,03,30
100,2 night stay in Amsterdam,"Both myself and my husband stayed at the Hotel Arena for 2 nights whilst visiting Amsterdam. Hotel was great, comfortable rooms with really friendly staff. We had breakfast and dinner whilst staying at the hotel which was great no complaints. Location was good in that it was located over looking the park but I would have liked to have been a little closer to the centre. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,03,29
100,Lovely place to get a good sleep after wondering around Amsterdam," My Fiancé (he proposed on the Staalmeestersbrug bridge on this trip) and I had a lovely stay at the hotel arena, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and the location of the hotel is great, we bought tram passes and they were perfect and got us everywhere we wanted to go. They only had a split level room available when we arrived which we were happy with, the only downside to this was that it got pretty hot of an evening as the bed was on the upper level. The room was very clean on arrival, however the cleaners didn’t clean the room very well throughout the stay, it got quite dusty and the bed sheets didn’t seem like they were changed, however it was a short stay so it wasn’t the end of the world. The only strange thing was that the bathroom was made of glass and from the outside you could see in, yet from the inside you couldn’t see out, almost like the glass had been installed the wrong way round. The best part for me was the location, you walk straight out into the park with a beautiful view, we loved taking pictures out here. I would recommend this hotel, but maybe only to couples because of the bathroom situation. Thank you for having us! ",4,2019,03,29
100,Brilliant stay. Would definitely return.,"My partner and I stayed for 2 nights and had a very enjoyable experience. Very clean, king size bed which is very comfy. Breakfast was pricey so didn’t try. Staff are friendly and helpful. Helped us with a taxi for our night out which came within 10 minutes. Guided us on multiple routes via public transport to the airport. No milk or sugar provided with the tea unfortunately but staff were happy to help and get some when asked. Late checkout is €15 per hour and a brilliant louggage keeping system is implemented. Hotel is on the park so the view is beautiful. Brilliant value for money would definitely return, hopefully soon! ",5,2019,03,29
100,Great stay!,"We met at the arena (a disco then) 20 years ago so we came back to celebrate and enjoyed Every minute. The location is perfect, great vibes, love the design. People really nice and the food at Park Restaurant was really good. ",5,2019,03,28
100,Needs Work,"Nice hotel. requires completing had to move room because of the smell from the vents. some work required to rooms and hallways. second room was newly refurbished but was missing the basics like a headboard for the bed,  couch - as per the brochure. The wifi was poor in the room, Wifi fast in the bar. no coffee, tea or milk in the room.
Food is good, service a little slow. 15 minute walk to center of Amsterdam. ",3,2019,03,28
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam,"This is a four star hotel. The building had a lot of history, and was a grand establishment, in keeping with its rating. Room was immaculately clean, and comfortable. Had to climb narrow, steep stairs to mezzanine. Bed was super comfortable. I wanted a bathtub, but was told I'd have to pay more for this. There was no ironing set, as advertised on the hotel website. Beverages in the room were just awful sachets of instant coffee and a could of tea bags. Room service menu was limited, and not great value for money, and despite price of food, they charge an extra fee to deliver to your room.",4,2019,03,26
100,Great hotel for researching Amsterdam,"Great hotel to stay in Amsterdam. Nice and polite service, great placement. Hotel based in the park, so you can explore Amsterdam right behind door of hotel. Although it placed in calm part of Amsterdam so you will sleep non listening night life :)
Older people should clarify the filling of the room, as some of the rooms are double-decker, with steep stairs.",5,2019,03,26
100,Fantastic place,"The place was very nice and interesting, in a nice area, with a lot of amenities.
The room was clean and bright.
The relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant was fantastic.
We're sure we will come back again .",5,2019,03,25
100,Steven,"The hotel was great. Also the breakfast was very good with good fresh product. The room was clean and had a comfortabke bed. The location was great, because the tram was in front and had a good connection to the center. The bar was perfect with a great view on the park. I can only recommand this hotel with breakfast! ",5,2019,03,25
100,Pleasantly surprised ,"It’s worth mentioning that we got this hotel as part of a package including flights and it was all for a very good price so we were not expecting amazing things having stayed in a couple of shocking hotels/hostels in Amsterdam before. 

On arrival the entrance is inside a park and as we arrived at night it was all lit up and looked amazing. Not bad to get to from Central station (tram 14 and a 10 min stroll). 
The hotel has at the front a lovely bar/restaurant and the hotel lobby although small was always staffed and the staff were helpful. 
The room itself was a split level room and although a little grubby, overall it was presentable and done what we wanted. We did note that the heating was on in the room but the vent upstairs and the thermostat downstairs so whilst the downstairs was cool, the upstairs was an oven. We turned it off and opened the window!!!! 
The bed was comfy and clean and although it’s a converted orphanage we didn’t see or hear any chilling sounds of children singing in the hallways 👻.
A nice plus was a decent shower which seemed to have an endless supply of hot water. 

Overall we were very happy with the hotel and when we mentioned any issues they took a genuine interest. This isn’t a Hilton hotel and you do get what you pay for. I do honestly feel the price we paid was reflected in what we got so overall we were very happy! We would stay again for sure. ",5,2019,03,24
100,Spectacular with a unique personality,"This hotel is superb. It’s definitely pricier than most accommodations I usually stay in (I often stay in hostels) but I love it. It’s very near the tram station and fairly near the metro station. The park is stunning. The hotel also has its own unique personality. That’s important to me. I prefer unique hotels than a cookie cutter chain hotel. The service is impeccable. On the first day, I found I had the wrought luggage. The concierge person helped me contact the airport and book me a taxi and I got my luggage back. One note: it takes a solid minute to get off the grounds of the hotel because you need to leave the park and get onto the streets that’s the only, very minor, downside.",5,2019,03,22
100,First timer to Amsterdam,"What a wonderful hotel beautiful mix of old & new, one of the best hotels we have stayed in. History & character combined with modern facilities. All rooms have there own style.
Staff are so very happy & will go the extra mile to make your stay the best they can.
Food excellent, breakfast amazing.
The area is lovely although a little wet when we visited, but you can't choose the weather & there are so many things to do &places to see just a short tram/metro ride away buy tickets at the hotel. Also found some lovely café s close by.
We will be going back later in the year.
The park is a lovely place to stroll & excercise in & great for children too.
Wonderful staff throughout the hotel. Well deserved four star rating",5,2019,03,21
100,Perfect accommodation,"

Perfect accommodation. Great place near the park and close to the city centre. You need only 5 to 10 minutes walking and 10 more minutes through the tram or metro to arrive at centre. Beautiful interior and excellent breakfast ",5,2019,03,20
100,Short break,"Lovely hotel set in park
Fab staff
Great room
Room waa spotless
Had lockers to leave cases in
Upgraded on arrival
Food qas fantastic and breakfast wasabsolutely amazing
Set a little hit out of city bit trams v efficient",5,2019,03,20
100,Mindblowing location,"Overall a really great accommodation experience! Flawless from checkin to checkout, superfriendly staff and great venue. The rooms are not quite 100% sound proof as i could hear people walking back and forth in the hall way, but the outside compensated that as it is really quiet. The only thing you can hear are the birds whistling, which makes my day!  
I just had to adapt my sleep position as the pillows are huge and heavy. The first morning I had a neck ache...",4,2019,03,20
100,Stylish and cosy,"excellent restaurant and bar area with view to a park; very friendly reception; my room was clean but small with a steep staircase to a second level with an office desk and an empty minibar, the bath room small, no space to put things and with a rainforest shower only",5,2019,03,19
100,Amazing,"Top facilities, excelllent food and staff, would definitely go again. One point to make is it was around 30 minute walk out of centre and 15 min walk from red light district so be prepared to walk or get public transport, very easy to walk or get tram in though",5,2019,03,19
100,a hotel not to return to,"dirty and usty rooms, dirty tables at breakfast, small rooms, no shelfs or racks to put things, staff does not care at all for complains, expensive parking, very good situated in Amsterdam, good to reach shops etc",3,2019,03,18
100,V nice hotel,"A very nice hotel with lovely features. Easy to go to the city by tram. Nice people on the desk helpfull. We found our room a bit small for what we paid, only a desk and the bed... I was expenting something more for a 4 star hotel. toilet lovely, no bath..just a big shower. the food in restaurant it's amazing",4,2019,03,18
100,Business meeting with European colleagues,"For a European business meeting we stayed one night in the hotel and we had a meeting arrangement for one day. The location of the hotel is beautiful, nearby the Oosterpark. How lovely must this be during spring and summer. The atmosphere, the hotel staff, the food is just great. Very nice old building (former orphan's house) beautifully restored with respect for details. The location of the hotel in relation to the city center is also perfect. In 10 minutes to Leideplein by tram which is just perfect.",5,2019,03,15
100,Recent Stay,"Had a lovely stay at Hotel Arena, with my 13 year old daughter.  This was part of her Xmas/Birthday, which the hotel were aware of and kindly gave us a voucher for a free drink.
Comfortable, clean and fairly central",5,2019,03,14
100,Amazing Hotel,The hotel was lovely and in a wonderful park location. Our room was set over two floors with an amazing view of the park. Staff were efficient and friendly at all times. We had a really great stay here!,4,2019,03,13
100,very good,"Very good place, interior decoration very ""green"" and peaceful - bed little bit too soft - bathroom with shower and bath . Smiling welcome - indoor parking for big car (multivan) so that is great. Location near the tramway 1 and 3 with a park view.",5,2019,03,11
100,Great stay,The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was beautiful in a lovely setting. The only slight negative is I felt the room was quite cramped.. the stairs weren’t nice to walk down as they were so small. The bathroom isn’t overly private if you were travelling with a friend.,4,2019,03,11
100,Lovely Visit,"We booked this hotel & didn’t disappoint. It is in a lovely location in the park. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly. The hotel itself is really modern. It is in a good location also close enough to the centre & tram stops - I recommend the Zoo if you are visiting Amsterdam. We will be back again at some point in the future I am sure. 

Thanks again for a lovely stay. ",5,2019,03,09
100,Short break,"Had a great couple nights here late April fantastic weather for the two days, when we arrived at the airport we decided to get the train to Central Station, seemed like the cheaper option except we were told to get on the wrong train and after a nice journey into the countryside the ticket collector put us on the right train to get back to Central Station, we were going to get a tram to the hotel but we were a bit tired so we got a taxi, cost 25 euros, when we got to the hotel they asked if we wanted a upgrade with breakfast for 99euros for the stay, we said OK it was worth it our room was excellent lovely and clean with a free mobile phone and for our stay plus tea and coffee big TV with BBC, breakfast was good buffet style, and cool restaurant where we had a evening dinner which was great, staff were lovely would go again, went to Anne Frank's House, the sex museum, and generally wandered around Amsterdam, had expensive pancake 21euros for two, later in the day we found a very reasonable department store for coffee and cakes for 9euros, on our way back to the airport we decided to to get a taxi back 45euros a leaf electric car, altogether we had a fantastic break if only it was longer, maybe next time. ",4,2019,03,08
100,Excellent Hotel,"Having decided to go to Amsterdam we searched through quite a lot of hotels until we found Hotel Arena, the photos of the hotel were what caught my eye to start off with as I love a hotel with a story behind it. 
We decided to book secretly hoping for one of the duplex rooms with the bed upstairs! 

Following a delayed flight we arrived at the hotel, it’s a fantastic hotel to look at from the outside and as you walk in it just gets better, the original stair cases give it a grand feel coupled with a modern yet classic decor it really is breathtaking. 

We checked in and were given the room I’d been hoping for, modern downstairs black glass bathroom with a massive comfy bed upstairs. 

The bar/restaurant is a lovely place to sit an have a drink with excellent service from the staff taking your order from your seat rather than having to stand at the bar. 

We found the hotel easy to get to using public transport and were glad we didn’t get a taxi as we first thought we would. 

With the hotel being outside of the city centre it was nice to travel into the busy area seeing all neighbourhoods as you went in and out, we used a few different routes in an out of the city always using the tram and had no problems.

I would highly recommend this hotel!! ",5,2019,03,07
100,Amazing and very modernl hotel,out of the four times ive been to Amsterdam hotel arena was by far the nicest hotel ive stayed in. was very clean and very modern. air con broke on the first day and night but was sorted next day by the manager. carnt wait to come back.  ,5,2019,03,07
100,Fantastic stay,"We had a fantastic stay at the hotel! Helpful and friendly staff, beutifuly warm rooms overlooking the canals. Great location for the trams. The hotel is situated in the middle of a beautiful park. Lots to do and see. ",5,2019,03,07
100,"nice location, good breakfast, but noisy room of ventilation device","+ Nice location
+ Nearby trams, busses, para and citycenter
+ good breakfast

First night in room which made noise from ventilation device. Like a continues buzzing sound comparing to the sound of a vacuum cleaner, but then less loud. If you have good ears, and need the quietness while sleeping, please ask for a room which makes no sound from ventilation/ temperature device. 
Second night they gave me another room which was to warm at the bedroom part by entering room. 16 degrees outside temperature, in the room it was like 23. Had to put the airco on for an hour. This hotel has seriously temperature problems.",3,2019,03,06
100,Good hotel,"Our days in the hotel have been good. The room was quiet and the bed was super comfortable. Our advice is to check the house keeping service better. There were two days that our room was not cleaned and we had to tell you when we came back at night. The room was not cleaned well, they just made the bed and changed towels but the bathroom was not cleaned every day. It is really disappointing since this is unacceptable in a hotel of your category.",4,2019,03,06
100,Highly recommended hotel and the staff are wonderful,"We will definitely be returning for another stay. From the staff to the surroundings 10/10. It is situated on beautiful grounds and easy access to local amenities. It has a warm welcoming and so relaxing atmosphere. 
",5,2019,03,06
100,Amazing hotel!!!,"I’d first like to start off this review by saying that I do not understand the 1 or 2* ratings that people have given this hotel. 
From start to finish our trip was made perfect by this hotel. 
We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel (€60 with a tip) as we weren’t sure on the public transport routes and after a delayed flight we didn’t want to hang around. 
We arrived at the hotel around 1pm and reception advised us that our room would be ready in around 20 minutes. We decided to wait and have lunch in the hotel restaurant. Beautiful food and reasonably priced compared to meals in the city. 
We went back to reception and our room was ready so we checked in with ease. 
When we arrived in our room, we were amazed- room 173! We had a lovely 2 story room. Ground floor had 2 chairs, a table, a wardrobe with a fridge and kettle with coffee making facilities. The bathroom was great, with free toiletries, the shower was very powerful. 
Upstairs was a huge king sized bed and a desk with a tv that had English channels. Also included was a handy phone that could be used to navigate around the centre. When booking, we explained it was our anniversary and to our surprise the bed had been decorated with rose petals and a balloon, along with a card wishing us a happy anniversary and a token for complimentary drinks at the bar. Amazing and thoughtful touch which was a great start to our holiday! The only issue that we had with our room was that there wasn’t a lot of storage space but for 3 days, we managed. Rooms can be quite noisy but we didn’t have any problems with other guests making noise, just a lorry outside around 7am that was loud. However, not enough to affect our stay. 
The hotel is situated in a beautiful park, around a 5 minute walk from local tram stops to get into the city. Also in walking distance is the Heineken experience. You can walk to the centre in around 25 minutes but due to the cold weather, we just caught the tram. A 24 hour pass is €8 but the trams only accept card. 
We had no issues whilst at the hotel and enjoyed our drinks at the bar one evening before heading out. Staff very friendly and are a credit to the establishment. 
Highly recommend and would return to this hotel on my next trip to Amsterdam. Really made our trip memorable. ",5,2019,03,05
100,A nice hotel,"Pleasant stay at the Hotel Arena after requesting to change rooms as the first room was an attic room which was very small and there were stains on the floor and we were unsure if the room had actually been cleaned. Second room was a mezzanine room which was very nice and clean - the hotel itself had lovely decor and the staff were very friendly. The restaurant was a nice place to have a drink after a busy day. The tram is a 5 minute walk, hotel is located in a quieter part of the city but a good location if you don’t want to be in the centre. ",3,2019,03,04
100,Beautiful hotel ,"The most beautiful hotel to explore Amsterdam from. Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate my 21st. 

We arrived at the airport at roughly 21:30 so opted to get a taxi (which was really expensive €60+) you must only get the taxis that the airport suggest. Although this did only take us half an hour to get to the hotel. We discovered that you can actually use the train and then trams for only a few euros the train tickets can be purchased from within the airport at the yellow self service train ticket desks. 

We arrived at the hotel for around 22:00 the receptionist checked us in with no hassle (don’t forget tourist tax which was around €25 for the four nights). We were given room 132 which was one of the famous mezzanine rooms! The top had a sofa, desk, information pack, fridge, tea, coffee and even a smart phone we could use to book trips. The bottom had two twin beds put together to make one, tv and en-suite.  The room was lovely the only criticism is that the room was awfully hot I couldn’t imagine what it would be like in the summer and the walls could do with some paint work had all black marks on. The hotel was lovely though which such a friendly welcoming feel too it. 

The restaurant was good too we ate here one night I had eggplant lasagna which was amazing and my boyfriend had the steak which was also good our meal came to around €70 this was with wine and beer. For cheaper meals I would definitely recommend going into central Amsterdam! ( meals more like €40 for the same kinda food) Best transport getting into the centre is by tram they come so frequently using the 14 from “alexanderplein” which is just a little walk right of the hotel getting off at a stop called “dam” which is by literally everything the red light district, shopping all the other attractions. This was the most perfect hotel to do all our travelling from would definitely like to return",4,2019,03,04
100,Amazing long weekend,"Hotel was super nice , so close to main metro lines to get into centre. All staff were so friendly and happy. Rooms were lovely , recommend the two floor such a cool idea. The park bar area is so comfy and enjoyable to sit with a class of wine .",5,2019,03,04
100,Luxury for anyone,"Decor of the hotel is lovely and you really feel like you are experiencing luxury within a reasonable budget. The beds could be slightly more comfortable but I am also a large man. I felt like everything was provided, even a little tourist phone device which was a nice extra.",4,2019,03,04
100,"Not recommended. Rooms are too noisy, not a 4-star hotel","My boyfriend and I stayed two nights with this hotel. The quality of this 4-star hotel is worse than a motel. The first night we stayed at room 204. At around 4am, some people checked into the room located one level above us and we could hear all the activities up in their room. We could hear footsteps, conversations, moving suitcases, coughs, and even flipping on and off light switches. The walls here are thin as sheets of paper. When people walk on the upper level, they create vibrations to the room below. Thus, I requested for a room change the next day because we had trouble sleeping the first night. The next day, a staff promised us to give us an upgrade to a quiet room. Tonight I’m at room 52, it is a much bigger room with high ceiling. However, we are right next to a very busy street. Cars, motorcycles and ambulances are very loud all night long. Additionally, random people could walk next to our window so we could hear random conversations. It doesn’t feel safe at all and it feels like we are just sleeping on the street with a bed. As a result, this room is a much noiser than room 204. It’s now 1:09am and I’m going to have another restless night here.

Service is good here, hotel is clean but it is not a 4-star hotel at all as described from the other reviews. Rooms are organized very oddly throughout the building, they are not convenient for anybody with lots of luggages. It doesn’t worth the price and will not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.",1,2019,03,01
100,Lovely 4* not far from tram stop,"Would definitely recommend this to anyone whom doesn't want to stay right in the centre of Amsterdam! It is possible to walk to the centre - but it takes around 20-30 minutes. Buy a GVB pass and use the tram, the hotel is less than 10 minutes from the nearest tram stop. 

Located in a beautiful setting overlooking the Park - the hotel offers bike rental and a gorgeous Café (not coffeeshop - make sure you know the difference!) where you can sit by the fire, or enjoy the weather outside like we did!

Hotel is gorgeous, the room was massive - but I was a little sad we didn't get one of the famous two floored rooms! Had a problem with the shower not draining, but it was sorted that day! Also did start hammering above us at 9am, but that was our fault for not being morning people.

Would love to stay again!",4,2019,02,27
100,The perfect stay,"Very easy to get to from the airport via public transport! 
We was greeted by friendly staff at the desk to check-in, we was early but no room available yet to which they offered to hold are cases in a locker for us which was very handy. When we came back at 3pm they offered us a free upgrade to a two story room which was lovely! 
The location of the hotel was brilliant, we had a few routes we could have taken to get into central Amsterdam.   ",5,2019,02,27
100,Nice vacation,"Nice place, nice room, confortaible room e Parck near hotel, we hope ti back in the same hotel if visit again Amsterdam, thancks alot for hospitality, i suggest the hotel for everythink for position,price e confort",4,2019,02,26
100,Absolutely beautiful hotel,Only stayed here for one night with my boyfriend but checking in and out could not have been easier and our 2 tier room was beautiful. About a 35 minute walk into the centre but with beautiful scenery it wasn’t a problem to us. Would definitely stay here again,5,2019,02,26
100,Nice,Lovely hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend for his birthday. We did find it a little far out but if you dont mind getting trams and walking a bit then its fine. The area itself is very pretty. The hotel staff were friendly and nice. If you like your tea bring tea bags and milk as none supplied. No bin in room except for bathroom. Our room was nice but small with a gorgeous view over the water and park. The room was split in two...Downstairs was tiny and the stairs leading up to bedroom are quiet awkward but the room itself was nice with a big bed. The staff also left a bottle of prosecco and birthday card and balloons which was really thoughtful. Overall its a lovely hotel with nice staff. No real complaints other than a few small picky things.,4,2019,02,25
100,"Awesome, very cool, hotel","I loved this hotel. The building, a former orphanage, looks classical, even gothic, while the rooms inside are modern. The restaurant serves nice meals, albeit expensive. And the grounds are unbeatable, being it is located as part of the Oosterpark, so the area around the hotel is gorgeous. The tram comes right down the street next to the facility, and it is located very near the hospital (OLVG), which is why we moved there midway in the trip, as one of our party was hospitalized. Iliana was especially helpful at making sure that we were well taken care of. The only negative would be the bathroom ""wall"" is actually tinted glass, so when the bathroom is lit, the bathroom is not private (at least in the room we had), and while the rooms up the stairs are veryt beautiful, they certainly are not for the elderly or those with a handicap. Otherwise, this is our hotel for any Amsterdam visits!",5,2019,02,25
100,Interesting Historical Hotel,Old orphan school building changed to a modern hotel inside a cool park.  Very large modern rooms with high ceilings. Has large bathroom but hard to use the sink and shower. No minibar and water in the room. Good breakfast in a nice Restaurant/Bar area.,4,2019,02,18
100,Interesting trip,"Me and my wife stopped in this hotel in Mid February. The hotel is in a very nice setting at the head of a fair sized park and in a quite part of Amsterdam. Access to public transport is quite good and its quite easy to get to the center.
The staff that welcomed us to the hotel were very pleasant and helpful, giving us advice on transport and things to do. I must admit to having been slightly disappointed when arriving in the room to find out that we had 2 single beds pushed together especially as they moved apart if you got too close with me slowly sliding down the gap between the 2.
Apart from that, the room was pleasant enough although I do have one issue. Upon arriving in the room I decided to go to the toilet which is located at the end of the room behind a glass door/wall. However I didn't realize the door was shut and went into the door full force, cutting my nose and having it bleed. I hit it so hard that I honestly thought it was broken. Now I admit that I probably wasn't concentrating enough having had my wallet stolen at the airport however I would imagine that I,m not the first to have done this. I would imagine that it would be wise to put something on the door to make it easier for people to spot it.
Its quite easy to see that it could happen to others.
Despite that mishap, we had a very good stay at the hotel and the staff were all very nice and the bar area and food was great.
I would certainly recommend the hotel but would just suggest that your aware of the doors or that the hotel put something there to make sure that your attention is drawn to this.",4,2019,02,18
100,BEAUTIFUL!!!,"I booked this hotel as a Christmas present for my boyfriend, I was a bit weary as some reviews said the hotel was different from the pictures but our room was amazing! I was expecting two single beds that we had to put together but we had a HUGE queen size bed, so soft and comfy! There’s a tv too with English channels and you’re given a phone to take out with you to find and tell you about attractions that you can visit! The hotel is a VERY easy 10 minute walk to the metro to get to the Centraal and the metro takes about 3-4 mins to get there. The staff were lovely and helped us with anything we asked, we ordered room service and I have never tasted such an amazing burger and chips, the flavours were unbelievable!! We were able to leave our suitcases in coded lockers on the last day as our flight wasn’t until late at night. The hallways and corridors were beautiful and the light shades added character to the building! The lake outside the building creates a beautiful atmosphere when you walk outside the hotel. Our experience was amazing! (Also the shower was super powerful I felt very clean after using it!) Thankyou so much for your amazing hospitality!!",5,2019,02,07
100,"Feels fancy, lovely staff, great atmosphere","The hotel is about a 25 minute walk from town which feels like no time among all the canals!

Inside, the hotel has an upmarket feel, everything is dark wood and marble with impressive feature staircases. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful.

We arrived an hour after our check-in time and the room wasn't yet ready but they immediately apologised and gave us free drinks at the bar which was a nice touch. The bar has quite a fancy feel but is a really relaxing place to grab a drink etc.

The room had a huge bed with very high ceilings, a tall window, a great walk-in-shower bathroom and a small tea set. It felt like a nicely finished room and was well cleaned with complementary toiletries. The only downside was the lack of spare pillows as just two small ones for a huge bed with a slightly wobbly wooden headboard was not the most comfortable if you're just lounging around!",4,2019,02,06
100,Quiet In The Storm,"I booked this hotel as the accommodation for a trip for my friend and I to see Amsterdam for the first time. From the maps, I thought it would be a little further out but found that it was very handy to get to Centraal and the main attractions in the city. The hotel is situated within a park and this makes a lovely entrance and gives a very suburban feel to a hotel which is pretty much just outside of all the hustle and bustle. The staff were very friendly and the hotel is very clean. The decor is fantastic, it gives a very romantic feel. I think the whole chapel vibe really pertains to this. We stayed in a twin room and the room was a little small with not much storage but the duplex element gave a more spacious feel. One note; the bathrooms are more of a glass partition and might be a little bit adventurous for the shy folk amongst us, but they are stylish, so fashion over function is the tone here. The shower is also very slippy so have to have your wits about you! But these are minor things. I think this hotel is perfect for couples and also for travellers who want to see the real Amsterdam. Rather than getting drunk and staying all day in the coffee shops, this is a great base to visit the city and come back to a very tranquil environment.",5,2019,02,03
100,Mixed feelings,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel previously and were excited for our trip back. We absolutely loved the setting, the park, the cafe and common areas and the room we had previously was great. The double level room was nice (although I agree the stairs could be challenging if you are not sort).
This time our trip was disappointing. We’d booked a park king (which is an upgraded room). Our flight was early and we were happy that when we arrived our room was ready, as we were super exhausted from a long flight. However upon checking in, our room was not as expected. It was in the older part of the hotel and on the ground floor. Despite having high ceilings, it felt as though we were staying in a basement as none of the windows were below 6 feet, meaning no view out to our park view room. It was extremely cold, and the heating system could not keep up and was very noisy. The plumbing has maybe not been upgraded in this part of the hotel and the hot water kept cutting in and out. There was a tiny dark cold sitting room apart from the bedroom, which was not a place you’d want to hang out. Additionally the paint was peeling in the bathroom and the walls of the room were scuffed.
Unfortunately the room would not heat up and we asked to be moved.
The room we were moved to was in the new part and much closer to the experience our first experience at the hotel, however it was annoying to have to move.
It is very important upon checking in that you ensure the room you are placed in is the room you actually booked. It seems the staff is either unconcerned with the specifics of your booking or trying to pass off lesser rooms at a higher cost.
Parts of this hotel are in a very old which has issues and there is not much that can be done- these rooms should not be the same rate as those that are new or have been more extensively renovated.
Additionally there are thoughtful touches missing from the rooms such as toiletries, extra pillows (2 pillows on a king bed is insufficient), extra towels and face clothes, bottles of water in the room, stocked minibar, good in room coffee machines (rather than packets of cheap instant), full length mirrors, better shower enclosure that doesn’t  flood the bathroom, better housecleaning attention (remove scuffs on walls,stains on carpet) etc that you’d expect at this price point considering the limited facilities (ie no gym, pool, spa, location far from centre).
Love the cafe and design details of the main areas but the rooms and service fall seriously short. I hope management is able to pull it together as this property is not living up to its potential.",2,2019,02,02
100,Amsterdam in December,"My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Amsterdam for my birthday and he booked the Arena Hotel through EasyJet holidays so we didn’t know what to expect. Although we turned up and the hotel couldn’t find our booking, we were lucky the hotel still had rooms available and the hotel staff did everything they could to make it up to us, they were really friendly and welcoming. I love Amsterdam and it was even better in December, everywhere was so Christmassy and looked lovely. 

Our hotel room was on two floors, which I’ve never come across before, everything in the room was state of the art and brand new. As we walked out of the hotel there was a cafe/restaurant on the side, which has a lovely interior, we walked out into a park, which I could imagine would look lovely in the summer/snow. 

Although it was a bit far out of the main centre, we got the tram in every morning, it is walking distance f about half an hour to the red Light District district but a bit cold in December!

Will definitely be returning when it’s a bit warmer and would recommmend this hotel to anyone, couldn’t fault anything.",5,2019,02,02
100,Highly recommend ,"This was one of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in at such a good price. The unusual layout of the bedrooms really appealed to us with the bathroom downstairs as you walk in the door, a small seating area and desk and upstairs one of the comfiest beds ever and a flat screen tv. Also accompanying our room was a smart phone which gave you free calls to EU people and free internet and free maps to use around the city while you stayed. 
The staff were so so friendly and helpful in every way possible. There were lockers there to store our luggage in for free when we arrived as we arrived early and our rooms weren’t ready and we used them again when we were leaving as check out was at 11:30 and we had an evening flight. 
Overall, such a lovely stay. ",5,2019,01,16
100,Really Nice hotel.,"We stayed for 4 days over Christmas. We were checked in to a duplex room, with the bed upstairs, these are are a little precarious so I'd suggest requesting a room all on 1 floor if you have trouble with stairs.

The first night we found that the temperature in the room was incredibly warm (just for me, other's might not find it that warm), and we were unable to adjust the AC any lower that we had it, due to it being on winter settings. We asked reception to find us a fan, and when they couldn't they immediately offered to move our room (and even upgraded us as an apology for the inconvenience).

Everything throughout the hotel was clean and tidy and the bar / restaurant is fantastic.

All in all, a great hotel. If your expecting boutique style luxury, its not for you. You wont get luxury coffee machines in your room, or posh miniature toiletries (who needs these anyway! think of all that plastic!)  But if you want a comfortable hotel, with friendly staff, in a great location you cant go wrong. 
We will definitely stay here again!",4,2019,01,11
100,Lovely hotel great staff ,I stayed at this hotel over the weekend with my boyfriend. It is located within a beautiful park and the hotel itself is stunning. Our room was a decent size as well as the bathroom. Staff were friendly and polite. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2019,01,07
100,great city stay,"great location with good links to metro and tram lines, service was great on arrival we were early but was advised that we could store our luggage in the lockers at reception (this was great for our last day to check out early then carry on exploring) rooms were clean however only one complaint was that we had requested rooms together but ended up being split up. one room was in the new wing and however nice the rooms look the duplex stairs are a bit unsafe during the night and located right by the delivery bay - this meant that you were constantly woken up by noise and pallet trucks. the second room was located in one of the old wings, room was great and spacious however you did hear every single noise and the drainage system smelt very unpleasant. but again for a city hotel and the history behind the building this was a great stay and we would 100% recommend.",4,2019,01,02
100,A lovely place to stay !💖,"For a perfect start in the day you should try the fresh breakfast even when it costs 21 , it is worth it ! You feel energized for the whole day 2 discover Amsterdam .the  nice Parc surrounding the hotel is perfect for a walk  to escape the city stress, just a few minutes away from the centre.for my friend and me the location was perfect !The course menu on our first day completed our stay perfectly and we really look forward to our next stay ...thanks 💖",5,2019,01,01
100,Excellent Christmas Break,"Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Arena. Can't fault it!! Such a beautiful location, helpful staff, wonderful restaurant and our room was great!! 

Whilst staying at the hotel we also rented bikes and could book excursions directly from here. The case lockers were also handy. 

Would definitley recommend!!",5,2018,12,31
100,Arena adventures ...,"This is a beautiful hotel, stunning interior design and tastefully in keeping with the original architecture, both inside and out ... but when booking to stay here, best not to ask them to think outside the box.  We came as three friends for a school reunion, and we had asked for a triple room.  We had been told that there would be a costly upgrade for this, which we agreed to.  We also asked for an early check-in (our flights landed at 9am), but were told that this might be possible, but depending on how early, there would be an extra charge.  We eventually took our time in the morning in town and arrived at approx 13:30.  We tried to book-in, but were told it was too early.  We mentioned that we had asked for an early(ish) check-in, but were told it was impossible - no discussion.  A bit disheartened, we went to the restaurant (very nice and luckily not too expensive), and had a snack and a drink and waited til the official time of 15:00.  We were then welcomed more warmly by Reception, got our key and went to our room ... it was a shock to discover only two twin beds, two sets of towels, two mugs, a bathroom door that didin't close properly, a sofa that was on the verge of collapse, no heating on and the window not closed properly, so it was freezing cold.  We went back down to reception and explained that this couldn't possibly be our room ... but yes, it was, just that there had been a misunderstanding with ""house management"" about setting it up as a triple with an extra bed.  However, we couldn't imagine where they were going to squeeze in this extra bed, so we asked to see some other rooms, but were told that a bigger room would mean a bigger price for the upgrade, which seemed unfair - especially as we were already experiencing inconvenience !  So we viewed some other rooms in the same corridor, which were even smaller, which meant we were stuck with our original room - the representative of the ""house management"" even exclaimed that he couldn't understand why we had been allocated such a small room for a triple.  In the end, and after all sorts of ins and outs, the bed arrived, the extra mug arrived, the reception staff acknowledged the coldness of the room and fixed the window, even the sofa was repaired by a technician ... finally, by the time we were sorted, it was at least 17:30, so we had wasted a whole afternoon ... never once did anyone say 'SORRY', and no compensation or even 'free' gesture was offered - it would have been very simple to try and win us back over, but instead we were left feeling very disappointed ...

Otherwise, the rest of our two-night stay went well, and we had a good time, so it was a real shame that our arrival was such a let-down.

But I'd still recommend the hotel for future guests, it must be lovely to just arrive, be shown to one of their designer rooms and relax ...!",4,2018,12,30
100,Lovely location but Arena didn’t  live up to my expectations.,"I’ve been wanting to stay at the Arena for at least 10 or 15 years since seeing an article about it in a design magazine ( probably something wanky like Wallpaper) and thought it would be a nice luxurious environment to relax in especially if the weather turned bad. 

Upon arrival we were asked to pay upfront - it almost felt as though they didn’t trust us. I tried to explain that my salary was going in to my account the next day so it would suit me better to pay then but I was told we had to pay in full on arrival. Not a good start. 

Then the rooms. If you go based on photos online you would expect a lovely designer / boutique style room but my companions room felt quite tired and in need of redecoration - also she had no free toiletries provided - just hand soap fixed to the wall. Only two or so tea bags etc and poor quality coffee coupled with no milk definitely added to the sense of staying in budget 2-3 star accommodation rather than anything luxury or boutique. The bed was very comfortable and the WiFi worked well. 

My room had a ridiculously steep staircase to access the sleeping platform - seriously if you were drunk / on something it would have been very very dangerous. The bed was really comfy so I did sleep very well but I felt that as half the room was downstairs that I may as well have been in a much smaller pod type room as my view in the morning was a close up of the ceiling and the tv. Nipping downstairs to use the loo took great care given the nature of the staircase- maybe a pee potty beside the bed would be a good back up plan for those wishing to have a few drinks. 

My bathroom was large and the free toiletries were basic but of adequate quality. I liked having the kettle to use but bought my own filter and ground coffee as I hate instant but having decent coffee and milk provided as standard would have made it feel a more luxurious experience. The furniture / decor was nice but not exceptional. 

I’ve stayed in much more beautiful hotels in Japan & elsewhere for less money. In fact my main point of reference for boutique / art hotels is the Anteroom in Kyoto which is a similar price but way above this AND included full buffet breakfast ( as well as some seriously luxury bath products) as well as being immaculate- which I’m sorry to say the Arena isn’t. (Holes & marks on the walls where things / shelves have been removed are just left rather than filled in / painted etc.) 

I’m glad I tried the Arena but I think the pictures online are misleading - if you do choose to stay here ask to see your room first before you pay and make sure you are happy with it. I wish I had done that now rather than having three nights in a room that fell way below my expectations.",3,2018,12,27
100,Low quality and too expensive ,We booked a suite for 2 nights (euro 450) and got a room that was looking like a youth hostel room. We asked for a nice view and were on the ground floor next to main road. No whirlpool like written in the confirmation. Everywhere in the room we little reparation works were. Windows could not be opened. Bad air in the room. Shower was broken. The hotel is not on a 4 star level. Max . 2-3 stars. We rented bikes that were broken. We had the feeling that nobody in the hotels feels responsable. Don’t know if it was ever on a top/good level..but definitely it needs now urgently a complete refinish and a new more motivated management and employees. We were very dissapointed.,2,2018,12,25
100,Different room,"The hotel is situated about 20 to 25 minutes walk from Amsterdam Centraal railway station, there are good transport links, whether it be tram or tube.
Situated within the Ooster park, the hotel is clean and well presented. With an attached restaurant/bar.

We stayed in a duplex type room see photos. The room is starting to look a little bit old and you can see from the toilet into the lounge area through smoked glass which may be disconcerting for some.

Whilst there was a television upstairs in the bedroom area it would perhaps be nice to have one downstairs as well.

Staff were pleasant and amenable.

Plenty to do in Amsterdam and actually we enjoyed the walk back from the main area in the evening to the hotel.

Would definitely recommend this hotel.

It is worth noting that on checkout we were required to pay a tourist tax which was not included in our flight hotel package price. 

",4,2018,12,16
100,It Could Have Been So Much Better,"Travellers beware. This hotel is not as depicted. Yes, it's in an historic building located in a beautiful park, in a lovely neighbourhood close to the tram and metro. But that's as good as it gets. 

The room we booked - a courtyard double - looked inviting online. However, what we got was not as depicted. It's hard to believe that the hotel was renovated in 2017 because it's looking very shabby. Scuff marks everywhere, chipped entry doors, unpainted patch walls. 

After agreeing to pay for an upgrade, our next room was not much better. Since there was no dresser or cabinet provided, we had no choice but to stack our clothes on top of the desk for six days. Each time we had a shower, water would leak all over the bathroom floor. The mattresses were flimsy and the pillows worn. There were so many design oversights in our room. Housekeeping service was sporadic. 

When I shared my comments with the hotel staff, I received an apology. But there was no follow-up from management. I departed with the impression that our business was of no value. I suggest that if you are considering this hotel, take your business elsewhere. Amsterdam is not inexpensive, but there must be so many better options to choose from.",2,2018,12,14
100,Amazing Hotel ,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Absolutely gorgeous hotel!!!! We stayed in a duplex room. . It had rained heavy during the day and when we got back to the room around 6pm we noticed a leak had come in above the TV. We went to reception and he immediately insisted on changing rooms and an upgrade to a better duplex room. It was lovely, unnecessary but it was great they just trusted us and wanted us to move. 
There are plenty of tram bus and metro stops around and the park is lovely to walk around during the day and night. The breakfast is all you can eat and a very very wide selection. Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend.  There are restaurants very close by which are lovely. We went to one called Mississippi and the food was fantastic. ",5,2018,12,14
100,Historical and Large Hotel in Former Orphanage,"Hotel Arena had the name before the Amsterdam ArenA stadium so they won the court case! And hence are still called Arena. It is a very large converted orphanage with 164 rooms, a big church-like chapel which can be used as a music venue, and their own popular restaurant called Park. There is also covered parking. There is a bit of street noise in the room and TV and coffee set are a bit outdated. But overall a very interesting place to stay and potentially organise events.",4,2018,12,12
100,Hotel Arena,the localtion of the hotel is very good. Bus and tram stop is very close to the hotel and the downtown is only 10 minutes by tram. Breakfast is very good and the dinner too. Rooms are not very cleaned. Staff is good.,3,2018,12,12
100,Mr,Very good hotel was really impressed with the restaurant area and food was great .. my only complain was the extremely thin walls that divide rooms and corridors . We literally could hear everything going off all through the night . Staff was brilliant too very polite ppl .,4,2018,12,12
100,Wonderful hotel in a rainy city,"Me and my partner have just stayed in the hotel arena for 3 nights as a birthday present for her, we booked a king room and were given a room on the third floor.  
It was beautiful.   The bed was one of the comfiest beds I’ve ever slept in and the room was big and had plenty of storage and a wonderful bathroom with a free standing bath and a shower and a veiw of the courtyard in the middle.  As it is an old building the floors are a little squeaky so we could hear when people were to walk past the room but this didn’t cause any issues and kinda added to the charm of the place.  

The restaurant was loverly and breakfast was a good mix of tasty stuff but be careful the cocktails add up and you might end up spending a bit more than you thought! Though they are worth every penny.",5,2018,12,12
100,Gorgeous,"Absolutly stunning hotel for couples!! So posh and friendly and very accomodating!! The rooms are so funky and stunning for a couple for a weekend away ;)

We travelled for my partners birthday and the staff were so accommodating even offering to set up rose petals and balloons. The restaurant attached is also lovely. ",5,2018,12,04
100,Cosy and comfortable,We had a wonderful and comfortable stay in a double room which was a good size and very clean. Recommended for couples and families alike. The park right in front of the hotel is a bonus and is great for a run in the morning.Hotel might be a little farther from the city centre but that is to its advantage as it is quiet and tranquil at night with a brilliant pub/cafe at the ground floor of the hotel. ,5,2018,12,04
100,need  a little tlc in bathroom,also we had to leave a day earlier no refund    Expedia  said it was up the hotel we ask  they it was Expedia not true the staff was great front desk  great food and location the location in the park adds to its location,5,2018,12,04
100,Winter Break,"Fabulous hotel , lovely setting.   I would skip breakfast which was very disappointing.   Staff were vey friendly, I loved the 'handy mobile phone'  which was free for use during our stay.  room was lovely, though a little cool and we were unable to locate the thermostat!",4,2018,12,03
100,Great place,"This is a great hotel and it's our second time we have stayed in this hotel, the room is great with huge windows so a lot of natural light, there where a few issues with lights not working, nothing major",5,2018,12,03
100,Great Hotel great location direct to a great park but ohh hotels rooms are cold and dirt,"The room was not very clean, some products were missing, bed room dirty from previous guest with cola or coffee stains...dirty behind the bed and the room was cold, no heater in the bathroom, we told the hotel reception no comment to this ??? Also the mattress needs to be replaced as they hanging through!!",3,2018,12,03
100,Book for the Park,"First, the good. Location is perfect if you like parks. It's within the park, so you can take a stroll. Artis Zoo is also walking distance.  

Restaurant has good food, good ambience, and quick service. You also get a Handy phone, in your room, which is useful, if you need to go to the city center and need googlemaps.

It's a good walk to the tram service, and there's no metro nearby.

If you have luggage, it's a bit of a struggle going up, to the hotel lobby (entrance is at the back, thru the park).

There's no toiletries, except for soap. Found out the next day, you have to ask the reception.

No complimentary water so bring your own. Also no grocery store nearby, so be prepared.

Corridors are dimly lit -- which makes you think about how the mental patients/orphans who lived there back in the day.

100,Great stay,"Fantastic hotel, very friendly, lovely rooms and close to the city, nice vieuw over the park wenn u have a drink or dinner in the restaurant. For sure we will come back in the summerr to enjoy the park and the great ambiance",5,2018,12,01
100,Business Stay in Hotel Arena,"Stayed in this hotel for business purposes. Hotel was really nice, rooms were better than expected, food quality was great. Only problem was really slow service in the lunches and dinners. My group were eating in the hotel restaurant several times and slow service happened every time. Service was really friendly, but they forgot every time to deliver ordered drinks or side dishes + for example lunch was taking 1hour to get food ordered from lunch menu, which typically should be fast that customers can get out in 1 hour. So we needed to spend 1,5 hours to take lunch, which was too much.  Also personally I was expecting to have more selection of pillows than only one really thick ones what were in the room. If the service could have been better, I would have give 4 points.",3,2018,11,30
100,Best  hotel in Amsterdam,"The hotel is located in a  beautiful Parke. next to 4 lines of tram so it is very easy to go any where in Amsterdam. The front desk service is very good, very clean and the bed are comfortable.there is a comfy Cort yard at the hotel that you can smoke in. The hotel provides a electronic divide called handy that had Google maps and internet so you can find your way anywhere in Amsterdam ",5,2018,11,29
100,"Views over the park, exceptional service and incredible food","This is my second visit to Hotel Arena and I have loved it both times. As a frequent visitor to Amsterdam for work and pleasure, Hotel Arena has to tick every box. 
The breakfast is wonderful, staff cannot do enough to help you, the cocktails are gorgeous and views over the park, even on a rainy day are wonderful. This is a hotel for people not wanting to track the tourist route. Great location, takes you to the ‘locals Amsterdam’ by foot and the tram is just outside. 

Thank you!",5,2018,11,29
100,Hotel Arena,"The building design, layout & history is very interesting and the facilities are very good.  The staff were very efficient and helpful.  Although not very central, we were able to walk to everywhere within 40 minutes - and it's a good thing to walk because the food is very good in Amsterdam.",4,2018,11,25
100,Beautiful and professional hotel,"Nice, relaxed spot in busy Amsterdam next to a large city park. Excellent breakfast with a view on the park. All rooms are different, but are nicely done and have a relaxed atmosphere. The garage under the hotel is also a plus",5,2018,11,25
100,Disappointed,Very few helpful staff and front of desk don't communicate with each other. It's unfortunate as the hotel and the hotels story is beautiful but the staff let it down massively only few good staff.....,2,2018,11,24
100,Incredible hotel with fantastic staff.,"Despite arriving at the hotel at 10am (check in was at 3), the front desk promptly provided with a clean room within minutes. The room itself was gorgeous with two floors and more than enough room and any special requests were just an easy phone call away. ",5,2018,11,22
100,OLVG visit,"Great location, good service, expensive parking. One night at the hotel for a business trip to OLVG. Breakfast is not cheap but of good quality and variety. OK, you're not in the city center, but it is convenient enough to access by car.",4,2018,11,21
100,"Hotel Arena - Lovely Staff, OK Room","All OK, just a little shabby round the edges (peeling wallpaper, black mould in the bathroom etc) Staff were lovely though, and the park is nice. 'Takes about 25 minutes to get into the centre of town by tram.",3,2018,11,20
100,very seminar based hotel,"Seems like the hotel exists only for seminars and groupsFound it to be more 3* However, a big thumps up for the electronic guide gadget at disposal in the room and to bring out tooNice building easily connected with public transport",3,2018,11,20
100,Excellent trip,Great stay and lovely hotel set in a very picturesque park with a short walk to the metro line. Shame we only stayed one night! The rooms were clean and modern and would highly recommend. We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we were only there one night but looked fabulous and regret not trying it out!,5,2018,11,20
100,Buisines stay,Nice different hotel with a good ambiance modern restaurant friendly service good atmosphere and quality  roomscould be bit warmer  the lift is very slow and the loud bang of the fire doors of the rooms can be very annoying when sleeping and other guests move around the corridors ,4,2018,11,18
100,One of my favourite hotels,"Hotel Arena is just perfect, located in a beautiful park, the building itself resembles a church (it was a church and an orphanage before it was built into a hotel).

My special thanks go to the staff, especially the reception - you are just amazing, not just polite, but sincerely friendly and super helpful.

And last, but not least - the restaurant is delicious!

If I come back to Amsterdam, I will definitely stay at Hotel Arena again.",5,2018,11,16
100,Attending the Global Cultural Leadership Programme,"Had the best experiences and hospitality ever! The rooms, services, friendly staff and the beautiful park were just something else. This was really an out of this world experience! Thank you, I would stay at Hotel Arena on my next visit to Amsterdam again!",5,2018,11,15
100,Great Hotel - Great Location,"A great hotel away from the hustle and bustle, but within striking distance of the city and all the key places of interest. Great location in the park makes it a peaceful and relaxing stay.  Good transport links, great rooms and welcoming staff. I wouldn't hesitate to book again. ",5,2018,11,15
100,Good Value,"Hotel Arena is in a great location for walking in the adjacent park, taking a short tram ride into the center or visiting the general hospital. The staff is welcoming and the cafe/restaurant is inviting.  The cafe/restaurant is used by local families and pleasantly busy. ",4,2018,11,14
100,Lovely place,Lovely hotel in a beautiful location on the edge of a park. Easy 4-5 minute walk from the tram and then 15 minutes to anywhere else you would want to go. Hotel is as good as the pictures make it look.,5,2018,11,13
100,Amazing!,"Amazing hotel, location, rooms, staff.Beautiful location right in Oosterpark.Convenient for tram and public transport.Lockers available to store luggage once, checked out, which are huge and secure!Will be staying again for sure!",5,2018,11,13
100,Great design and confort,"A perfect hotel for a short or long stay at Amsterdam. It has everything yo need for lovely stay and a beautiful park just outside of the hotel. The rooms are very confortable, good size beds and staff very friendly.",5,2018,11,12
100,Great Hotel,"The room comes with a mobile phone that has free international and local calling abilities as well as internet and navigation. You can take the phone with you when you leave the room and around town, came in very handy. Additionally, the room decor was excellent, very stylish, the beds were comfortable.Overall I was highly impressed with the hotel.",5,2018,11,12
100,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is situated in a park, so the setting is serene.  The hotel itself, is gorgeous.  Have a good bar/restaurant.  The room is clean and bed/s are comfortable. Felt like a very upscale hotel for a moderate price!",5,2018,11,07
100,Excellent hotel at good location,"This is a superb hotel near the Oosterpark, Tropenmuseum and Artis. They have great split-level rooms. The staff is very welcoming and helpful, except for one small thing: when we arrived, the bedroom part of our room was very warm. We asked about it, but nobody came. Breakfast is also great.",5,2018,11,05
100,Ideal moment in Amsterdam,"Arena Hotel is a really nice place. Right in front of a Park, the ""Suite"" we had the pleasure to experienced had a amazing vue and the comfort was excellent.Very clean room, super comfortable bed, fully equipped bathroom, nothing is missing to enjoy a long we in Amsterdam.The service is excellent and we will keep a wonderful memory of Paulette at the front desk.Thx again!!!",5,2018,11,05
100,Great location and rooms!,"Staff were very friendly and the room was excellent. Only problem was during the night if it rained, the room was in the attic, it was very loud. Nothing to be done, more just and observation. The location is brilliant with great transport links very close by and a lovely park on the doorstep.",5,2018,10,31
100,"A quiet, enjoyable stay at Hotel Arena",Hotel Arena has lovely modern rooms in a beautiful old church.  Very comfortable beds made our stay  enjoyable.. The beautiful setting overlooking Oosterpark allowed us peace after busy days of touring.,5,2018,10,29
100,Not worthy of 4 star rating,"We had multiple issues in our room which were not resolved satisfactorily during our stay. We had to repeatedly ask for cleaning to come to our room and for towels for all guests (we had three for the final two nights and paid for the extra bed and room upgrade charges). We only ever got 3 sets of towels on Sunday morning when we were about to check out… The shower drain was backing up into the washroom and we brought this to the front desk's attention on several occasions but no one from maintenance attended over the 4 night stay.There was a kettle, but nowhere nearby to plug it in. Likewise at the desk, you had to unplug the desk lamp to plug in a computer or other device, so you’d be working in the dark. The fridge was leaking water the whole time. The shower drain was backing up into the washroom and we brought this to the front desk's attention on several occasions but no one from maintenance attended. I also emailed all these concerns to the management after our stay without any reply. Pretty weak. For a 4 star hotel the attention to detail was quite poor -- applied to all areas. I understand it was a busy weekend with ADE, but that's what brought us to Amsterdam. When running around for my business meetings I don't think it's fair for the guest to have to constantly remind the hotel of basic obligations (clean towels, sheets, shower draining, fridge leaking, no extra power, lack of follow up).I hope you can do better in the future. In my opinion, this was not up to the standard of any 4 star I've stayed in before.",2,2018,10,29
100,Worst experience ever in a hotel,Worst customer service. None of the staff did any effort to assist customers. I was there for business but the room was overlooking the mainroad and it was impossible to concentrate on work or sleep. Front desk and breakfast receptionists need a crash course on customer satisfaction and how to deal with customers. It was not an issue of a language barrier but of attitude. I do not recommand at all.,1,2018,10,28
100,"Marie-Anne & Pat (Donegal, Ireland)","This hotel is a hidden gem in Amsterdam.Within 15-20 mins walking distance from city centre in beautiful tranquil surroundings of the park.Ideal place to come back and chill after a days sightseeing/shopping.Lovely terrace bar/restaurant with great food.Very comfy bed and room and bathroom spotlessStaff were superb, very helpful and kind and always with a smile, nothing was a bother to them. They took great pride in their work and were so well presented.Free travel buddy in room to take with you touring about which was a great ideaLoved this hotel and probably the best we’ve stayed in, will definitely be back.Thanks to all staff in Hotel Arena that made our city break a great one!",5,2018,10,26
100,Spacious room - great location,"The hotel is situated in a beautiful park - with tram access walking distance away.The trams run directly to the Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum, as well as providing easy access to Lelylaan station which takes you to the airportThe staff were friendly and the café/bar offered a nice chill out area.A mixture of grand and modern, the spacious room offered a big bed, large bathtub and peaceful nights stay",5,2018,10,25
100,Excellent hotel,"The hotel was absolutely fantastic! The breakfast was wonderful and the view of the park from the restaurant was incredible. The location of the hotel was very near to the city center, and that was convenient for our short stay. ",5,2018,10,24
100,"Nice, clean, hotel","This hotel was clean and I liked how they have lockers if you are too early to check in or if you're staying past check out. It was a bit far from the city center though. The bathroom walls are see through, which does not make sense to me. And there is no full wall from the shower to the rest of the bathroom, so the floor and toilet can get wet when you shower. The place was clean and spacious though. ",4,2018,10,24
100,Not Recommended!!,"I was so looking forward to stay at the Hotel Arena as the building looked captivating from the pictures. Unfortunately, to my and my partner's surprise it was nothing near our expectations.  
Reception was way too far from the main entrance and in order to get the lift to our room we had to walk through a very narrow hallway. Both days of our staying the hallway was full of people. Some were sitting on chairs watching videos on a screen and some others were using VR glasses and moving around awkwardly. It was very difficult for us to pass through and had to apologise every time we wanted to cross the hallway in order reach the lift that would take us to our room. Same thing when we had to leave our room. I really can not understand why the hotel would not offer a meeting room to these people, rather than blocking the narrow hallway that was the only way to the lift or stairs. 
Moving on, we stayed in the Village King-Studio . There was not a lot of natural light and the bathroom had a very bad smell that was spreading all over the room. The room was also cold and there was no option of changing the temperature on the radiator. We tried to use the aircon instead and adjust it on a high temperature, but the only thing that was coming out of it was cold air, even though we left it on for a while. The TV was very old and located on the end of the bed, which made it uncomfortable to sleep as we always had in mind to be careful not to knock it down. During the night the hallway in front of our room was quiet, but during the daytime very noisy. Not great if you wanted to sleep an extra hour or relax in the afternoon. 
Finally, on our first night, I went to the bar to ask for a bottle of still water to take along to the room. The bartender gave me a bottle of tap water instead and charged me 5.00 EUR for it!!! 5.00 EUR for a bottle of tap water?????? I have never experienced anything like that!
The only thing we enjoyed in the hotel was the breakfast, as we had a few options to choose from and the outside seating area that had a lovely view of the park. 
Overall, for the 524.00 EUR we paid (2 nights - Room including Breakfast), we were very unhappy with our stay at the Hotel Arena and we will not go back on our next visit to Amsterdam. We certainly expected much more from a 4 star hotel. Very disappointed!!!",2,2018,10,24
100,Worth the Spend,The room was incredible. Ours was a split-level. The hotel itself includes a conference room and restaurant and is built in the middle of a park. The views were great. The bathroom was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable. It’s worth every penny. ,5,2018,10,24
100,"Scenic, high quality place to stay","Lovely place, set in a park. It's a stunning architectural hotel that we'd highly recommend. The location is 800 from the metro and in a nice quiet part of the city but with quick access to the main attractions. Rooms are tidy, comfortable and modern. Would recommend.",5,2018,10,23
100,Nice get away,"Really nice hotel. 
Room are perfect with modern bathroom
Bar and restaurant are fantastic. 

Bit noisy at night but completely worth it. 
Seems a bit far away from the center of the city but it’s finally super easy (even with a baby)

Will definitely go back",4,2018,10,22
100,Recommended,"This is a unique, boutique type hotel. Each room is a bit different - some have very steep spiraling stairs. Ask at check in. Building has an interesting, long history. Located quite nicely at the Ooesterpark. Lots of restaurants are in walking distance. Seems to be a very family-friendly area. Restaurant is convenient,  but service is a bit slow - even though there is lots of staff. And seemed a bit uncoordinated (5 people waited on me vs one dedicated person - one took the order, one brought the order, two people checked on me, someone else for the bill...) whether I was eating alone or with a large group. Waited a while at the bar just to get a glass of wine. Breakfast buffet is excellent. ",4,2018,10,21
100,Lovely hotel but rooms need some attention,"Its was a lovely building in a nice location. The lobby area was impressive along with the park restaurant and view of the park. The room however was disappointing. We upgraded to a King Village room but slightly regretted that decision. The room looked tried which was surprising as i thought the rooms had been newly renovated. The carpet was fraying and coming up, the surfaces were dirty (bedside tables stained, a good clean would resolve this), the bathroom sink was also stained yellow and the sink tap was leaking heavily which meant i had to stuff a towel around the tap so the things on the side didn't get wet. The bathroom door also didn't shut (good few inches away!). We did speak to reception who were very friendly and said they'd send someone to look at the tap and the door. When we returned to our room later that day, the door issue had been resolved but the sink tap was still leaking and cleanliness was the same. I'm assuming someone looked at these other issues in our room but I wasn't notified so can't be certain. I don't usually like to leave negative reviews but the cost of the room was pretty pricey for the issues - you wouldn't expect these faults for the price of the room!! We also had breakfast one morning which was very pleasant but slightly overpriced again.",3,2018,10,19
100,NOT RECOMMENDED if you’re used to high standards,"This hotel is far from great. It clearly needs renovation here and there. It’s very unpractical, given that to reach your room you need to go through a labirynth. I was given a duplex room with a very steep and narrow staircase which is very inconvenient. Imagine having to go down everytime you’re super tired but you realised you forgot to grab your phone charger or anything else downstairs. It’s definitely not a great room to rest at. Additionaly, the room is very dark, so I’ve had the impression of being locked in a cellar even during the day. Tv is ancient and small. Air condittioning is either super hot or super cold. Water pressure in the shower is poor. Cleaning service POOR. Bed linen is supposed to be changed every 3 days but it never happened. Service at the restaurant is extremely slow even when it’s not busy. The girl at the reception was far from nice when I checked in. I received no explanation on breakfast time or pretty much anything else. I was carrying a lot of luggage and was not offered any help at all. Compared to other hotels that charge 200€ per night, this one is really poor.",2,2018,10,18
100,Arena,Excellent place to stay overlooking the park. Very friendly staff. Unfortunately all of their bikes were in need of repair so had to rent down the block. The room was a tad noisy in the morning being next to the hallway door. I will stay there again if I ever get back to Amsterdam.,5,2018,10,17
100,Spectacular Hotel,"Wonderful hotel with unique rooms, an amazing property, great amenities, and wonderful service. Would recommend staying here for just a night or for weeks at a time. The bedding was comfortable, shower was warm, and styling was rad. ",5,2018,10,17
100,Nice location in park but tired hotel,"Booking in process very slow only two desks. Room I stayed in was very small. Bathroom had no natural light very dark and small. Bed was above bathroom up some tiny steps not good for elderly people  or anyone that goes to the toilet a lot in the night. I nearly fell down the steps in the early hours. No drinks in mini bar room was very basic. Restaurant service very slow went to cafe up the road. I was here for only two days on business, not a hotel I would come back to or book for a holiday. Park was lovely to walk through.",2,2018,10,17
100,Great hotel,"Just back what a lovely hotel and lovely staff and rooms , from the moment i enter the park gates and see the hotel and the surrounding area i knew it was going to be a great stay thanks so much hotel arena ",4,2018,10,16
100,Nice property,"Great, modern hotel in a historical building. Lovely set-up with the mix of old and new elements, esp loved the old staircase. Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast buffet was nice. Loved the smoked mackerel and yogurt.  ",5,2018,10,15
100,Why not...? ,"As we were attending a party next door, we thought why not? So we booked a room in  Hotel Arena. We were super excited to stay here as they recently renovated the hotel. When one of us arrived, staff could be a bit friendlier at the reception. A reserve was made on one of our credit cards and an extra amount of €50,- was put on top, for the minibar. But when we arrived in the room there was an empty minibar?! Makes you wonder? The Authorisation reserve was also kept on the card for more than a week, which is not very nice when you are a frequent traveller. The room was reasonably spacious with high ceilings and a pretty OK view on the inner courtyard. The bathroom had tainted glass walls and is not entirely up to my personal liking. For the luxurious price we paid, the room did not entirely have that luxurious feeling to it, there were clear signs of heavy usage / damages on the floor and walls... but it was clean and comfortable. The breakfast is served downstairs in the restaurant that also has a very nice terrace outside looking onto the Oosterpark. For a little moment you may get a bit of New Yorks Central Park feeling.. but then I would not pay to stay at this hotel next time but rather limit it to just a walk through the park. ",3,2018,10,14
100,Thoroughly enjoyable stay at the edge of lush Oosterpark.,"Hotel Arena is located in Amsterdam's Oost district, not far from the city centre, and is easily accessible by public transport, bike or by walking. The hotel lies on the edge of a lush and spacious Oosterpark, which practically serves as its front yard. The building itself has an interesting history. During the first half of the 20th century served as a Catholic orphanage for girls and later as a mental hospital for women. The building was restored and converted into a luxurious hotel. The sprawling corridors can give it an eerie vibe, but I have the pleasure to confirm I have not encountered any ghost sightings during my three-night stay.  On the contrary, my stay was entirely enjoyable. 

I was assigned the Standard Duplex room - a split-level space, with living area and bathroom on the bottom and sleeping area with a king-sized bed on a mezzanine. The stairs are quite steep, as is usual in the Netherlands, so if you have mobility issues or are afraid of climbing to bed every night - ask the staff for a different type of room. The rooms are quite bright thanks to massive windows and feel very spacious despite a relatively small footprint. I would prefer to have some extra shelving or drawers to store my clothes in a more accessible manner.  The bathroom was very spacious and spotless. It must be a complete nightmare to keep those glossy black tiles clean, so kudos to the Housekeeping staff. 

The front of house staff, including the handsome waiting staff at the PARK bar, was very efficient and friendly. The breakfast was definitely one of the better ones I have experienced in recent years. It had a good selection of warm dishes, cold cuts, cheeses, fresh fruits, vegetables and bread. Everything was fresh and tasty. 

Also, the event rooms are bright and enjoyable, with lots of natural light and with access to the outside. 

Would I stay again? Certainly.  Would I recommend staying at the Hotel Arena to friends? I certainly would.",5,2018,10,13
100,Great stay,The hotel is great. Still a little bit confusing from all this corridors sometimes very tide- could get creepy especially when realise it was an orphenilage.Room are great still. Water is for drinking still there is no information about this. The bar is closing at 11 p.m. and when you are not aware about the water and your mini bar is empty and there is no store around it could be very inconvenient.,4,2018,10,13
100,"Great location, lovely hotel, excellent breakfast","This hotel is in a lovely location for exploring Amsterdam. On the edge of a large park, there are lovely grounds to view whilst enjoying breakfast or having afternoon drinks on the deck. I stayed in a duplex room, which had a view across the park and was cosy but comfortable for a weeks stay. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from 2 main tram lines so getting into and out of the centre is really quick. It takes about 10-12 minutes on the tram. The breakfast selection was certainly very good. A great hot and cold buffet arrangement with very nice coffee machines.  A nice touch is that there are large suitcase sized lockers which are free to use on your final day. As my flight was not until 9.30pm it meant I could enjoy the final day 'bag free' after checking out after breakfast and just collected my bags at the end of the day before catching the train to the airport.",5,2018,10,10
100,"Great Staff & breakfast, loud doors","Really a unique property, but wow it was hard to sleep with all of the slamming doors. I also was in a room with a clogged shower. The staff was very kind, but it does feel like it needs more investment in the property.",4,2018,10,09
100,Hotel rooms not well-insulated against noise.,"The staff were friendly and competent. We enjoyed our stay, save for the sound-insulation. The rooms were good, although the staircases were a bit confusing. We liked the location - especially the park. We really haven’t much else to add to this review.",3,2018,10,09
100,"Great location, not as luxury as expected","We stayed in Hotel Arena as we attended a wedding there. The service and the room were a bit disappointing. The room was spacious and had great potential, but the details (little amenities, bad renovation details) did not do it justice. It did not live up to the luxury we expected. Staff is friendly, but you can notice it's their student job. The service level is not very high. Breakfast makes up for it all. Breakfast is one of the reasons I would recommend Hotel Arena. The wedding however was amazing and we were blown away by the wedding location, the food and the whole organisation around it. Therefore I don't recommend Hotel Arena as a hotel (there are much better options for that price in Amsterdam), but I definitely recommend Hotel Arena as a wedding location.",3,2018,10,08
100,nice place to stay,"Hotel Arena is a very charming hotel situated in the beatiful Ooostpark. The Atmospere is fantastic. Our room (King Village) was OK, clean and silent. The beds, bedcovers and pillows are very nice. There is a tram stop only few minutes from the hotel . The bar and restaurant are fantastic, the stuff perfekt and kindly. We enjoyed our stay .",5,2018,10,06
100,Quality at a reasonable price,First time stopping in Amsterdam. This hotel stood out from alot of others due to being a 4 star. Location is great with a metro and tram only a 10 minute walk away. You can be in the centre of the city in minutes. For us the food was quite expensive but if your happy paying that bit more for quality dinning this is the place for you. The beds are amazing the best night sleep I've had in a long time and just what's needed if like us you plan to walk round all day site seeing. ,5,2018,10,05
100,Outstanding,It was not my first time to Amsterdam but staying at Hotel Arena this time was exceptional. It is in the middle of the park where you can have great time walking and jogging around. Beautiful lake. Breakfast overlooking a great view.Very clean rooms and it is very cool because its 2 level so i felt that i have privacy because the bedroom was upstairs. Friendly and helpful staff.Great variety of food over breakfast with good quality as well. I didnt face any issues during check-in and check-out so i had a perfect experience and im definitely staying at Arena Hotel next time i go to Amsterdam.Worth every single penny!,5,2018,10,05
100,Amazing!! Will definitely be returning,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights, the service by all staff was excellent and they were all really friendly. The hotel itself was beautiful and in a great location - the perfect distance away from the busy centre. ",5,2018,10,05
100,Nice hotel and perfect location,Nice hotel with perfect location. Courtyard rooms were fabulous clean and in good size. Breakfast was very good however service for breakfast terrible. Nobody cleaned up table and it took a long time to fill up buffet when empty. We always had to speak to service to get things done . Overall quality of breakfast very good ( when available) ,4,2018,10,04
100,Highly recommended,The hotel is located in a seemingly very quiet area of Amsterdam and in a lovely setting backing onto the park. Service and the hotel itself were both great and the bar/restaurant was a great place for a few drinks and to relax after a day of walking around the city. ,5,2018,10,04
100,Enjoyable Stay for Wedding,"We recently spent 4 nights at the Arena for our son's wedding. We had 4 rooms of varying size for our group. All the rooms were very nice. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a variety of fruits, breads, cold cuts, cheeses, hot dishes and juices.
 We also enjoyed a few dinners in the restaurant and they were all good. It's a little further out from the center but there was easy access with the metro, taxis and uber.No problem with walking to the sites either.
The front desk was responsive to any questions.The only category that was lacking was housekeeping. They had trouble getting the number of towels and additional toiletries correct. Just a small hiccup there. 
Just a warning - the showers are open in the bathrooms so water goes everywhere and the floor gets slippery. A suggestion would be to have a non slip bathmat in the bathroom.
Very nice setting in a park.",4,2018,10,03
100,A lovely stay in gorgeous Amsterdam,Beautiful hotel in a gorgeous location. Room was compact but lovely. Only thing being the mattress topper made it hard to get up or sit down on as it was so soft. Maybe two thinner pillows than one big fat one. Other than that a lovely stay,5,2018,10,03
100,A very glamorous hotel,"I only stayed one night in this hotel, but my experience with this hotel was very good. The room was very clean, so much space, well decorated. The breakfast was also very good, with a lot of things to choose, with quality and diversity.

The localization of this hotel is in the east of city but you can access the center of the city  easily.  Also, is perfect to access some points of interest of Amsterdam.

A very good choice.",4,2018,10,03
100,"Nice location, however poor service and low quality","Nice hotel location with nice common area - has a lot of potential however rooms and service are bad. Service was really bad - no wifi working in room and front desk would not fix or offer alternative solution. Arrived early and was promised first room once someone checked out. I saw multiple parties check out however I was not offered a room until six hours later. I even offered to pay an extra night and take any level of room. Housekeeping was working, yet I could not get a room. Dirty restaurant, damaged walls in room, small bathroom with leaking shower. ",2,2018,10,03
100,"Great stay, a few minor points","This hotel is beautiful firstly, set be a lovely park and recently converted. I stayed with a group of girls (6 of us in 3 rooms.) The staff at reception weren't too welcoming compared to other hotels I have stayed at, we could check in at 3 as the website states but couldn't do so any earlier. They have large lockers for you to store your luggage if you're early. We didn't really get clear instructions as to where the lifts were so got a little lost!

We got a duplex room which was lovely, although stairs are not for young children or the elderly!!! (Or if you've had a few drinks...) very steep! Bed was huge, very comfortable. Room was spotless we even had a complementary smart phone we could use on our travels! My main issue was that there is no plug in the bathroom or by the full length mirror so for things like straighteners/ tongs you had to do this without a mirror (So maybe ask for an extension lead or bring one with if you need to use them.)

The hotel is easy to find for taxis/ ubers and theres a tram stop a few min walk away, the location is nice and quiet but is still a bit far out (20 min taxi into the red light dist or 15 mins to dam square.) I would definitely stay here again though.",5,2018,10,01
100,Great hotel in a nice location ,"We stayed for 2 nights at Hotel Arena and really enjoyed it. We arrived late evening and entered the hotel through the park. The hotel looked stunning at night and was a great first impression.

On check in we were given a complimentary upgrade to a studio which was lovely, the bathroom was huge with a free standing bath and lovely shower.

We also discovered that our room had a smartphone that could be used for free during your stay including all data and international calls!! This is a great idea and we were able to use this to navigate around the city during our stay. It also provided links to reduced rate tickets to various attractions in the city.

We didn’t eat in the restaurant but did have some drinks. The atmosphere was really nice and the staff were all very helpful.

The hotel feels special and far better than corporate alternatives in the city centre.

We hired bikes and found that the centre was only a 10 min ride in or a €7 Uber ride.

If you want something slightly different in lovely surroundings I would definitely recommend this hotel.

100,"Poor service, stolen money","Hotel did not meet the 4 star rating it gave, no toiletries,  no mini bar, no water, inconvenient location. I was advised I had to put on a deposit of €50 per night which should have been €200 euro total for 4 nights, instead I was charged €350 which was $588 AUD. This was for “incidentals”, quite excessive when there isn’t even a mini bar. Then I wake up on my birthday to find the hotel has charged me another €150 which was $247 AUD. I enquire with reception and was met with unapologetic staff and offered no compensation for them taking unauthorised funds or the inconvenience and instead told I will get my money back in a month and they don’t know why extra money came out... must be ‘system error.’ We also tried to book the airport shuttle bus and were given the biggest run around reception advised to see concierge, concierge was rude and abrupt and told us she doesn’t know what we are talking about she doesn’t do that and to see reception, return to reception they say they don’t know what she is talking about then book it anyway so they could do it all along but couldn’t be bothered. I’ve never had such an awful hotel experience. Hostels treat you with better respect. Also had plumbing issues, terrible pillows and bed but due to previous dealings with reception I did not wish to deal with them any further. I couldn’t get out of there quick enough. Explained my upset to the receptionist on check out and asked for a receipt of my deposit and stay was abruptly told no and was again met with an I don’t care attitude. Left me leaving Amsterdam with a bad taste in my mouth and very upset that I was robbed on my birthday and have to wait until I return to Australia to get my deposit and the money they unlawfully took from my account and $850AUD less money to spend on my holiday. :( ",1,2018,09,30
100,Nicely designed hotel,"The hotel used to be a former orphanage and they have maintained many of the original features. My room was large and comfortable with arched beams, the bathroom was huge and very good with stand alone bath and separate walk in shower. Food in the Park restaurant was excellent with very good service. i had an excellent steak dinner with a couple of dutch beers - Nice!
The hotel is located next to a park and only 2 mins walk to the tram line for access to the city centre.
We will definitely visit again when in Amsterdam.",5,2018,09,28
100,Chic Hotel by the Park,Excellent location. this hotel is a former orphanage and has some really quirky design features. My room was large and comfortable with a huge bathroom. Dinner in the Park restaurant was outstanding with excellent service. The hotel is a quick tram ride from the City centre and i will definitely stay here again when visiting the city,5,2018,09,28
100,Great space,"The Hotel is well located, surronded by a beaituful park. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious and confortable and they have a restaurat with delicous food in a very relaxing enviroment.",4,2018,09,25
100,Nice stay,Nice stay for the second time in a row. Good environment to discover the city: nice room with a very good bed and shower. Reception service was good and helpfull. Parking under the building is very nice. ,4,2018,09,24
100,Rooms did not match up to the pictures advertised!,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel however the room was by no standard 4 stars. We were supposed to be staying in a village king but I'm not entirely convinced that is what it was. There was no headboard on the bed, the room was small and in need of some tlc. The pictures online show a bath in the bathroom but we didn't have one. Apart from the room the rest was lovely. The food was delicious and the downstairs of the hotel beautiful!",3,2018,09,24
100,Stunning hotel,Visited overnight when seeing friends in Amsterdam. Shame we spent so little time here - the hotel is quirky and in such a lovely setting. Our room was large with double height ceilings. Would love to visit again in the Summer,5,2018,09,23
100,Don’t order more water for your tea,"I asked for more water for my tea and I was charged for another tea, no extra bag of tea was provider, ended up having a 8.60 tea. Ouch!
Hotel is nice but I would eat outside, they are very fixed on their menu, all I wanted was 2 pieces of toast and tea. Toast wasn’t an option on the menu so I had to order a omelet that came with toast.",1,2018,09,23
100,Lovely stay outside the center,"This was a serene and lovely place to stay, well appointed, spa-like, interesting art and decor, and right on Oosterpark. It was not, however, in a neighborhood in the middle of a lot of restaurants or bars or cafes, so for an extended stay, get used to walking or biking to get to anywhere else to eat or drink. ",4,2018,09,20
100,Good choice in Amsterdam,"I have stayed a few times during the last 25 years at Hotel Arena and could follow the change from a former backpacker place to a more upscale Hotel. The location at the park is just nice and perfectly situated. Not too central but still near to the old town. The Hotel is maintained in good condition which is not easy considering the historic parts of the building. The management has invested heavily in a new restaurant, parking garage, terrace towards the park, conference rooms. This investment is probably the reason why the rates have doubled during the last 10 years.  ",4,2018,09,20
100,Exceeded our expectations,"Brilliant hotel. We came not expecting anything special but we were pleasantly surprised.  The hotel was a bit outside of the centre but very close to local transport which made it easy to get to.  Clean, modern and we had a free upgrade! The upgraded room was superb. Thanks to the hotel and all the staff! We would stay here again and recommend it highly. ",5,2018,09,20
100,good,"everything was good. Building is unbelliveble. Price of breakfast is to high. There is bar bookovsky not so far from hotel with half price and very nice breacfast. tram stop is nearby, but only for one tram, so you need to have a few walk or make a tram changing.",4,2018,09,18
100,Great place ,"The hotel is really nice, the staff is always with a great actitud to help. It’s close to Amsterdam downtown......the room was very clean and very big!! If you are looking for a nice place to stay in Amsterdam just book!!",5,2018,09,17
100,Good,"Location is the best.  It is in the East park, and we can use a lot of line of tram.  But, very quiet.The ceiling of room is very high.Breakfast is gorgeous with many foods and drinks, but a little bit high cost.",5,2018,09,17
100,Lovely Hotel,"A modern hotel located in beautiful grounds, although its a slight walk out of the center of Amsterdam it is definitely worth the stay as although its a little walk it is located right by Amsterdam zoo so there are locations to visit close by the hotel. There is a great bar with in the hotel with open fires which are great when visiting around winter time as Amsterdam can get hella cold. With the hotel not being central it also means the pricing is great! Rooms are clean with a lovely large bathroom (the bathroom is almost like a cube placed in the corner of the room with slightly see through black glass so if you're travelling with someone who you maybe want total privacy from I would keep this is mind).",5,2018,09,14
100,Lovely hotel with great character but missing a few key ingredients to make a great stay,I stayed in one of the hotel’s new rooms. The comfort of the bed was average but ventilation/cooling in the room was bad and I had a bad night’s sleep. There was a small vertical window which doesn’t provide much ventilation - the air conditioning unit is located downstairs and is insufficient to cool the room upstairs - the air in room felt very stale and hot upstairs and I found it difficult to go to sleep. ,3,2018,09,13
100,Arena,"super nice hotel in a super nice setting. Always good to go back and enjoy the nice restaurant with the beautiful parc. Realy close to anything, and easy access to the highway. Breakfast is super well organised, and super relaxing ",5,2018,09,12
100,Good little find,"First time in Amsterdam, and i would definately stay in this hotel again. Good location, if you dont mind walking. We walked everywhere and loved it, as theres loads to see. Theres a lovely park right outside the hotel, and the hotel bar is a lovely relaxed place to spend an evening. Staff at reception, and in bar are all really friendly and helpful. We had a duplex room, which was small, but the living room upstairs was a good space to have. Room was clean, shower is brilliant, but the negatives i have were that the rooms arent really female friendly. There were no plug sockets near mirrors, and absolutely no storage space (i ended up using the safe to put my underwear in!). There wasnt even a bedside table. These bits didnt ruin my stay, but worth thinking about if you're stopping for longer than a couple of nights",4,2018,09,11
100,Labor Day Week End,"We stayed 4 nights.  Overall disappointing.  The room was very dirty (hair in bed, floor, and bathroom, food and beverage spills on bedside tables, no mattress cover, mold in fridge etc...).  The service at cafe/restaurant was bad (rude to completely absent staff).  
Once the management was informed the room was more or less properly cleaned and they comped our food at the restaurant. Breakfast buffet is great.
Clearly the owners or managers do not stay or visit the rooms or eat at the restaurant or have very low standards.  
I have been coming to Amsterdam for over 20 years and have never experienced this.  On the positive side the location is wonderful and the place is comfortable.  
Unfortunately I will not stay there again.",3,2018,09,10
100,Weekend stay,"all in all it was a nice stay, our room wasn´t clean. The location is really nice but it is a 20 min. walk to the city center. The service was good and the stuff friendly. for families it is the perfect hotel ",3,2018,09,10
100,"Amazing room, couldn't ask for anything more","Stayed here for 3 nights two month ago and did not have one fault about the place. We went to drop our bags off at 2pm which was 1 hour before we could check in. The lad in the office at reception said he could check us in as there was a room available which was excellent. Room had two floors and a huge shower room, was definitely something different!
Staff were very friendly and the location is a short walk to city centre, but in a quite bit of Amsterdam which was excellent.

We will 100% be returning Christmas time!

10/10",5,2018,09,08
100,Brilliant short break - highly recommend,"We stayed in the Hotel Arena on a short break to Amsterdam to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were very impressed with the hotel.  The service was good, there was plenty of information about Amsterdam and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was small but very comfortable. The only slightly strange thing was that the toilet and the shower were behind smoked glass, which was nice, but meant you could see into the shower and toilet from the room - not so much a problem for a couple, but could have been a bit embarrassing.The stand out feature of the hotel though was it's location - it overlooks the Oosterpark which was lovely. The best view of any hotel we've stayed in and we'd have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2018,09,08
100,"Amazing staff, Amazing Location","My family and I had 3 rooms at the Hotel Arena and could not have been happier with the rooms, the location and the staff.  Would recommend this to EVERYONE :) Our rooms were 2 levels and the stairs were a bit steep but the bathrooms, beds, amenities were all awesome.  Being right in the park was great with kids b/c there are 2 playgrounds and is a great running/walking spot for early mornings.  We loved it!",5,2018,09,07
100,"Good location, poor finish","Amsterdam East is definitely a nice neighbourhood, somewhat away from the  major tourist areas but still within walking distance from the center of Amsterdam.   The hotel itself is attractive and somewhat interesting but comfort was below average.",2,2018,09,07
100,Superb! My fav in Ams,"The park, the terrace, the bar...best background to an amazing hotel! Rooms are super clean, quite and got all those little details that a modern hotel should have! My new fav place in Ams so far! Hands up! ",5,2018,09,06
100,Super chic space with outstanding service.,"The Hotel Arena was an incredibly chic space and wonderful use of a historical building. We enjoyed our stay immensely and the amenities made it easy for us to relax after a long trip without having to venture too far. Additionally it's situated on a beautiful park near many restaurants, so we we able to see a beautiful side of Amsterdam without a struggle. We will definitely be back on our trips to Amsterdam.",5,2018,09,05
100,Charming hotel in charming location. Dramatic deco!,Charming hotel in charming location. Dramatic deco! The room was big and fitted a king size bed. bathroom was huge too with a nice bathtub with nice views. Front desk was helpful when we requested am last minute additional bed just for one night for our daughter. Thanks!,4,2018,09,05
100,Beautiful hotel!,"Such a beautiful hotel in a beautiful park - the hotel itself is stunning and the staff are attentive and smiley! We had a suite and it was beautiful, clean and felt very luxurious! Only thing I would say is that it would be good for breakfast to be included in the price, especially booking a suite. For this reason we did not have breakfast. Highly recommended overall!",5,2018,09,05
100,Our daughters wedding,this was a great experience of our family and friends the staff from top to bottom was great nothing that was needed not handled. Always friendly and willing to help with all of our needs. We would not hesitate to stay there again ,5,2018,09,04

100,Immersed in a beautiful park,"A quiet place in a public park, well connected to the city center, friendly staff, confortable enviroment, we have stayed only three nights but everything went well. Excellent value for money, I definitely recommend it",5,2018,09,03
100,Great stays at Hotel Arena,"Third time I have stayed at this hotel for one night business stays. A lot of charm to this converted catholic girl's orphanage, great rooms and breakfast. Too bad they do not have a gym, not that they lack space. Located on the border of a huge park, goves an additional calmness.",4,2018,09,03
100,Bye money,"We had a great stay at hotel arena two months ago. 

When we arrived we were told that they needed a 100 euro hold on our visa card, which is normal so we agreed. When we left we were told that the money would be back in our account within 5 business days. 

2 months later we still are down 100 euro. We have contacted the property numerous times and now they have just stopped replying. They tried to say it was an issue with our bank but that is not the case. They have not made any effort to get the money back to us and have told us it is pretty much our problem to sort out with our bank even though our bank has no idea what the issue is. 

This has been really disappointing as we have now been really overcharged for our stay and the hotel has made no effort to actually refund the money. I would advise asking for this refund in cash before you leave.",1,2018,09,02
100,Brilliant stylish hotel,Lovely room and great servuce feon the people worling there and brilliant facilities. Perfect location and bed very comfy! Lovely view overlooking the park from the bar too. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2018,09,01
100,Beautiful hotel in amazing location,"Beautiful unique hotel on the edge of a park. Facilities were fantastic, bar was lovely, great ambience, the fire was welcoming. All staff were so friendly and helpful, can not recommend enough. Only nice touch would have been somewhere in the large shower to put toiletries on (a small shelf) rather than the floor. ",5,2018,08,30
100,the upgrades to this hotel is amzing!,"Had a blast staying here! My wife and I felt like a local because we were closer to the neighborhood than centraal station. We will be back in March of 2019 hopefully ew will be staying there again. I like the rooms, they were just the right size for us since we didn't stay long in our rooms. It's the perfect location if you want to feel like a local.",5,2018,08,27
100,Wonderful,"I’ve got a beautiful experience in this hotel, the front office was very cordial and helpful. The f&b staff was very good, there was a very good waiter, I don’t remember the name but he has curly hair, he was very funny and he likes doing his job! Fantastic experience!!",5,2018,08,25
100,Very comfortable boutique hotel,"For a night's stay in the city, this was great choice.  It has a laid back, very comfortable  feel about it.  The staff are good and attentive, the beer selection is disapointing, missing out on flavour.  Food is good and flavoursome, although the hot choices at breakfast could have been warmer.We stayed in a duplex room and it would have been better to have a mirror at the mezzanine level.",5,2018,08,23
100,Pleasant anniversary,"First of all, I'd like to thank the everyone at Hotel Arena for making our fifth wedding anniversary a very lovely experience! If we ever return to Amsterdam, I expect we'll stay there again. 

Good: 

- friendly, professional and extremely helpful staff
- good location, reasonably accessible. 
- absolutely gorgeous 
- pretty surroundings with a park that's great for short strolls
- uncommon room-layouts & designs - luxurious, modern. Very clean. 
- rooms are well-furnished, with comfortable bed, a real clothes-iron, good air-conditioning unit, nice reading area, excellent lighting, electric safe, fridge/mini-bar.
- fair restaurant in a nice well-lit and spacious venue with pleasant outdoor seating area as well
- Very nice to be welcomed with rose-petals strewn over the room and on the bed, as well as w/ a tasty complimentary bottle of prosecco :)

Room for improvement:
- the room features a staircase up to a loft area. The stairs on this staircase are too shallow, making the climb a nervous one even for people with regular-sized feet. 
- The clothes-iron was old and extremely leaky. 
- shower-doors should be looked at--extremely easy to flood the bathroom. 
- the pillows that were originally in the room were not good. They were replaced with better pillows, but still not as good as in most other hotels in this price category. 

Tips: 

- Treat yourself to an upgrade if you receive an offer. We went for the Park King suite but I think the Village King may have been better, and I believe it's cheaper. The Park King suites are supposed to have a view over the park but in our case had a less fancy view over the back of the hotel restaurant. 

- Don't bother with breakfast. 

- Take an Uber to/from the airport; it's affordable and takes 20 minutes.",4,2018,08,22
100,Different from typical,"A cute hotel with the bed in a loft overlooking the living area. You have to use a narrow spiral staircase with no railing to go up to it, so elderly or clumsy people may want to specifically request a room without a loft. The bathroom on the first floor can be seen into, especially at night, as the walls are a dark glass. Choose your roommates wisely!",4,2018,08,21
100,Hotel Arena Oosterpark,"Having stayed in Amsterdam, countless times across a wide range of hotels and districts - Hotel Arena does stand out as the best for us.  The front entrance is impressive and faces Oosterpark directly, feeling almost as if the park is part of the hotel grounds.  It is a lovely park for a stroll or to sit and relax in the day or evening.  It is well lit by the hotel side, during the night and feels safe.  The area itself feels relaxed, being outside the hustle and bustle of the 'tourist center'  yet there are trams, in every direction; on your doorstep.  The 14 line is a short walk away and runs past Artis, Rembrandtplein and to central station, frequently and quickly.  It is perfectly walk-able from Central Station also, although we did make a couple of Gin pit stops on the way!   Bar Barkowski is also close by, which is open late and has a nice bohemian atmosphere - true to the name - and is popular with the locals.  A little stroll west takes you to a good sized Albert Heijn supermarket and numerous shops and cafes, if you spot the little ice cream parlour on the corner, try their milkshakes they are special!  Keep heading west and you will hit De Pijp which is another great area (you can also hop on the tram to there, if you wish!)The room was excellent, well appointed, clean, very spacious a lovely bathroom and a very comfortable bed.   One slight upgrade would be some USB charging points, as they are universal it would be a welcome addition I think for many travelers.   The wifi connection was strong and a very reasonable speed for a hotel and easy to access.  Inside the hotel is equally impressive, it has kept many features of the original building - the staircase really caught our eye and you can't help but have a smile on your face as you walk to your room, it just feels tranquil to be there.  That we are 'home' feeling occurs way before you get to your room and we felt welcome there from the minute we arrived at the hotel.  A phenomenon that was as much to do the with excellent service received by staff: the check-in process was seamless, welcoming and we felt like valued guests throughout our stay.  It felt like a place where the staff were happy to be there as well as the guests - that's a rare quality and we appreciated it.Thank you Hotel Arena, we are fairly frequent visitors to Amsterdam and yet staying there made it feel like it was something new for us.   I am certain we will be back in the future",5,2018,08,21

100,A week in Amsterdam,This quiet hotel is a good location for tourists visiting Amsterdam. All points of interest can be reached in a short time with public transport. The Ooster park in the direct neighbourhood is an additionla plus. Very good breakfast,4,2018,08,19

Some credit card confusion when checking in,  our fault because we didn't have the card we booked with.. Generally central with respect to the museums and the night life, 30mins walk or a short tram ride to everywhere ",4,2018,08,14
100,Great location and friendly staff.,"My wife and I have just spent five nights in this hotel. It is quirky, clean and relatively well priced for this expensive city. We did not eat here so we cannot comment on the food, however we did have some drinks in the well designed and bright, modern bar area. We have been in Amsterdam now for our fourth visit in the past two years and have never stayed out here in the east side of the city. It is nice and the adjoining park is lovely although seeming frequented by a few unusual characters during the day (poor souls perhaps homeless and far away from home) ..... It was however nice to walk through and have a picnic with the missus. Some time down the long and rigorous road of life, we will return !

100,Lovely hotel in a great location ,"I loved our stay here lovely scenic surroundings in a central location. Less than 10 minutes from both metro and the tram which took less than 10 minutes into central station or Leiden square. The staff were impeccable extremely polite and willing to help.

If I could change anything it would be the cleanliness there’s quite a bit of remaining dust and the windows weren’t clean plus I would have had better lighting in the room a few bulbs were gone that effected the use of mirrors. 

Overall great stay and would definitely return.",4,2018,08,10
100,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in quiet park,"We hit the jackpot with deal on expedia when choosing this hotel for our 5 days in Amsterdam. Our room was loft with a floor to ceiling window. I believe the building is a coverted monastery or something of that nature.  It is mysterious, charming and grandiose all at once. We were a 5 minute walk from the tram and within 3 stops of the Jewish Quarter and 5 stops of all the main tourist areas and sites. Maybe 7 minutes on the tram? The location of the hotel is within a stunning and quiet Park that also houses the Troopen Museum. The staff were professional,  the dining was top notch, and room was stunning.",5,2018,08,09

very dissapointed, very expensive and very average, we should have paid max 150 euros, not 300 !!!! wit 300 euros it should be spotless and absolutely perfect. ",3,2018,08,09

100,An excellent hotel to stay in,"What a nice hotel. The hotel is adjacent to a park-Oosterpark, we enjoyed the walk there. There was separate play ground for the kids  in the park. Hotel Staff were very helpful. And the access to hotel is also have couple of security level. The restaurant area is wonderful, food are good but they can enrich the menu with more options. Convenient place for general transport. The hotel has its won parking area and also parking for bicycles. 

Our room was at a quite end. We loved the interior. Bed was super comfy. Bathroom had regular amenities. Cable TV was there but didnt get much time to explore. Will stay again if i had a chance.",5,2018,08,07
100,Fascinating hotel that used to be an orphanage.,The staff at check-in were very friendly and helpful and any requests we've made have been attended to immediately. It's quiet here and backs on to Oosterpark which is wonderful with ponds and walking paths. The restaurant is great and serves a small but good menu and the buffet breakfast is very good.,4,2018,08,06
100,Arena Hotel,"Interesting hotel but some issues....TV didn't work, no plug in basin,, couldn't open door to courtyard. I thought it was expensive to pay EU30 per night for our car to park in the garage when there is already quite a premium on the room.",3,2018,08,06
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam,"We LOVED our stay here. The staff were so friendly and inviting. We even got a free upgrade to a more expensive room. 
This was our favourite place we stayed whilst travelling through Europe. Would highly recommend",5,2018,08,06
100,Park infront of the Hotel is the beauty,"Good rooms. Value is unbeatable. Few problems on the front desk and restaurant, but overall a good place to stay for a few days. Parking cost you 30 Euro per day. Rooms are OK  but no wow. Our room had a bad smell from sink. ",4,2018,08,05
100,Beautiful hotel highly recomend,"All staff were freindly and helpfull . The hotel is set in beautiful surroundings. Within easy reach of the city center whether walking or taking public transport of which there is pleanty.. Our room was well equiped with the bedroom on a mezzanine level,(the stairs for this do take getting used to ) there was a small fridge in the room with tea and coffee facilities , two televisions one on each level of the room. A Small sofa  as well as desk and chair area .the room was finished of with a bathroom area comprising of a handbasin walking shower and toilet .which at the end of a days sight seeing was very welcome. Only issue we had with the bathroom area was due to the use of smoked glass there was a lack of toilet privacy if the lights were on ! (So make sure you are comfortable with intermacy )
   When it comes to breakfast they realy know how to spoil you. You will want for nothing at breakfast so well worth including it on your booking..
The park restraunt.( Part of the hotel) is a wonderfull place to sit and relax with veiws right accross the park.
If you want a bit of everyday Amsterdam and not just the city center tourist area .a short walk through the park takes you out on to streets full of local markets. 
Ten minutes walk from the hotel takes you to the Artis zoo. The most beautiful zoo I have ever been to and one well worth a visit.
The Arena hotel realy does offer a superb location in beautiful settings. ",5,2018,08,04
100,Interesting building,"Backs on to a fabulous park, nice setting and interesting building. A man at the service desk told us it was once an old orphanage, some of the dark corridors looked a bit creepy because of this! Room was ok. ",4,2018,08,04
100,Mosquitos,"I am currently staying in Hotel Arena and so far my experience has been nothing less  than horrible. While my check-in and room was super nice (incl. complementary wine as my wife and I are here on our vacation), our room was majorly infested with mosquitos! We complained and they said they treated the room while we were out. We came back and slept, only to wake up to find mosquito bites all over! Wouldn’t expect that in a hotel where I’m paying almost €200/night. They have basic sanitation issue.. also, found the housekeeping to leave behind some cleaning supplies. ",2,2018,08,03
100,Wonderful,"Stayed here on the way back to the UK from Maastricht, only spent a night but wish we’d had longer.  Everything about the hotel is great, there’s secure parking, the rooms are great, the food marvellous, and the staff are wonderfully polite professional and helpful in every way.  We are already planning to stay there again but longer next time.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,03
100,Neat place!,"Really lovely hotel in old orphanage, right in the middle of a big park. Staff were super friendly and helpful, neighborhood was nice, and it was easy to get around on the metro. Breakfast was excellent.",4,2018,08,02
100,A Great Weekend Stay,"Clean hotel, helpful efficient staff, good breakfast, great location close to the city but at a very competitive rate. We would definitely stay here again. The park setting is something else to explore next time! ",5,2018,08,01
100,My Stay,"the stay was fantastic, the staff were very attentive to our needs, and we woke up from amazing sleeps feeling refreshed, although the quality of the television could be improved as we did decided to spend alot of nights in, as the hotel room was so lovely. but as said it could be further improved with better quality television.",4,2018,07,31
100,Amazing stay at Hotel Arena!!,We had the most amazing stay and the most incredible room. Fantastic service. Clean. Friendly. The most magical area too. Walking distance to and from the city centre. We would definitely stay here again. ,5,2018,07,31
100,City Trip Amsterdam,"Nice Hotel! Clean, comfortable, and a lot of amenities.
The hotel is situated in a park with quiet neighbourhood. The public transport system is reachable in a 3minute walk and in nearly 20mi you are in the heart of Amsterdam.",4,2018,07,30
100,"Overall, very positive experience","Stayed 3 nights here and liked it.   The setting is an old building that was once a school/boarding house etc....right near the city park it's far enough away from the 'tourist center' yet not too far.   Many of the rooms are a bit 'funky' in their setup as they have bathroom/small sitting area on main level, then a steep staircase up to the bed/sleeping area.   They are well done/tastefully appointed so it's nice, but might that 'set up' might not be for everyone.    Service was great and there's a nice restaurant in the hotel which looks out onto the park w a great deck/patio area....decent food, nice drinks.   Also held some meetings in their meeting rooms - all very nice and serviced nicely.   No gym onsite but you can pay to use a good one (SportCity) which is ~5-7 mins by bike.   Overall would recommend this hotel if the location and 'set up' work for you.",4,2018,07,30
100,Holiday,Love it would stay again. Went with the Mrs for her birthday. Loved the room very funky. Loved the park out back. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Staff were lovely very friendly couldn't do enough for us ,5,2018,07,30
100,Honeymoon!,"We were upgraded to a higher tier room with a bathtub. The location was a 7 mins walk away from Wesperplein station or you could take a one-stop tram (1, 7 & 19 if I'm not mistaken) and walk 3 mins. The entrance is in Oosterpark. Everything was perfect and the service here is tip-top. If you wanna rent a bicycle, you'd have to wake up early to head to the front desk, else you'd have to go to Black Bikes to rent one. It's more cheaper to rent bicycles from the hotel.",5,2018,07,29
100,Stylish hotel in Amsterdam,"Great hotel location in the park. Stylish and very modern on top of the origial hospital building. The staff were very helpful. Would advice you to hired bike from the hotel to get around Amsterdam quickly and safely, but plenty of trams too. ",5,2018,07,29
100,Holidays,Excellent stay. Lovely hotel and great staff. Cool building. The shower is very good. The sleep was brilliant. Easy access to the city centre and tram tickets are available at the reception and are worthwhile buying. Will definitely be back again next time in Amsterdam.,5,2018,07,27
100,Amazing hotel,"An amazing hotel for the price. Very well designed and decorated. Staff are very friendly.
Food is high quality and the overall atmosphere is welcoming and good. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Amsterdam! ",5,2018,07,27
100,Perfect staying in Amsterdam,"1. People are very nice.
2. Hotel is really nice
 - The room is very classical and makes me comfortable
 - Easy to get the tram to City
 - Facilities at the Hotel are very nice(Toilet, Restaurant.
 - The part surrounded Arena Hotel is really good and perfect for enjoying walk, seeing people etc,.)
",5,2018,07,25
100,Slightly disappointed,"Visited this hotel recently for 3 nights with friends and was a little disappointed with a few things, firstly the room we were given was really small with very steep stairs, the room wasn’t big enough for two people so we rang the reception to tell them this wasn’t suitable And were told that they would ring us back, after ten minutes we decided to go down to the reception as we couldn’t wait any longer for the phone call, and the receptionist showed us to a different match box room with the same stairs, so gave us a third room which was much bigger and without the stairs, we had a nice stay but the room needed more plugs as there wasn’t enough and wasn’t any at all near to the mirror, if your a girl you will know what I mean... also there wasn’t any milk or water in the room.. and we had to use a plug socket with an extention lead in the corridor..running under our door... oh and we had to put the kettle on the floor as there wasn’t enough plugs.. did it I tell u there wasn’t enough plugs? Please sort it hotel arena!! And give people more pillows one isn’t enough for some people.. the decor is very dark in the corridors and very untidy ripped wallpaper was very unsightly.. and the back of the hotel from outside looks dirty and uncared for.. the entrance should be open at the side at all times.. some people don’t want to walk through the park to get to it. Bed was really comfy, air con was a plus.. and any request was met by the staff..",3,2018,07,24
100,Best hotel I’ve stayed in so lovely and clean,"We arrived early but was able to check in around 1:30 instead of 3, staff were nice hotel was so clean and friendly the location was beautiful in the park and was easy to get to the centre, hotel was so lovely and had a great atmosphere and was also so safe, would definitely recommend! ",5,2018,07,24
100,Amazing and perfect,"Everything was perfect (deco, hospitality, comfort, food & drinks...), we recommend this hotel for sure ! The next time we'll visit Amsterdam, we will come back. We even had the chance to be upgraded to a beautiful suite. What a pleasure !",5,2018,07,24
100,Highly Recommend,Had an amazing time at the Hotel Arena. Located close to public transportation and all of the staff is very helpful.You can plan a lot of fun activities at the hotel concierge. Staff is helpful at all hours! ,5,2018,07,23
100,very good,really well located hotel and helpful staff! Excellent terrace and park view! room temperature was high and room facilities didn't include the personal care kit. overall experience very good. ideal for both families and couples.,4,2018,07,23
100,"Good, with beauty spots","Unfortunately, our request for a particular room was not met, although we asked several times after the booking. We were assured that everything is alright ... Personnel is unfortunately not trained on e-cars. Charging was difficult ... Otherwise a good hotel, with a good location.",3,2018,07,23
100,Loved this hotel - Definitely be back,"The fact the weather was glorious when we stayed here, was just the icing on the cake. The hotel was fabulous. Our rooms were split level, so be aware that if you struggle with steep steps ask for a more manageable option, but we loved it. The buffet breakfast was just gorgeous, and we loved sitting in the terrace looking out at the beautiful park before we began our day. Will be back!",5,2018,07,22
100,Low service. ,Broken things in room. Front desk evening manager unwilling to take food orders despite broken telephone. Remote part of town with nothing open. Super unresponsive team and no time frame to fix room. Shame for such a pretty hotel ,1,2018,07,21
100,Beautiful!,"Excellent hotel on beautiful grounds.
The staff and food was brilliant.

The room was very large and spacious, the only issue was with the shower draining.  After a few mins the while bathroom was 1cm deep in water.

Other than than minor issue, we would have no hesitation returning",5,2018,07,21
100,"Parkside stay in Amsterdam,","Loved our stay at Hotel Area. Good accommodations and easy to get to all areas of town. Either a quick walk or bike ride away. The hotel is in a quiet area which is always a major plus. 

The on site restaurant was great too. Loved the indoor / outdoor feel. Great for the summertime. ",4,2018,07,21
100,Beautiful historic building,"This hotel was beautiful. You can feel the history. The separate seating area in room was great for me as I had my toddler with me. Great location. Not touristy, lovely park. Perfect for walking to the Artis Zoo. Nice restaurant too. ",5,2018,07,19
100,Great Hotel in Amsterdam,"What a find! Great location on the beautiful Oost park. Convenient tram stops all around the park.Nicely refurbished old building. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will stay there again when we visit Amaterdam. I Highly recommend it especially if you want a nice, quiet hotel but still near the city center.",5,2018,07,18
100,First time in Amsterdam,Was a lovely area of town right on the park. Staff was friendly. Room was to hot and no way to make It cooler. Stairway to bedroom was steep so be aware. Housekeeper was very attentive to our needs during our stay.,3,2018,07,17
100,Lovely location!,"The property is beautifully situated at the edge of Oosterpark.  When you enter the hotel you do so up beautiful granite ramps and steps past their nice Park Restaurant that is complete with a full bar and comfortable inside and outside seating.

The 24-hr service was great with easy check-in and out.  The lobby is very nice with a comfortable sitting room and also free lockers if you need to stow your luggage temporarily.

The hallways on the upper floors are dark and narrow but my room had plenty of light and a great view of the hotel rooftops. My room was small but well-appointed with air conditioning and a comfy bed and a great shower.  Everything was very clean and I especially appreciated the converter in the bathroom where I could charge my 110v electric toothbrush!

I would definitely stay there again.

",5,2018,07,17
100,stay at Areana hotel,"A really nice stay in a stunning environment with great terrace, perfect gastronomic products and very friendly people. It was more than just a stay : it was an experience. The only minus point is that kitchen was overloaded on friday, since we were not really the only ones appreciating this locality. I absolutely recommend it.",5,2018,07,16
100,Boyfriend’s Birthday,"Stayed at Hotel Arena for 1 night for my boyfriend’s birthday. Booked to stay in a suite but when we got there they’d upgraded us to the next room up and had left a bottle of prosecco, balloons and chocolate in our room. Was such a lovely touch. The room was incredible (comfiest bed ever) and quiet. Hotel is set in a park and is done up lovely. The bar/restaurant at the front of the hotel was so good as well. Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,07,16
100,One of the best hotels in Amsterdam,"I've been to Amsterdam many time but never stayed in such a classy and stylish hotel and never experienced such excellent service on all levels, from front desk to cleaning personnel. The building is amazing and the design of rooms is very tasteful. Our room was very big, bed was comfortable and on general our stay was stress free. Can only recommend.

The only little issue we had is the lack of sockets in our room. There was no sockets in the bathroom so I couldn't use my hair straightener. And there were only two available sockets next to the bed which made ironing also not so comfortable as one would have to iron right next to the bed. ",5,2018,07,16
100,Awful smell,"Apart from the awful smell of drains the hotel was amazing.
Staff and rooms really nice.
Bar and breakfast was amazing.
Breakfast was buffet and had everything you could think of.
Like I say hotel was amazing but apart from the smell of the sewage in main hotel not our room I must add.",4,2018,07,14
100,Last minute trip to Amsterdam,"We stayed here back in February but have just gotten round to reviewing!

All in all, we had a wonderful stay at Hotel Arena. We arrived early before check in but were able to hold our cases in lockers so we could head into central Amsterdam and come back for the check in at 3pm. 

We had a standard duplex double room which was huge and perfect for the both of us. The bed was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom was modern and clean and basic amenities were in the room (fridge, cups, kettle, iron etc).

We didn't eat in the hotel as we only had two days in Amsterdam so were out the majority of the time but the restaurant looked lovely and the interiors are beautiful. The whole building is incredible, with a lot of its history still present. Also, its location in Oosterpark is amazing, it was freezing but we still had a lovely walk around the hotel grounds and park. 

A short journey on a tram or metro to get to Amsterdam Central Station. Perfect location if you don't want to stay completely central and lots of little places to eat and drink close by.

Overall we had a lovely stay at this hotel, I would definitely revisit if heading back to Amsterdam.",5,2018,07,12
100,Pictures looked better,"Staff unfriendly
Room smelt of stale water
Cheap finishes to hide a run-down hotel. Mould around the bath base. Curtains draped to hide tired, shabby walls. Lift felt like it could break with just two people inside. The other lift was out of service (a telling sign of my previous point). 
Nice location next to the park - but with a few harmless homeless people hanging around in the morning.",3,2018,07,11
100,Strange but nice......,I would try this hotel again. There are some rough edges that need to be polished up a bit. It could be a very good place to stay. Lack of good toiletries in room and erratic wi-fi did not impress. Bar and restaurant obviously popular and attractive but there needs to be some attention paid to the accomadtion part of the establishment. Concierge very helpful making us a reservation for a very good Italian restaurant.,4,2018,07,11
100,Strange but nice in parts.......,"This hotel has a lot going for it but also some things which pull it down a bit; for example when I pay Euros 259 for a double room and find only two shower caps (who uses shower caps these days?) and two squeezy bottles of wash/shower gel in the room then I worry - no tissues, cotton buds, bar of soap, complimentary bottles of water or little cartons of milk (only powdered creamer here). The internet service was erratic to say the least and breakfast at Euros 43 for two (which we thought would have been included) was only adequate. Service in the bar and restaurant varied from good to lackadaisical. I would visit again but would supply my own missing items!",5,2018,07,09
100,Smell from the sewer and broken windows.,"There was a smell from the sewer the entire stay and since the windows couldn't open all the way up, we were not able to ventilate the room. NOT OKAY when you pay 170 euros per night.
They were nice at the front desk and in the restaurant PARK we had a very nice glass of wine but didn't get the mixed nuts that we ordered. They weren't busy.",1,2018,07,09
100,"Good location, weird rooms","This hotel has a good location to the park and is pretty chill, but it's weird.  The elevators are old and slow (one wasn't working when we were there) and the hallways and floors are creaky to walk on.  The bathrooms have glass walls so make sure you are good friends with your roommate!  The pipes are old and our room flooded every shower.  I had a decent time, but probably won't stay here again.",3,2018,07,09
100,Great location,"We stayed one night in a standard double room. The room was comfortable and clean. The building looked like it used to be a church and refurbished to have some modern interiors. The location of the hotel was also ideal for us. It was about 5 min walk to the tram stops that bring you to the attractions in the center. We also walked to the albert cuyp market, which took us about 20 to 25 min. There is also a tennis court and park just outside the hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",5,2018,07,08
100,Quiet and beautiful,"Nice rooms but the hotel felt a little warn in the public areas, except in the bar and the dining area.  Very expensive parking.  Nice surroundings and a nice walk towards the center of the town.  The central elevator was broken so we had go for a long walk with over suitcases.  Little space for clothes.",3,2018,07,03
100,"Modern rooms, good location!","We booked 2 nights here over the weekend and it was a great stay.  The location of the hotel in Oosterpark is great and the tram (No7) is just outside and doesn't take long to get to the city centre. 

Staff were very friendly especially since we checked in quite late and we even received a room upgrade! Room was very clean, modern and slightly unusual but very nice. The hotel is nice with a good restaurant/bar at the front. The only thing I would say would be that because of how large the hotel was and with one elevator under maintenance it did take a little longer around a few corridors to get to our room (no biggie, understandable). Upon check out they have individual lockers where you can store your luggage with your own code so you know it's secure. 

Overall a great hotel, location perfect for us and will definitely be coming back!",5,2018,07,03
100,Disappointed,Good location and pleasantly situated in the park. Most staff were efficient and friendly. Rooms were clean and the food was good. However we were offered a room which hadn't been cleaned and were put in a single room with no outlook after booking 3 months in advance for a 4 night stay. We had to ask to get moved. The other front desk staff were very helpful at that stage.,3,2018,07,02
100,2 day stay in Amsterdam with children,The hotels location is amazing and beautiful. As the hotel was very busy with the beautiful weather it was hard to catch a server but when we did it was worth the wait. Food and drink good and reasonable. The room was great especially with kids as our bedroom was a mezzanine. my son thought this was cool. Great location as just outside the centre and a lot quieter at night.,4,2018,07,02
100,One of the best Hotel's in Amsterdam,"Honestly the most beautiful hotel to stay in Amsterdam. Me and my partner booked this last minute and were slightly sceptical as it was bit outside the city centre. Don't let that put you off as i am so glad we chose this hotel. So we have been to Amsterdam a few times and stayed bang in the centre and slightly outside. In my opinion, i love the centre however going over in summer as apposed to winter this time it made a massive difference not having any Green area around i.e Parks or spaces to sun bath/chill out. So staying in hotel Arena was amazing as its smack bang in the middle of the most amazing park ever. Ive never seen lush outdoors green space like that around the centre before and when the sun was shinning, bit of music, few beers and a towel sunbathing in the park was the highlight of my get-away!! Wouldn't have been able to do this in the Centre. The hotel itself was so Chic and stylish, i love a upperclass hotel for a bargain price. Lush terrace for drinks and food looking over the park. Rooms were amazing too. just go careful what room you think your booking as they call them slightly different things when booking through other websites and you might think you are getting a certain type of tool when your not so do research! The distance to the centre was no issue what so ever, literally walk outside the hotel and round the corner for maybe 5-6 minutes and there is the entrance to the metro (train station) you buy a day ticket for like £6 odd pound or a single ticket for like £3 odd and jump on the train (Like 3/4 stops about 8 mins) and your at central station. Couldn't be easier, literally do the trip once and you will realise how easy it is. Same back again to centraal then a few stops and your back. You get the perks the Centre living but with a lush retreat to get back to and chill before the night time begins! Honestly rate this hotel and will never go anywhere also again!! Thanks hotel Arena, you little Gem :)",5,2018,07,02
100,good hotel,this hotel is located in a very beautiful garden.it is in walking distance to different bus stops and is about 15 minutes to city center.the rooms are big enough but  not very comfortable bed.the room service such as cleaning is in average condition.,3,2018,07,02
100,I felt underwhelmed,"As this was a special two night break for me and my partner i booked a Park Suite (EUR 805.60) 
On arrival we were told, the lift was broken, adding a long and winding route to get to our room. Not very relaxing. The room facilities were limited, and not even a free slipper in site for my money, along with very limited clothes space. Please consider a bottle of water to help increase guests comfort on arrival. It was a unique room, however the missing basics made me feel like I overpaid massively. I felt the guest has to adhere to your rules and not feel completely at home.
",3,2018,07,01
100,Beautiful spot for a hotel.,"Nice Hotel old and new building which fits very well together.
Nice room Park King (something with bath was sold out). Almost clean. No big issues.
Good beds and enough space.
The few was not amazing (as descibed on the website) , but nice enough.",4,2018,07,01
100,"If you want to take pictures of you and your family at this hotel, be ready to pay 150 euros","We was really disappointed about this hotel front desk, not letting us to take pictures of both of us near the stairs at the lobby and asked us to leave or pay 150 euros. In the time we was staying at hotel. No wardrobe can’t be find in the room to place your wear only on top of the fridge and glasses, no or little space for the luggage, no slippers. ",1,2018,06,30
100,I keep returning to this great hotel,"Hotel Arena is located in a great park area in walking distance to the Weepserplein. The hotel is historical and beautiful, newly renovated and really great rooms. The Park restaurant serves great meals. I can recommend a stay at Hotel Arena ",5,2018,06,29
100,Poor bed access,The bed was located on an upper level accessed by a narrow spiral staircase very difficult for an older person. The bed itself once you got up the stairs was very good and restful. Meals as expected were expensive and were only average quality.,3,2018,06,28
100,Wonderful Stay at Hotel Arena,"The hotel location is easily accessible to public transportation which is well integrated, we preferred walking as everything is close as well! They have a secure parking which was a very good option for us since we drove to the hotel. The room design is marvelous! love the two story split of the room, the hotel is part and adjacent to a magnificent park! 
The staff were very helpful and prepared a room with a crib for our baby in advance, please call ahead and they will reserve the room for you with the crib.",5,2018,06,28
100,Business trip Amsterdam,"Hotel Arena is great hotel, very big and clean rooms, great breakfast 
good location
car park facilities (rather expensive)
Very friendly and king staff , check in and check out was very quick !
Good hotel price - quality",5,2018,06,26
100,Price and performence not in line,"Couldn't walk around the beds, stair to upper room.........not enough toilet paper, bed on wheels...........etc. etc. price compared with service much to high, in the Restaurant people are very friendly but bad organization",2,2018,06,25
100,holiday weekend,"
It is a very nice hotel. The staffs are very kind helpfully. The location with the park  is super. The garage in the hotel is very important for a visit in Amsterdam. After the visit of the city is it very nice to relax on the patio.",4,2018,06,24
100,"Great service, big rooms","Enjoyed our stay. Staff were brilliant, could not fault the service. This hotel is very good for the price, lovely location on the park with nice bar/restaurant. Could easily be a 5* with one or two extra touches in the rooms, sound proofing from cleaners in neighbouring rooms not great. Interesting and unusual building. All in a nice stay and would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,06,24
100,An excellent place to stay for a short break in Amsterdam,"We were really pleased we chose Hotel Arena for our 3 night city break! 
Its location overlooking Oosterpark was one of its best features and the terrace is a great place to spend an evening. It was easy to get to all other parts of the city by tram and it was a relaxing, peaceful place to return to at the end of a day’s sightseeing. 
The hotel is based in an old building and has been tastefully updated to give quite a luxurious feel. The rooms were comfortable and the main reception area was very welcoming. The bar area and terrace were very attractive and well used. Although we didn’t use the restaurant, we enjoyed the bar snacks on offer, which were reasonable value. 
Would definitely recommend Hotel Arena as an excellent out of city centre base. A most enjoyable stay that exceeded our expectations. ",5,2018,06,23
100,business stay,"Great place, nice location, good food. For both private as well as  business stays  - service is kind and relaxed, but a bit too lazy & slow - could definetely be beefed up a bit.
Have been there several time, and would come again",4,2018,06,22
100,Cleanliness is a repeated problem,The hotel park is the only good part about it. No business center. No acceptance of USD in cash. Didn’t solve my problem with the cleanliness of the room. I’ve noticed this repeated problem answered by the ceo but I guess it will be never solved. ,2,2018,06,22
100,Amazing stay at a very good hotel,"Arena hotel is situated in a lovely park and only a few minute tram ride away from the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel has a unique feel, modern decor in old building. The restaurant attached is very good but small portions. Also the room service was good! Highly recommend, we would 100% come back! ",4,2018,06,21
100,Take a walk in the Park,"For me having dinner and liking a place enough to come back is really only partly about the food and drinks. A place can have excellent food and bad service or atmosphere and I will not come back. If the food is good, and the service is good or excellent and takes an interest in you, as a customer, I will definetely come back. Park restaurant, part of Hotel Arena is just such a place.

The food and drinks are good and good value for money, the atmosphere is relaxed, the view is great, it borders one of the big Parks in Amsterdam and the service is great (they got some cute asian looking waiters :-). 

There is enough staff to go around and a small selection of different type of meals (fish, burgers, and steak).

100,"Brilliant, Clean and Professional","We went to hotel as it was recommended by some friends. We were not disappointed. As we walked thought the park (Number 9 tram from Central Station) the hotel came into view and first impressions, were, well, impressive.  Checking in was easy and the staff were ever so polite. Would stay again, next time we're there.

It's a little way out of town but 15 minutes on the team and you're back in the hustle and bustle of the city centre.",4,2018,06,20
100,"Beautiful Place, Complicated Access, Cold Staff Members","The front desk staff are extremely cold, dispassionate, and completely un-engaging in the slightest.  Which is in direct contrast with the very aesthetic hotel itself and the lovely surroundings.  Remarkably unwelcoming and frigid was the check-in person.  I don't know if this is a specifically Dutch character trait, but it does NOT sit well with me, nor is it at all necessary when speaking or engaging with arriving travellers.  By complete contrast, concierge/room/cleaning/service staff were ABSOLUTELY engaging and interactive, very nice and friendly.  And the room, split between two levels, was very nice and comfortable, with large lovely windows and aesthetically if simply decorated.",4,2018,06,20
100,Looks great on the surface but lots of problems underneath,"We stayed at Hotel Arena for our first wedding anniversary. Our first impressions were great - check in was efficient, the hotel looked amazing, it's in a great location in Oosterpark on the edge of central Amsterdam away from the rabble, and we were told we had been allocated one of the newly renovated duplex standard rooms which looked very modern and stylish.

However once we settled in and started using the facilities in our room, things started to unravel. A few problems: Our room location - we were on the ground floor by what appeared to be a loading bay - it was very noisy sometimes quite early in the morning with vans parked directly outside our room. The shower - you cant turn it on fully or you flood the bathroom meaning we had to have drizzling showers. The fridge (advertised as somewhere you can bring your own wine/snacks and keep them cool - a great feature in principle) leaked and barely cooled anything so the wine we did buy stayed slightly warm. The aircon unit didn't really cool and was set to fan and unchangeable (or if it could be changed there were no instructions of how to do it and we couldn't work it out) For a newly renovated room the fixtures and fittings also seemed a bit faulty - we had a loose plug socket on one of our walls.

The housekeeping also wasn't the best. Our bathroom wasn't fully cleaned once during our stay - towel's weren't refolded and remnants of my husbands beard hair were still on the sink ledge 2 days later. The cleaner also didn't take away empty wine glasses and left empty wine bottles outside our bedroom door for someone else to collect. 

The room layout also isn't very well planned - the idea of having a mezzanine level for our bed seemed really nice, however once we realised that the suitcase storage and desk/dressing table was upstairs but all the facilities were downstairs, it quickly became obvious that this was going to become annoying - the stairs are very steep so getting up and down isn't a quick affair, the only full length mirror doesn't have a plug socket by it so you have to stand quite far back to dry your hair, and the TV is upstairs by the bed but the lounge area is downstairs... they're all quite minor things but add up when they all happen together. The walls are also already looking quite scuffed and need touching up. 

Overall we were very disappointed with this hotel. Our stay wasn't cheap and we expect a better standard from a 4* hotel. We won't be going back.",2,2018,06,20
100,Room spilt our stay,Bar and resterant staff should take a leaf from the reception staff instead of chatting to each other and or room was not very inviting - drab. The location was prefect in a park on the side of a canal.,3,2018,06,19
100,best hotel,"Hotel Arena is a perfect location in Amsterdam, no far from the centre of the town, near by the University. The room not big but nice, good breakfast, atmosphere building, green zone in a beautifull park ",5,2018,06,19
100,Will never come back to this hotel!,The village room wasnt clean. The bed wasn’t confortable. The elevator wasnt working. The tv screen is very small and very bad quality of the image. This hotel is very overated. We will never go back to this hotel for sure. ,5,2018,06,19
100,Such a disappointment,"We stayed here because of a recommendation through the Telegraph. It all sounds so good but based on our experience it was simply awful. Given everyone we met in Amsterdam were so charming, polite and friendly it was hard to understand how Arena had managed to bring together so many rude and surly people under one roof. There is nothing positive to say other than in the end a senior manager intervened and apologised and refunded part of our costs. We were lead to believe that they were undertaking a major staff review and bringing in a new team. I do hope so because it should be able to offer a better experience. Service was terrible. Room was terrible and as someone else commented contaminated with the smell of sewage. I wish them well as they try to put things right but I shall not be going back.",1,2018,06,18

100,A strange place with just adequate food,"We attended a function in this place, and were disappointed by the quality of the food. It was not only unimaginatively prepared and presented, but also below expectations (eg a completely dry and tasteless cake for desert).
From a number of friends attending who stayed at this property we heard less than positive reports about the size, layout, and furnishings of the rooms. Even if only hearsay, I think visitors considering the hotel should be made aware of it.",3,2018,06,11
100,poor room lay out and amenities,"very interesting building but the hotel is clearly badly managed not much experience and the room layout is not good. dangerous stairs in the duplex, poor amenities, tiny tv, no Bluetooth speakers, no body lotion, no tv in the sitting area, big queue at the coffee machine at breakfast.... etc",2,2018,06,11
100,Lovely hotel in great location,"We loved being in a park given the bustle of Amsterdam.  The tram system made it easy to get anywhere we needed to and walking to downtown was not difficult also.  The hotel is grand and spacious and having a sweet bar in the hotel was great, but there were also local restaurants very near by.  Only small problems were that the bathroom wasn't very private and the fridge didn't work, but we had a great stay nonetheless.",4,2018,06,10
100,Beautiful hotel. But some rooms are not as stylish as threat of the hotel. Great location.,"The location of the hotel is great. Located in a park and close to cafés and stations of tram and metro.
The restaurant serves nice food and the staff is mostly doing a solid job.
Although the breakfast is a bit costly and when we showed up it was already quite sorted.
The room we had was not as well designed as the rest of the hotel. Staff of the hotel was very good!",4,2018,06,10
100,What a Gem,"We stayed for nights at Hotel Arena on the final leg of our six week European holiday, before the long flight back to Australia, what a gem!
The hotel is housed in an old Catholic orphanage, as a consequence the entrance from the street is less than ideal and some areas of the hotel are less than pristine. For us this just added to the charm of the place, our room was spacious, modern and spotlessly clean. The terrace bar and restaurant provide a wonderful venue for breakfast, a drink or meal.The staff were courteous and attentive.
Step out from the hotel and you are in the expansive and spectacularly beautiful Oosterpark, where you will experience the real Amsterdam. Public transport to the more central parts of the city is located a short walk away.
Hotel Arena carries our strongest possible recommendation.",5,2018,06,09
100,HOTEL ARENA AMSTERDAM,"Beautiful location, terrace at the park, restauration of old building wel done at ground floor. We slept on 2° floor: poor finishing and no acoustical insulation. So dont book there.
To expensive for this standard room.",3,2018,06,08
100,Best stay,"We could not fault this hotel at all, all staff were great and the hotel itself is amazing, very modern beautiful decor and we had a great room. Should be a 5 star hotel. Very easy to get around the city as there is a tram stop right outside the hotel and the park that the hotel is in is beautiful. Definitely would stay here again if we go back to Amsterdam ",5,2018,06,08
100,Nice accommodation but,"Very nice hotel in a very nice place. Nice accommodation, lobby, outside cafe... Devoration nice as well but the rooms looks old and damaged. Cleanliness of the bathroom was not good and contributed to give a bad impression ",3,2018,06,08
100,Summer dining,"With great company we sat for pre dinner drinks on one of the terraces hotel Arena has. Very spacious. The chardonnay was really nice and my friend’s G&T too. For dinner we had a great fish starter. Dessert was good! We enjoyed ourselves very much and good, friendly staff too. After dinner we had a nice walk in the park. Feels like abroad, being here.

100,"beautiful place in an old sanctuary building, located in a beautiful park","Young, very friendly staff, but with communication problems, we ordered breakfast, every morning we had to inform the restaurant staff about this, at least the breakfast was books twice, but the breakfast was by the way really fantastic! To resume because of the service problems and due to the fact that the rubbish was not removed twice our sat was a little bit expensive... But nevertheless the ARENA Hotel is a beautiful place to be, it is really worth a visit.",3,2018,06,07
100,Disappointment,I was so gutted about the hotel was a treat for my partners birthday and we was both let down due to the money was paid and the misleading pictures online we would not be staying here again and would not recommend the hotel ,1,2018,06,07
100,Special hotel !,"Special hotel, quiet area, close to public transportation, close to a supermarket, right next to a beautiful park, nice and helpful staff. Problematic access to the entrance of the hotel - long walk with the suitcases.",4,2018,06,05
100,Amazing stay!,"We really enjoyed our time at Hotel Arena. Here's a pro and con list of some of the experiences we had:

Pro:
- This hotel is situated in a beautiful lively and vibrant park. It feels like an oasis and wasn't uncommon to see large heron walking about and people playing in the park. It was really nice to come back to this area after a day in the city.
- Multiple trams are located right outside of the park and will bring you into the city within 10 minutes. You can purchase your ticket on the tram.
- The hotel is designed really well. From the furniture to the lobby, things are quite nicely decorated
- Front desk staff is extremely friendly. When i first arrived, i wasn't happy with the room as it didn't have the tub that the suite reserved promised. As soon as i went back downstairs i was met with ""We want to make sure you're happy, how can we help"" and i was immediately put into a beautiful room with the tub i wanted and a canal view.
- Although the hotel hosts weddings and events, we were never kept up by noise or loud guests, it was always quite quiet at night.
- Our room was spacious, beautiful bath tub, great view of the architecture of the building and canal, large comfy bed and a seating and small dining area (Village King Suite)
- Charming old architecture in the room which included original window frames and beams.
- The neighbourhood around the hotel was quite local which meant finding small restaurants or cafes and grocery stores quite easy.
- I never felt unsafe at all and at any hour of the day. There was a couple of nights where we were much later and i never felt at risk, actually i felt this was through most of the downtown core as well.

Con:
- We share a few complaints that others seemed to share as well. I would suggest removing the carpet near the reception on your way to the rooms. It's stained and i would assumed the hardwood underneath would be a lot easier to maintain. It's not the greatest first impression.
- I feel like someone needs to walk around with a white paint brush and touch up the walls, the issue with a mostly white hotel is scuffs and it's clear that walls need to be touched up in some areas.
- Cleaning. There were scuffs on my tub that i was able to rub off but remained there all week, not sure why this wasn't addressed? We also had to call down multiple times to refill our shower body wash only to be handed small containers. On the second last evening, a replacement tube was finally brought up. When we checked in, an empty wine bottle was outside of our room. Perhaps because they didn't have time to remove as we switched rooms?
- Some fit and finish issues. When turning on the shower the water went quite a bit outside of the shower, not all over as some reported but it seemed we always had very wet towels from drying the floor. The tap for the tub was very wobbly and seemed loose as it stood alone from the tub. 
- As we walked to our room the hallways were light and airy however are room was down a black hallway. Not sure why as the area our room was in was already quite darker due to lack of windows so it was a little disorienting and i would suggest keeping dark areas a little lighter for safety.
- One evening we came back around 2am to all of the doors being locked which i think is great for the safety of the guests, however it took 15 minutes for front desk staff to acknowledge us which was a bit stressful as we were locked out.

Some general tips:
- Buy a tram pass, the trams are fairly easy to navigate and it'll save your feet and taxi costs as you're a little bit outside of the city. Like i said, 10 minutes on the tram will have you in the city. You purchased your tickets in the actual tram.
- I originally had a standard room selected but upgraded it and in my opinion was worth the money. The Village King suites have better views, larger spaces and after a long day, that tub was just what i needed.
- They were great at meeting our requests. I realize a request can't always be made but if you're looking for something specific, reach out to their friendly staff.
- The room comes with a small fridge in some cases so grocery shopping can save a little bit of money. Keeping in mind the fridge is just a few grades above room temperature. 

Hopefully that helps and enjoy your stay!",4,2018,06,04
100,Excellent location nice place,"We stayed here for a couple days before our cruise.  The hotel is located in an excellent location attached to the beautiful park. If you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown stay here.

Our room was a two story.  The bed is located upstairs with the bathroom and sitting area downstairs.  There was a lathe picture window that runs from the ceiling to the floor to allow the light to come in.  Very small room compared to the US but it’s what we expected being in Europe.

You can reach the hotel by taking the train from the platform 1 in the airport to the central station.  You can than take the metro either 51, 52, or 53 which will drop you off approximately one block from the entrance...very easy.  We got a 2 day ride pass for $44 US and it was worth it as we rode the metro all over town. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.",4,2018,06,03
100,The most a hotel can feel like coming home,"The stay was awesome! The most polite service ever! Beautiful park, hotel and interiour. The room was clean, comfy and surprisingly spacious. The only sad thing was the slow drainage in the shower and we missed a coffee mashine in the room. The tea and boiler was good but the instant coffee could not satisfy after tasting the restaurants one.
Definetly visiting again!",5,2018,06,03
100,Extremely impressive look of this Arena hotel,"I was at business trip at mid of May and spent 5 nights at this hotel. I have to say that I was fascinated with the look of the hotel, because it is a facility that was a long time ago an orphanage and therefore looks from the outside and from the inside as a hospital, and in some parts even as a church. It does not compare it with any modern hotel, but I felt very well in it.

There is a beautiful park next to the hotel where you can run a few laps before breakfast. Food at the hotel is average. Breakfast is quite average, but you will not be hungry.

Stuff - ok, friendly. 

The hotel room I was in have 2 floors where the office look room was located above, and the bedroom and bathroom below.

It's worth a visit because of its appearance and because it is quite a unique model of a hotel where you will not often have a chance to be.",4,2018,06,02
100,My stay at Hotel Arena,"I really enjoyed the stay. The staff were very friendly and always available when you had a query, helping us on transport information etc. I would definitely guarantee this hotel to friends and family.",5,2018,06,01
100,Return Visitors,"We’ve stayed here a few times before when it first opened but upon returning this time it is much much improved. You now enter from the park side and the outside seating area is fabulous with views out in to the park and fountains. Staff were excellent. We had a problem with our room (the steep unsafe stairs mentioned on other reviews and poor repair of room) and we were upgraded immediately and comped a breakfast and late check out. The second room we were given was beautiful and we would definitely ask for this one again. They also helped with booking evening entertainment and tickets. Food was great. Despite previous reviews we found the breakfast lovely and if you compare it with eating out at one of our favourite breakfast places in Amsterdam, it’s slightly cheaper and again cheaper than you’d pay in a 4 star in the UK. We will definitely return on our next trip.",5,2018,05,31
100,Absolutely stunning hotel and great staff.,"The building itself is amazing and we stayed in the suite which had a lovely arch with a visible bath on show. The room every time I entered just felt unreal. 

Our room took was only 15 minutes late to be ready for check in so we were provided free drinks at the lovely bar which over looks the park. 

Staff couldn't have been nicer throughout - their coffee at the bar is great too. 

I'd imagine people deciding to stay here would be concerned of the location, it's really not an issue. The lady at reception sold us tram/metro tickets which works for 12 euro for 48 hours - you just grab a tram and you are in the centre in 10 minutes.

If I had to find a negative which is really pushing it, there was a Nespresso machine in the room with no pods offered so it just sat there unused (not going to purchase a pack of Nespresso pods and milk for 2 nights) and the instant coffee options was just 2 sachets per day which seemed a little harsh.",5,2018,05,31
100,Terrible hotel choice ,"Before anything, let me say, the desk staff were lovely, and did all they could to make my stay at Hotel Arena as easy as possible. 

 
Executive Summary - because this is so long
The desk staff and management were lovely.  The maintenance and housekeeping staff let the side down.  The owners seem to want to appear environmentally conscious, but have chosen cheap and poor maintenance at every turn.

Now, here I go.  Hotel Arena presents itself as 4-star, and well, frankly, charges for it.  I paid approximately $325 USD (€270 or $400AUD) a night.  I don’t mind this, but expect to receive value for what I pay for. 

 

Upon arrival, my room was ready, and I was sent to it.  The first room I was given was on the street at ground level facing north, with little good light.  It consisted of a two level room with a bedroom loft located above a bathroom.  Interesting!  It was small.  About 15m2 downstairs and maybe 10m2 upstairs.  However, I like small spaces, and don’t need a lot of space, so I wasn’t really concerned about this. The stairs were about as steep as you find on naval vessels, but considerably less safe. A few of the steps were quite wobbly. The first maintenance issue. I did not relish the thought of transiting these in the night had I need to. 

 

Unless you removed the small rug in front of the bathroom, and folded it away, as there was nowhere else to put it (small room), you could not open the bathroom door. Originally, this had been designed to open inward, but the hinges had slipped, the door  had slumped, and it had not been appropriately repaired.  Another maintenance issue.  So now the door opened into the very small living space.  To open this door, no-one could be sitting on the couch or share the space with another, or the door would have hit them.  So much for travelling with a spouse. 

 

The noise from the street was remarkably loud.  The double glazing in this room was not double glazing as I have ever seen it.  It was a sheet of something attached over the frame.  Unsurprisingly, I requested a room change.  And it would not have been an issue if it ended there.  However, I was told that it would be the next morning before any change would be possible as all rooms were now fully booked, despite that I had only arrived 30 minutes earlier.  Nonetheless, in a good spirit, I accepted this, and decided not to make further fuss.  First world problem really.  I went out to wander the streets of Amsterdam.

 

Upon my return, my street level windows were wide open and things were strewn around my room.  No, nothing was missing.  But that took me about 30 minutes to ascertain this.  You can imagine my first thoughts.  It appears that someone had unlocked the windows, possibly before I had been given the room, pushed them apparently closed, and left, and that the wind had blown them open.  Or maybe there was a more sinister explanation.  Who knows? I was never told.

 

Nonetheless, the very professional manager, upon hearing my concerns and that I was to be moved in the morning explained that there was a vacant room and immediately moved me to it.  I was grateful.  She also explained that this was an upgrade.  It certainly was much larger, where the previous room had been very compact (~15m2 downstairs and ~10m2 in the loft) to the point of being cramped (remember the bathroom door and the rug… you could’ve swung a cat in it, but it would have been brain injured from hitting the walls). The new room was single level, semi-circular, and about 160m2.  I got some luck there. I loved the room. Five large windows 1.5m by 4m around the half circle, facing south and getting lots of lovely sun.  Thank you who ever upgraded me.

 

I am an escapee from the 1970s.  So I feel comfortable with Hotel Arena’s retro look. But a shower above a bath, itself raised on a tiled plinth presents problems.  The shower had no protective screen, so water hits you as you luxuriate (apologies for the image there), bounces off, and splatters everywhere else, including the tiled steps leading up to the plinth (see photo).  Water and tiles.  Mmm.  What could possibly go wrong?  You guessed it.  Major slip hazard, and I lived to prove the tale.

 

So, I then decided that I would use towels to dry the hazard before my next attempt at a shower.  Another error on my behalf.   Most of the towels were needed to dry the large mess of sprayed water to render it safe to transit to and from the raised bath.  By the next evening, housekeeping had not picked these up.  They were where I left them.  Wet, on the floor.  When I asked for replacements, I was told that these were provided only once every three days “because to the environment”.  The hotel’s own guide (see photo) states “leave towels that need washing on the floor”.  I did only what the guide stated. But was told this is not how it’s done.  Although, housekeeping were asked to come and do this on this occasion for me.  Thanks!

 

Next plumbing issue.  When you turned on the water in the hand basin, water rushes from the tap to the hand basin, as it should.  But this tap had other ideas.  It came with added extra spray.  Everywhere.  But mostly on me free photo).  I’m not some wimpy entitled wuzz.  So, I tried to tighten and fix this.  But alas, no tools, just wet towels and my hand grip.  I did tighten it a bit, but learnt to use only a trickle of water.  Later, maintenance looked at this.  Thought about it. And suggested I use less pressure.  Good idea. How about no pressure at all? Certainly they were under no pressure.

 

Actually, maintenance bought the replacement towels I’d asked for. Interesting choice of staff.  He and his off-sider looked at the tap and at the bath.  They agreed that these were bad design choices. Maintenance shrugged his shoulders, and left.  Hey, I could have saved them money by doing my own shrugging.

 

Never in my considerable travels (and I’ve been to a few places) have I encountered wildlife actually in my room with me.  The little silver insects were everywhere, all over the bed including when I woke, on me. See the photo.  I think these are generally harmless creatures, much like Silverfish we have in Australia.  And they didn’t bite.  But really? 4-star. €270 a night?

 

By now, you’d think I would have left.  I nearly did.  But I liked the retro décor, even if it was a bit grubby in places free photo).  You should see the carpet in the hallway from the lobby (photo attached).  I’ve seen it before I think.  In pubs where large crowds go to see live music and drink copious amounts of beer.

 

The Television was mounted (loose use of the term) on the wall.  It is a 26” or 65cm low resolution television, located 4m from the couch or 5m from the bed.  Hey, no complaints about the space.  The mount was broken, so the screen faced the floor at a 22.5⁰ down angle.  Made viewing a little more difficult than one would like, but the distance to the bed or couch rendered reading screen prompts and subscripts almost impossible.  I suppose I could’ve manned up and moved things, but I really was not interested in watching TV. I was here for work and to see Amsterdam, not the news.

 

The couch was a small two seater that was simply not possible for anyone to recline on let alone relax on.  I can only imagine that they got a job-lot on these.  The rest of the room furniture had that cheap, not up to the grade quality about it.  But the room itself was large and the 15 foot high ceilings were fun as were the 12 foot high windows.

 

My guess is the management are trying to be green, and some of the staff (all the desk staff actually) are lovely, but that the owners are cheap, and trying to make it look like they’re environmentally oriented, when really, they are just cheap and doing their best to maximise profit.  The proof is in the lighting.  The lights were cheap retro-fitted fluro globes.  The wattage from these was something in the realm of a black hole - no light emitted.  About one quarter of the globes actually did not work (maintenance…).  Throughout the building, except the restaurant, the lighting was very dim and fluoro globes or cheap incandescent.  Had the owners been oriented toward the environment they could have fitted lower cost and more environmentally friendly LED globes.  But I suspect this was not their point.

 

There is simply no need for this to have been as expensive as it was given the abominable maintenance and ridiculous quality of fittings and design.  The maintenance was simply unforgivable.  BTW, cleaning. I’ve never had housekeeping staff insist I leave the room before they would enter and make up the bed, but they did here.  Maybe I’ve just been lucky until now.  On making up the bed, this was done on two of the five nights I was there.  I suppose they needed to save on housekeeping!

 

Last.  Renovations were going on while I was there, but in a different section of the hotel, adjacent to where I was.  Days with interesting noise, but I was out, so who cares.  Maybe it was that the room was soon to be renovated, in which case, why charge Hyatt prices.  ​",1,2018,05,30
100,Nice hotel - bad reception service,"Very nice hotel. Beautifuly done with nice decoration and style

100,Beautiful hotel in the park,"The hotel looks beautiful, quiet and elegant, just inside Oosterpark. Prices are a bit too high considering that rooms are not so cool like the outside. Buffet breakfast for 21€ is pure madness, but you can have something really good from the menu for 8/10€. They rent bikes too.

Staff are all friendly and very helpful. ",5,2018,05,28
100,not very clean,"we really liked staying in the hotel. the park is beautiful and the terrace is perfect. Unfortunately the service in the restaurant is VERY SLOW

unfortunately our room was very dirty! under the bed we had extremely a lot of dust and even a pair of glasses and also the small tables beside the bed
weren’t cleaned.

the hotel is perfectly located and very beautiful but for the price we payed
it should be a little bit cleaner…

best regards

100,Beautiful place in a beautiful location,Thanks so much to all the staff we encountered. They really work hard to make the place a success. The location by the park was lovely. We really enjoyed this oasis from the crowds and appreciated everything about our stay. We highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,05,27
100,An Island of calmness in a hot city,"We had a wonderful stay in this special hotel with helpful, friendly and young staff.
We can recommend this place at the border of a nice city park - perfect to run in it.
Located next to the museum highlights. Not for poeple they like to have party all the time;-)",4,2018,05,25
100,Pleasant stay in lovely park surroundings,We had a really nice stay in the Arena Hotel. I like the location on the edge of a lovely park. It's about a 25 minute walk to the city centre and a 15 minute walk to nearest train station.. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly. Bar had a nice vibe and plenty of outdoor seating. I would stay here again.,4,2018,05,24
100,"Good price, picturesque location.Small rooms, mediocre service.","Located in a beautiful city park, this hotel is pleasant to look at and the lobby bar and restaurant offers tasty food and drink with a nice view on the greenery.

I was disappointed with the room. My brother and I ordered a room with two beds, and found a tiny room with twin beds pushed together and hardly any room to separate them. Not realy any room to store luggage for two, and certainly not to unpack. The bathroom was uber modern, which is to say there was no shower door and the water flooded the bathroom floor until we started buidling a dyke ({it's the Netherlands after all ) with towels. 

I asked for  loaner bicycles but they were all gone so the clerk gave me a card for a rental place. I aksed her to call to be sure,  and indeed she found they didn't have any either. She then reserved us bicycles at a place which required a tram ride about 10 minutes away, except that when we got there, it didn't exist.  Pretty poor assistance from the desk.",3,2018,05,23
100,5 nights review,"The hotel is located at a very beautiful park, so the view when you get in and out, is incredible.
The Double Standard room is spacious, bright and with a very comfortable bed. 

A few things to to mention: 
The room was located just below a loading and unloading place so every morning there were loud noises. 
We stayed for five nights and they never change our towels.
The minibar does not really cool drinks, but you can get some ice in the Bar.
If you want to rent a bike, you can only do it until 11pm, not for 24hs.

Apart from that, we had a great time!",4,2018,05,23
100,Best rooms near city centre,"Nice location in the PARK!!! Good service and big rooms ^_^ Fast wifi, modern bathroom, large safebox for my laptops and others things. Like it. And wonderful croissant and coffee for breakfast. First time in Amsterdam and its nice experience, thanks! ",5,2018,05,19
100,Flooding bathroom and bad sound proof,"It’s always flooding in the bathroom when I take a shower.

I have informed the hotel about this issue, the flooding goes all the way to the living room. But no one fixed it or maybe no one could fix it. 

From the look of it, the hotel knows about this issue.

The sound proof is really bad.",2,2018,05,18
100,"Great lobby, rooms disheartening - like a tired 1980s club","I was so looking forward to Hotel Arena and was so disappointed. The location is great and the bar/cafe and lobby are great. Literally the moment you leave the reception the hotel goes downhill. 
First you walk down a long corridor with a really really stained carpet with grey blobs of something unmentionable all over it. Not a great start. How about cleaning that carpet, Hotel Arena?
Then the rooms - well, they are just soulless and disappointing and *could* be amazing. The architecture is brilliant. My mom had a huge room (160) with huge windows overlooking the canal - but it was shabby with scuffed paint on the walls, bad decoration and just no soul. My room was worse. 
I had a room on the floor above. I had to go through winding corridors that looked tired with crumby unclean carpets and strange drapes on the walls to hide bad wall coverings to get to it. I felt like I was in the hotel from the shining with anonymous long corridors that looked completely undesigned. 
When I got there my room (261) was a kind of loft room with character and beams but the decor was again - tired and soulless - the walls were really scuffed and tired, there was a dodgy white leatherette sofa with a bland cushion, there was a thing at the bottom of the bed that held the TV and a fridge that was made out of hardboard - just thrown together - with cables hanging out of the back for all to see, and a horrible little plastic bin. No eye to design detail. The bathrooms were like bachelor pads from the 1980s and the toiletries were just mass market and screwed to the walls. The toilet brush was facing up - disgusting. 
The beds were WAY too soft
The staff were pretty unfriendly too. 
I paid almost 1000 euros for two rooms for two nights and I was so looking forward to it. In the end, of the three hotels I stayed in, it was the most expensive and the most disappointing. It could be so good but just isn't. 
The only good thing was the cafe that the public use - nice staff and good food. 
The breakfast was not included (read the small print) and was over 20 euros per person - the most expensive breakfast I had in any hotel in amsterdam (I stayed in 3 hotels on this visit).",3,2018,05,16
100,Cool hotel & beautiful Oosterpark,"I stayed here for two nights with my parents for my mum’s birthday. The hotel is huge and has obviously been quite newly renovated. I was impressed with the attention to detail throughout the hotel and considering there are so many rooms to renovate, they’ve made a solid job of it. 

Check in took some time & then I was told to complete check-in later on as the systems were down. The staff were very polite about it & it wasn’t their fault. It also didn’t cause me any inconvenience except for having to wait around for an extra 15 minutes or so. 

I stayed in a standard room and was very happy with it. It was split between two floors (bed/tv located on a small gallery up some stairs) and bathroom/lounge area downstairs. Spotlessly clean & very comfortable bed. It’s a shame there was no drinking water in the room, that would be my only criticism. 

The hotel is located within Oosterpark which is a short tram/metro ride away from Dam Square. It would take about 25 minutes to walk I think. Oosterpark was lovely - great family atmosphere & perfect for an early morning run/people watch. 

I didn’t have the hotel’s breakfast but I know it was expensive. There was, however, a lot of choice. ",4,2018,05,15
100,"Fancy, nice park, cool place to be and live in","Soft place with park to walk, jogg ordo tennis in. Good kommunications. Nice breakfast & bar. Yoga in the capel, with a fantastic teather, how cool isint that? Springtime hotell. Try Foodhallen and Das Kas",5,2018,05,14
100,I will definitely be a returning customer!,You will not regret staying at the Hotel Arena!  It’s beautifully restored with contemporary design in mind.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is situated in a park where you can easily take afternoon or evening strolls. ,5,2018,05,14
100,Very good stay!,Very good accomodation in a quiet area close to the city centre. Easy access with public transport. Enjoyable location within the park. We had a very nice duplex room with all the necessary comfort. The hotel has a good bar/restaurant for an instant drink. ,4,2018,05,14
100,"Beautiful and quirky, with room for improvement","We recently stayed at the Hotel Arena for a couple of nights for a city break. I chose it as I thought the price was reasonable, I liked that the location was in a park and not right in the city centre but still a walkable / commutable distance, and the fact that it was a converted orphanage intrigued me.

I loved the rooms! We were towards the back on the ground floor and our room was split over two levels, with the bed above and the bathroom and a small seating area below. It was decorated simply but still modern in mainly black and white. There were TVs upstairs an downstairs. I loved the height of the room and the massive windows, which made it feel light and airy. The curtains block all of the light, which was important for my husband to get a good night sleep. The bed was massive, I had to do a little shuffle to get anywhere close to my husband, and it was very comfortable. There was a tapping noise in the walls during the night which could be pipes or air conditioning, but the lady at the desk said that they would look into it for us.

Luckily my husband and I are quite relaxed around each other, however the glass bathrooms could make you a little unconformatable. The bottom third is clear, so if someone is sat on the toilet you can look across and see the person on the sofa's feet and legs, and vice versa! Like I said, quirky, but this wasn't really an issue that would put me off staying here again.

When we went down to breakfast the first day we gave our room number and were told to ""please, go ahead"". This may be very British of me, but I like to be told ""Breakfast is here, coffee is here, sit anywhere you like / in this area and please help yourself."" I was a bit lost and couldn't find the coffee machine, and then overflowed the coffee machine as only small cups were available and it didn't strike me that the coffee wouldn't fit in the cups. It was a little embarrassing. I avoided the whole coffee process the next morning, although no one else that I saw had the same issue. The next morning the waiting team seemed livelier and I suspect would have pointed everything out, but they knew it was our second day so were happy to let us roam. I don't think next time I would bother with breakfast, despite the fact that the pancakes were delicious. I just never seem to eat enough to make the breakfast charge worth it.

I was really easy to walk into town, but as it was so hot while we were there we did get the tram a few times, which was really easy to navigate.",4,2018,05,13
100,Expensive breakfast.,Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was average and really noisy being by the road. Breakfast is far too expensive....20 Euro pp is too much when all you need is a cup of coffee and a croissant ! Location is average.....its a bit of a walk into the main parts of Amsterdam. The setting is good though fronting onto the park. ,3,2018,05,13
100,Amsterdam Hotel,"I work in  the tourist industry in Ireland 
I would NOT recommend your hotel
I did not encounter any front of house manager during our stay
The location was good
Staff were friendly but seemed to be untrained in guest relations
Overall level of houskeeping was very bad
Room not cleanded properly on 2 days
Breakfast was poor ,selection bad .
Buffet not maintained or replenished
Waiting Staff unprofessional",2,2018,05,12
100,Disappointing,"Very disappointed with our stay this time, room very dated ineed of remodel and over priced because of this, which is a shame as we have stayed here before  and had a much better room.
On a plus side fantastic location with the entrance in oosterpark, lovely place to relax and enjoy morning coffee fantastic scenery",3,2018,05,11
100,close to 5 star,Hotel arena was a very calm and peaceful place. historic exterior combined with modern interior design. high comfort in rooms. great location in a beatiful park. close to tram and metro stations which make it an overal great value for the price. thank you,4,2018,05,11
100,Comfortable and quiet hotel on the edge of the canal belt with lovely park outside.,"We really liked this old, charming property and the basic, but comfortable room. We were able to get a locker on the day we arrived to store our luggage while waiting for our room to be ready. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the restaurant looked very nice and overlooked the park. The hotel is a bit far from the centre of the city and you will have to take transit, but the stops are close by. ",4,2018,05,10
100,Old fashioned hotel with great location.,"Hotel Arena is an old fashioned hotel, with a great history, and nice architectures features. Great location next to a large, and nice park. Short walk to the tram, which take you to the centrum quite often.
The staff was very serviceminded and helpful. The food at the hotel is excellent, and we absolut recommend an evening with dinner from the Hotel Arena.
There are a few things that could have been better. The whole bathroom floor was getting all soking wet when taking a shower, because of halfway open showersolutions. We missed a small refrigerator, and the cleaning could have been little better.
All over, we had a great stay and experience, and we be happy to visiting the hotel again.
",4,2018,05,10
100,Absolutley loved it,"Stayed here for two days, amazing location that park and scenery are beautiful on our first day we came home and sat on the park wih a few drinks and it was full of locals all with their families having bbqs and playing games lovely to see. The room itself was lovely, quirky with an authentic Amsterdam feel to it with the spiralling stairs, I have seen people on here moaning about the stairs, but they’re on all the pictures of the rooms so you should have known what to expect when booking ? The bed was the comfiest ever and turned our 20 minute nap into a two hour one oops 
The food was lovely we only had dinner we got the burger and chips and the ricotta raviloli absolutely perfect. The location is out the way but it’s nice and if you can use your phone maps to Weesperplein it’s 3 stops and the tram number 7 is right outside the hotel which takes you to the Heineken experience 

Staff are all lovely and happy to help",5,2018,05,08
100,Lovely hotel in fantastic location,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  We were very pleased with the service, the view and amenities. The staff was very friendly and accomodating.  Our pillows were too large and the service personnel gave us two new and flatter pillows immediately.  ",5,2018,05,08
100,Lovely hotel,"Myself and 10 friends stayed here for 2 nights. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel rooms are lovely, I loved the split level aspect (although the stairs are a bit steep). 
Breakfast was great, plenty of choice including hot food, fresh breads and fresh fruit. 
The location is stunning, walking out the front door each morning to see the beautiful Ooster Park and the dancing fountains. 
Trams are a 5 minute walk or Dam Square a 15 minute walk away.
Staff very friendly and helpful.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,05,07
100,Unpleasant and very bad quality/price rate,"Very small room
Bathrom not adapted (to small - staying on the wet floor in front of the sink after a shower)
Spider's webs on walls and ceiling
Poor Service room (had to call the reception to replace of a empty shower shampoo tube)",2,2018,05,04
100,Bar area saved the horel,"Starting with the positives: 
- great variety at breakfast and lovely setting
- really enjoyed sitting by the fire with a glass of wine
- felt totally comfortable having a young child with me in communal areas as the hotel was full of kids
-4* for those bits

On the other hand, the room was inadequate. Dirty/marked walls; dusty dirty floors and bedside tables; not child friendly (random steps); had to request a change of cot twice as housekeeping had left a broken one for us and the next one was broken too. TV/couch area was cramped and not a good use of space! Was more suited to being a cupboard. Room was a 2*, even with the big shower room. Carpets at our end of the building were smelly. 

Staying at the hotel, we felt like we were close enough to the centre and nice to be out of the busy parts, but it is a long walk if you wanted it to be local.",3,2018,05,03
100,Not the best housekeeping,"My partner and I visited the hotel Arena based on a recommendation. The location in the old Kolster is magical and the hotel is well located. Unfortunately, we had to realize that the breakfast can not justify the proud price of Euro 20.00 per person. The selection of the offered food can be found in every 2-3 star hotel. In addition, we had to find our own cutlery and wipe our own table.

Really problematic was the housekeeping in our room, here the sink in the bathroom was not cleaned, no surfaces wiped and dirty dishes in the room left.",2,2018,05,02
100,"Great location, nice hotel but poor room","This is a nice hotel in a lovely location. Unfortunately the TV didn’t work and the bed was uncomfortable. Two beds had been put together, but one of them was at s different level and leaned to one side.",3,2018,05,01
100,Try to avoid it if you look for a pleasant week end,"This hotel is definitively not up to the 4-stars standard. Potential may be there, atmosphere tends to be cool and relaxing but dirt, noisy and sometimes small rooms, lack of service in the restaurant for breakfast, doesn't make the experience very pleasant. Without mentioning the price they charged.",1,2018,04,30
100,nice architecture,the hotel is beautifully located next to a great park. a renovated old church-building makes it very charming. all rooms are spacious and indivudually designed. the staff at the reception was friendly and helpful. just the price could be a bit lower,4,2018,04,29
100,Great location,"Good location. Nice staff, hotel nice but a bit old, need more maintanance, room small and dusty, pillows too big and uncomfortable. Good restaurant and bar, nice atmosphere, food average, good beer!!",3,2018,04,29
100,OK but far away from the city,You have to take the tram to the center of town for tourist attractions.  You need to take the tram to any tourist attraction.  It’s not for older people;  many units got beds upstairs through a spiral staircase.,3,2018,04,29
100,Amazingly unique stay! ,"I was lucky enough to spend 4 nights at Hotel Arena this past March and it was perfect. Amsterdam was our first stop on a 5 week Europe Trip and it started the holiday off perfectly. 

If you are looking for something unique and quirky this place is perfect. The building is incredible and is located in the middle of a park, what’s not to love about that. It’s an old building with a modern touch. The interiors are beautiful and warm. 

We stayed in a double room which to our surprise had a loft bed. It was so cool. I’m sick of boring hotel rooms and this was anything but boring. Clean and cute, loved it. 

Just one warning, the bathroom walls are tinted black but you can still see through to the loo and shower. 

The hotel restaurant is lovely and the hotel is in a great location with bus and trams close by. 

Thanks for the great stay Hotel Arena. I have already recommended you to a bunch of my friends. ",5,2018,04,28
100,Fantastic Hotel!,"This was such a great place to stay. Fantastic interior, and set in the grounds of the park. The rooms were large and spotless, the staff couldn't be more helpful, and the food was great too! The location was very near the team stop, so easy to hop on or off, but also within walking distance of the centre. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2018,04,28
100,Hotel arena Amsterdam,The arena hotel is straight next to Oostpark and very close the the centre of Amsterdam. The tram stops very close to the hotel so travel to other parts of the city is really easy to do. The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly always willing to help out whenever possible. It was my first time in Holland and i will definately be making a trip here again. ,5,2018,04,27
100,A place to recommend,"Spent my honey moon there, the hotel is very nice, loved the room and the facilities, also they had a gallery in he hotel, which was very interesting. I would definitely stay there again, loved the hotel and the park :) Didn't eat there, but had a drink with my husband and they were fantastic!  The women at the front desk were very polite and helpful, I loved the whole experience there :)",5,2018,04,26
100,"Beautiful Hotel, Terrible Service.","I and four other friends stayed here and loved it, however it has since been a month after the trip and we’re still getting hassled for ‘authorisation fee’ payments which were never agreed. 

Every day on our trip we would argue with reception because they were taking money out of our account for no reason nor warning. 

They never had an explanation as to why this kept on happening and always had to transfer it back to us & even now we’re still having invoicing problem with them. 

The hotel itself is beautiful but all of the stress is not worth it. At all. 

Save yourself some stress and stay somewhere else.",3,2018,04,26
100,A beautiful hotel in a beautiful and convenient location.,"This hotel is excellent value for money. We were given a beautifully designed, spacious room with a very big bathroom that felt like a spa. The staff were helpful and very friendly, and the hotel is situated in a beautiful park near museums and other amenities. Top class!!! :)",5,2018,04,25
100,Fantastic hotel at the right location,The hotel has a great ambience and the outer park is a delight. It has convenient access to all highlights of Amsterdam via tram. A great place for couples and family. The restaurant was great and the atmosphere was very lively.,5,2018,04,25
100,Beautiful Hotel and Surroundings,"We came to Amsterdam for a city break in April 2018 and had booked to stay at Hotel Arena.
We arrived on a sunny Saturday and were in awe of how beautiful the hotel was on arrival through the park! We arrived around 12pm and weren't able to check in till 3pm (which we already knew would be the case), so decided put our bags away in lockers behind reception (great lockers and easy to use) and have lunch at the Park Restaurant next to the hotel. Our meal and the service were brilliant and it was a nice sunny welcome to Hotel Arena! 

Once we checked in, we were given our room number (Room 62) and it was beautiful! Medium-sized room with a large bathroom (with a large corner bathtub) and the room was on 2 tiers. The room was quite dark, but was clean and nice. 

After the first night, the novelty of having a room with two tiers wore off as the stairs were incredibly steep and there's no protective hand rail on one side, so going to the toilet on the lower level in the dark could be potentially really dangerous if you fall.

Besides the staircase, the hotel and staff were perfect and we couldn't fault them. They were extremely friendly, our room was cleaned every day and the general hotel and restaurant is honestly beautiful with very well thought out décor.

There was free WiFi the entire time we were there and the location of the hotel was perfect as it was right by a tram stop and the metro station which took you into the centre of Amsterdam in less than 15 minutes. Public transport was very regular and lots to do! The entire city centre can be explored using the tram and Metro network which are easily accessible from the hotel.

We would definitely stay here again, one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in! Would definitely recommend!",4,2018,04,24
100,Room disapointing,In the initial room we got upon arrival we had a problem with noise. A generator noise coming from the joint wall.  At 2a.m. we had to complain and were moved to another room.  The 2nd room was not worth the money we paid in the 1st instance. Very unwelcoming and facing the main road. Lucky traffick was stopped due to works going on. The bed was located in a mezzanine level and the  bathroom was downstairs with steep staircase the facilities in the bathroom were not easy to use. Deep bath you had to climb to have a shower.  All in all very disappointing and not good value for money. ,2,2018,04,24
100,Fabulous hotel,Beautiful decor and location within a lovely park. Very stylish rooms just lacking a wardrobe to hang clothes and curtains a bit dirty but in all incredible hotel which I would highly recommend to stay and will book again ,5,2018,04,24
100,A comfortable hotel within a very nice park,"A very comfortable hotel within the grounds of a wonderful park.  It is also close to a metro station which makes access relatively easy. However, by foot it was quite a long walk from the city center. ",4,2018,04,24
100,2days in hotel arena,"Good breakfast but very too long to get a coffee.
A lof of noise (worker in the street ans neigbour)
lovely place, 
Beautiful volume in the room.
Room was not clean as expected, 
uncomfortable mattress.
Close to Tram and metro.",3,2018,04,23
100,Hotel Arena,"Dirty bin when we arrived (tampons and sanitary napkin)
No cold water the first night and in the morning
Braun water on the last evening
For the price I should have gone somewhere esle (no commercial gesture even after this problem)",3,2018,04,23
100,Breakfast options are awesome - bathroom needed to change!,"Comfortable room, nice look to the hotel. Bar/breakfast area super fun. Only issue really was the bathroom. Dark glass but if you have a light on in there then it may as well have been clear glass... also the door doesn't have any connection to the wall, just open glass swing door so no privacy. Fine if in a very comfortable relationship but really its just awkward...",4,2018,04,21
100,Perfect location and awesome room!,"Hotel Arena was great, there were a couple of minor issues with the room drapery and the thermostat, but the staff took care of everything right away! The view of the park was very enjoyable, and the bed was super comfortable. We will likely stay again!",5,2018,04,20
100,Hotel with a view,"Wonderful location, just off the beaten track. Somewhere relaxing to retreat to after a busy day in the city. Quiet rooms for good sleep quality. Beautiful compliment of old meets new with the renovation of this old orphanage. Highly recommend",5,2018,04,20
100,Excellent stay!,"Beautifully renovated hotel in an exceptional building. Tastefully decorated rooms, very good service. I would stay with family or for romantic get away or for business- excellent choise for every sort of a trip.",5,2018,04,19
100,"Fantastic hotel and location, but terrible sound isolation","The hotel and its facilities were perfect, loved that it was close to the park. The breakfast was amazing, and great to be able sit outside.
But...there was no sound isolation to the room. I heard everything happening outside of my room all night, even a door closing sounded like it was in my room. I am not that fuzzy with sounds, this is the first time it has ruined a good nights sleep for me. Too bad when it's such a great hotel.  ",3,2018,04,19
100,Average hotel expeience,"Overall we had an average stay. Hotel is located about 15min walk from the city center, but considering the price that's fairly reasonable... We had the hotel breakfast one of the days, and that was great. Just make sure to order in advance (saves you a couple of Euros)...
In the room, we had to climb stairs to reach the bed- unsafe if need to use restroom in middle of the night... Also the bathroom walls are made of glass, which leaves no privacy to the person using it.",3,2018,04,18
100,Truly Perfect!,"I got the Standard Room. The Staff were always to happy and helpful throughout our stay!
The room was beautiful and clean and the view from our window (Straight on to the park) was breathtaking! 
The area is so quiet ( im used to living in a noisy area) so to have it so quiet for was amazing!

I didnt try any of their food as i ate out but from what i could see the Hotel Restaurant looked beautiful with the food smelling amazing!
And its not to far from the City Centre!
Would certainly",5,2018,04,18
100,Great weekend!,"Great location! First nice weekend of the year and everyone was out in the park. The room was well appointed though the bed edges were very soft, maybe two chairs would be nice. The shower tile floor was somewhat hazardous when wet. Solved with a towel. Overall a very nice stay.",4,2018,04,17
100,Thing to improve,"We had issues with the blinds and windows of the room and bathroom. After reporting it to the front desk they fixed it partially, so we ended up having shower in a freezing bathroom for 2 mornings. It was not fun. Also the lights in the room are brighting only 1 side of the room whilst the mirror is on the other side of the room. Not fun either when you try to get dressed before going out.
I would prefer to stay in a low quality hotel in the centrum instead of paying more but not getting the value of it during my short stay.",2,2018,04,16
100,Promising but not quite,"Room 250 needs a facelift!! Room doenst look comfortable or cosy. What should be a upgrade due to overlooking, felt a downgrade. 188€/night is too much considering location (30 min on foot to Rijsmuseum), quality of the room and staff service and care. Overall only the lobby looked as in pictures!  Too bad. 

",3,2018,04,16
100,Brilliant hotel,"We stayed here for a girly holiday so a party of 4 in 2 rooms. The checkin was great, staff friendly and extremely helpful. Hotel was clean and modern and the setting in the park is stunning. Not overly sure about the mezanine style rooms initially but they were lovely and fully functional with very comfortable beds and regular towel changes. Would definately recomend and visit again
 ",4,2018,04,14
100,Mid week break,Hotel was a little poor for being a 4 star hotel. Cost of breakfast was very expensive. Not many facilities for a 4 star.  All in all we had a nice break. Lovely city.  Nice and easy to use trams to get about the city. Loads of things to see and do for all ages. Really enjoyed our stay.,3,2018,04,14
100,Fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam,"This was such a lovely surprise.  A beautiful well run slightly quirky hotel right next to the park.  The hotel team were super friendly, efficient and accommodating. The rooms were clean, comfortable  and had  character. Definitely going back ",5,2018,04,14
100,Great hotel,It may be out of the way of central Amsterdam but we loved the location and restaurant. This is a must stay hotel. It’s very chilled out has amazing feel to it. Finally a hotel with character and lots of it! ,5,2018,04,14
100,City break,Really nice hotel. Good heating and plenty of hot water . Staff very friendly and helpful. Good public transport near by. Food good but overpriced and poor selection. We didn’t eat breakfast so cannot comment on that.,4,2018,04,13
100,We´re coming back!,A really nice hotel near the center.Friendly staff and good breakfast. Unfortunately the house keeping was´nt so good like the other impressions. The park around the hotel is really nice. It´s possible to sit outside of the restaurant. ,4,2018,04,12
100,Fantastic hotel!!,"Just returned from a two night stay here! From the second we saw the hotel we were amazed, photos do not do this hotel justice! The hotel is located in a quite part of Amsterdam which is ideal when it’s only a 20 minute tram/metro away from the centre! The room we stayed in was what we expected and more, the only criticism we had was the rooms were quite warm during the night but overall a great stay! 👌 will be back!",5,2018,04,12
100,A unique hotel within a pretty patk,"A last minute reservation resulted in a nice room upgrade as my room type was not available.  The bar pato was busy on a sunny Sunday so service was a little slow but understandable.  The room was large (courtyard patio) and nicely appointed with a large glass shower.  The building is very interesting, a former hostel years ago that has been converted to a boutique hotel.",4,2018,04,10
100,Disappointing,"Very overpriced for very poor room service had to go to front desk everyday as coffee and tea wasn’t replaced, bed wasn’t made, cups not cleared and replaced, room nice enough but no element of luxury for a suite would not return  ",2,2018,04,10
100,All 16 people loved this hotel!,What a beautiful hotel right on a lovely big nature park! 16 of us stayed here and everyone kept going on how much they loved the hotel. Lovely bar downstairs with plenty of places to chill outside too with some drinks. Our rooms were quirky and we all had different rooms which was nice as it made it more to talk about! The lady with the long brown hair checking us in couldn't of been nicer and was so helpful! The pressure of making a group booking I thought someone would complain but no everyone loved this hotel and would go back. It is outside the city centre so you are better to get cabs into the main town bit but there is places you can walk to easily. We actually appriecated being out of the centre. ,5,2018,04,09
100,Beautiful hotel and excellent service!,Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and it was brilliant.  The location was really good and close to the centre as well as many of the great attractions Amsterdam has to offer. I would recommend this hotel to all. ,5,2018,04,09
100,Weekend Trip,"Hotel grounds were excellent, reception desk during check in was a complete disaster, and service was very slow, hotel staff got confused with payments for breakfast, room was clean / tidy, bed on upper floor, access to bed was very narrow and steep, from window was overlooking part of hotel and the rest building site.",3,2018,04,09
100,Nice hotel but price-performance ratio not accurate,Nice hotel in a lovely park but still a good 25-30 minute walk into the center. Check in and out was easy and staff was very nice. The room wasn't all clean and had a few stains on the night table and couch. Stairs in the duplex room were quite narrow,3,2018,04,07
100,Not the cleanest,"Nice hotel with lovely seating areas outside. Lovely food at the bar. Only down side was the room, we threw our bags in and left and when we came back there was hair shavings all over the steps up to the bed and a spilt pink juice beside the sofa that had been there for quite some time. Room was very warm and stuffy and could hear things from other rooms which was scary in the middle of the night when you thought someone was coming up your stairs. We still had a lovely time but wouldn’t come back to this hotel.",2,2018,04,07
100,Would re-visit for sure,"The decor and the atmosphere at Hotel Arena is at the good end of the scale. Modern and relaxed, but with respect for the history of the partially old building (a former convent/church). There are a few gems at this place, make sure you explore more than the reception and the bar.
We were greeted by friendly staff when we checked in. The same goes for visits to the restaurant.

The room was pretty much just as I like it.
It was possible to turn off the heating system completely, meaning you are not forced to sleep in a overheated room, which unfortunately is the case at many hotels. Furthermore it was possible to open the window, allowing for fresh air and a good sleep in a cooled, ventilated room. The bed was great, I had two nights with a good sleep.
The duvet is quite thick and warm, but having the bed to myself I could switch pillows during the night, when I needed to move to the cool side. It was a double duvet, which would have been annoying had this been a private trip with my girlfriend. Sleeping alone it was just fine.

The TV is was a little older but it worked. The number of non-Dutch channels was very limited, but with the new roaming laws in EU there’s always a streaming service you can use hassle free.

Breakfast was quite nice. I strongly suspect the vast majority of the offerings were pre-prepared and not made by the hotel, but it was still above what you experience at many hotels of this category.
I was less happy with the dinner we decided to have at the hotel one evening. My medium rare steak was more medium than rare.
On a side note: Breakfast was not until 07:00, which I felt was a bit late on a weekday. I assume it’s based on demand and it probably makes sense, just don’t show up at 06:30. 
07:00 if still early enough to avoid rush hour.

The restaurant is a cosy, relaxed area, quite nice for a few drinks or a night cap.

There is a park adjacent to the hotel, which only adds to the experience.
The location is a bit off centre, but if you want a hotel without the city noise, this is a good alternative. It’s about 25-35 minutes walk to the centre of Amsterdam, or a short cab ride.

I don’t think they had free Wi-Fi in the room, but I’m somewhat sure you can get a connection in the reception area.",4,2018,04,06
100,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great location, local shops and places to eat near by. Distance not far from ice bar and red light district. Staff very welcoming and bar lovely place to have a drinks. Hotel sits inside one of the parks and tram stop only outside, so easy to travel round or take a uber.",5,2018,04,06
100,"Great Setting, quirky in a good way, and not so good way","The building is a converted orphanage with all sorts of angles and stairwells.  The room was larger than most one bedrooms in Europe for the price.  The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of Dam Square and the Redlight District, but an easy tram ride or interesting 20-25 minute walk past the National Zoo and the Jewish History Museums.  The restaurant was crowded and not great in the evening.  Forget about paying 19 Euro apiece for breakfast- go next door to the hostel and pay half the price.  There are very few dining options in the area so plan on eating out- way out. The service was generally good, but not even.  Our reservations in the restaurant were not made, our room not cleaned until 6:00 PM. All-in-all it is a good value despite the inconsistencies.",4,2018,04,05
100,Lovely hotel ,"Classy hotel, great staff and quirky bedroom. 

Clean and modern hotel with a historical past. 

Bedroom was on 2 floors with a spiral staircase, quirky but not great after a night out in Amsterdam! 

Walking distance to city 30 mins. Walkable or the hotel can call you a cab or hire a bike! 

Lovely coffee shop onsite.... we didn’t have breakfast so unable to comment. 

30 euros per day for garage parking onsite.

100,Perfect ! ,"Beautiful place, perfect bedding, nice staff, the room with the big bath and the italian shower are really pleasant, and the room is cute. The bar and the restaurant : good kitchen and cocktails, place decorated with taste. We recommand !",5,2018,04,04
100,Best place to stay in Amsterdam,"The people, the restaurant, the whole experience is awesome. Very well located, the hotel is as espectacular as confortable. The atention of the staff, the food from the restaurant, everything we experienced blew our minds. Hoping to be back soon!",5,2018,04,04
100,Really cool staff and amasing area,"it was really amazing hotel, the staff was so cool and the area of hotel was wonderful. the Arena hotel is beside the oost park, and the entrance was through the park. it was three minutes walking to the tram station, that you can access all the Amsterdam attractions",5,2018,04,04
100,"Nice setting, lacking in detail. ","Well located and easy to reach hotel, in a lovely park. Nice concept, with the chapel refurbished and a mix of old and new pieces throughout the hotel. Nice looking restaurant (we didn’t eat there through) overlooking the park.

The staff was kind, responsive and helpful. 

The first room we got was with a nice new bathroom with shower, and large bed in the open mezzanine. It was nicely decorated, but was lacking in the details (paint chipping a bit, air flow making noises) but globally lovely. Unfortunately it had a buzzing noise coming and going from the Bathroom that woke us up a few time. In the morning management was quick to propose to check was it was, and eventually change us to a new room. They were very nice and responsive. On the evening we were moved to another bigger room, with a different decoration and a bath. 

The second room was larger, with a bathroom with a large bath. Same structure, different decoration. That one must have been an older aisle of the hotel as the paint was clearly chipping in the bathroom with humidity, the fridge was leaking water... On the second morning, our towels were just thrown/stack up wet (not folded) on the rack, and the bed was barely done. No tea were put back for us to have the next evening/morning. 

While it is a lovely setting and nice concept, the hotel is very much lacking in detail and need some renovation. 
Staff is very nice though ! ",3,2018,04,03
100,Fantastic one of a kind hotel.,"Loved Hotel Arena from the second I saw it walking through the park. Old gothic feel and beautiful naturally lit rooms. Had a couple of issues with the key cards (stopped working), the cleaner (walking in whilst 'do not disturb' sign was on), ordering drinks (asked for milk 3 times) and requesting more pillows (never came) but overall was good. Ladies at reception were some of the best in the business and always extremely happy to help.",4,2018,04,03
100,Worst Hotel Service with nice view - Carefull !,"Find other if you don t want to live the situations below; 

- Waiting in the lobby for the not ready room.
(It was 14.00 and two times they said 1 hour later so we waited 2 hours finally we left and came back at night.)

- Dealing with unhappy and unprofsesional Supervisors or managers in the Front Desk. 
(While trying to get my room their behaviour was not professional. This is not hospitality. Also they could not use their PMS efficiently.)

- Walking is not a choice but geting lost with the many connections to city center is. 
(Get ready to change the tram 2 or 3 times)

- Dirtiest rooms that you will have.
 (As a housekeeping manager I can cleary say that stay away !) 

- Poorest bathroom and room amenities that will make u shocked.
(NO WATER, no bottled bathrooms amenities, just one tiny pillow on the bed etc.)

- Getting cold beacuse of the poor heating system.
(Even tough it was in the hi level and set to 30, te room was cold)",1,2018,04,02
100,Amazing Hotel,"Perfect Hotel! Situated just outside of the city, with trams into the city regularly and only a 5 min journey into the heart of the city. With its beautiful views looking over the park it is peaceful and tranquil. The staff are so helpful and polite from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, nothing was an issue. The reception staff were always smiling , they recommended places to go and showed us on a map and how to get there. If you want a place to stay that is close to the city but without the hustle and bustle this is the place to stay, amazing hotel with amazing staff.",5,2018,04,02
100,Weekend away - ask for a newer room! Too hot to sleep!,"Our first impressions were really good - the location of the hotel was beautiful - right in the park and the receptionist was very helpful. I had emailed previously to ask for a nice view as the weekend was a surprise for my partners 30th birthday. However on arrival the room was on the ground floor overlooking not much! 
The room was clean however and had everything we needed.
When we returned after our evening meal the room was very warm. We put the air conditioning on but it would only go to 20 degrees! As the sleeping area was upstairs the heat was trapped up there. We tried to sleep but we were up throughout the night - at 2am we went to reception. A woman was sent down but she also could not get the temperature down. My partner asked to move rooms but we were told no rooms were available. The night porter offered to find us another hotel but at a cost to us.
We were very disappointed - he was not very understanding at all! No apology even.
My partner slept on the very small leather sofa which was very uncomfortable and not what I was paying for. 
The next day we approached reception again and the lady was wonderful. She quickly found us another room and we could move our stuff straight away. It was disappointing that we had to approach them. Definitely ask for a newer bedroom. It was much better - we could leave the window open as it was on the second floor and because it was larger the air flow was much better. 
So overall location was good, area was lovely (great bars/restaurants/chilled out) second room was beautiful, very clean rooms.",3,2018,04,02
100,"Beautiful hotel, great location, but should spend time fixing the basics","Design and facilities are beautiful, but cleanliness and other little fixes should be improved a LOT. for a hotel of this standard, the rooms should be immaculate and the cleaning staff should do a much better job. But the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and decorated very tastefully. It's also super nicely located in a park",3,2018,04,02
100,Don't go in the winter or early spring,"I visited this hotel in March 2018. My room was freezing cold. The first night I was unable to warm it and eventually had to run with shower on hot for an extended period to warm it up. The second night the hotel was able to provide me with a portable heater. However, while I was sitting in the lobby that night, I heard person after person come up to the front desk of the hotel and complain that their room was freezing. The hotel was out of heaters so none of these people were able to get a heater.

Otherwise the hotel was nice, and I would visit here in the summer. However, the temperature was just around freezing the nights I was there, which is not unusual for Amsterdam. I would strongly recommend against staying here during the winter or early spring.

100,"Wonderful property, most friendly staff and great restaurant ","I was here with my friends exploring the city, we come every year to shop, hang around and have a good talk. Arena is at the upcoming east side of the city, superb building at the park, great rooms and the most cozy restaurant ever. Staff was one of the most friendly I have ever seen. I have heard that there was a management change and that had a great effect on the hotel, we will not look anymore hotels in Amsterdam, we will just come back here, thank you very much guys .",5,2018,04,01
100,"Cool hotel with a good vibe, but with some minuses","Positives: The hotel looks cool and it has a nice vibe and a cool bar. It’s also nicely located close to a cute park, and it is quite central. The guys working in the bar were very friendly and nice, and the breakfast was good. The rooms are also big. 

Negatives: The rooms are quite old, meaning they don’t look very nice and you can hear everything your neighbors are taking about through the wall. 

There is no cold water in the room, meaning you have to buy water for drinking and brushing your teeth. There is also no minibar in the rooms, and the shower water is very hot. 

Also, one of the girls in the hotel lobby told us we can get a cab to the airport for a standard price (44 euro) and that it was just to book when we needed it. This is not true however, as the taxi driver told us the fixed rate only comes if you pre-book. Her ignorance/arrogance (she was quite rude) cost us 15 euros more than she had promised us. 

All in all it is a cool hotel with a nice location, but there are some elements that can definitely be better about this hotel. ",3,2018,04,01
100,Surprisingly friendly,"Breathtaking hotel, with amazingly decorated interiors amd rooms with a lot of light. Very comfortable and big beds. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Perfect for couples/young couples. Quite near from the center, with public transport within 5 minuts walking. The only downside is that is located in a park and since 6pm you can't cross it because there are not very nice people.",4,2018,03,31
100,Beautiful Hotel.,"I thoroughly recommend this hotel! The location was so beautiful and peaceful, which made a nice contrast to the busyness of central Amsterdam. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was AMAZING - we booked a standard room and two floors!! Restaurant was just stunning. We loved this hotel and will be staying here again when we next come to Amsterdam. 

Would be 5* but some parts needed a little upkeep (for example; scuffs on the walls or curtains). As well, the maid only pulled the sheets over the bed and swapped the towels, plus they ran out of teabags! Nothing too important, but makes the difference between 4* and 5*. 

See you soon Hotel Arena!",4,2018,03,31
100,Lovely place at Amsterdam,"You should appear after 3 o'clock, you could leave your baggage at the safe boxes, it's better to take tram 7 to the metro station if you want to go to the city center. I recommend to buy 1-day ticket for all kinds of the public transport",4,2018,03,30
100,Great Hotel,"Hotel's location is amazing, its located in a city park. which you can do jogging and stuff. Hotel's decorations are so minimal and nice, also rooms are very nice and cosy. We loved it, higly Recommended.",5,2018,03,27
100,"Beautiful rooms, great location, fantastic staff","Stayed here with my dad for his 80th birthday.  The hotel is located in a quiet part of the city, just three stops on the Metro from the main Central Station and next to a park.

The rooms were very large and well maintained.  Staff were incredibly friendly, in both the hotel and the bar. They left a small bottle of champagne in my Dad's room for us to to celebrate his birthday - a nice gesture.

Although my Dad's room was affected by flooding on the second day (the room above had left their taps on), he was upgraded to an even nicer room.

There was no charge or hassle when I lost my room key.

Highly recommended, especially if you prefer not to stay in the more touristy central part of the city.",5,2018,03,27
100,Amazing Value ,"I stayed at Hotel Arena from the 21st-26th of March. Being lovers of Amsterdam, we used watching England vs the Netherlands football as an excuse to have another holiday here. 
The hotel settings are lovely, and the park is great to stroll around at all times of day, it always seems busy but peaceful! There are a couple of close tram stops and a train and metro station all within walking distance making it a great base for getting around the city. 
Upon arrival, we were told that the room we had originally booked was unavailable and were upgraded to a kingsize duplex room in the newer part of the hotel, while it seemed small at first, it was actually a perfect size for a couple, with a modern bathroom and sitting area located on the lower floor, and a large bed, tv, and desk on the upper mezzanine floor. The layout of this was only really an issue when needing the toilet during the night as the stairs are a little difficult to manoeuvre when sleepy. Other than this the room was great, with a full length window from the floor to the ceiling with amazing views of the park! 
The hotel has a cafe/bar and although we didn’t personally try this, is was always fairly busy so must be worth a visit. As well as this, on the Friday and Saturday night the hotel hosted events including a live band, although I’m not sure whether this is available to guests or if it was a special function. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a getaway outside of all the busyness and noise of the city, but within close distance. ",5,2018,03,26
100,Great For Big Groups,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel with 3 other couples and we had a great time! The rooms were all big and clean, and the bar downstairs was great to meet up in for snacks and drinks before hitting the town every evening. It was also central to a very good shopping center and only about a 9 minute bike ride from all of the major districts, so very convenient!",5,2018,03,26
100,Seems good,"Nice place, professional team, great location. Seems good. Particularly enjoyed how easy it was to get to anywhere in Amsterdam from here. The room was bigger than I expected, and very comfortable. Pity about the cost of the drinks in the bar(!).",4,2018,03,26
100,Poor rooms with leaking showers and smelly as well.,"The shower leaked and the staff only came to clean it so that the problem persevere.  The fridge smelled badly as well. In the bar, they spilled a beer all over my clothes and they couldn't do anything as the dry cleaners wouldn't deliver until Monday.  We were leaving on Sunday.  Unsatisfactory.",1,2018,03,26
100,"Nice hotel, helpful staff.  Don't come if you're gluten-free or hungry!","Liked the duplex room, but if you have bad knees the staircase may be difficult.  Food delicious but TINY portions.  Very little provision for gluten-free, despite asking several days in a row.  Lovely, polite staff.",3,2018,03,24
100,Nice hotel. Good value.,"Gothic style hotel, main building was formerly a church with some modern extensions added. Situated in the east park (oosterpark) of Amsterdam, which is really pretty. Tram stop is 100m away, Metro station 600m away and an Albert Heijn supermarket a few hundred metres away. About a 20-30min walk to the centre of Amsterdam. 'The Park' bar/restaurant was really nice, with good food and good service. Nice sitting by the fire with a beer. Room was okay, with a safe & mini fridge. 2 single beds,  a sofa and a desk & chair. Decor all white. Good quality pillows & duvet. Bathroom was very nice & spacious. No info in room about the hotel & services provided so you will need to ask e.g breakfast is 19 euros. Housekeeping was poor in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in, but was not a big issue. 
Overall a good base from which to explore and good value for a 4* hotel.",4,2018,03,22
100,Beautiful Hotel,"Delighted with style and decor of the hotel. Beautiful renovated rooms. 
Service cannot be better or more pleasant. Definitely will return as my son will be attending the University of Rotterdam which is virtually next door!",5,2018,03,22
100,Short City Trip,"Nice ad friendly team, great and unique location, really nice design of common rooms & restaurant, good food and nice lounge areas. The weather was really really cold and the house was experiencing some trouble with the heating systems. But they did everything to help with the situation.",4,2018,03,22
100,They take money from your account without permission.,"Hotel is lovely, rooms are average. Lovely bar / restaurant area. 

However I am really angry with how this hotel operates. I only received part of my holding deposit back due to a mystery SEPARATE VAT invoice being deducted from it. So basically EVERYTHING you buy inside the hotel is ex VAT so expect a large sneaky invoice (that i never even saw a copy of until i questioned the missing money I noticed from my account). 

I was charged city tax on checkout of 15% per night? Google says it should be 5%. I questioned hotel but have not received an explanation. 

Still fighting to get my money back. Absolutely shocking. Staff need training. This is borderline illegal in my opinion.",1,2018,03,21
100,Perfect Location to discover Amsterdam an chillax,We did a Family citytrip with our parents. We all had a amazing time; the Location is slo beautyful: quite but Close to the Center.

100,"Great location, cool building","Loved the place. Peaceful and quiet without being boring and modern without being cold or uncomfortable. Friendly staff. Restaurant-cafe looked very inviting although I didn't go. One of the best luggage storage solutions I've seen in a hotel: spacious lockers around the reception, easily accessible and the most useful asset when exploring town after check out.one minus point for the service as no bicycles were available. (No problem though: Next door generator hostel had one for me.)",5,2018,03,20
100,Tranquil atmosphere,"I stayed in Hotel Arena for business but it makes you feel
like your in a holiday. With a very nice view from the outside while having your early breakfast, coffee and tea to start your day and buffet to select from.

 It has a combination of modern and classic interiors. The room is very organize and clean, except for the mirror that has cracked on it, but would look way even better if it’s replace. 

The customer service is amazing. Very quick to respond for my internet issues. The waiters and waitresses are very fast in attending the customers and ensures you will be accomodated.

On top of it the Hotel has a very nice ambiance. Tranquility at it’s best!",4,2018,03,19
100,Lovely hotel - Bathroom with open glass is a NO!,"Had a lovely stay here with my mum. The entrance and lobby are beautiful, with the hotel bedrooms being simple, clean and elegant. 

The bathroom is a pod in the middle of the room and had blackened glass which you can see right through it you are in the bed or in the room at all!

It was very uncomfortable and especially with my mum I would prefer privacy. 

Overall a great hotel. ",4,2018,03,18
100,Nice hotel ... few points to improve,"all in all perfect hotel for a City trip, rooms with bedroom upstairs definitely not suitable for small children or elderly persons, located in a park, metro, bus etc nearby, like the interior of the hotel and the history of the building",4,2018,03,16
100,4 Star ‘Hotel-In-the-Park’,"Excellent 4 Star park located on the east side of Amsterdam within the confines of Oosterpark. Great hotel with great service, good food.

100,Wonderful stay! ,"My wife and l stayed at the Arena hotel over the weekend of our first wedding anniversary. All the staff, from the receptionists to the restaurant staff knew it was our anniversary and their attentiveness was incredible. Our children had a few surprises arranged, and we also had prosecco and balloons in our room from the hotel. It is very quiet and we walked into the city centre, although the hotel is on two tram routes. We'd definitely stay here again!
",5,2018,03,08
100,Nice venue,"Without any doubt the location and atmosphere are outrageous and very stylish! The young stuff is really nice and friendly. The area is spaceous and the localization at the edge of a nice park is very relaxing. Food and beverage left a mixed impression: The breakfast buffet was absolutely the best I’ve seen the last year. Everything was absolutely fresh and of highest quality. however, the price of 21,5€ per person also is pretty high... For dinner I had an excellent cod, my friend had some boring ravioli not even homemade..... Speaking of prices: we had a very tiny room under the roof. It was cozy in a way, but far, far too expensive for the comfort it offered! It did not even have hair shampoo or body lotion. Besides, it was very noisy due to fire door on the corridor that slacked whole night through and the aircon, that went on with a heavy noise, though turned completely off... ",4,2018,03,08
100,"Charming, friendly hotel","Loved this hotel, stayed 4 nights recently.  Staff was some of the most friendly, helpful of any hotels we've stayed.  Beautiful old building with gorgeous architectural features.  Located beside a lovely large park.  A quiet location, a little away from hubbub of central Amsterdam, but within easy walking distance of great Albert Cuyp street market (fresh stroopwaffels and poffertjes!!!) and great dePijp neighborhood with lots of restaurants, shops..  Most Amsterdam tourist sites were within 30 minute walk, and tram stop was close if you preferred less walking.  ",4,2018,03,04
100,Fantastic hotel,"The hotel was brilliant for our recent stay in Amsterdam, not too fdar away from Dam square. Staff incredible when we had the unfortunate accident with one of our party breaking an ankle, they could not do enough for us.

100,Good value hotel on the verge of the city,"Hotel Arena is pleasant, although unusual, hotel about 30 mins walk and 10 mins metro ride outside of the city centre. 
Public areas are smart, with a nice bar area and open fire.  Rooms are really un-usual; we stayed in standard room which was split over two levels, with a glass box bathroom and bright white living area on the group floor and a sleeping area up a tight spiral staircase.  The room was perfectly comfortable, clean and quiet, however some of the furnishings were a bit tired and worn.  Only minor niggle was no proper milk, a limited variety of coffee/tea and a lack of biscuits in rooms - but this was no real issue!
Overall, very pleasant stay aided by the friendly staff. Would definitely return.",4,2018,02,26
100,Business Trip,"stayed there for 2 nights for a business trip, the hotel is spacious and provided everything you need, the park is just outside the hotel doors which was amazing, food was nice and room service food was good too, the only constructive feedback I would like to provide is that there was only 1 staff member at the check in desk and there was a queue which took sometime to check in, other than that I would happily stay there again",4,2018,02,22
100,Lovely but loud,Hotel was nice and very clean and all the staff were very personable and welcoming. Only issue was how loud it was. We were in a standard double room and it seemed that anything and everything in the corridor and above us could be heard from the room. You could hear the toilet flush above you and the wooden floors meant that any footstep seemed so loud it put you off your sleep. Not recommended for someone who’s a light sleeper however the rest of the hotel and facilities were excellent. ,4,2018,02,21
100,Brilliant Staff and Hotel but Horrendous Room,"Positives
- Stunning building 
- Next to nice park
- Easy enough to get to city centre
- Staff are very good
- Lockers

Negative
- We had a mezanine room which was very poorly designed
- Ground floor cramped and very little room to move around
- Whoever designed the bathroom should be ashamed. It is right in the middle of the room and so no privacy. Second, the shower is very powerful (I guess a positive), but draining poor and floor level HIGHER than in the main section of the room so all you need to take is a 5 minute shower and you will begin to flood the rest of the room.
- Upstairs area had kettle yet no water supply, minor annoyance to run up and down stairs but really sums up how little practical thought was put into the design.
- Expensive for the quality of the room
- Late check in time and early check out time.",3,2018,02,20
100,Parking nearly as expensive as room,"€90 for three days, disgusting price for a patron, next there will be a charge for using the lift.

Hotel and staff were friendly enough. Rooms have character but minor things such as dirt all under the bed and mattress not fitting properly ruined it.

100,"Strange Bathrooms, Lovely hotel","Arrived and the hotel is very impressive looking inside and out, check in was simple and room was very nice apart from the bathroom which has no walls just glass window that faced into the bedroom, not ideal for privacy. only other problem we had was we was never asked for the city tax upon check in, because of this every night we got back to our room late on our room card had been disabled meaning we had to go back down to reception to sort this, was only told on the last night of our stay that this was down to the city tax, very inconvenient.",4,2018,02,18
100,Amazing place to stay! ,"We stayed in a duplex room which was cosy and beautiful. The staff are very polite and helpful, the bar and restaurant is amazing. The decor was gorgeous. Not too far from metro or tram links to centre. Highly recommend.",5,2018,02,17
100,Amazing hotel,Did my research before visiting Amsterdam. Not too far out the way so booked this one. Glad I did as on the day it was fully booked. The building and rooms are beautiful. Even have doorbells on the rooms. Would definitely go back. Walking distance is about half an hour but you can get an uber for €15 which takes about ten mins. The bar food and drink menu are reasonably priced if not a tad cheaper than some you get in the centre. Two min walk down the road is a cafe with great breakfasts too called Maxwell. ,5,2018,02,14
100,Birthday weekend away with best friend ,"Really clean, modern and spacious hotel. Staff were really nice and friendly providing transport info. 

Transport was very near (met) to get into the centre was easy to use. 

Overall a lovely hotel and would stay again. ",5,2018,02,12
100,Room not worth it!,"Business trip or not, definitely not coming back. Bed is super cheap and soft - my back hearts, bath is big and it would be relaxing but shame that shower is super unpractical (you need to be in a funny position to get some water and wash your hair) plus either it’s super hot or cold.  
The room I stayed in is split in two levels being connected with super uncomfortable stairs! The lightning is poor and furniture super old. I don’t mind old or not but old with not being clean becomes terrible! The bath was with hair and so the floor! ",1,2018,02,12
100,Amazing hotel situated in beautiful park! ,"Stayed 3 nights here and was blown away from the moment we got there! Hotel is in a beautiful park with a lake out the front, staff were great when checking in provided us with gloves and everything as very cold! Rooms were great and quite unique seating area and bathroom downstairs then stairs up to bedroom! The hotel is only a 25/30 min walk to square so we just walked most of the time as weather was good although trams available. Loved the seating area at bar with fire in front of it. Only down side was rooms were extremely warm at night and service at bar/restaurant slow , we ordered a snack of bread and humous and took 30 mins to come and the following night we ordered 2 gin and tonics and took about 25 min wait for them! Other than that this hotel is great and I would definitely go back!",5,2018,02,11
100,Atmospheric building in the misty park,"We spent 2 nights in December. It's a bit outside of the touristic centre, you can take the tram ( 10 min to the museums or you can walk 30 min). The room was excellent. Beautiful windows, high ceilings, bed's mattress comfortable, transparent shower. A very calm atmosphere to relax. You can feel a bit of grandiosity in the hotel's  corridors and the bar- kitchen service correct. Outside the park gives you another relaxing feeling, specially in misty nights.",5,2018,02,08
100,Anniversary ,"Came here with my boyfriend at the beginning of January. Was absolutely lovely. It was very last minute. The I was great. On arrival they had put rose petals and a small bottle of prosecco out for us which was so sweet. For anyone visiting Dam square etc, it’s super close, you can walk to the station. Which is about 2 stops (couple minutes) to dam central, then the redlight district etc is within walking distance from there. Or you can get tram
From the hotel to the station ( no point though as only a 5 min walk). Never ate in the hotel as was a bit pricy but the staff were very helpful. Bathroom was beautiful. Definitely one of the nicest hotels we’ve stayed in. Thanks !!!! 
",5,2018,02,04
100,Could do better,The hotel needs money spending on it and the cleaning needs a complete stern eye.  It could be so brilliant but it is lacks the personal touch.  On arrival reception isn't in the foyer it's down the corridor.,2,2018,01,28
100,Can’t recommend this property highly enough,We stayed for 3 nights in December just before Christmas from the moment the taxi dropped us off I knew it would be great.  The building is so cool and inside didn’t disappoint. Lots of quirky art and modern style.  The staff at reception and the restaurant where so friendly And it was such a nice place to return to.   The hotel is a short tram ride from Centraal but I found it nice to be out of the craziness.  Breakfast was fantastic and we ate dinner in the restaurant each night great options and priced well.  We had the perfect start to our holiday staying here.  One of Amsterdam’s best kept secrets,5,2018,01,25
100,False face hotel,This hotel is not 200 meters from the main square as it is advertised it is 20 minuets by tram. First room they tried to put us in was dirty mould and damp around windows bathroom smelt of mould. Bedroom stains on sheets and sticky substance on the bedside shelves ?. Second room was cleaner ?. For what it was this room is not what you want to stay in for a weekend a box room tweaked to look good (fail) felt like a cell. We had a great holiday in Amsterdam but the hotel put a bad taste to it. Not allowed to take my drink outside after 8 pm why? On the hotel terrace over looking the park. No food after 10.30 pm from the kitchen so if your peckish you stay that way because there are no food places close by and shops are closed. Could not recommend this hotel totally inadequate staff and facilities very poor. Bad experience,2,2018,01,25
100,Not suitable for business at all,"- room service menu is very minimal, nothing healthy
- iron board dirty
- iron is also dirty, will mess your nice shirts up. Did it with 2 of mine, see pics uploaded
- windows basically cant be closed, very cold
- long list of other negatives, just after 3 hours of being here",2,2018,01,16
100,Wonderful ambience!,"Beautiful situated in “the middle” of busy Amsterdam. The room, first floor and recently refurbished was small but clean.  Very unfortunate that no window can be opened. That’s why the upstairs bedroom is way to warm. The airco did not compensate. Staff friendly. Breakfast was more than okay. 
All in all a very good experience! ",4,2018,01,16
100,Overated,"We requested a double bed however they were two beds pushed together which resulted one of us sleeping in a gap which was very unpleasant/unromantic. 

The shower wasn't properly drained so the bathroom floor was always wet.
At night we kept hearing other guests enter/leave the floor. So if you are a light sleeper you won't get much sleep here.

We paid a lot of money for a poor experience.",2,2018,01,15
100,"Gracious staff, elegant hotel","My husband and I stayed in room #162 for nearly two weeks. First, we were impressed at how very gracious, responsive and professional all of the hotel employees were. They answered all our questions, gave us every accommodation we requested, and always with a smile. That includes not only the reception desk staff but also the two people, one man and one woman, who cleaned our room and kept us supplied with everything we needed. 

The hotel, a restored former psychiatric hospital for women, is clean, safe, and beautiful, albeit with a sort of gothic atmosphere. High ceilings, ornate staircases, large windows, and white draperies everywhere give the place an elegant, if not somewhat austere, feel. Its location, in a nice park and near the tram and metro, is quite convenient. We enjoyed our stay there and would definitely recommend Hotel Arena to our friends.

We have some small criticisms that are meant for the hotel management and not the lovely employees. First, renting out the chapel for New Year’s Eve to a disco/party organizer called Hed Kandi may be part of a multi-use business model but hotel guests shouldn’t be inconvenienced or marginalized by a one-off event.

Second, while we found our room mostly comfortable (the bed was divine) and enjoyed the view of a canal, the room design is flawed. Enclosing the bathroom in tinted glass may look good but doesn’t work well in reality. Even couples who have been together for a long time prefer privacy in the toilet. The bathroom lighting is impossible for applying makeup and the single outlet there doesn’t work for anything other than a shaver. There were no drawers, so we had to keep our suitcases on the sofa to access our clothes. And the wall that served as a headboard and room divider was not attached well to the floor and rocked back and forth when we tried to sit up in bed to read.

No doubt the management will address these issues in time, as Hotel Arena is still a fairly new enterprise, and future guests will enjoy their stays as much as we did.",4,2018,01,10
100,Beautiful and Well Located Hotel,This hotel is absolutely stunning inside and out. Located on the Oosterpark it is the perfect place to go for walks but it is also only a 10 minute tram ride away from the centre. Personally my boyfriend and I used uber which was extremely cheap in comparison to London prices. We also ate a meal at the restaurant which was delicious but I might say slightly overpriced since other higher quality restaurants in the heart of Amsterdam were cheaper. Would definitely recommend.,5,2018,01,06
100,Lovely 4 night stay,"Room was excellent couldn’t recommend this hotel enough staff lovely, perfect location was the perfect time away knowing we were staying at this lovely establishment didn’t try the restaurant but it looked amazing every time we passed by",5,2018,01,03
100,Impressive building but bad sleeping,"The hotel itself is amazing, very nice renovation!
Staff was helpful to us, good service in general.
Quality of sleep however was not OK. First of all the bed was so soft, it felt like a hammock. Pillows way too thick.
And maybe worst of all: the AC system passes on all sounds from other rooms.",3,2018,01,01
100,Such a beautiful hotel! ,"We stayed at Hotel Arena for a night before we go back home. It was such a great hotel to end our Europe Trip. The building is stunning, full of artistic features. To enter the hotel, we had to go through Oosterpark. Front desk staff was very welcoming and professional. Our room was beautiful with a nice view. To make it even better, the bed and pillows are super comfortable. We really didn’t wanna leave the hotel. We didnt get a chance to enjoy the breakfast at the restaurant but we ordered desserts from the Park Restaurant which were amazing! The only negative is there are a few wear and tear with the paint though out the room and a few minor maintenance works to be done. We will definitely be back next time! Thanks for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,12,27
100,Weekend birthday treat,"I booked a two night stay at Hotel Arena for my boyfriends birthday. We arrived at the check time and were properly allocated our room. I had booked a standard duplex double which is a split level room with a huge comfy bed, double story length window and tiny steep staircase. The room was clean and well maintained throughout our short stay. The minibar fridge isn't stocked upon arrival but you can stock it with various items of your own or from the selection downstairs in the main reception. The hotel is also clean with beautiful contemporary designs that complement the old architecture of the building. Its location is just outside the main center of the city which, if your feeling quite active you could easily walk to (we walked the whole time, except late at night). But there are many taxis, trams around and the metro isn't too far to walk. The hotel sits on the edge of a beautiful park which I'm sure in the summer would be a beautiful place to relax. There is also a trendy restaurant downstairs which serves food all day. If your planning on having breakfast during your stay, better to get there early as we found most of the food is gone quite quickly and isn't stocked very frequently. They also provided various teas and coffee to take away. The staff were friendly, informative and accommodating.",4,2017,12,25
100,Winter break,"Had a fantastic 2 night stay. The hotel is stunning the rooms are spacious and very clean. We asked to be moved as the room we were in was extremely hot, we were moved to a new room within half an hour and this was at 22.30. The staff were very efficient and helpful. The Oosterpark where the hotel is situated is stunning. 
Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2017,12,20
100,Beautiful Hotel,"I recently stayed in the Hotel Arena for 4 nights with my friend on a sightseeing trip, the location is brilliant for tram services to and from the centre! About a 5 minute walk to the tram that takes you to Dam Square.

If you’re looking for a picturesque hotel then this is the one! Set at the back of Oosterpark, this hotel has lovely views of the park and easy access. Whilst being situated within the park, it is a very well lit area at night. The steps however outside of the hotel are partial to being slippery when wet. 

The hotel itself is strangely loud at night with people slamming doors & the walls are VERY thin, can almost hear nextdoors full conversation when lied in bed. We stayed in a split floor room and the heating was ridiculous, even after the heating being turned off completely, we still had to sleep with no cover, in the middle of December!

The split rooms are ideal to give yourself more space. The bathroom is located on the lower half of the room; all the walls being nearly see through and no proper door, so you would need to be comfortable with your partner or friend. 
Also on the lower part of the room is the wardrobe, which holds an ironing board and iron, a safe and a clothes maiden. There is a tv, sofa, writing desk and fridge also on this floor. 
Upstairs (steep stairs) is the bedroom! A HUGE bed and bedside tables with a tv.

Please feel free to ask any questions I will be happy to help.",4,2017,12,20
100,"actual, nice and near to the center","Amsterdam was snowed and the airport closed for a couple of days, but we have spent 5 walking in the city and 2 days in this hotel very confortable in the middle of a garden , the meals, personnel, ... everything to enjoy this city. near to metro, bus and in a beautiful and quiet quartier. and the best is the price!",4,2017,12,20
100,Gorgeous place!,"Came here for my wife's birthday and had a lovely time. Nice room, good service and would definitely come again. The park and restaurant are stunning! We were lucky enough to get snow which made it very romantic.",5,2017,12,18
100,Peaceful Oasis in a Busy City,"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Arena while attending a conference within the hotel. It was a lovely quiet location without any traffic noise as our room overlooked a central courtyard.
The property was undergoing an upgrade during our visit, and this will certainly enhance this property. It's proximity to the park was wonderful, however getting to the hotel entrance with the upgrade work was confusing.
The room was spacious and comfortable. 
The breakfast provided a huge range of options, and able to suit all your breakfast desires.  With freshly made Barista coffee, it was great way to start the day.
The meals provided during the conference were tasty and well presented too.
If I needed to be in Amsterdam again, I would certainly stay in this hotel again.",5,2017,12,12
100,Nice hotel and good location,"Stayed here for several nights over a couple of weeks on business. The hotel is nicely styled and certainly unique. The reception staff are helpful and friendly as are the bar staff. The bar is a nice place to chill out for a drink. The food menu is ok but there is not a huge choice, there are plenty of other places to eat nearby which offer better value, choice and quality.
I had a noise issue with my room which I politely complained about. The staff were very accommodating and changed my room with no issues and were apologetic. Very good service.
Some parts of the hotel are a little worn but overall it’s good. Room prices are reasonable for a city centre but breakfast is expensive unless you stuff your faces each morning.
I like this hotel and would recommend it for a short city break in this beautiful city.",4,2017,12,10
100,"Terrible stay, uninterested dismissive staff ","Stayed Monday to Friday at hotel arena in October. The location was okay, could catch tram into more central area right outside the hotel. The tram location was a big part of the problem as they passed by our room (070) from early early in the morning till midnight ringing bell and rattling by (sounded like a plane taking off) This something that can’t be helped but people should be wary of when being given their room. The rooms in that corridor (new wing) are awful.

The noise level is outrageous, the delivery bay was right outside our window and you would have sworn they were in the room throwing things around. First thing every morning the lorries would arrive banging trolleys, throwing stage and music equipment into lorries. I’ve never experienced anything like this wherever I’ve stayed.

We tolerated the noise all week from the deliveries however on the final night we stayed the hotel was hosting a private function( which they told us the do every Thursday Friday and Saturday night). The pounding music went on all through the night, we did not get a single minute sleep. To add insult to injury at 8.30am they started loading all the metal staging and music equipment into the lorry outside our window. 

When I approached staff I spoke with the manager Alexander and another staff member who were very dismissive saying their was nothing they could do as the hotel had been booked for a private function and they couldn’t help the noise all night or stop them loading their equipment. 

They were totally uninterested in my complaint. The refused to compensate us for the previous night and advised all they could do was give us a free breakfast and wave the 20 pound city tax.

They were not interested in us as paying customers as they obviously bring in a lot more money from private functions.

Be wary when booking here as they have these functions from thu to sun.

Be wary of the rooms in the new wing, our room 070 at the delivery bay. Also the rooms have very poor soundproofing, constantly hear fire doors slamming during the night. I heard several other guests complain about the noise levels also.

And if you do have a genuine complaint the staff won’t want to know.

The rooms are okay, very steep stairs to the bed mezzanine which didn’t trouble us but may be an issue for others. 

If it hadn’t been for the noise and the terrible attitude of the staff then we would have probably had a lovely time. This ruined things for us which was a trip for 20th wedding anniversary.

100,Not worthy of 4 stars - open bathroom ,"The staff were nice and helpful, but the hotel didn't quite live up to our expectations. Our biggest issue was with the bathroom, which had see-through glass for walls! Little privacy. Also the tiles were very cold, and the room was a little dusty. ",3,2017,12,05
100,"Enjoy architecture, interior and holly feeling.","If you appreciate interior and special feeling, its hotel is for you. I have been in prison hotel in Helsinki, the church hotel have the same kind of wow effect. All details are in their places. Big conference room situated in former church and have the name “Chapel”. Comfortable and enjoyable.",5,2017,11,28
100,Excellent stay - wish I could have been there longer,"I stayed at Hotel Arena for one night on a business trip and wish I could have had longer to enjoy this lovely hotel. My room was clean, stylish and well appointed with kettle and coffee. Breakfast was very good with a good range of hot and cold choices. Staff were helpful and friendly throughout. Next time I will stay longer!",5,2017,11,28
100,Very disappointing,"- very devoured interior
- room temp to hot to sleep
- sheets washed with chemical that cause rash
- dirty floor
- empty bar. 
- personnel are all trainees who are still making many mistakes and lack customer empathy
- restaurant is bad price/ quality. For every main dish you need to order side dishes to have a descent meal. 
- breakfast is fine.
- old tv's in the rooms with snowy reception",1,2017,11,22
100,Such a cute hotel! ,"Me and my partner stayed here recently, 19th - 21st November for our anniversary. We arrived earlier then the check-in time so we were not able to go to the room which was no problem as we could leave our hand luggage in the lockers. 

It's not very far from the centre, about a 20 minute walk or 10 minute taxi drive. 

They also upgraded us to the loft which we loved! We loved the 2 separate floors and the bathroom was lovely too. 

I cannot complain about the hotel what so ever, as everything was perfect! Reception also kindly gave me some plasters 😌",5,2017,11,22
100,Enjoyable stay,"Arrived early but the staff were very helpful and checked me in right away (09:00).  My room was up in the loft; clean and airy. Nice king size bed and a huge shower - no bath though. Best night’s sleep I’ve had in a hotel in many years. 

Breakfast was very good every morning and I had a lovely snack one evening in front of the wonderful fireplace.

Some thoughts on why I didn’t give 5 stars - If it’s raining you get soaked through walking in from the road through the park. The stairs in front of the hotel are lethal; uneven and slippery. Although there is lots of hanging space in the closet there are no drawers and just a very high shelf. You have to get down on the floor to use the safe.

That said, this is small stuff considering the positives. The best of which is the very classy staff.

100,"Emergency trip, staff went above and beyond","Had to travel to Amsterdam last minute due to a family emergency, was able to get a room at Hotel Arena and check in at 7am when my flight arrived. Due to the nature of the emergency, I was unsure of how long my stay would be however the hotel manager Alexander was incredible. They booked me for a week at a time and waived any cancellation fee should I be able to leave sooner and provided a discounted rate. There was a large conference occurring in Amsterdam while I was there and they let me know that the hotel was booked up for that time period but should any cancellations occur they would let me know. The service from the staff was incredible, totally above and beyond any possible expectations. As for the hotel itself it was incredible, great location, modern rooms with the historic feel to the rest of the building. The park the hotel opens up on to was beautiful, and it is less than a 15 minute walk to get to the main city square. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be returning on future trips to Amsterdam.",5,2017,11,14
100,"Hotel Arena, Amsterdam","Just returned from a 3night (2 day) stay in the Hotel Arena. The hotel is about a half an hour to three quarter hour walk from city centre. The hotel main steps are lethal, all uneven and on a dark autumn night when the lighting is bad it is very dangerous.  There is a free digital safe in the room but on the floor in the wardrobe, impossible to use for many pensioners or people with disabilities as you have to sit on the floor to use.  Our room was a standard double but the ensuite is separated from the sleeping area by a smoked glass window so there is no real privacy when using the loo.  The restaurant staff were friendly and very helpful, but some of the reception staff could do with more training.  We used the hotel shuttle bus service to and from the Schiphol Airport which was good value (€28 pp return).",2,2017,11,12
100,Beautiful hotel with a fab history,"Had a lovely 2 nights stay here, the bed was the most comfy bed I’ve ever slept in and it was huge, beautiful room, one thing I will say is our fridge still had the last guests old food inside. 
Great room service, I asked for toothbrushes and they were brought up immediately. Lovely staff, very nice lad who checked us in and he also was more than happy to open the chapel for us to have a look, the hotels grounds are amazing! 45 min walk to central. Supermarket near by plus tram station. Do some historical research it was a former institution and orphanage. 
Thank you for a lovely weekend hotel Arena",4,2017,11,10
100,Emergency Decadence!,"My office put me in a nearby ‘high end’ hostel style hostel... sadly after two nights of no sleep, students running around in corridors and disruption through paper thin walls, it was time to move... and am I glad I did! The Arena was literally a stones throw away and a different world, the hotel itself, contemporary and clean with a stylish use of the building’s original purpose.

The room, at the top of the building was a quirky loft style, smaller room... or so i thought until I saw the bathroom! As a lover of a long hot soak after a day of work I can honestly say it was the best sight that I could have asked for when arriving! The corner bath was huge, the rain style shower was hot and plentiful, the bathroom decor, decedent and elegant! 

The bed was incredibly comfortable, the hotel and surround areas was quiet. TV, plenty of towels, small kettle, iron and safe, as well as spa slippers and toiletries just made it all the more enjoyable. Slept wonderfully for the rest of my trip!

The Park restaurant itself is again lovely, spacious, lit nicely for a quiet cosy dining experience, there’s also a roaring trendy fire to sit near if you’re lucky to grab a seat nearby. The menu isn’t vast but has some
Wonderful dishes, and not very expensive compared to many similar venues. The staff were courteous, friendly and I didn’t feel rushed in any way. Overall a wonderful stay following a few days of discomfort elsewhere. Will be planning another trip to Amsterdam soon for fun and will most definitely be choosing the Arena! Thank you!",5,2017,11,08
100,Nice,"It was not a splendid hotel with tons of amenities or history. 
I booked the Park King. It did face the park but the Restaurant was between it so it was more of a Roof View than a  Park View. The King bed was nice and big BUT, the room was separated in two floors and the stairs are very narrow, me a health 6'' tall man with size 12.5 shoes had some struggle going up and down. and Upstairs looked a bit boring. The largest wall on the floor (bedroom) was empty, the TV was small and I managed to brake it or change the settings meaning that someone had to come, and besides repair a lamp and change some lightbulbs.

The Bathroom was nice but the shower was awkward as it changed strength of the water when changing the water temperature (if it goes hot, the water changed pressure twice at least) and the pressure was in the end not very strong at all. The bathroom was surrounded by milk-glass meaning that you can't see through but you can see the silhouette. The bathroom's door was not closing fully so there was a gap between the door and the wall.

The Hotel decoration was lovely, breakfast in the hotel was not tried out, besides the coffee which was good. The Hotel also features a courtyard which was empty all the time and welcomed smokers like me.

The surroundings, metro 8 mins away but only 3 stations away from Centraal, tram which actually drives you inside the city centre around 10 mins walk and 10-15 minutes drive.
The park was lovely.

Staff: during check in there were a few people in front of us and they were all sent away as rooms are ready at three, same for my room and same for all other people I encountered at the desk so be prepared to come later or to store your stuff in the very large and handy and free lockers in the hotel. 
My front desk lady was ok but I loved the one next to her on the other desk which asked her guests how the trip has been so far and if they found the hotel easily (basic but nice), whereas ours did not ask us anything (she was not angry or so just OK and did what she had to do). One guy, I saw him at the front door welcoming guests was lovely.

Hotel was clean but our room had carpeted floor around the bed...

All in all a rather bad 5 star hotel meaning that it is a good 4 star hotel, what it actually is. I would come back but for a short city trip like mine, it was a bit too away from the splendid canals and houses of Amsterdam.",4,2017,11,06
100,Very interesting architecture and history,"Lovely boutique hotel at Oosterpark. There are about 135 rooms and most are unique, some are two story. Apparently the building used to be a church and some of the architecture was retained. Staff was very friendly. Restaurant/bar is very nice. Comfortable bed, feather pillows and comforter. ",5,2017,11,04
100,best hotel iv stayed at,it was a short walk from the center but its situated in a lovely park. when we first arrived there was  mix up with the room and they quickly rectified it no problems. the dining hall where we sat for breakfast every morning was absolutely beautiful it was like sitting in the park for breakfast with a glass wall facing onto park breakfast was really nice aswell no faulting the place,5,2017,11,03
100,Great Hotel,"I traveled to Amsterdam with a group of friends back in April and we really, really enjoyed our stay.  The staff was great, the room was great, the restaurant was great.  I liked that it was next to a nice park and a short walk to the tram.  I would like to visit again.",4,2017,11,01
100,Unique,"We absolutely loved this hotel. Everything about is unique and different, with a great feel and stylish too. We loved the rooms and its location is beautiful, right on the edge of a park. Only a short tram journey to the city centre, and the tram stop only a couple of minutes walk away. Very friendly and helpful staff. My only negative is that after two ni9ghts stay the toilet roll was not replenished so we actually ran out on the last morning, but other than that it was perfect. We had a duplex room and it was great",5,2017,10,25
100,Lovely,"Stayed here over a year ago whilst there were building works, we were given 1 drink voucher due to inconvenience, to be honest the building work did not bother us. 2 Minute walk from a tramline. Half an hour walk from the Heineken Experience.",5,2017,10,24
100,Style over substance,"My partner and I had high hopes of the hotel, despite some wavering reviews. We stayed for two nights in October and whilst the bar and restaurant were fantastic, the hotel certainly doesn't live up to it's 4 star rating or price.

Location is excellent, easy to get to from tram number 9 and a nice walk through a lovely park to get there. The building is quirky and has a modern feel whilst retaining some character of the original building. 

It was very busy the weekend we stayed - we were allocated the wrong room - we had paid for a more expensive room, thankfully a trip to reception sorted that out but if we hadn't said anything then I worry this would not have been corrected.

The room was ok, as in previous reviews, not dirty but a little tired, makeup on the curtains, stains on the walls and signs that it was well worn. The TV's were not working properly and when they did, there was poor reception, TV/Coffee facilities were basic, there was no mini-bar and shampoo/shower gel was the fixed to the wall type that you would get in a budget hotel. It's simply not what I would expect from a 4* rated hotel.

We could, however, live with those problems, we didn't come to watch TV and stay in the room for any period of time but, the main problem was the slamming of the door that led into our corridor. Great that is was secure and required key code access BUT, it was so heavily sprung that when it closed it literally slammed with such force that it shook our room and we were a good 5-6 rooms away from it.

This happened all through the night with guests leaving and entering the corridor to get to their rooms, it was so loud, it woke us both up on several occasions. We mentioned it to reception the following morning and were told they would look at it, nothing was done. The second night was the same, crashing and banging until 4am. It really did put a dampener on our stay, we were offered 2 complimentary hot drinks as an apology after we mentioned it again on departure but surely it is something that could have easily been fixed, we even noticed that one of the other corridors had wedged a similar door permanently open - maybe suffering the same problems.

Even putting up a simple sign would have potentially helped a little. So be careful if booking rooms 20-30 (I think), these are the ones in the corridor when we stayed.

The staff were helpful at all times, but I feel the management/owners need to take a little more care to really deserve a 4* rating. Spend a little refurbishing some rooms and update certain elements. When you are spending almost £400 for two nights you'd expect better.

We didn't have breakfast but as I mentioned, and have reviewed separately, the Park bar/restaurant is fantastic, so even if you don't stay at the hotel, do visit to enjoy the surrounding park and excellent food and drinks served, non-guest are welcome.",3,2017,10,23
100,Lovely to be back & see the changes,"I last stayed at the Hotel Arena about 10 years ago (this was my 3rd visit) & I have mixed feelings about the changes, although mostly positive. Having to now enter it through the park is good; I never walked around the park on previous visits & that's a shame because it's very pretty & restful. The new terrace & bar/dining area are great. I enjoyed sitting on the terrace, admiring the view of the park & watching children playing in the fountain or joggers & cyclists going past. The only renovation I didn't like was the reception area where the old one used to be. I felt that it had much more character before. My room was fine, especially once the A/C was fixed & it wasn't as uncomfortably hot as it had been. Great shower & comfortable beds (but not pillows). The staff were all fantastic - friendly & helpful & any small issues were soon resolved. The food in the restaurant was fantastic & I have written a separate review about that. Another improvement is the tea & coffee-making facilities in the room; they weren't there on previous visits. I'm happy that I chose this hotel again & would stay again.",5,2017,10,20
100,Artistically renovated hotel in a park,"The hotel is converted from a large old building located in a public park inside Amsterdam city. There are large split level rooms with good bed and good shower. The restaurant and the staff team were excellent. Good meeting facilities faces the park. Outstanding value for what is offered.

100,Amazing modern hotel & amazing staff,"Me and my husband were currently on our honeymoon and were looking for an affordable,cool hotel. Then we came upon hotel arena ! From the second we got there and checked in the staff was amazing. We told them we were on our honeymoon and then later in the day champagne and balloons and the cutest note were delivered to our room :) What a great end to our honeymoon. The room was amazing and modern, looked onto the park which was so beautiful. Ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel 2 times. Delicious food but the staff was a little slow. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2017,10,16
100,Stunning hotel,"Absolutely gorgeous renovation within a park. Hotel room was a lovely maisonette kept very clean by housekeeping. 

I would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Amsterdam. It is only 15 minutes on the train or tram to the city centre. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. ",5,2017,10,15
100,Lovely hotel with tram station very close,"On arrival at this hotel last week we had been given a free upgrade meaning we were staying in “The Loft”. This was a stunning room with a private balcony overlooking the Park. Toiletries / hair dryer / robes / slippers were provided.

The hotel isn’t central but there are 2 trams stops with a 3 minute walk from the hotel. It is then a 5 minute tram journey to the centre of Amsterdam.

The hotel has a lovely bar / restaurant area and all staff were really friendly and polite at all times.

Will definitely be returning :-) 

",5,2017,10,11
100,Beautiful hotel but an unexpectedly average experience,"It's a very beautiful setting, and an enormous hotel, but I didn't find the hotel itself all that comfortable. When we first arrived we'd been 'upgraded' to a chilly-looking minimalist room with a dangerous staircase in it (steep, narrow, open wooden stairs, no handrail) which you needed to climb to get to the loft bedroom. I really wasn't happy about the staircase and I imagine anyone a bit nervous about heights (and general safety) wouldn't be either. And we were looking out onto a road rather than the courtyard we'd thought we would look out on. Little things, like there being nothing in the minibar and there being a weird window in the bathroom so that anyone in the living room bit could see you in there, weren't great. We were able to change our room for the next night, and the staff were very nice about it, which was good. The new room had a very small window but was more comfy. (Except for being woken up at 2 in the morning by someone doing some kind of really loud stomping exercise routine in the room above. Sigh. And then some prankster ringing our doorbell.) But yeah. Apart from all that, it was OK!",3,2017,10,10
100,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The hotel is well situated to get to the center of Amsterdam without being too close and suffering road noise. It only takes about 30 minutes to walk to the center although there are tram stops close by if you want to catch the tram. Oosterpark is on the doorstep of the hotel so you can start your day off with a leisurely walk around the park. There are plenty of restaurants close by if you want to eat out, although the hotel restaurant offers excellent food. The staff were fantastic, helpful and polite.",5,2017,10,08
100,Wow what a location downtown Amsterdam.,"The average tourist wants a cheap stay downtown Amsterdam. Arena Hotel on the other hand is worth staying just for the hotel. What a beautiful building professionally renovated and serviced by a international staff. Wow what a beautiful hotel inside and out. You feel royal just walking the hallways. Great rooms, good restaurant, next to a beautiful park. This thing is a treat for special occasions!!!",5,2017,10,05
100,Very interesting decoration and good location,"We enjoyed the interesting decor of this hotel. This old church has been renovated in a modern and creative way.
We also liked the location, it is set by a large park and is a short tram ride away from the city centre. 
Our room was light and very airy. Clean and comfortable large bed.",5,2017,10,04
100,Excellent Hotel and Location,"We arrived at 9am after a 30hour flight from Australia and we didn't expect to get into the room, but the young lady on reception could see how tired we where and got us into the room straight away...what a welcome relief that was...refreshed and ready to hit the streets! we walked out front of the Hotel which overlooked Oosterpark, and what a view that is.... it is a little out of town, but that suited us perfectly, very easy to get around the tram is not far, a nice walk thru the park each day to get there.  The wi-fi is exceptional, and the service and room was great...a bit weird that the bathroom is all glass...not much privacy but who cares when you are on holidays. Would defiantly say here again..",5,2017,10,03
100,Pretty view to oosterpark,"I have stayed at the arena in April 2015 when the hotel refurbishment was starting. To be honest, I don't think there was any major change to the rooms, but the reception does look stunning now. They also changed the entrance of the hotel to face the park! So u can have a coffee with a splendid view!",5,2017,10,01
100,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights on work.  This was my first visit to Amsterdam. And hadn't really searched on hotels much since the office travel agent had done the booking.  This hotel is truly ""Not "" a hotel in the sense of location nor layout-- it's actually inside oosterpark- a very big park /garden in Amsterdam and the layout is veg different and unlike the standard hotels. I reached early at 8am and hence they didn't have the room ready.  However, they told me it would be ready by 1130 and it was, at the informed time. Before that, they offered me a complimentary cup of coffee at the breakfast area, which was much needed after  log flight.  Since I had 3 hours to spend, I took a walk in the oosterpark inside which this hotel is located. Being a warm sunny Sunday, it was absolutely lovely to see the park being filled with people running, walking, cycling and doing yoga. It was quite n serene. In another section of the park, boys were playing football. There is a fountain, some statues etc made it lovely.  There is a LPQ restaurant on the other exit of the park where I had my breakfast, which was also suggested by the hotel(loved it). Once I checked in, found a room which was a bit smallish but with God amenities. Really had a high ceiling. The hotel has its own charm n character And not commoditized.  The restaurant is very popular with park goers as well. There was a nice fire lit over there in evening. Staff is friendly even at breakfast. I really would have loved some veg hot dishes at bfast but was pretty ok though. They don't serve hot omelettes though in the breakfast. There is a huge kids play area in the park which is right next to the hotel. One actually enters the hotel by entering the park. 
 The hotel is a good 10-15min walk to nearest metro station. It takes around 30min from airport in the airport cab which costs around 50-55 euros. Took an uber which took around 35euros- which are easily available at the airport. In all, loved this hotel for its location n interiors n smiling staff.  Small niggles are there but totally worth it.

Highly recommended.

100,Lovely break,"We booked a 2 night break with lastminute.com, flights with easyJet & staying at Hotel Arena. Such a big and beautiful hotel, loads of character. Comfortable beds and good wifi. 
Our friends from the US booked to stay too. The dinner we shared in the hotel's restaurant was fantastic, good value for fine food. 
The staff were always friendly and helpful. It was brilliant to be able leave our suitcases in the lockers after check out. 
The park is a bonus too, really lovely. ",5,2017,09,24
100,Worst service ever,"Booked a room with garden for a very special occasion, the night of my wedding.
On arriving we were informed the booked room was not available and the alternative room was not decorated as specifically requested by friends of the just married couple.
There was nothing they could do on the night itself so we left.
The next morning we received a half hearted apology by phone and promise the deposit for the room would be returned.
Despite the fact that we clearly stated this was a once in a lifetime moment there was no attempt to compensate us in any way!!
This is one of the worst customer experiences I have ever encountered!",1,2017,09,24
100,Not very nice or very clean rooms,"When I walked into the hotel I was impressed by the design and set up, the lobby and restaurant are lovely. However, when I got to my room the standards dropped significantly. The room was not really clean, their were hairs left in the bathroom and sink was not clean. Also, I stayed at the hotel for two nights and they did not really clean the room during the day. When I got back to my room on the second evening they had put down a clean towel but that was it they didn't clean up the dirty dishes or anything else... I travel a lot for work and this was one of the least clean experiences I have had at hotel.

The other down side is that my room was near the door to the hall way and all night both I could hear the door slamming as people came and went. I would really recommend to the hotel that if they are going to have doors on the hallway that they try to make them a bit quieter. All you would need to do is a put a spring loaded hinge on the door. Even through earplugs I got woken up a lot.

It's too bad that the rooms aren't nicer because the common spaces in the hotel really are lovely and the hotel is in a very nice location. 

I come to Amsterdam a fair amount for work but I won't be staying here again.",2,2017,09,21
100,"Quirky, charming, different and inconsistent ...","Quirky, charming, different and inconsistent ... that's how I would describe Hotel Arena. 

The hotel certainly benefited from its recent renovation (the 'reopening' was apparently only one month ago). The rooms are relatively large and the bathrooms stylish and beautiful!

But there were numerous reasons not to give the maximum score. A few examples: the hallways were relatively dirty (do they have a vacuum cleaner?), the television didn't work properly and they do not have proper coffee machines in the room (only hot water coolers with Nescafé).  

All-in-all a good choice when in Amsterdam!",4,2017,09,21
100,Not impressed,"I arrived to check in to a room which was pre paid by my partner who arrived with our bags during the day. He had a work meeting so I arrived at the hotel later without him. He told me all was in order and I would just need to give his name and let them know our bags were in locker 15 and I could get them and have access to the room. From the start, I was treated like a criminal! Had to describe the bag in the locker before it was given to me, was rudely asked to pay the city tax immediately and after suspicious looks and questions was finally given the key. I was surprised that there was no offer to have the bags delivered to the room so after lugging a suitcase up the stairs, myself, I was most annoyed to find that the room key did not work. Reluctantly, I found my way back at reception with the same woman at concierge surprised that it did not work. Finally, it was swiped again or reloaded and I was able to get inside the room. After a shower, I was even more surprised to find a STRANGE man enter the room with his own key! Probably the most frightening and horrible thing a woman can experience after a shower and wearing a towel. There is no milk or bottled water, no room service menu or any kind of guest book/ information manual lying around that I can see. Although the room is clean, tidy and modern, my experience has been more like a 2-3 star hotel based on the rude service and incompetency of the front desk. Won't be staying here again. What a shame as I was so looking forward to a fun night out in Amsterdam. ",1,2017,09,20
100,Unbeleavable location immersed in nature yet central location,"An unbelievable marriage between the original Amsterdam orphanage architecture and the clean cut lines of aluminum and glass. This great hotel is located in one of the most beautiful parks in downtown Amsterdam. Not only do you have the amenities of the hotel you have a lush green park with  water features, duck ponds, a very cool kiddie park, tennis courts, bike rentals, gardens everywhere and large park areas. We were able to catch some great music in one of the park gazebos. There's a great coffee shop just on the other side of the park and ATM's. The Hotel had a brand new dinning and eating area with a huge deck looking on to the park and fountains. Food was a 7 out of 10 but the breakfast was great with all types of pastries, dairy products juices sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, etc. Inside you can see that they are still tweaking final touches after extensive remodeling. Their challenge and their success was keeping historic architectural features with modern amenities and remodeled guestrooms. Oh and beds were quite comfortable and bathrooms modern but not large (I'm 6'4""). All in all, truly a great stay!",5,2017,09,19
100,Serene Park Setting,"The hotel has many amazing qualities, the top of my list was the location. Situated in a lovely park with unusually warm summer weather in Amsterdam, we spent many hours at the hotel's outdoor restaurant/bar patio with views on the park. The staff was extremely friendly. In the evening, when it became chilly, the toasty heaters turned on making night dining very pleasant. The cuisine was tasty and on point with some great wine selections. The modern architectural elements combined with the old world structures offers a historic, spacious and dynamic feel. The hotel offers a very refined bohemian artist feel, and as an artist myself I felt very at home!  I would love to throw an event in their converted Church space and hold meetings in their conference rooms. There is also a focus on showcasing art on the expansive wall spaces through out the hotel.
The rooms were clean and newly renovated. Simple chic and very comfortable. On this trip, I stayed for 4 nights in the beginning of the week and when I flew back home, I decided to stay a night for layover. The hotel is a very short trip to the airport, I reserved a taxi at the front desk and in 5 minutes a driver came up to the hotel to escort me to his car. I would 100% stay at Hotel Arena again and highly recommend it to my friends. See you soon Amsterdam! XXX",5,2017,09,19
100,Top-to-bottom brilliant makeover,"We stayed in the hotel a week ago and the spot captured our attention. Its central location and the picture of the Oosterpark in the surrounding is just fascinating.This hotel refreshed its rooms, restaurant and interior with surprising sleek and modern results. It also upgraded in-room amenities such as small Dutch touches. Next up the restaurant redesign including a ""herb and planting garden"" providing the chefs work with fresh ingredients. We just LOVED IT! The staff was very attentive and impeccable. 

The hotel Arena certainly hints that improvements will only get better at this charming Amsterdam's spot.",5,2017,09,19
100,Location location location,"Firstly, although the location is fantastic, and beautiful i have to say that the staff are what makes it even better. Thomas from the front desk was so lovely, and made us feel welcome, he is a star! We had a small issue and it was fixed within 20mins by him, i didnt feel like i was wrong to complain either, i was treated very nicely. The hotel has a resdruant and it is excellent, the lamb and rump were perfectly cooked, the mayo was homemade and one of my favouraite things about the chips",5,2017,09,04
100,Hotel Arena in Amsterdam,"Large and different Hotel considering the design and location of the house. Very good breakfast and restaurant! Superfine room in modern style. Spacious spaces and very nice park right outside. I highly recommend this hotel!
//Mats Samaras, Stockholm, Sweden",5,2017,08,26
100,BEAUTIFUL,"This hotel was perfect! I spent a weekend away in Amsterdam with my boyfriend and this hotel was the perfect setting. The staff were very friendly, the price is brilliant. Our room consisted of 2 floors (!!) ; a lounge area and a black tiled, modern luxurious bathroom and stairs up to a large comfy bed with a fantastic view from the huge windows. 
The hotel sits in front of a lake & is located right beside a big park, which you would walk through to get to the tram stop, where you are able to get the 15min tram to the city centre for little money. 
Although we did not eat in the restaurant hotel, it none the less looked like a lovely location to eat as well as to sit in the outside bar area.
The hotel is not only close to transport links but also supermarkets and shops. It is not too far from Amsterdam's centre- around a 25min walk through pretty streets and canals. However Amsterdam is great to travel around due to options such as the tram or cycling!
The room was spotless, cosy and I enjoyed the elegance of the hotel's design- overall not a bad word to say!

This hotel was a perfect romantic getaway. I would definitely recommend Hotel Arena- it is beautiful, quirky and convenient! ",5,2017,08,24
100,Nice city break,"The hotel was nicely decorated and all the people who worked there were very nice and professional. I liked the location of the hotel, it was a 30 minute walk to the city centre and around 15 -20 minutes to the zoo. I liked the lay out of the room and I liked the design of the bathroom. Little tip with the shower, don't turn it on too high or water will spread from the shower into other areas of the bathroom. Bad points- the room was a little dirty, particularly if you have one of the rooms with two floors as the wall coming down the stairs was yellow were everyones hands had been. Breakfast was nice however, if staying again I would get it from a nearby cafe instead.",4,2017,08,22
100,Great room in a lovely environment.,"After arriving a day late due to a flight cancelation we were pleased to be given a room upgrade. This went some way to soften our  frustration with the journey. The room was quite lovely and very unusual; set in the roof-space of a beautiful looking building with large beams serving as part of the decor and light and space an integral part of the room. An equally unusual and spacious bathroom was right through a glazed wall with deep bath, separate shower, sink and toilet all with loads of room. The rest of the building was equally special once you began to find your way through the long landings and wings. Bar and breakfast areas were lovely and welcoming, as were the staff. The hotel is on the edge of a nice park and very close to a variety of eating and drinking places if you wanted to stay local. If you wanted the city centre it was fifteen minutes by tram. This is certainly a place to which we would return as we do love Amsterdam.",4,2017,08,20
100," Cool view, good service..poor rooms","When you arrive.. you are stunned by the modern and slick aesthetic.

Staff are friendly and service swift. It must be said its not clear which reception to check in at but who cares when its this pretty.  

We started in room 127.... Filthy! So we moved.

The amazing receptionist quickly came to help and gave us the choice of rooms 270 and 224. Both much better 

We opted for room 270 as the view was amazing. The downside was again the room was sub-par. Shower broken, no water pressure in the room and faulty aircon.

As we were on a short break we didn't really have time to change again.

The restaurant was really good.. modern and impressive quality. 

The location is great if you want a quiet time and cabs are cheap. 

We  appreciate that our stay was probably an isolated incident so are unsure if we would risk staying here again as the cleanliness and useability of the rooms didn't match the price BUT the service was very good. ",3,2017,08,16
100,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed 4 nights at this beautiful hotel - located at a park outside the center of Amsterdam, but only a 15 minute bike ride from the city center (and Red Light District). Quiet surroundings, friendly staff, beautiful rooms. The food (breakfast and hotel restaurant) was overpriced and not that good, really.",4,2017,08,15
100,"Killer breakfast, great service","We just stayed 2 nights in one of the first floor rooms. I liked the design of the rooms with the indirect lighting, we had a door out to an outdoor table and a little garden which was nice when the sun came out.
Breakfast was amazing with a buffet of all sorts, from sausages, eggs, cheeses and beans, through to some fresh green health-juice, yoghurt with goji berries, and other healthy stuff. 
They have a beautiful terrace looking out onto the park that gets a lot of locals too for drinks and food. Staff were kind enough to show us the restored church on the side that they will be using for events and parties. Definitely wanna see that, it's beautiful, and has a pretty damn good looking sound system.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,15
100,Perfect for Couples on City Breaks ,"We absolutely loved Hotel Arena. It was the second stop on our trip round Europe and quite frankly we haven't stayed anywhere quite as nice since. 

We arrived at the hotel about 11:30 and didn't know if we'd be able to check in as most places these days seem to set check in at 2pm. We were delighted to find that our room was ready for us. The hotel grounds and interior is stunning and we thought we'd turned up at the wrong place at first as two interrailers surely couldn't be staying at somewhere so lovely!

The room was unique over two levels. The bed upstairs, bathroom and living area downstairs.

Everything was clean and the bed was insanely comfy and perhaps robbed us of a few extra hours exploring Dam! 

Would love to come back to Hotel Arena soon as Dam has been our favourite city in Europe. 

I must also say that we the staff were perfect. We asked a gentleman on reception about the public transport near the hotel and he was able to provide us with great info and was just really pleasant.

The lady who checked us in was able to tell us about things going on in the city that weekend and was happy to chat to us and make us feel welcome.

The same can be said of the staff in the bar / restaurant - all attentive and really lovely.

The hotel is situated in a park and there's so much going on in the park itself it's lovely to walk round.

The hotel sets you up for how lovely the people in Dam are and it really made our trip staying here!",5,2017,08,14
100,What a great surprise,"It was a long time ago since I didn't go to this hotel ( about 10 years ago), and, surprise, surprise, it has been recently completely renovated!!! 
I went with a group of friends and we all really enjoyed the staying.
I loved that they added a modern and stylish interiors to the old structure of the building.
Rooms were really big and clean, and the mattress was super confortable! I had a really nice room next to a interior garden.
Staff welcome us really well, and took care of all our requests.
They have a good variety for breakfast, and their restaurant is open for lunch and dinner too, together with their cocktail bar, which is open till late.
It is well located, close to Ooster park, for people that like to be central but still want to stay in a quiet area, away from the busiest area of the city. For a local experience, I think it is a great place to stay.",5,2017,08,14
100,See through glass door in the toilet,"Room was clean and the bed comfy. There were minor damages to the room (wall paper peeling, dent in floor, lamps not working) which were acceptable. The reason for the 2 stars: it is not very romantic, when the toilet wall & door facing the entire room is made of glass and there is a big gap between the door and the frame. To make it even worse the foil on the window was see through, so unless you like to see and listen to your partner take a leak or number two, you need to leave to room. On top of this the bath drain was clocked meaning that any bath longer than 1min would flood the entire bathroom. We could then figure out that this had happen many times as the dent in the wooden floor was just outside of the bathroom door. Can only hope that they have dried and ventilated the floor after the previous floodings to avoid fungus. 

Next time I'm in Amsterdam, I will find another hotel. ~150-200€/night with the above flaws is just not good enough.",2,2017,08,08
100,Could be a great hotel ,"The grounds of this hotel are incredible as well as the park that surrounds. Unfortunately the room let the hotel down. Brown marks on the wall beside the bed, and a shower within a foot of the toilet with no shower screen, meant that every time you had a shower the whole bathroom became drenched in water. Maybe other rooms are better? Not sure if we would be back ",3,2017,08,08
100,"Dirty rooms, leaking roof, beautiful surroundings","Upon arrival was given a different room than booked (regular double instead of duplex). The room was comfy and bright but the floor was dirty, shower drain clogged, and the roof leaked after it rained. I liked the white decor but the white furniture was in dire need of a solid cleanup. Doors of other rooms closed rather noisily and the air conditioning also made noise, as did the pipes - I sure knew when my neighbors were taking their showers! The whole second floor looked rather shabby, in contrast to the public areas of the hotel which are very pleasant.

On the upside, the café was very nice, with a pleasant park view and the hotel was located a short walk from a tram or metro stop.",2,2017,08,04
100,Gorgeous hotel ,My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and we  loved it. It's a little outside of the busy center which was perfect for us. It was quiet and we were able to get good nights rest! The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and is in a great park setting. We had a large room with a king size bed and a soaker tub. The staff is super friendly and made our stay very comfortable. We will definitely be back! ,5,2017,08,03
100,"Fantastic, affordable, funky cool hotel!","Loved the historical aspect, the park location, the amazing bar/restaurant, and all of the quirky-ness of this place. I felt like a local while being treated like a special guest. I am hoping that this hidden gem stays as such so I can afford it the next time I go to Amsterdam! Pro-tip: The white sangria imagined by bar manager Dior is to die for. The breakfast buffet is worth starving yourself the night before for...",5,2017,08,02
100,Beautiful Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed for four nights from the 25th to the 29th of July 2017. 
Walking up to the hotel, I was amazed at how beautiful it was. The mix of old and new is stunning. Walking through into the hotel lobby, the place was full of character.
We were originally worried about what type of room we would get as we had accidentally booked a twin room instead of double but we emailed the hotel a week before our stay to ask if there was any chance of changing this and we were delighted that they were able to accommodate us with a double room at no extra charge!  The room was very interesting as it had the bathroom and seating area when you come in and a small stairs up to the double bed above you, which I found very quirky. Although, I did find the stairs quite steep and it made me nervous to walk down (especially at night) and also the bathroom walls were see through glass which was not really to my liking but I still loved everything! 
The hotel was a five minute walk to a tram that would take you to the centre of Amsterdam in no time, or you could walk and it would take roughly 15 to 20 minutes to walk, which was no issue to us as the surrounding area is beautiful and peaceful. (Do be mindful of bikes though!)
Altogether, it was a wonderful hotel and a fantastic trip! Will definitely be back!",5,2017,08,01
100,Beautiful hotel and great staff,"We were blown away by the responsiveness of the staff here. They truly do care about their guests. 

The hotel is also very beautiful and has comfortable beds.  Ita a beautifuly restored ristoric building that blends in modern touches through out.

The hotels GM Dino and Front Office Supervisor Daniel, made an impression on us. They went above and beyond to respond to our requests that they had no obligation to do.

I would highly recommend staying here and my wife and i will be coming back on our next visit to Amsterdam.",5,2017,07,31
100," Very nice placd","Great place, not too far from city centre! Nice hotel, rooms are different! I'll try to get one story room next time! Will visit again! Breakfast is nice too!
Will go again! The actual hotel is bigger than what I was expecting!",4,2017,07,31
100,ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,"Stayed for four nights in mid-July. Overall enjoyed a decent trip to Amsterdam however the hotel proved to be the ""blot"" of the trip.

We arrived at around 1:30 in the afternoon to be told check in wasn't until 3pm so we left luggage in the lockers provided and headed out. Upon arrival back at 3, we were told one of our two rooms would be ready shortly and the second may take longer. The receptionist then headed off to check with the housekeeping as to when the rooms would be ready. Around 15 minutes later she headed off with her coat and bag as if she was heading home without any word or update to when the room would be ready. We eventually got the keys at 5pm. 

A plus point for the hotel is we had requested rooms close together and we were across the corridor from each other, so this was executed as requested.

In my room the safe was broken. In both of the rooms my family occupied there were non of the usual instructions on how to use the television or telephone. There were tea and coffee making facilities as promised however absolutely no milk or anything in the fridge (even some UHT cartons would suffice, just to get you started) plus the placement of the kettle meant the lead didn't actually reach the nearest plug. 

Housekeeping itself seemed to be, literally, a days work. There were times you still saw the housekeeping staff going around at 5pm and what ""cleaning"" actually took place was questionable. It seemed all that was done was change of the towels, cups, emptying the bin and straightening the bedsheets. Unlike many of other places we have stayed, there didn't appear to be any cleaning done in the bathroom or floor, no bleach smell or anything to suggest things had been scrubbed- thankfully we had our own cleaning wipes to go round and give things the once over. I would hope that these things get properly cleaned during the changeover, however having not had these cleaned during our stay, possibly not.... Maybe this could be as we had standard rooms and the costlier, plusher rooms get priority? 

The were grubby marks on the wall of the staircase leading up to the bed. There was one occasion where I hung the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, only for the housekeeping lady to come barging in regardless, turn all the lights on and then seem shocked I was there. 

Do not leave your ""spare"" room key in the power supply for easy use as we had done as the cleaners had a habit of removing them. This meant a trip to reception to get another set. 

The rooms, despite the need for a decent deep clean and maybe a lick of paint, did the job and were sufficient for what we used them for.

We felt there was a lack of coordination and trust between the hotel and ""The Park"" restaurant/bar despite being told both were the same company. Whilst we had not prebooked for breakfast, we chose to eat there on two mornings. Breakfast cost €19.50 (or €17.50 if booked through reception the day before). For the cost, the choice on offer wasn't value for money and there was a feeling of making things stretch throughout - I never felt there would be replenishments being brought out quickly once something had run out. The staff though were incredibly quick to remove dirty cups and plates from the table. Perhaps they thought this was being efficient, however we felt pressured and unable to enjoy our food without somebody hovering waiting for you to finish so they could clean up. On the first morning we had breakfast and were presented with the bill literally as we found a table - so without having even eaten, already expected to cough up. Maybe the staff don't trust the customers?

Location wise, it is nicely just out of the way from the main city centre - it took us around 20/25 minutes walk or the nearest metro station is five minutes around the corner. The park itself is nice however there did seem to be a few undesirable characters lurking in the corners. 

All in all there is room for improvement however having said that, certain members of staff were obliging.",3,2017,07,28
100,Wow! What a Beaut of a hotel!,"Perfectly located and an excellent introduction to the relaxed Amsterdam way. The hotel's appearance is captivating from the moment you arrive and then we were lucky enough to be greeted by the lovely smiley Lisa on reception. Our room was beautiful (we were even fortunate enough to get an upgrade as we were on our honeymoon). I have seen people comment about bathrooms with little privacy - it is right to say that in certain lights you might get an eyeful so sharing with a work colleague for example might be a tad awkward but didn't bother us - not sure all rooms are like this tho. The terrace/bar/restaurant/rooms are even more stunning than the photos show. Staff were a joy generally - helpful, chatty and welcoming. We even got to have a look at the chapel. Food was super, and the cocktails were really rather good too. If you fancy staying in a laid back neighbourhood a stones throw away from central Amsterdam but with its own trendy cafes and vibe, Oosterpark is ideal. 

Only pernickety grumble - it's really no worse than this - was a screechy bathroom door (just ill fitting so caused a noise when my husband or I used the loo in the night!).  

Do go! ",5,2017,07,28
100,Not so great experience,"I made my booking via booking com. we stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July. 
upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. it turned out that this was not the room we booked - i had specially reserved the 2 level ""duplex"" room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings. The room itself was ok, if you don't mind the broken window that can not be closed (hello rain) and a mini-fridge that contained some sort of a bio-weapon (at least i guessed so by the smell of it) I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex  (btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the  high ceiling )  was offered a room but only the next day.
SO, i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to. Not the best way to begin your holiday. so we had to wait till 13-00 in order to check in my new room. what a wonderful waist of my time...
The room (#023) i got was just as i wanted to - peaceful internal garden view, big window.  We were tired from waiting the room so we  placed our belongings and rushed to the city. In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room - i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something..  it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am, making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife. I have an audio recording that i can not attach here, but if you want i can send it via e-mail. The next day the technician came but  was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so, i was offered to change the room once again. the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left - the one that was smaller but seems newer. the problem is - it was just outside the restaurant and it was not so relaxing as i planned.  As it was already a late evening i decided to drink myself to sleep and deal with the problem later. The next day even this option disappeared so i was left with my problem. No complimentary things were offered to me for such an experience, no one checked on me or tried to fix the problem later (may i remind you - my wonderful experience here was for 6 nights in a row, not that short time to get neglected). May be i should have made a dramatic scene right in front of the lobby and demand my money back BUT as long as we were not planing to spend too much time indoors i was thinking it was not such a big deal and it won't screw my remaining vacation, as i was hoping the problem would be solved.
we loved the park with a small pond that is just outside the hotel. the more wise thing for us to do would be to buy a tent and go sleep in a park.
i would have understood if it was a B&B or a hostel...  but you should pay 170 Eur for a night to have a chance to book a room here.
My advice - stay away or be prepared to deal with the problems of an old remodeled building by yourself.",1,2017,07,24
100,Nice quiet hotel,"We had the room with terrace - is really recommendable. Only negative point: roomservice is only until 11:30 pm. Friendly staff, public transport are easily accessible. Parking garage is directly under the hotel, is with EUR 30 unfortunately not quite cheap.",5,2017,07,24
100,Quiet nights,"If you are a regular visitor to Amsterdam or are handy with a smart phone this is for you. It is about half an hour walk from the train station. Or get a tram. 

If you are a smoker of the herbal kind there are coffee shops near by but not as regular as you would closer in to the city. 

This was the first time I have been in this hotel and at the time it was getting refurbished. Excellent could hardly tell there was workmen in the building. 

Or if you fancy a little walk the arena hotel is situated in the beautiful oosterpark ",5,2017,07,23
100,Great Hotel,Lovely hotel with great staff. The rooms were cleaned daily and were immaculate. Will definitely be returning. We had the most basic room and that was perfect so the upgrades must be even better. Beautiful grounds to the hotel as well with optional extras of renting bikes,5,2017,07,22
100,Nice hotel,I stayed here 1 night with my family. I would say the overall setting of the hotel is lovely. Really grand looking and great decor. The staff were friendly. Our room wasn't ready on time so we got a free drink at the bar. Our room was nice; it was a bit shabby in places though. There were 2 dead fly squashed to the wall and the side walls had scuff marks etc. Part of the wall was peeling. It was very clean just a bit shabby though. I would say the hotel should make use of the side entrances this would make for a much quicker journey to the tram stop!! The doors are there so let your customers use them. It's a 5-10 min walk to the tram stop and a 12 min tram too town which is nice enough. You can get the number 9 tram from centraal/dam sq and get off at alexandraplien (the stop after the zoo),4,2017,07,22
100,Nice hotel next to a beautiful park,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend. The hotel is ideal for couples, cosy setting and calm arena. The city centre is not for away, 20-25 minutes walking distance.
Nice room but the floor wasn't cleaned under the bed but for the rest it was perfect. Good and lovely breakfast. An extra asset is the parking lot under the hotel, just 30 EUR a day which is reasonnable.",4,2017,07,17
100,Beautiful hotel with good service,"Our initial encounter with this hotel was not what we had hoped for since they couldn't find our booking (we had booked through Secret Escapes). It sorted itself out and we got a normal sized room for two. We had however booked a larger room, which we got the following day. The staff was very helpful so there was nothing to complain about. 

The hotel itself is absolutely fantastic, very large and with nice, clean, spacious rooms. The larger room we got was situated on the top floor, maybe in what had once been the attic, with exposed beams. The bathroom was exceptionally large with a shower and a bathtub.

Now on to the breakfast buffet: Amazing. A wide selection of food, very fresh and nicely presented. A lot of staff who made sure there was plenty of everything. We never tried the restaurant for dinner, but the bar offers some very nice cocktails.

Would I recommend this hotel? Definitely. It won't be the cheapest option but in my opinion worth the extra money.",5,2017,07,17
100,Fantastic hotel ,Lovely hotel. Fantastic view over the wonderful park. Lovely atmosphere and very polite and friendly staff.  The room was modern and stylish. Free wifi. The restaurant serves exquisite food. The scallops are to recommend. The tram stops just outside. Close to restaurants and food stores and street markets. The train station is within walking distance. The breakfast at the hotel is fantastic! We lived our stay! Definitely coming back!,4,2017,07,16
100,Beautiful ,My husband and two friends spent 2 wonderful nights at this hotel. We had a room right at the top (300) and were amazed at how beautiful and in keeping with the original features of the hotel it was. Our friend had a double storey room (124) but we much preferred ours to theirs. The building is stunningly gothic and set within walking distance of tram stops into the centre and right inside a park. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and it was extremely reasonable in price too. Also the huge bath was amazing!! ,5,2017,07,11
100,Fabulous hotel let down by rubbish staff,"We stayed at this hotel this weekend.  When we arrived we were shocked about how lovely it was and the settings.  We went to check in and were told that check-in was not available till 3pm, it was only 2.15 so we were provided lockers for our luggage and went to the hotel bar.  

This bar/restaurant is the reason that I never gave Hotel Arena 5 stars and in all honesty I near gave only 3.  There were 6 of us and we tried to find a able without a reserved sign on and finally managed to get a 'spot'.  We asked for food and drinks menus, after 20 minutes we still have no menus so went and took some off the surrounding 'host stand'.  Then we tried for another 10 minutes to get someones attention to take our drink order.  Put it this way we had been in the bar for over 40 minutes before we had got one drink.  We even tried to go into the bar area but was told that someone would come and take  our order.  When our drinks did arrive the wine was warm, we asked for ice but once again too ages.

By this point it was around 3.50 so we decide to check into our rooms.  My key came first so up I went, have too say the room was lovely although very small (room 133), it was a twin room and the beds were very close together but for a 2 night stay it was sufficient.  Thankfully we didn't have much baggage as there wouldn't have been much room to store it but on the whole it was ok (the shower was realy lovely and powerful). The only other comment on the room was that the air con only went as low as 19 degrees, during the night it was very hot.

We went back to the bar to all regroup, one  couple still had thier suitcases with them, it was now over an hour and a half after check-in time and their room still wasn't ready, the hotel supplied them with a small beer each as compensation.  

Once the rest of our party arrived and everyone finally got to their rooms we all went out for a walk.  The next morning we went down to breakfast. This was not included in the price of the room and had a charge of around 20 euro's.  The food was sufficient, nice touch of a bottle of cava on the side patrons could pour themselves.  There was 8 of us staying at the hotel and we poured about half a glass each before it run out and we were told that there was no more in the hotel.  They only had another 'make' but we could only have a glass.  I doubt that any of us wanted more than a glass but it was the point, the other bottle was left on the side for people to take as much as they like from......  We then asked if we could book an outside table for lunch, we were going to the North Sea Jazz Festival with a driver picking us up from the hotel so didn't want to go out.  We were then told that they don't take reservations for tables outside (even though the day before tables had been covered with reserved signs'.  So I went to reception to ask if we could book an outside table and explained how the day before loads of tables had been reserved.  I was then told (after a call) that there was no problem and it was all booked.  When we went down for lunch of course it hadn't been booked.  With some rejigging of tables and chairs we all managed to sit together (not that the staff helped us with that), lunch orders were 'forgotten to be cooked', drinks were wrong, I asked for a vodka and tonic and was asked if I would like hendricks?  There is also an issue with the staff do not seem to be trained to 'think outside the box', if you have run out of one type of rose wine, please then tell us the rose you do have.  When taking drinks orders, maybe notice how many empty glasses are on the table and think of moving some away?  The people that brings your drinks are not allowed to take orders.  People who can take orders seem to spend most of the time hanging around the 'host stand' shuffling menus,  We did ask someone and was told that the waiters apart from a couple are all contract staff and we all guessed which ones were permanent straight away as they were the only decent staff working there. 

Would I stay here again?  Yes for sure but do not expect me to be trying to buy any drink or food.",4,2017,07,11
100,Hotel arena,Hotel was set in a lovely park on the outskirts of the city. It was still undergoing a huge revamp. Our room was very modern. It looked like it was one room possibly made into more than one. It had a very unique touch with a mezzanine floor above which was the lounge. The layout could have been slightly different as the bed was against the wall and window so if the person nearest the window needed to get out they had to climb over the other person. The hotel had a very modern outlook and I can imagine once the revamp is finished it will be spectacular. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment. We ate at the local bars. ,4,2017,07,09
100,Mini Break outstanding,"We arrived late on the Friday evening, but the welcome was very warm and friendly. The Room was amazing and different. The grounds of the hotel where outstanding making our mini city break breathtaking. We spent the weekend visiting various sights and alot of walking. On the Saturday night we choice to have a meal in the hotel, it was mouth watering and one of the best meals we have ever had. The lamb with salad, simple but the sauce and meat was outstanding. Highly recommended",5,2017,07,06
100,Stunning Hotel in Beautiful Location,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Hotel is beautiful, room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The room was quite an odd shape but this is due to the building having previously been an orphanage. It is about a 40 minute walk from the city centre, this is a lovely walk to do to see a bit of the city. It is based near a beautiful park. There is a tram nearby if you don't feel like walking which is very handy, Food is lovely in the hotel and staff were very helpful and gave great advice on things to see during our stay. We had access to free wifi in our room which was fantastic. Would definitely return here.",5,2017,07,04
100,Lovely hotel & staff,"We arrived at the hotel and thought it looked lovely with the park surrounding (minus the graffiti on the out building though which is a shame and made us think oh no! :( ) its a good 40 min walk from Amsterdam centraal so you definitely need to use the metro train which is really cheap or taxi $40-$60 euros which we weren't really prepared to pay! Staff were lovely, especially the tanned girl (not sure of name) as we were assigned room number 34 (avoid - too small) and it hadn't been cleaned, bed sheets messy, previous people left their card etc.. went back to reception and we were upgraded to a bigger room number 62, we loved our room, large, view of the canal, free wifi, huge bath, comfy bed and toiletries were perfect! Don't mind the lay out of the room with the bed upstairs, although steps are steep but we found this was the norm in Dam! Only thing we would of preferred in the room is sachets on milk for a cup of tea :) We had our main meal tea there both nights we stayed, small portions but lovely food! Overall enjoyed our stay, would recommend and would stay again! Thank you x",4,2017,06,30
100,Tourist in own city!,"We enjoyed a lovely romantic stay at Hotel Arena. Our modern but cosy styled room had a sky high view of the Oosterpark. After a nice dinner at the hotel restaurant we went for an evening walk in the park (which I think is one of the nicest in Amsterdam). Thanks to our ceiling high windows we woke up with the sunrise looking over the park. We enjoyed an easy breakfast, with lots of good stuff to choose from. Hotel Arena deserves a 'local recommendation', especially because it is perfectly located as there is so much going on in the neighborhood with new restaurants, bars and shops.  Hope you all enjoy your stay as much as we did!",5,2017,06,30
100,Lovely experience,"My sister and I enjoyed a very pleasant weekend at this hotel.    The staff were all excellent and very helpful,  nothing was too much trouble.  The room was clean and basic but lacked the little extras, ie tissues etc.

Limited evening meals but breakfast was varied and quite delicious.

Overall a very nice experience, thank you.
Geraldine and Rosemarie",4,2017,06,27
100,"Nice hotel, good location","Choosing a hotel in Amsterdam is really a tough task. We made a lot of searches until someone told us about the arena, even though of its high price, we had no other choice. 
Regarding the location, you have to take into account that the hotel is in the wing of a beautiful park and the hotel is very big. Having all of this in the center of amsterdam would be very difficult. Even though you have tram stations close-by. The rijkmuseum, Van Gogh museum and Heineken experience are relatively close, I would say walking distance if you like to walk the city.
Beautiful hotel, very very delicious food, you won't want to go out to eat anywhere else, the breakfast bufete was also one of the best I've had. The people where very friendly, the architecture of the public spaces is very modern and feels very nice to be there.
The bad part about the hotel is that being a remodeled old big house, which used to be an orphanage, the rooms we had have certain aspects of strange spaces that we did not like.
Our room's bathroom was a see-through glass and we where 3 people, so we had no privacy, one of the bathrooms had no toilet paper, a light was broken, we had no extra towel and no extra bed when we entered the room for the third person of our room.
Don't know other hotels in Amsterdam, but according to our investigation this could be a very good hotel if you are not on a budget.
",4,2017,06,25
100,Nice hotel,This hotel is located in an old girls orphanage right on a city park not too far from the center of town. The renovation and transformation as a hotel was exquisitely made. The beautiful bronze stair rails were kept. Rooms are very confortable and modern. The restaurant offers a great view and the food and service is pretty good. ,5,2017,06,25
100,"Uber-stylish, relaxed hotel","We stayed for four nights and found every inch of the hotel to be really well furnished; more than just clean and tidy though, feeling like a great deal of attention had been paid to every aspect. The staff were fantastic, not just friendly but really professional and diligent. 

The park literally right out the front door is divine and so relaxing and welcoming with a large kids play area and outdoor paddling pool for kids too; it's still a really quiet and peaceful park though. The cafe attached to the hotel is really nice, modern and elegant with friendly staff; it's mid range in price I'd say, so not a budget cheap place but not fine dining prices either.

To echo another review, our room wasn't quite what we'd expected; some of the photos show amazing huge rooms with beamed ceilings and what have you. Ours was reasonably compact but was still very comfy with a sofa, decent bed and lovely shower room. So, even though it wasn't quite as amazing as we'd expected, it was still very lovely!

I'd 100% recommend this hotel but it isn't the most central; me and my partner are moderately fit & active and it took us 25 minutes to get to the centre of the city each day so nothing excessive but still a (nice) walk. I know some people want to have all the landmarks right on their doorstep so if this is you, or you want to stumble back after several beers, this may not be the hotel for you. That said, the public transport and bike hire is good and the walk along the Amstel each morning was a pleasure and littered with cafes. 

Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2017,06,24
100,What a find,"Our room was amazing with super high ceilings, very modern, well appointed for such an old building. Was it really an insane asylum once upon a time? Kudos to the interior designer. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were very clean.",4,2017,06,21
100,"A grand building, but noisy while being renovated.","We got a special price, but then, they were in renovations so there was mild inconvenience.  Our first room, with the bedroom in the loft and the toilet down a steep flight of steps was really not very good, so we changed rooms.  Second room was much better.",4,2017,06,19
100,I'd stay again- but in a different room!,"I stayed at the Hotel Arena for 5 nights whilst on holiday with my boyfriend, we had paid for the large bed so expected a reasonably big room (like those advertised on the website). We were placed in room 35; the bed was large but the room was not.

The whole layout of the room didn't really make sense. The toilet was on the left as soon as you entered, some steep stairs to the right, a huge cube in the right hand centre of the room that contained the bathroom and then the bed- which took up the rest of the space in the room.
There was about a 6 inch gap at the bottom of the bed and a TV on the wall which made it impossible to get to the other side (you had to climb across the bed to reach it) which was very frustrating.
Additionally, there were some small rips in the curtains and a stain on the bedding- although the quality of everything else in the room was good, it definitely lacks the small attention to detail that would make it a 5 star hotel.

It seemed as though small details had been forgotten about; for example, one of the reading lights at the side of the bed didn't work, there were no drawers in the bed side table, the bin was incredibly small and barely fit anything in it and there were only two plug sockets.

The room was small, however it did have a mezzanine floor that looked over the bed. This is a great idea- but not ideal if you have any mobility problems as the stairs were incredibly steep and difficult to get up and down from, especially if you have feet bigger than a size 5. 
At the bottom of the stairs there is a wardrobe and a mirror, both were incredibly dark and the stairs blocked the mirror meaning you couldn't take a step back to use it. 
The second wardrobe was also incredibly dark which made picking out clothes at night difficult and just not very 'hotel friendly'.

The darkness was made even worse by the horrific lights in the bathroom that after 5 minutes of use dimmed so much they were practically turned off. This again made the bathroom difficult to use- particularly when trying to do make up.

The bathroom itself was made from glass walls; lighter on top and dark in the middle. This meant that you could see the other person in the bathroom at all times, this wasn't really an issue for us, but if you stay here make sure it is someone you are comfortable with! The same goes for the toilet, which is separate to the rest of the bathroom. Both the doors on the bathroom and toilet were the same: glass and swung both ways- if you're not careful you can open the door and slam it straight into the toilet. Neither shut properly, they just 'close to'. Much like the room, the bathroom lacked the finer details. Round the edge of the sink looked 'grimey', there was a stain in the toilet, no door on the shower meant some of the floor got wet if you aren't careful and some of the jets on the shower spray the wrong way. 
A note for the ladies: bring your own hairdryer- the one provided is awful.

However, in saying all of this, we both had some of the best nights sleep we have ever had in a hotel. The room and surrounding area was quiet, it is in a great location with friendly staff and the rest of the hotel is modern, spotless and elegantly decorated.
There is an excellent iron provided, a heated mirror in the bathroom, great quality soap and shampoo and a superb restaurant downstairs. 

The aircon is reasonable (however it only goes down to 19) and there is a fridge provided that you can fill at your leisure. There are two TVs and a quirky doorbell outside your room.

There is no doubt that this is a great hotel and I would definitely stay again, but I would made sure we were in a different room.",2,2017,06,16
100,Amazing ,"This hotel was amazing, me and my boyfriend went for his birthday. The staff were most helpful and lovely. The room was luxurious with good aircon. The bed was huge and so comfortable I didn't want to get out! 
However, it was a bit dark with no dressing table mirror. And you could hear the doors opening and shutting from other rooms. 
Nevertheless we had an amazing time and would definitely stay here again!  ",4,2017,06,14
100,better avoid...,"Our room was an overrated  disaster (room 231), dirty, smelly, hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms.
We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared, the smell of the gutter was very disturbing, the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine. We found the whole hotel dirty, dusty and dated. To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery.

눇
The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food-dishes on the buffet. We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional.
We had a wedding in the hotel's chapel so the convenience of ""just"" walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location.",2,2017,06,13
100,Birthday trip to Amsterdam,"We were staying in Hotel Arena just a week ago when my boyfriend had his 30th birthday. Arena was really nice hotel and I liked it because it was different that others and it has interesting history. Staff was nice, friendly and helpful and gave extra value to our experience. Breakfast was amazing, more like a brunch. Rooms were clean and beautiful. There were still renovation going on but it didn't bother us at all. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and others. :)",5,2017,06,09
100,Better than I hoped for....,"We picked this hotel to stay in recently based on location.   Basically it is a lovely part of the city, near our friends, with lots of good bars and restaurants nearby.  I have to say it was better that i was expecting.

On the positive:
Great location (lovely park in front)
Friendly staff
Good rooms
Recently done up
Nice food

Cons
Not cheap
Bedroom stairs is a challenge in heels!
Little dark
Service not amazing
Overall though,  it was better than I imagined, and probably deserves a 4.5 rating.  We will go back. ",4,2017,06,08
100,Nice hotel but inconsistent housekeeping.,"Hotel Arena has plenty of potential, lovely staff and great buildings (under renovation). My only reservation was that we stayed for 4 nights and the room was not cleaned. The housekeeping staff visited the room daily and ""straightened up"". This did not include vacuuming, changing bed or replenishing toiletries. This place could be wonderful if the housekeeping was managed. Sadly I cannot rate the hotel any higher than average because after 4 nights our room was not fresh. Other reviewers have made similar comments and I should have taken this into account before booking. ",3,2017,06,07
100,Hopefully it's better now...,"I'm sure that at one time, this hotel was good.  Based on the photos of the renovation, I'm sure that it will be good again.  But when we were there, it was not.
First, our room was dirty and dated.  It wasn't the fault of the housekeeping staff -- I'm sure they did the best they could; the issue was with things like a dingy sofa that you wouldn't want to sit on, or the floor that needed to be pulled up and replaced, or the shower floor that you don't want to use unless you wear sandals.
Secondly, the hotel was being renovated so the entrance was dark and scary, and the noise of the machinery was constant.  It wouldn't be so bad if they were upfront about this at the time of booking; instead, we didn't find out until we arrived.  The only thing they did to make up for it was a free drink coupon.  Not good.  Even the photos of the hotel on the website and their Instagram page seem too good to be true -- because they were.  The only reason to stay here is if you had a conference or some business to do at the University nearby; otherwise, just pick a place closer to the city center.
The people at the front desk were fine -- when they were there.  Many times, we walked by and the area was empty and dark, and you had to search for someone to help you.  
The best part of the hotel was the restaurant and courtyard bar: the food was good, the staff was friendly, and it was a nice area to hang out in.  It was a sanctuary in a place that's seen better days.",2,2017,06,06
100,Beautiful but a bit noisy,"Stayed for 3 nights. Place looks really good and has a tranquil feel. Our room looked pretty good, but was rather noisy, due to a corridor door that was close by.
Pay attention to the fact that the bathroom/ toilets has (non transparent) glass walls and doors, and there's a lack of privacy. We asked specifically for a room with most privacy and I was glad to find out they took our request into consideration.
The buffet breakfast is a good value for money: it costs 17.5 euro pp, or 15.5 if booked in advance.",4,2017,06,05
100,Delightful 3night 4 days stay!,"Me and my partner came here for our anniversary on 23rd May-26th May 2017. It was a 30 minute taxi journey to the hotel from the airport. When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted by two friendly members of staff who showed us to the reception desks, after a short walk down the hall way we was greeted again by a lady on reception who was very quick and efficient at checking us in, giving us our key cards, paying city tax and giving us some information on the hotel and how to get to our room. 

We made another short walk along a hall to the elevator to take us up to floor 2 where our room was. Walked in the door of our spacious room and was instantly happy with the room we was given. The room had a very large comfortable bed, television, tea and coffee making facilities, decent size wardrobe, electronic safe, iron and ironing board, english plug socket, mini fridge and a big enough bathroom with towels. Despite being able to see through the glass in the bathroom this did not put us off in any way like other people have mentioned in reviews. Our beds were made everyday, tea and coffee was stocked up and clean towels everyday if needed. The only negative thing i would have to say about the room was the floors could have been swept when the cleaners came in. Did this affect our stay though? No, not really. 

Wifi is available throughout the hotel with no password needed.

Location of the hotel was amazing, every morning and evening we would have a stroll around the lovely park. 

Overall, a great hotel at a great location with very friendly staff members. We would love to return in the near future. Thank you for having us and making our stay worthwhile. ",5,2017,05,31
100,Excellent,"This place is just on the park; it's an absolutely beautiful park! Rockpools, play area, fountains, trees, bandstand, grassy expanses, even a lake with a few herons! People running, walking, sleeping and doing yoga everywhere - absolutely idyllic. The hotel is lovely too, great bar, awesome breakfast (including mimosa), really nicely designed, lovely room. Check-in experience wasn't the best, and few design annoyances (tap/kettle comes to mind!), but apart from that, really excellent!",5,2017,05,28
100,Great staff!,"My wife and I stayed here 12th May - 16th 2017.
All the staff we encountered were fantastic.
The room we had was in the roof space which was fine, good size and comfortable.
Silly things:- 
Plug the kettle on the bed side table? why not on the tv table?
No drawers or shelves for clothes.
Bathroom was very stylish but the washbasin is square with a very small side shelf, also floor tiles in the shower area are very slippery when wet!

The breakfast was very good but no fried or poached eggs, only tomatoes on one day (out of four)
The location is excellent with good tram connections.
Will be even nicer when refurbs are complete.",4,2017,05,28
100,No privacy in the toilet. Bathroom walls made of glass.,"I wanted to give this beautiful hotel the highest rating, but as we got a room where you could not have your privacy when going to the toilet, I can only give three out of five.
What were they thinking when they decided to build bathrooms/toilets with glass walls? No one wants to be seen sitting on the toilet or see another person sitting on the toilet. The bathroom door did not close either.

Otherwise a beautiful hotel, very good restaurant, very nice staff, beautifully located in a park (not very central though).

Because of the see-through bathroom/toilet I can not give this hotel the best rating.",4,2017,05,25
100,The worst cleaning ever !,"The last days we went in Hotel Arena Amsterdam, with friends. The hotel is nice, the location is beautiful, but for the price and for a **** hotel, we expect more. The dinner was good, but the breakfast was for a *** hotel, really basic. The rooms are big, and simple decoration. The worst part: the cleaning. They don't clean the floor for 3 days, they don't have any idea how to do one bed. Was really bad! And sometimes you can smell like if someone is smoking in the rooms.. strange! 
But.. the stuff was friendly!",3,2017,05,17
100,Amazing Stay at a quirky hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in October and was very impressed. Although a little bit out of the centre the bus's and metros were easy enough to follow. The hotel was going through some renovations at the time and we were lucky enough to experience the new restaurant/bar which was lovely for a cocktail ( I can imagine how fantastic the rest of the hotel will look once it is finished). The room was modern with a nice bathroom and lounge area, as well as the bed which was situated upstairs on its own level. Free Wifi around the hotel and all facilities were great. 
Would defiantly come back here!",5,2017,05,15
100,First time in Amsterdam ,"4 day visit, pleased with the room, beds very comfy, nice shower, hairdryer did not work, but just picked up another from reception, staff very friendly..Great location set in park grounds and trams run frequently once you get the hang of it.. Some renovations going on but didn't affect our stay.. would go back again",4,2017,05,13
100,Amsterdam holiday,"Without a doubt, this is a lovely hotel, well situated in and overlooking the park. Our room overlooked the canal which was lovely. We were not informed that our room was split level and the stairs up to the bed were dangerously steep with no hand rails which makes it really scary to get down to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Went to the bar/restaurant several times and sat down and waited. We were consistently ignored while younger couples were served almost immediately. We went and got our own menus and once we were ready to order had to go find a waiter to take our order. However they were prompt enough when it came to paying the bill. Our booking included breakfast but on the first morning we were informed that it was not included so another visit to reception to sort this out. Then on the morning of our last day we had to leave early to catch a train to our next destination and went down to have breakfast and check out and nothing was said about breakfast at that point. It was as we got to the restaurant at 7am that we found out that on weekends, breakfast is not served till 8am and we had to leave by 7:30 at the latest, and nothing could be done. Staff offered a refund of the breakfast for that day but at this point in time we are still waiting. Happy to acknowledge a refund if/when it appears. Had to get breakfast at the train station. So, to summarise, lovely hotel, lovely location, good access to transport but restaurant staff could be better trained to be more observant in attending to all guests and reception staff better trained to ensure they are passing on all relevant information, especially about the type of room, ie split level. The reception staff did try to be helpful with other areas when we specifically asked.",3,2017,05,10
100,Lovely Place! ,"Stayed here for 4 nights in April, and we were both very pleased with the hotel! Loved the area which was quiet and basically inside a lovely park. Getting into the city was easy as the trams stopped close by. They were in the middle of renovation but the people working there were lovely and helpful. Our room was awesome, loved the interior! Our only issue was some small problems related to the renovation, but we were all in all very pleased with our stay! ",4,2017,05,07
100,Loved it," Very clean, spacious rooms, some cool hidden areas haha, nice bar and restaurant downstairs, right next to a beautiful park! I honestly loved it and with 5-6 euro uber ride you can go everywhere! 
They have free internet and you can rent your bike at the receptionist desk. ",5,2017,05,06
100,Why don't Designers of Design Hotels stay in the rooms they design ?,"One of the many things I like about the Dutch  is how positive and friendly they can be. The people working at Hotel Arena were all friendly and ready to help, in a very natural way. It is not always easy dealing with Joe Public, so hats off to them. 

All the positives first ; the Hotel Arena gives out on to a pleasant park - the Oosterpark and is only 10 mins walk from a main Metro station. The breakfast is fine. The room was super-clean. The terrace overlooking the park  makes an attractive location for a relaxing drink.

For the Hotel Arena there is a ""BUT"" and the BUT is whoever approved the design of the rooms on the ground floor behind the temporary reception desk . These rooms - starting at No.20 -  are built into what once must have been a high-ceilinged hall , perhaps  the erstwhile convent's refrectory. The rooms are two-storey and faced with almost floor to ceiling  windows. On the ground floor is a self-contained  bathroom unit containing the wardrobe , shower , lavatory etc, with a small space for a low two person sofa and a desk , then there is a steep , narrow staircase with smooth steps ( no carpet or anything to give grip) and one sharp twist in  it , up to a very comfortable double bed close to ceiling , with no drawers or cupboards to put any clothes. You are best going up the staircase in bare feet to give maximum grip.The bathroom unit is made of black glass which has the disconcerting feature of being completely transparent if the light inside the bathroom unit is on. This does not matter if only one person is using the room but I can imagine that if one of a pair wants to use the lavatory the other is well advised to leave the ground floor or stare out of the window.
Stylistic considerations no doubt also dictated that the shower space should have no door or curtain so that one side of you can freeze whilst the other is warmed by the shower.

I do realise that by putting comfort and convenience above style I am betraying myself as one of the dull herd of the ""un-hip"" , so perhaps this hotel is better suited to  those with a more developed aesthetic sense.",3,2017,05,06
100,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel situated in a park not very far from the centre of the city. I don't give 5* stars because when we checked in they asked us to pay the city tax and we paid it and at the check out they asked us to pay it again, they said it wasn't paid and they had no record of it. I didn't liked that and reception was a bit disorganised because they were having refurbishment at the time. Also, it was too dark on the hallways upstairs. Their restaurant it's very nice and cosy.",4,2017,05,05
100,Missed opportunity,"This hotel is located a the border of the old city center making it a 15min walk into town but it also offers biked at a reasonable price.
The rooms are spacious with incredibly high ceilings (had a room on the first floor) though a bit unpractical. The bed is positioned in the middle with a table and tv at the foot of it (I'm quite tall so you can imagine where my feet where) which also made the two seats at the window utterly useless as you cannot sit comfortable without bumping into the table. The curtains had large holes in them which of course let a lot of light through as well as they could not close completely on the sides.
The shower in the bathroom also made a weird squeaking noise which I also heard in another room (as sounds can be heard from neighboring rooms) and the power of the water coming out was also weak.
The breakfast was a bit disappointing in assortment though sufficient for a one night stay. The smoked salmon was not up to standards. The different sorts of bread was a lovely touch as was the orange juice.

All in all a decent hotel but nothing more. Especially as service at the reception desk was not friendly and pretty direct with other customers (mainly non-Dutch speaking) as I believe they lacked the skills to speak English as well as the experience (all -30year old girls).",3,2017,05,02
100,Very Disappointed with room,"First impression is a lovely restyled building which is very welcoming and modern layout inside. Friendly welcome and quick check in - all good so far. Headed off to room 63 on the ground floor close to reception. Room was divided up with a mezzanine type floor to accommodate the bed. However the stairs to this floor were extremely steep and I would say dangerous, not helped by the hand rail coming away from the wall at the top. There was an excuse for a sofa in the lounge area which was uncomfortable and not pleasant area to sit. No wardrobe or drawer space at all in the room, which I thought would have been a basic requirement. The small fridge and lamp next to the TV were connected through a ball of cables to an extension socket just lying on the floor - really looked bad. To get a useable water temperature in the bathroom sink or shower required an extremely delicate touch and a lot of patience - actually I didn't manage to get sorted on the sink! Indeed the shower position in the bath was totally useless and had to hold the shower head in my hand to make it workable. 
Other than this, the restaurant/ bar area is lovely and the hotel is short distance from tram 3 stop to city centre. I hope that all rooms are not like this and I was just unlucky to get the dodgy room after all other rooms are taken. Only stayed two nights but would have complained if there any longer. ",1,2017,04,28
100,Winter 2016,"We stayed for 4 nights in November 2016, on arrival the hotel did not look very impressive, but we then realised that it was going through some major renovations, the room we were given was very nice (over 2 different floors), and clean. The bar/restaurant area is very nice, especially the open fire. The food was very good in the restaurant, located very close to the tram stop, so travelling into the city centre was no problem. Overall a great stay and we would stay again for sure.",4,2017,04,25
100,first visit to amsterdam,hotel is a lovely old building but is modern inside my wife found it a little bit strange sitting in a see through toilet but otherwise a lovely hotel would use it again for any more trips to amsterdam,5,2017,04,25
100,Wonderful stay,"My friend and I stayed in the Hotel Arena for three nights. We wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is situated in a lovely park but only minutes away from.a tramstop ,so getting around the city is easy. The Staff in the hotel are all lovely, friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. The rooms.are very modern and pointlessly clean. We will definitely  stay here again on our next Amsterdam visit.",5,2017,04,24
100,Nice area but noisy while remodelling,They started drilling saturday at 8am and you could tell hotel was unorganized un terms of service and their staff. It is s really nice área and I think when it is ready Will be great. Food ST the bar was OK. Really good breakfast,4,2017,04,23
100,Renovation,"Just come back from a stay here and whilst the staff were friendly, it was clean and in a nice area no one mentioned the ongoing renovations that woke us at 8 in the morning with the drilling and banging.  We had a standard twin room which was nice but the bathroom whilst clean had a gap in the door way which reduced the privacy you got when on the toilet and the cheap loo roll is never good.",3,2017,04,21
100,Style over substance,"I have rated this hotel average which it is not, but some things about it are very good and some really not very good at all.  The hotel is a renovation of interesting historic buildings - an old orphanage and chapel, and has retained some original features. It is still being renovated and extended so some areas such as reception are temporary but this does not interfere with a stay at all. We found the staff very pleasant. My main issues were with our room.  It looked very nice, modern and stylish but it just didn't function. The room was strangely set out with a nice sofa in a position that rendered it unusable despite there being a much more suitable space the other side of the room, from where we could have sat and watched TV if the sofa had been there.  There is no drawer space - there is a shelf in the wardrobe but it is too high for anyone of average height to use.  The bathroom was the main problem. It was partitioned off from the bedroom by a glass wall.  The glass is darkened, some panels darker than others, but it is still see-through.  The door to the bathroom, also glass, does not shut properly.  So you have no privacy at all in the bathroom, everything you do can be seen and heard by the other person in the bedroom.  This is not suitable for some family groups eg if my husband had been taking his teenage daughter (it was a twin room), business travellers sharing or a new couple on a romantic weekend away.  There is nothing romantic about seeing and hearing someone on the loo!  When I used the shower, which was a wet room type, the entire bathroom completely flooded.  There is nowhere to hang a towel within reach of the shower.  The bathroom was a disaster - real style over substance as it looked nice but was functionally inadequate.  This alone would stop me from staying at this hotel again.
On a more general note, the hotel is in a pleasant situation on the edge of Oosterpark and there are a few nice restaurants around serving mainly locals rather than tourists (Oost pizza and pasta, De Biertuin burgers and chicken). The hotel bar and restaurant is pleasant but they introduced a new sharing menu when we were there which worked out very expensive.  It is a good 20 minutes walk to the city centre or there are trams. Coming from the airport, get a train from Schipol to Muiderpoort station which is less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel.
Overall this is a nice hotel but the bathrooms let it down badly.",3,2017,04,21
100,"Awesome Hotel, great staff, great food, full package of enjoyment!","Easter Dinner was an absolute winner!  The food combinations and cocktail selection were new and refreshing.  Staff were smiley and helpful, even during such a busy period.  With the innovative and exciting new developments, this hotel can only get better. Can't wait to see the veg garden right next to the open kitchen and bar. I will be back! :)",5,2017,04,19
100,Hotel of dreams!,"Simply put, this hotel is just incredible. My partner and I booked this months ago for our first ever holiday abroad, I was nervous and wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the reviews. However the excellent front office staff like Myrta, Marit, Rose and Brandi emailed us to reassure us. Not only this, they arranged a larger room at no extra cost and a bottle of bubbly to celebrate my partners birthday. When I arrived (very late due to flight delay) the receptionist was so friendly and gave us loads of useful tips, we didn't even have to ask! (Also gave us a pizza menu, ordered the pizza for us at 3am, and then took it to our room and no charge- the kindness was incredible!)

The hotel is situated on Oosterpark, this stunning park with a massive lake and gorgeous bridges and smaller parks around, excellent for long walks and has some great cafes.

Overall the hotel itself is excellent, if you are looking for a quiet romantic retreat then this is your hotel to choose. Staff are brilliant in every aspect, hotel is quirky and modern with an old exterior feel that I just adored.

Cannot wait to return, and thank you again for making this a life changing experience!

100,Yummy Easter Lunch ,"I had a great Easter lunch at the restaurant. It was the first time I visited the hotel and I was very impressed.
The lamb was fantastic as was the deserts. 
The staff made us feel very welcome and suggested some nice cocktails! 🤗",5,2017,04,16
100,Lovely hotel in a nice area,"We were delighted with our stay at the hotel, the photos online did not do it justice. A stunning building right next to Oosterpark and our room was very nice and modern. The hotel is close to places to eat and transport links to the city center and other tourist attractions. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,04,15
100,Hotel arena amsterdam,"Situated by a nice park, about 25 mins walk into centre, Lovely modern hotel from converted church, nice outdoor dining area, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms clean with unusual layout of small staircase to bed room",4,2017,04,14
100,Fantastic venue for meetings,"I really can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was at Hotel Arena. 
We conducted a 5 day business meeting in Hotel Arena's Chapel and Studios as well as renting over 60 rooms.  Hotel Arena handled everything beautifully. Any problem that came up was immediately taken care of. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The catered food was excellent, my compliments to the Park Cafe chef and staff.
The location is perfectly situated on Oosterpark and close to Amsterdam proper. 
This is a very charming hotel with an excellent staff. Do not hesitate to book this hotel, especially for business meetings. You won't be disappointed. I look forward to our return. Thanks again Hotel Arena!",5,2017,04,12
100,Unusual Hotel in the Park,"Stayed here for a few days whilst attending a conference in Amsterdam. Its an unusual hotel in that it used to be an orphanage, set in a beautiful park in the east of the city.
The staff are superb, with a casual warmth that makes for a welcome and good service,
The breakfast buffet is wonderful with a great selection and really good coffee and tea.
Rooms are clean and minimal in furnishings, but my shower was very roomy and powerful. Id stay here again, just because I really liked it, although there are other locations canal-side for the tourist/traveller wishing a more traditional setting. Arena is a good find.",4,2017,04,11
100,A building site,"I wasn't told there would be building works going on when I booked this hotel. If I'd known I wouldn't have booked. The hotel is constructing a huge knew wing and as such they should not be putting guests in the rooms close to the site. We were quite literally across a staircase from the works. The construction workers started at 7 every morning. There were no long lies for us.
The room designers have tried for minimal but the walls, furniture, curtains and linens are all in different shades of white and apart from the linens all of the whites are looking a bit grubby.
The beds are a bad combination of soft mattress and hard pillow and therefore a good nights sleep is impossible and you wake up early with a stiff neck.
The layout of the room is poor with the only mirror being stuck in a dark corner with no power supply and no surface to put make up on. 
The bathroom is housed in a black glass cube and looks quite stylish but the doors don't fit properly and there are gaps wide enough to put your hand in at both sides of the door. Privacy on the throne is somewhat compromised. The water pressure in the shower was not great. The towels were ok but a bit too small for a 4 star hotel.
The breakfast was good and the bar area where it is served is really very nice.
The staff in general were nice but not excessively helpful. They gave us the wrong directions for a trip to Keukenhof but fortunately er managed to work it out for ourselves. I also left my shawl in the bar area and was told that it had been passed through to the reception area but they had a rummage about and said they didn't have it. It's hard to know where it could be, I can only assume that one of the staff is now enjoying my lovely fine woollen shawl that cost me a pretty penny.",2,2017,04,11
100,Very good. ,"Hotel being enlarged but this did not affect our stay. 
Asked for room change because shower door in first room did not open/close easily.  (Should have been reported by housekeeping?) 
Did not like the rooms with stairs. Not enough room around beds. Preferred the lighter one we ended up with. 
All the Reception staff were excellent at all times 
Stairs up to our room were dark. 2 lights were out which we reported & were fixed. 
One of the reading bedside lights did not work which we also reported but was not fixed for whatever reason. 
Breakfast layout a bit illogical (plates & bowls not next to the foods they were meant for). Coffee machine initially empty. Thought bit expensive too. 
Beds & bedding very comfortable. 
Convenient for trams & nice easy walk into centre. 
Nice outside bar/restaurant overlooking the park. Service bit slow to begin with. 
I would definitely book here again if I return to Amsterdam.  ",4,2017,04,06
100,Amsterdam Hotel Arena,The hotel is our favorite to visit Amsterdam ! We stayed already 4 times in this hotel and we will return every time when we will visit Alsterdam ! Nice location  nice bedrooms and a lovely restaurant ! The hotel personel is also very friendly and helpfull ! ,5,2017,04,02
100,"Average experience, maybe due to renovation","I stayed for one night. Room was ok but heating did not work. An electric heater was delivered after long wait but also that one was broken. The second worked but was delivered by a very unfriendly person.

We had lunch in restaurant. Food was good but we had to wait more than an hour as order was not received by kitchen. Also we needed to remind them twice before we got our water delivered. Staff was friendly but service very chaotic and inefficiënt. ",3,2017,04,02
100,Varied experiance,"The hotell was ok. Nice enough room, and the service at the desk was good. Noisey at night. The restaurant served great tasting food at expencive prizes. The service at the restaurant was terrible. We had a table, but asked to get another. The waiter made it into a big deal, and then ignored us for the rest of the evening - only to check if we left any tips, which we didnt ofc. For everything we needed we had to ask a different person who then allso spent a long time to help us. We said please and thank you for everything we asked, but i guess asking for another table was too much trouble. ",3,2017,04,01
100,Long weekend,"Very friendly hotel, enjoyable stay with a surprise bottle of bubbly for my birthday. Hotel clean building works on going but never disturbed our stay. Room was a twin standard room but a decent size for two of us with good Wi-Fi access.",5,2017,04,01
100,Good and not so good,"Overall this hotel is in a good location a short walk to trams and right on the edge of a lovely park with walks and a playground. The rooms are spacious and the beds very comfortable. The hotel rooms have recently been renovated and the whole hotel lobby is still being renovated. There's a pleasant cafe downstairs. There were a couple of issues with our stay which was for 4 nights - the room want cleaned properly each night. The garbage bins weren't emptied despite me notifying reception twice and then promising to send someone up immediately no-one turned up. The cups in the rooms weren't washed properly and one day the toilet brush was left in the toilet! The shower also did not drain properly and each time we showered the bathroom flooded. We needed to use our towels each day to soak up the water. Once again we notified reception but nothing was done to fix the problem. As we were checking out we let the front office know how disappointed we were (again) and received the offer of a complimentary breakfast - too little too late as we were off to the airport to catch our flight. 

There are better hotels in Amsterdam.  ",3,2017,03,31
100,Bad experience,"Due to a technical problem I had to change rooms in the middle of the night. In the second room there was serious noise pollution from traffic on the street. My night's rest was totally disturbed. The next day I had a intensive business training, so this stay was very inconvenient.",2,2017,03,30
100,Lovely hotel in a quiet district,Great hotel in a nice area.  Easy access to all areas via the brilliant tram system.  We had problems with people above us and the hotel acted brilliantly and eventually moved us to a new (upgraded) room.  Really helpful staff and a nice restaurant too.,5,2017,03,29
100,great location,Lovely Hotel although there was some upgrading being done did not disturb. Rooms are great and beds COMFORTABLE. very helpful courteous staff!!! Very easy to reach public transportation. Hotel Restaurant is good and prices reasonable. ,5,2017,03,29
100,Fantastic stay!!,"We had a wonderful stay at hotel arena. The staff were friendly and helpful, no issues checking or checking out.
We had 2 breakfast and 1 dinner and 1 room service during our 5 day stay, the food was good quality, but small range of choice. The steak was cooked perfectly for my taste, as was my burger when we ordered room service.
We had lovely walks around the park and into the city centre. The hotel was a good location for us, as we wanted to be out of the main centre, but it was still close enough for us to walk to and from the centre.
The decor was beautiful, the building has been renovated beautifully and our room was quirky, the stairs up to the bedroom were a bit challenging at times, but I loved the layout of the room. 
It had basic facilities but everything we needed.
The staff also accommodated my partners request for a surprise breakfast in bed complete with flowers and balloons for my 30th birthday! He was over the moon as was I! ",5,2017,03,29
100,Superb time at this amazing hotel,"The hotel was immaculate the service was great would recommend this hotel to anyone for any type of visit. I wouldn't stay any apart from here. Look no further and book here, you won't regret it. You'll love every minute of your stay. A fantastic view, lovely area, trams not far, nothings to far, prime location and best of all, the level of service and room quality is amazing.",5,2017,03,27
100,Perfect Location,"We spent four nights at Hotel Arena in February 2017. It's a lovely hotel set on the edge of a beautiful park. The room was nice and the restaurant seemed good, although too expensive for our budget. The hotel is set near great transport links to the centre and the museum square. There are also lots of local places to eat and drink. 

The staff were very helpful and offered us a free breakfast when I had to complain about building noise right under our room. The work was starting just before 9am, which was a little early considering people are on holiday. We were woken on two mornings with banging, drilling and sawing. The first morning we let it go, but complained the second morning.

The room was clean, although the twin beds kept seperating from eachother and they could do with something to bind them together before losing your partner down the middle gap!! :) 

I would reccomend this hotel but would ask to have a room away from the work being completed.",4,2017,03,27
100,Very nice hotel,"The hotel was very nice, located in a park. Big and spacy areas, like the restaurant and lobby. 
The location was a little of, but it was close to the trams so it didn´t become a problem.  
I would recommend it to my friends. ",4,2017,03,27
100,Disappointing,"Beautiful place with high potential but unfortunately a disappointing experience. Rooms not perfectly kept and need to be refurbished or at least better cleaned. But the main issue of the is the service. We had reserved a “deluxe” room what was obviously not available. As compensation we got an upgrade to a very strange suite, dark room directly giving to the main street and the works. We finally preferred to be downgraded to a more correct standard room. The staff is very young and unexperienced, clearly not at the level of a 4 Star place. The nicely situated restaurant with high quality and correct prices has the highest need for service improvement. We needed first to fight to get a nice table, despite having a reservation. Later we were waiting very longtime for each order as the service was totally disorganized. ",3,2017,03,27
100,Service ? What service ?,"When you eat out in Amsterdam you accept that the service is not good. It's a sad fact of life. It's rubbish generally. 

Which means that when you visit a place that is dreadful even by Amsterdam standards then you know you are close to rock bottom. 

We tried to have lunch today in the Hotel Arena. It looks great. It has a great location and a good vibe. The food is pretty reasonable too. That was the good. 

We found a table and waited for service. And waited. Finally we had a waitress who took our drinks order.  But no menu. And no drinks. After 15 mins we went to the bar to find our drinks. And get a menu. 

We almost had to jump up and down on the table naked to get any  attention but we eventually got in our order. Still no drinks though. Finally the drinks arrived. Hooray !!! And now the food ? After another 20 minutes I went looking for staff to find out where our food was. The kitchen was well staffed but nothing came out of it. The waiter said he'd find out what was wrong. He disappeared and never reported back. After almost an hour our food arrived. It wasn't complete and in order to save time we went to the kitchen ourselves to collect the missing component. 

There is no one in charge here. The staff really do not have a clue what to do or what is happening. If I could have given a negative tip then I would have done. ",1,2017,03,26
100,Great hotel for a city break,"Lovely hotel, currently under renovation but from what we could see of the work being done and the areas open to guests it has the potential to be really good, located in a nice area next to the park, and not too far to travel in order to get to the centre, ideal for a quiet night.",4,2017,03,26
100,Weekend in Amsterdam,"Our stay at Hotel Arena was very nice. We were upgraded to a suite in a tower upon arrival which was a nice surprise. The service at the front desk was very professional but with at personal touch. 

Unfortunately we did not spend much time in the surrounding neighbourhood, but we did not experience the geographic location of the hotel as a problem since the hotel is located with great access to different tramlines. 

",4,2017,03,26
100,Weekend in Amsterdam,We stayed for two nights. I would like to come back when the weather is better and enjoy the outside area of the restaurant and the park. Helpful staff and the perfect breakfast. We were very happy to get a bathtub in our room which we hadn't expected to get! Thumbs up!,5,2017,03,26
100,Nice hotel,"Quirky and cool, i really liked it and the restauarant is really great. Ensure bathrooms could do with more privacy somehow. Location is fine there are 2 nearby trams that get you in to Amsterdam quite easily.",4,2017,03,26
100,Thank you!,"Spent 3 nights here as a base to explore Amsterdam. Great location in a lovely park and easy access to trams in all the directions that we wanted to go. We bought a transport pass at the airport,which lasted us 96hours and cost 22€ each and caught trams everywhere, this was a perfect arrangement. The hotel was clean, great decor and our room and ensuite were spacious and spotless (no milk for our tea tho!) . Breakfast was good and the evening meal we ate on our first evening was tasty. The hotel is undergoing renovations and expansion at the moment, but neither disturbed our stay (nor did the conferences that were being held at the time of our visit) The staff were  charming and attentive, without encroaching on our space. We really can't recommend it enough and our only minor niggle would be the choice of music in the restaurant- there is so much good music about, the 'plinky plonky' canned version being played over the system, seemed a mismatch to the chic sophisticated image they appeared to be aiming for!",5,2017,03,24
100,Hotel Arena,The hotel looked lovely and the situation was very pretty. I didn't mind that it was in the process of being refurbished but I thought it was really expensive for the distance from the centre and the facilities on offer and I've paid less and stayed in far better hotels.The breakfast was decent and staff were ok but I was a bit disappointed. ,3,2017,03,24
100,3 days in DAM.,"Great hotel, 40 min walk from centre however. Fabulous rooms and great staff. Disappointed with restaurant - not enough choice for the majority, so chose to eat elsewhere. Lovely location right on the Oosterpark. Great wifi and great facilities in room itself. Only thing that let it down was the poor food and the long walk to the centre of Amsterdam. ",5,2017,03,23
100,Good hotel,Great location and price. Food and bar lovely. Service good. Rooms in eves a bit small. Very quirky and different. Lovely views onto park from restaurant. Staff very attentive. We had a nice stay but the room was a bit small for 4 nights stay.,4,2017,03,23
100,Hotel Arena in a beautiful Park,"This was my first visit to Amsterdam. I'm glad I stayed at such a nice, modern Hotel. The location was perfect. Rather than being in central, it was in a lovely, quiet park and the tram line (number 9) was directly outside the Hotel leading to central. 
The Hotel was very clean and the housekeeping service was very efficient. 
The design of the room was pretty cool, with two floors. 
Only comments to make are that the room design may make one feel slightly claustrophobic,when one showers the water ends up going literally everywhere in the bathroom area due to no barrier- this is a big let down. Also it is good to know beforehand that the shower area is separated by transparent glass. 
It was nice that we were given a complementary drink due to building work. but the building work was not an interference and was managed well. Staff were very polite, approachable and friendly.  The Breakfast served was very nice and a good variety was available. ",5,2017,03,23
100,Great hotel,Great place to stay if you want to be just outside the old town. Easy to get to old town and majority of main attractions. Staff excellent. Wonderful room very clean. Price of food and drinks very competitive. ,5,2017,03,22
100,Not very spacious room!,"I stayed here with my spouse yesterday, for three days. It was a great stay, but the room made me feel really claustrophobic. The bathroom was made with glass walls, therefore, a see through bathroom. I didn't like that. The extension for the kettle was dangling and would drop behind the spiral stairs every time I used it. It was a good 15 mins away from Dam square, which was nice. The hotel is situated in a lovely park that is safe to walk/cycle in, day and night. The nicest complementary bath soap I have ever had at a hotel anywhere.

The breakfast at the hotel was brilliant but way over priced. Lovely architecture in and out. The locals were lovely and there are a few museums within a ten min walk.

The bed was super super soft and so was the linen, and towels. I could hear the neighbors till late at night, very think walls. I would not stay at this hotel for more than  two days because it feels too small.",4,2017,03,22
100,Fantastic Hotel,"Our stay was excellent. Perfect location. Wonderful staff. We can't wait to come back. A truly fantastic hotel only getting better with the renovations due to be completed early summer.
Highly recommended!",5,2017,03,22
100,Great stay for city travel not on a budget,The hotel is in a very convenient location. Walking distance to the city center but still in a quiet neighboorhod. The park outside was a great add on if it would habe been nice weather. Very friendly staff. Great food and drinks. Would definitely recommen going there. ,4,2017,03,21
100,Weekend in Amsterdam,"Easy to get to hotel, the number 9 tram from the railway station took us 6 mins walk away. We walked through the park where the entrance of the hotel looks over. Friendly welcome by concierge and girls on desk. Room was really cool and modern. Our room was like a mini suite. Fridge in room so we kept our own water and wine in it. Had a nice drink in the bar/dining area, cozy and comfortable. There was a lot of building going on around the hotel as it is obviously being renovated in areas. Will only make it better. The Arena does have a history as it used to be an old orphanage and it does gave that 'feel' about it but not in a bad way! Would recommend especially for the young. Nice enough area and easy to get into town.j",4,2017,03,21
100,Fab hotel outside of town,"on arrival we got an upgrade which we were delighted with, the room was like an apartment rather than a hotel room. the hotel itself was spotless and quirky but the location was the only slight downside as there was no shops,cafes or anything nearby! 5 min walk or so to tram line but make sure to bring a brolly as it rained the whole weekend we stayed. worth the stay just be mindful its near nothing and you will need to go into the centre for absolutely everything",4,2017,03,21
100,A gem!,"The hotel was a great choice and really improved our stay in Amsterdam. It is really stylish and trendy which I appreciate. It is also very clean which I find very important. All the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is slightly outside of the centre but you could walk in 15-20 mins. Trams are difficult to navigate but that is nothing to do with the hotel. The location is perfect if you like dropping into the busy city during the day and prefer to relax at night time in a less busy area. I found I needed the calm of the hotel at night. Its probably one of the best hotels in amsterdam. We walked into the town every day and got the tram or taxi home. 

The bedroom was very nice and cozy. It was stylish and modern. The shower was a great walk in one. The bed was really big with a nice duvet but slightly lumpy pillow (and only 1). The pillow was the only fault i found throughout my stay. I didn't say it to the front desk but I am sure they probably would of been more than happy to help. 

The resteraunt is really nice, its clean, modern and the food is great. The breakfast is also delicious. The hotel sits on the edge of Oosterpark which is really nice to stroll around after breakfast or at night. The hotel building itself is magnificient, It is an old but refurbished building with a really modern interior which I love. 

I could not recommend this hotel more. Definitely one of my favourites. I am so glad I picked it, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Amsterdam. I will definitely be back!",5,2017,03,21
100,Amazing hotel and room!,"The hotel was so modern and spacious. Our hotel room was amazing, the stairs leading up to the bedroom made it feel so cosy! Just a short walk from the tram stop, which took about 5-10 mins to the centre. Breakfast was nice and the service was great. Will be staying here if I visit Amsterdam again!",5,2017,03,20
100,Decent Hotel w. Room for Improvement,"Overall my stay was pleasant. Room service could've taken better care of cleaning the floors. Some of the single level rooms smell like sewage/mold. The guests that joined me had to change rooms a total of 3xs because the scent was unbearable. This was annoying for me as they had to hold their luggage in my room as they waited for their rooms to be ready. The restaurant is okay, no more than one option for vegans on the lunch menu and none on the dinner menu. The location is JUST outside of the city center, no more than a 20min walk or 5min uber drive to get where you want. I found it very easy to get around and since most things close around 10pm it was a nice place to retreat to after a long day. There aren't many resturants surrounding the hotel though. 
Once complete it could be a great hotel",3,2017,03,20
100,Review,"Good location. Rooms were amazing. Staff weren't friendly, you can hear noise through the walls in the rooms, very loud in the night time slamming doors in the corridor. Sheets were not cleaned the three nights I stayed there by the cleaner",4,2017,03,20
100,Average overpriced hotel,"nice surrounding but far from the city center
Room amenities were poor and toilet had a standard glass window for everybody to see. 
The hot water did not work well in the first room and they changed rooms, slightly upgraded. This took take and by the time it was sorted, the restaurants had all closed.",2,2017,03,20
100,Double bed room,"very cold in the room
Very uncomfortable beds
Dirty floor
stuff not to willing to help
Bar and dinner was good
Location ok
Furniture not enough to put your things on
Space was very limited
Floors outside dirty and noisy",2,2017,03,20
100,One good night,"Silence location, nice staff, very comfortable room. Everything was perfect except dirty window with so beautiful view) 
Even the construction of the neighboring building didn't prevent to rest after a long road.
So we'd love to come back.",4,2017,03,20
100,Couldn't have asked for more,"Lovely hotel located amazingly on the edge of the park and walkable to the centre. Very fancy compared to my usual surroundings, and there was construction at the time so the new build will add to the great experience. Staff are great and ready to assist with any needs and rooms are nicely designed ",5,2017,03,19
100,Amsterdamish place,"I stayed in a loft type room at the house next to the hotel. Trully unique experience staying in a cozy, posh, awesome and stylish place with an Amsterdam soul. Room is also equiped with a fire place which makes it even more special and romantic. Bed was comfortable and bathroom was clean with fine quality cosmetics. Also you have a coffee machine and it is warm inside. Staff was very polite and professional. Highly recommended!",5,2017,03,19
100,Amsterdam short break 2017,"The hotel is beautiful and the park setting is wonderful too and you are only a 10 minute tram ride from Amsterdam Centre (they run every 10 minutes)
Staff are pleasant, very knowledgable and helpful. The breakfast is typical continental however day menu is limited
When the remodelling is finished (which did not disturb us at any time) it will be even better.
This is an  tranquil place within a very busy city",4,2017,03,19
100,Best hotel I've ever stayed in!,"I was gobsmacked with how incredible this hotel actually is, it was our first time staying in Amsterdam, and the staff were so welcoming, they were there if we needed anything, and the location of the hotel was really amazing, walking out of the doors to this beautiful park, and there were taxis everywhere if you wanted to go else where, the room was better than I could ever imagine, and I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone who's wanting to stay here, ",5,2017,03,19
100,Unique Showcase of Dutch Design & Comfort,"Hotel Arena is a true gem in a city already full of architectural and design wonders. From the stunning entrance in Oostpark to the industrial chic / almost steam punk aesthetic to the wonderful beds, this hotel exudes class and cool.",5,2017,03,19
100,Beautifully cosy hotel,"We celebrated with my girlfriend our anniversary here and were pleasantly delighted by how close it was to the centre by bike, walking or the metro. We booked a standard room which was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable, with the exception of the pillows being a little too big for our liking.
Hotel staff were lovely too, however the restaurant and bar need to improve on their service. We decided to have dinner one night and it took well over 40mins to receive our starter which was a soup. Same for the bar, 20mins + for a tea and beer. 
Aside from this, the food was good, the entire hotel was clean and absolutely lovely to look at. But as said before, the service is what really made this stay average. ",3,2017,03,19
100,Blissful stay at Hotel Arena,"We stayed at the Hotel Arena for three nights to see the sights of Amsterdam. We were looking for a peaceful base close to the city centre and that was exactly what it provided. Lovely, comfy beds, glorious shower and trendy room  interiors. My only quibble/tip to management would be to install plug points next to a mirror as to had to straighten my hair via the reflection of the wardrobe! Also, ensure guests have the options of extra pillows. Other than these minor details, everything was top notch, considering the price we paid. Ensure to sit by the glowing fire for after-dinner drinks and take a walk around the beautiful park for which the hotel is based in. Also, do not be afraid to ask the hotel staff to show you around. The kind gentleman based on the lobby showed us the chapel inside the hotel, now being used for weddings, is spectacular. There were some rennovations taking place during our stay but I did not hear a thing. Thank you Hotel Arena for a relaxing stay :) ",5,2017,03,19
100,Second Stay!,"We returned to the hotel as we loved the hotel and especially the rooms. Rather than an open shower like previously, we had a huge corner bath which made the stay really romantic. The beds were as comfortable as we remembered, especially as they are in a suspended room. The stairs in the room are really steep and dangerous if have difficulty with this but we were ok. The hotel is beautiful, especially now they have renovated and the entrance is on oosterpark. We complained due to being woken early due to the building work but staff responded very apologetically and gave us free breakfast when we asked. It took us a good 30 mins walk to leidersplein and the dam but is a lovely walk along the river. We had the steak for evening meal and was delicious. Would definitely go for a third time :)",5,2017,03,18
100,Best hotel in Amsterdam - ever!,"The location of the hotel is in a nice Park - the terrace overlooks the park and it's a great place to have a drink or work.
The rooms are exquisite and extremely comfortable - they have black out curtains and sound proof - which is quite something in Amsterdam where usually it's impossible to sleep withou earplugs and eye masks.
The gigantic bed and the linen were crisp and oh so comfortable, and all this for less than 100€!
Will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,03,18
100,Great Stay,"It was a wonderful stay. We had been upgrade and had a wonderful room, with an amazing bath ub.The staff was very kind and helpful :) it is a little bit far from the Central (20-30 minutes by walk). 
I highly recommand the Arena Hotel",5,2017,03,18
100,Arena trip hôtel,"There was an odor of toilets very uncomfortable during all night in the room due to the renovation of the hotel. for that reason, I wont advise any traveler to stay during all the working period. Car Park is expensive. ",2,2017,03,18
100,Quality hotel,"Nice location polite staff
Great food and drink
This hotel is a must stay i can't believe this was so cheap to stay when you have a room that looks like a 5 star hotel. Bed is the comfiest I've ever stayed in. 

Thank you for the stay.",5,2017,03,17
100,Great stay,Staff are extremely lovely and room is very nice. They were painting outside our room when we stayed so they gave us free breakfast on both days and free drinks on one of the evening to make up for it. ,4,2017,03,17
100,Beautiful Hotel,"Work is going on to build a new wing, we never heard a thing! Fantastic service all round. Trams 7 /10 then the 16 to get to centre. €7.50 for 24 hour ticket. Super market within walking distance and the zoo is 5 min! ",5,2017,03,17
100,Very nice hotel,went with some friends march '17 for a few days. Lovely stay and grreat hotel. The rooms have two floors which is slightly unusual but other than that I had no issues. Buffet breakfast includes prosecco @ 17eur50!,5,2017,03,16
100,"wonderful atmosphere, great location, superb restaurant, great staff!","The hotel is an extraordinary mix of old and new, as the Dutch do so well. The original building was a convent, and the developer maintained the high ceilings, ornate balustrades, and architectural details, then added ultra-modern elements. Rooms are modern, with beautiful bathroom fixtures, lights, and ample, comfortable bedding. The breakfast, cafe, and bar offerings are fantastic - lots of fresh, organic, and local food. The hotel is undergoing further renovations, but the two new wings are expected to open this summer, and the hotel remains open and accommodating during renovations.",5,2017,03,16
100,Highly recommend,"We have just returned from a lovely stay in this hotel and I would definitely return. Our room was lovely, spacious and clean with calming decor, high ceilings and a very comfy bed. There was a slight lack of privacy with the bathroom as it was a glass box in the corner of the room and the door didn't lock, the glass is blacked out so most of you cannot be seen however noises were very audible so put the tv on or play some music if it bothers you, I was with my husband so it wasn't much of an issue. The setting of the hotel is stunning, the restaurant/bar terrace and entrance to the hotel overlooking a beautiful park on the outskirts of the city, the city center is easily accessible both by tram or a 30 min walk. We bought a 3 day pass from the train station at the airport and travelled in to Amsterdam from there, used the tram systems most of the time then caught the train back to the airport. If you want to stay in a busy city but not right in the center then this hotel is perfect and I would highly recommend it. ",5,2017,03,16
100,Hotel Arena,We enjoyed a very Nice stay in a large room with beautiful Interior! One point to criticise is the bathroom wall. The Door can't be closed and it is more like a room divider than a wall with a door. But The bathroom itself is very Pretty and clean. In my opinion the cleanliness could be improved a little bit as we had some dusty corners in our room and blue stains on our towels. ,4,2017,03,16
100,Hotel Arena - super special place to stay,"An impressive hotel, with efficient staff.  Good transport links to the centre, beautiful location.          A lovely chapel within the building, beautiful stained glass windows, sweeping ornate staircases Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,03,15
100,Would recommend,Lovely hotel and great location and service. There is renovation work going on at the moment but this did not disturb us or have any real impact on our stay. There was a smell of drains from the bathroom in our room that we couldn't get rid of and we lost all power to the room the morning that we left which left is trying to get ready and pack in the dark using our phone torches.,4,2017,03,14
100,Outstanding service and great atmosphere,"Great location, very professional and helpful staff. They helped with directions, they provided a super fast check in before the actual check in time. 
Breakfast buffet was great, the quality of food was very high. 
Hotel has an amazing patio area with a very nice view. ",5,2017,03,14
100,Best Place to Stay in Amsterdam,"Hotel Arena is a brilliant place. Great location in a quiet neighbourhood with a park entrance. The recent refurbishment has just added to its qualities. Great staff, excellent food, great rooms with high quality linen and comfy beds.",5,2017,03,14
100,Hotel arena,This was our 2nd time at hotel arena! Absolutely fantastic hotel and will be even better once the renovation works have been finished! The setting leading straight on to the park is fantastic and in nice weather it is such a great spot to sit outside on the terrace at the hotel bar and watch the world go by. ,5,2017,03,14
100,The Best,"magnificent hotel, located in a fantastic park.
Bele rooms and practices, only flaws localization (leggiarmente outside the center) and sufficient cleaning (found on the bed of the hair).
But the service is exceptional and beautiful rooms",4,2017,03,13
100,Lived up to expectations and more! ,"I booked hotel arena around 10 months ago and to say the least, was very excited to stay in such a quirky hotel, and it did not disappoint! 

Please don't let them renovations put you off as they in no way affected our stay. And the view from the hotel is beautiful, the Oosterpark is literally on the doorstep!

Staff were very friendly, and were more than happy to help if needed, I emailed requesting a split level room and the staff done everything they could to ensure I stayed in one- thank you so much! 

Room was lovely, clean and the extra upstairs level was so handy as me and my OH always tend to get in each other's way when getting ready but that was not an issue with our split level room. 

Would definately recommend and already planning to visit again when all renovations are finished! ",5,2017,03,13
100,Short break,"Just beautiful, large room, clean and warm, staff friendly. Very close to the city zoo and easy to catch the local tram service. Under a lot of renovation but it doesn't stop from 1st class service. We would definitely go again",5,2017,03,13
100,"Great Hotel,, Great Location and great staff","Just returned from 4 days in Amsterdam staying at this hotel. Check-in was easy and staff very friendly. Room was bright and spacious and very clean. Breakfast buffet had a great selection and the bar area very clean and the staff very polite and helpful.
Lovely park just opposite hotel great for a morning or late evening stroll. 
Tram  9 from central station takes you to hotel and again tram 9 into town takes you right into Dam square and only about a 10 minute journey. Worth getting a day ticket at around 7 euros per person. 
I ordered the birthday package for my partners birthday for when we arrived at the hotel and the hotel to my surprise very kindly gave us this for free I found out on arrival which was a lovely gesture.
Current building works going on within hotel but did not impact our stay one bit and even the builders were very polite when we saw them going to and from our room. The building still looks immaculate and the service standards have clearly not slipped whilst this refurbishment takes place.
Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would definitely return. Thank you to everyone at Hotel Arena!!",4,2017,03,13
100,Unique accessible hotel concept,"The Arena Hotel doesn't fail to impress by mixing an old monastry with its modern designs. The rooms are surprising and foreseen of all comfort. I particularly enjoyed the simple but plentyful breakfast and the friendly staff service. 

I do recommend asking the hotel to book you a room away from the street side, since it can get quite noisy. But the hotel is near tram stops, metro and supermarkets. What I loved was the minibar you could stock yourself!",4,2017,03,13
100,Under renovation! Woukd be a very nice place in near future.,"Decent hotel, currently under renovation so a bit inconvenient but once the renovation ia dont this will probably be the best hotel in the area. Management should work on better amenities in the rooms which will make the experience better. ",4,2017,03,13
100,Smallest room EVER,We were given the smallest room EVER room 240 ..we were told it was a standard room !!!!!! and thought we would be given a better room we were not ... the corridors are black and dark ..not sure why .. the breakfast is very expensive .. being within the park is pleasant,3,2017,03,12
100,Excellent Hotel,"We were impressed. The modern, clean and very cool Ambiente of the hotel. Of course, it is still partly under construction, but that is not a problem in any way. The rooms are clean and modern. The glass wall to the bathroom gives the extra luxurious touch.
Amsterdam city Center is just a couple of minutes away and can easily be walked. Would clearly recommend and come again. ",5,2017,03,12
100,Perfect!,"I enjoyed staying in this hotel, they are all very kind! I will absolutely come back.
Best regards to everyone, and thank you for being so nice with us! 
The breakfast was good, EVERYTHING was good.
Thankyou bye :)

100,Gothic Greatness ,"Stayed here for a 2 night break. 
Hotel was perfect, location and the building itself is fantastic.
There is major building works currently at the hotel however this didn't affect the services the hotel offers and was ongoing during the day, which we missed as we were out sightseeing. 
Staff were friendly and the food in hotel was also of a very high quality if not a slightly limited menu. 
Would definitely return to this hotel without a second thought. Would recommend. 
",5,2017,03,11
100,Lovely quirky hotel in a beautiful park,"This hotel is so worth the money, the hotel itself is beautiful and the restaurant inside the hotel is absolutely stunning with gorgeous views of the park which is lovely in the mornings! 

The rooms are clean and we had a wonderful walk in shower. The staff are also very helpful at the front desk they gave us maps and directions of how to get to the centre of Amsterdam and the museum district, both are only around 15 minutes away by tram with the stations only 5 minutes away. They also booked us an electric taxi to the airport which was very reasonably priced. In short, a brilliant location although not central but has very accessible transport links and is worth it to stay in such a trendy hotel.",4,2017,03,11
100,"Very Modern, Spacious Room but Under Renovation ","Hotel Arena is accessible by train through Weesperpleijn station from the airport. It's just 10-15 minutes walk, passing through scenic views. The hotel is a heritage site as it used to be an orphanage and currently renovations are ongoing. Just outside is the Oosterpark should you want to stroll, cycle or jog. The hotel rents out bicycles for a fee. Staffs were friendly and helpful, though when we arrived there was a difficulty retrieving our booking. Room was very modern, huge area with adequate amenities. However due to current renovations, you may be unAble to appreciate the whole beauty of the hotel yet.",4,2017,03,10
100,Very pleased with our stay,"We stayed at Hotel Arena for 3 nights, but being there for a full four days almost. 

We arrived and there was a lot of building works going on at the hotel, but it was all elegantly cordoned off and different route round the hotels were pointed out to avoid disruption. The hotel did upgrade our room too, and offer us two drinks, so we were more than happy with this because the building works weren't too big of an issue. The room we had was bright and spacious, there could be a few bits of TLC needed here and there, ie the main light didn't work, and the paint was coming off the ceiling. But the bed was comfy and it was clean and a good size. It was on a really busy road, that was a down side. It was very noisy early in the morning.

We went to breakfast all mornings. The choice was quite good, and the dining room and views to the park were lovely. the staff were helpful, just needed prompting every now and then if there were things empty on the breakfast table. 

We had lunch there one day, and again, the dining room was lovely, and so are the staff, but could do to speed up slightly. 

Overall we were impressed with the hotel, and would stay there again but make sure we were on the park side of the hotel for a quieter night/morning sleep.",4,2017,03,09
100,Hotel Arena's caratteristics,Hotel arena is so beautiful and welcoming. The room was clean. The hotel have a park in front of it that you can walk and run. The service is so good and it can help you 24h to 24h. The position is good: you can go in centre by walking or in tram ( the stop is in front of hotel),5,2017,03,09
100,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff, excellent overall!",Cannot complain- everything you want in a trendy hotel in East amsterdam! The location was great and access elsewhere very easy with the tram service! Room service was good and the food simple but tasty and we'll done! Would highly recommend! ,5,2017,03,08
100,Under construction,"Beautiful hotel room with no heating possibility. Outside and inside temperature was around 7 Celcius degree. No solution offered  by hotel. Free wifi not working, no place to place your suitcase on, safe in a dark locker at the floor and 
Hotel under construction and loud party outside until 2 am.",2,2017,03,08
100,Great Stay- Definitely Come Back,"Fantastic stay at the hotel! Currently under some renovation however, staff were excellent and really helpful and room was brilliant. Stayed for 2 nights. Great location, great rooms! Definitely be back and would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,03,08
100,Really nice place,really pleasant hotel. en suite's were kind of weird though and just a glass box in the room which you could definitely see through when the lights were on. didn't eat the restaurant but food looked ok. breakfast seemed a bit expensive for what it was. we popped in for a drink a few times whilst we were there and every time service was really slow. can easily walk in to the centre of amsterdam if you like a walk but really convenient tram stop also nearby.,4,2017,03,07
100,Lovely hotel,"Staff were lovely and helpful and room was clean and comfy. Only down side is that they are currently doing some refurbishment on the hotel so the front desk is only temporary and if you like a lay in you may hear some works from your room.
",4,2017,03,06
100,Lovely place,"This hotel is lovely, looks modern inside and out. Bit far out from the centre but we ended up walking it every night and getting a bike taxi home for €15! 

Shower tends to flood all over the bathroom floor so going to the toilet after you've had a shower is a bit of a pain and socks get wet. The bathroom has see through glass so there's no privacy, id go with somebody you're very close with.

The bed is absolutely amazing, so warm and cosy. It's massive too! It's quite noisy on a night, then an odd morning the builders would wake you up early too.

Lots of restaurants near by but walk a bit further and there's plenty of cheaper ones near the centre.

It's very easy to go anywhere from this hotel, 10 minute tram ride on the number 9 to centre or 40 minute walk. It's easy enough to get to from the airport too.

Had a lovely stay and would definitely stay here again just wish it was a bit closer! ",5,2017,03,06
100,Nice trip to a fine hotel,We had a nice trip to this hotel. The Parc is nearby and we enjoyed our diner in the restaurant. I think it will be am beautiful hotel once the build is totaly finishes. The city center was a littlebit further away than we thought it would be but reachable by metro in about 15 min.,4,2017,03,06
100,A plesant stay,We came to hotel arena for a couple of days away.. the host was great the rooms were nice and in the summer I can imagine this hotel will be great once all it's renovations are done. Good value for money and not to far from the city centre.,4,2017,03,05
100,"Great setting, shame about the noise!","Lovely setting but shame about being awoken extremely early by loud drilling right outside our room on its exterior, felt as though the walls may have been caving in! Workmen on scaffolding outside of our window greeted us upon investigating, views right down into the bathroom. Really not acceptable. Hotel fixed promptly though to their credit and the staff were friendly. Would stay again but only when they finish building work! ",4,2017,03,04
100,Wasn't happy,"The room was dirty, hair in the shower when we got there, wasn't the room I paid for. Make up on the sheets the curtains were filthy and the only good thing was that the bed was comfy, just didn't feel comfortable staying in the hotel",2,2017,03,04
100,"Great atmosphere, but...","..we had a very loud room.  Unfortunately many rooms face the street, which is quite busy.
Nevertheless we slept well, it was one of the best beds we ever found in a hotel!
The whole facility has a very special and individual style, modern and creative! 
Streetcar to town is quite near, it is easy and fast to get to the centre.
So all in all we enjoyed the stay very much and would/will come again!",4,2017,03,03
100,So-So,"19th century former orphanage that has been modernised with a few original features left. There is still on-going work going on which I assume will mean more rooms? But it's a pity they didn't get things right with the rooms that are already finished, such as lining the door frames so they don't slam so loudly at night and having power points near mirrors! The bathroom looked stylish with a walk in shower but flooded the whole floor after a few minutes. They do provide tea/coffee in the rooms which does not always happen outside UK.",3,2017,03,03
100,Very pleased,"We had the most amazing stay at your hotel. The decor was beautiful, the staff were very polite and helpful the hotel smelt amazing! We also had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant which was lovely! Definitely recommend the steak! Prices are also very reasonable! Have already recommended this hotel to friends and family!",5,2017,03,03
100,Modern hotel with excellent breakfast,"Next to a beautiful park only a walk away from some of amsterdams most respected restaurants, don't hesitate about booking, the staff are very nice and helped us after our flight was cancelled. The breakfast facilities were some of the best I have encountered and offered a broad range of items for everyone, it's seriously worth the money. ",5,2017,03,03
100,Old hostel transformed in a trendy hotel,"Very nice building with old story (If we were the owner of this space we will disclose that). The hotel is well done decorated, as the room too. We have all the amenities that we needed for our stay. Only the AC didn't work.
The staff was kind, always attentive in helping us. 
The housekeeping is really unsatisfactory. The hotel need to improve the restaurant service and the food quality. The prices are too high for the service provided.
The hotel is a little bit far way from the center, but they a metro station close.",4,2017,03,03
100,"Stylish hotel, comfy bed","Rooms are extremely hot, very difficult to sleep at night although bed is very comfy. Hotel being renovated - real shame we didn't see end product. Location of hotel isn't great for city centre. All round decent hotel, wouldn't go back again though soz. ",4,2017,03,03
100,Lovely experience,"The trip ended too quickly. Hotel was better in person than pictured. The bed was absolutely amazing and so comfortable. The surrounding views were beautiful. The staff were all so friendly and welcoming, even the cleaners.",5,2017,03,03
100,Amazing Stay!!,"Had an amazing stay at the hotel Arena! Not quite central Amsterdam however constant flow of nearby trams to get you around the city, with the help of the staff to point you in the right direction! The hotel was stunning and in a beautiful location, everything was perfect! Would stay again and would happily recommend to anyone who was planning a visit to Amsterdam!",5,2017,03,03
100,Amazing hotel!,"My girlfriend and I visited in late November (i know its a bit late to write a review!!!) We arrived at the hotel and were shown to our room by Sander the receptionist who was warming from the moment we walked through the revolving door. We had booked a standard room and we were amazed with what we were given. A spacious room split over 2 levels with the bed upstairs. Already it was one of the best rooms we had ever stayed in. Later that evening we reported an issue of the extractor fan being broken, it wouldn't turn off and was venting out a fairly unpleasant smell. The smell could only be smelt in the toilet. Sander said he would have the issue rectified but the fan needed a technician. Sander apologized for the issue and upgraded us to an even better room. Every time we came in and out of the hotel he was happy to help us and provided great information on the city. Thank you Sander and hotel arena for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2017,03,02
100,great hotel !!!,"Super hotel. Nice location near park. 
Parking of the hotel expensive (30€/day) comparing to Qpark nearby (12€/day).
We missed an info desk to provide us information on public transportation to the city centre (metro, tram, bus).
Room 126 has its bed on the first Floor. Much warmer there than downstairs (bathroom). Could not change heating. Must be hot upstairs in summer.",4,2017,03,02
100,"Lovely hotel, undergoing work","Was a beautiful hotel and our room was second to none on two levels! However, the hotel is undergoing a lot of work meaning we were woken by heavy drilling and workmen outside our newly made balcony from scaffolding at 8-9am everyday so could not sleep. It is quite a distance from Dam Square so now have toned leg muscles from all of the walking. The staff were absolutely amazing and Monique from front desk was so helpful at pointing us in the right direction for the sites we wanted to see! I believe this hotel would be amazing once the work is done!",5,2017,03,02
100,3 night break,We visited Amsterdam for the first time we were pleased with the hotels location just outside the main city but with local transport links and even a pleasant walk you could be in the middle of museums shops or just getting lost among the canals and local bars ,5,2017,03,02
100,Our stay at Hotel Arena,"This hotel was fantastic, all staff very accommodating and the room was very clean and had mostly all the amenities necessary for our stay. The location was out of town so nice and quiet, but close enough to 4 different tram lines for ease of getting around the beautiful city.",4,2017,03,01
100,Highly recommend ,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend. At first, we weren't impressed with the room we were given, however, we informed staff about this and they gave us a different room the very next day which was much more pleasant/suitable for us. Beautiful old style building with a modern twist. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made us feel comfortable throughout our stay. Very clean. Great food. Not far to walk to the centre of Amsterdam... would happily stay again!

",5,2017,03,01
100,Best staff ever.,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It's suitable for all ages, The staff are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure you are comfortable, happy and having a good time.
The hotel itself is in a beautiful location with the park literally on the doorstep. The food and drink are of high quality. Would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.",5,2017,03,01
100,A hidden gem,"This hotel was a lovely stay! The staff were helpful, kind and welcoming! The location of the hotel was only a plus, located in a lovely public park just out of the city centre. Our room was ready about three hours early so we were able to happily check in as soon as we arrived. Lots of construction going on around the hotel, just outside of our window in fact but due to the style and comfort of the place it was no bother. I imagine this place to be even more beautiful one it has been finished. A lovely stay, would recommend. ",4,2017,03,01
100,Excellent Room,Loved my stay in this hotel. I've stayed here before and each time was just as good as it was before. The staff are there to help with any problems that may arise during the stay. Bed was very comfortable and big. The room was always kept warm. ,5,2017,03,01
100,"Great Location, nice hotel","Great value for money. Not far from the town center at all, and situated in a park which was nice. The hotel it's self is being renovated but that didn't affect our stay at all. Ate dinner in the restaurant which was beautiful and very fairly priced compared with the rest of Amsterdam. Would definitely go back.",5,2017,03,01
100,Rooms let the hotel down,Beautiful building in a nice location over looking a park. Doesn't take long on a tram to get into the city centre. Lots of attention to detail in the bar/restaurant area and friendly and efficient staff in reception. Reception area and corridors undergoing renovation but it didn't affect our stay. Rooms were a real let down in comparison to the rest of the hotel. Finishings were poor and very run down looking. The floors and bathroom area hadn't been cleaned properly and we couldn't walk around the room without shoes on. The bathroom has a glass partition for a wall and provides no privacy from the rest of the room. We wouldn't return based on the cleanliness and layout of the room we stayed in. ,3,2017,02,28
100,10/10! Can't think of anything negative to say!,"Stayed at the Hotel Arena for 4 days last week, and safe to say it did not disappoint. The staff were so helpful and caring, always going the extra step to make sure you were enjoying the stay. For the price we paid the room was perfect!

Location is great too, only takes around 10/15 minutes to walk near the local attractions, such as museums, coffeeshops etc.

Will definitely be staying here on my next visit!",5,2017,02,28
100,"Beautiful location, lovely hotel","The hotel is located in the middle of Oostarpark, which is very beautiful. It's 7 minutes ride on the tram (station located near the hotel).
The staff are lovely and very useful.  
We didn't like two things: 1. they didn't swipe the floor when cleaning up the room, 2. the radiator makes noises after a few minutes of working (it's even more annoying in the middle of the night). ",4,2017,02,28
100,Love it !,"Amazing hotel ! Staff very kind ! Fell in love with the place. Breakfast is excellent, a bite expensive. The Park bar-restaurant is really cozy ! Disapointed about the cleaning of the room.. I'll come back for sure ! ",4,2017,02,28
100,Thank you for a wonderfull stay,The sevice was excelent .i cant tell enough peple how good the hotel areana was on our stay .from the drinks in the bar to room and the hotel excelent .we hope to be back next year when the extension is finished.the shower was the best i have ever been in in my life .thanks for a wonderfull stay ,5,2017,02,28
100,Absolutely Wonderful,"Stayed for 3-nights celebrating our anniversary/ valentines! Great looking place with amazing grounds right outside the hotel. very plush looking exterior with views of the restaurant which looks lovely. Interior is absolutely wonderfully designed and although there was a bit of work going on (which you don't notice at all unless walking through) it nonetheless looked so nice! Asked for split level standard room which was given (they are very accommodating) and boy was it nice! Bathroom was out of this world! lovely reception room downstairs and spacious bedroom upstairs. Decor was fantastic and we were even surprised by roses, chocolate and bubbly for our arrival! 10/10 would recommend and stay again! It's just on the outer ring of canals and can access town easily by tram. We walked most of the time and its only a 20 min walk to the centre. Right around the corner from the zoo also. Best sleep I've had in a LONG time I must add and I have insomnia!",5,2017,02,28
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam... EXCELLENT,"Love this hotel. Very clean, friendly staff, room was awesome(great price for everything they offered in the room), location not to far from the action(7min bus ride). This place is awesome! Really cozy, upscale hotel. I will be back for sure!",5,2017,02,27
100,A Gem in the Park,"The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing,

They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online.
This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town.
It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too, I would highly recommend.",5,2017,02,27
100,Weekend in Amsterdam,"Good location on the outskirts of the city centre with tram stops nearby over canal bridge or at the end of the park. Excellent views from bar/restaurant area overlooking the park. Excellent service by staff. Room was a little too small and the shower was a bit hit and miss trying to get the correct temperature. Breakfast was excellent, with a good selection on offer. My only disappointment was with the sausages as I do like mine 'browned'. Would stay here again if I was to visit Amsterdam again.",4,2017,02,27
100,Nice holiday with young family,"Verry good hotel with perfect atmosphere and location to centre, the park and Artis. Personell helpfull and the rooms are luxary and charming. Our little boy liked the hotel a lot. Next time we will use this hotel for sure again!",5,2017,02,27
100,Top location,Location excellent. Tram to centre just round the corner. Avoided noise and bustle of crowds and next to very pleasant park. Despite renovation work felt comfortable. Staff were really friendly and helpful. ,4,2017,02,27
100,OK but so far off being a great hotel,"We were very disappointed by the room (very noisy & some technical issues: TV, boiler, ... Weren't working)  
The staff has been aware of those issues , they did change the boiler but still not working as the issue must have been electrical...)",3,2017,02,27
100,Ayesha,"Fantastic hotel 
Love the location, love the interior even though the under construction it was very quiet. Breakfast well worth it.
Staff very friendly and informative. Short walk from central Amsterdam ",5,2017,02,26
100,Gorgeous Hotel,"Hotel arena was perfect in all ways!! The staff on the front desks at check in and in the park restaurant where all friendly and happy to help with any questions we had. The room was gorgeous, clean and huge!! The bed was the most comfiest bed i have ever slept on and a lovely clean shower room. The hotel is in a lovely local area and close to trams and metro stations, a great location! Me and my partner loved relaxing by the fire in the restruant/bar area in the evenings after sightseeing and being on our feet all day with a nice cold beer! ",5,2017,02,26
100,Lovely stay as always,"Our 4th visit to hotel arena. It's a classy stay, perfect location as it's away from the main busy areas, but only a 10 min walk to gey into town. Amazing rooms, lovely new hotel entrance through the park. ",5,2017,02,26
100,Hotel east Amsterdam good,"Worth our money and in the park 🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌹🌹🌹🌷
The park was lovely to work out to in the morning although the traffic noise was a bit loud for us .
I would go there again and enjoy the east side of Amsterdam ",5,2017,02,26
100,Truly amazing!,"Such a beautiful hotel staffed with amazing, helpful and extremely friendly staff. The room was beautiful and felt like a 'home away from home'. The service is excellent. I cannot wait to come back here on my next visit! We love Hotel Arena!",5,2017,02,25
100,"No Service, Frontdesk not helpful, not 100% clean","no servie, no refunds. housekeeping came in twice on checkout day even a late checkout was included. frontdesk was not supporting. heating was not controlable. it was very hot. walls were dirty. remote control was sticky and dusty. tv channels werent showing clear. loud doors and construction work. it was hard to relax and get sleep.",3,2017,02,25
100,Only problems & no towels.,"Room was uncomfortable. Some days there were No towels in the room, we had to ask for them every day.  The bathroom floor and shower floor was slippery and we needed a floor mat which we were not given. One day the bed was not made and the the room was not cleaned, the bedside lamp didn't work and there was a stinking smell around reception area.",1,2017,02,25
100,Room for improvement,"Situated in a lovely park, our first impression was 'wow!' this is a beautiful place and ain't we lucky to stay here for a whole week!

Slowly though, we started to encounter little problems. The first one was our room. What they call split level, is one room as you go in and very, very steep stairs to the bed, with  nowhere to hold onto! We flatly refused to stay here and luckily we were moved to a 'normal' room.  

The next morning, we find that the water from the shower was either too hot or too cold. It was impossible to find a balance. We complained at the reception for two consecutive mornings, but whoever tried to fix it, seems to have not been successful at all. So for a whole week we struggled to have a shower, let alone a relaxing one. 

Another incident was returning in the evening after a day out and not finding a single towel in the room. We called reception to advise them of this, but nobody decided to turn up. The next morning we called them again and this time the towels were delivered within 15 minutes.

On new year's eve in the evening, we sat in their beautiful cafeteria/wine bar space after a lovely day out in the city. We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for some food. We were told that no food was being served because the kitchen was very busy with the restaurant. We therefore asked if we have at least 1 serving similar to what was being served in the restaurant, in order not to cause more work for the kitchen staff, but the answer was a straight no. The chef would not accept. Desperately hungry, we asked if we could have some bread and butter at least (!!) ... we got 2 (not 3 or 4 or 5, but 2) small buns and were charged Euro 3.50 for them. The hotel is not that central to just pop out and buy food, especially at 11pm on new year's eve. So off to bed we went, hungry and disappointed. Happy new year to us.",2,2017,02,24
100,paying each time apart,"My credit card had already payed in front the chamber. Whe we arrived i had to pay immediately € 1,85 toeristfee, in the evening i had to pay apart the dineer and in the morning i had to pay the expensive garage. Unbelieveble clumsy 
",3,2017,02,24
100,I love this place,"I've been here countless times despite the building works, but they are almost finished and it's a great transformation and the staff are charming, efficient and very accommodating. The rooms are big, lots of style choice and the bathrooms have hot water!",5,2017,02,24
100,"going back in time,  historical beautiful building, modern convenience","Nothing is to much for the people at front desc. Cheerful, friendely and helpfull.
A special place to stay, it used to be an orphenage and lies in the middle of Amsterdam, with the entrance in the parc!  I felt like a queen in a palace, such beauty, space and view. If you need to stay in a city but want some rest too, this is the place to be! Food and drinks that garantees you to enjoy every minute of the day.",5,2017,02,23
100,Fab Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights for a city break. A great base outside of the centre and easy to get in via tram. Lovely split-level room, great facilities ands wonderful, comfy bed. 

We had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent - delicious food and wine! 

Renovations going on but made no difference to our stay. 

As others have said, the walls are thin but if you have good neighbours it's not an issue.

Overall, an excellent hotel and a great trip to Amsterdam. ",5,2017,02,23
100,A good place,We have a good experience in this hotel and  city. It's a cosy hotel and every places are Clean. You can eat good and sleep perfect because it's very confortable. If you need something you only have to ask for your question and quickly you have a solution. ,4,2017,02,23
100,our stay,"Hotel Arena is very beautiful, it's literally in a big and green park. It's under renovation so it doesn't look so good. We have a good time there, workers on the hotel are nice.
I wouldn't repeat my stay because the room was dirty, the bathroom was a mess and the stairs were mortal.",3,2017,02,22
100,Long weekend stay with friend,Second time visiting Amsterdam - this time with my best friend. First impressions of the hotel were amazing! It was under renovation but this didn't affect our stay. The staff were lovely/helpful and the room was insane - modern décor and 10/10 cleanliness. It was a fair distance to travel to the centre but there are tram stops/metro down the road (half an hour if walking directly to the centre). Would highly recommend and will stay here again in future. Love Dam!!,5,2017,02,22
100,"Excellent hotel, but not what I would class as 4*. ","Such a beautiful hotel, outer building is gorgeous and has a story to it. Renovation currently going on so a lot of make shift corridors and receptions etc but will be amazing once done. Staff were friendly and polite. Helpful when asked, which suits us. The rooms were magnificent. High ceilings and two floors, which was great. It is also perfectly located near to trams and the metro. Excellent hotel. 
The reason I say I wouldn't class it as a 4* - everything within the rooms was cheap. Plastic cups, worn away sofa's and flooring. The rooms were very basic to say the least. No mini bar or stocked fridge, ours was actually broken. 
Luckily we got ours on a great deal on secret escapes, so for the price we paid we got an excellent deal... for anyone paying full price I would suggest looking at a different 4*! ",4,2017,02,21
100,"very beautyful, but...","We absolutely loved the style, the furniture and the overall look of the Hotel and our room. 
We just were not too happy about the fact that you can hear absolutely every noise your neighbors make.
Furthermore the bathroom was not perfectly clean and completely surrounded by glass walls (very pretty but not so practical).  Apart from that we really enjoyed our stay.  
 ",3,2017,02,21
100,Boutique/Hipster hotel to feel like a local,Hotel arena is fantastic. We've been twice. Both times it's been under renovation but this 2nd time they've made some massive changes. Love the decor. Bar is great. Overall hotel fantastic. Nice walk to town too. ,5,2017,02,21
100,Charming Hotel,"Very nice hotel with all different cozy rooms and very very friendly stuff.
The old building with spesial arcitecture and modern Nice restaurant , fireplace ,3 stops  to centrum and beautiful park infront makes  Hotel Arena attractive to us.

100,Couple Long Weekend - BRILLIANT!,"Long weekend for myself and girlfriend (early-late twenties).

We were kindly upgraded on arrival from a standard double to a studio. Great to start off the holiday.
The room was clean and large. The staff were friendly and helpful. The setting and location was brilliant (yes a 20-30 min walk into ""centre"" but it was nice to stop off at bars and look at the sights as we walked. We could have got a taxi or tram but chose not to).
Could not think of any negatives about the hotel, but if I had to then I would say that the main road to the side of the hotel was a little bit noisy and that the halls are dark - but neither of these would stop us from going again. Highly recommendable and perfect for a long or short break in Amsterdam. ",4,2017,02,21
100,Amazing stay!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for his birthday. The room we stayed in was a standard but more like a studio! Staff were all so lovely and helpful. For an extra 30 euro they decorated the room with balloons 2 bottles of procecco and a birthday cake! Breakfast was great and wasn't too far from Dam square, would definitely recommend and we will definitely be back!!",5,2017,02,21
100,Very promissing,"Although they were rebuilding the hotel we had a very nice stay. And from the things I've seen so far, it looks very promising. Our room was very modern and clean. Very good and big bed. The location is great. I think that once it's finished it will be the place to be. We'll sure be back one day. ",3,2017,02,21
100,"The room wasn't clean !  We found garbage from customers before, and the room wasn't cleaned the second day","The room wasn't clean !  We found garbage from customers before (and we arrived at 10 pm so they had All the day for cleaning), the room wasn't cleaned the second day also ! 
The personnal was very helpful 
The hotel is far from the centrum or amsterdam",1,2017,02,20
100,Nice hotel in Amsterdam,"A nice hotel on the edge of a beautiful park.  The rooms are modern but ours was too small for a double room.  Very tight space.

The staff were helpful but were not that insterested in helping with our booking query.",4,2017,02,20
100,Excellent Hotel,We had a brilliant time in this beautiful hotel with its kind Staff and its great location. Thank you very much. We will be happy to recommend it to anyone and we are looking forward to come back soon!,5,2017,02,20
100,Great place for a city break.," This hotel is in a beautiful location of the edge of the park. It was being upgraded while we were there but this did not detract from our experience. Close to the Metro  and the tram it was convenient for getting in to the city centre. The local markets is a great place to browse. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable and prepared to go out of their way to help us. it was particularly nice to be able to drop off our cases at reception before our rooms were ready and also to leave them as we had a late departure. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,20
100,Amazing Hotel,"Spent 4 nights between the 13th and 16th of feb. Amazing hotel, really enjoyed the food that was available in the resteraunt. Hotel looks great on the inside as well as outside. Very picturesque hotel and loved the oosterpark that was on its front doorstep. Not too far from metro/tram, found the staff very helpful and they answered any queries i had. Will definetly visit the city again and hopefully stay at the same hotel ",5,2017,02,19
100,ICE COLD,"Very friendly staff, but the hotel itself is only acceptable during summer. It was cold all over the place. The room had a far too tiny radiator, the air condition was not able to warm up the room but made the air very dry. The quality of the breakfast was poor. I'm just glad that the personnel was ambitious, helpful and very friendly.",2,2017,02,19
100,Nice and cosy Hotel in a park,"welcoming and friendly staff 
good service level
nice and spacious room
Good location in Amsterdam 
nice and cosy ambiance 
located in a park
Did not stay long enough to give tips on Amsterdam
I can recommend this hotel",5,2017,02,19
100,First timer Amsterdamers,"Hotel staff helpful friendly appraochable. Surroundings stunning and beautiful for walks and bikes alike. Great setting for a wedding, anniversary or just relaxing. Great shopping, great food, fabulous people. Will come again....Downfall the renovations but it was not too disruptive. So well done guys👍🏼",4,2017,02,19
100,Things aren't always what they seem,"I booked Hotel Arena based on the guest reviews on trip advisor, the aesthetically pleasing photo's provided and its 4 star ratings.This was sadly not the case when we stepped into our room, where we were shocked at how constricted the space was. We were also shocked to find that our white bathroom sink had a huge stain within it. A very messy issue we faced was the water in the showers kept overflowing which became annoying to keep cleaning up. Another issue was when we opened up the curtains in the morning, we realised how little attention the cleaners payed to dusting the window sill, as there was a lot of dust and wood debris left behind.
Out of frustration we decided to notify one of the receptionists at the front desk in hopes of maybe a change in room, but all she told us was that ""she would get the cleaners to look into it"" and offered us complimentary drinks. 
The only aspect of the hotel that we were thoroughly satisfied with was the helpful suggestions recieved from Sanders and Kareem, who were very humble and friendly and took they're time to listen to us and help us out with all our questions.  Sanders in particular took his time to get to know us and gave us very helpful suggestions, which was the best guest service we have recieved by far on our travels. Thank you guys!",3,2017,02,19
100,Amazing Valentines Stay at Hotel Arena with great breakfast!,"What a beautiful place to stay, it started whilst walking into the park where the hotel is located. A fantastic serene place in a busy city. The restaurant is located at the front with a very natural feel making use of a lot of wood, plants and flowers. Apparently the hotel is refurbishing a bit, but we did not sense disturbance of any kind. When checking in the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the city and you could ask them anything!! Also they left us a small bottle of Prosecco and some chocolates because of our romantic getaway. What a great hotel and even better staff!! We'll be back for sure!",5,2017,02,18
100,Hotel not finished,"I don't normally write reviews but having got back I thought I had to.

Firstly the positives. The staff were helpful and nice, the bar/restaurant was lovely and the park that it is in is a nice setting.

However the reason I gave one star is the amount of of things that went wrong. From looking back at reviews it seems that building work has been going on forever. This does spoil both the outside and inside of the hotel.

When we went to our first room we found that the sofa was dirty, a chunk was missing from the inside of the door panel and the velux window was broken and couldn't shut. It must have been broken a while because the paint had flaked and the plasterboard was breaking from weather damage. A handyperson tried to fix it leading to chunks of plasterboard falling off, to the point it was like a comedy show. We were then moved to a larger room as an upgrade.

This room was better but again the sofa was dirty, the curtains dirty and the windows blocked by scaffolding. Builders than woke us up at 9am the next day. Why would they have to start so early outside our room.

The second night was terrible as the radiator in the bathroom started thumping against the wall! I turned it off but it still happened a couple more times throughout the night. This kind of spooked us out a bit and I agree with another reviewer that the hotel is a bit spooky in general. The corridors for the rooms are dim and the building is old with very high ceilings. With the radiator clanging and pipe work creaking we didn't sleep well at all.

I feel bad giving this review as the staff were great. But have to say while I loved the trip the hotel was possibly the strangest holiday location I have ever been to. It will be better when the hotel is finished but I wouldn't go back again.",1,2017,02,18
100,"Great value, difficult location","Got a great deal on the room no complaints. However, the location was hard to get to centre and would require a lot of Uber's in order to get to and from the centre. The two floor rooms were great and the size of the rooms are excellent",4,2017,02,18
100,Highly recommend! Beautiful,"Had the most amazing time whilst staying at hotel arena 
Such helpful friendly staff and a trendy beautiful hotel located on a park a great location. Perfect distance from the centre! 
We had  valentines breakfast which was very tasty ",4,2017,02,17
100,Best Hotel to stay in Amsterdam,"Very well located, central, in the nature, peaceful and calm place. It is a special place to stay.
People are very nice, attentive, warm and make everything to make you feel good. The restaurant really nice decorated and delicious. 
It was a great stay. Hardly recommended.",5,2017,02,17
100,Not clean!!,"I am writing this review whilst still at the hotel.  My daughter and I booked a four night stay at this hotel as we are travelling around Europe.   I am quite surprised how hotel are given ratings, we booked this Hotel Arena as it is rated as a 4 star but as we entered our room we were surprised, the room is tiny or squished I should say, has only one bedside table for two single beds.  The bathroom looks renovated but it seems like they have forgotten to do something to the washbasin, it was filthy, stained and grime on the sides.  I complained about the dirty washbasin to the staff...they apologised and offered a complimentary drink voucher and said they the will get the cleaners to work on it but when we got back at the end of the day it looked the same, see picture below.

On the whole the hotel is located in a Park, very beautiful, staff are friendly and courteous.  Sadly the room we we are staying does not match the experience we have had at our other hotels in Barcelona, Sevilla, Granada, Belgium.",2,2017,02,17
100,Great hotel- not for sleeping!,"By day this hotel sits in front of a beautiful lake in a park, by night the twinkle of lights and glass fronts entice you into a scrumptious hotel restaurant. The restaurant has an industrial feel, modern and full of greenery. The staff throughout the hotel are friendly. The rooms are clean and light too. However it is undergoing construction for an extension and refurb and the builders set to work at 6am with their drills and hammers! Whilst anxiously awaiting this early
morning wake up call, unfortunately the nights for us were also filled with people slamming doors, stomping through corridors and partying until mid morning. I would give this place 6 months and then definitely recommend a visit. ",3,2017,02,16
100,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay, fab hotel. Short walk to metro/ trams into city. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Only downside the rooms advertised on secret escapes were the bigger split level rooms with feature baths, we were given a basic small room- but this wasn't an issue as it was still a lovely room. Only complaint would be no mirror over dressing table & a €5 additional charge for room service.",4,2017,02,16
100,Amazing hotel!,"Had an amazing stay, the room was fantastic! Would recommend the hotel and would stay there again. Was a little out of the way but was a nice walk to Dam square. Great service. A bit of building work going on but this didn't affect our stay",5,2017,02,16
100,"Great Setting, Good Food, Unique Rooms","Great renovated hotel, love the decor and the way the rooms are laid out. The upstairs downstairs thing is very comfortable and friendly, and gives a unique touch to the rooms, bedroom was that, downstairs is great hotel office.

The restaurant is fairly priced and food is great.

Recommend!",5,2017,02,15
100,Solo Yank in Amsterdam,"Fantastic facility in the process of being renovated and expanded. Quiet rooms, attentive service, with a very good restaurant/bar. Front door opens to a beautiful and safe park, in a nice neighborhood. Would stay here, again!",5,2017,02,15
100,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel

Great hotel , lovely setting with the bar and resteraunt facing on to the park , still areas being worked on when we were there but this did not interfere with our trip . Helpful staff . We would come back ",5,2017,02,14
100,The same City but not the Hotel again!,"nice offer found in the www, but suddenly we have to realise, that was not what we expected. the service was ok, if we found someone who wanted to help us. we got a dirty room with and i  felt living on a building site, because there is still a lot to do and you can see it if you are there, the photos on the net are taken very advantageous!",2,2017,02,13
100,Great Stay - great location,Arrived at the hotel a little earlier than check-in states but this wasn't a problem and we were able to book in early and get to our room to freshen up.  Room was lovely and clean but as a tip has very steep stairs to the sleeping area - not good if you have a joint problem!  Bed was huge and so comfy - lots of refurbishment going on but didn't affect us as we couldn't hear anything..  Hotel will be fantastic when finished.  Great location in the park and we had a lovely walk through the park and found a fantastic local café for breakfast - we chose not to eat in the hotel so that we would be sure to get up and about early in the day.  Hotel staff were all very helpful and happy to provide lots of local information re travel etc.  All in all a very good experience - only downside was the shuttle to and from the airport but this had nothing to do with the hotel I am sure!,4,2017,02,13
100,Very good but needs a few touches,"The place is going through a refurbish which from the looks of what is done will be an excellent finish. The restaurant is lovely and the evening food beautiful. Staff where very friendly. The view amazing. The only let downs where the second floor lobby needs a makeover, might be done in the refurb. Though i like the finish the corridors are incredibly dark even in the day. The room we were in was lovely being in the eaves and the beams were great. However due to a beam and bed placement you could only get in and out oneside of the bed. The bathroom is a black glass box which looks elegant, but i found the glass seperating the shower from the rest of the wetroom too small and i soaked the toilet in the process. Also their was only a cupboard to hang clothes and no drawers to put smalls. All in all an excellent hotel with beautiful design.",4,2017,02,12
100,Very nice,"For my birthday I booked a standard room for 1 night just to get away from day to day life with my girlfriend. We decided to book this hotel due to a nice offer we found online and the look and feel it gave us. The photo's on the site are an accurate depiction of the comfort and class of this hotel. Upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite on the top floor and it was everyrhing we hoped for. The suite was large, the bed comfortable and anything we needed/wanted was there or made available to us. The bathroom could've used a little more attention in terms of cleaning but overall we had an amazing night. I highly recommend this establishment, especially due to it's amazing staff and extremely nice location in the heart of an exciting and amazing city on the edge of the Oosterpark. ",4,2017,02,12
100,Interesting building in good location,"I was here in snowing winter. Hotel is being renovated so it is a bit messy. Nice staff and efficient check in/out routines. Unusual room with a sitting area (desk, TV and chairs) up a narrow staircase. Very comfortable beds and small but nice bathroom. We had breakfast in the  fancy restaurant overlooking the park. Hotel very well situated for our purpose and the building has an interesting history.",4,2017,02,12
100,A wonderful break,"We had the most wonderful time at Hotel Arena. The staff are fabulous, the hotel is beautiful and in a great location and the food is superb. We can't wait to go back, it will be great to see what it's like once all the building work is completed. (The works did not affect our stay at all) ",5,2017,02,11
100,Cant wait to go back,"We loved the hotel. All staff couldn't do enough for us. The room was amazing, clean and big. The hotel was set in a beautiful park with easy access to trams. The hotel staff gave us recommendations for places to eat. We can't wait to go back. Thank you to all staff",5,2017,02,11
100,Amazing stay!,"Really lovely stay at Hotel Arena. Had a standard double room. The room was double floored with the bathroom, sofa with TV and desk down stairs and big comfy double bed up stairs!
An interesting and easy 25-30 minute walk into the main parts of the city.
The building works that were going on didn't affect us at all. Would recommend! ",5,2017,02,10
100,Excellent,"Hotel was outstanding.
Room and service were outstanding.. but deceiving whilst booking as to the room size, we were expecting a large group room with a bath but instead got an attic room with a shower. Still a beautiful place to stay ",5,2017,02,10
100,what an amazing place,"The building its self was outstanding and there is no other way to describe it. I liked how even though they had up dated the hotel it still had the old characteristics. I was amazed when I first walked up to the building. The location was great, not too far from the centre. I would recommend this hotel and will definetly visit again. Lovely rooms and staff. ",5,2017,02,09
100,Living the life of luxury,"We had a fantastic short break at Hotel Arena. The hotel is still going through renovations but we wouldn't have known anything about it once inside. Such a nice touch walking through the park to the entrance of the hotel.

We arrived before check-in time but we were shown through to reception by the host no questions asked, we were then effortlessly taken through the check in process and our bags stored securely until we returned later in the day. The gentleman on reception ran through some areas with us on the complimentary map giving us directions to the closest tram stops. 

We had a meal in the restaurant the first night, it was just what we needed after exploring out in the cold. 

Throughout our trip we were always welcomed with a smile and hello.

Our room was so lovely i seriously thought that they had got our reservation mixed up. From the huge window with streaming but relaxing light, the stylish furniture and the huge bed, it was nicer than home from home.

The location is also fabulous, just a ten minute walk to the tram and at the edge of the park there's always gorgeous surroundings for a stroll. 

If we visit Amsterdam again i would definitely book Hotel Arena again.",5,2017,02,09
100,Great hospitality!!!,"We stayed for a few days in January & we definately want to come back in our next trip.
The hotel is very close to the city center & it seems to be renewed. Breakfast was served in their beautiful restaurant & we found a great variety of food.
Our room was quite with a spacious bathroom ,styled in a minimal way which was cosy too. The staff was very friendly & helpful with their recommendations about how to spend our days there.
Thank you all for being so professional!!!",5,2017,02,09
100,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed in this hotel for couple of days in my trip to Amsterdam along with family.It is a great place to stay.The service and staff are really nice.The hotel is nicely situated and room arrangement is really awesome.,5,2017,02,09
100,Not bad. Could be a lot better with not a lot of effort.,"Stayed one evening whilst on business. Rate was extortionate, but reflected the general occupancy rates in Amsterdam during a busy conference week, so expected.

However... 

There was no mention of a refurbishment project on the booking info. There are unfinished areas, blocked off areas, cables hanging from walls in places etc. Not major, but a bit annoying considering price paid (£220)

Room was interesting, bed comfy. It was very cold though, as the heating / air conditioning is activated by the keycard holder, And the pipe radiator was switched off - I assume to conserve energy. There should be some means of maintaining a minimum temperature in a non occupied room - or at least a way to pre heat the room before a guest arrives. It is not acceptable to expect a guest to sit in a room whilst it warms up. 

The room was in absolute darkness when I arrived. I had to feel about the room to find the keycard slot, which is interlocked with the light system. The key slot should be illuminated. 

There was no heating in the bathroom, when it is -2 outside this is not acceptable. 

The bathroom wall is glass. I had to drape a towel over the bathroom mirror light, as the only way to turn it off was to remove the keycard - which turned the heating off. Obviously a fire risk, but necessary in order to sleep. 

I am not sure if these little annoyances apply to every room or every floor. I was in room 231.

Breakfast distinctly average. No bread or bread rolls except for the stuff people toast. 

Fawlty towers rating: 3/5",3,2017,02,09
100,Jane,"Four night stay to visit daughter. Staff extremely polite, friendly and efficient. Breakfast and dinner superb. Trams stopped nearby and short journey to centre and museums. Lovely views of the park from the restaurant. ",5,2017,02,09
100,Excellent hotel,"Wonderful stay at this hotel. Location was absolutly beautiful, not too far from the centre of Amsterdam but in a lovely park. The staff were polite and accommodating to us, giving us lots of advice about where to go and how. The room was incredible, very clean with a comfy bed. Highly recommend! ",5,2017,02,09
100,Really cool location near the center,"This hotel has a really cool character. Loved everything. It is a mix from old a new inside... i really enjoyed it. The breakfast is great, really good quality! You should take it. And also the restaurant ""park"" is a cozy nice place, nice for having a coffee before you go to the city. 
I would like to specially mention a guy named Dino at the restaurant/ bar. He is such a great guy, made my day! Big big thumbs up! 
The hotel is at a good location, the metro station is near.
I will book here again, the quality, location, price was right for me.",5,2017,02,09
100,Great place,Great place great value nicely situated; a walk away from the centre some nice places around east. Hotel was currently being returbed but the front looked nice and a really nice vibe in the front bar. Highly recommend ,5,2017,02,07
100,Beautiful Hotel with high Service Level,"I had a fantastic stay at Hotel Arena. The Staff was very friendly at any Time and the Front Desk was very welcoming! The room was great and very tidy. In the evening i had a little surprise up my room, a bottle of Prosecco, because of my Birthday! That was such a wow Moment of Service! I would stay at this Place at any Time when I'm back in Amsterdam. The Hotel is in a really great Area you reach everything easily with Public transportation. It was a really awesome stay. And by the way- the bed was very, very comfy! ",5,2017,02,07
100,Shorttrip to Amsterdam,"Beautiful hotel.
Superb location.
But thin walls.
We had a great stay there.
The service was very friendly and efficient.
Even before our stay , I've had a very personal conversation about some difficulties of our stay . The were answered very quick and flexible.
Thanks for that.",4,2017,02,07
100,Loved it,"Our stay at the hotel was lovely. Very nice with a new modern feel but within a old building. It gave you everything you wanted, service was brilliant. At the time of our stay they had building works but it never effected us. The plans for the new works will make the hotel even better, the site is massive and if it's up to the same  standard throughout I would come and stay again to find out how it turns out.",5,2017,02,07
100,50th birthday ,"We stayed here for my partners 50th birthday from 26/01/17-29/01/17.
Hotel is very clean, rooms were very clean, well presented, staff are really helpful.
We had a meal in the restaurant on the last night which was also very nice.
Only advice to people would be make sure you get a map of the area which the staff on reception gave us and tram tickets that last for a few days as it's quite away out from the centre.",5,2017,02,07
100,Amazing couples weekend,"Very grand hotel with a 21st century interior. Staff were very welcoming on arrival and were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the surrounding area, great advice for recommendations.
Room was clean and spacious with a comfortable king size bed and a huge wet room bathroom. The only slight downsides were that the wet room did not drain properly so there was a small bit of water near the sink and toilet, and there was no plug for straighteners next to a mirror. Apart from that everything was excellent.
Great hotel for a couples weekend away, situated in a lovely quiet area not far from the city centre, lovely bars and restaurants close by. Easy access to trams through the park or on the main street will get you to the centre in 10 minutes. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,02,06
100,4.5 out of 5,"Enjoyable stay, good location from centre without being in the heart of things but within walking distance which was enjoyable so as to take in the culture and the architecture and amazing features,we had a rally amazing stay and finished our last nite with a meal at the restaurant which was of a very high standard.",4,2017,02,06
100,Amazing Hotel,"Hotel was amazing, modern, great food at the restaurant, walking distance to the main attractions in Amsterdam. We did not want to stay in a hostel so we opted for a nicer hotel. The hotel is an older building with hallways leading all over the hotel. the room was great large enough for two people, had a sitting area with a sofa. would recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel is also going through some construction which we were unaware of when booking the hotel. It did not bug us too much as we weren't there during the day. The hotel offered complimentary drinks for guests during the construction. Once the hotel is completed it will look really nice and a good mix between old style and modern.",5,2017,02,06
100,Great service in a great location!,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Arena and I absolute loved it! The reason we booked this hotel was because of its central location, but that was certainly not the only benefit that we experienced. The staff were brilliant, always going out of their way to make our stay very memorable. I loved the room, it was very modern yet classy and very clean. We also stayed at their restaurant, food was very good. We will certainly come back!",5,2017,02,06
100,Birthday weekend away,"Fantastic hotel, great facilities, friendly and helpful staff, beautiful and clean. Would suggest using buses  trams or bikes to get to centre though as it is about half hour walk if you know your way.",4,2017,02,06
100,We liked it,"Very nice hotel. nice spaces. we got a room upgrade as well. we will come back.
The new Park restaurant is nice to. Just the buffet of the breakfast was not was we aspect for a hotel like Arena. The entrance of the hotel is hidden. even the taxi driver could't find it. But when you know where to go one appreciate the big park in front of the hotel.",4,2017,02,06
100,GREAT SERVICE!,"I am glad I had the chance to stay in this hotel during my vacations in Amsterdam.

My experience was great because of the exceptional service provided by the staff. They were always smiling and eager to help you.

I hope we get to visit again.",5,2017,02,05

100,Gorgeous hotel with great service,"I had the chance to stay at Hotel Arena for a couple of nights and I must say everything was impecable. There were some events happening on those days but they did not bother us with the noise. We had breakfast and dinner at the restaurant several times and the food was delicious.

Same goes for the reception staff, they were very welcoming and took me to my room which was super nice and had a quircky style. 
Would definitely come back to Hotel Arena and i highly recommend it.",5,2017,02,03
100,Amazing on the outside,"First appearances of the hotel was outstanding. And even first impressions of room was good. However the bed being up the most dangerous stairs proved to be a nightmare especially if u wake up through the night and have to stumble to the bathroom in the dark down the stairs! Room wasn't the cleanest although there is maid service each day they tend to just make your bed and pick towels up. Floors where dirty where you could feel bits under your feet. As bed was on the top of the room it tends to get really hot of an evening and there is no air conditioning. 
Nice hotel nice restaurant but rooms not the best. ",3,2017,02,02

100,Not so good,"The shower was not working properly, so the badroom flooded.
There were holes on the curtain and a dead insect on the wall. They fixed these things but they never refilled the shampoo in the bathroom, eventhough we had to ask for it. There was no shampoo during our entire stay.
 Not good quality for a 4 star hotel.",3,2017,01,30

It's located within walking distance to tram and metro links and overall I am very glad I chose to stay in this lovely hotel, will definitely be returning soon! ",5,2017,01,29
100,The best hotel in Amsterdam!,"Having stayed at various hotels in Amsterdam over the years we were truly wowed by hotel arena. Large clean and beautiful rooms, friendly efficient staff, stunning hotel and park and the new bar/restaurant was superb and exactly what we needed for a drink after a day out and about. We were checked in within a minute, given a free drinks voucher for the bar and upon returning to our room was surprised with a bottle of bubbly and a card to celebrate upcoming birthday (wasn't even whilst we were away!) I won't spoil the surprise for you but you are given a fab gift on check out also! Will 100% be back. I wouldn't stay anywhere else now! 
Thanks Hotel Arena for a memorable stay! ",5,2017,01,29
100,Can't fault one bit.,"Hotel arena is perfect for everyone! Me and my partner age 19-20 stayed here for 4 nights. We wanted to be close to the center but not bang in the middle. The hotel is about a 30 min walk from Amsterdam center. Or 5 min from the nearest tram which will get you there in 10-15 mins. The location of the hotel itself is beautiful. Just round the corner from the artis zoo. We walked to the Heineken experience from the hotel this took us 20 mins. The staff are so welcoming and friendly! The website states check in at 3pm our flight landed in Amsterdam at 8:00am by 1:30pm we were shattered so made our way to the hotel. We approached the lovely lady at the desk and she said she would check if our room was ready for us.... and it was!! Which takes me to the part of the extra extra comfy beds!! You just sink into them when you lie down. We had room with twin beds. Which were easily.pushed together. The hotel breakfast was lovely and the fresh orange juice they do is to die for! Construction work is going on at the minute but doesn't start till 8:30am ish. We only had 4 days here so wanted to be up at that time anyway! But managed sleeping through till 11:00am so just goes to show how little the noise affects you. The construction work has enticed me to go back in the future to see how they have possible made this hotel more beautiful than it already is!! Look forward to seeing you soon

100,Warm and welcoming,"When we arrived outside the hotel we were pleasantly suprised by the picturesque location. Inside the staff were warm and welcoming and all 6 of us received a free drink in the bar.

The rooms were quirky, stylish and well equipped Some refurbishments were going on but they did not affect our stay. ",4,2017,01,28
100,Amazing!,"I will most definitely stay at Hotel Arena the next time I am in Amsterdam. The rooms are amazing, cozy and classy. I always looked forward to going back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing. Excellent ",5,2017,01,28
100,Lovely hotel with great front of house staff but poor dinner and restaurant service.,"I stayed in this hotel with my partner 23rd-26th January. I found the travel advice on their website before we came and this was particularly useful and saved me spending a fortune on taxi transfers as the tram/metro/bus pass was so cheap and travel was easy. I'd booked this hotel online as a surprise trip away for my partners birthday. We arrived late at the hotel and the front desk service was excellent. Lots of recommendations on places to go whilst in Amsterdam. The staff provided us with maps and marked out all the places they recommended we went to. As it was my partners birthday we had a room upgrade and the front desk staff brought balloons up to the room to wish him a happy birthday-a lovely thoughtful touch. The room was gorgeous and a great size. Cleanliness was generally great with the exception of the bath. This hadn't been swilled out so I doubt that had been cleaned. Room service came daily and replaced towels. The only problem with the room (we stayed in 263) was that sound proofing was awful. I woke up one morning thinking someone had come into our room. You could hear conversations word perfect from people that weren't in our room. 

We decided to have dinner in the hotel on my partners birthday and it was pretty awful. As we approached the bar the barman looked at us and then went and did something else before coming to serve us so we were stood waiting a while. We thought this was poor. He told us to take a seat and after 10 minutes of sitting there no menu had been bought over to us so I went and asked for one. I was told someone would come to take our order but after another 10 minutes we hadn't even been asked what we wanted to drink. I went to find a waitress and ask if we could place an order. Food was very expensive but we found this to be the case across a lot of restaurants in Amsterdam. There was limited vegetarian options (only 2). The one of which was just roasted vegetables on their own and that was 18 euros which I thought was extortionate! Food quality was poor and tasteless. Restaurant was gorgeous with nice atmosphere but staff were poor as was the food. We didn't eat at the hotel again or go back for drinks. 

Overall lovely hotel with great front of house staff that would go above and beyond and were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming. Poor restaurant food and service and poor sound proofing throughout whole building. I would return to this hotel but I wouldn't eat there.   ",4,2017,01,27
100,The best place ive ever stayed in,"Amazing place we loved every minute of it the room was really nice the bed was the bigger bed ive ever stayed in the showers was nice and big , even the park that it was on was really nice aswell thank you ",5,2017,01,27
100,nice directly at the park,"charming hotel, nice staff. We had a bit of a hassle getting to the rooms as we had a lot of stuff to carry in and out every day. (filmcrew) The entrance of the hotel is not directly where the elevators are and we had to walk quiet a bit. The staff was very helpful though.",4,2017,01,27
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam,"Was a lovely hotel, friendly staff and lovely location in the park. Karim at the hotel reception was very friendly and offered us a free upgrade as our room wasn't ready in time. Excellent customer service from him and I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2017,01,27
100,Cozy newly renovated hotel,"The hotel is conveniently located in the upcoming eastern part of Amsterdam and at the same time really close to most if not all venues in the city. The entrance through the park gives an extra touch to the hotel. The hotel is newly renovated and my room was cozy, spacious with a large bathroom. The breakfast was really good and also the food in the restaurant is quite good. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Overall I had a top notch stay and will book again on my next visit to Amsterdam.",5,2017,01,26
100,Weekend stay,"We had a really great stay, the staff were very helpful and friendly. We had an extra large room which was a quite expensive but worth the extra money. Also extra large rooms are quirky. Hotel is within easy walking distance of the city centre ",4,2017,01,25
100,Great value for money,"The hotel is very well situated, the tram takes you in a couple of minutes to the Leidseplein.

Very nice rooms and great breakfast, also a good restaurant.

The staff is friendly and I had a great stay in hotel Arena.",5,2017,01,25
100,Transparent walls to the bathroom,"Some of the Staff was really nice, but some were really rude. The rooms looks nothing like the pictures andre the bathroom hadde transparent walls so everyone in the room could see you onsdag the toilet and in the showe",2,2017,01,25
100,Great hotel!,"Nice hotel, the services and staff were great. There was construction going on, but it didn't seem to be obnoxious. It's a little far from the center of Amsterdam, but has some cute spots for meals and drinks nearby.",4,2017,01,24
100,A really good hotel,"Me and my girlfriend liked this hotel. It is close to a grocery store and the service is excellent.
You can take a walk to the ooster park and the transport is really easy. I suggest this hotel for a long stay to amsterdam... but not for a short stay because you are far from the amsterdam central",5,2017,01,24
100,"Steph,,","Very nice hotel and location,
Once we got to grips with the team lines it was very easy to get around,,
If this hotel lacks anything it's probably some kind of spa facility,after having long days maybe a jacuzzi wouldn't go a miss, 
But overall a lovely stay,",4,2017,01,24
100,Great Stay!,"Lovely staff, lovely room, lovely location, lovely everything.
The room was beautiful and had all we needed for a comfortable and easy stay. The location is good as it's just a short trip into central on the tram and most noteworthy the staff were all so so friendly, helpful and welcoming!",5,2017,01,24
100,Birthday weekend 😝,"Beautiful building with unique history. There is ongoing building work but doesn't start and end at stupid times. Didn't try any of the food. Would definitely stay again, just wish they had paid more attention to the detail and cleanliness as it would really set it apart from other hotels.",4,2017,01,23
100,Pretend to be a 4 store but they can not,"Small room, Our first room was not clean and had no siting area as advertised. No working hairdryer. Shower had no waterpressure. Breakfast very limited choice. Frontdesk responded ok on our complains and gave us a new room. ",2,2017,01,23
100,great hotel & service,"we enjoyed our stay very much. The service was incredible, very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The location is beautiful and the rooms comfortable. We will definitely come back and look very forward to it. ",5,2017,01,23
100,Unusual property and very comfortable,The hotel is being renovated but from the inside you would not know it. A very unusual building that apparently was once an orphanage; the bedrooms are spacious and comfortable - we actually stayed in two because the shower in the first was not draining properly. The staff were delightful and very friendly and helpful. The location is great facing out onto a park - a short tram ride takes you to the centre of the city where museums abound. Breakfast was plentiful and we ate dinner there one night and the quality was excellent. We would definitely return to this hotel if we are able to return to Amsterdam one day....,4,2017,01,23
100,Hotel Arena Amsterdam,"We booked a Standard Room for the two of us. There were no Standard Rooms available when we asked for our key, instead we got a Business Room! This was absolutely fabulous! We had a great stay in your hotel! The bed is also phenomenal + bathroom. It was all lovely. Actually perfect!",5,2017,01,23
100,Great place if you are looking for something original,"The hotel itself was beautiful. The staff were very accommodating and the restaurant facing the park is a highlight. Breakfast could have a bit more options in terms of sliced fruit.
I will most definitely come back and recommend this hotel.   ",5,2017,01,23
100,very nice place,"very nice place. we love it here! so nice location too. The park is so beautifull and the people working on the hotel were so nice, we didnt try the restaurant,. Maybe, next time because the place looked incredible too ",4,2017,01,23
100,Very nice stay,"The hotel is located in a historic house, which was originally a home for children with difficulties. The high ceilings and modern decor make it a special atmosphere. The staff is very kind. The connection to the city center is easy, by public transport almost at the entrance.",4,2017,01,23
100,Gorgeous hotel in a lovely area of Amsterdam,"Hotel Arena is situated in the beautiful Oosterpark, a very quiet and romantic setting for couples and only a few minutes walk from the number 9 and 14 tram stop which will take you straight to Dam square. There is a lot to see and do in the immediate area with many restaurants and bars to explore as well as the park itself.

The Hotel itself is an old converted church that has been modernized and redecorated but it still has a historical and grand feeling to it. The facilities in the rooms were very nice, but if you are going during January as I did, you may find the room a bit cold at times.",5,2017,01,23
100,Quick Visit,"This hotel looks amazing from the outside. It is an old building that opens onto a park. When you walk inside it is quite modern however the decor is dark. We arrived in Amsterdam at about midday and when we checked in we asked the man if there was anything close by to do, as we had only 4 hours left of sunlight. He pointed me to the front of the hotel as there was supposed to be a concierge there. There was no one there and in fact I rarely even saw someone attending the desk. 

Our room was small but okay for a few nights. I don't understand the decor, the bathroom is a glass room so if someone was in the bathroom you can see in! The TV was also right at the edge of the bed, so if you are someone who moves a lot in your sleep then maybe move it. The walls are paper thin and one night we heard the couple next door (use your imagination lol).

The location is outside of the city however it is a short tram ride into town. The restaurant down stairs was nice and you can get it charged to your room as well as get room service if you'd prefer that.",3,2017,01,22
100,Stunning hotel,"We stayed for one night and we really loved it! Beautiful renovated restaurant with amazing views on the park. The room was very comfortable with a clean bathroom and a large bed. The breakfast was of great quality, the staff was very friendly and professional. Overall a fantastic experience!",5,2017,01,22
100,Short break.,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Arena for a couple of nights. 
The hotel was a short car journey away from the airport and was easily accessible. 
Situated in one of the parks, the location of the hotel was perfect! We got to enjoy the less busy parts of the city but we're a short tram ride into the centre of Amsterdam. 
All members of staff were fully welcoming and did everything they could to meet our needs. Any help or guidance that we needed they provided and made our stay even more enjoyable. We would most definetly stay at the hotel again and recommend to anybody! ",5,2017,01,21
100,Excellent,The only real problem was the builders starting work early on Friday outside in the courtyard but otherwise couldn't really fault it. I would stay there again next time it will be three nights to see more of the attractions around Amsterdam.,4,2017,01,21
100,"Very Cool, Comfortable Hotel by Oosterpark","I stayed here for two nights in Amsterdam alone on business, and could not have been happier. The hotel is in a very cool, unusual building overlooking the Oosterpark. Room was extremely comfortable and well decorated. Breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were excellent, although the service was typical Dutch and really lacking compared to typical US service.",4,2017,01,21
100,Wonderful base ,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights on our 1st visit to Amsterdam. 
Throughly enjoyed the hotel , great helpful staff , superb food , very comfortable room .
Ideal tram links to every where we wanted to go 
Will definitely use this hotel again next year 
",5,2017,01,20
100,Amazing hotel,"This is an amazing hotel (renovation still ongoing) with a nice atmosphere and a stunning new lounge/restaurant area with beautiful glass walls and views over the park. The stuff is very professional and friendly, always attentive and willing to help. The room was functional with a great bed and a spacious bathroom. Quality breakfast and food, and last but not least, a historical chapel that is a must see!",5,2017,01,20
100,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights as a couple for my birthday. We booked a standard room and it was lovely, very clean and had everything you needed. After the first night we were awoken at 8:30am by workers drilling, we told reception and were moved into another room. This rooms shower didn't work so they moved us again, the reception workers were so accommodating and this time moved us into a suite, where we spent the 3 nights of our trip. It was, by far, the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. The suite was absolutely amazing and had a bath big enough to swim in. I had coffee and orange just everyday and fruit delivered for brekfast. The cafe / bar is also amazing, we stopped here everyday on our way back from touring the centre for a glass of wine and some snacks. On check out we were given free drinks vouchers again for another free coffee in the bar. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.

The location is perfect too, instead of stayed in dam square and only seeing about 1/4 of Amsterdam, we much preferred staying here and walking everywhere. It took us around 25 minutes to get into the centre but it is a beautiful walk, and we walked to other parts of Amsterdam that you wouldn't usually visit had you stayed bang in the centre. I think these quieter bits of Amsterdam were much nicer, and had beautiful restaurants.

Thank you so much for the best birthday and stay ever.

Enya and Aaron Mccullough ",5,2017,01,20
100,"Beautiful hotel & Amazing restaurant, room unclean on arrival","Their system was down at 7 when we arrived. Staff were very accommodating and provided complimentary drinks and a room upgrade for the inconvenience.
Bed was unclean with hair on arrival, we stripped the bed and the next day the mattress topper was still unclean. The room was frozen however we put this down to last minute upgrade, bathroom was also freezing and wouldn't really heat up at all during the day. Staff made sure the room was warm every day after that. And the room was well checked after we had made it known the bed was unclean.
Restaurant was beautiful and the food was delicious, and the service was great. I would recommend the restaurant itself to any who travel to Amsterdam. 
The hotel is in a beautiful spot and with the trams it's very easy to get around.
There was construction ongoing at the hotel and on the Thursday we were woken by a hammering at 7 am,  there was no warning from hotel staff this might interrupt our sleep and this wasn't very pleasant.
",4,2017,01,20
100,Place to be!,"The location was great, it is placed near to the Central station, which was very convenient for our transportation, furthermore there were plenty of shops/café/bars  around the area, which area to my opinion is the place to be if you are visiting Amsterdam.
Now regarding the hotel itself the rooms were spacious clean and functional with good amenities. I really enjoyed the building of this hotel a renewed historical chapel.
Moreover breakfast presented great variety for every taste and everything seemed fresh and yummy. Another pro is the renovated restaurant with the great loud area, nice food and good wines with normal price comparing the quality it offers. Finally and most important the staff was very friendly and professional. I would definitely be there again!
 ",5,2017,01,20
100,Stunning hotel & good location,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my fiancés birthday and it was well worth every penny spent. We have already said that we would 100% come back to this hotel when we return to Amsterdam in the future. 

We had a deluxe room. The layout was really nice with two floors it felt like we had our own apartment. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. 

The staff were really friendly, particularly the reception staff who allowed us to check into our room early and were really helpful in telling us the nearest hotspots for food. 

We loved our stay and trip to Amsterdam, and hope to be back in the near future.",5,2017,01,19
100,Great hotel,"friendly staff with good knowledge about the city , were always polite and were around to help if any problems happened . ideal location for people that want to be near the city but not actually in the city",5,2017,01,19
100,Viking Mike,Have stayed here several times in the past and with the new renovations (still ongoing)  the view of Oosterpark from the Park Bar & Restaurant with its the new frontage is so relaxing. Look forward to returning again and seeing the completed job.,4,2017,01,19
100,Standard double room,"Everything was amazing I loved it. 

Staff were friendly, the room was on point. I experienced no problems within my stay here, lovely area and it was worth my money. 

I would definitely be coming again!",5,2017,01,18
100,Amsterdam os good :),"The hotel is beautiful and is inside a very nice park, nice clean cozy room. I really liked the clear bathroom the very good care of the hotel staff. The only downside is that it is a 35 minute walk from the center. Which is perfectly managed taking two trams that pass near the hotel you can take a card for several days is quite cheap and you can take metro bus and tram.",4,2017,01,18
100,Amazing place ,"Just home from a 3 night break with my partner , I could not fault the place or the staff in any kind of way , very friendly and helpful with any of our needs , the whole place is spotless from top to bottom , highly recommended ",5,2017,01,16
100,Fahey family,"Loved the hotel, a great experience for all 4 of us. If there is a word for being classy yet a bit different then that's what I would use to describe Arena. The in house dining facility is also first rate and we had a great meal there the night before we left.  ",5,2017,01,16
100,"Host is very kind, good location","We stayed in Hotel Arena in january 2017, the host Sander was very kind, gave us full atention and tips for visiting Amesterdam. The room was nice, modern and clean. The hotel is located near a park and near the tram 7,10 (for rikjsmuseum) and 9, 14 a little foward (for dam) and 500m of metre westerplein.",5,2017,01,16
100,Hotelnacht,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel during Hotelnacht. The room was beautiful and clean. We loved the bathroom! 

Thank you Pieter-Jan and Roos for the great service and making us feel at home right away!",4,2017,01,16
100,Fantastic Hotel,"We booked online through Expedia and got an excellent room rate for our two night stay. The hotel is located outside the city centre, but only a short walk from the nearest tram stop that takes you direct to Dam Square and the railway station (Metro station is a little further away, so tram is recommended from the railway station). The hotel is a converted church, located on the edge of Oosterpark. The entrance is very impressive, and the walk through to reception reveals a very impressive staircase. Our room was located on the ground floor, but split on two levels. The room was comfortable, although storage space was limited with no drawers, just a wardrobe. No complaints though, televisions on both levels, a spacious walk in shower/bathroom. Oosterpark itself is a lovely park, we had a winter setting with snowfall. There is a large lake and keep an eye out for the green parakeets that fly from tree to tree. ",5,2017,01,15
100,Beautiful hotel. Would definitely return,The hotel is so pretty. It's absolutely spotless and the staff were fantastic. A warm welcome by all. I could not find fault. Well done and thank you for a wonderful stay. I would certainly return if we come back to Amsterdam. ,5,2017,01,15
100,"converted from old building and elegantly furnished, beautiful rooms, disappointing solitations","hotel housed in an old building and factory, excellently furnished, elegant, nice rooms and efficient bathrooms , stairs a bit steep and dangerous in rooms with mezzanine, disappointing breakfast rather poor and poor quality",4,2024,07,11
100,Inappropriate price-performance ratio,"Check In would have been 3 a.m. We were given 5:20 a.m. access to our rooms. Apology and offer of compensation only after urgent intervention on our part.
Rooms as duplex, the stairs were extremely short in tread, however, risk of injury tended to be very high.
Technology in the room itself very clear for a junior suite. Tree defects were visible in the open.
Breakfast offer manageable, interesting anecdote, when we left the table to fill our plates, our table was empty, our coffee, tea. But the garbage was still there.
Conclusion: no repetition",2,2024,07,09
100,Absolutely recommended for a relaxing stay in Amsterdam!,"We had a suite room, which was large, super stylish and very quiet - a huge plus point for a city break! One star deducted for the following: We definitely didn't have enough storage space for our fairly large luggage (we were on a tour). In the large room there was only a small closet, half of which was already occupied by an ironing board, iron and safe. Luckily we were able to hide our bags and suitcases behind the bed, so that the room remained visually ""clean"". In addition, the lighting in the bathroom and living area was linked and could not be operated separately. If you went to the bathroom first in the morning, you inevitably had to turn on the full lighting in the sleeping area too.

The room service was great (perfect cleanliness!), and all the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. The extensive breakfast buffet in a beautiful location had something for every taste. We were very impressed by the selection of fresh and healthy foods. (Fruit salad & fresh pineapple/melon/grapefruit, large selection of cereals and dairy products, etc.) 

The location couldn't have been better for us personally: idyllic location in the park and the tram practically on the doorstep! Oosterpark and the surrounding area were ideal for walking, and some sights (e.g. Artis Zoo) were also within walking distance.

We would love to come back :-)

100,Good experience,"Nice hotel inside the Oosterpark, a large park widely used by locals for running, cycling and taking the children to play. The room was clean and well equipped. The distance from the center is quite significant but the area is well served by public transport. The breakfast was excellent although not cheap (€20) but considering the breakfast taken in the centre, it is still worth it. Very friendly and helpful staff. I would stay here again",4,2023,08,06

Für 300 Euro pro Nacht haben wir schon wesentlich besser gewohnt: Unser Zimmer war eine Kaschemme unter dem Dach mit winzigem, total verdrecktem Fenster.

100,Museum mit Übernachtungsmöglichkeit und schlechtem Service,"Beim einchecken wurde behauptet, das Zimmer wäre noch nicht bezahlt. Natürlich war es schon längst vor zwei Wochen über eine Agentur bezahlt und bestätigt. Außerdem mußten wir ein Deposit hinterlegen, ist das heute noch üblich?
Als Zimmer wurde uns ein Zimmer mit Treppe angeboten, allerdings sind die Zimmer mit Treppen so steil, das es für ältere nicht zu empfehlen ist. Deshalb haben wir dann ein normales Zimmer verlangt und auch bekommen.
Insgesamt wirkt das Hotel mit seinen verwinkelten Wegen, Einrichtungen und Räumen, eher wie ein Museum mit Übernachtunsgmöglichkeiten. Keine 4 Sterne gefühlt, Personal unaufmerksam. Auch in der Bar, wurden dort nicht wahr genommen und auch nicht bedient, deshalb haben wir uns an der Rezeption eingedeckt mit Getränken und Snacks, das war ok. Die Handtücher auf dem Boden wurden nicht gewechselt und das Bett auch nicht gemacht, nur Toilettenpapier wurde nach gefüllt. Was soll man davon halten? Keine Weiterempfehlung.",2,2023,04,14

Il lato positivo è che è all'interno di un parco bellissimo quello negativo è che è un pò troppo distante dal centro ( 30 minuti a piedi ). Tutto sommato ci siamo trovati abbastanza bene, se posso dare un consiglio all'hotel cercate di aggiungere personale che parli la lingua italiana, perchè ho visto diversi clienti italiani che, non avendo molta dimestichezza con la lingua inglese non riuscivano a comunicare molto bene, un paio li ho pure aiutati.",4,2022,11,18

Kissen und Wandschoner rochen nach Erbrochenem oder Exkremente. Nach mehrmaligem hinweisen dies zu verbessern brachten mir die Hotelangestellten 4 Kissen aufs Zimmer, 2 davon waren mit 2 verschiedenen Parfums besprayt und die anderen beiden rochen genauso wie jene im Zimmer. Auf dem Boden war schon bei der Ankunft ein schwarzer eingetrockneter Fleck Spucke. Der Zimmerservice hat es in 9 Tage nicht geschafft diesen ganz leicht zu sehenden Fleck zu reinigen.

100,Horrible ubicación. Habitaciones frías y ruidosas. Personal no empatico,El hotel está a 40 minutos andando rápido del centro. Lo primero que hicieron fue cobrarme casi 70€ de fianza e impuestos pero sin darme justificante alguno a pesar de pedirlo 3 veces. La habitación ya estaba previamente pagada y era una suite donde las ventanas eran tan altas que no se veía hacia abajo. Mal cerradas que entraba frío y terriblemente ruidosas por la carretera inmediata. Voy a menudo a Ámsterdam y sin duda ha sido el peor a pesar del lujo de precio pagado,2,2021,08,29

Es fehlen für eine „echte“ 4*-Klassifizierung Wellness / Sauna / Pool. Leider wieder ein enttäuschender Tipp von SecretEscape und das bei einem sehr stolzen Zimmerpreis",3,2020,07,25

100,Es könnte so schön sein...,"Leider ist es auf den Zimmern sehr dreckig. Ob und wann die Zimmer gereinigt werden, kann ich nicht sagen. Schade, die Lage ist klasse und das Hotel eigentlich auch. Es mangelt halt an der Hygiene. Publikum hauptsächlich junge Leute.",1,2020,01,05
100,Alojamiento,"Verdaderamente impecable
Su historia hace de este hotel un lugar increíble!!!
Sus habitaciones impecables , el servicio de su personal excelente 
Calidad y servicio fantástico 
El parque es precioso y recorrerlo hace de este Hotel un lugar espectacular",5,2019,12,06
100,Aktivitäten in Amsterdam,Das Hotel Arena und das Restaurant im Park hat uns sehr gefallen. Überall sehr schöne und warme Ambiente. Hilfsbereite und freundliche Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter. Wir werden das Hotel Arena weiter empfehlen. Vielen Dank für alles.,5,2019,11,26
100,ubicación excelente,"Edificio emblemático ubicado en un parque, remodelado con diseño moderno y funcional.
Alejado del centro lo suficiente como para evitar las molestias que genera la multitud, pero cercano para desplazarse a pie.",4,2019,11,04
100,Muy recomendable y bien comunicado,"Varias paradas y líneas de tranvia cercanas, muy muy tranquilo y silencioso. Limpieza y comodidades todas. No hablan nada de castellano, así que al menos se debe saber algo de inglés. La habitación es de dos plantas, baño y salita de estar abajo y cama arriba con acceso de escalera muy muy estrecha e inclinada. No apto personas mayores o poca movilidad, en lo que a mi habitación respecta. Está en un parque por el que se puede pasear, correr... Tiene restaurante con los precios habituales en la ciudad, pero no lo utilicé aunque tenía buena pinta. ",5,2019,11,01
100,Jederzeit wieder,"Ein schönes Hotel, nicht alles in Topzustand, aber trotzdem empfehlenswert, allein wegen der schönen Lage am Park und trotzdem ist man in 15 Minuten im Zentrum.
Große Zimmer und schönes Bad. Gutes Frühstücksbuffet, ebenso Abendessen und nettes Personal. Gut zum Relaxen und sehr grün! Schöner Loungekamin",4,2019,10,17
100,Impresionante ubicación ,"El hotel se encuentra en una ubicación privilegiada dentro del Oosterpark, un impresionante parque verde, lleno de todo tipo de actividades los días de buen tiempo. 
El complejo es una antigua iglesia reconvertida en hotel con todas las comodidades. El restaurante y cafetería están realmente bien, el desayuno es sorprendente.
Las habitaciones son de corte moderno aunque con dos pegas, la cama no es todo lo cómoda que cabría esperar y el agua caliente no se mantiene, oscila entre fría y ardiendo constantemente.
Próximo al hotel hay diferentes paradas de tranvía, lo que te lleva a cualquier zona de la ciudad.",4,2019,09,29
100,Top hotel,Bellissimo hotel lo consiglio a tutti. Bellissimo il parco le camere ottima pulizia molto comoda la posizione per tram e metro e per raggiungere qualsiasi parte di Amsterdam. Spero di ritornarci presto,4,2019,08,18
100,Vacanza estiva ad Amsterdam ,"Questo anno per le vacanze estive abbiamo deciso di uscire fuori dall'Italia, ritornando in Olanda. Questa volta abbiamo deciso di alloggiare in un hotel nella zona centrale di Amsterdam così da non essere troppo lontani dal centro. L'hotel Arena è situato all'interno di Oosterpark, uno dei tre parchi della città, un bel hotel, molto elegante ed ampio. Le camere sono accoglienti e spaziose con dei lucernari che fanno entrare la luce naturale, il bagno è bello, molto ampia la zona doccia. Noi abbiamo optato per la formula colazione inclusa, buonissima la colazione continentale. Personale accogliente e cordiale. Bella esperienza.",4,2019,08,15
100,Location unica immersa nel parco di Oosterpark ,"Ho soggiornato in questo splendido Hotel 5 giorni, moderno, pulito, camere grandi e dotato di noleggio della biciclette a pagamento (unica pecca). Locale molto accogliente, dotato di un bar e ristorante annesso all’hotel con vista sul parco. Staff sia dell’hotel che del ristorante disponibile e gentile ad ogni esigenza sopratutto Nina una ragazza splendida alla reception che ci ha aiutato anche nell’acquisto dei biglietti per i musei. La ringraziamo molto per la disponibilità. 
Hotel consigliato ",5,2019,08,08
100,Nos sorprendió el alojamiento!,"En Amsterdam el alojamiento suele ser caro y malo, por eso fuimos a un sitio no tan céntrico, pero está bien comunicado con tranvía y metro. La idea era usarlo sólo para dormir, pero al estar en un parque tan bonito y tranquilo daba gusto desayunar o tomar algo antes de acostarse en su terraza. La habitación grande, sobretodo en altura, con unas ventanas enormes. El baño muy moderno. Por poner una pega, el colchón algo blando para nuestro gusto, y la nevera no enfriaba nada, pero nosotros más que satisfechos. Es un sitio para aconsejar",5,2019,08,05
100,Visita amsterdam,Algo apartado del centro; pero el edificio muy bien restaurado. Las habitaciones limpias y cómodas y el desayuno muy bueno. Había shuttel para ir y volver al aeropuerto que nos fue genial. Un hotel para repetir.,4,2019,07,20
100,Maravilloso hotel,"Maravilloso hotel en un lugar aún más bonito. Enamorada del hotel y de la ciudad. El servicio atento y dispuesto ayudar en todo momento, el hotel esta dentro de un parque muy tranquilo donde se hacen festivales y muy cercano a una parada de tranvia y a un zoologico que merece la pena descubrir",5,2019,07,17
100,ungewöhnliches Cityhotel,"Die Zimmer sind im Maisonettestil gehalten, gehen über 2 Etagen: oben ist das Bett- unten ein kleiner Raum und das Bad. Die Treppen sind höllisch steil- wie häufig in Amsterdam. Da es keine Handlauf gibt, ist mein Mann gleich am ersten Tag die Treppen heruntergestürzt- glücklicherweise hatte er nur ein Hämaton. Die Lage ist super, wir haben sehr ruhig geschlafen-  das Haus liegt in einem Park- wenngleich die Betten für uns zu weich und die Kopfkissen deutlich zu hoch waren.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Der Frühstücksraum und Restaurant liegen zum Park und sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, die Akustik dort ist gut: auch wenn viele Menschen dort sind, kann man sich unterhalten.",4,2019,06,16
100,Eine nettes Hotel welches in die Tage gekommen ist,"Das Hotel ist ein nettes Hotel welches leider in die Tage gekommen ist. Die öffentlichen Räume sind sehr gut aber die Standard Zimmer brauchen dringend eine Renovierung. Der Service ist sehr jung ud demnach fehlt auch ein großer Teil an Professionallität. 
Kleiner Tipp am Rande : Wenn ihr ein ruhiges Zimmer möchtet und über ein Wochenende bleibt, empfiehlt es sich auf Zimmer zum Innenhof zu verzichten. Hier finden meist Veranstltungen statt, die zum Rauchen und Luft holen den Innenhof nutzen.
Ansonsten ist die Lage prima. Außerhalb, von daher eher ruhig gelegen aber durch die Anbindung der Straßenbahnen ist es top mit dem Stadtkern verbunden.",3,2019,06,12
100,it can be better,"Einzelne Mängel können und müssen abgestellt werden. 
Das Bett sollte getrennte Wäsche haben. Duschen müssen wegen der Hygiene top smgereinigt sein. Die Elektroanlage darf keinesfalls Mängel aufweise. Freie elektrische Leitungen dürfen nie vorhanden sein.
Dann wäre das Hotel sehr gut.",4,2019,06,12
100,Fine settimana Amsterdam,"Abbiamo soggiornato presso l'Hotel Arena. L'albergo è molto bello, posizionato all'interno di un parco ben collegato al centro. Colazione ottima e varia. L'unica pecca è stata che le camera che ci hanno assegnato, avevano il soppalco sul quale si trovava la camera da letto, in verità un po scomoda e l'armadio quasi inesistente. Nel complesso comunque abbiamo passato un buon soggiorno.",4,2019,05,26
100,Increible hotel ,"Me he alojado en este hotel y realmente es excelente. Frente a un parque grandioso que, de tocar dias soleados, es para gozarlo sea en pareja o con niños.
Las habitaciones comodas, silenciosas, con frigobar y wifi aceptable. El baño es comodo y con una generosa ducha de agua caliente.
El desayuno es muy bueno.
La minima contra (o no) es que queda un poquito alejado del centro de Amsterdam (€8 en Uber)",5,2019,05,23
100,Hermoso hotel. Lástima la limpieza ,"El personal muy atento y resolutivo. Es una pena que con tan lindas instalaciones no se mantenga impecable como debiera, tanto las habitaciones como en resto. En nuestra habitación habían hasta pelos de visitantes anteriores, en el piso y sábanas de la cama. ",2,2019,05,21
100,Excelente!!!,"Camas muy cómodas con  lo que el descanso es reparador. Como la almohada era muy alta me la cambiaron por otra en unos momentos. Personal de recepción muy amable, con una sonrisa siempre y dispuestos a ayudar. Nos tocó la habitación 222 y el baño olía a desagüe, pero no nos apeteció pedir cambio. Desayuno variado, surtido y muy completo. Y el entorno en el parque Oosterpak de lujo. Un hotel con personalidad, muy bonito y confortable. Un edificio espectacular. Y además tuvimos la suerte de poder asistir en la capilla, habilitada para eventos, al partido de Champions Ajax-Tottenham. Lástima la derrota del Ajax porque el ambiente era extraordinario. Muy satisfechos y en un futuro cuando volvamos a Amsterdam, no dudaremos en volver al hotel Arena. Y lo recomendamos sin dudarlo. Gracias por todo. Un cordial saludo desde Pais Vasco.",5,2019,05,16

100,Location unica,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel, in occasione di una breve vacanza ad Amsterdam. La struttura merita veramente di essere vista perché ha una collocazione all’interno del parco che è meraviglioso. Le camere non sono proprio comodissime, personalmente ho avuto un grosso problema con la doccia che non sono stati in grado di risolvere ma ci hanno offerto un drink nel loro bellissimo bar e anche una colazione, quindi, va premiata la buona volontà di venire incontro al cliente. Il personale è abbastanza gentile, alcuni di più, altri di meno ma nel complesso mi sentirei di consigliarlo.",3,2019,04,13
100,Ein schönes Hotel in einer Top Lage,"Wir haben uns nicht lange aufgehalten im Hotel, spricht eine Nacht. Das Hotel ist super zentral gelegen und sehr schön, gerade auch die Umgebung mit dem Park ist toll. Sehr viele Familien mit Kindern halten sich dort auf, daher kann es auch etwas lauter werden. Die Zimmer sind schön groß und freundlich, leider muss ich die Sauberkeit kritisieren. In unserem  Family Room waren überall Spinnenweben an den Decken, Ein großer Poppel klebte in der Dusche, Böden waren auch nicht außerordentlich sauber. Wir haben gesehen wie männliche Studeten ca. 25 Jahre alt für die Sauberkeit der Zimmer verantwortlich sind, ob es daran liegt? Man weiß es nicht. Sonst alles wirklich top. Lage ist super und die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption oder im Restaurant waren sehr nett. ",4,2019,04,01
100,Soggiorno con mio figlio dal 22 al 24 Marzo.,"Location bellissima , abbiamo pagato 450 euro per due notti senza colazione. Personale gentile e struttura , ripeto, molto bella . La mattina si usciva nel parco per fare una corsetta. Fantastico. Il problema enorme è stata la stanza n 063. Di solito sono larghe ma questa era alta con una scala per salire terrificante per la pendenza. In Italia non avrebbero dato l'abitabilita'. Per salire una pedata da 25 per scendere si perdevano 10 e piu' centimetri e l'unico modo in sicurezza era scendere di schiena. Mai vista una cosa simile anche se mio figlio. residente ad Amsterdam, dice che le case olandesi sono strette ed alte. Colazione molto cara (20 euro in offerta a testa).
Se avete problemi di prostata ed avete minzioni notturne meglio evitare;)). Tra l'altro la rete di protezione mi ha procurato anche un piccolo taglio al dito. Bella l' olanda cmq.",3,2019,03,25
100,"Posto incantevole, manca qualche dettaglio nel servizio","La struttura è semplicemente incantevole! Un edificio storico reinventato senza essere stravolto e che affaccia direttamente su un parco. Le camere sono enormi con soffitti alti 6m, letto comodissimo e bagno gigante. Tutto pulitissimo. Unica pecca, ed è veramente il pelo nell'uovo, è la cura dei piccoli dettagli. 
La location non è male, a circa 30 min a piedi dal centro. Affitta biciclette a 10€ per 3 ore.",4,2019,03,03
100,"Posto molto bello, receptionist un po’ meno ","Siamo arrivate io ed una mia amica in questo hotel agli inizi di ottobre, la location si è presentata molto bene sia esternamente che internamente.. se non che quando siamo arrivate alla reception per fare il check in , le ragazze ed il ragazzo che erano lì non mi sono sembrati cordiali e avevano l’aria da ‘superiori’.. forse perchè non sapevamo bene l’inglese non saprei. A parte questo ‘inconveniente’ che in un hotel fa molto discutere in quanto reputo che la reception sia parte fondamentale dell’hotel, il resto è andato tutto molto bene, colazione ottima, camera molto bella (forse le scale troppo ripide, ma non c’era spazio, quindi capibili). 

",4,2019,03,01
100,Im ganzen ganz gut,"Sehr freundliche Damen an der Rezeption. Zimmer war trotz sehr kurzfristiger Buchung fertig. Großes Zimmer mit großem Doppelbett. Leider rutschten die Matratzen ständig auseinander. Bad geräumig. Kaffee (löslicher) auf dem Zimmer. Das Frühstück soll gut sein, ist uns pro Person aber keine 22,- wert.  Fahrradverleih am Hotel. Parkhaus unter dem Hotel. Anbindung zu Bus und Straßenbahn in wenigen Minuten. Das Hotel ist nur über einen schönen Park zu erreichen ",4,2019,02,26
100,Für eine Kurztrip vollkommen ausreichend,"- schöne Außenanlag
- netter Empfang 
- auf den ersten Blick ein saubereres und ansprechendes eingerichtetes Hotelzimmer Zimmer, später entdeckten wir aber Schimmel in der Dusche sowie gelbe  Verfärbungen in dem Waschbecken",3,2019,02,12
100,"Excelente hotel, en una ubicación hermosa en el Parque Oosterpark","El hotel es hermoso, de hecho el edificio es imponente ya que era una iglesia, que ahora se usa como residencia para casamientos y otros eventos. Está en el medio del Parque Oosterpark, con lago y todo, en uno de los barrio cool de Amsterdam y a la vuelta del Tropenmuseum. La atención del personal es muy buena y además hay alquiler de bicicletas disponible.",4,2019,01,16
100,Öffnung der Drecke während des Frühstücks,"Wenn während des Frühstücks Handwerker die Decke öffnen, ist es nicht verwunderlich das nicht nur die Kaffeetassen total verdreckt sind sondern sich der Staub und Dreck auch über das Buffet verteilt das direkt neben den Arbeiten aufgebaut ist. Es ist mir ein Rätsel, wie man solche Arbeiten während der Frühstückszeit durchführen kann. Die Zimmer waren auf den ersten Blick ok, bei genauerem Hinschauen allerdings nicht sauber. Besonders das Badezimmer. Das Hotel ist ein altes Gebäude und entsprechend hellhörig. ",2,2018,12,17
100,"Beeindruckendes Gebäude, gutes Hotel","Der historische Gebäudekomplex, aufgefrischt durch moderne Design-Elemente, ist grossartig. Mein Zimmer war klein (eigentlich bestand es in erster Linie aus deinem Doppelbett und einem kleinen Tisch), dafür unglaublich hoch. Es reichte aber eigentlich für meine Bedrüfnisse. Das Badezimmer war auch ok, eine Ablagefläche für Shampoo in der Dusche wäre wünschenswert. Mein Zimmer hatte Ausblick auf die Straße / den Fluss und war darum nicht immer ganz leise – für mich aber ebenfalls kein Problem. Positiv aufgefallen ist mir das Frühstück (durchwegs gute Qualität, liebevoll angerichtet, große Auswahl) und auch das Essen, das wir Abends in der Bar als Fingerfood bestellten (Bites platter; homemade fries), war exzellent! Bar/Restaraunt/Café sind schön eingerichtet, auch um draussen zu sitzen mit Ausblick auf den Park. Im Großen und Ganzen sehr freundliches Personal. Meist auch sehr kompetent und hilfsbereit. Das Problem, dass das Zimmer am Ankunftstag um 15 Uhr nicht bereit war, wurde m.E. aber ziemlich unsouverän gelöst von der Reception. Würde man in solchen Fällen die wartenden Leute an die Bar schicken und ihnen ein Getränk offerieren und (wichtig!) informieren kommen, sobald ein Zimmer bereit ist, würde das einen wesentlich besseren Eindruck machen, als Leute irgendwo warten zu lassen und in der Zwischenzeit Zimmer an deutlich später eintreffende Gäste (aus der selben Reisegruppe!) zu vergeben. Auf mich wirkte das Ganze aber eher überfordert als unfreundlich – kann man ja noch verbessern. Im Großen und Ganzen habe ich die Zeit im Hotel Arena aber genossen, das Hotel liegt in einer schönen Gegend etwas ausserhalb des touristischen Epizentrums.",4,2018,11,17
100,Excelente atmosfera,"El lugar es increible, es parte del parque por lo que con solo salir ya estas rodeado de naturaleza. Adentro el estilo del hotel parece sacado de una pelicula. Mucha madera, grandes escaleras, preciosas arañas de luz. Lo unico que no me gusto de la habitacion es que tenga una puesta de vidrio que no cerraba del todo, quitandole privacidad.",4,2018,11,07
100,Vacanza ad Amsterdam ,Sono stato ad Amsterdam in vacanza con la mia ragazza. Albergo molto bello e pulito. Bagno spazioso acqua caldissima e molto pulito. Letto comodo è caldo. Consiglio questo hotel in quando è anche vicino al centro. ,4,2018,10,03
100,Hotel muy bonito en una zona precioda,"Estuvimos 4 días alojados en el hotel. Teníamos reservada una habitación de dos pisos, la cama estaba en la planta de arriba. Por algún motivo había bastante ruido de tuberías de aire y nos resultó molesto para descansar esa primera noche. Le comunicamos a la chica de recepción nuestro problema y rápidamente nos dijo que nos cambiaban a otra habitación. Amable, simpática y con ganas de solucionarlos el problema. Esta nueva habitación era mucho más amplia, con un baño enorme y totalmente silenciosa. 
El desayuno era muy amplio y variado. 
El hotel está ubicado junto a un parque muy bonito y a unos 25 minutos del centro andando.
Recomendaría el hotel sin ninguna duda.",4,2018,09,25
100,Tolles modernes Hotel mit tollen Zimmern,"Wir waren in diesem Hotel für 4 Nächte.
Wir waren beeindruckt von den Zimmern. Unsers war über 2 Etagen. Unten der Wohnbereich und das Bad, oben zum Schlafen.
Fenster die bis zur Decke gehen über beide Etagen, einfach toll.
Bad total sauber und sehr modern. WLAN funktioniert einwandfrei. Frühstück kostet pP 18€. Bis zur Innenstadt sind es ca. 25 Minuten zu Fuß. Für uns der einzige Nachteil, es ist etwas außerhalb. Dafür der ruhig mit schöner Parkanlage.
Wir kommen wieder.",4,2018,09,05
100,Perfekt für ein Kurztrip nach Amsterdam,Wir fanden den Aufenthalt wunderbar. Es hat Spaß gemacht und das Hotel ist mal was anders. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel lassen sich mit vertretbaren Aufwand zu Fuß erreichen und der Abstand zur Stadt macht das Hotel ruhig und so einen großen Park bekommt man anders nicht.,5,2018,09,04
100,Stanza molto spaziosa con affaccio sul giardino,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel durante il viaggio di nozze con mia moglie. Appena arrivati ci hanno subito chiesto di pagare LA TASSA DI SOGGIORNO DA DESTINARE AL COMUNE DI AMSTERDAM, QUESTA  ESTORSIONE LEGALIZZATA ALLA QUALE I VIAGGIATORI DEBBONO SOTTOSTARE, SEBBENE ""L'UNIONE EUROPEA"" SANCISCA LA LIBERA CIRCOLAZIONE DI MERCI E PERSONE ALL'INTERNO DEI SUOI CONFINI. Dopo aver pagato questa tassa che è proporzionata al costo del soggiorno e per noi ammontava a 21,80 euro, corrispondenti a 42210 lire e a 47,96 fiorini olandesi, abbiamo potuto prendere possesso della nostra stanza. La stanza era ampia, climatizzata, con affaccio sul giardino interno e ci hanno fatto trovare una bottiglietta di prosecco e due palloncini per brindare!
Il nostro soggiorno è stato piacevole, i prezzi del bar erano avvivinabili considerando che due cornetti con un pò di burro e marmellata costavano 7 euro, corrispondenti a 13554 lire, ma in camera avevamo il caffè a disposizione e facendo la spesa al supermercato ci siamo organizzati per delle piacevoli colazioni in giardino. L'hotel ci è piaciuto molto, ma nei dintorni non ci sono negozi dove poter acquistare cibo, bigllietti per i mezzi o bancomat, ma non dipende certo da loro",4,2018,08,30
100,Sehenswert! Hotel mit Charme,"Sehr schönes Hotel,das toll ausgestattet ist und früher vermutlich mal ein Kloster oder ähnliches war. Toller Mix aus alt und modern! Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet,Personal sehr freundlich. Amsterdam ist recht teuer - dafür hat das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Gute Lage. ",4,2018,07,16
100,Gute Lage und Umgebung,"Schöne, alte Gebäude in Parkumgebung. Sehr freundliches und hilfreiches Personal. Zimmer im Neubau (16. Juni) wie im Altbau (27. Juni) sehr stylisch, durch den jeweiligen Zuschnitt aber nicht unbedingt praktisch (z.B.steile Treppe). Durch Ausfall eines Lifts über mindestens zwei Wochen (!) endlose Wege durch labyrinthische Flure und Treppen (Koffer !) zum jeweiligen Zimmer. Sauberkeit wird eher lässig gesehen. Frühstück hervorragend. Aussensitzgelegenheiten angegammelt und unsauber (verdreckte und verfleckte Polster).  Mit öffentlichen Verkehrsdmitteln relativ schnell in der Innenstadt.",4,2018,07,07
100,Curso,"Se trata de un antiguo orfanato transformado en hotel. Muy amplio y la habitación que me dieron: amplia, silenciosa, luminosa, en dos alturas y limpia. El desayune con un buffet muy bueno, bien presentado y de calidad. El restaurante muy correcto aunque se echa en falta una ligera mejora en la velocidad de servicio.  El hotel está en medio de un parque precioso y está cerca del centro y bien comunicado. Totalmente recomendable. Volveré!",4,2018,07,05
100,Molto carino,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 3 notti. L’hotel è stato ricavato ristrutturando un antico edificio (forse un orfanotrofio) La camera si sviluppa in verticale con un’ampia vetrata che occupa l’intera parete esterna che affaccia sul verde. Al piano terra un bel bagno con un’ampia doccia e un soggiornino dotato di frigorifero, un bel divano e armadio con asse e ferro da stiro e televisione. Salendo una scala un po’ ripida si accede al soppalco dove si trova un comodissimo letto matrimoniale e un’altra TV. L’hotel è situato a pochi minuti a piedi dalla fermata della Metro che porta in centro. Insomma: rispondente alle aspettative.",4,2018,06,21

100,"Überraschung, die nach hinten losgegangen ist","Mein Liebster wollte mich mit dem Hotel überraschen. Es ist eine alte Kirche, die umgebaut wurde. Soweit alles schön. Unser Zimmer war leider nicht so schön. Der Raum war nicht sauber. Im Waschbecken gelbe Ränder, Schimmel in der Dusche, Kalkablagerungen wo man hinsieht. Unter dem Bett große Flusen; ich habe nicht genauer hinsehen wollen. Unser Doppelbett trennte sich immer selbstständig; da fehlen wohl die Stopper unter den Pfosten. Die Auflagen schwankten immer nach rechts und links. Grachtenfahrten sind ja was Feines, aber bitte nicht in meinem Hotelbett. Die Tür der Badzelle schließt nicht, riesige Spalten zu Boden und Decke: wirklich nicht schön.
Sehr, sehr schade. Und die Preise spiegeln dies leider überhaupt nicht wieder.

Das Frühstück hingegen war gut. Ordentlich und schön sortiert. ",3,2018,05,27
100,"Schade, so ein schönes Hotel","ein wunderschönes Hotel in einer guten Lage mit einem großen Park gegenüber. Trotz upgrade oder vielleicht gerade weil ?,.................das Waschbecken war nur oberflächlich gesäubert, mit vielen alten gelben Flecken am Rande, das Rohr unter dem Waschbecken war total verschmutzt und der Boden drum herum ebenfalls. In der Decke des Appartements war ein grosses Loch und man konnte durch die Decke sehen. Staubfusseln waren in den Ecken des Raumes. Alles in allem stimmte somit das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis nicht. Ich würde wieder in diesem Hotel übernachten, mir jedoch vorher den Raum ansehen wollen.",3,2018,05,22

100,Hotel bellissimo ma non andate al bar!,"Hotel bellissimo e suggestivo, stile unico e mozzafiato. Camere spaziose e luninosissime, letto comodo ed enorme.
Il personale gentile e disponibile. Non do il massimo per il bar/ristorante. I camerieri sono un pó acidi e con la puzza sotto al naso, la cucina non offre un granché e chiude alle 22 e soprattutto, i prezzi del cibo sono spropositati (22 € a persona per la colazione é uno sproposito, anche se a buffet!)",4,2018,05,06
100,"Essen sehr gut, der Service ist eine Katastrophe!","Ich war mit meiner Frau vom 12.-15.04.2018 in diesem Hotel. Gebucht hatten wir die Villa-Suite, das zumindest teuerste Zimmer im Hotel. Wir kamen morgens um 11:00 Uhr an, das Zimmer konnte jedoch wie vereinbart erst ab 15:00 Uhr bezogen werden. Wir gingen also in die Stadt und kamen um 17:00 Uhr zurück. Das Zimmer war immer noch nicht fertig, wir erhielten einen Gutschein für jeweils ein Getränk in der Hotelbar mit dem Hinweis, dass wir informiert werden, sobald das Zimmer fertig ist. Da uns auch nach 1,5 Stunden keine Information erreichte, machte ich mich auf den Weg zur Reception. Nach einem weiteren Telefonat erhielten wir dann unsere Keycard und wir gingen auf´s Zimmer. Der erste Eindruck war sehr gut, doch nach genauerem Hinschauen entdeckten wir diverse Spinnweben an den Wänden, einige Flecken auf dem Boden (wahrscheinlich noch von der Renovierung, bzw. Farbreste) und div. Beschädigungen der Wände. Auf der Terrasse befand sich ein verschmutzter Holztisch mit 4 verschmutzten Plastikstühlen, sowie ein voller Aschenbecher und ein leerer Pizzakarton auf dem Boden. Generell machte die Terrasse einen sehr verwahrlosten Eindruck.
Am nächsten Morgen machten wir uns mit den 4 vorrätigen Kaffekappseln jeweils 2 Kaffee und nutzen als Milchersatz die vorhandenen Kaffee-Creamer (Pulver), danach gingen wir zum Frühstücksraum, bzw. Restaurant. Da diese Reise ein Geschenk von Freunden war, wussten wir nicht sicher, ob das Frühstück inklusive ist, wir gingen allerdings davon aus. Auf Nachfrage bei der Receptionistin wurden uns gesagt, das Frühstück (19,50 € pro Person!) sei nicht inklusive. Ich hackte noch einmal nach (weil ich es ungewöhnlich fand...) und die Receptionistin telefonierte und sagte dann, sie müsse sich entschuldigen, dass Frühstück wäre doch inklusive. Gleiches Prozedere übrigens am Eingang des Frühstücksaals am 1. und am 2. Tag! 
Das Frühstück war generell sehr gut, nur am 2. Tag waren wir erst gg. 10:30 Uhr im Saal und diverse Angebote waren bereits vergriffen und wurden erst wieder aufgefüllt, als wir unser Frühstück bereits beendet hatten. An diesem Tag lagen auch keine neuen Kaffeekapseln auf unserem Zimmer und wir mussten auf den vorhandenen Instantkaffee zurück greifen. Auch am 3. und 4. Tag stand uns nur der Instantkaffee zur Verfügung, leider ging der Kaffeecreamer am 4. Tag aus und wir mussten unseren Kaffee schwarz trinken.
Wir haben an 2 Abenden im Hotel gegessen, das Essen war hervorragend! Der Service jedoch generell in Hotel und Restaurant im maximal 3-Sterne-Niveau!
Am Tag unserer Abreise wollte man uns noch 120,- € für das Frühstück berechnen, dies verweigerten wir jedoch, da sich mittlerweile herausgestellt hatte, dass Frühstück mit gebucht wurde. Uns wurde lediglich der Parkplatz in der Tiefgarage für 72 Stunden mit ca. 50,- € berechnet.
Bis zum Schluss hat sich übrigens der Zustand auf der Terrasse nicht geändert! Diese war so nicht benutzbar!",1,2018,04,18

100,PECCATO.........potrebbe essere davvero perfetto,"Hotel ricavato  da un'ex orfanotrofio, situato in un mega parco pubblico, appena fuori Amsterdam.
Per raggiungere il centro, si puo' prendere a soli 50 metri il tram n7, dopo due fermate scendere alla fermata  metro di WEESPERPLEIN, e da li con qualsiasi delle 3 linee esistenti andare verso la stazione centrale. Con l'efficienza dei mezzi olandesi il tutto dura una ventina di minuti e anche la sera circolano fino a tarda ora. I biglietti esistono ad ora e costano 3 euro, poi ci sono i 24 ore e i 48 ore rispettivamente di 12,50 e 25 euro (naturalmente puoi prendere metro-tram-autobus).
L'albergo è sicuramente di categoria lusso, ma si perdono in dei piccoli dettagli che poi fanno la differenza.
Innanzitutto  se non si parla molto bene l'inglese o non si conosce il tedesco o lo spagnolo si è spacciati, perché il personale è giovane e l'italiano non sa neanche cosa sia. Il problema è che se tu gli dici che parli poco l'inglese se ne fottono e continuano a parlarti in inglese fluente come se niente fosse........consiglio app per tradurre.
Le camere sono tutte molto particolari,ove si mischia l'antico con il moderno; ma anche qui una pecca.......camera non  proprio luccicante (cicca a terra, vasca un po sporca, una spugna a terra).
wi-fi ottimo in tutta la struttura, tv con solo una ventina di canali tutti in olandese. 
Colazione (che non'é inclusa nel prezzo) costa 21 euro a testa. Consiglio di farla al bar al piano terra.
Parcheggio tranquillo e riservato al costo di 30 euro al giorno.
Per un albergo di 4 stelle e per il prezzo speso mi aspetterei piu' professionalità del personale e di sicuro una pulizia migliore delle camere.",4,2018,03,24
100,Sehr schönes und stylisches Hotel in guter Lage direkt am Park mit idealer Anbindung,Der Besuch im Arena Hotel war sehr schön. Eine überaus stylische und schöne Einrichtung des Hotels sowie der Zimmer. Ein hoteleigenes Parkhaus ist ebenfalls gegen Gebühr nutzbar. Das Hotel liegt direkt am Park und ist daher sehr schön gelegen. Die Anbindung an die lokale Infratsruktur (Tram Linie 7 & 10 sowie Metro Station Wespersplein ins Zentrum) ist ebenfalls optimal. Man gelangt so selbst in wenigen gehminuten mit den öffentlichen schnell und problemlos in das Stadtzentrum.,4,2018,03,20
100,Tolles Hotel mit angrenzendem Park,"Ideal für Businessveranstaltungen mit Niveau. Sehr schön gestaltete Zimmer und tolles Ambiente. Freundliches Personal beim Check in und in allen anderen Fragen. Mein Zimmer im 3. Stock war nicht ganz leicht zu finden. Sehr zu empfehlen auch die Bar, sehr gemütlich!",4,2018,03,15
100,Ein faszinierender Aufenthalt,"Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb der eigentlichen Touristenattraktionen. Etwa 3 Kilometer Fußmarsch muss man einplanen, jedoch wussten wir das vorab und haben dies auch eingeplant. Die Ankunft war zunächst ein Schreck, auf Grund der Anreise mit dem eigenen Auto habe ich extra ein Hotel mit einer Garage oder einem Parkplatz gesucht. Die Einfahrt der Hotelgarage ernüchterte jedoch sofort, da dort geschrieben stand eine Nacht koste 30,00€ extra...20% zusätzlich nur für Parken? Na ja dachte ich mir, dass ist schon frech... Nach einem kurzen Gespräch mit einer Einheimischen über die Funktion der Parkuhr wurde mir klar, dass der Preis an der Straße im Vergleich komplett abgehoben war... 4€ pro Stunde an einer dunklen Straße in einem Randbezirk???... An der Frankfurt Hauptwache bezahle ich im Parkhaus weniger...
Na ja gut also doch in die Tiefgarage, die Einfahrt ist im übrigen mit einem Geländewagen nur mit viel Fingerspitzengefühl und einer 360 Grad Kamera sicher zu bewältigen. Nachdem wir nun in der Lobby standen waren wir sehr positiv beeindruckt.. Ein cooles Flair wird durch den gekonnten Mix aus Alt und Neu verbreitet. Eine sehr zuvorkommende junge Dame hat uns am Empfang begrüßt und über alles aufgeklärt. Sie sprach perfekt Englisch und konnte uns noch Tipps für die Tagesplanung geben. 
Das Zimmer war ebenfalls beeindruckend, das Bad welches durch Glas und schwarze Hochglanzfliesen sehr modern wirkt steht im Kontrast zu einem eher rustikalen Rest. Eine steile Treppe in den ""2. Stock"" ist nur zu bestreiten wenn man fit ist und einen guten Gleichgewichtssinn hat. Leider sieht man dem Zimmer in vielen Teilen bereits an, dass es in die Jahre gekommen ist... Ein abgenutzter Dielenboden im Eingansbereich, veraltete und kleine Fernseher, abgegriffene Treppe und an vielen Stellen blättert bereits der weiße Lack ab... Man muss jedoch positiv bemerken, dass unser Zimmer sehr sauber war. Es laufen nur 2 deutsche Sender (ARD und ZDF) jedoch strahlen die holländischen Sender nahezu alle Spielfilme in englischem Originalton aus. Alles in allem kann man das Hotel als besonders bezeichnen. Selbst ohne das Vorwissen zur Historie fängt das eigene Kopfkino an zu laufen sobald man durch die Gänge und die großzügigen Treppenhäuser schlendert. Das Restaurant und der Park im hinteren Bereich des Hotels laden zum verweilen ein. Ich denke der Preis ist etwas überhöht. Trotz alle dem würde ich anderen Reisenden einen Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel durchaus empfehlen, da es gut aber ruhig liegt und mit seinem Ambiente ohnehin schon eine paar Pluspunkte sammelt. Punktabzug gibt es für die Citytax die beim Auschecken anfällt... War uns so nicht bewusst und sind für die eine Nacht mal eben knapp 8,50€ gewesen... Da kann das Hotel aber grundsätzlich ja nun nichts zu.

Alles in allem kann man zusammen fassen:
+ Sehr nettes Personal 
+ Extrem cooles Flair des gesamten Komplexes
+ Definitiv einen Aufenthalt wert

- Renovierungsbedarf an manchen Ecken
- Sehr hohe Parkgebühren und eine enge Tiefgarageneinfahrt 
- Durch die Betten im ""2. Stock"" ist es im Bett immer zu heiß oder im Bad zu kalt",4,2018,03,06
100,Spitzen Hotel!,"Das Hotel ist toll gelegen, öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind in der Nähe. Das Zentrum ist mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln in kurzer Zeit (5min) zu erreichen. Wunderschöne, saubere und geräumige Zimmer. Das Frühstücksbuffet war vielfältig und hatte für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei. Das Personal war stets hilfsbereit und freundlich. Ich kann dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen und würde es sofort wieder buchen!",5,2018,02,12
100,Durchschnittliches Hotel mit Verbesserungsbedarf und überhöhten Preisen,"NOrmalerweise schreibe ich ja keine Bewertungen, aber diesmal musste es sein.
Das Hotel liegt sehr schön und recht zentral am Oosterpark.
Von außen ist es sehr schön aber die Zimmer könnten eine Renovierung vertragen, da teilweise der Putz schon von der Decke und den Wänden fällt.
Wir hatten ein Maisonette-Zimmer. Nach dem Eintreten hatte man einen Eingangsbereich, einen kleinen Wohnbereich mit Couch und Schreibtisch und das Bad. Im oberen Stockwerk befand sich das Bett.
Wir kamen gerade aus der Karibik und wollten noch 3 Nächte hier verbringen wodurch wir auch jeweils einen Koffer hatten. Das führte direkt zur ersten Schwierigkeit. Für einen Koffer gab es eine aufklappbare Ablage im Schrank der zweite musste dann mitten im Wohnbereich stehen wodurch man den Schreibtisch nicht nutzen konnte und auch beim Sitzen auf der Couch waren die Füße dann immer auf dem Koffer. Meiner Meinung nach ein viel zu kleines Zimmer für 2 Personen.
Die Dusche sah schön und modern aus, leider aber ohne jegliche Lüftung wodurch man ungern die Toilette genutzt hat da sich alles in kürzester Zeit im Zimmer verteilte
Leider waren auf dem Boden im Bad Schuhabdrücke zu sehen. Und auch am nächsten Tag nach dem Putzen waren die Abdrücke da. Es wurde nämlich nicht geputzt. Die Mülleimer wurden geleert und die Mülltüte dann im Zimmer liegen gelassen (ich hoffe aus versehen).
Am zweiten Tag wurde dann gar nicht mehr geputzt bzw. das Zimmer überhaupt betreten obwohl das Schild an der Tür hing.
Zu allem Überfluss habe ich mir eine Salmonellen Vergiftung beim Frühstück geholt.
Also das Frühstück war alles in allem gut und es sah auch gut aus. Meine Verlobte hatte Omelett und andere Speißen gegessen und alles war gut. Die Wurst stand aber schon etwas länger da. 
Die Zimmer haben eine Minibar, welche aber leer war und einen ziemlcih komischen Geruch hatte. Auch hier könnte mal geputzt werden.. Man muss sich Getränke in der Lobby kaufen und diese kann man dann in der Minibar aufbewahren....
Das Personal war aber sehr nett und immer hilfsbereit da wir ja einige anliegen hatten.
Ich kann dieses Hotel leider nicht weiter empfehlen (auch ohne Magenverstimmung würde ich dies nicht tun) da das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis gar nicht stimmt. Es muss deutlich renoviert werden und auch die Sauberkeit könnte verbessert werden. Im Endeffekt Zahlt man für die Lage.
Ich hoffe nur die anderen Zimmer sind besser.",1,2018,02,09
100,Durchschnittliches Hotel,"Wir waren zu zweit über's Wochenende dort. Kamen an, Hotel schön gelegen in einem großen Park, im Osten Amsterdams. Obwohl vor der Tür Straßenbahnen und Busse fahren, mussten wir ziemlich lange bis zur Haltestelle Richtung Innenstadt laufen , mehr als 10 min. Sind meistens immer zu Fuß gelaufen ca 35min. Das Hotel war für uns: außen hui innen nicht so.. das Gebäude ist wahnsinnig schön, auf drn erstem Blick sieht alles sehr toll und faszinierend aus, ebenfalls die Zimmer mit einer Treppe drin. Leider sind die Zimmer nicht sauber, Waschbecken, Dusche, boden nicht gründlich geputzt worden, Toilette war jedoch sauber. Die Einrichtung, Wände etwas in die Jahre gekommen, die Fenster waren grausam- dreckig,undicht es hat gezogen trotz Gardine zu ziehen. Es wird über die Klimaanlage geheizt, diese war oben, unten war das Bett ziemlich kalt vom Fenster die Wärme kam nicht so gut an. Mitarbeiter sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, hilfsbereit. Am besten Fahrräder mieten und die Stadt erkunden.",3,2018,02,06
100,Habitacion sucia fria y mal servicio de limpieza ,"Hotel bonito y muy bien conservado, la habitación un desastre de limpieza, sin jabón en la ducha, escasa limpieza en baño y em habitacion, dejabamos trampas y se nota que ni oasar el aspirador o cepillo, taza WC sucia, se acabo el papel higienico, no habia de repuesto, el baño es de paredes de cristal lo que no da intimidad, ruido y habitacion fria..... Un desastre, para no repetiir....sin embargo nuesteos amigos en planta primera ni tuvieron problemas de limpieza.... Asi que una cara lotería. ",2,2018,01,10
100,Insomma...,"Hotel 4 stelle??
Stanze strutturate a soppalco scomode , non c’è una sedia ove appoggiare niente. 
In altezza sono enormi in metri utilizzabili una miseria.
Cattivo odore proveniente dal 🚽 
Assolutamente bocciato. Oltretutto si fa pagare come un 4 stelle. 
Mezzi non vicino 900mt
Personalmente non consiglio. 
Concedo due stelle per il letto comodo. 
—
4 Stars??
Uncomfortable loft-style rooms, there is no chair to support anything.
In height the rooms seems enormous; in meters usable a misery.
Horrible smell from 🚽 
Absolutely rejected. 
Moreover, you pay as a 4-star.
Underground not close to hotel 
Personally I do not recommend
Allow 2 ⭐️ cause comfortable bed",2,2018,01,08
100,Un desastre,"Una experiencia muy desagradable. Nos cobraron 550€ por dos noches. Nos dieron una habitación en la segunda planta, con desniveles, no se podía andar sin vigilar porque había escalones. El baño no lo hicieron en los dos días que estuvimos allí aunque nos quejamos de la falta d limpieza. Solo nos hicieron la cama. Además apareció un estropajo en medio del pasillo que llevaba del ascensor a nuestra habitación. Estuvo allí los dos días.
Al marchar quisimos hablar con algún responsable y...había salido !!!! En serio, de lo peor. No lo recomendamos, para nada!",1,2018,01,02
100,Sicuramente il più bello ad Amsterdam,"Siamo arrivati ieri ed e' stato subito feeling. Una perfetta fusione tra natura, architettura, design, sapiente opera di riconversione (era un orfanotrofio). Personale giovane, preparatissimo e gentile (avrò inviato almeno tre e mail prima di partire). I miei figli (25 e 22 anni) lo adorano. Complimenti allo staff. Siamo ancora qui per altri 2 giorni.

100,Unica pecca.. il bagno,"Albergo molto bello, immerso nel verde.

100,Schickes Hotel in ruhiger Lage,"Wir verbrachten 3 Nächte in diesem schicken Hotel. Wir hatten Räder vom Hotel ausgeliehen und waren so in wenigen Minuten in der Innenstadt. Das Hotel ist sehr stylisch, das Standard Doppelzimmer aber relativ klein. Das sehr gemütliche und komfortable Doppelbett befindet sich auf einer Empore. 
Das Bad ist, dem Trend entsprechend, ein Glaskasten und bietet nicht unbedingt Privatsphäre. Bei Paaren ok, bei anderen eher nicht.",4,2017,11,15
100,Schönes Hotel und mit gemietetem Rad alles erreichbar,"Die Zufahrt zum Hotel ist aufgrund einer Baustelle nur von der Rückseite erreichbar, in der hauseigenen Tiefgarage habe ich für 30€/24h einen Parkplatz bekommen. Hier standen meiner Meinung nach genau freie Plätze zur Verfügung. Ein Fahrrad man man für 15€/24h mieten. Das Zimmer war schön gestaltet, jedoch nicht ganz sauber und wurde trotz des Hinweises darüber welche Dinge nicht in Ordnung ist dennoch nicht in Ordnung gebracht.  Sollte in einem 4 Sterne Hotel so nicht sein. Ansonsten alles in Ordnung, Mitarbeiter äußerst freundlich, Getränkepreise abends in der Bar fair und Frühstück war auch gut. ",3,2017,11,10
100,Relax assoluto.,"Che dire? Hotel favoloso.

Partiamo dalla location: l'albergo è situato all'interno di uno dei tanti parchi di Amsterdam,  Oosterpark per la precisione. Il parco è mediamente piccolo ma molto carino. Ci sono laghetti e campi da tennis al suo interno.
L'hotel si trova proprio all'ingresso del parco, e vi sembrerà di avere un immenso giardino tutto per voi. Bellissimo è poter usufruire del servizio bar con vista sul parco.

L'hotel è elegante, storico e moderno allo stesso tempo, e le camere sono favolose ( anche la nostra che credo fosse la più economica tra le varie tipologie ). Era suddivisa su due livelli, con al piano terra bagno e saloncino e al primo piano il letto matrimoniale.

Per quanto riguarda i pasti non posso dirvi niente perchè avevo solo pernottamento, però posso dirvi che la sola colazione costa 21 €, un'esagerazione, ma così un pò in tutta Amsterdam. Comunque potete rimediare comprando la colazione al supermercato e tenendola nel minibar della camera.

Spero di ritornarci presto!",5,2017,11,08

100,Schönes Hotel in guter Lage,"Das Hotel ARENA liegt Süd/östlich vom Zentrum.
Lage: Mit der Straßenbahn gelangt man schnell in den Kern der Staat. 
Hotel: Das alte Kloster wurde mir Charme und Stiel ganz renoviert.
Personal: Sehr nett und hilfsbereit.
Zimmer: Auf den ersten Blick ganz ok.Was mir nicht gefallen hatte war:
1)Das Zimmer besitzt keine richtige Heizung, es wird über die Klimaanlage geheizt(wenn sie funktioniert)
2)Die Fenster waren nicht ganz dicht, so dass bei Sturm die Gardinen durch den Wind wackelten.
3)Keine gefüllte Mini Bar. Man muss unten in der Rezeption was kaufen.
4)Die Abflüsse stanken extrem.
5)Unser Zimmer wurden bei unserer Abwesenheit zwischen 09:00 und 18:00 nicht geputzt. Erst Um 18:20 klopfte es an der Tür.
Zur Wiedergutmachung,bekam ich jedoch die 2 Tage Parken geschenkt(+- 60€).

Wir hatten ein 2-stöckiges Zimmer, das hatte ich so noch nicht gesehen und war neugierig wie das umgesetzt wurde. 
Einrichtung ist modern&chic, leider etwas schon in die Jahre gekommen.
Man merkt, dass die Zimmer mal eine kleine Überholung vertragen würden (z.B. streichen der Wände). Ist aber sonst alles in einem guten Zustand (Bad, Lobby, etc.).

Kleines Manko ist die Tür zum Badezimmer. Da alles aus Glas ist, kann man nicht komplett abschließen. Hier muss man für tägliche Bedürfnisse einfach etwas koordinieren ;)

Lobby ist sehr lässig gehalten und lädt zum verweilen ein. Frühstück ist lecker, wirkt erst einmal Teuer, dafür gibt es aber frische und hochwertige Produkte.

Lage ist mit 3-5 Tramstationen ins Zentrum bzw. zu Sehenswürdigkeiten ideal wenn man es etwas ruhiger mag. Fußläufig sind einige Lokale zu erreichen (5-15min.).

Le pulizie, fatte in modo troppo superficiale, appena arrivati al chek-in ore 20:40 circa, il pavimento era pieno di capelli dei precedenti ospiti e le lenzuola ancora per terra in un angolo, pezzi di carta accanto al letto, avevamo la stanza su doppio livello, ovviamente ho le foto a conferma. Al che-out, abbiamo avuto un sovrapprezzo di circa € 20,00 rispetto alla mail di cauzione con carta di credito, la ragione non è stata comunicata. Non abbiamo chiesto nessun servizio supplementare e nulla di più che il pernottamento.
Nell'insieme la struttura è immersa in un bel contesto, ma per la spesa affrontata non credo lo consiglierei a nessuno.

Albergo un po' vecchio e troppo grande. Pecca un po' sui particolari. Dalle foto sembrava più bello. Per essere un 4 stelle non aveva neanche il necessaries in bagno. La camera non veniva pulita bene. Il letto a volte nemmeno rifatto. 
Ho dimenticato due carica batterie in camera durante il check out e quando me ne sono accorta due ore dopo, il personale non sapeva dove fossero finiti. Persi. 
Colazione buona. Ma per avere un caffè sembrava abbastanza complicato. Sembravano poco organizzati.

Also: befriedigend: Und so ist das ARENA. Die Hausbewohner, also der Service, sind super freundlich und engagiert, das Gesamtambiete ist wohnlich und nicht overdesigned, die Zimmer (zumindest unseres: 302) ausreichend groß, der morgendliche Kaffee schmeckt und weckt. Aber alles ist irgendwie angedotzt und angeschmudelt. Nicht schlimm. Wie zu Hause wahrscheinlich. Da fällt es einem nur nicht mehr auf. Hier eben schon.

Nuestra habitación fue cómoda, de dos pisos pequeños, y en la parte de abajo estaba le baño. El único detalle que no me gustó es que el baño no tiene paredes sino vidrios, así que si vas a compartir habitación con alguien de no mucha confianza no te lo recomiendo. 
Por otro lado, está en una zona no muy céntrica. Es cierto que Amsterdam es pequeño y nosotros llegábamos caminando hasta el centro y las zonas turísticas pero si no te gusta caminar quizás quieras buscar una opción más cercana. ",4,2017,05,24

Das Hotel verfügt über eine sehr gute Küche! Bei schönem Wetter ist die Terrasse sehr gut besucht. Hier kehren nicht nur Touristen ein. 
Auch das Frühstücksbuffet ist reichhaltig. Verschiedene Kaffee-Spezialitäten, Säfte und Marmeladen sowie Wurst, Käse, Fisch und Joghurt warten auf die Gäste. Wer es deftig mag, kommt mit Bacon, Rührei und Bohnen sicherlich auch auf seine Kosten.

Das Personal ist sehr nett und vor allem hilfsbereit. Wir hatten den Wunsch das Zimmer zu wechseln, da unser erstes an der Straße lag und wir lieber bei offenem Fenster, als bei laufender Klimaanlage schlafen. Unserem Wunsch wurde sofort nachgekommen und nach kurzer Zeit stand ein fertiges Zimmer zur Verfügung. 
So hatten wir auch die Möglichkeit, zwei der wirklich sehr speziellen Zimmer in Augenschein zu nehmen. 
Wer ausgefallene Hotelzimmer mag, wird hier fündig. Egal, ob zweistöckig oder ebenerdig, die Zimmer sind sauber und machen einen guten Eindruck. 

Das Hotel-Ambiente ist sehr schön. Aktuell ist im Innenhof und in einem der zahlreichen Gebäudeflügel noch mit Bauarbeiten zu rechnen. Diese sind aber keinesfalls störend für die Gäste. Wir haben uns zu keiner Zeit belästigt gefühlt. 
In den bereits renovierten Teilen des Hotels, gehen Moderne und Antike Hand in Hand. Eine sehr gelungene Mischung aus Erhaltenem und Neuen. Bis zum August sollen aber alle Arbeiten abgeschlossen sein. 

Die Lage des Hauses ist ideal für Menschen, die nach einem aufregenden Stadtbummel- und Sightseeing-Tag in der Stadt, wieder etwas Ruhe möchten. 
Für Erkundungstouren kann man entweder zu Fuß am Wasser entlang innerhalb von ca. 20 Minuten in der Stadt sein oder man nutzt die Tram, die quasi vor der Tür verkehrt und ist innerhalb von 10 Minuten mitten drin. 

Rundum können wir das Hotel nur empfehlen! Wir kommen auf jeden Fall noch einmal wieder.

100,Che gita...,"Non posso non recensire uno degli hotel che ha segnato in maniera indelebile la mia adolescenza.. l'albergo è in una buona posizione, le camere molto carine la mostra si sviluppava su due livelli. Bello il parco intorno...",5,2017,04,11
100,Unico,"L'albergo è molto particolare, parte di esso è un campanile ristrutturato, immerso nel verde parco con laghetto. Gli uccellini danno un dolce risveglio. Le camere  e i bagni sono comodi e spaziosi, ma Attenzione per chi ha un minimo di pudore c'è una nota un po' ""stonata"" la separazione tra bagni e camere sono costituite da vetro trasparente in parte offuscato con vetro nero, ma tutto ciò che avviene all'interno del bagno è visibile dalla camera. Il personale è molto cordiale, disponibile e alla mano. Il ristorante che c'è all'interno è molto carino, all'ingresso c'è un piccolo camino dove ci si può sedere attorno e bere qualcosa, io eviterei pranzo e cena, noi abbiamo mangiato male, va bene per bere un aperitivo.",5,2017,04,07
100,Hippes Ambiente,"Ehemaliges Waisenhaus mit kichlicher Vergangenheit, so ist die alte Kapelle jetzt ein Veranstaltungsraum. Alt und Neu harmoniert hier u. E. sehr gut. Der Service war einem 4* Hotel angemessen und insgesamt freundlich. Das Frühstück war ausreichend und vielfältig, so u. a. auch jeden Moegen Lachs und Prosecco. Der Cappocino vom Barista war besser als der Kaffee vom Buffet und kostet nichts extra. Die Zimmer waren ok, allerdings ist das Bett im Standardzimmer auf einer Empore. Ist ganz nett aber vielleicht nicht für ältere Semester.",4,2017,04,05
100,Fantastico!,"Confortevole e suggestiva: location perfetta per trascorrere qualche giorno alla scoperta di Amsterdam. Il personale é gentile e preparato, le stanze grandi con magnifici materassi. L' albergo è grande ma piacevolmente silenzioso. Nel ristorante si mangia molto bene a prezzi ragionevoli. Super consigliato!",5,2017,03,24
100,"Schick und außergewöhnlich, aber Punktabzug für den Restaurant-Service","Außergewöhnliches Haus, das sehr stilvoll saniert und eingerichtet wurde. Wirklich schick. Entfernung zu Fuß bis zum Grachtengürtel etwa 30 Minuten.

Wir buchten ein Standard-Doppelzimmer, das sich als Maisonette-Zimmer erwies. Schönes Design (hohe Fenster, Bad durch schwarzes Glas abgetrennt, Bett auf der oberen Ebene). Allerdings waren die Wände zum Nachbarzimmer so dünn, dass wir wirklich jedes Wort unserer Nachbarn (die ""gut drauf"" waren, aber keinesfalls gebrüllt haben) verstanden haben. Das führte dazu, dass wir nicht schlafen konnten. Wir wurden problemlos und umgehend umgebucht (nächtlicher Umzug inklusive, aber das war besser als eine schlaflose Nacht). Das neue Zimmer war mit einem Upgrade auf die nächste Zimmer-Kategorie verbunden (kein Maisonette, dafür größer - womöglich war das der ""Large Room""?).
Übrigens: Die Betten sind tatsächlich ziemlich weich, zumindest für unser Empfinden. Muss man mögen.

Sehr hübscher Restaurant-Bereich mit Blick auf den Park. Und mit Kamin. Dort haben wir allabendlich gesessen und einen Drink genossen. Das Service-Personal im Gastro-Bereich war zumindest beim Frühstück leider nicht so toll. Zwar waren alle außerordentlich freundlich, allerdings nicht sehr umsichtig. Mein Partner, der morgens gern einen Kaffee genießt, bis ich fertig bin und wir zusammen frühstücken können, hat an allen 3 Tagen morgens bis zu 1 Stunde gewartet, um einen Kaffee bestellen zu können.
Eine bessere Service-Ausbildung, die dieser Hotelkategorie und auch dem Preis angemessen ist, ist empfehlenswert.
Leider waren auch die Speisen nicht sehr herausragend. Das Frühstück empfanden wir als etwas mau und übersichtlich. Rührei aus dem Tetrapack. Eine von uns bestellte Karottensuppe am Abend war sehr ""neutral"" im Geschmack, um es nett auszudrücken.",4,2017,03,24
100,Posto da favola!,"Ho alloggiato cinque giorni in questo incantevole, fiabesco, principesco e gotico hotel. Ho prenotato su Booking ad un ottimo prezzo (per ristrutturazione e lavori vari di una parte di hotel) una camera matrimoniale. Personale disponibile e gentile, camera su due piani, pulita, con bollitore per farsi un the e berlo guardando il panorama dall'immensa finestra. Lo consiglio anche se la faccia prezzo è leggermente alta. ",5,2017,03,18
100,Lo recomiendo ,"El hotel en si esta muy bien situado, justo delante esta el tranvia y el metro a unos 8 minutos. 
Como se puede ver en las fotografias, las habitaciones son excelentes, una habitación ""duplex"" y muy modernas en si. 
Actualmente el hotel esta en obras (no molestan en las horas de descanso) así que en breves el hotel estará mejor aún. 
El restaurante del hotel esta muy conseguido y se come muy bien! ",4,2017,03,15
100,Ok,Alles ok - sehr freundliches Personal - interessantes Gebäude mit origineller Dekoration - etwas außerhalb vom Zentrum (ca. 20 Minuten zu gehen) - sind zur Zeit Umbauarbeiten von denen man eigentlich nichts mitbekommt ,4,2017,03,09
100,"Schönes, gut gelegenes Hotel in Amsterdam","Schönes, stilvolles Hotel, gut gelegen (Haltestelle in unmittelbarer Entfernung). Netter Service, schöne Zimmer, leider aktuell noch Baustelle, sodass um 8 Uhr die Handwerker angefangen haben zu arbeiten. Empfehlenswert!",4,2017,03,09
100,Schickes Hotel,"Das Hotel eignet sich vorzüglich für einen Städtetripp nach Amsterdam. Es ist schön zentral gelegen am Oostpark, etwa 20 Minuten Fußweg ins unmittelbare Zentrum nach China Town. Die Zimmer sind schön komfortabel, das Hotel ist insgesamt stilvoll eingerichtet.",4,2017,03,07
100,Molto bello,"Hotel elegante e accogliente con personale disponibile e gentile ! 
Stanze dotate di ogni confort ( riscaldamento , asciugacapelli , asciugamani , sapone , l'occorrente per farsi un tè, etc ...) . Le camere vengono sistemate ogni mattina , con una pulizia discreta ( c'è da dedicare più attenzione nella pulizia dei pavimenti !!!) . Cibo ottimo servito da un personale competente! ",4,2017,03,06
100,Hotel Particolare,"Hotel a 4 stelle Molto Particolare... 
Situato nella parte centrale ma abbastanza spostato dalle zone turistiche. difronte ha un bellissimo parco che la mattina viene apprezzato mentre si fa collazione... 
La nostra camera era una BASIC molto piccola a due piani, sotto avevamo la doccia  e un divano con la TV e su c?era un comodissimo letto matrimoniale molto soffice + altra Tv..  con una gigantesca finestra che illumina tutta la camera... Collazione tropo cara anche se c'era un ampia scelta... e non metto in dubbio la qualità del ristorante dove ho mangiate benissimo (entrecéttè) prezzo nella media per il ristorante.
Abbiamo apprezzato moltissimo il drink offerto da consumare quando vogliamo durante il soggiorno. 

Albergo consigliato. 
Pro+ comodità, personale, servizio. 
Contro- collazione cara per chi prende soltanto un caffè alla mattina o comunque non mangia 15 euro di collazione :D 
-Il servizio taxi c'era uno a 45 e uno a 55 euro 
ovviamente non si sono fati scrupoli a farci prendere quello più costoso..

ci ritornerei.",5,2017,03,03
100,Bellissimo albergo,"Bellissimo albergo,ottima posizione, stanza grande, la signorina della reception parlava anche italiano, ci hanno offerto una bevanda a scelta da scegliere tra caffè, birra, vino, ottimo kit di benvenuto",4,2017,02,28
100,La meraviglia!,"La location è a dir poco meravigliosa!! Dentro a quella che sembra una vecchia chiesa si trova una struttura nuovissima. Camera tutta bianca, letto comodissimo, un bagno modernissimo con vasca da due persone per rilassarsi dopo una giornata in giro per la città. 
Lo staff molto cortese e disponibile.
Il bar molto bello con vista sul parco, se vi capita assaggiate il club Sandwich: ottimo! 
Unica nota negativa è l'espresso.. :( 
Lo consiglio a tutti e ci tornerò sicuramente.",5,2017,02,26
100,buen hotel,"Un buen hotel, la verdad es que nos sorprendió para bien. Las habitaciones bastante nuevas y reformadas. Y las chicas que nos atendieron en recepción encantadoras y serviciales. El wifi gratuito y bastante rápido. También cuenta con un bar-restaurante bastante acojedor y bonito, y de calidad. El hotel está a una media hora del centro caminando, pero cuenta con transporte público a 5min.",4,2017,02,25
100,Wir kommen wieder!,"Also uns hat das Hotel sehr gut gefallen. Es ist eine perfekte Mischung aus altem Charme und modernem Minimalismus. Leider wird zur Zeit ordentlich renoviert, sodass Teile abgesperrt waren und der Front Desk vorübergehend unter der Treppe zu finden war. 
Unser Zimmer war sehr schön, besonders das Badezimmer. Zwar etwas unpraktisch (Glaswände die trotz Verdunklung komplett durchsichtig sind und Tür welche sich nicht wirklich schließen lässt) aber wer vor seinem Partner eh keine Geheimnisse mehr hat der wird sich hier wohlfühlen. 

Unser Zimmer ( Flur 120-129) ging über zwei Etagen was ziemlich cool war. Sehr modern eingerichtet jedoch gab es doch Kleinigkeiten die auffielen, verfärbtes Waschbecken, Farbe auf den Fußleisten, Staub auf der Lampe. Nicht schlimm aber es viel auf. Der größte Knackpunkt allerdings war die furchtbare hellhörigkeit. Alles was auf dem Flur passiert klingt als wäre es direkt im Zimmer. Wer durch den Flur läuft, kann jedes Gespräch/ die Dusche/ die Toilette der einzelnen Zimmern hören. 

Das Frühstück war in Ordnung, klein aber ausreichend. Alles war Bio. Der Service beim Frühstück war mittelmäßig ,zwar waren alle super freundlich und lieb, aber nicht zuvorkommend. Teller wurden nicht abgeräumt und es kam generell niemand zum Tisch. Man müsste also selbst hingehen wenn man was will.

Alles in allem waren wir trotzdem  sehr zufrieden und würde gern wiederkommen. ",4,2017,02,21
100,Klassik trifft Moderne plus Baustelle,"Das Hotel an sich ist sehr schön und auch zentral gelegen. Jedoch wurde gerade viel im und außerhalb des Hotels gebaut. Glücklicherweise gab es keinen Lärm aber es sah einfach nicht schön aus.
Das Frühstücksbüffet kann ich nicht empfehlen! Für 17,50€ erwarte ich definitiv mehr Auswahl und vor allem mehr Service. Ich musste dauernd nachfragen wenn etwas leer war. Die Rühreier waren definitiv aus dem Tetrapack und schmeckten nach nichts, vor allem waren sie nicht frisch. Die Küche diente scheinbar nur der Dekoration. Auch die Abendkarte bietet sehr wenig Auswahl zu hohen Preisen. Insofern empfehle ich es auswärts zu essen. ",3,2017,02,21
100,Excelent hotel,"Eccellente hotel a 4 stelle, l'unica scomodità il luogo un po' fuori dal centro ma per il resto stanze bellissime, il check-in è stato veloce senza problemi parlando pure italiano. Ottime colazioni e abbondanti.",5,2017,02,19
100,Netter alter Kasten mit Umbaulärm,"Ganz gutes, in die Jahre gekommenes Hotel, ds gerade umgebaut wurde. Sehr gutes, vielfältiges Frühstück, liegt nicht schlecht, ca. 7 Minuten Gehzeit zur U-Bahn. Auch am Abend kann man an der Hotelbar ganz gut etwas trinken, allerdings nicht gerade günstig!",3,2017,02,17
100,Schönes Hotel,"Wir haben im November ein Wochenende in diesem Hotel verbracht und waren sehr zufrieden. Die Zimmer sind gross und elegant eingerichtet. Das Badezimmer war wunderschön. 
Ca. 25 Minuten bis zur Stadt zu Fuss.",4,2017,02,15
100,Toller Service - tolle Ausstattung,"Nach Reklamation aufgrund eines zu klein geschnittenen Zimmer , gab es ein Upgrade in ein Suite. Service top - Inneneinrichtung auch top. Mit dem am Hotel gemieteten Fahrrad ist man gleich in der Stadt.",5,2017,02,15
100,"Schönes Hotel, das sich momentan im Bau befindet.","Wir haben hier ein Wochenende verbracht und waren soweit ganz zufrieden. Das Personal ist wahnsinnig freundlich und serviceorientiert. Die Zimmerkategorien schwanken sehr. Wir haben ein normals Standard Doppelzimmer gebucht. Designtechnisch wird man nicht enttäuscht - sehr modern und geschmackvoll. Leider funktioniert nicht alles so gut. Die ebenerdigen Duschen setzen das Bad unter Wasser, was in einem extrem kleinen Bad zum Problem wird. Leider haben die Heizungen ein Lüftungsproblem und machen Geräusche. Wir bezogen erst ein sehr kleines, sehr süßes Zimmer, aus dem wir jedoch am Folgetag auszogen, weil die Matratzen nicht aufeinander passten und verrutschten :) 
Wir bekamen ein Update in ein doppelt so großes Zimmer mit wunderschöner Badewanne. Leider konnte man das Badezimmer nicht beheizen und fror sich so den A.... ab. 
Die Minibar im Zimmer ist leer. Die ""darf"" man laut Info selbst bestücken. Finde ich persönlich etwas schade und würde in dieser Preiskategorie zumindest ein Wasser auf dem Zimmer erwarten.
Das Frühstück war okay. Hier hätte ich mehr erwartet, empfand es aber als insgesamt zufriedenstellend. 
Das Haus, die Architektur ist wunderschön. Hier und da wird gebaut, was am Wochenende nicht hörbar ist.",3,2017,02,13
100,Hotel Arena,"Aunque  este a media hora del centro de Amsterdam merece la pena por lo bonito que es, y lo bien que tiene todo (servicio, habitaciones, etc). Hay buen nivel y se nota. Si volviera a visitar la ciudad repwtieka encantado. ",5,2017,02,12
100,Vacaciones,"El viaje estuvo muy bien, la única pega que encontramos fue que para poder ir en metro hay que andar un poco y, que si no quieres desayunar todo el buffet y pagar los 17€ (nosotros solo queríamos una tostada y un café) no te lo sirven, sólo puedes tomar el café.",5,2017,02,05
100,Wunderschön!,"Wir sind durch ein Angebot auf das Hotel aufmerksam geworden. Da wir eh nur eine Nacht bleiben wollten, haben wir uns dann mal etwas über unserer Preisklasse gegönnt. Ich hatte schon die Befürchtung als junger ärmer Student dort nicht ernst genommen zu werden, aber das Personal behandelt jeden Kunden gleich.
Das Zimmer war wunderschön vom Stil her und es hat uns genau so sehr zur Ruhe gebracht wie ein einwöchiger Urlaub.  
Ich weil zwar nicht ob ich den vollen Preis für das Zimmer bezahlt hätte, ohne Angebot, aber das zeigt sich dann bei meinem nächsten Amsterdam Besuch.  
",5,2017,02,03
100,Schönes Hotel mit klassischem Ambiente,Nach Beendigung der Umbaumaßnahmen im Oister Park direkt daneben ist dieses Hotel einfach wunderschön und nur zu empfehlen. Sehr edles Design mit individuell gestalteten Räumen und sehr eleganter Bar. ,4,2017,01,29
100,Very nice place,"Location molto bella, piccoli lavori in corso per migliorare ulteriormente l'hotel e già era tutto meraviglioso. Bravi!! Cafè e ristostante molto eleganti e con ottimo servizio..persino caffè espresso italiano di buona qualità! Una rarità 👍🏻",5,2017,01,29
100,Favoloso 😌,"Settimana stupenda in camera doppia su due piani , staff molto disponibile , hotel stupendo !
Ottima qualità prezzo , colazione abbondante e varia!
Sicuramente ci ritorneremo presto io e il mio ragazzo .
Siamo stati benissimo ",5,2017,01,27
100,Hotel molto piacevole,"Hotel molto bello attaccato al parco ""Oosterpark"". Quando sono arrivata in hotel mi hanno fatto un graditissimo upgrade, dandomi una camera molto spaziosa e luminosa. Il bagno molto grande con vasca da bagno e doccia, era fornito con ciabatte da camera, doccia schiuma, balsamo e crema corpo. In camera c'era anche un bollitore per l'acqua con bustine per il the e caffè. La colazione non prevedeva molta varietà e non vale quello che ti fanno pagare, mentre sia per il pranzo che per la cena siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti. Fuori dal hotel c'è la fermata del tram che ti porta in pochi minuti nel centro.",4,2017,01,22
