01,Well done and nicely located,"This hotel was newly renovated, so there are lots of great details throughout. The rooftop restaurant is gorgeous and I would highly recommend checking it out. 
my room was very well appointed plenty of room and a nice closet great bathroom, etc. comfortable bed nice pillows the  whole bit..
The lobby and sitting areas are very welcoming. You could actually just sit here all day and not go out and tour the unbelievable spots that are very close by.
But  you are after all, in Rome so as the saying goes, “When in Rome…”
 The location is amazing too, so you can access all the historical spots pretty easily by foot and the bus system works really well too if things are a bit farther away…

The concierge set me up with great tours. I highly recommend the golf cart tour that he suggested, especially on the first day just to get an idea of the city itself. 
The Breakfast was also well done.
I don’t have anything to say negative about this hotel",5,2024,10,04
01,Good choice for Rome,"Definitely a 5 star experience.  The hotel is immaculate.  Contrary to other comments, the room A/C is great.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect for walking to many restaurants ,shops and sites.  A very good choice for staying in Rome.",5,2024,09,17
01,STUNNING HOTEL!,"The design of this hotel was absolutely breathtaking!!! The interior, exterior and rooftop were so aesthetically pleasing!!! And it was perfectly located right next to the metro in a clean gorgeous part of Rome. Would definitely stay here again",5,2024,09,15
01,"If you aren't staying before a cruise, Skip it.","If you are heading out on a cruise this hotel is likely to be a good fit. If not, skip it as the people on the cruise take over the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and large and the hotel has a wonderful roof top bar and restaurant. The food is good and the views are fantastic. The staff is friendly but the big issue I had is that they cater to the cruise guests and we had one of their suites for a room. The cruise people took over breakfast shouting between one another and the poor waitstaff just rolled their eyes in sympathy with us. In the morning, we had difficulty pulling up our rental car to retrieve our bags because the cruise buses (yes buses) were blocking the entrance. ONe of the cruise staff was blocking the hotel entrance as if we weren't important because we weren't cruise guests. It's too bad really because otherwise the hotel is great and staff are friendly but seem powerless to controlling the cruise staff and guests to be aware that other people are spending quite a bit of money to stay here.",3,2024,09,04
01,Help and smile,Mauro the concierge helped us with a big smile even if we weren't clients of the hotel. We were having a drink while trying to sort out the stealing of a bag (with passport inside). That was an amazing level of service. A big thank you to him. So great to feel welcomed and helped.,5,2024,09,01
01,A lovely visit in Rome with great views,"Great location, wonderful hotel staff and concierge! Beautiful hotel with rooms available to overlook the square. Lovely views of the city and fantastic hotel staff that were able to deal with multiple flight and room updates. Enjoyed the experience tremendously. Would go back any time to visit this gorgeous hotel. They were able to book transfers to and from the ship, which was fantastic. Happy to have stayed here.",5,2024,08,15
01,"Great Hotel, Super Nice Staff, Excellent Location","Wonderful hotel. Like many, we stayed here before a cruise and were not disappointed. The hotel is really well placed located near the Spanish Steps/Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and only a 25ish minute walk to the Colosseum plus there is ample shopping in the area.
The staff are super polite and friendly. We arrived a little early and our room was ready for us. The room was nice and overlooked the fountain outside the hotel on the street. We were starving and the concierge suggested a restaurant off the beaten path for us that made fresh pasta and only used fresh ingredients and it was marvellous.
The restaurant in the hotel that served breakfast was unaware that I had an allergy to nuts and so the 1st day they didn't have much for me and I was slightly annoyed (but am used to this) and mentioned it to the front desk. They promptly called the restaurant and advised them we would be there for 2 more days and the following 2 days they made an entire separate plate for me with fruits and pastries all nut free which was really nice of them (and heavenly delicious).
It's known that hotels in Europe have smaller rooms and this was no exception but the room was clean and the bathroom was spacious. We did have to change rooms because the 1st room's AC wasn't cooling the room properly and the 2nd room was even nicer than the 1st. In fairness though, Italy was experiencing an extreme heatwave and everywhere we went was hot.
If I had one sort of ""concern"" for future guests it's that if you are a light sleeper, ask to not be placed in any of the rooms near the elevators because the walls are marble and sound carries into the rooms and when guests get off the elevator late at night, it's loud. This is not the hotel's fault but rather rude guests that are inconsiderate of other people.
Overall we were very happy at the Sina and would return. It's a great hotel whether you're there as a couple or as a family.",5,2024,08,08
01,Good stay with poor restaurant,"We stayed at the Bernini for a pre-cruise stay. Our room was not ready as we arrived early in the morning. This is to be expected when arriving so early or with a large group. Patience is required when traveling. The staff was friendly, warm and welcoming. The location of the hotel was wonderful. Bellman and concierge were always helpful and pleasant. Our room was clean and well apportioned. 
  The only downfall of our stay was the rooftop restaurant. We went for dinner and apparently our apparel was not good enough for them. They seated us at the very front of the restaurant, took our order, offered wine and brought our dinner. We never saw a staff member again. It was obvious we were not wanted there. Drink from the bar even came with pieces of something in it.  We picked over our dinner quickly and walked out.  Totally unacceptable. 
  The last straw was when they seated a couple beside us that brought their dog. This was clearly not a service dog. We weren’t wanted there but a dog was.",3,2024,08,07
01,Nice hotel but some things to consider,"We stayed here for three nights prior to going on a cruise.  First of all the staff was fantastic, always willing to go the extra mile.  We arrived pretty early on our flight and they did everything possible to expedite getting a room prior to normal check in.
Rooms were some smallish and aged as you would expect in an older hotel.  Rooms with connecting doors seemed to get a lot of noise from other room. 
Big issue that I have seen in most  older hotels, the lack of electrical outlets and they had USB ports for plug in rather than outlets next to the bed.  I don’t like those, to many stories of virus issues. You might want to bring a plug in adapter with multiple ports to extend.  All 220 of course so you will need a plug adapter.
They have a room top restaurant we were not able to try.  Restaurants in the immediate area are pretty limited.  Location is pretty central to the city sites but even the Triva (sp?) fountain and Spanish steps are maybe 10 minute walk which is tough in the summer unless you are young.   Taxi are interesting in Rome.  At the hotel they play by the rules, run the meter.  Anyplace else they may play by the rules or they may quote you a much higher take it our leave price at least twice the meter rate.  Uber is really expensive here, at least two to three times the taxi rate.  Metro stop next to hotel but if your mobility challenged, I did see an escalator or elevators.
Hotel is pretty pricey in my view but that may just be Rome prices in the summer.",4,2024,08,06
01,Perfect stay and we will be back there soon,"As the partner hotel of Brufani in Perugia we stayed on the way back home in this nice hotel for 2 nights. It is dominantly located on the top of a little square, on walking distance from Fontana di Trevi, Spanish Steps, Pantheon and many side streets with shops and restaurants.
The hotel ist beautiful. We had a renovated modern room. It features a restaurant on the roof top for breakfast lunch and snacks.
The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. Starting with the gentleman at the door upon arrival; the ladies at the reception presented such a friendly and professional welcome. Staying a third of my year in international hotels I never experienced a treat like this: Calling the Operator/concierge from the room as I was a bit confused about the WiFi login procedure for my phone - the gentleman first tried to give instructions by phone. Not getting it working he came up PERSONALLY to our room and personally logged on our two smartphones!!
The rooftop restaurant at the 8th floor breakfast offers a very good selction in a top food quality. The staff fullfills you very helpful all extra culinary wishes you have.
Even with the extreme outside temperatures we had just 3 perfect days in Rome and will come back to the Sina Bernini Bristol very soon again.",5,2024,07,31
01,"Wonderful, Clean, Central Location!","This hotel is wonderful. I would not hesitate to stay here again for business or family related travel. Wonderful area, close to just about everything. Amazing staff, clean rooms, great A/C. Wonderful concierge service. Limited Gluten Free options at breakfast BUT my coeliac children did not suffer...!

Do not hesitate to stay here.",5,2024,07,26
01,"Great service, beautiful hotel","This is a beautiful hotel with a nice lobby and chic rooftop bar with great city views!  The service here was excellent - everyone was very friendly and accommodating!  I will stay here again on my next trip to Rome!  Also, the location is fantastic.  Easy walk to so many things.",5,2024,07,09
01,"Waste of money and time, rude hotel staff, WiFi issues","Tired and old hotel. It smells of sewage if the bathroom door is closed. This is one of the hardest beds I have ever slept on. It gave me body aches for the remainder of my travels. The staff are not warm or friendly and borderline unwelcoming. I was throwing up by the end of my first day here. I ended up leaving my stay due to WiFi issues, the final straw. I understand early check in cannot always be accommodated, it was only when I asked to cancel the stay the room became almost immediately magically ready. The front desk phone is not consistently answered. I came down multiple times to ask about it and I was made to feel like it was user error until multiple other people came down with the same complaint. I missed my work meetings while this was being figured out. The hotel has no regard for guests time and energy. There was zero customer service in terms of offering any alternatives or a simple sorry for the inconvenience. At first it was give it a few minutes which turned to hours. I eventually decided to leave as I had a few more days of remote work before starting my vacation. I asked to speak with a manager since I had booked with points. I was told the manager is busy and I could leave and the stay would be refunded. I called Marriott to get my points back as I needed them to book another stay. Two weeks later I am looking at my account and the hotel has charged me again. Zero disregard for the time and inconvenience caused. The lobby photos are very deceptive. I ignored my better judgement after reading all the reviews on this property and booked it for my stay in Rome. I purposed $1000 worth of points to make up the balance in my account to be able to book this for a 5 night stay. That’s a lot of points! I also used suite nights to request an upgrade. I was very excited and hopeful that it couldn’t be as terrible as the reviews say. It was. The staff here do not seem to care about customers at all. And Marriott membership is essentially useless other than the breakfast benefit. I’m a Titanium Marriott Bonvoy member, for context, I stay at a lot of Marriott properties and have never experienced this level of disregard. The hotel is tired and old, when I asked if there were other rooms I could switch to, I was told I was in one of the newer rooms so that was the best. This is faaar from 5 star hotel. I should have booked an airbnb for way less and had better luck with those for the rest of my trip to Italy. I’ve called Bonvoy at least 7 times following my stay to follow up on the refund of both points and suite nights. By comparison, I left to the pantheon iconic Rome hotel which was way better. I also got to stay at le meridien visconti which was far better value. Do not waste your money on this property. It’s far from what one would expect at an Inn.",2,2024,07,09
01,5 star price 1 star return,"We were booked in the Bernini Bristol since July 3, 2023 for a June 24, 2024 arrival for three nights before our Silversea cruise.  We arrived at 10:30 am and waited behind guests for 13 minutes who were trying to secure rooms and were arguing about their room location or the fact that they had a teenager and were told they needed a second room.  A female at the separate concierge desk pulled us out of line apologizing  that our  room wasn’t ready and said she’d call when it was.  We’d been flying for 24 hrs at that point. No call received so at 3 pm (check-in time) we returned to the Bernini Bristol to find displeased guests in a long queue at the registration line and the female concierge who said she’d call three deep in guests. Exhausted, I walked over to the desk with three male concierges who appeared locked in a terse conversation with each other. As I approached the desk, one of the concierges put his hand up across the counter towards my face and said, “wait!” Offended, I immediately moved back to the registration desk line. The concierge ran behind hind the desk yelling. “Madam, you just needed to wait a minute.” I told him I did not want to speak with him. The female concierge came over and told me that when there is a stressful day that man is short and unpleasant. I reminded them that we paid a lot of money to be stressed by the Bernini Bristol and that rude man was being paid for his stress.  I proceeded to get our room key. My husband and I walked to our room to find we were in the corner of the sixth floor next to the elevator. The noise was so loud after a few minutes I would compare it to being next to the ice maker at a 1 star hotel. I went back and shared my concern and my husband and I were shown room 208- the only other room not booked. We took the room only to find that it was not a king but two unleavened full beds pushed together- we had to sleep separately and  on the edge or roll to the outside of the mattress. Our shower was in a tub, which had no curtain or glass ( there was glass at one time because there was a clothes line to nowhere in the tub). The shower head leaked all over the marble floor and we had to step out with greatest care not to slip to our demise. There was mold in the shower and around the sink, no place to unpack your clothes, one valet stand, and an awful smell from the bed skirt. 

This hotel assured us to never book a pre-cruise stay with Silversea again. 

The stories of other guests were just as unfortunate and I hope they share. 

Best thing about the hotel: the bellmen and housekeepers were gracious and tried to be helpful.  The location is great, but there are lots of much less expensive hotels that people we met said provided outstanding customer service in the same area.

Pick another hotel!",1,2024,07,01
01,Would stay again!,"Great location. Friendly, accommodating staff. Clean. Safe. Good sized rooms. We would definitely stay there again! Very walkable area and an upscale spot without being pretentious. 

My only comment was that the restaurant menu above was not what I was looking for for my first night in Rome… it was a fancy fusion of Japanese and Italian? It seemed like an odd combination. We were hoping for Italian but were too tired from traveling to go out.",5,2024,06,30
01,Our Stay at Sina Bernini Bristol,"We stayed at this hotel for five nights in May whilst awaiting our cruise.

The hotel is in a really good situation,  and while the staff were amazingly good as were the restaurants and food, the room was less than impressive. 

The air conditioning did not work and it was so hot, day and night We could hardly open the window because of the lock. 

The heat obviously didn’t bother us during the day as we were out. 

Nighttime though was a problem. The heat affected our sleep and when we did ‘open’ the window the constant noise of the buses /traffic kept us awake. 

The toilet also did not flush  properly.",3,2024,06,19
01,Great experience at San Bernini Bristol Autograph Collection downtown Rome,Great Service. Nice central location. Wonderful attention to detail by Front desk Veronica . She was the absolute perfect receptionist with smiles and welcoming remarks. I think her last name may have been Latif. I suggest you ask for her when you visit,5,2024,06,15
01,Unforgettable experience in Rome,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two day stay at this 150 year old boutique luxury hotel. The hotel is located on the Piazza Barberini and is a mere 5 minutes walk from the Trevi Fountain. The location is incredible. The main road from the hotel is beautiful and is perfect for shopping. Further, the hop on hop off buses leave from right outside the property.

The rooms were excellent along with attached balconies. For a heritage property, the rooms are very modern and comfortable and the upkeep at this property is excellent. The hotel is kept very clean and tidy by the excellent staff.

Service of the staff was exemplary. Starting from the checkin staff, restaurant staff, housekeeping staff to the incredible concierge personnel, everyone takes such good care of their guests. The concierge staff were especially very helpful in arranging tickets and providing valuable suggestions for dining options in the city. Our outgoing flight from Rome was early in the morning and the concierge arranged for a timely airport transfer for us while the whole city was asleep. We even had the porter help us with our luggage from our rooms at that odd hour. Service, therefore, was top notch.

Now coming to the food, words cannot describe the culinary experience we had at the Vil Vizio rooftop restaurant. The view from the rooftop is fabulous and the entire Rome skyline is visible from the roof, including landmarks like the St Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican. The food however is the highlight of this place. Mouthwatering delicacies await you with excellent service. We truly enjoyed a  memorable evening at the restaurant. The breakfast in the morning was also excellent.

Overall, this is arguable one of the finest heritage properties in Rome and I would recommend staying here for the great service, good food, and the incredible location.",5,2024,06,13
01,Great Location  Otherwise Cannot Recommend,"Okay, the location is awesome and the staff is very friendly, especially the doormen, valets and breakfast room attendants.  Beyond that, unfortunately this hotel has problems.  Our room was dark, dirty and worn.  There was a sewage smell in the hallway and our bathroom.  The bathroom was small and cramped.  Housekeeping response was very poor.  Breakfast was extremely bland with Holiday Inn style food.  Coffee was good though.  We would have checked out and left this hotel but it was booked as part of a cruise package which included transfer to the port.  Cannot recommend.",1,2024,06,06
01,Perfectly positioned,"We arrived after a long day travelling to be welcomed by the lovely staff and directed to reception. Check in done, and very quickly, we were shown up to our room. Lovely large room and huge bathroom. The hotel is perfectly placed to walk everywhere, but if needed there were plenty of taxis outside. We didn't eat at the hotel, but found the bar staff in the lobby very helpful! My only complaint was the A/C in our room which would not cool down enough. As we were only staying two nights we managed, but if it had been any longer it would have had to be dealt with.  I would also like to say thank you to one of your door staff who was very helpful when I explained that I had to urgently buy a new suitcase. He directed us to a local shop where we purchased a good suitcase at an excellent price. As a long term Marriott member I will be happy to return, as long as the A/C issue is solved.",4,2024,06,04
01,Skip this hotel,"This place is not even close to a 5 star hotel. This hotel should be a 4 star or less since it operates and looks like one. Upon arrival, the AC in our room was not working, and absolutely no one from the hotel warned us prior to our arrival or informed us before we went upstairs to find out for ourselves. Turns out the AC had been out all day. NO ONE was helpful from there on out. Every time I asked for an update on the AC situation, I was ignored or passed to the next receptionist at the front, who again, was of no help, offering no information or speaking no English (why would no one be able to speak English suddenly at a 5 star hotel in Rome?). We were offered nothing but a fan. No water was offered.
No help or ETA given. Even when directly asked if there was an ETA, they said they had no estimated time the AC would be fixed. But when our travel agent called their management, they gave a 2-3 hour ETA. Secondly, when we asked for another room, we were told by the receptionist that that was not possible as there were no other rooms. Judging by the reviews, looks like this hotel has numerous problems and hasn’t bothered to fix any of them. If this was a 3 or 4 star hotel, I’d give a little grace, but don’t call yourself a 5 star hotel if you act like this. Rooms were cheaply redone. Breakfast hosts were unfriendly. No one looked like they wanted to work there. The only friendly staff were the porters and housekeeping. The location is great, but take your money elsewhere. Horrendous service. Shocking that Marriott doesn’t have better quality control to ensure Autograph titles hotels are actually worth it.",2,2024,05,21
01,Excellant  choice,This hotel should be 5 *****.  The location is perfect for getting around Rome. The staff is very warm and informative. They welcome you with smiles and knowledge.  I needed to get cash and the concierge walked me one block to the bank get it. The concierge service is exceptional.   You will enjoy a wonderful stay if you choose to stay there.,5,2024,05,11
01,"Amazing hotel - great location, beautiful rooms, and great service","My husband and I stayed here with my parents for one night after arriving in Italy, and we LOVED this hotel. Location was excellent - walking distance to the Trevi fountain and plenty of other sights.

Room:
We used a Marriott Bonvoy Suite Night Upgrade and got the two bedroom Barberini Penthouse Suite, which was INCREDIBLE. It had a stunning view of the city, there was tons of space, it was beautifully decorated, and air conditioning was great. We were also able to check in early, which was great after traveling for 12+ hours. Wifi also worked well.

Food:
The food at the rooftop restaurant was excellent. The view from the rooftop terrace was also stunning. Breakfast was also great (complimentary with Marriott Bonvoy status), and included Prosecco. 

Service:
Service was great! Everyone was friendly from check in to check out. Hotel staff helped us with our bags on both ends of the trip, and was very quick and polite.

This hotel was excellent, and we will absolutely stay here our next time in Rome.",5,2024,05,11
01,My go to hotel in Rome,Amazing stay in Rome.  Each day we started with an amazing breakfast from Laura and her team.  The concierge service was always there with a recommendation or to assist us with everything from dining to an umbrella.   The rooftop offers excellent cocktails and wonderful sunset views.  Our room was comfortable and kept perfectly clean by the housekeeping staff.  We awoke refreshed day after day.  Again a great place to relax and enjoy The Eternal City.,5,2024,05,09
01,Stay in Rome in a museum looking hotel,"This hotel is luxury!! The hotel
Is a piece of art! So beautiful decorated 
The rooms are spacious with Beautiful views of the city, super comfortable beds
The staff is very professional and friendly
The breakfast is amazing, variety of food for every diet, everything fresh and healthy 
The Rooftop restaurant/bar has an amazing atmosphere and views of the city",5,2024,05,03
01,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel in a good location. Hotel is very clean and no complaints about the bedroom's. The hotel is expensive for drinks, above and beyond the prices around the area. Staff are very welcoming and there is always taxi's just outside the door. Plenty of restaurants and shops in the area.",4,2024,04,08
01,exceptional welcome and service,"Travelled to Rome to experience Easter in the Holy City, which was fantastic. What made the trip even more pleasant was the stay at Sina Bernini. The hotel location is within walking distance from all major landmarks and also has a metro station out the front door.
We've stayed at this hotels a few times now as the rooms are large, modern and come with all the facilities of a fine hotel. The service has always been great and this time we had the pleasure of being greeted by the quality director Jessica Berti, whom went above and beyond to welcome us and attend to all our requests. Thanks to all the wonderful team at this hotel they always make it feel like home. See you soon.",5,2024,04,05
01,Perfect hotel in Rome,"I’ve stayed in a LOT of hotels (worldwide) and this hotel is perfect.  Great combination of service, location, price and accommodations.  The rooftop bar / restaurant is excellent with great food.  And the staff is as friendly as anywhere.  It was my birthday and received a special note and a dessert from the staff and GM, Lorenzo Vivalda.",5,2024,03,17
01,Lovely 4 star but no 5 star hotel here,"Agree with other reviews. This is a lovely 4 Star hotel but for so many reasons, i won’t bash the hotel because the staff is lovely this is NOT a 5 star hotel. We stayed at two other 5 star hotels in Italy this trip, 1 in Rome and Florence and they are in a completely different category that are true  5 star hotels. Maybe Sina once was a 5 star hotel but that was a long time ago. Again if your looking at 4 star hotels this is in a good location and has nice lobby but once you get to the rooms and true housekeeping service it shows the real level of a 4 star property. 

Thankfully we were staying only 1 night on our way to the airport, i would not have been happy here longer personally it feels way to commercial touristy and amateur compared to the real thing we experienced the rest of our trip. Again it is a fine hotel but it bothers me when you try to make it something it is not. Unfortunately for my travel agent who booked it, she is one and done as a result.",3,2024,03,14
01,Beautiful Property and Exceptional location and staff,"I was robbed lost my 2 phones and Credit Card on 2nd January on Metro, I came to hotel and ask for immediately charge to card. The reception the curly girl was so nice and attentive, offered me breakfast in the morningand concierge as well. Please extend my thank you to her. Plan to stay 1 night and the next day we stay at other hotel. But then we come back again as exceptional location close to Metro and shops and cafes and service also very beautiful property.",5,2024,03,13
01,Business trip,"Now the location, Italian warmth, smiles and friendly faces were the positives points of my stay. Always great to have this in a hotel ,thanks to Cinzia at reception and a few others this made up for the many issues that plagued this hotel. I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and I have never experienced this from a so-called 5 star. The quality of the food, the lack of cleanliness, the noise from communicating rooms was as if the neighbor was in my room using my toilet(many of my colleagues experienced this on multiple floors), the in room setup (lights not working, cables badly connected and to make matters worse I couldn't call reception because the phone wasn't functioning properly (receiver cable kept falling out :-)) and when they managed to lose my laundry for one day (fortunately found) I was really frustrated to say the least. To have fresh air it was possible to open the windows yet unbearable to keep open because of traffic and noise in the streets. I ordered dine in service but I couldn't stomach the price for a simple piece of half toasted bread with a slice of tasteless ham and cheese. It is a shame because the staff are so smiley and friendly.",2,2024,03,11
01,Bad taste left,"Came as part of a group and in general the staff were accommodating and helpful.  Great view from the roof terrace..
BUT…and yes it is OUR fault….we we were stupid enough to leave not one, but TWO phone chargers in the room, plugged in with adapters etc…a couple of hours after departing we rang and told the hotel….we were returning to Rome the next day and said we would return to collect them….guess what…housekeeping said they weren’t there…well housekeeping, that’s just not true is it??!!  And you have just meant we won’t return to your hotel and neither will any of the 18 in our party.  Seriously, was it worth nicking a couple of phone chargers?  The concierge was suitably embarrassed when he told us.  Grazie.",2,2024,02,23
01,Perfect stay!,"We had a perfect stay here! We stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute! Comfortable bed, big room and bathroom. The hotel is perfect maintained and clean. The best is the staff, they really want us to be special and did their utmost to do this! We also had breakfast every day and the buffet had everything we could wish for. The staff spoiled us with orange juice, cappuccino and prosecco every morning! I am sure we will return!",5,2024,02,13
01,Great location ,"The location is great!!! It's about a 15-minute walk to the Trevi fountain.  The view from our room was fantastic. There are numerous restaurants nearby, and they close late,  which makes it possible to stay out late without having the fear of going back to the hotel hungry.  

The hotel staff were professional and friendly.  Because we arrived early, our room was not ready.  However, we were given a temporary room to rest while waiting. That was much appreciated.  

The design of the room is good but not impressive to think it's a five-star
hotel. The living room and bedroom are spacious.  However. the bathroom is quite tight, and I hate that I kept bumping my arm on
the hot towel rack each time. 

During the second day of our stay, we had a problem with the air-conditioning system because it seemed as though it was set at a certain temperature, which was too warm for us. It felt like only the fan was blowing. We brought it up, and they arranged for some guys to come in and fix it. It was not as cool as we wanted, but it was alright. This problem is something you shouldn't be experiencing in a 5-star hotel. It would have been a completely comfortable stay had it not been with the air conditioning issue. Overall,  it was a pleasant stay.

01,"Superlative Hotel in the right place; Piazza Barberini, Rome","Our four-night stay at The Sina Bernini Bristol was wonderful. The staff at the reception, at the breakfast room and the room servicing, are all so client orientated. 
The allocated room’s position covered the best view ever of Piazza Barberini.
 In addition, the all-round new look refurbishment is incredibly beautiful. Count down to the next stay has begun!!",5,2024,01,22
01,Less than Satisfied,"I’ve been to Rome multiple times and I prefer to stay at specific hotels however during my most recent trip my first choices were fully booked. I saw positive reviews with Sina Bernini Bristol Autograph Collection Hotel and took a chance. I regretted it soon after check in.

First off the price was equivalent to $900/night for a deluxe guest room. This is quite a steep price but I’m willing to pay if the experience is great. 

Check in was smooth and there were no issues. The staff were friendly and welcoming. It was at this time I requested late check out for the last day. I was told this would be no issue however it was never recorded in the system. On check out day there were several knocks at my room door and I was told the late check out time had not been recorded. I felt rushed to leave.

The room itself felt clean but I found the furniture and design to be out dated. The lights above the bed appeared to have been broken and they no longer adjusted properly. The bed was lumpy and lopsided. The electrical wiring in the room was awful. When trying to turn the lights on in the room I needed to flip the switch on/off multiple times. The walls to adjoining rooms and the hallway were paper thin. I could hear my neighbors in the toilet and people talking outside. Also the lack of rugs in the hallway meant I could hear every footstep. The doors to the hallway and adjoining rooms also had gaps at the bottom so I had to place towels on the ground in front of them to feel comfortable. The shower in the bathroom had an odd smell which I believe was caused by lack of ventilation for steam. These may all be minor issues by themselves but when lumped together considering the steep price I paid for the room, I was left feeling less than satisfied with the experience.

The hotel has restaurant options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They are located at the top of the hotel so the view is very nice. However, It is a trek to get to them. We had to go down multiple hallways and stairs/elevators to access them from the lobby. The food was good and there were plenty of options.

The location of the hotel is great. It is directly in front of Fontana del Tritone and there are many cafes/restaurants within a couple minutes walking distance. The subway station is also right outside. The Trevi Fountain is less than a 10 minute walk so it’s a great place if you want to stay close to the tourist areas but not directly in the crowds.

Overall I did not believe I the value of this hotel was worth the price so I was less than satisfied with my stay.",3,2024,01,19
01,"Hotel staff open your safe box, steals from you and management claims cameras stopped working","Only stay here if you want the hotel staff to break into your room while you are out and have the “do not disturb” sign out and steal the contents you placed in the safe then management claims that the cameras stopped working. Hotel management is without a doubt involved. Stay far away. This hotel is not safe. We had almost $1,000 USD stolen from the room safe: They will steal from you.

01,Wonderful! Best Location!,"This is my third time at this wonderful 5-star hotel, the second time as part of Bonvoy. I spent two nights and will be going back in February. My most appreciated experience was being given a room to use to relax as I arrived early from NYC and my designated room was not yet ready.  Any problems I had were quickly addressed and resolved, a true 5-star experience. Thank you! Breakfast was great and the selection had something for everyone.  Did not have the waffle this time! See you in February!",5,2023,12,17
01,Not Nice,"I wouldn't stay again in this hotel  for the bellow reasons
  
In general the rooms need to be renovated
The bed side table was broken
There was no duvet cover, instead there was a sheet above and bellow the duvet, 
   which means that if you move around during your sleep then you end up covering 
   yourself with the  dirty duvet without any cover at all. 
The plugs were not safe and were not fastened well on the wall
The wood on the floor needed repainting
Elevators were very old
The room in general wasn't very clean and the carpet around the bed also was dirty
Decoration in room was not nice, bright purple colour on the wall and generally decorative items are without any taste in my point of view.

Very expensive for what it offers.

Location is good however.

We asked to change room, which we did but the room provided was equally as bad.

01,A marvelous hotel in the hart of Rome,"It is the best hotel in Rome . Location is close to the main attractions and you can find in the vicinity lots of cafes and restaurants.It offers the best breakfast in town on the 8th floor . Staff make you feel at home extremely helpful and professional .  Warm thanks to Mr Marco Bratto front office manager and to Veronica Tawfik guest relations . Both of them are ready to go the extra mile for you . I had a wonderful room on the 5th floor with a magnificent view.  I am a titanium elite member in the Marriott group I stay in many hotel’s world wide but this hotel has something very special comfort and cleanliness. Moreover, It is a walking distance from the main shopping area in Rome . The aminities in the room are very generous and cover all what you think you may need. I can’t conclude without praising the professionalism of Sara De Donati  and Mario De Beuis . I do recommend this hotel for guests going for business or for leisure .

01,Excellent Experience-Wonderful Staff,"Just came back from a 5 night stay at this property. It recently underwent a complete renovation and is better than ever. The location in the Piazza Barberini is ideal and we were able to walk to almost every major attraction.  Bus and Metro adjacent to the hotel and a taxi stand directly in front. The neighborhood is safe, clean, and filled with plenty of places to shop and eat. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are among the best I’ve ever encountered. Our room, with a large terrace, was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was large and modern. I highly recommend this property and look forward to visiting it again soon. ",5,2023,11,06
01,Outstanding Customer Service,Really nice place and wonderful customer service. We had a party of 4 that ran into a little difficulty ...went to the front desk and Luea & Sizvia were there to help. After only a short time of explaining our problem; they both came up with a solution that was exactly what we needed. So if you ever run into any problems; ask for these two because they are the best customer service reps I have seen in a long time.  Thanks again to both of them.,5,2023,11,03
01,Wonderful Hotel,The Sini Bernini Bristol is in a great location. Very close to Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. The staff is wonderful and the hotel is clean and beautifully appointed. The beds and pillows are very comfortable and the amenities are excellent. The roof top bar and restaurant offer excellent views and great drinks and food. I loved our stay here and wish we were able to stay longer. ,5,2023,11,02
01,"Wonderful hotel, will be back!","Our experience at this hotel was superb! As a titanium member, to our delight, we got upgraded to a beautiful suite! The staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. The rooftop dining and view were stunning.

01,Great stay jn Rome!,What a lovely hotel!  The bed is supremely comfortable and the General Manager and all the staff very welcoming.  The location is central to much of Rome’s best sites. The extra touches make this a very special place. ,5,2023,10,19
01,Awesome hotel,The hotel was amazing.....all the staff was friendly and helpful to us all.  The breakfast was great and we were very grateful to be so close to the city center. The sushi on the rooftop was fantastic and extremely fresh.  5 stars all day baby 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟,5,2023,10,18
01,Great location and service,"This hotel is a large hotel at the top of the Piazza Barberini.  We stayed here one night as part of our Windstar cruise.   The staff was friendly and helpful especially the concierge.   The decor is modern which I did not really care for.  Or room was nice but the bathroom was exceptional with a deep soaking tub and separate walk in shower. 
We did find the soundproofing lacking and we could hear activity in the hall and room next to us.    The rooftop restaurant and bar has amazing views",4,2023,10,10
01,Best by far in Rome,"Sina Bernini was everything I hoped for a more! Large, very clean rooms with great amenities! No stone unturned in terms of details, from providing shoe buffer to sewing kit. And I simply couldn’t get over the Lorenzo Villoresi products in the bathroom! They smell so fresh, I found myself showering twice daily just so I could bathe in the scent. And to top it all off, the staff was amazing! From the moment I stepped out of the taxi and was greeted by a very friendly and professional doorman, to Silvia, Luca, and Jessica…it was a truly amazing experience. I’d DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this place to anyone visiting Rome! And the proximity to all places of interest is unmatched! ",5,2023,10,09
01,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Rome!,"We chose this hotel, mainly because of its convenient location and the Marriott affiliation. However, I will now be recommending this beautiful hotel to all my friends and family planning a visit to Rome. Situated right on Piazza Barberini, and in the heart of central Rome, this beautiful hotel is conveniently adjacent to the Barberini Metro station, and just a short walk from the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and many other historic sites. The hotel itself is elegantly appointed, and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff greeted us warmly throughout our stay, and were always extremely helpful and courteous. One of the best attributes, however, is the rooftop “Il Vizio” restaurant. The sushi-forward fusion menu, combined with a breathtaking view of the city and top-notch service, was among the highlights of our entire trip. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,09,26
01,Rooms not ready at 3:00pm check-in as we were advised.,"Worst hotel experience for a Marriott brand I’ve ever had. My wife and I arrived in Rome, Italy at 9am the day of our reservation.  We toured the city, had lunch and returned to the lobby at 3:00p check in time. We were told the room was still not ready. As we waited in the lobby, we watched more than 20 people check in, get a key and head to the elevators. Not until I contacted the closest W Hotel that was .5 miles away, did the front desk made a real effort to get us into our rooms. Would never stay at this hotel again.",1,2023,09,23
01,Authentic  Stay,"If you want an authentic stay in Rome. Stay here. It is a historic hotel with over 140 years of history.  Just 10-15 min easy stroll to Rome's top attractions including The Pantheon, Trevi fountain, Piazza di Spagna and many other historic spots. The hotel has retained authentic touches, seen on each floor but what stood out most for us was the hotel team; Fabio at the Front Desk who was of great assistance, Marco at the  Concierge who gave valuable hints and tips on where and how to go , and Veronica in guest relations spreading smiles all over the place. The hotel staff are exceptional we felt very happy to return here at the end of the day. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else if we return to Rome.",5,2023,09,21
01,A nice hotel with great rooftop bar,"Beautiful hotel. In a nice area.  It was a 15 min walk to Trevi fountain and Spanish steps.  About 45 to 50 minute walk to Vatican.  Staff was nice.  They have a great rooftop bar & restaurant. While we did not eat at the restaurant, we went up every night to watch the sunset.  One of the best views in Rome!  They made great craft cocktails.  The bartender,  Ellieinatir (not sure on spelling) was super welcoming and is a great mixologist!.  She was awesome!",5,2023,08,22
01,"Good Location, but not 5 Star","We were a little apprehensive booking the Sina Bernini Bristol based on the reviews, but have been pretty loyal Bonvoy members (typically stay 40-50 nights in hotels per year). Unfortunately, the negative reviews are pretty spot on. 

The Good: 

The hotel is well located in Piazza Barberini, which is walking distance to most Roman sites (Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps). There is a beautiful roof top terrace that overlooks much of Rome and you can easily see down to the Vatican. We didn’t have breakfast there, but did enjoy the drinks, which we very nice. The two rooms we had looked recently renovated and had nice updated decor / furnishings. The bathrooms were large and we had a very nice waterfall rain shower. 

The Bad:

The house keeping generally was very spotty. Some days, housekeeping was knocking on our door at 7:30am and other times the room wasn’t cleaned until 4pm. Used cups would be picked up, but then not replaced. Tea bags and water were not always replaced. One time it took 1 hour and three calls to get 2 tea bags for afternoon tea. We had room service in the room one morning and the croissant crumbs (clearly visible) weren’t vacuumed for two days. Additionally, the service was very hit or miss. One of our rooms had a strange smell coming into the room and was clearly not getting cold (AC is a common complaint at the hotel). We complained several times during our 4 days, but both of these issues were never resolved. Additionally, the concierge really wasn’t helpful. Their restaurant recommendations all focused on super touristy / mediocre food - a cynical person might speculate that they were getting some sort of kickbacks by sending unsuspecting tourists to average establishments. All recommended restaurants were a massive disappointment. As others have noted, there is no pool at the hotel, which at this price point is unusual for a 5-star establishment. 

In all, while the hotel is well located, I don’t think we would return here. There are much nicer (and friendlier) places at this price point.",3,2023,08,19
01,Location is great - staff are even better,"This hotel made me overcome my lifelong ambivalence about Rome. From the charming welcome to the comfort (and quiet!) of our room, I appreciated Rome as never before. The staff must be mentioned - uniformly friendly and eager to help (Luca from the front desk personally guided us to the excellent rooftop restaurant when we were unsure of how to get there and Veronica at the front desk was also extremely helpful and patient). The location is excellent - just a few minutes's walk to Trevi Fountain,  Spanish Steps, and other sites. The shower was phone booth tiny, but the bathroom itself was quite spacious and attractively designed. ",5,2023,08,10
01,Classic centrally located hotel,"Beautiful hotel, centrally located, next to the metro. Easy walking distance to Spanish steps and Trevi fountain. Old historic hotel, freshly renovated. Great Wi-Fi and buffet breakfast with freshly baked pastries by older lady in open kitchen. Service from check in, front desk and bellman was exceptional. Special shout out to Veronica and Luca at the front desk. Both were accommodating, pleasant and professional. The hotel itself is actually part of the big bus tour. Received two upgraded rooms as Marriott platinum members. Highly recommend.",5,2023,07,29
01,Invasion of guest privacy,"I had an unfortunate experience during my stay at the Sina Bernini Bristol that left me deeply disappointed and concerned. During my stay in May, a housekeeping employee barged into my room at 9:45pm without any notice whatsoever, which was already unsettling. To make matters worse, they started yelling at me in Italian, and the only word I could understand was ""polizia"" (police). They then proceeded to attempt to open the bathroom door where my fiancée was showering. This was a terrifying and bewildering situation, and it left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and unsafe in my own hotel room.
What made this experience even more disheartening was the lack of action from Marriott and the hotel management to address the situation. I promptly reported the incident to the hotel staff, expecting them to take it seriously and offer some form of resolution. I’ve also been in contact with Marriott multiple times now. However, to my dismay, they seemed dismissive and didn't show any urgency in addressing the matter.
As a frequent traveler, I value safety, security, and respectful customer service. Unfortunately, this particular stay fell significantly short of meeting these expectations.
I sincerely hope that Marriott and management from Sina Bernini Bristol take this feedback seriously and implements necessary changes to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. Guests deserve to feel safe and respected during their stays, and I hope my review serves as a wake-up call for the hotel management to prioritize customer safety and satisfaction.
Please be cautious and vigilant during your stay at this hotel. Your well-being matters, and it's essential to raise awareness of any concerning incidents for the betterment of all guests.",1,2023,07,27
01,Thank You,"This was a short stay.  Only three days. I’m already planning my return. Everything about this Hotel is the best!!!! The manager, assistant manager and everyone was the best possible!  This is a 6 🤩place to stay. Kisses to Lorenzo Vivaldi GM. and Marco Bratto. We hope to see you very soon. Arrivderci",5,2023,07,15
01,Bernini close to the attractions ,"We were lucky to get a room in the hotel Bernini during post-pandemic Peak summer season in Roma. Yes, it's crazy crowded.

Located in Piazza Barberini it's close proximity to all of Rome's magnificent attractions : Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Borghese Park, Coloseum.

We booked Deluxe King room with terrace. It was 100°F when we arrived. Thankfully they have AC!

There's a rooftop bar and restaurant for drinks, dinner and also breakfast.

Housekeeping could be better. It was a bit unclean for our standards. Although staff could be helpful. The concierge was a wee bit inconsistent. Hey, they're learning on our time.

Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel is now affiliated with Marriott Bonvoy Brand

01,"Fabulous stay for multi-gen family at Bernini Bristol, Rome","Iconic Music industry multi-gen family with high expectations came, stayed and left with warm, happy hearts because of the friendly, attentive hotel staff and General Manager. So many details went into this stay, and so many hotel staff from the Reservations Team, the amazing Concierge team, the restaurant etc were instrumental in the success of this vacation at Bernini Bristol Rome. Thank you to everyone and thank you to Bernini Bristol's General Manager Mr. Lorenzo Vivalda. Grazie mille! ",5,2023,07,06
01,A true gem in the heart of Rome!,"My expectations (as a frequent traveller) were more than met!!
Let’s start with first impressions: the staff at reception and the porter were welcoming and cordial upon arrival. Check-in was quick and my room was immediately ready. I read a lot about A/C in previous reviews, and I must admit that my room’s A/C was working fine, and the temperature was adjustable for my standards. I guess this is very subjective and depends on how cold is “cold” based on personal preferences, but certainly I cannot say that the A/C wasn’t working. My room was recently renovated, with a contemporary feel and everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Breakfast was served on a panoramic food hall with views looking over a lovely Palazzo. The quality was good and there was plenty of choice between savoury and sweet items. During the evening I also had a chance to have a drink at the rooftop bar, where I was greeted by a cordial gentleman (can’t remember his name!) where I enjoyed a divine margarita overlooking Rome. Priceless! All in all I must say that my stay, as brief as it was, was great. The super central location really made it easy to go about my business in the city center. Will recommend to family and friends!",5,2023,07,03
01,Not a 5-star hotel,"I would say our experience was more 3 stars, or average, however minus one point for how expensive this hotel is for what you get. Do not come here expecting a luxury hotel. Rooms are very small, air conditioning barely works (we're lucky we had an alley-facing room without direct sun), and the bathroom sink faucet handles were broken in our room so there was a constant trickle of water the whole stay. 

Service is just alright. No one was rude but something as simple as scheduling a taxi to the airport in the morning had staff disagreeing with each other on what to do.

We had an odd experience at the restaurant. We went up to see if we could just get drinks at the bar, and a kind server let us know they were fully booked. In the middle of her giving us other recommendations and also pointing out where the breakfast room is, who I'm presuming to be the manager of the restaurant stormed in, swearing on the phone, then started yelling (actually yelling) the nice server's name for her attention, interrupting her right in front of us. It sounded like the owner of the hotel was coming and they were very stressed. This gives me no confidence that the wait staff at the restaurant are treated well. On our way out we heard this man continue to yell at all of the wait staff he walked by.

The location is good but stay somewhere else when you're in Rome. You can get much better for a lower price point!",2,2023,07,02
01,Tired unclean hotel and way too expensive for what it offers,"The good

Some of the workers are pleasant and helpful 
Good location 

The bad 

The hotel is generally dirty and has an “unclean” feel to it 
The food was average at best 
The bed was uncomfortable 
It has a tired feel to it 
Some of the workers don’t smile and don’t seem to be happy working there
The wifi is patchy",2,2023,06,27
01,Worst Marriott Hotel...Don't waste your money!,"Worst Marriott Hotel... They should train with The Perry Lane Hotel in Savannah about real hospitality. No apologies about not having a room ready. not even water. The room is warm, and there was no coffee in the room. I can't say it enough, don't waste your money here. A Courtyard, Ac or Four Points by Sheraton are an upgrade from this hotel. The staff is clueless and has a bad attitude, completely arrogant.  They all need urgent training, or maybe all need to be fired. There is no leadership or quick thinking. As a Titanium member, we are used to great hospitality. Cuddos to Osvaldo at the door who was the only employee who was warm and friendly and could think on his feet. We will never stay here again. 1st night and the last. ",1,2023,06,25
01,Skip this hotel not worth the price premium,"Definitely not an ‘Iconic Luxury Hotel’!!! Avoid this hotel it’s horrible and I think they may be anti gay.  We were told pretty much to get off the rooftop bar they were sold out of drinks.  We spent an equivalent of almost 5K for 4 nights of horrible service. AC that didn’t work. Moldy welcome fruit.  They almost took our luggage to another room, luckily we saw it and stopped it. We checked out early to headed to another property.",1,2023,06,23
01,Definitely not what I consider a luxury hotel.,"We chose this hotel from United’s Mileage Plus Luxury World Hotel Collection.  What a joke.  Tiny tiny room.   Single sink in bathroom with no shower; (Hand spray that you had to hold if you wanted to wash your hair and body). The closet had a sheet as a cover instead of a door! Thank goodness we had shipped our big luggage pieces back home by that point in our vacation b/c they wouldn’t have fit in the room with us!  The daily breakfast provided was also a joke, food was horrible unless you wanted to subsist on pastries.    The positives that I will say is that the concierge staff were all very helpful and it is a good location.",3,2023,06,13
01,Resting on their laurels,"We stayed for four nights at Sina Bernini Bristol. While the location was very good and the decor was attractive, the hotel showed wear and tear, and service levels did not meet expectations. When we arrived, check-in was conducted in a non-welcoming, frosty fashion. Our room was not clean to what one would expect from a hotel of this class. The shower had black mold along the shower bottom and visible dirt accumulated on the outside. Dust balls and a previous guest's sock were on the floor, which indicated the floor had not been cleaned. The walls showed chips in the paint, and the door frame had broken piece of wood. There were only three elevators; one was out of service during our stay, one was dedicated to the hotel team, and the other we had to wait for constantly.

We would have overlooked all of this, but the main reason why we would never stay here again is the guest room doors which slam hard and loudly. When the door closes, it closes slowly, and then on the last foot, it sharply slams close. Everyone on our floor, including the housekeeping team, would let their doors slam shut. Also, we could hear every conversation in the hallway. It was disruptive and created an atmosphere we could never relax. We left the hotel sleep deprived and wishing we could get home to some peace and quiet.
The rooftop restaurant and lobby bar both missed the mark. We made a reservation for dinner there one night. We arrived on time and were surprised when the man who greeted us told us to ""relax"" and have a drink and pointed to a table where he could sit us later. We were unsure why he encouraged us to sit at a bar table when our table was ready. I read between the lines and interpreted it as he and his staff were not ready for dinner service. We had two drinks and then asked to be seated. He seated us at a completely different table that was off to the side near a wait station. We asked to move to the table he said he originally had for us as there were barely any other people in the restaurant. Our waitress was new and being trained by another man. He had her on a short leash, and she seemed unsure of herself throughout the service. Early on in the service, I noticed this man and his female trainee pointing at customers and laughing at them. I observed this three times, and unfortunately, we were included in the mix of customers which they laughed and pointed at. We did not order any more food or drinks past our mains, nor did we return to the restaurant for the duration of our stay. 

We did give the lobby bar a try and were equally disappointed. My drink was served in a cracked glass, and our food never arrived. After waiting for over 30 minutes, we canceled our order and left. 

Regarding service, the only people we can commend are the doormen, who gave a warm welcome each time we returned to the hotel. Except for the day we left, the doorman who was there when we departed looked straight at us and did not offer to help hail a taxi or with our luggage. 

It is a crying shame to see a hotel have so much potential rest on its laurels and simply not try to meet even the bottom rung of service, maintenance, or cleanliness. ",2,2023,06,12
01,Hotel without hospitality,"My observation is that everyone that works at this hotel is miserable and hates their job.  We felt like we were just an inconvenience, although we never asked for anything.

2 out of 3 elevators didn’t work.

The rooms are definitely worn out and small.  Lots of scratches and marks on the walls, dirty windows, and a mattress that probably dates back to when the property first opened. Shower experience is scary, I almost fell through the glass doors because the showers are so narrow and poorly designed.

This is not a luxury hotel, so don’t be fooled by the the high price.  

They do not offer an iron or ironing board.",1,2023,06,06
01,"Great location, nice hotel","The hotel is in an excellent location for Bernini fans. With one fountain directly in front and many other Bernini sculptures within walking distance, it's perfect. The hotel staff is helpful and our room was quite nice. The breakfast was lacking however and I wouldn't recommend it with so many other restaurants quite close.  There is also some great shopping streets nearby.",5,2023,06,04
01,Housekeeping is mia,"The front desk , the concierge , the restaurant for breakfast are all wonderful 

The housekeeping is not very good in fact poor 

As a long time Marriott / Bonvoy member our room shockingly wasn’t ready until 3 pm for check in 

Previous days after check In our room wasn’t taken care of until after 3 pm and often personal items for necessity weren’t replaced 
Despite asking housekeeping to refill them

Bonvoy you can do better 
We shouldn’t have to go to a store to get basic bathroom necessities",3,2023,05,26
01,Terrible Experience,"Our room was not as depicted in the website pictures -  ""urban view"" is actually a view of a dark ally way.  The room was tiny and run down.  We had also booked a king size bed and were given a double.  When we shared our confirmation information with the front desk they were beyond rude and unhelpful.  Apparently it was our problem that they put us in the wrong room.  

This is not a 5 star hotel and the staff do not seem to realize that they are in a customer service business. We do not recommend this hotel for anything other than it's location.",2,2023,05,19
01,Not the service you would expect,"We arrived at the hotel early due to a transfer from Sorrento that morning and were advised that check in would be at 3 pm.  They happily stored our bags and we set off for the day.  We returned to the hotel around 4:30 pm and our room was still not ready and they said it would be at least another 1/2 hour.  One of the reasons we booked this hotel was for the rooftop bar and restaurant, so we asked if we could just go have a drink up there while we waited.  The front desk did not advise us that it was closed for a private party.  We were turned away at the bar on the rooftop and sent back downstairs.  After dinner, we returned to the rooftop, but it was so crowded and overrun with people that it was not even enjoyable.  The bartender was even too busy to let us pay for our drinks.  I'm a Platinum member with Marriott, so I expected just a little more from the service here, but did not receive it.  The location is convenient and the rooms are updated.  ",3,2023,05,08
01,"Deteriorating standards, beware","We were part of a group who stayed in this hotel. We heard complaints from many in our group. For us, when we checked in at 3, there was partly finished food left outside opposite our room. At around 10, when we came back to the hotel the food was still there. Everyday, my husband and I like to drink tea. We were given 5 teabags at first. Everyday when some were used, they were not replenished, until we had no teabags after 3 days. Other people complained of rude concierge service, rooms that were not cleaned until 5 pm. Our group organizer who have used this hotel quite a number of times concedes that the standards have depreciated markedly. Only bright spot, the rooftop restaurant boasts a spectacular view and the food did not disappoint. One of the 5-stars given to this hotel should be confiscated, if not for the good location.",2,2023,05,07
01,No longer Dolce or Vita.,"Right in the heart of what was La Dolce Vita Rome of the fifties and sixties this luxury pile was our base in Rome twenty five years ago. The intervening years have not been kind.
Not that the hotel has declined physically or service wise.
The renovation and frankly odd colour and furniture themes do not suit it or me.
From the vital and bright hotel I remember, the dark and darker colour schemes just make it gloomy. Let's hope the next renovation celebrates La Dolce Vita rather than Nero's funeral as it currently does.",3,2023,05,04
01,Lovely hotel in perfect location,The Sina Bernini Bristol is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Upon checking in I was upgraded to a lovely and spacious suite. All employees were helpful and courteous. I highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Rome.,5,2023,05,02
01,Rude welcome,"Visited this hotel as extending stay in Rome and considered a booking here. BUT met by extremely rude and arrogant manager in rooftop bar. Greeted with ‘ladies are you residents, No?  I’m afraid this is a very exclusive hotel but shhhhh I will still serve you this time’. Would you have said this to two men visiting this establishment , I think not.  I would like however to compliment the doorman who welcomed us and showed us to the rooftop bar initially 
 I have visited many exclusive hotels but I do not believe this is one of them !",2,2023,05,01
01,Fantastic hotel in an amazing location,"Currently staying at this wonderful hotel. We received an upgrade to a suite upon arrival which has a comfy sofa, dining table that seats four and a kind sized bed. We found all stall to be very polite. My only complaint would be is that there are not enough plugs and a mirror over the desk/dressing table would have been preferably. I would definitely return to this amazingly located hotel",5,2023,04,22
01,Great stay and location,"The Rooms were lovely, large and had plenty of closet space.  A large bathroom and the windows in the bedroom opened to let in a breeze.  There is a safe in the room, and a mini fridge with, soft drinks, beer and alcohol all a charge, prices can be found in their book on the desk.  Bed is firm but not uncomfortable.   Staff is wonderful, kind, helpful.  The bar in the lobby is small but lovely.  Location is stellar, great restaurants all around, subway stop across the street.  
My only negative is their internet service is horrible almost nonexistent.  ",4,2023,04,20
01,3-star hotel masquerading as a 5-star,"I really, REALLY, wanted to like the Bernini Bristol more, but is just didn't meet expectations and there is so much room for improvement.  Initial communication from the staff was disappointing; I asked for a crib for my infant daughter and they made it seem like the most difficult task on the planet.  No recognition of my Marriott Bonvoy status (Platinum) until I asked about breakfast.

Room was just okay but missing the nice touches for a supposed 5-star hotel.  No artwork, minimal plugs, no USB charging, fixtures were worn.  Shower had a weird configuration with the faucet in the middle of the tub and a half-partition, so water splashed easily on the floor.  Cleaning was mediocre as the night light showed lots of dirt/dust on the mirror above the bed.  General maintenance should be improved; the runner/transition piece between hallway and bathroom was damaged.  (see my pictures)

The hotel also seemed cheap by not having the air conditioning turned on in the hotel.  (It was unseasonably warm when we visited in late March.  Not as hot as the summer, but our room got sunlight most of the day and didn't cool off well at night, making it hard to sleep).

Breakfast was just okay, again a 3-star experience, not even close to a 5-star hotel.  Coffee was mediocre (cappuccinos the first day came out cold).  Some of the cereal containers were broken and the staff just told us to scoop from the top.  Overall service from the staff was just okay, but nothing proactive.

Coming back most nights relatively early (for our daughter's bedtime), my wife and I would grab a glass of wine at the lobby bar (to bring up to our room).  The bartender there was missing frequently and seemed disinterested.  

On the positive side, location is great, close-by to so much in central Rome.  The lobby is really pretty and well designed.  We sadly didn't get up to the rooftop bar but it looks fantastic.  And the bellmen / concierge staff were extremely helpful and friendly (always helping with bags and the stroller for my daughter).

So nothing was really bad or wrong, but the experience was ""just okay"".  As said previously, I expected and was hoping for more.  If you see a great deal and you'll be out sightseeing a lot, no problem staying here.  But if you're looking for a true 5-star experience and want to enjoy the property more, then look elsewhere.",3,2023,04,18
01,"Dated interior, poor front desk service, not a 5-star luxury hotel, pictures are deceiving","Decided to splurge on this hotel as I assumed a $700/night hotel would have an amazing room, service, and breakfast but came away extremely disappointed after our 3-night stay.

As a Platinum Elite member, I asked for a room upgrade at check-in and was denied. I was told I got a renovated deluxe room. As you can see in my pictures, our room looked nothing like the deluxe rooms pictured on their website or in the Marriott app while I was booking. It was dark, dated, small, and the desk is directly behind the bed so you’re just looking at the back of the headboard.

I asked if I could get more bottles of water, and the front desk guy basically laughed at me and told me I get 1 bottle of water per day and that’s it.

Room Wi-Fi is terribly slow. Don’t expect to be able to do any work. Websites won’t load.

Breakfast was mediocre.

When you register to use Wi-Fi, you have to give your email address. You’re then sent a survey to give feedback on how your stay is going, but that link doesn’t even work and gives you a 404 error.",2,2023,04,17
01,Beautiful hotel  at Piazza Barberini,"This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to many sights and 5 minute walk to some great restaurants. 

We enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is nicely furnished and we stayed in the 'new tower', or new wing. Service was quite good with one exception, which I attribute to language and training issues. 

We had a hiccup with the electricity going out completely for about 90 minutes, but the electricians fixed it once they were finally asked to come up (had to access a ceiling panel and push the GFCI reset button, which is typically on the wall sockets in the US). That's something the hotel can educate their staff on, as the front desk was convinced it was a card software problem and kept sending up reprogrammed cards, which delayed getting the issue resolved for about an hour--when in actuality I kept telling them it was a ground fault circuit interrupter issue (GFCI) due to a short. I kept searching for a GFCI reset in the room, but I guess in Italy they put them up in the ceiling. 

Aside from that snafu, we had a great time. Its a beautiful building right across from the triton fountain.  Very interesting interior design, lovely library area off the side of the lobby, and of course a terrific location in the heart of the Trevi area of Rome. I would stay here again next time I am in Rome.

01,"Location, location, location & pricey","The Sini Bernini Bristol hotel was built in 1874 and is well located in the centre of Rome near the Fontana Trevi. The traditional city hotel offers 127 room and seems to be in a permanent state of renovation. Furnishings and decoration provide a nice atmosphere. Staffs are friendly and helpful.

We were upgraded to a junior suite on the first floor. The tastefully furnished & decorated suite had: wardrobe, bench that can be turned into an extra bed, large TV on the wall, desk & chair, fridge & safe, thee facility & Segafredo espresso machine, and an excellent king size bed & bedlinen. We had a separate bathroom with bath, double washbasin, shower, toilet & bidet. All was very clean.

The window can be open in safety mode. Complimentary bathrobes & mineral water in the room and good Wi-Fi. At the 8th floor a good Italian breakfast is served: eggs & bacon, cold cuts & cheese, rolls & toast, cereals, fresh fruits, milk & yoghurt, juices & preserves, tea and coffee.

We found the Sini Bernini Bristol very comfortable and we had a good stay. With its high pricing policy the hotel is far from value-for-money.",4,2023,04,15
01,Not 5 Star…,"Great location and some lovely staff  but overall not a 5* experience.

Hotel still undergoing extensive renovation work which I think it would be courteous to inform guests of in advance. One particular morning hotel guests were left in complete disarray as the normal entrance and lift to breakfast was closed for building works. Inadequate notices left us chasing around the hotel ‘fawlty towers’ style trying to find an alternative route to breakfast on the 8th floor. We were not the only guests bemused by this experience!

Room was ok but the bathroom was very cramped and there was no Wi-Fi or air conditioning.  Told they would only switch air conditioning on after Easter as Rome is not hot until then. Whilst Rome might not be hot, the room was unpleasantly warm and the very noisy road made it impossible to sleep with the window open. The  door slamming mentioned in other reviews was also not conducive to sleep (soft close?)

Rooftop bar was closed as part of the renovation and the lobby bar seemed to be hosting a private event most nights. It was made clear to me and my children that  we were not welcome in the  bar  during these events and the only option was to sit elsewhere in the lobby. The lovely bar staff did make sure we were looked after despite not being able to enter the bar as paying guests of the hotel.

Overall I am not clear what type of guest this hotel is trying to attract. We are a family of 4 and I would not recommend to other families with children. The loud private events and the upgrading of Instagram influencers (beware their ‘amazing reviews’ on this site) suggest the hotel isn’t particularly interested in families and ordinary paying guests.
",2,2023,04,06
01,A must stay hotel!,"I can not fault the hotel, my stay was excellent. I stayed in a one bedroom suite with city views and the room was outstanding and extremely spacious. All the staff were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay great. The hotel is in fab proximity to all the main sites and right next to a metro stop. The downstairs bar was great but due to the time of our stay and weather we did not use the rooftop bar but did look at it and loved the views of the city.",5,2023,04,05
01,Style and elegance,"We had a wonderful stay at the Bernini. The staff is particularly professional and welcoming. Wonderful view on rooftop. Excellent dinner (Fabio is a wonderful host, trust him for choosing the wine). It is also very pleasant to have breakfast on the highest floor, yet in a different place than the restaurant. Therefore, you enjoy a view of Rome but with a slightly different flavor. And if it happens that it is your birthday, don't miss the dinner there... Fabio will get a surprise for you.",5,2023,04,03
01,Won’t be returning,"We stayed at the Bernini for 5 nights, and while the property is is a good location and common areas look nice, I wouldn’t stay here again, nor would I recommend it to friends or family. 

The 2 main issues are horrible Wi-Fi and the air conditioning system not being turned on in our section of the hotel. We had asked for room fans or to move to an area of the hotel with operating AC.  Neither request was granted.

Other issues included spotty housekeeping, poor bathroom (towel hook fell off, multiple towels with holes), and very loud corridors with doors that are hard not to slam.

Another thing to consider is the breakfast.  It was the exact same offering every day.  For the cost, I would have expected some variety.  The cappuccino was very good, though.  If you’re choosing a status reward, I’d go with the points and grab breakfast elsewhere.

Overall, not a 5 star experience.",3,2023,04,01
01,Never Again,"The good, nice location. The bad; rude staff, property dated, dirty room, lack of maid service and room supplies, overall poor attention to detail. Did I already mention rude staff? Frequent traveler here but seldom encounter staff this bad. Management should be embarrassed. ",1,2023,03,23
01,Stay Away,"From check-in to check-out, entire experience was horrible…rude staff, poorly operated, unclean facilities. Front office manager - Marco Bratto - was rude and entirely unable/unwilling to address issues. His inability speaks to weakness of GM as well. Don’t expect much of this property.",1,2023,03,20
01,Beautiful hotel in a great location. ,"Fabulous suites, huge comfy bed and lovely bathroom. Loved the bath in the bedroom too! Nice touches with bottled water replenished every day and a choc left for you at nightly turndown.
Very clean and cleaning staff were very nice.
Bar staff were good. Also reception staff were good, but didn't give us any details of how to get to the breakfast room, or WiFi code.
The down side... The breakfast. Very poor selection. It's laid out very badly. Nobody to show you where things are. We ordered tea / coffees 4 times and still they never arrived.
The waiting staff couldn't cope and didn't appear to know what to do! We skipped it the next day and ate in a local cafe instead. ",4,2023,03,01
01,Sina Bernini Bristol was REBORN,"In 2021-2022, the coronavirus pandemic caused me to abandon my trip to Italy, but for at least the previous 27 years, I travelled to Italy every year and stayed in different hotels. From my experience, I would like to share my impressions of this stay. Firstly, I was disappointed to see low ratings for Sina Bernini Bristol here and there on TripAdvisor. I would like to state to you all that you should never believe these assessments, as they are past assessments of Sina Bernini Bristol. I would like to stress that Sina Bernini Bristol, a recent addition to the Marriott family, is different from the past. I read on TripAdvisor that the Sina Bernini Bristol is ""not worthy of its 5-star status"", and it is true that there are many aspects of the Sina Bernini Bristol that make it inferior to the 5-star hotels in Milan and Florence. However, all 5-star hotels in Rome are different from 5-star hotels in other countries and regions, and each has its own shortcomings. I would like to say to you, that is the character of the place Rome. For example, I read on TripAdvisor as well as in other Site postings that 'bottled water in the room is not replenished daily'. I also read that 'the breakfast menu is below average for a five-star hotel'. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that happens in hotels in Rome as a matter of course. You may wonder why I am thus tolerant of Sina Bernini Bristol. That's because the staff at this hotel do an excellent job. At least in my opinion, the work of the staff at this hotel is worthy of a five-star hotel. Perhaps you expect the staff of a five-star hotel to be like butlers in an old English aristocratic house, sophisticated yet efficient in their work. Such hotel staff are rarely encountered in Italy, and although I have encountered them several times in the past, I did not feel comfortable with them. The staff working at Sina Bernini Bristol are not like those mentioned above. They are more amicable to guests. For example, every morning when I go to the breakfast room, they talk to me in a friendly way, tell me jokes and take care of me. Also, when I stayed in a five-star hotel in London in the past, the staff at that hotel rarely greeted me, but the staff at the Sina Bernini Bristol all looked or turned to me cautiously when I walked through the entrance hall of the hotel and said, "" Buongiorno!"" and ""Buonasera!"". Everyone there did so to me. On one occasion, a female staff member, sensing that I was heading for the lift, ran from some distance away and pressed the elevator button for me. Of course, even then it was with a greeting. Based on my many years of experience, I believe that hotels in Italy should be rated first and foremost not by their facilities, but by the attitude and appearance of the employees towards the guests. Hotels in the old city centre of Rome are often faulty, even if the internal structure of the building is old and superficially modernised. In fact, during my stay in the hotel, there was a strange smell coming from the pipes in my room and the drain in the washbasin was not flowing properly. But that is Italy. It is Rome. If one admires Italy's history, such problems faced by hotels must surely seem trivial. If you are dissatisfied or have any difficulties, you should immediately discuss them with Sina Bernini Bristol staff at the time. Returning home with a complaint, etc. and later posting a complaint on Site is clearly the wrong course of action, given the nature of Italy. During my stay here, I told the staff that I wanted them to look for something I had left in my room. They did their best to find it for me. Also, when I talked to them about ZTL, which is a scary system for a foreigner like me, they immediately processed it for me. Furthermore, when we told them we wanted a better room they didn't mind one bit and changed it. As such, I feel that the current employees working for Sina Bernini Bristol are professional and in my opinion they should be recognised for this. In these respects, it can be concluded that Sina Bernini Bristol, which is the newest addition to the Marriott Group, can be judged to have been reborn. They no longer cling to history and authority. I would probably choose this hotel again for my next stay.",5,2023,02,23
01,When in Rome…stay at Bernini,"The location is perfect and the rooms are comfortably luxurious but the most impressive feature of the hotel is its staff. Warm, attentive, helpful, professional and solutions-focused, the staff made my business trip in the middle of a January cold-snap, a pleasure! A special mention to Quality Manager, Jessica, who pampered my colleagues and I, ensuring we had everything we needed and more! Grazie e a presto!",5,2023,02,15
01,Good location bad breakfast,"Excellent location, you can walk to almost all historic and famous locations.
In the center of the shopping and restaurants area.
Excellent service.
Professional staff.
Room and bathroom conditions are excellent.
Breakfast is really bad, you feel like stepping into a 1 star hotel. Service and food are very bad at the breakfast area, so I decided not to eat at the hotel.",4,2023,02,05
01,Don’t look for another hotel in Rome - Bernini is the best,"I stayed a week at Bernini on a recent business trip to Rome. From the minute I walked through the door I knew I was somewhere special. The staff were warm, friendly and very helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and modern after a recent refurbishment. The service was altogether exceptional and staff went out of their way to help us through the entire stay - including booking accommodation in other cities, transfers, restaurants, etc - nothing was too much. I have stayed in many hotels in Italy and nothing comes close. The hotel manager Jessica clearly runs a tight ship and is to be commended. She personally greets guests at breakfast or at the bar. I will never need to look for another hotel in Rome. Well done Jessica and Bernini.",5,2023,01,21
01,Top notch service and great location!,"This hotel is amazing, the location, the quality of the rooms and of course the service. 
Sandro took care of my stay from pre check in, to answering request and questions about the stay to providing assistance throughout the stay. They also recognise Titanium elite members very well! Kudos to him and the bellman (Marco).

The view from the rooftop of Rome and the Vatican is so amazing too.",5,2023,01,09

My family had two suites on the 7th floor where we spent December 19-23rd celebrating the Christmas Holiday. This property had a wonderful view of the piazza, an outstanding staff, and had cleanliness as a top priority. We loved the location because it opened up a new area to us in Rome we had never stayed near near before.  
I wouldn’t hesitate to return on our next trip to Rome!",5,2022,12,30

I recommend a bar of soap be provided as an addition to the wall-mounted dispensers, especially in rooms with  bathtub. Will be back soon!",5,2022,12,16

01,Ideal location for exploring Roma,The hotel was perfect. The location was just right for walking around the historical areas of Rome. The rooms were clean and recently remodeled. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was delicious. My wife and I booked through Delta Vacations. Everything went smoothly. I would highly recommend Sina Bernini Bristol.,5,2022,11,26
01,"Great location, but not a 5 star experience","We booked a Signature Superior room (27 sq. m.) recently renovated, for two nights on October 2022. Room number, for reference, was 208. I always try to book recently renovated hotels because that is when a property will be at its best. The Sina Bernini Bristol has been fully renovated on its common areas, with an interesting combination / clash of modern art / style which can be a bit too much. If you are traveling to Rome looking for a classic setting, this might not be the place for you. The room was quite expensive because it was the weekend of the Rome Film Festival: 600 EUR per night. For this, we expected a 5 star experience. I have to say that the room renovation was nice but cosmetic on many aspects: there was no door on the wardrobe, just a curtain, which made it look cheap. There was just one robe in the bathroom, which was perhaps the weakest point of the room (and sadly, the one a guest notices the most, at least speaking for myself). The bathtub was pre-renovation and there were no supporting bars, so getting in and out was tricky. It was clear that the renovation was not in-depth and some finishing details (painting, etc) were not of the highest quality. I would say the renovation is more visible in the common areas than in the particular room we were in. The windows were very good sound-wise, in that they would keep Rome street noises out, except for the garbage truck which felt like a plane was landing, but to be fair that is part of any urban night experience and Rome is no exception. I would say the most disappointing thing outside of the bathroom was the breakfast area and buffet. It was set up in a very grand salon, but tables were too close to one another, and it felt like the last hours of a wedding. The breakfast buffet was poor in terms of quality: dry prosciutto, a very poor cheese selection, freshly cut fruit was scarce and eggs and bacon were just average. Almost no choice of jam which is such an easy thing to cover. A breakfast buffet with warm plates and a nice selection is quite an easy box to tick, but this one was lacking.  Price was 35 EUR if not booked with the room, so I would recommend to have breakfast outside. Service was a bit chaotic and the personnel in charge of replenishing the buffet seemed just bothered to be there. There was one very busy and exhausted, but still helpful waiter, who took on the mission of keeping things together, bless him. I have recently stayed at a hotel in Frankfurt, where the breakfast buffet is much more satisfactory, and it is not a 5 star property. For the price and the luxury experience touted on their website, this was not worth the cost. Location-wise, this is a fantastic choice: near Piazza Spagna, but far enough not to have hordes of visitors beneath your windows at night, and an easy 10-15 minute walk to any tourist spot you want to visit. Also, a convenient light metro stop right in front. So, would I recommend it ? If room prices were around 300-400 EUR, I think it would be a better reflection of what the property has to offer. Location-wise, again, it is great. Best of luck to the hotel and hopefully they can take onboard some of these comments to improve on the breakfast buffet quality.",3,2022,10,23
01,My personal experience,"I have stayed in this hotel three times during my vacation on October 2022, my first stay was for four nights in a superior room and I have raised my below comments to the hotel as follows:
Comparing the price of each night with the quality and the atmosphere of the room it doesn’t seem that this hotel is a 5 stars hotel! The wifi is terrible inhere! Also, and as I know, they should provide each room with complementary water everyday when they do the cleaning but for us we had to ask for that! which in my opinion is not acceptable as I have mentioned before we paid for a high price during our stay! At the end I will not repeat my stay here in this hotel nor recommend it to anyone I know!
What really surprised me is the immediate action taken by the front office manager mr. Marco as he tried his best to solve the issues immediately, on top of that he complimented us with an upgrade during our second and third stay. Overall the location of this hotel is great and if you need to feel the sense of a 5 stars hotel you have to stay in a deluxe room type not a superior. One last thing a very special heartfelt thanks to the most genuine doorman I’ve ever met Mr. Marco (yes everyone there named Marco! I don’t know why) he was so polite and lovely and helped me with great recommendations for restaurants and coffeeshops he really was the highlight of our stay 💖",4,2022,10,22
01,Luxury in Rome,"Beautiful hotel and good location for nearby restaurants. Our room was very comfortable and quiet with good air-conditioning.

01,Beautiful Hotel in the Centre of Rome,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at the Sina Bernini Bristol. This is our third stay at the hotel and we will keep coming back.

The hotel is walking distance to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Vatican, Colloseum, restaurants and cafes and all that your heart desires at your doorstep. The staff are very welcoming and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a rooftop restaurant which has stunning views of the Eternal City. We cannot wait to rebook again in the coming year.

01,"At best, a three star hotel with prices of a four/five star",I had expected so much better for the price of the room. No wi fi during entire stay. General reception  number for hotel was “down” so you couldn’t contact them. Air conditioner had broken fan so all night there was a noise ( hotel fixed finally). Notified house keeping we needed service - told three people but spotty. Ran out of toilet paper at 11pm. No other rolls in room.  Ran out of towels. Requested two twin beds- got king. Breakfast had canned peaches and one fresh fruit. Concierge was good/helpful. Hotel reminds me of a sterile modern cold place. Go somewhere else…,1,2022,10,05
01,Not happy with service,"Expensive for quality of room. Very expensive laundry and no free iron and iron board. 

For the last day they have been drilling for 4 hours from 10am till 1430.its very loud.......

On arrival at the breakfast restaurant when we requested some tea & coffee from one of the waitresses we were answered with a ‘what’. She then continued on clearing tables and made no attempt to bring our beverages. We had to then ask another waitress who was very polite and brought our drinks right away. 
I don’t usually complain but her attitude forced me to write a negative review.
Other than that, the hotel is fab!",4,2022,09,09

Also loved the location. ",5,2022,09,04
01,This is the place to stay!,"We ended up returning to Rome for our flight home a day earlier than originally planned and needed a hotel for one night.   We stayed in Rome at the beginning of our trip and wished we  had stayed at the Sina Bernini Bristol then as well.  We were not unhappy with the hotel we stayed at earlier on, but the Bernini is a step above.  We booked 3 rooms just hours before arriving.  The check in process was all of 5 minutes which deserves a 5 star rating in itself, but our rooms were ready with the extra beds for the children already set up.  This place is the gold standard.  The location is ideal as well. ",5,2022,09,02
01,Best hotel in Rome,"The hotel is absolutely stunning.  Service was excellent and breakfast was perfect. The hotel is perfectly situated so that it is a short walk to high end shopping, unique restaurants, and various attractions. ",5,2022,08,31
01,Perfect In Every Way,"Arrived last week in May / stayed until June 4. Just gorgeous property! From the friendly doorman to the front desk; very professional and courteous. Our room was 5th floor with a balcony and view of the fountain! Worth the price! Awesome accommodations! Clean. Modern. Spacious. The hotel has such atmosphere and has the feel of elegance. The lounge on the main floor was our favorite place to unwind after busy days of touring. Friendly bartender and great drinks. Really loved that we could walk to many sites and if a taxi was needed the doorman was right on it! Would love to return. Great location if you enjoy a good walk - always felt safe. Shopping. Gelato. Great restaurants. And, don’t miss the Palazzo Barberini!",5,2022,08,29
01,Don’t stay here. Hotel not well built,Would not recommend this hotel. The door frame of the connecting room fell off and hit me. They did send maintenance up right away but unsure why this hotel is built like this. Will avoid in the future and would not recommend you and your family stay here,1,2022,08,26
01,Wonderful Stay,"This is a beautiful hotel, exceptional service. Breakfast is a calm, and efficient affair. Staff go out of their way to make you feel valued. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was amazing. Everything in the room was perfect, plenty of space, toiletries in bathroom, liquid soap!! Location is perfect for touring the city with many sites walkable",4,2022,08,20
01,Great Location but…,"The Good: 
Location is perfect.  If you take any of the hop on/hop off tours, one of the stops will be in front of the hotel.   
We failed to use it but there’s a great terrace on top.  
Check in was very easy and front desk was wonderful.  

The Bad:
Housekeeping was horrible.   When we arrived, there was hair in the shower.  One day, towels weren’t exchanged.   Coffee packs weren’t replenish two separate times.  Turn down was in one side of the bed but not the other.  
Sheets were cheap and rough.  
Bed was firm and not comfortable.  
We asked the concierge for recommendations twice.  One time they recommended a restaurant that was just okay.  We later found a hotel across the street from us that was much better.  Another time, we asked for some souvenir stores.   He couldn’t think of any?!?!",3,2022,08,11
01,Wrong all the way,"A very good location for this historic hotel
However hard to get rid of the impression of cheapness. 
The a/c in the room was working but faulty and thus noisy, bed sheets are from the cheapest garment and the room smelt very humid (111). 
Not a very pleasant stay and happy we cut it from 4 to 2 nights. 
The one ask to the concierge was a debacle. We asked for a local trattoria and he sent us to a very touristic place where food was not great. 
Disappointing ALL THE WAY.",1,2022,08,07
01,Pleasant stay--wonderful room,"Our room was a nice size for a city room and included a balcony (no particular view).  Bathroom was a great size, hotel staff was very friendly and the breakfast was delicious.  The concierge booked us dinner reservations one evening and the location was steps from the metro, which was very convenient.  We would stay again!",4,2022,07,30
01,Thumbs Up!,We stayed 5 nights on the front and back end of a cruise.  The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly especially when our hired driver to the cruise ship did not show up as planned.  From soup to nuts this was a perfect spot for me and my daughter.,5,2022,07,20
01,"clean, friendly staff except for one concierge","The hotel is clean and staff are friendly.  Only issue we had was one of the concierges was less than helpful.  We asked him to get a cab, but he insisted that we walk to our tour which he said was straight ahead.  Well it was all uphill, hot as anything and the street split at the top.  We almost missed our tour",4,2022,07,15
01,Nilsa 4 travel,The concierge team and the front desk staff are just AMAZING! They go above & beyond! Truly couldn't do enough for group of 13 that I booked at the hote pre-cruise. Great location and renovated rooms! Thank you for ALL your help! They had a GREAT time!!,5,2022,07,10
01,Rome,"Everything was great ,best hotel in Rome  I was ever staying. Breakfast and view from the restaurant on 8th floor breath taking.Everyone I was in contact with very friendly,patient and professional .Thanks ",5,2022,07,08
01,Cheap hotel with big price tag,"My husband and I stayed here one night after staying in 4 other amazing hotels in Italy and are completely baffled by its 5 star rating. 

The walls are paper thin, we could make out every word of our neighbors conversation, which made it very hard to sleep. 

Our king size bed was actually two twin beds pushed together 

The shower was filthy with hair in the drain

WiFi is dreadfully slow 

I would highly reconsider before booking this hotel.",2,2022,07,08
01,Magnificent and beautiful hotel,"Great and friendly service and beautiful hotel.  We truly enjoyed our stay.  Great breakfast too.
Centrally located to everything and breathtaking views. Great decor throughout hotel.  
Will stay here again.",5,2022,07,05
01,Great improvement,"The last time we stayed here in 2017 I gave this hotel the lowest score I could find, but it has now been greatly improved and is excellent. Both the room décor and food are more than adequate, it is comfortable and all necessities now work as they are supposed to do.",5,2022,06,25
01,Fabulous!,"This hotel was awesome, fabulous staff so helpful and accommodating- nothing was a problem.  Fantastic location, lovely rooms couldn’t fault our stay.  Great Espresso Martini in the bar.  Concierge staff helped us a lot and made life easy for us.",5,2022,06,16
01,Bernini Bristol Palace Roma,"Bernini Bristol Palace Roma is a very nice hotel. Centrally located. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Marco the front desk manager is excellent to work with. We had a very nice time. Grazie to Marco, Maria,Sylvia, & Dante.",5,2022,06,15
01,Awesome location,The hotel is situated in an ideal location for sightseeing.  We were able to walk to many attractions including Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps and so many piazzas.  The staff was attentive and the concierge was able to get us reservations at our top request for dinner.  Rooms are nice considering its city location. The breakfast on the roof was breathtaking. Would definitely stay again.,5,2022,06,13
01,Not worth it,"This is not a 5 star hotel, and heavily overprised. The check in experience was not good. We where promised a room at 2pm, but waited until 3. Breakfast is OK in terms of what is offered, but a complete lack of staff turns it into a nasty and unpleasant experience. No service and quite noisy. Rooms are OK but not fantastic. Location is excellent.",3,2022,05,29
01,Great Rome option! ,"The place looks great. The staff was wonderful.  Breakfast was amazing, so get a package that includes it (unless you're a coffee and piece of toast person). There is some construction going on and we had horrible drilling noises that drowned out our phone call to the front desk. It was taken care of though and it didn't happen again like that. Just more in the distance. Maybe try to get a room away from the back where I think they are integrating new rooms or something. Great location for walking or hitting the tourist bus or Metro. Also had very nice dinner on the roof and the view is great. ",5,2022,05,26
01,Amazing!!!,"My husband and I are delighted. Staff, room, breakfast, cleanliness.. Every single thing and everyone was wonderful! We just came back from a 5 stars hotel in Positano. But there is not comparison with the services and everything else in this hotel. The Bernini Hotel made our trip worth it. Thank you very much. ",5,2022,05,24
01,Lovely trip to Rome,"This hotel is great but lacking some aspects for a 5 star hotel. Firstly on check in the lady exclaimed our stay was a long one (5 days) which we thought was rather rude. The room is set out oddly and did not resemble any of the pictures we had seen previously. However our room was ready early. The coffee in the room was not replenished despite asking 3 times for more. We only got one small complimentary bottle of water on the first day.  In my extensive experience,  most 5 star hotels provide a bottle each day. The room was not cleaned apart from the bathroom and turn down service with a little chocolate was lovely touch...shame they only did it on the first 2 nights and the last night. The rooftop bar was closed as it was raining which was fair enough and the lounge bar was unmanned. We had to ask 3 times on 2 occasions to get someone to serve us. When we complained the concierge just shrugged. The communal toilets were not that clean. However, the breakfast was good and service at breakfast was better. The hotel is situated perfectly with hop on hop off tour buses and taxis right outside and nice walk to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. 
All in all a nice stay in a nice hotel. Would say 4 star with some improvement to make it 5 star.
",3,2022,05,16
01,Perfect for our 1st Rome trip,Nice staff. Eager to help. Breakfast buffet was much bigger and better than expected- loved it. Dinner on the roof restaurant was very nice and waitstaff very nice. Great location to walk to some sights or catch Metro. We took taxis which were always waiting outside. ,5,2022,05,15
01,Brilliant venue for small conferences,"After 2 long years of waiting and postponing dates, we had a fantastic conference at the Sina Bernini Bristol last month with Emanuela helping and supporting our group before arrival and during our stay, thank you for your efforts and your professionalism, much appreciated!
The bright meetings rooms with natural light overlooking Piazza Barberini were beautiful and make a huge difference when you have seminars and meetings throughout the weekend. All staff members looking after us were flexible and helpful, thank you!  
Another special thank you goes to Daniele chef, Simone, Pamela and Fabricio who work in the roof top restaurant (delicious food and brilliant views!) and went out of their way to look after us – what an amazing team!",5,2022,05,09
01,Could definitely do better,"Lots of things to like about this hotel - great location, lovely roof terrace, breakfast service is good and much of it has been refurbished to a high standard during lockdown.

However...

It took me the best part of an hour to check in because the reception staff inexplicably could find no trace of our reservations. This happens but in a so-called five staff hotel, I would expect receptionists to be proactive and helpful. Instead they effectively just shrugged while our booking agent sorted out the problem and I have yet to have an explanation as to where our reservation got lost, despite assurances from a duty manager to follow up.

I was eventually shown to a room in what appeared to be more of a service area rather than the beautiful decorated main corridors. Spartanly furnished and clearly set up for disabled guests, it had handrails in the bathroom and had evidently been serviced in a hurry (very dusty under bed rug) - perhaps a result of the overlooked booking meant we were in 'overflow' rooms. Most important comment I have here is that the lack of an enclosure for the shower in the bathroom made for an exceptionally slippery floor -  very dangerous for able guests, let alone disabled. Bathroom water was cold in this room too, even after an engineer had been called and promised to remedy. Lots of unnecessary noise throughout the hotel too, from staff clanging and clattering around the bars and in corridors overnight.

We were moved to two better rooms on the sixth floor the following day and things improved though the room was never thoroughly cleaned (thick floor dust and glasses etc not replaced). Small things, like two wardrobe door knobs which came off as soon as you touched them, weren't resolved until brought to the attention of staff at least twice.

None of this is a big deal but it felt like we, as guests, were having to do all the work here and in a hotel of this calibre, it shouldn't happen. I'm completely sympathetic to the challenges of recruiting staff in the hospitality industry post-covid but once you have them onboard, train them properly.

I wouldn't normally take to Tripadvisor to rant but despite an emailed survey from the hotel seeking feedback in the first 24 hours of our stay, it felt like the Bernini staff were deaf to any criticism.

Note to manager - when a guest has a less than satisfactory experience checking in, follow up and make sure everything else goes especially smoothly - it'll do wonders for your guest reviews.",3,2022,04,28
01,"Great location, needs some improvements","Awesome location in Rome. We had two rooms. First was equipped with essentials etc but second had not been dusted in quite a while. Glasses , cups missing and opened Nescafé packets not discarded. The second day the dirty towels were removed but not replaced. Do not disturb tag missing. But the rooftop terrace was beautiful and we had breakfast there one morning. Plenty of breakfast options to choose from. Close to metro, Pam market and hop on/off buses. Farmacia on corner.",3,2022,04,28
01,A lot good but room servicing needs addressing,"Beautiful hotel great central position lovely entrance great decor nice roof top restaurant and bar with great views. We stayed three nights lovely bedroom and bathroom I booked rooms with terrace but I would consider them a balcony not a terrace in 401. Problem with hotel and what let’s it down is the servicing of rooms. Both ourselves and our friends had same issues first day bed made two towels left on floor for collection left,  mini bar not replenished dirty tea cups left and not replaced hospitality tray not replaced I requested this to be dealt with on the Tuesday and then twice on the Wednesday before this was done I would expect more from a 5 star hotel. No milk in room you have to call restaurant for this to be supplied.  Basically it appears there is not one chamber person responsible for a room instead appears to be several people doing different tasks and just doesn’t work as no one is then accountable. I was told we had to vacate room at midday at 11.58 am our key stopped working!",3,2022,04,19
01,Great service and location!,We stayed in the newly renovated hotel from April 2-7 and would definitely stay here again. We found the hotel to be very central to all the major sites and walked almost everywhere.  We had two suites which were quite roomy and pristine. Service was excellent...everything from front desk to housekeeping to rooftop bar. The breakfast staff was very friendly and food was excellent. Thank you for making our family vacation such a positive experience!,5,2022,04,07
01,An Enjoyable Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Sena Bernini Bristol back in September 2021, as part of a tour group. We had a fabulous stay. The staff were incredible, friendly and very helpful. On our first morning we decided to try and catch the Pope giving an address at St. Peter’s Square. The clerk at the desk helped us secure transportation. She was unbelievably accommodating. I have been studying Italian for a few months, and have a rudimentary working understanding of the language. I was able to catch the clerk tell our cab driver that we were guests of her hotel, and not to take us on a joy ride through the city for a higher fare. I found it amusing.

The hotel is a bit dated, and we had some issues getting our air conditioning to work properly, but overall the experience at the Sena Bristol was positive. Do not miss the rooftop bar and restaurant. The views are stunning.  And the hotel is centrally located to so many of the treasures of Rome. The famous Trevi Fountain is just a short walk away.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy a late afternoon spritz on the rooftop bar. It’s a can’t miss treat.

Every morning during our stay we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Fruit, meats, salmon, cheeses, breakfast meats and eggs, pastries and breads and the best coffee around. The breakfast alone was worth the price of the stay.

We are planning a return trip in October, and plan at staying at the Sena Bristol. There is a metro station near by if you wish to travel deeper into the city. It’s convenient location is an absolute bonus. But the real joy of staying at the Sena Bristol is interacting with the incredible staff. They are the true representatives of a wonderful hotel experience.",4,2022,04,03
01,"Horrible experience, disgusting staff and not worth a cent .","I have never in my life had to run out of a 5 star hotel before. This one takes the cake !!!

Firstly no concierge to meet you with bag carry.

There is no turn down service.

When arriving the room was not ready as per request however the reception will lie to you saying they have given you upgrade however it's the same room as you paid for. rooms are dated and not what is advertised.
If you have half an hour to get stuck in the old broken elevator with out a alarm but hey who cares if the guest is stuck.

1:30am you'll find yourself surrounded by slamming doors and drunk screaming juveniles . When you lay a complaint you'll be told you are aggressive and the police will be called to arrest me for complaining. Bearing in mind ive had no sleep and been stuck in a lift for half an hour. Door slamming started again at 6:30am.

There's no pool and the restaurant I wouldnt take my dog !! I had to use services stairs as there is no fire escape because I didn't want to get stuck again, we walked through the kitchen. Health and safety need to be called.

Absolutely disgusting and the front of house manager is a complete.. we'll not go there!! There is Zero management skills and this hotel should be re evaluated to zero sarts let alone 5.

STAY AWAY",1,2021,11,27
01,NICE STAY,"Our stay was good as well as staff and service were efficient. Perhaps fornitures have to be renewed within some years. The position is fantastic, in few minutes walking you are in the most beautiful places of Rome.",4,2021,11,18
01,When in Rome stay at the Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel !!!,"Our stays at the Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel was excellent.  The rooms are very good and clean.
The staff were also very good.  
The Head Concierge Massimiliano Errichiello was excellent and a great help, we had lots of questions as it was our first time in Rome.
We will return because the hotel's location, great rooms and to see Massimiliano again.",5,2021,11,17
01,Nice but busy!,"Staff attention excellent, food fantastic, restaurant rightfully one of the best in the country. Our room wasn’t cleaned and serviced fully as there seemed to be a lot of urgency in accommodating a conference and passengers from a cruise ship. We found the previous occupant’s room key, booking details and some receipts on a shelf and the minibar was half empty. From talking to other guests this seems to have been an exception. Service was super, the roof restaurant maitre d’ went out of his way to accommodate and assist us. Would unhesitatingly come again.",4,2021,11,03
01,Great Hotel,"We arrived at the hotel fairly early and we were expecting to have to wait a few hours to get into our room.  We were pleasantly pleased that when we check in Amanda assigned us a room right away.  All the service in the hotel was exceptional.  They were so helpful.  Unfortunately I can’t remember the concierge’ s name, but he was the best.  My husband was having difficulty getting money out of the ATM and this gentlemen literally walked my husband to the ATM across the street from the hotel.  We will definitely stay there again.  ",5,2021,10,27
01,Nice hotel - no 5 star experience,"we had a room booked with a terrace and had to pay extra for it but we had no view at all. so very sorry for the money.
the room had a bath and no shower, So not easy to wash quickly.
Only tea and no coffee at the room, we asked for coffee but then we had to  order it with room service and pay extra.
A lot of noice in the night from other guests and morning from housekeeping (slamming doors)
good bed and good breakfast. friendly concierge.",3,2021,10,20
01,Weekend Getaway,"Love this Hotel... location is Perfect, train from Airport to steps away from hotel about 40-45 min train ride in total... Hotel is walking distance to Restaurants and famous land marks, short walk to everywhere... door man Mario is great, give you honest and good advice... 2nd time at this Hotel never a disappoinment.",5,2021,10,19
01,Great location!,"The hotel is at a perfect location to enjoy Rome especially on a short stay.  It was walkable distance to major attractions such as Spanish steps and all the designer shopping on Via Condotti, Trevi fountain, Piazza Navona etc.  The rooms were spacious with a nice layout and the hallways are like walking in a museum.  The rooftop bar had great views and is a great place to have a cocktail before heading out for dinner.  International pharmacy is in front of the hotel for rapid covid test to return home.  The hotel offers PCR testing in your room if you choose to. 

However the service is lacking - from front desk to doorman to housekeeping to breakfast area. It may be because they are just coming back with limited staff after covid shutdowns but there’s dust in the closets in multiple rooms (we travelled as a girlfriends group and everyone had the same complaint), and no service to speak of at the breakfast area.  Never saw a doorman of a luxury hotel just leave the door and walk away when guests are coming in.   Do they get a lot of unwanted visitors?  The doorman/luggage assistance gentlemen during our checkout early in the morning made up for everyone else as he was very courteous and helpful.  There were mix-ups with city tax charges as some of us were in single rooms and some in doubles, with no apologies - mistakes happen, but how they are addressed matters.  Had to call in 3 times over 2 days for a tea kettle or a coffee maker before finally getting one.  Would we stay here again?  Absolutely, the location and my room overlooking Barberini Palace makes up for everything else.  

Tip:  Take your original passport with you if you plan on designer shopping.  Valentino and Hermès were ok with copies of passports but LV and Gucci required original.  Luckily the hotel is only a 5 euro taxi ride away to come back and get it.  We carried originals throughout the trip but put them in the safe in Rome for fear of pick pocketing.",4,2021,09,29
01,"Great hotel, concierge should be fired","Hotel was wonderful.  Bar / restaurant on roof was fantastic.  View from our room was very nice. 
Concierge yelled at my wife when she was trying to navigate paperwork / language translation issues (COVID return to US requirements) and bullied the front desk people trying to help her.  Hotel also charged us for lodging despite this being a prepay and that I confirmed we were good to go when I checked out.  More than a week later they have not started the refund process.",3,2021,09,29
01,A little less than perfect,"Overall my experience here was good, the lobby is old school lovely, and the corridors are gorgeous. The room is normal Italian size rooms, but the elevators were spacious. Taxies are always outside, and location is great.  Our only compliant was with the staff at the rooftop , and breakfast, a bit too slow, and not really hospitable.",4,2021,09,24
01,Fabulous hotel!,The Sini Brufani Bristol was a real treat.  Our suite was luxurious and easily accommodated two adults and a teenager. Service was excellent.  Be sure to eat in the restaurant; the food is really good and the roof top view is spectacular.  ,5,2021,08,23
01,Roma sempre magnifica ,"Bernini Bristol, a 5* hotel located in Piazza Barberini. We spent 5 days in Rome, the hotel has a great location with a taxi station just in front of the main door. The restaurant at the roof top has a great panoramic view of the Magnificent Rome. Rooms are confortable and clean. The staff is very gentle. Highly recommended 👍",5,2021,08,05
01,Beautiful view from room,"The location near to the most important sites was great. The room, the pillows, beds, towels were all excellent quality.

01,Outstanding hotel with excellent service.,"Superb location. Outstanding front desk staff;.Chiarra and Alexandria went out of their way to be hospitable. and responsive. They also provided great tourist tips

01,"Great hotel, very pleasant staff","Excellent location, very pleasant staff. Renovated rooms are very good and with wonderful view to Piazza Barberini. It was not my first stay there, but it was the very first one after the pandemic, it is evident that they used this period to renovate the whole hotel.
You will enjoy having breakfast or dinner at rooftop restaurant.",5,2021,07,04
01,Our trip to Rom,We had a really extraordinary stay in this best located hotel in one of the excellent suites on the 6th floor with an amazing view allo ver Rom. And enjoyed a really amazing service. Thank you so much. ,5,2020,10,21
01,Disappointed,"When we booked our room, there were no information about restrictions.
Also at the checking-in no one told us about any restrictions.
Restaurant was not working, facilities like sauna, spa, massage were not available 
",2,2020,10,08
01,"Good location, comfortable, pleasant staff","We enjoyed a five night stay in the Bernini Bristol, well located on the Piazza Barberini and thus within walking distance of many of the major tourist sites.  There’s a metro station outside the door and there was always a queue of taxis on the piazza during our stay. 

The hotel is an elegant 20c replacement of the original palazzo.  The  décor is contemporary and tends towards minimalism, a good antidote to the visual overload of Rome’s endless Renaissance art.  Our room (wooden floor) and bathroom (shower over bath) were comfortable, adequately sized and well equipped.   The lighting was particularly good, especially by Italian standards.

Breakfast was an adequate but fairly 'average' buffet with supporting service and good views over the piazza.  We did not use the top floor restaurant.

All the staff we met were friendly and efficient.

WiFI was free and simple to use but rather slow, with occasional outages - it was just about acceptable for tourists but would have been irritating for a business traveller.

Overall, we would rate this hotel as four star plus rather than five star but it met our needs and we consider it a good base.",4,2020,03,07
01,Exceeded Expectations,"This property was suggested to us while I was contemplating where to stay in Rome by a friend who is a travel professional. I was considering a few ‘big name’ luxury hotels and was not familiar with this property. May I state emphatically how glad I am that we took the advice of my friend?! Everything was honestly as close to perfect as one could expect. From the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out four days later, the staff, the service, the room - just exquisite. I’ve been so many places that had one or the other - either great people but lacking amenities, or a fantastic hotel with so-so staff. And did I mention how convenient and central we were to everything and how spectacular the views were from the rooftop bar? We will definitely plan to stay here in the future. Thank you Bernini Bristol!",5,2020,02,21
01,"Fantastic location, lovely hotel","Within touching distance of the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps, this hotel couldn’t be better located for a trip to Rome. You can even walk to the Vatican in around 30 minutes. Lovely room, clean and spacious. Friendly and helpful staff. Would stay again. 

Top tip: visit the roof top for a coffee, sun and a great view of Rome ",4,2020,02,17
01,Short break,"Hotel was lovely and welcome was very nice. Mario at the door was so helpful. 

However the room next to us was so noises we couldn’t sleep. The sound proofing between rooms is next to nothing. That was very disappointing

01,Beautiful hotel,Everything about this hotel was gorgeous . The staff were nice food in hotel and room service was definitely up to par . There is zero parking how ever a staff member offered to keep my rental car out front during my stay and keep an eye on it . When we can back one night someone had hit the side of the car . Luckily I had extra insurance or I wouldn’t give a five star rating for this place,5,2020,01,11

01,Terrible Hospitality from a 5 Star Hotel,"My wife and I, (along with our family of 6 others), booked 4 rooms at the hotel for 7 nights. During the entire stay, the lack of general hospitality was appalling . From being unable to get a hold of reception or room service for hours on end due to hotel staff not answering the call, to waiting hours for simple requests such as complimentary bottled water and ice. The entire experience has been nowhere near the level of service one may expect of a 5 star hotel. Despite the beautiful interior and locality of the establishment, the overall lacklustre approach of the hotel staff, as well as the cleaning staff in prepping the rooms or doing a turn down (or lack there of) service was simply not to the level of the price paid. We certainly will not be coming back, and would not recommend the Sina Bernini Bristol as a choice of stay in the future.",1,2019,12,28
01,Great service and top notch location,Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms very nice and newly renovated with great views . Can’t beat location- close to just about everything.

01,All We Could Hope For,"Our first trip to Rome, and the accommodations were great - clean and comfortable.  But it was the staff that made us feel at home for 4 days.  From the helpful concierge to the desk staff, we trusted their advice and they listened to our stories.  We go back to Rome, we go back to the Bernini.",5,2019,11,27
01,Service below standard,"If you plan to stay in this hotel, don't count on them giving you a wake-up call. Make sure you use the alarm on your cell phone. My tour operator booked this hotel when I was traveling to Rome this past October, and they failed to give me a wake-up call twice, while I stayed there.",3,2019,11,24
01,THE WORST HOTEL ,"Our visiting to your hotel was a very very bad idea .. really we didn’t feel comfortable at all, and i will explain why:

- we booked from agaency one room (superior room) and when we trying to check where is the option to choose a king bed because we re a couples we did not find, so we send them e-mail and they approve it , when we arrive their they told us ( so you didn’t mention that you need a king bed so that we are sorry we’ll give you twins bed, my husband tell them that no we hava send an e-mail to you .. dircltly she said yes ok ) 

- They give us as they said (supreior room) but it wasn’t the room we saw on booking .. its was so classic but our problem not because its classic .. because its very old .. all the drawers are broken .. its very dark .. we told them that we book your hotel because we saw modern room .. they told us no u book superior room and this is a supreior room, we try to talk to them they told us what we can do to transfer you tomorrow to another room (modern room) / but after too much talking not directly 

- There saftey box is not saftey box at all, when you put (00000000) its opened !! 

- staff is very very nervious, not friendly, un helpful at alllllllll !!!!! They don’t talk to you in a good way really ( you feel like you are not in a 5 stars hotel ) really really we did not saw any of them with smiling or welcoming, i travelled many placed .. especially in italy the staff is vey friendly, smiling to you .. when you enter the hotel they say to you ( hi / welcome / good morning .. any welcoming words ) but these staff of reception nothing at all / when you enter the hotel they just keep looking at you with not welcoming face

- Even the concerge they did not talk to you in a good way, we was asking for the train stations .. they dont give you a good help / he talk to us while he’s doing somthing in files not with full respect 

- Locations is very good

- Rooms are not cleaned well at all, it 

- was so dusty when we take it 

- Bed is the worset bed in my life, i had a back pain from it. 

- Bad smell of towels + bed sheets 

- Room service does not clean the room well when u call them, i mean when we put a sign to make the room they just make the bathroom + bed sheets / because we are drinking sometimes a water or coffee so there is a dirty galsses / they don’t take them next day .. they leave them

- there is no coffee machine 

- There is no ketle for water (we asked and they bring / but my point is 5 stars hotel must be everything is availble ) 

- fridge is very hard to open 

Really really it was a very bad stay, will not suggest this hotel to any body

01,Lovely and wonderful Rome location,It was our first time in Rome and what a lovely hotel  that was close to everything ! The staff was friendly and accommodations top notch! Would definitely stay there again and recommend to all my friends!,5,2019,10,22
01,Best location,"Right in heart of Rome, with a top view, very stylish and raffinate.  Not 100% clean and staff not efficient as they should be. For the price you expect top service but they are a bit snobby and careless. There’s isn’t a toilet paper holder",3,2019,10,21
01,"I am torn...some bad, some very bad","I really wanted to like this hotel. However there were some serious issues. We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of the trip and two nights at the end  of the trip 14 days later. 
One observation that I would make right from the beginning is that there is a HUGE communication problem inside this hotel. 
First, there were several groups of tourists staying here that needed to be on a bus by 9am. Opening breakfast at 8am makes it a real challenge and having to feed 30, 40, 50 people right off the top when nothing is ready makes for a hard start to the day for everybody. Why would they not coordinate this better?
The rooms for our first two nights were good, very modern, clean and well kept. The service for the first two nights was ok. One hiccup, we needed a taxi or car service at 6am for an early morning tour of the Vatican and no one had arranged it. Luckily we had planned for disaster and they were able to get us a taxi. It was later than we wanted, but we arrived in time. 
The service for the last two nights of the trip was horrible. My friend had returned to Rome without me and they had lost her reservation - even though I confirmed it before we left the first time. Luckily they had a room. When I arrived 2 days later, I had a beautiful suite on the top floor with a fabulous view - serious bonus! But, they left a piece of luggage in my car and by the time it was over, it took almost 4 hours to get it to me. The guy at the front desk was argumentative and frankly very rude about it and more or less told me it was my fault and I should be grateful that they were, ""willing to make an extra trip due to my poor planning"" wow - that is some interesting perspective. While I was taking a shower I was walked in on by housekeeping - despite my key card being in the slot indicating I was in the room. The concierge staff was not helpful. My friend had asked for them to make dinner reservations for us that evening and they said they would. When we inquired about those reservations later in the day, the same concierge abruptly pointed out that the restaurant that he had suggested was closed...ok, maybe try something else? This seemed like a foreign concept to him. The hotel is very nice, in a great location and is probably pretty good, they just need a little polish. I might try it again.",3,2019,10,20
01,Family trip,"Nice hotel, this is my second visit. I have been very disappointed this visit. Apparently the hotel books non stop large groups that takeover every amenity available. The rooftop restaurant they advertise was closed to guests most nights during our visit.  So beware. Additionally, the hotel lobby is not big enough to support the horde of convention goers they let in. Individual guests lose out. It was always a madhouse.",3,2019,10,19
01,Roman hospitality at its best!,Our room overlooked the piazza and  was newly renovated and beautiful. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and were helpful in finding restaurants and other attractions. The rooftop bar has spectacular views of  the city that is a must see. Staying here was a big reason why we fell in love with Rome. ,5,2019,10,16
01,good stay,"The hotel changed our room immediately when we realised it would not suit my husband's mobility needs, the room we were given was a comfortable room as well as being quiet, Overall it was a nice stay. Breakfast was OK but if we were there at about 9.00 the food was not hot, bacon was so hard it could not be eaten and some items were not available at all, earlier in the morning was better",4,2019,10,15
01,Value for money in great location,"I have stayed in many hotels in Rome and have found this hotel the best. The location is fantastic adjacent to metro line and close to major attractions. The price compared to many hotels in same category is great value. The hotel has recently renovated most rooms that are modern, spacious and offer amazing views of the Piazza in front. Breakfast is a little simple compared to some hotels however having breakfast on the roof terrace is a must and worth the visit even just for a coffee.",4,2019,10,13
01,Beautiful hotel,"This a great place or at least it will be once the addition is connected to the main hotel.  We checked in and were taken to the new annex.  Unfortunately, we had to walk outside and work to unlock a hundred year old door and lock.  We then entered another lobby and took the elevator to the fourth floor.  Another problem was that in order to go back to lobby, we had to walk down to the third floor to get the elevator.  This meant that when we checked out, we had to drag our suitcases down the stairs.",4,2019,10,09
01,Great hotel in a superb location,"We were only here overnight but it is a perfect location for Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain etc.  Some of the rooms have already been refurbished but even the older rooms are still ok.
We ate in the rooftop restaurant which was really good and it has a lovely bar up there - fantastic views.
There are loads of restaurants and bar close by too if you want to venture out and soak up the atmosphere,",5,2019,10,09
01,Good hotel and good location. ,"We spent four nights here and enjoyed the hotel. It has a great location - easy walking distance to Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. Great restaurants close by, some just around the corner. Grocery store across the street. Subway stop across the street. “Hop on - hop off” bus stop is across the street. 

If you need reservations for tours or restaurants, Max at the concierge desk was great. He got everything we wanted for us. 

The room was very clean and very comfortable. ",4,2019,10,07
01,accommodation,"no doubt the location strategic and well connected with places of attraction. Located on top hilly area and aerial view of Rome landscapes really amaze. Yet it not match with the quality of the room, room decoration and not reach my expectation referring to her standard. Need to improve on the practicality of the room especially on interior walkout and design, especially on bed quality. Anyways superb and warmly staff especially Marco at concierge. ",3,2019,10,05
01,Bernini Bristols,"Perfect location for many different activities. Quick ride to Travis Fountain, St Paul’s inside the walls. Great shopping area. Great restaurants. Can’t say enough about the friendly staff we had a wonderful stay in beautiful Rome. ",5,2019,10,05
01,Rome trip,We loved our stay. The hotel was first class and the staff was outstanding. We would definitely come back. The location was within walking distance of attractive sites and fine dining. All this was important to us.,5,2019,10,04
01,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff","We stayed in a suite overlooking the Bernini Fountain.  The staff was great, sincerely checking that we were comfortable.  It is a beautiful hotel with a gracious and knowledgeable staff.   The location is superb and there are many superb and quaint shops and restaurants within a block.",5,2019,10,04
01,Excellent hotel in Rome.,"We had a fantastic experience staying here for four nights. The friendly and helpful staff, delicious breakfast buffet, and beautifully renovated room made our stay quite comfortable.  The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to nearly everything.  Taxi service is available right in front of the hotel.  ",5,2019,10,03
01,Central location and beautiful hotel ,"My husband and I stayed at the Sina Bernini Bristol last week and it was lovely. We had no idea just how central they are to so many tourist attractions such as the Trevi fountain, the Spanish steps, or the Villa Borghese.  There was a lot of history associated to the hotel which also made it very interesting. 
We we did the breakfast combo which was perfect to have an exceptional breakfast before going out for the day. For the first mornings of our stay we were able to have breakfast on the rooftop before they unfortunately moved it to a lower floor. However the food was delicious there was a bread table, pastries, eggs, meats, cheeses, seasonal fruit plenty of options.

Our room was lovely and given that you’re in the city is a decent size. The bathroom was spacious with a shower and separate tub, there was also plenty of toiletries and a hairdryer! We had turn down service every evening.
The staff were nothing but friendly and helpful to us. Even when I  wasn’t able to communicate very well in Italian. 
I would say it was only slightly disappointed with the rooftop bar. It never exactly seemed open and was told twice during our stay it was closed for private events without much notice.  There was a bar in the lobby but we had hoped for the views. We never got a chance to enjoy the restaurant but you can tell it is the focus of the rooftop. 
Overall I would certainly recommend staying here or coming back for another visit!",5,2019,10,01
01,People of Color Beware!,"I am fair skinned, my wife is dark complexioned.  I noticed right away the difference in treatment when we went up to the front desk they conversed with me and did not talk to my wife.  Another thing is our refrigerator didn't work.  We called and they came several times but never fixed the refrigerator or replace it. When we went to breakfast the next day we were stopped by the hostess who asked our room number and checked our names while the people who were not of color just walked right in to be seated.
On the positive side the room was very clean and had an awesome view. 

We pay the same money as the other guests and we expect to be treated just as well.  Since we were not then we will not be staying there again.",1,2019,09,28
01,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the restaurant.bistro offers great food and service.  The terrace bar provided a wonderful view of the Rome skyline.  Unfortunately, the female bartender was rude and provided extremely poor service on each of the four occasions we were serviced by her.  She never offered a wine list or snacks,  Our experience with other servers was the exact opposite every time - exceptional.  The morning breakfast was delicious and offered great variety for any nationality.  ",3,2019,09,28
01,People of color do not stay here,"The hotel management instead of apologizing for my experience they were aggressive In response which further validated my review. While traveling cities they requested my review be removed so here it is again! 

The hotel is beautiful with great views. However, if you are a person of color I would suggest you try another hotel. We were never served at the resturant it was apparent that people of color were not welcomed. Imagine walking into the resturant and the Caucasian in front of you was greeted, seated and served coffee. And you were asked what room are you in (which was not asked to the person in front of you) and then seat and serving your self. I had to find coffee cups and refresh our own coffee as everyone around you received first class service. Imagine the rolling of the eyes and nasty looks while trying to enjoy your breakfast like everyone else. Pamela was one name I could remember that was the host that clearly took my skin color in offense. Imagine the front desk telling you there are no irons but you walk out of your hotel room and see the bellhop personally delivering a iron and ironing board to the room across from you. 
It was almost as if the staff was shocked that we could afford to stay there and we didn’t belong. There is racism everywhere but I have never personally been a victim until now. I would never return to this Bristol which is unfortunate because the views were amazing but the service was less then par. However, if you are not a person of color you will receive phenomenal service and etiquette so there’s that. 
We tried to order a cafe’ from the rooftop restaurant and the waiter was extremely dismissive as she told us to sit somewhere and wait. We waited as instructed but when we noticed her serving other guest and took the time to check her phone and communicate casually with other staff it was obvious that we were never going to receive and pay for our cafe’ whenever she felt like making it. We took that as the last straw and returned to our room to go out and order cafe’. 
SO AGAIN IF YOUR A PERSON OF COLOR TRY ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.",1,2019,09,27
01,"Good location, excellent staff , room in need of updating.","We arrived at the Sina Bernini Bristol and were happy with the location in Rome. The Concierge and staff were very accommodating and helpful during our 2 night stay.  This is a 5 star hotel and we had a suite. The room was clean but in need of updating. The furniture is older which I was actually surprised about. Aside from that, our stay was pleasant and it was a good experience.",3,2019,09,26
01,Great stay and great meal,"My husband and I stayed here in a deluxe king room, the room was rather large, nice bathroom too. The hotel is very nice, great location, and good price for a nice hotel in Rome. The restaurant here is amazing! The view is awesome and the food was incredible. We had amazing service too. Thank you for a great stay, we will be back again",5,2019,09,21
01,Excellent hotel,We stayed three nights and extremely clean rooms and staff very accommodating. We really enjoyed eating breakfast buffet each morning on the rooftop! Rooftop bar was also nice at night for drinks. Would definitely stay in this hotel again!,5,2019,09,20
01,Solid Hotel,Great concierge.  Great rooftop deck.  Rooms are ok but AC is really weak...just as every review notes.  Neighborhood is also great with fun small spots nearby.  Service and Concierge were superb and just let the folk at the front desk guide you -- they will not steer you wrong.,4,2019,09,18
01,NO,"They tried to charge my card multiple times saying I confirmed a reservation. I didn’t really think I’d have a problem when I reached out and would have preferred to resolve it with the hotel staff, but I was told no and also 3 days after that they tried to charge my card again. My credit card company shut that down thankfully. I’m honestly shocked that a hotel claiming to be of this caliber has staff so poorly skilled in relating.",1,2019,09,18
01,Perfect location and wonderful staff!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sini Bernini Bristol last year and were excited to return again this month to celebrate his birthday. Maria upgraded us to a spacious room with huge balcony and spectacular views of the city and the staff were very  welcoming. In fact we walked into our room and had a bottle of champagne waiting for us to welcome us back to Rome and their lovely hotel. Sini Bernini Bristol is in a perfect location and easy walk to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Colloseum, Vittoriano to name a few must see locations. We will definitely be back again on our next visit to Rome!",5,2019,09,17
01,Not a 5 star quality,"Although it claims to be a 5 star hotel it is far from it
I stayed in a suite and the room was old and dark. The little refrigerator was hard to open because it was put in an le armoire and the door kept the refrigerator door stuck.  We had 5 hangers in the closet. I requested more and never got them, after a few days and asking more than once I got two more hangers. The reception personal was unfriendly and impatient.  Not accommodating or pleasant to talk to. It was like if it was an aggravation to answer a question or give a recommendation.
I was very unhappy with the hotel in general. Good location  but I am sure Rome has many better options to stay.
The rooftop restaurant was highly recommended to us and I have to say our experience was as bad as the hotel.  Very slow service, unfriendly and not exceptional.  Food was ok... but not Michelin restaurant quality.",1,2019,09,15
01,Uninspiring,"The location and view from the restaurant are fantastic but the dinner was unimaginative, uninteresting and the pasta was not al dente - it needed one more minute. It was undercooked. A cauliflower casserole my husband ordered was expensive and tasted like rotten vegetables. The dessert menu was pathetic - no choices and what we did order tasted commercial not chef prepared.",3,2019,09,13
01,Gorgeous views,"Gorgeous views accommodating staff. Love the location we walked to all the sites but it’s still in a cute little neighborhood. Very clean rooms, the beds were awesome for a sensitive lower back. Smelled great!
All American tourists though. ",5,2019,09,12
01,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"The rooms were nice, clean and we'll kept. The hotel was ideally located for walking to most of the locations I wanted to visit on this trip. For further locations taxis were always on site and the double decker tourist bus was at the corner.",5,2019,09,12
01,Great place and location. Unforgettable.,"Very comfortable room, the bed very cozy, everything clean.
 I suggest to keep a better maintenance of the WC and the coffee maker. Everything else was perfect.
We spend an amazing time there. Great service. We will come back. I Totally recommended.  ",5,2019,09,04
01,Average Hotel,"Hotel did not live up to the 5 star rating. The rooms were average, the fan rattled and the room was very noisy. We could hear the person sneezing in the room next to us as well as his music playing. Definitely the loudest hotel we have ever stayed in. Maid service did not replenish our tea or coffee cups either. With all the options in Rome, next time we will look elsewhere for a hotel. ",3,2019,09,02
01,Very Good Hotel in Great Location,"Right in the middle of Rome and next to a Metro station, it'd be hard to find a hotel in a better location for exploring this wonderful city. The hotel staff are pleasant and helpful and the breakfast buffet probably the best we've had anywhere. Our room certainly wasn't 5-star though - more like a 3.5-star but it was very clean and, let's face it, how much time do you spend in the room anyway?

We did visit the roof top bar but service was very slow and the drinks expensive, so we just had one each. Even then, it took ages to get the bill. However, there are plenty of good bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity (don't forget to explore the side streets where true dining bargains can be found) so, again, not really an issue.

Overall, we'd certainly recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay there again.",4,2019,08,29
01,Good Hotel near all major attractions,The Metro stop is less than 100 steps from the hotel making trips to the sites easy. The hotel staff were top notch - anything you needed the took care of it right away. There are plenty of restaurants near by as well as many stores for the shoppers. We only had breakfast while we were there. The buffet was very good with lots of choices and the table service was excellent. Our room was very clean but a bit small considering the price. Would stay there again on a future trip to Rome.,4,2019,08,27
01,Rome vacation,"The hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. From the concierge staff to the restaurant staff all made us feel welcome and safe. Breakfast was exceptional. The quality of the food, the awesome views and the most welcoming and attentive waiters started our day happily. Thanks to your great staff for giving us such a pleasant experience. Great hotel!",5,2019,08,20
01,Great hotel for any Rome visit,"Great hotel situated in a bustling area of Rome. We arrived early in the morning after our long international flight and once at the hotel, the staff was warm and friendly - something you kinda need after a flight and the hectic getting out of the airport. Despite being ahead of checkin they did take our bags for us and we quickly found a coffee shop easy walking distance. After a bit of time they did give us a “miracle” and we got into our room ahead of schedule. 

The room we had was Signature Deluxe. This room was a “modern room” with ample power outlets using Type C so the fear of Italy being different from other parts of Europe wasn’t realized. The bed was great and me being 6 feet 5 I had no issues with my feet being off the bed. The shower was wonderful and no problems being tall, just get used to no shower curtain like in the US.  Also understand that your access card operates all the power outlets in your room. Welcome to Europe!

The hotel also has a nice roof top restaurant and bar with good food, friendly wait staff and great views of Rome any time of day, especially at night and you can be outside with the stars enjoying a nice drink with your wife.  Be sure to have their breakfast same location in the mornings!

Speaking of friendly, I cannot think of a single time we left or came back to the hotel where we were not greeted by someone.  This level of friendly interaction extends also to the rooftop restaurant, where we got to know in a short time a few of the wait staff - we found them to be incredibly gracious.  Rome is a special place, this was shown in the hotel too as you may find Italy has some of the most friendly people in Europe (at least in our experience).

The hotel is near many things walking distance. Sadly the nearest subway tunnel was closed when we were there, but you can still walk to a close by station in about 15 or so minutes. There is a taxi station right outside the hotel so you could use that to get anywhere you need to go that is not an easy walking distance. There’s also a bus stop. 

Bernini is a great hotel and we will stay here again next time we visit Rome. I think you’ll love this hotel too.

Good luck!",5,2019,08,20
01,Will not recommend or return to the Bernini Bristol,"Context: we have stayed in many luxury hotels in Europe including Italy.

The Sina hotel Bernini Bristol did not live up to expectations in many ways and in no way matches its much nicer Sina Viareggio, where staff are fantastic. The Rose Garden palace in Rome is far superior. 

Cons: the table staff at the rooftop restaurant where breakfast and lunch were served clearly were not interested in providing any service to hotel guests. They did not set up breakfast tables on the outside deck and guests had to clean off tables, and look for their own cutlery and napkins. Staff never came outside to actually ask customers if they wanted hot beverages at any time. Instead, guests have to leave their tables and return inside the restaurant to flag down a table staff member to order drinks, like we were asking a favor of them. Meanwhile several staff spent all their time standing around talking to each other instead of actually working. Staff were disinterested in guests as they entered and left never once bothering to say good morning or good bye in Italian. As my son remarked during our lunch there on day, “the workers seem bothered that guests come and interrupt their “getting paid for not doing any work time.” 

The hotel fitness room was the most dirty and unpleasant one I have seen anywhere. It smelled of cigarette smoke the moment you enter the spa fitness area. We suspected a staff member was taking a smoking break inside a nearby room. The staff working there asked me to tidy up and return any used equipment to its place even before I used the equipment. She said the room is for other guests to enjoy even though I was the only one there. Guests who stay at luxury hotels already know how to treat equipment there is no need for a staff member to tell guests in advance to put things away in advance. The equipment is very old and dirty. There are not many machines to use. i have included photos. Turndown service is expected to remove wet towels from bathroom floors but this did not happen. The bathroom is poorly designed with no hooks for bathtowels, clothing or robes and the space is very small. 

Pros: view of Rome from rooftop is amazing. Location is fantastic.",2,2019,08,14
01,Perfect stay for our anniversary!,"Our first visit to Rome was perfect.  The extraordinary care given to us by Chiara, Chiara (yes there are 2), Alessandra, Alvin and Sandro definitely made our stay perfect.  Thank you Alvin for making us reservations at Gallura on our anniversary day and informing them of our special day.  The surprise singing and candles by the servers was amazing.  Sandro you saved the day with booking out visit to Vatican City and making sure we had what we needed to continue our trip to Florence.  Thanks to Fabioso for getting us our fried eggs!  Views of the city from the Bernini rooftop is like no other.  The Bernini is a beautiful hotel and our room was comfortable, clean and the modern.  The wine, champagne and fruits added that special touch.  The location is perfect! We can't wait to plan our next visit and will certainly stay at the Bernini.  Lastly to the owner of the Bernini, thank you for having an amazing staff who obviously care about the guest and work hard to ensure the guest receive the best experience ever! You can be proud of your team!!",5,2019,08,07
01,Great position-hotel lacking,"The Bernini Bristol is in a great position for a visit to Rome , we stayed in 2014 and rebooked because of the position 

The hotel has had some refurbishment but i think is relying too much on its past history too attract visitors , the refurb is to an ordinary standard , the room we stayed in had the entrance hallway painted black which had the effect of making a small room smaller . The hotel also experienced lift problems during our visit , hot water was a 5 to 10 minute running water wait (hardly environmentally sustainable)

The roof top breakfast was ordinary , with the hot part cold - cold eggs ,bacon and sausage are not enjoyable 
All in all the hotel is not value for money

",3,2019,08,03
01,Location Location,"Location Location!!! But also a great hotel. Comfortable, clean, nice, great staff. A special mention to Roberta and Alvin at the reception who gave us great advice.

Two constructive comments: you need better arrangement to serve eggs at breakfast. Not great.",5,2019,07,29
01,Absolutely Amazing for Anniversary,"We booked this hotel for our 1st Anniversary and it was awesome. It’s in the most ideal location. It’s in walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, That’s Amoré(best restaurant in town), Palazzo of Leonardo, and all the best shopping. You can’t beat the amazing breakfast they serve on the rooftop and this place has an amazing staff. For our Anniversary we wanted to schedule a cooking class, and the Concierge Sandro called the best place in town(That’s Amore) and scheduled our a class on the spot. All of their recommendations were spot on. Don’t miss their rooftop view and restaurant. We loved Pamela! She’s just the best. They were sublime for our week stay. You’ll be missing out if you don’t book.",5,2019,07,28
01,The rooftop is great but...,"Let me start by saying that everyone we encountered at this hotel was accommodating and nice. I have no complaints about the staff at the hotel or the restaurant. I originally selected this hotel because of the view the rooftop provides and it did not disappoint. The restaurant and lounge are beautiful and provide the best views of Rome. You do need to know that Sina might have been a 5 star hotel at one point but it is no longer. As long as your expectations are adjusted I think you will be satisfied with your stay. The reception area is not only dated (which could be charming) but it also looks a little beat up and has an unpleasant odor. Some of the rooms which they called “classic” have not been renovated and I found it dark, dated and with a lumpy mattress. A 3 star accommodation not 5. We were transferred to a renovated room which was pleasant, but again not what I would expect at a 5 star hotel. The shower flooded the whole bathroom so we tried using the tub instead and then the hose came off the wall spraying water everywhere. I was left cleaning my self with a damp towel in the sink. 
Expect noise because the hotel is located in a busy plaza. The metro entries were closed when we stayed so we experienced less noise but be prepared to bring earplugs. I will say this can also be seen as a good feature when the metro is open for accessibility. 
Would I stay at Sina again ? Maybe... the staff was kind and the view can’t be beat. They also don’t charge 5 star hotel prices for their rooms, so just know what you are getting for your buck and adjust expectations.",3,2019,07,21
01,Perfect Location,"It’s always such a pleasure staying at the Bernini Bristol in Roma. When you arrive, you have a wonderful welcome from the concierge and reception team and it doesn’t just end there. The rooms are lovely and clean too and their location is perfect because it’s centrally located within walking distance of all the wonderful attractions Rome has to offer. ",5,2019,07,21
01,Over the top hotel and staff!,"My husband and I traveled with our son and his girlfriend to Rome and had the most wonderful experience at the Bernini Bristol Hotel. Our family of four made the mistake of booking at another hotel which quickly became a nightmare of a stay. On our second night in Rome, my husband arranged for us to move to the Bernini Bristol Hotel. What a difference!!! It was beautiful, like from a movie. The staff were incredible! Dante, Sandro, Gabriel, Roberta, Claudia, Fabio, Vineto and Aly from the roof top bar all provided excellent tips on restaurants, tours and shopping venues close to the hotel. Our suite was a very spacious, clean and beautiful. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. The bathroom was very spacious and bright. Loved our stay at this wonderful hotel and we definitely be back! Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to many delicious restaurants and wants to be treated like royalty from its wonderful staff. Thank you for making our trip of a lifetime memorable in a great way! See you soon!",5,2019,07,10
01,Italy trip,This is a wonderfully beautiful hotel in the Bernini square in Rome. Centrally located and easy to access. The staff is  A+ and extremely accommodating. 5* service and such beautiful decor. Has nice bar and the restaurant has excellent food. ,5,2019,07,07
01,3 star not 5,"Service is poor and arrogant. Breakfast is hit and miss, no orange juice !! The restaurant is over priced and the service non existent. Very very disappointing. Many better hotels in Rome, beware!!
This is not a 5 star hotel.",3,2019,07,07
01,Great location in Rome,This hotel is centrally based in Rome very close to Fontana Di Trevi and Spanish steps. Other Rome attractions are also walking distance. The hotel has an old Italian charm. Rooms are very clean some with a view to the Bernini fountain. Buffet breakfast was above expectations and the roof top restaurant and bar are freakin awesome with uninterrupted views of the Vatican and surrounds. Staff very friendly. I would definitely stay here again,4,2019,06,30
01,Awful Restaurant,"We visited the rooftop restaurant at Bernini Bristol at the end of May to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We had a lovely wedding reception there and thought it would be a lovely idea to take our children and close family there 10 years on. The views from the rooftop are incredible. However the service and quality of food was terrible. The children were served breaded cutlets and chips which looked like they had appeared from the depths of the freezer. The cutlets were so thin, they were barely visible. We complained to the staff at the end of the evening as the children’s food was inedible and they agreed to remove the price of a bottle of house wine (40 Euros ) from the bill. We later discovered that the bottle of wine had a retail value of 5 Euros! I know there’s a mark up of wine in restaurants, but that is scandalous. BEWARE. Would you expect a 5 star, luxurious hotel restaurant to serve a 5 Euro bottle of wine and charge 40 Euros? I sent an email to the hotel restaurant 3 weeks ago and have not even had an acknowledgement of my email never mind an explanation. So disappointing. Needless to say, we will never visit the hotel again, which is a shame because we have such lovely memories from our wedding reception. By the way this is the first complaint I have ever posted on trip advisor as I am not usually one to complain.",1,2019,06,26
01,Great hotel ,"Centrally located. The minute we walked in we felt we were in a classic hotel. Very pretty. The room was spacious, very modern, clean and stylish. But even better than the room was the staff! Everyone was very helpful and did their best to make our stay memorable!!",5,2019,06,21
01,Warm Welcome!,"We stayed here the last couple nights of our Honeymoon, Our room was BEAUTIFUL and very spacious. The bed was very comfortable! We loved it. About 5 min of us getting into the room and comfortable, one of the staff (a young blond lady) welcomes us, brought us a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit! She also insisted if there was anything they could do to make our stay better to let her know, when we came down to do some exploring the concierge was so sweet and took so much time with us explaining the city and places to eat. Took time with the map and even toured us the rooftop (which had a gorgeous view) Then the GM came and met us. My Husband and I are both in Hospitality so are very very pleased when we come across such amazing hospitality and warmth. The GM was so very nice and gave us his card in case we needed anything further. Our stay was amazing and will definitely stay here again when we come back to Rome!",5,2019,06,21
01,Terrible experience,"I find it strange that this can even be considered a 5 star hotel. We just checked out and I couldn’t even wait to get home to write this review. At first the hotel seemed nice. Good lobby and room. Upon further glance in the room however, we start hearing a lot of bird noise. Annoying, but not the end of the world. Once we got up to investigate, we notice a hole near the window and actual bird POOP on the floor and wall near the hole (room 608). The bed was beyond uncomfortable and felt like sleeping on a rock. We might as well been outside sleeping with the homeless with the bird poop on the ground around us. They were able to change our room and I appreciate that, however the fact that they would even put a paying guest on their honeymoon in such a disgusting environment it is hard for me to get past. Once they changed our room, to an “upgraded room”, the bed was still extremely uncomfortable and even smaller then the previous room and the walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors hacking loogies, taking showers, arguing with each other, and doors slamming all night long from the hallways. To make matters even worse, upon checkout we were charged for something we did not do even though I asked for clarification from the man when he told us our payment. We were charged for “frigo bar” for room 117 when we were in fact not in that room and no where near that room. So instead of compensating us in any way for putting us in a poop infested room to begin with, they charge us even more for something we did not do. I’m disappointed we even spent a dime at this place. It is a 2 star hotel at best covered up in “5 star” decor. I would highly suggest finding a better “5-star hotel” that actually holds true to that title. ",1,2019,06,20
01,Great location and staff is great.,We enjoyed our visit. Cool rooftop restaurant where breakfast was included and the views were great. Spotty Wifi but other than that we would highly recommend the hotel and the staff was exceptional. A bit larger than normal European rooms.,4,2019,06,14
01,"Good location, lovely public spaces too!","This hotel is located in the heart of the historic district. The views from the rooftop restaurant and lounge are fantastic! We were upgraded from a standard room, but our room wasn't very big. There was scaffolding outside our window and we had to keep it closed so the workers couldn't see in. We were told that our room was newly renovated, but there was dust all over the mini bar area and housekeeping was inconsistent - towels, no towels, etc. The spa area was nice especially since most hotels in Europe skip this. The hot tub only held 4 people and never really got hot enough, but it was a nice way to relax after sightseeing. The other downside is the metro right across the street is being renovated, so no easy way to get to Vatican City or the Colosseum without taking a taxi. However, the hop on/off bus does stop right outside.",4,2019,06,14
01,Always the Best,My family and I have been going to the Bernini Bristol over three years now. We love being there. We live in Italy 3 months of the year and make sure to be at the Bernini at least 3 to 4 times during our stay. Everyone treats us as if we are family. We like all the Sina properties but Bernini Bristol is the the most pleasurable. All of the staff is extremely helpful and very kind to make reservations at other properties for us during our stay in Italy.,5,2019,06,13
01,Very tradational hotel,"Stayed for two days and was very satisfied.
Front desk personal were the best, they went out of the way to help when I lost my voltage converter to charge my wifi phone & tablet.
Only down side was the bell boy didn't know how any of the room stuff worked.
We were able to figure how to keep the lights on (insert the room card in the slot near the door).
The shower was also a trial & error. Not a bad thing, just different.
I have heard compaints about noise, dind't find any.
Also heard bad reviews about the bar. was  there on Fri afternoon 7:30pm, no problems.
The place was busy and is typical of Italy the service weas relaxed.
It is great but you should expect old school European experience.
",4,2019,06,09
01,Nice centrally located hotel,The Bernini hotel is ideally for discovering Rome on foot. Most of the cultural landmarks are within walking distance. The personnel was very friendly during our stay. We were staying in a room on the 5th floor with a balcony and a nice view overlooking Rome. The room felt a bit dated though but I believe they are refurbishing the hotel at this moment so I guess this is being taken care of.,4,2019,06,09
01,"Hotel Staff was great, rooftop bar staff no so good","Roof top bar could be great! First time we were told it was after 3 so they do not serve any food, no problem we had a drink but the server never came back? The next day we went at 7 for the sunset and were told they dont have a menu but we could get a pizza? Ok that odd that a bar has no menu, we ordered pizza and drinks and after 1 hour and no pizza we left. It the best views in the city, please add some food and better service and it will be great ! ",4,2019,06,02
01,Nice Customer Service. 5 star food...not so much,"We hot in around 2pm. Room wasn't ready? I believe it was a ploy to get us up to the rooftop 5 star restaurant to have us spend some cash right away. We were to get 2 free drinks and the waiter messed that up and we settle for...""just a spirt please"" and still got it wrong.
I broke my tooth on the 3rd bite of bread...UGH! Was Still jetlagged and had motion sickness and stuck at a table waiting for a simple plate of spaghetti. It was the worst $24 plate of pasta I have had and the smallest. Needless to say we were begging for our room. The room was to be updated with a larger balcony....well the floors were still dirty (lament wood) and the balcony was a view of planted bushes.... I mean it would be nice to try and see the city from our room. Oh well . I chalk this u ol to lesson learned. I conclude by saying the hotel service way very nice...until you stepped upstairs into the roof told restuarant. All the help seemed cranky and rude of you didnt want anything than water with your meal. So we ate out on the town every meal. And the food was terrific and less than half the price",3,2019,05,31
01,May 2019,"Excellent location. Nice roof top bar and breakfast service. Very friendly & Clean.
Bathroom shower not great.  Poor ventilation & leaked on the floor and uneven temperature.
No Coffee or ice available in the rooms without calling room service which was not fast.",4,2019,05,31
01,Want to love it but....,"We wanted to give it a 4 but the noise problem can’t be ignored. My wife, daughter and I stayed in late May for 3 nights. The positives:
- the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, no complaints
- the facility is nice, well kept, elevators worked fine
- check-in was easy, no issues
- bed was comfortable, bathroom clean and large
- our rate included breakfast and it was an extensive continental breakfast with plenty of variety
The negatives:
- We had a Deluxe Suite at the front of the hotel facing the Piazza and OMG the noise is pretty much the worst for any hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Piazza Bernini, on which the hotel sits, is quite the thoroughfare for trucks, buses, taxis, cars, etc till 2 to 3 in the morning. Our partial solution was to take my iPad with a white noise app and crank it close to full volume to drown it out. The floors in the hallways are tile/marble so slamming doors, voices and squeaky shoes get amplified. (Note: we had just come from London where we stayed at a hotel next to Trafalgar Square and had no issues because the hotel had double windows....not double paned but two separate windows which totally drowned out the noise.
- The hotel is not a bargain, adding my daughter to the room added €80 to the rate each day
Bottom line: We wanted to really like it but getting 3-4 hours of good sleep per night doesn’t cut it, certainly not at this price point.",3,2019,05,30
01,An excellent stay!,Our stay at the Bernini Bristol was absolutely excellent! The rooms were stunning and beautiful and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The Bernini Bristol was centrally located so it was easy to get around Rome to the necessary sights.  The concierge did an excellent job in making sure we were able to coordinate sight seeing tours and that we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.  I highly recommend this hotel! ,5,2019,05,30
01,Just OKAY; nothing to RAVE about,Great location for walking to major sites; or to pick up the On-Off Tour Bus to get around the City.  The hotel room was tired; the bathroom cramped.  Despite requesting a room with a view; we got one near the elevator that faced the side of another building.  Very disappointing.  The service at the FLAIR on the rooftop for breakfast is slow; had to keep getting up to find someone to bring us coffee.  The dinner at the FLAIR was very good; the presentations were exceptional; but the value for the small portions of each course are questionable.  Very expensive dinner; left hungry.  The Front Desk staff and Concierge were exceptional with every question or request.  So overall... just average...,3,2019,05,30
01,Perfection Hotel,"Came as a group of 6 girls to Rome before leaving on a cruise. Beautiful Hotel, friendly staff and the best view for Breakfest, Lunch or Dinner anywhere in Rome. Only wish the lobby bar was available a little more often. ",5,2019,05,30
01,"Great Location, Great Hotel","We loved our time at the San Bernini Bristol. The location was perfect for a trip to Rome, and the customer service was top notch.

01,Lovely stay! ,"My family and I stayed for 4 nights my parents joint birthdays! 

From greeting to end, the staff were absolutely fantastic in all areas. The catering team were particularly exceptional and the breakfast buffet was delicious! 

",5,2019,05,30
01,Got dumped by Mercenate Palace hotel and rescued by these folks.,"It’s got a grand entrance in a great position.Welcome from reception was excellent,and assistance from the young concierge was kind, efficient and enthusiastic! What an asset to the hotel .
The room was not luxurious, but clean, comfortable and quiet. We would definitely stay here again .
With regard to the restaurant. This is being heavily promoted as the new rooftop venue for sophisticated eating. But....our limited experience indicates problems.Firstly, the pianist mentioned in the advertising is not always there and someone puts this ghastly music loop on permanent play. Plastic  leaves all over one wall gives the wrong impression. The bartender seems to have too much to do serving bar and dining room drinks,the receptionist at the door should help our there ,instead of strolling around looking glamorous.
But mainly I felt that guests exhibited disappointment with the general ambiance on arrival, some turning around and leaving. The food appears to have fine dining aspirations and you can see the chef s working. Is a long beard ok for a chef?
The waiters  seemed very attentive.",4,2019,05,30
01,"Best views in Rome, great service, highly recommend!","Sina Bernini Bristol had helpful staff from front desk, concierge, spa and restaurants. The views from the breakfast room were simply stunning.  Location was great for walking to many significant sights and so nice to come back to a sauna after long days out and about. Highly recommend a stay! ",5,2019,05,30
01,Stay in Rome,"Front desk staff was incredible.  Restaurant staff not very attentive with the exception of one, but he didn't work every day.  The bedroom could use new mattresses as they are very old and you could feel the springs .  Bathroom tub needs a good scrub down.  Our view from room was excellent and the hotel is in a great location. ",3,2019,05,30
01,Perfect Rome Location,Lovely hotel. Super comfy beds.  Delicious breakfast and dinner at rooftop lounge.  Amazing view. Awesome hospitality.  Definitely stay here again.  Front desk very helpful with any questions.  Doorman so kind    Perfect location to everything,5,2019,05,29
01,Excellent Hotel Staff,"Best time to go to Rome- Hotel wasn't crowded, it's right in the middle of all the shops and restaurants  - the Staff was great
Their Rooftop Breakfast Buffett was Excellent - Love their Bread and their fresh juices

01,Close to everything but $$$,"Great hotel, best location, it takes 10 minutes from Terminal to get to this Hotel. Buy public transportation pass, we bought Rome 48, two days pass, take buss 85 or (Nuvetel) to the hotel. Or download MyTaxi app same as Uber but cheaper and get your ride. ",5,2019,05,25
01,Never stay at Bernini,"This place is a dump- not a 4 or 5 star property.  Our family had two suites- while roomy they had not been updated since the 70s.  Mold around air vents, toilet constantly running when it even worked.  Maid service was horrendous.  Although linens and towels were changed daily, dirty dishes and glasses were untouched without replacing them.  The location is good but would never stay there again.",1,2019,05,22
01,Brilliant Location,"This is our second trip to this Hotel and again it did not dissapoint. Nestled between the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps it's just a simple 10 to 15 minute walk to either, travel another 5 - 10 minutes and you at the Pantheon.

The rooms are ""cosy"" but very comfortable, I might be corrected but I don't think the air conditioning extends beyond the open windows but this is usual for European Hotels. But there is heating. 

There were one or two minor maintenance issues with our room but this in no way impacted or stay. 

The staff are brilliant and keen to help.

For mine, the Sins Bernini is an excellent choice when in Rome",5,2019,05,21
01,Enjoyed our stay,"The place was wonderful ! Sandro and Max, Fabrio  were so helpful . These people bend over backwards to help and plan your day. When I am in Rome I will stay at no other place. If there was a ten star rating I would give them 10 stars !!!",5,2019,05,20
01,Family-friendly Roman elegance with an excellent location ,"My husband and I stayed here with our toddler for four nights for both business and tourism.  We can not recommend this hotel more highly. 

The staff are outstanding - friendly, professionals and efficient.  They were incredibly welcoming to our family, including our young child.  

We stayed in a suite overlooking the Bernini square.  It had two generously sized rooms - a bedroom and a living room area with a large bathroom.   The rooms were very quiet and offered great views.   Our room had been recently renovated with beautiful updated finishes.  It included a coffee bar and a mini-fridge. 

The concierge - Dante - was outstanding.  He assisted our family in booking an excellent baby sitter during our stay, referred us to several kid-friendly restaurants, and booked a car for us on less than 12 hours notice with a car seat for our toddler.  The hotel also froze our cooler bags for us which we needed for our child, and made sure we were able to find diapers, wipes, whole milk, etc at the convenience store right next to the hotel.  Prior and during our trip I emailed with the concierge several times and they returned messages within minutes.  

The hotel has a lovely restaurant on the 8th floor with incredible views of the city.  Breakfast was held there during our visit and it was an excellent spread.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, and waffles were offered along with cheese and meats, fruits, and pastries.  The food for lunch and dinner was also excellent.  And the restaurant had a high chair for our child and were so accommodating and friendly. 

Finally, this hotel has an incredible location.  You are right by the Bernini train stop (which is currently closed - but Spaga is just a 10min walk), and this takes you to the Opera, Spanish Steps, and the Vatican and St Peter’s Square.   Trevi Fountain is about 15min walk away, the Colosseum was about a 30min walk away, Spanish Steps about a 10min walk away.  There is a convenience store that is a 1mjn walk, ATMs flank the hotel, and there is a cab stand right outside the front doors.   Numerous restaurants are steps away.   You won’t regret choosing the Sina Bernini Bristol! ",5,2019,05,18
01,Italy vacation with friends,Wonderful visit for couples. Hotel was great. Likewise food was magnificent. We found Rome to be too filled with “street hustlers” at every step through the city to allow us to enjoy. We will not return to Rome other than flying in as airport location only. The surrounding small towns of  Tuscany will be our only vacation sites in the future. ,5,2019,05,16
01,Good organization,"Last week we had an annual meeting at Sina Bernini Bristol. The organization with the hotel was very good and uncomplicated. The breakfast and lunch were very well. Most rooms are modern and renovated. Those who are not definitely need to be renovated. Big advantage is the central location. You can reach almost every place by feet. Not every employee speaks English, that was a bit difficult sometimes. You can hear everything thru the doors, what is extremely disturbing when your room is close to an elevator or the housekeeping room. In addition, we are happy we chossed this hotel.",4,2019,05,16
01,Great location to visit the sights of Rome.,"Very impressive looking building with staff to greet you on arrival who were all very friendly. Room had recently been refurbished which was part of our problem. The bathroom was a wet room without shower screen which flooded onto marble tiles and failed to drain properly. Only a very small area under the shower head was non-slip, the drainage does not appear to have been tested. Our health and safety executive would have a field day with the dangerous flooring.
We complained to reception and were given another room with a conventional bathroom which was much better, and safer.
However little touches confused us, kettle and cups provided in room, but no tea or coffee, it took 4 calls to reception before the coffee was delivered, but without any milk.
There was no hairdryer in the first room, that took 3 calls and two visits to reception before it arrived.
Breakfast was wide ranging to suit all tastes, with plenty of staff available, some however not that well trained in the arts of service to paying guests. The 'hot' food selection was unfortunately tepid at best, the tea bags were delivered in an impressive wooden box, which was taken away before a second cup could be brewed with the plentiful supply of hot water in the jug delivered to the guest.
This could have been so much better, a fantastic building with a roof terrace bar & restaurant, commanding wonderful views of the city.
With a little more attention to details the whole experience should have been much better.",3,2019,05,09
01,Best hotel in Rome,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. The location is central and the service 
is extraordinary.
My daughter and I just stayed there and are indebted to Dante Casale. What a delightful and knowledgeable man. And so charming no matter how small the problem or what time of day. He is a gentleman who truly wants to accommodate you in everyway.  Our trip at the Bernini Bristol was five stars because of Dante.",5,2019,04,30
01,Outstanding Service,"This hotel is top notch. Located at the base of Via Venuto you can walk to the beautiful Borghese gardens, trevi fountain, Spanish steps ,shopping, and many other great locations. My baggage was delayed a day and the concierge called the airline hourly to help track it down. Staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. Then there is the amazing views from the roof bar as well as the breakfast view. We had breakfast included which was a must....delicious fresh ingredients. The room we stayed it was recently updated and very comfortable.",5,2019,04,29
01,Excellent choice for Rome,"This hotel is centrally located yet out of the intense tourist throng. There are taxis always lined up outside. Short walk to Via Veneto and Borghese Gardens. Pharmacy and bank right outside. Walk to Trevi Fountain and all else.It is a beautiful, true 5 star hotel. From the gleaming marble floors and gorgeous hotel room doors, to the impeccable breakfast service, to the excellent front desk staff, this hotel is a ""keeper"" on the list of Rome hotel recommendations!",5,2019,04,29
01,WONDERFUL HOTEL AND SERVICE ,"Excellent service, a very nice and clean hotel. the attention to the client is WONDERFUL, warm, and very personal (always smiling). The food is fresh and tasty.

01,"An excellent hotel, superb service","The hotel was excellent, and in a great location
Spacious rooms with a choice of a modern or a classic design.
The breakfast was great, with high quality food and a large variety.
But thre best thing in the hotel was the service, which was simply the best I ever got - every request for our room, every request for help or advice for the city was answered in the best way possible.
Thank you! We will definitely come back!  ",5,2019,04,26
01,Really great hotel,"Our trip to Italy was great, eleven days around the country.  The last four nights at the Sina Bernini Bristol. We called ahead that it was our daughters 17th Birthday on Easter Sunday.

When we checked in, there was a note in our room for our daughter,  on her birthday there was a desert in the room on her birthday as well.

The rooms are a really nice size (the shower is a little tight), the room s are super clean like the rest of the hotel.

The rooftop restaurant and the staff were way beyond expectations.  The food was magnificent.

But......  the thing that makes this hotel so great is the people.  I’ve been all over the world. The front desk, housekeeping, the restaurants etc... every person we came in contact with, couldn’t have been more helpful or nicer.",5,2019,04,22
01,"Really great hotel, beautifully furnished new floor of bedrooms with terrace/balcony.","Rooms were very well furnished and decorated on this newly refurbished floor. Good air conditioning. Excellent ensuite and shower.

Staff were very attentive and the concierge was very helpful.  Good breakfast choices.

Excellent location, could walk to the Trevi Fountain and many 'hop on and hop off' tourist buses stopped nearby. Taxi rank and Metro (closed for repairs at the moment) also nearby.   Great range of restaurants to choose from in the area.",5,2019,04,19
01,Above average hotel with poor service,"My family and i stayed at this property in March of 2019. The hotel itself was nice, but nothing that is going to blow you away. Location is average in that it really isn't all that close to anything other than the Trevi Fountain. The service was below average as every time we asked any questions we were made to feel like we were putting these people out. I guess some of the rooms were renovated and some were not. Ours was renovated and was nice. However, there was no shower head in our shower, only a hand held, which made it pretty tough to shower. When we asked about it, they sent someone up and then never followed back up with us. the breakfast buffet was very average, and one night when we went to the lobby bar for a drink there wasn't a bartender!!! It felt more like a business hotel than anything else and would be best suited for people that do not need to use the hotel amenities or need any kind of hotel service or assistance. Since we were touring, these problems were not really issues for us.",4,2019,04,16
01,Very disappointing,"This hotel is a great location for many of Rome's attractions but this is the only positive we found during our stay.
Having been lucky enough to stay at a few 5 star hotels, this hotel does not rank with them.
The noise... Yes the hotel is on a busy piazza but it is not the traffic noise that is intrusive, it is the constant slamming of doors (which you have to pull to close rather than turning a handle, consequently most people let them slam shut - including and most frequently the housekeeping staff). There is no soundproofing between rooms so we could hear EVERYTHING that our neighbours were doing. Not pleasant. The lifts bing every time someone gets on or off, the keys to the room buzz. Just constant noise and we are leaving exhausted and looking forward to a decent night's sleep at home!
The room itself is pretty basic, not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. The bed is too hard, the pillows uncomfortable. When we arrived they had given us a twin room despite booking otherwise.
There were facilities to make tea and coffee but no tea and coffee supplied. We innocently phoned down to ask for some, some 15 minutes later it arrived with a 32 euro charge !!??!! We refused to pay. The staff member went away to speak to his manager, who called 5 or so minutes later, insisting that was the cost. We refused again and told them to come and collect the tray. 5 minutes later the phone rings again, this time we are able to have the tea and coffee for FREE, but only for tonight. How gracious. This is a basic room requirement!!
A bottle of water was provided in the room when we arrived but make it last as it won't get replaced.
The toilet doesn't work properly, the shower leaked.
The rooftop bar? 30 euros for a G&T and a barcardi and coke. Really??!!
We would not recommend this hotel. Other than location, it has nothing going for it. Shame.",2,2019,04,09
01,"Great location, friendly staff, clean hotel","As soon as we were dropped off found the staff helpful and informative.Room was lovely and clean it’s a lovely view to the square, Location was ideal we managed to walk to all the attractions. Breakfast was luckily included and a good variety. Didn’t really enjoy the roof top bar was expensive and took ages to get a drink. Staff on the Friday at the bar seemed stressed. Minor gripes as our room faced the square it was very difficult to sleep as it was very noisy.In fairness to reception they did offer to change our room but we were too settled to pack n unpack. Also a tip take towels from room to spa as they are a separate company n charge for towels.Loved the turn down service as they replaced towels n toiletries of an evening as well as the morning. Would stay again as locationi is brilliant and staff were really helpful xx",4,2019,04,08
01,Lovely Hotel and Setting - but...,"We stayed here to celebrate my 65th Birthday and picked a 5 Star Hotel on purpose for this reason. Many aspects of the hotel are excellent.The room was comfortable and spacious but the wardrobe had a broken door handle.

 I must mention the Concierge, Massimiliano. His recommendations for Restaurants and general help in booking them and checking tour pick ups were brilliant, In fact all of the Desk staff and Doormen were fantastic.

 However, there were a few minor faults in our opinion. Like many reviewers I thought the breakfast was disappointing. It didn't really vary from day to day with a limited amount of choice in the hot food department. The toasters worked intermittently and took ages to toast.

Bar prices were rather steep and the Reception Bar had no Red wine when we wanted some! When we had White wine it was barely cool and needed ice in it.

These were minor hitches though and generally this was a super break for us",4,2019,03,24
01,location location location,"Having read so many poor reviews about this hotel, we were a little worried.  No need to worry though,  doorman, concierge and reception staff are first class, helpful and always smiling, a great welcome.  we had a deluxe room which was spacious with a view of the piazza barberini, very comfortable beds, great bathroom with jacuzzi bath, nice to have a window that opens in the bathroom too.  Housekeeping great and nice to have a turndown service with a chocolate, great bathrobes too.  Breakfast was comprehensive and good quality, again service as good,  We didnt eat at the hotel restaurants, but highly recommend the rooftop bar - Wow what a view of the city toward the Vatican,  location is  amazing, next to metro / underground, taxis always available outside the hotel, short walk to spanish steps, trevi and pantheon,  great department store Rinisente short walk with rooftop restaurant / bar.  prices are good, considering location and hotel services.  Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2019,03,13
01,Nice staff - but hotel $$$$,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I guess I should expect as much from a 5 star rated hotel, but I’ve stayed at other hotels in Rome and have had a better experience. This is mainly due to the fact that EVERYTHING at this hotel is overpriced and, frankly, you could get more for your money somewhere else. I ate breakfast somewhere else everyday bc I refuse to pay 20 euros for a smaller breakfast. Laundry was insanely expensive as well (like 7 euros for ONE pair of underwear!!!) if you want to say you stayed at a fancy hotel that is in a  good location, this is the place for you. But if you want more for your money, there are plenty of 4 star rated hotels (near the Trevi fountain as well) that are a MUCH better value. 
TL:DR - staff great , poor value ",3,2019,03,08
01,Breakfasr could be better,"Breakfast could be better very little choice and €10 extra to make an omlette is crazy for a ""5 Star hotel"".Apart from this the reception staff were very nice . But your policy of charging your customers €10 extra for an omlette",3,2019,03,03
01,Great location,We stayed here on a rugby trip. The location of the hotel is fantastic - near all the things to see in Rome. The rooftop has amazing views over the city but you pay for the view as the drinks are expensive. Breakfast is OK but should include an egg bar where a choice of eggs would be available.,4,2019,02,27
01,Great location,"Professional staff, hotel is very clean. Rooms are nicely decorated but we found the bed very firm, and we generally like a firm bed. Nice selection at breakfast but the “hot” food choices were always just luke warm at best. Quick check out, overall a very pleasant stay. ",4,2019,02,27
01,Very poor,"Stayed here for 3 nights assuming it was a 5 star hotel last week. We checked in at 5 pm and were told we would have to wait. Our journey started st 6 am on that Friday so we were exhausted. The room should have been ready since 3 pm!!!! 
Eventually we were given keys to our rooms some of which didn’t work and more trips to reception. Only 1 light worked in our bathroom over the shower. There was no coffee or tea making facilities. There was no hairdryer in the room. We had to contact reception for one. 
Breakfast was appalling. Omelettes were a joke. They were the size of a saucer, flat, and bordering on cold. Scrambled eggs looked gross and bacon was fatty. A hot plate for hot food was out of the question. Coffee was served in a cup and got cold very quickly. Poached eggs cost 10€ extra. It was hard to find anything you might like. The fruit was melon and pineapple if you were down early , prunes were available too. 
The room was basic with a curtain for a wardrobe. There was no complimentary water in the room. 
The location is good as it’s not far from the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. The Spanish steps are nearby too and all the open buses stop nearby for hop on hop off. 
This hotel is a faulty towers. I could not recommend this hotel as a 5 star maybe a 3 star. It was far too expensive to waste the money on. The staff were not very helpful either. If you want 5 star go somewhere else. Very very disappointed",2,2019,02,27
01,Great hotel woeful service,Stayed in this hotel some years ago and it is a great hotel in a fantastic location. It is however badly let down by extremely poor management and service. The trouble started when we checked in and our rooms were not ready at 4pm. The bar was also not open so we couldn't get a drink while we waited.The shelves in our room had not been dusted in some years which we discovered when we put our clothes on the shelf. I took a photograph on my phone with an inscription I left with my finger. Breakfast was not in the breakfast room but on the roof terrace. Nice setting if we had been told and how to get there as the main lifts don't go there. Breakfast was a bit of a struggle as well. No milk jugs or tea spoons. All of the faults are really niggles that would easily be put right with a good management team. The hotel itself is beautiful in a great location but shambolic service.,3,2019,02,24
01,"Location, Location","We had 4 nights at the Bernini and would highly recommend.  The roof top bar and terrace has fantastic views across the city.  Staff are welcoming and very friendly, nothing being too much trouble.  The location is perfect for exploring Rome, lots of restaurants and bars very close, even a pub if you felt inclined.  Whilst the doors are not automatic, there is a doorman there opening it for you. We will be going back again!",5,2019,02,22
01,Even better than we remembered,"We stayed at the Bernini Bristol on our honeymoon and loved the hotel.  I booked a surprise weekend in Rome.  We didn't stay at the Bernini but we did have a meal at the rooftop restaurant which we never ate at when we stayed there.  We decided to have the 7 course blind-tasting menu.  The Executive Chef Alessandro Caputo, originally from Sicily, came out to meet us and explained what he was going to create for us.  It was no surprise that later we learned he had done stints at the Fat Duck in Bray and La Gavroche in London.  As we didn't know what we were going to eat, we had a fine recommendation from the sommelier.  The service was attentive but not intrusive and the food was amazing.  One for a special treat!",5,2019,02,11
01,Amazing hotel!,We really appreciated the amazing service from the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helped us with any issues we had. The rooms were also very nice and the hotel was in an excellent location. 10/10 would return! ,5,2019,02,08
01,The Most Amazing Hotel In Rome,"The best views, rooms and people. I love everything about this hotel. This is the view from the balcony in the lobby. So many areas in the hotel where you can see views just as beautiful as shown in the photo",5,2019,02,08
01,"Great location, excellent staff","Well situated in city center. Colosseum, Vatican and everything in between are only a 25 minute walk from hotel. Great for wandering and discovering Roma. Front desk and concierge staff very friendly and accommodating. Gave great recommendations for food. ",5,2019,01,30
01,Disappointing experience - beware of questionable concierge recommendations!,"We chose the hotel based on the fact that it is centrally located and is listed as a 5-star hotel. The location is undoubtedly ideal for tourists, but the positives end right there. 

First of all, the rooms seem bare and outdated for an alleged 5-star hotel (note: some rooms do have more recently renovated bathrooms but the decor of each room remain bare and outdated). The maid service consistently lacked attention to detail, eg forgetting to replace towels despite taking our used towels, leaving dirty glasses without replacement, etc. 

Secondly, on our first night of the stay at around 2 am, an alarm went off for an extended period of time. Apparently someone may have triggered an alarm in the bathroom but the staff was not aware until we alerted them of the blaring sound on our floor. 

The most frustrating element of our stay was the hotel concierge’s restaurant recommendations. The concierge (Dante) highly recommended a restaurant that clearly was a tourist trap. As a matter of fact, we noticed one of the restaurant staff hanging out right outside of the hotel before the recommendation. 

When we arrived at the restaurant, the waiter convinced us that he would take care of us and told us to order off menu, and we ended up getting charged €50 for a plate of subpar cured meats and cheeses on top of mediocre overpriced pasta that appear not to be freshly made. Our entire bill for three came out to be €150 for a meal that we believe we could have gotten in the frozen foods section of any grocery store. 

We checked Yelp after the dinner and found similar complaints from other patrons. It is expected that the concierge would have special relationships with certain restaurants, but to deliberately send hotel guests to a complete rip-off is disheartening and frankly unconscionable.",1,2019,01,15
01,Rooms with view of Piazza Barberini are a wonder,"Position is excellent, breathtaking views of Rome from roof terrace. Staff are extremely helpful and professional. Rooms are clean, Services at breakfast is impeccable. Overall excellent. A special thank you to the food and beverage section of the  Hotel.",5,2019,01,13
01,Excellent!,"The environment is clean. The employees are very friendly. The best inn I've ever visited. Hopefully there is a chance to stay here again. I happened to leave in December, so the air was cold, even though it hadn't snowed.",5,2019,01,07
01,Wonderful view,"It was a wonderful and beautiful accommodation experience, a view and a beautiful and wonderful view of Rome's traditional places and close to the city center, I would recommend everyone to stay at this hotel, young people or families.",5,2019,01,07
01,Great location and a classy Hotel,"The hotel was booked by Amex travel so I had no idea what to expect. I’ve stayed in Rome previously and had not heard of the hotel. What a great find. Not too small and not overly large. The rooms are very nice and they have a spectacular room top restaurant with outside seating bar with a great view. Service throughout wash great. 
Also, very convenient location.  10 min walk from Spanish Steps and there’s a HOP on Hop Off bus stop out the front door. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,01,04
01,ok hotel in good location,"Hotel is OK, good size clean room but basic decoration and limited facilities. Shower is over bath, not separate, and the shower head kept falling out of its holder!. No facilities for making tea or coffee in the room, cup of tea on room service was EUR10!
No drinking water. The tiny TV did not work and had to call technician.  Staff woke us up at 9.10 am to check the mini bar!  
Very good location but did not feel this was 5 star at all!",3,2019,01,04
01,Wonderful Hotel,Could not have picked a better location to spend the holiday. Very professional and welcoming staff and overall grand service. Absolutely recommend to anyone wanting a fabulous holiday. Will be back for sure...,5,2019,01,04
01,Excellent place,I had a very good time in Rome. The location of the hotel is perfect and the service was very good! Closeby to a metro station  amd to the Termini railway. Easy to walk to the historical center if you do not mind a 20 min. stroll! Nice breakfast.,5,2019,01,04
01,Professional staff with first class service ,"I stayed here for 9 nights. And during my arrival to the hotel, the concierge and the staff greeted me with my family name. And I was pretty surprised. Because this is my first time coming into the hotel and the concierge recognised me by name.

Though the hotel is old, but they are clean and have a nice 1michellin star restaurant on the roof top of the hotel. The food is nice and the price is very very reasonable for what they offered. And from this place, you can have nice view / scenery of Rome. 

Their breakfast is at the 2nd floor/ breakfast floor. Though the selection of the food is not a lot, but the service is impressive. The staff is helpful, polite and attentive. Very well trained. 

Having said the hotel is pretty old, I think this should be a characteristic of the European hotel. But the location is fantastic , and we have a pleasant stay. 
The metro is just few step in front of the hotel door, the taxi is always ready anytime you need , and it is walking distance to tourist destination and shopping mall. 

Recommended. 
They offer first class hospitality and service.",4,2019,01,02
01,Excelent Hotel!!,"Very well located, near the Bernini station. The view from the terrace is fantastic !! Staff very attentive and polite! The restaurant Giuda Ballerino is great !! Large and clean rooms. When I return to Rome I will stay at this hotel again !!",5,2018,12,20
01,Birthday surprise ,"Fantastic hotel very friendly very helpful rooms where spotless, the restaurant is out of this world top floor glass over looked Rome, they have spa facilities and gym it is definitely one to go back to ",5,2018,12,13
01,Prime Location but OK for family,"Really excellent location, walkable to popular sight-seeing places.Travelled with a 1 yr old, and felt the Hotel was more oriented to business people.While we were there there were more than 1 conference, and the restaurants/staff were almost always busy, couldn't cater well for our family needs.Service was either a hit or miss, inconsistent to say the least.",4,2018,12,11
01,Excelent hotel,"Very well located, close to many places to visit in Rome. Excelent cofee break, very polite attendants. The view from the restaurant on the 8th floor is simply wonderful and unforgettable. I Strong recommend Sina Bernini Bristol as a outstanding alternative when visiting Rome.  ",4,2018,11,27
01,Nice Place...If You're Not on Business!!!,"This hotel is in a great location and the staff are very friendly and professional. The lobby is very nice,  and the bar is very comfortable. Unfortunately, the accolades seem to stop there. The rooms are very hit-and-miss, as some have been remodeled and some are in a less modern state. Rooms on some of the floors are under construction. The breakfast leaves a tremendous amount to be desired, as the variety and quality is very mediocre. But perhaps the biggest problem that any business traveler should never have to deal with is the fact that the Wi-Fi and internet connection here is perhaps as unreliable and poor as I have ever experienced in any hotel. Night after night I would return to go tell at midnight with the intention of working for an hour, and yet the poor internet connection and being kicked out of the wi-fi system on a regular basis resulted in me having to work for hours. Frequently the Wi-Fi signals were virtually non-existent, resulting in me having to reboot and reconnect on a very frequent basis. My nightly complaints had no effect, and when the issue was brought to the attention of management the only explanation they had was the fact that their system was not equipped for the amount of Wi-Fi that was being called upon at the time by the number of business Travelers at the hotel, as well as a potential excuse that my room was in a poor location to access the Wi-Fi. I'm not sure why any business traveler would ever run the risk of staying at a hotel where this type of explanation would even be offered by management as it is not even remotely acceptable. The manager at the hotel did not even come close to offering any type of logical explanation nor did he make any meaningful effort to empathize. I have had far superior internet connections at hotels where I paid significantly less than this hotel, which promotes itself as a 5-star hotel. At best, I would suggest at this hotel is 3.5 Stars, but its Wi-Fi connection is barely one star. To be clear, many of the guests that I spoke to at the hotel had similar complaints, so mine was not unique. Would I stay at this hotel again? Never!",1,2018,11,09
01,Best location-lovely room-huge buffet-friendly-A+ beds,Best location for sights views shopping. Room lovely-everything worked-clean. Old world charm but they're updating and expanding soon(sigh). Big buffet w huge view of gorgeous fountain plaza/skyline. Staff want to please and nice. VERY comfy beds. Book Vatican ahead w concierge-good tips about getting into popular sights. Ate at the rooftop restaurant Guida Ballerino--AMAZING delicious inventive-what a view. Will return,5,2018,11,09
01,Sina Bristol Rome,"Overall good quality.
Breakfast and restaurant food and service excellent. 
Most times the door men seemed to be watching us open the door while they chat to reception staff. However our man on check out was exceptional. Nothing wrong with my arms so I'm all good. 
We booked on the day we arrived and recieved a clean room at the rear of the hotel. Our room needed a little TLC, it's been so well used that the toilet is no longer secured to the floor!",4,2018,11,02
01,Terrace room not really available,"OK accomadations and friendly staff.  2 of our 4 nights the terrace bar (with the view of the City) was ""closed"" due to private parties.  Very disappointing! --( considering this is a plus for the hotel.  Otherwise location and hotel weren't that special.",4,2018,11,01
01,4 Star.... not a 5 Star,"2 rooms, 3 nights at the historic Sina Bernini Bristol. Checkin was smooth although rooms were not ready till 3PM. The hotel was incredibly busy as there was a film festival taking place at the hotel. We got upgraded to a Suite on 7th floor overlooking the square. Suite was surprisingly basic....was expecting more opulence. The skyline views of Rome were amazing. There was a massive hailstorm while we were there and the lightning show was spectacular.

Pros -   Great location - 15-20 minute walk to Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps etc; AC worked really well in our room;  Wifi was good; Bed was comfortable; 5 minutes from Termini train station; concierge arranged private tour of Vatican which i highly recommend.

Cons - no separate shower (and i hate the narrow slippery bathtubs); water alternated to hot and cold during shower; the breakfast was pretty basic (make-your-own waffles was my highlight);  roof was closed was closed for private party; concierge restaurant recommendations were tourist traps; seems to be popular with Chinese tour groups. 

I would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,10,27
01,"Great Location in Rome, but Hotel Didn't Impress","This hotel was a little bit of a let down.  It is a classic, old style, European decor and ambiance....that's fine, nothing wrong with that, but once in the rooms, you feel like they could use some updating.  Anyway, besides that, there wasn't really much to rave about besides the location.  Breakfast was not that great.....I expected more.....the buffet was nothing special.  Staff wasn't overly friendly or welcoming.  The ""spa"" seemed sketchy to me...I looked, but didn't even try.  Cannot comment on restaurant on roof, never ate there, but went up one night around 9:30 and wasn't even greeted by anyone, so we left.
You kind of leave this hotel feeling like you didn't get your money's worth.  :-(",3,2018,10,26
01,Okay,"I stayed at the Sina Bernini Bristol with my wife for 2 nights in August 2018.  The hotel is located at the heart of Rome with close proximity to the shops of Via Del Corso. The Colosseum, Pantheon and Trevi Fountains are also within a walking distance. There’s a rooftop restaurant big enough to host a large group but the rooms are quite basic. I’d stay here again for the location. ",4,2018,10,22
01,5 Star ,Stayed here for one night prior to going on our Mediterranean Cruise. The hotel has and Old style European opulence type of feel with great service from staff encountered. Room were very clean and we were lucky to have a view overlooking the square and fountain. Very conveniently located and within a comfortable walking distance (about 15minutes) to the Trevi Fountain and other wonderful sites.  Lots of food options and eateries in the area with great Gelato & authentic Italian pizza! Enjoyed exploring the neighborhood around the hotel. ,5,2018,10,17
01,NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL!,"I paid $700 a night for a junior Suite and was woken ever day by POUNDING from furniture being dragged across the floor above us in the restaurant that is on the 8th floor.  We complained, they said it would not happen again. It happened Morning & Night Twice a day.  They are all aware that anyone that stays in this room will have to deal with this awful thudding and pounding noise daily, yet they put us in this room anyway. 

Nothing worked in room when we arrived, mini bar broken, air condition broken. Management gave lip service to our complaints about the noise and did nothing about it. 

Breakfast, which we pre-aid for, is a joke and the worst we've encountered traveling in Europe. No fresh coffee or fruit, and not even an omelette station, just vat of runny ORANGE scrambled eggs. 

This place is a 2 star joint with 5 star prices.",1,2018,10,07
01,"High Expectations, Disappointing Experience!","I first came across the Sina brands when I walked passed their hotel in Florence and was amazed at the elegance and friendliness of the staff when I enquired about the hotel. It was a no brainer that based on this and a number of outstanding reviews that for my upcoming stay in Rome I chose to book with them. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by staff who assisted us with our luggage and opening the doors into the hotels foyer. Staff at the front desk were also very pleasant to deal with and assisted us promptly. 

We were advised (at 1500) that our room was not ready and were offered a welcome drink to which we enjoyed magnificent views of Rome's city from the rooftop. Unfortunately, this is where the positive experience ended. Upon returning to the front desk approx. 45mins after we had arrived our room was still not ready.

Due to arrival and departure times for our flights, we had less than 2 full days in Rome and having paid for use of a room for 2 nights we were very keen to make the most of our stay.

Staff arranged to change our room which judging by the website images was an upgrade however, came with some disadvantages. We were now facing the main Piazza which was extremely noisy and one of our requests was room furthest from elevators and main street which was not fulfilled. Nonetheless, we decided to not say anything as we did not want to impact our plans for the remainder of the evening - it was now 1830. 

Breakfast was impressive with a vast selection of sweet and savoury options as well as a waffle maker. Plenty of milk options extending to Soy, Almond & Rice milk which is great for Vegans.

As we were departing the hotel early and would miss the following mornings excellent buffet breakfast we made arrangements with the front desk to have breakfast brought to our room as we had paid extra for breakfast to be included in our room rate.

After a nice dinner offsite and returning to the hotel at approx. 2000, we decided to go up to the rooftop bar and watch the sunset. Upon arrival, we were rudely turned away from the rooftop by workers due to a private function. There was no signage anywhere in the hotel or that suggested the area was closed and staff spoke to us in a manner that was extremely dismissive, condescending and as though we should have known there was a function.

I was completely taken by surprise by this staff members actions, that I returned to the front desk and requested to speak to the manager about our experience. He was incredibly apologetic and calm however, the damage was done and there was really not much at this point that could be done to change and impact our overall experience. The manager re-accommodated our room on a higher floor which now did not face the main Piazza. I re-confirmed that we had arranged breakfast to be sent to our room at 0530 the following morning as we had an early flight to catch and was reassured this would be taken care of.

The following morning came with no surprise that by 0545 a call to the concierge was required to follow up our breakfast. This was delivered in a timely manner from the call being made however, was one final disappointment from the hotel. Our breakfast was a bag filled with a number of pre-packaged sweet and savoury items which was a far cry from what we were promised and expected would be delivered to our room in the morning.

We booked this hotel believing that with 5 star rating and the (overpriced) money we spent would be a nice way to treat ourselves to the end of a long holiday in Europe and have the opportunity to experience outstanding service and we sadly left un-relaxed, lost for words and having felt like we wasted money that could've been spent on a far more memorable experience or purchase.

Will not be returning to this hotel!",1,2018,10,05
01,The perfect place to stay...,"We arrived early so our room was not ready. I think they're pretty firm on the 1500 pm check in time. No problem, we checked our bags and headed out for a walk. The staff were very pleasant and everyone spoke English. Our room was beautiful! Rm #216 beside the elevator but it was very quiet with a patio with table and chairs outside. The bed was comfortable with extra pillows. Very nice bathroom. Your key card turns everything on when the card is inserted. You can control the thermostat. Breakfast buffet was included. Walking distance to Spanish Steps (Scalinata di Trinita) and Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi). Cabs available in front of the Hotel as early as 0616 am. Although the hotel was being renovated you wouldn't know it inside. Wonderful dinner on the rooftop terrace at sundown that we will never forget! Thank you! Grazie!",4,2018,09,29
01,"Truly, best Place in Rome to stay...","The Sina Bernini consistently offers 5 star classic elegance!  This was our second stay, and holds true for the other four Sina properties we've stayed at.  The rooms are spacious, classis and luxurious, quiet, I love the Blaise Mautin bath amenities and marble bathrooms! We very much enjoyed our upgrade to a Junior Suite which was like a 3 room elegant apartment. The entire property is luxurious and elegant, from lounge areas (best Bellini's), to rooftop restaurant, amazing views, tallest in the city. The breakfast/brunch is truly the best we've experienced anywhere, you need a week to explore all the delectable wonders (example, a white chocolate version of Nutella on the best waffle I've ever had, sorry mom) We enjoyed learning the history of Count Ernesto Bocca who began the Sina hotels 60 years ago, with the Villa de Medici in Florence (where my husband proposed to me), and his son and daughter continue the tradition.  We have also stayed at the Sina property in Perugia (highly recommend, incredibly special place and perfect stop on your way to Tuscany, Florence or Milan), and Parma.  We cannot wait for our next visit to the lovely Bernini, and then we plan to explore the new location in Capri.  The Bernini is so close to everything, we walked to the Colloseum, the Vatican, Gregory's Jazz Club, famous Harry's, Hard Rock, and to see the Three Tenors at St. Paul's Cathedral. I could write a book.
If the highest level of a luxury boutique experience is what you are seeking, you will find it with the Sina properties, starting with the Bernini...",5,2018,09,21
01,Very enjoyable stay!!,"A very professionally run hotel with good room size and facilities. The upstairs restaurant and bar is very expensive relative to other eateries outside. The staff were excellent being most helpful with advice and directions.
Housekeeping was above average.

Would definitely stay there again!",4,2018,09,21

Front desk was efficient and generally the hotel was very good.  Cab's were easily available as this is also a Siverseas Cruise Hotel that services customers in transit. 
The major plus is the location again, not say that everything was real close but it all was walkable from the Bernini. There also was a rooftop with a bar and restaurant but we heard it was very expensive. Would I stay there again? yes.",4,2018,08,29

01,Vaction,Stayed at the Berni Bristol Hotel. We stayed there many years ago and it was very nice. This time we had issues like the air conditioning system was not working and it was very uncomfortable. It was very warm in Rome when we were there.,3,2018,08,21
01,Old Rundown - Little to No A/C,"Location is good but that’s it. Old broke down facility. Virtually no air conditioning, bathroom sink leaks on the floor from drain (gross). Roof-top bar is over-the-top expensive. Save yourself from disappointment, go elsewhere on your next stay in Rome. ",2,2018,08,21
01,Great hotel and location,"This well situated hotel sits at the top of the Piazza Barberini.  After dropping our luggage in the very pleasant room, we went straight to the top of the hotel where our very first experience of being in Rome was having wine, cheeses, crackers, etc while sitting and looking out over the piazza with all of the city behind it, including the Vatican in the distance. WOW!  The hotel staff, the location, the advice for where to go, all of it couldn't have been better.  Everything is in walking distance, though we put in the miles hoofing it all day.  That said, the ""Hop On Hop Off"" buses stop right outside the hotel, so if you have a two day pass, as we did, you could use it not just for touring but as a mode of transportation when you want to give your feet a break.    Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,18
01,Nice to be back,"It has been many years since we have stayed at the Bernini and we were so glad to return.
There have been some renovations since and a wonderful restaurant and bar on the roof with magnificent views of Rome.
We had exceptional service from all the staff especially Chiara and would highly recommend the Bernini to anyone looking for a nice comfortable stay in Rome.
Look forward to seeing everyone again real soon.",5,2018,08,17
01,Great location,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group.  We were treated very well by the friendly and helpful staff.

The hotel looks a bit ordinary from the outside but has a much more luxurious feel inside with lots of marble.  The main lounge area on the ground floor is very, very nice.

Our room was also very nice.  Comfortable bed, good sized bathroom and the room was also a good size.  Plenty of room for suitcases etc.

The buffet breakfast was very nice.  Lots of choice and all fresh and tasty.  

The location of the hotel is a bit offputting on first view because of all of the traffic but there are traffic lights to help overcome this.  The square in front of the hotel is a bit boring but the fountain is nice.

Make sure you take the time to go up to the top floor where the restaurant is for some lovely views over the city.  Stunning at night.

The hotel is within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc.  Also lots of restaurants within walking distance.",5,2018,08,16
01,Excellent hotel,"We had a great experience here our first time in Rome a few years back, and felt compelled to come here again. Indeed, we were greeted with the same helpfulness, professionalism, and top quality accommodations that we experienced last time. The concierge staff couldn’t be more helpful, recommending great dining places and even lending us umbrellas in the midst of a torrential downpour. While the WiFi isn’t ultra fast and the pillows have room for improvement, this was balanced out by a comfortable bed, elegant bathroom, and friendly cleaning staff. Add to that its central location, and you’ve got yourself a great package. I can say without hesitation that I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Rome.",5,2018,08,15
01,Good hotel with fantastic views of Bernini Square!,"We stayed here for one night and booked a double room....the receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a Deluxe room which was on the 5th floor with a balcony directly facing the Bernini fountain.  This was quite magical...having a stunning city view.

The room was quite nice, nice firm double bed with a walk in wardrobe.  The bathroom was big although the shower was in the bath...and not a standalone shower.  The air-conditioning did not work which was very disappointing as it was crazily hot outside....we complained a couple of times and a handyman was sent up who said he couldn't do anything, except giving us a fan!  For a 5 star hotel to not have air con during August is absolutely crazy!

We tried the spa downstairs and it was average (the jacuzzi had dirty water and the steam room smelt of mould)....it wasn't cleaned much!!!  Also, if you wanted a towel...you'll have to pay €5 each...best remember to take one from your room!

It also has a roof top bar (American bar) which was quite nice, although air con up there was disappointing.  Overall it's an average 4.5* hotel which is trying to be a 5*.",4,2018,08,14
01,Very special experience,"Wonderful staff, especially delightful  Chiara, ensured that our stay was utterly memorable. A fantastic central location with well appointed accommodation. Our weekend break felt a lot longer because we enjoyed our stay so much.

We stayed at a sister property in Florence and expected the same if not a better property.  However, this hotel has some work cut out for it to boost my rating.  Our location on the 7th floor was wonderful.  That is until they had to take one of the lifts/elevators out of commission leaving only one working in the main bank of elevators... this made for a LONG wait and the stairs were not an option with 2 senior citizens. Check-in was smooth as half the rooms were ready well before check-in and the following 2 available within the hour.  The issues began with the 3rd room (714) which had a leaking in the ceiling due to the A/C.  The leak caused a hole in the ceiling panel which looked like it needed immediate fixing.  The technician, which I was informed would be there in 20 minutes didn't show up for several hours.  Issue fixed was what I was told...however, the ceiling was still dripping onto the hardwood floor when checked and no patchwork done on the ceiling hole (size of a quarter or 2Euro coin)... Thus, room was taken out of inventory and we had to move rooms.  Turns out the room across the hall was also taken out of commission as the ceiling was being serviced (assuming the same issue) and something large was being replaced.   The re-assigned room (710) does not get a good WiFi signal so you either have to reconnect or stand by the hall door.  The side of the hotel has scaffolding (which we were informed of the construction) which only partially obstructed the view once you approached the window.  The only pitfall was the construction lift (elevator) meant that the workers could see right into the room and watch you if you were sitting at the desk or on the edge of the bed.  If you opt to stay here in the next month or so... just avoid any room ending in 10.  
The hotel does have a lovely lobby and lounge area.  Plenty of seating if you need to wait   for any reason or just want a place to read and relax.  The rooftop restaurant/bistro/bar has some amazing views and should not be missed.  The food is very good for a hotel.  The only disappointment when it came to food was the breakfast.  It was very sub-par for this caliber of a hotel.  The make-your-own waffle station was the only truly edible item.  Scrambled eggs were very runny (and I like mine wet) and the omelets were overcooked and then left to further dry out in the chaffing dish. Reminded me of a mini-frisbee. Fruit was good.  Bacon and Sausage left a lot to be desired.  Pastries ...pass.   Coffee was weak.  They did have a nice assortment of juices and even offer a gluten free selection.  For an included breakfast it did have a lot to offer, but quality-wise it just did not meet the standard that this hotel is known for.
The staff were all very accommodating and friendly.   They went out of there way to make sure all needs were met.  The staff would be one of the reasons to return after the construction and little idiosyncracies are ironed out.  The issues stated should not be deal breakers, just issues that can and hopefully will be fixed.  
The location is wonderful as you are in walking distance to so many of the sites - Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, high-end shopping, side alley shops, Piazza Navona, etc..  The #85 bus will take you right to the Colisseum and from there a short walk to a number of other sites and neighborhoods (like Trastevere).
This is an older hotel, I believe it is a former palace from back in 1874 so there are going to be some issues, but again, nothing that cannot be fixed.  If you can get a discounted rate this property is worth a stay.

01,Disappointed ,"We stayed here as part of a cruise package. We have been to Rome before and we were disappointed with this hotel.

 We didn’t  particularly like the location, the area seems a bit run down and the square is a busy traffic island unlike the location of other hotels that we have stayed in. 

The room quality was poor eg the tap was loose  and the door frame was hanging off   Also beware if you are allergic to  scent , there was an overpowering smell of “ air freshener “

The breakfast was not 5* quality. 

The redeeming feature is the amazing view from the roof top bar and restaurant. Even this 
had its problems. The staff were busying about doing nothing and it took ages to get served.

There is a scaffold up and building work on the side of the hotel. It depends where you room is whether you will be affected. 

All in all we enjoyed our time in Rome but definitely would not stay here again. ",3,2018,08,05
01,Terrible,"Aircon didn’t work properly & room was unbearably hot. Had scaffolding & building works right outside our window (which we weren’t informed about), or offered a discount for. Paid full premium rate for our room. Absolute rip off!!!",1,2018,08,01
01,Nightmare!,"It's not a hotel, it's a construction site!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Two days at this hotel and two days in a row from 8 am in the morning unbearable noise!
Vacation Nightmare.
Wake up to Congo noise, hammers, drills and just no one cares.",1,2018,08,01
01,Excellent service and location,"The hotel is in a convenient location, nice sized suites and comfortable. The facilities are adated and decor in some suites too gaudy for our taste. 
But - most of this hotel meets the bare basic expectations of any hotel charging the big $$$$ 

What sets it apart for us is the great service. Right from the time we were welcomed by the bellman to the front desk the smiles were genuine and conversations friendly. Our room had trouble with the AC making the scorching heat unbearable. The front desk apologized and made arrangements for an alternate and better suite for us. In addition they left us a nice apology note on our desk for the inconvenience. Wow! 

The staff cannot help the challenges with the facilities but they certainly do their best and that makes a difference. 

Breakfast was not too great and surprisingly we never got to even see the check. We were brushed off with a “we will bill to your room”. Curious to see how much we did end up paying. 😊😊

01,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!","On our arrival, we were greeted by a very welcoming doorman, followed by a lovely welcome from Chiara at the reception area. We chatted and mentioned that this visit to Rome was for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. Chiara chatted with enthusiasm, and we had a laugh with her. She advised us that we had requested a deluxe room with a balcony, and this was the room that we were given...........the room exceeded our expectations. A lovely balcony overlooking the City, lovely bedroom and bathroom, everything that we wished to have. To put the icing on the cake, we received a bottle of bubbles on ice, with a lovely signed card from the General Manager, giving  their Congratulations on our Anniversary. All the staff throughout our stay were polite, helpful, and courteous. The hotel is situated in a perfect position,as you can walk to all of what Rome has to offer.... Would we return to Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel?.....most definitely.",5,2018,07,28
01,When in ROMA,"The hotel is elegant and chic  but it is the staff that makes the Bernini 5 star.

From the Doorman to the Reception desk  the staff radiates warmth concern and kindness with every interaction .

Nothing was too difficult for the concierge from procuring private transportation to arranging dinners at the last moment  . 

The hotel amenities are better than the Ritz with the included breakfast being way, way .way over the top, in both selection and attentiveness to fresh selections.

 Morning Meal service  was leisurely  and unobtrusive   Typical selection   included prime  Italian meats variety  of fresh cheeses ,juices and pastry You  must  ASK your server to whip up   a fresh Sicilian OrangeJuice.. YUM YUM YUMMIE.

The roof top bar   is HEAVENLY as you can touch the clouds and 3/4 of ROMA is in your eyes vantage .

Location is everything and Bernini is in th eheart of shopping sight seeing and cultural districts ..

We highly recomend the big red bus  or the pink bus  to sight see both run late and allow you multiple day & night trips for 15/20 Euro,
Best of all 25 feet from the Bernini is the bus stop for all on and off bus lines ..  great way to get ones bearings  and plot the days activities ...    SUPERB STAFF , FOOD  DRINK AND ACCOMIDATIONS   ..Did I MENTION the basement spa area ??  YOU must indulge it to believe it and it is included with ones room ..",5,2018,07,24
01,Rome,Great hotel!!! In the center of history.  Easy to get to.  The staff was excellent.  Very knowledgeable of the area.  Breakfast buffet was very good and roof top restaurant and bar had great views.  Rooms were small and bathroom shower had low pressure.  AC was minimal not like US.,4,2018,07,23
01,AC was a problem ,"I stayed here with my son during the first week of July. The location was pretty good, and the hotel was clean and somewhat elegant. 

However, the AC in our room was definitely unacceptable. We had stayed at 2 other hotels in Italy prior to arriving here, and had no AC issues at the other hotels. Our hotel room was warm, and setting the thermostat lower had no impact. We called and asked to have the AC looked at. They said they would do so, but that took multiple hours. After returning from dinner, we were told that our window had been open and that was the problem for the warm temperature. When I went to the room, it was not any cooler. I was told that the hotel was completely sold out and there were no other rooms available. We were offered a fan for our room. The gentleman who brought us the fan said that we could not controls the AC temp from our room. At this point it was close to midnight. The fan ended up making the room tolerable for the night. But this is not what I expected from a five star hotel. 

The next morning, I was offered to switch to a junior suite which was in fact much cooler. I noticed that the junior suite had four vents for AC versus the one vent that was in our original room. The bathroom in the junior suite was not as nice, and the shower was very small. But I decided I’d rather have better AC than a better shower. 

The staff on the second day was very apologetic. We were sent wine and a fruit plate from the hotel. They followed up with us in the afternoon to make sure we were comfortable. 

I see from other reviews that the AC is an ongoing issue. I would recommend not staying here during the summer months for this reason. The hotel is nice enough otherwise. ",3,2018,07,21

Thank you for all your attention and information every one was helpful in whatever my family needed   ,"  Chiara thank you for all attention you all gave us while my family stayed  with you especially to chiara at the desk  we hope to come back soon  breakfast was excellent service excellent from the floor manager  down  thank you again a presto from the Severino family from Orange County ",5,2018,07,18
01,Beautiful Hotel,I just returned from a 10 day trip to Italy and had the pleasure of staying at the SIna Bernini Bristol. It was a truly lovely hotel. The rooms are nice and spacious. The hotel is very clean.  My only complaint was that one afternoon the maid who cleaned our room did not do a very good job; our floor was not swept and the towels were not replaced and no new ones added. The restaurant staff for the breakfast are FANTASTIC and the food was amazing. So many options to choose from and they make an amazing cappuccino!! Overall its in a decent location and very clean nice hotel.,5,2018,07,18
01,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed 5 nights at this quaint hotel located in the center of many historical and beautiful places to see. The concierge staff was very helpful.  The room was clean, comfortable and quiet even though it was only on the second floor. Walking distance to the Spanish steps, the Pantheon,  the Verdi Fountain and much more. ",5,2018,07,17
01,Great location and average hotel,"Our room the first night was horrible!  No a/c (hotel had a/c). I was told that no other rooms were available.  I would have left, but I prepaid my room.  It was allegedly a deluxe room (scary that was deluxe).  The hotel upgraded us the next 3 nights to a junior suite.  That was an improvement, but that bathroom had a TINY shower.  I’m pretty sure it was smaller that some cruise shower stalls I have been in.  There was a tub in the bathroom, but no shower head in there.  Not sure why they did that since my “deluxe” room the previous night had the shower in the tub.  The room was “old world” which was fine.  The bed was a normal height (unlike the bed in my “deluxe” room), but the sheets weren’t too nice.  Like other reviewers, I’m not sure what makes this hotel 5 stars.",2,2018,07,13
01,"Outdated, poor service and overpriced: not a 5-star experience!","Starting with positives: the location is excellent, very central and with good transport links.

Check-in: very impersonal; the receptionist was doing my check-in while multitasking and talking to other people. I had to ask for the information regarding breakfast, check out, etc rather than the hotel telling me ‘the basics’. First impressions count, and this was a very poor start.

The room: I paid for a Superior room. The size was ok, but it was outdated, it look tired and with facilities (e.g. old tv) that would expect in a 1-star hotel, but not in 5-star one. The bed was not very comfortable with very hard pillows.
Attention to detail is non existent ( for the price I paid I would have expected at least a complimentary bottle of water, which is standard in any 5-star hotel) . There were no toiletries in the bathroom and I had to ask twice to reception (and had to wait a considerable time) before someone brought them to my room. 
To top it up, the room was literally next to major scaffolding and very noisy building work. The very loud noise from the building work started at 7am. Nobody told me anything at reception that I would be woken up by heavy banging on the walls, even as a courtesy. 

I travel to Rome  for work on a regular basis and needless to say I won’t ever come back to this hotel 

",1,2018,07,10
01,Great stay and worth the price,"We were recommended this place by our amazing travel agent and loved it! The staff are wonderful and the location is really nice. You are close to all the great sites- closest to Trevi fountain and the Pantheon. The Spanish steps are close too with all the wonderful designer shops in that location. 

We stayed in a junior suite which was pricey but nice. Our daughter had a bed and it gave us some privacy. 

The breakfast was included and really wonderful! Great place even though pricey",5,2018,07,09
01,Never Ever Stay Here.....0 star hotel,"This was absolutely the worst experience I’ve ever had at any hotel.  Let’s start with the room.  Stained sheets, stained furniture, lumpy bed that felt like hay/straw was used to make it, the most uncomfortable pillows I’ve ever had, floor molding falling off the walls, slippery shower floor to the point where you couldn’t move without falling (my wife fell down during her first shower. She’s an extremely active 30 year old.)

Now onto breakfast.  Dirty, smelly plates, eggs that were very grey and smelled/tasted like rotten fish, meats tasted very foul (imagine licking the floor of a barn), low low grade motel style waffle machine, and to top it off on our last morning we found a long blonde hair BAKED into our pastry.  You could literally hold onto the hair and swing the pastry around like a yo-yo.  DISGUSTING.  You pride yourself on claiming that you have a Michelin star chef.  I would be ashamed if I was a chef and my name was associated to this dump.

Amenities.  The spa is false advertisement. They claim they have a jacuzzi and a Turkish bath. Nope.  Just a four person jacuzzi.  We went down to use the facilities and found 2 young children running around and using the jacuzzi as a play pool.  The lady working the spa told us to use quiet voices while we were using the spa, as there were screaming children running around.  Then we were told towels are 5 euros each, or go back to your room and grab a towel for free. Are you kidding me?!?!?!  That’s not a 5 star hotel experience!!

Management: don’t even bother complaining to them.  Upper management doesn’t care at all. We were told that he wanted to speak with us the next day after we had calmed down, and that if every guest had the mentality that we have, they would be out of business.  Extremely condescending.  Oh and by the way we ran into 3 other groups that were upset about their experience and were either in the process of complaining to the front desk, or venting to us about it saying they had similar experiences.  

0 star hotel.  I don’t even think you can call this a hotel.  How on earth does this place call themselves a 5 star hotel?  Save your time, energy, and money. Go anywhere else.  Tourist trap at the highest degree.  I will never even think of staying at any of the Sina hotel locations around the world.  Can’t speak about any of their other locations, but this one desperately needs to be shut down....or be bought out by a hotel brand that actually knows how to run a proper 5 star hotel experience.",1,2018,07,09
01,"Dirty Hotel, Inedible Breakfast","We stayed here for 3 nights. From the moment we arrived, the experience was negative. Dirty rooms, gross food, stained sheets and furniture, rude staff who asked us not to leave a review, and a long blonde hair baked into a croissant. We reported our experience and while the staff was apologetic, they flat out said “we will talk to you after you’ve calmed down. If every guest was like you, we’d be out of business.” Unbelievably rude and condescending. Our concerns were not outrageous nor were they uncalled for. If we pay for a “five star” hotel then I’d expect our sheets to be clean and for there to be no hair in our food. The towel hooks were falling off and pulling the padded wallpaper away from the walls. The spa was dirty and filled with kids. There were no Turkish baths, so don’t be fooled by that. 

You’d be better off at a Motel 6. ",1,2018,07,09
01,Great hotel with stunning views from cocktail bar & restaurant,"Sina Bernini Bristol is a great hotel in a convenient location, close to cafes, restaurants, shopping & bus stops
Our room was comfortable, quiet & of average size for a couple travelling with luggage for a cruise
Staff were helpful & polite, speaking English if required.. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice, served in a lovey room on 1st floor with views
Cocktail bar on rooftop has great views. Restaurant looked good but pricey - did not eat there",5,2018,07,04
01,Our 25th wedding anniversary stay in Rome,"Although the Sina Bernini Bristol apprears to be a beautiful hotel, in fact the rooms are uncomfortable and air conditioning unacceptable. After sending 2 maintenance men to our room who told us there was nothing wrong with the AC unit, they finally agreed to change our room after 2 nights of our 4 night stay. When they showed us the room which was a few doors down on the same floor, it appeared to be actually smaller and did not seem to be any cooler so we declined. I would not recommend this hotel. I am sure there are better hotels in Rome. The best part of this hotel is the roof top restaurant's view. The food is just ok and overpriced. Ironically we stayed in a Sina hotel in Florence that was amazing and top notch. Hard to believe they are from the same collection!",2,2018,07,04
01,Rooftop restaurant is overrated and overpriced,"This review is for the Rooftop restaurant.  Our group of 4 had dinner here.  The view of Rome is fantastic. The food was good but way overpriced.  The wine service was nothing short of bizarre.  It was obvious that the people there knew very little about wine and wine service yet charge exorbitant prices for the wine. They did not open any of the wines at the table which is an absolute no no - this is NEVER done anywhere.  Then, they poured wine to taste the bottle of Brunello we were buying from another bottle that they were pouring glasses from - just bizarre and totally incompetent. The food service was fine but nothing to get too excited about.  There seemed to be too many employees running around, a number of them doing nothing really and it honestly looked like the Keystone Kops.  All in all, the restaurant is too overpriced and not that great - I would not recommend anyone going here. Find another restaurant for fine dining.",3,2018,07,02
01,AMAZING hotel & GREAT staff,"Everyone at the Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel in Rome is amazing and accommodating…starting with the owner.  I was staying at a nearby hotel and was very unhappy with how small the room was. I happen to be having dinner and drinks on the rooftop of the Sina Bernini Bristol Hotel, where the view was spectacular and the food was excellent, when I met the owner.  I told him about my unhappiness with my current hotel room and he told me his hotel had rooms available at the same price.  I took a look at the rooms and they happen to be much bigger and more beautiful.  I made the decision to switch hotels.  A couple of days after I checked into the Sina Bernine Bristol, I became sick.  I spoke with the concierge and they had a doctor who spoke English in my room within 15 minutes. The owner and staff went out of their way to accommodate me every time I needed them.   In addition, to me this is a real authentic “Rome” hotel. It has all the charm and style of old Italy yet with all the modern conveniences.  I have nothing but raving reviews on this hotel and their staff.  I’d like to add that I travel a great deal and tend to be very demanding.  This hotel was so impressive, it’s the first time I felt compelled to write a review.",5,2018,06,29
01,Best hotel with kids in Rome,"We stayed in one of the suite with 2 kids at the end of our Disney Mediterranean cruise, and felt very much at home relaxing in the spacious rooms, a much needed stretch from the cabin.  There is a large bedroom with view of the Piazza Barberini and the Triton Fountain.  It is connected with a spacious sitting room that easily fits 2 twin sized beds for the kids.  The bathroom is spacious and modern.  The beds are comfortable.  The staff is very courteous, always with a smile.  The doorman was super nice, gave candies to our kids who felt worn out after our tour at the Vatican City.  We have a complimentary bottle of wine, and a free expresso machine.  Unfortunately the roof top restaurant was booked up, need to reserve ahead of time.  WIFI is free.  The location is good, very close to the Via Veneto, the swanky area of Rome.  The Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain are within walkable distance (a safe comfortable walk at night past the Trevi Fountain back to the hotel after enjoying late tea at Babingtons Tea Room and a sunset view at the top of the Spanish Steps).  Colosseum is a short taxi ride away.  The price is reasonable for the size of the suite, especially compared to other 5 star hotels in Rome.  A small complaint was that we could not check in early, unlike most other 5 star hotels we stayed at before.  But overall we had a great experience and highly recommend this hotel.  Our kids like it so much that they wanted to extend their stay there.",5,2018,06,28
01,Outstanding hotel,"We stayed here the last 4 nights of our 3 week Europe vacation. Our room was beautiful, very clean, and the service and hospitality throughout the hotel were outstanding.

01,Great location,"Before getting to the hotel, I was a bit worried about the reviews of this hotel.  I was happily surprised that the hotel was clean, friendly...however, may not be as I would expect for the cost I was paying per night.  In addition, the view from the room was nothing to write home about.  Lastly, the bathroom was clean, however, the shower floor was a death trap.  It was so slippery, we had to put a wet towel on the shower floor to minimize slipping.  ",3,2018,06,21

01,Okay,"We stayed 3 nights. 

Pros
- Floating timber floors in the rooms are  noisy- you can hear people walking in them at all hours.
- lots of Good restaurants in the surrounding streets
- Close to attractions. Less than 2km to Coleseum, Trevi Fountain less than 1 km walk. 
- Beautiful lobby
- has a rooftop bar with a great view of Rome. It is Expensive though (and my husband overheard hostess ask The barman “what did he order”, we assume to ensure he was paying for the real estate space?). 
- Michelin restaurant if that’s your thing

Cons (my reason for down rating the hotel)
- Key machine to make door keys was not working on day of arrival. Had to wait for porter each time to get into room (4 times on first day).  It was quite Inconvenient. The hotel could have offered free drink for the inconvenience but did not 
- Noisy -old hotel but no soundproofing. Even with earplugs I could hear constant high heels from restaurant above until very late at night, I could hear people in hallway, and we had a connecting room and we could hear a full conversation in room next door. 

Husband would stay again, but I only would if we had a great deal",3,2018,06,04

Spacious (by European standards) well appointed room, hotel location is central and provides easy access to the many wonders of Rome.  The complementary breakfast was bountiful, and the staff very helpful.  They have a roof-top restaurant on the 8th storey that gives a great view of the city.  One fly in the ointment is that our local friends were not allowed to drive up to the hotel to pick us up or drop us off, although taxis and limos could, apparently due to police restrictions on traffic.

01,Old World Ambience in a Bustling City,"The hotel is in a great location, near Via Veneto and other good restaurants/shopping,  The rooms were large and decorated in the Renaissance style. I like hotels that reflect the environment and that still have current amenities. The bathroom was large and had all the necessary items that travelers like.Our room faced the square but was not at all noisy.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. A shout out to Pamela and Allessandra for their customer service. Breakfast was very comprehensive and delicious. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,29

01,Roma with view,Nice stay into traditional small luxury five stars hotel placed at Bernini square. Roof top restaurant with beautiful panoramic view on the city. Professional welcoming and smiling staff. Breakfast with a wide choise of fresh products.,5,2018,04,20
01,Sub par all around,"I'll start with the service.   There was virtually no service.   Very rarely did anyone greet us coming or going.  I can only recall once actually.  Check in and check out was essentially the only time anyone spoke to us.   During check in no one offered to take our bags or give us any information about the hotel other than to tell us our breakfast was not included. 

In a three night stay the door men opened the door for us twice. That was coming and going multiple times a day.   The day we left no one helped us with the taxi or our bags. 

The furniture is beat up and worn out, even in the lobby.   Our room was spacious but I'm assuming that was because we somehow got a handicap room.   The tub/shower was only enclosed partially by a small plastic door that didn't go half the length of the tub.  The maid did replace most of the towels not the obviously dirty ones (with make up etc) which was strange.   But on the whole I would not call it the best cleaning job.   

It was fairly well located which is about the best thing I can say for this property.   ",2,2018,04,19
01,Beautiful hotel!,"Rome was the last stop of a 10 day trip and the Bernini Bristol was a great hotel to stay at for our last few days in Italy. The location is perfect and the hotel is beautiful. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Every staff member (from the bellmen, front desk staff, concierge, housekeeping, dining staff) was friendly and always willing to help. The manager even went out of his way to greet us and welcome us to the hotel. We had a wonderful stay and would absolutely go back there when we visit Rome again.",5,2018,04,18

01,Value for money and very friendly staff,We stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is lovely and the staff is very helpful. The suite was very big and well maintained. Housekeeping very good. The bar has a very nice view and the location is really in the center. We will come next year again! ,5,2018,04,18
01,"Great location, professional staff, tired rooms, mediocre breakfast.","I stayed at the Bernini last weekend on a vacation trip through the LHR collection. It's in a super convenient location in the tourist heart of Rome. The hotel was convenient to approach by car (though I recommend against having a car in cramped, crowded, walkable European cities). The staff was super friendly and helpful to us and also seemed to react to other guests in comfortable ways. Our room was a bit disappointing, functional but a bit spare and needing a refresh. The view was also pretty urban and disappointing  - though I know other rooms have a view of the square and fountain in front of the hotel. Finally, the breakfast room lets all guests share the nice piazza view, tho the breakfast food was a little limited. One surprise about the breakfast room was the US-midwestern style DIY waffle maker - that was actually the highlight of the meal for me. Overall, a pleasant stay, but I will certainly try another property in Rome on my next trip.",4,2018,04,18
01,Terrible stay never again,"Huge lack of maintenance in thiss 5stars hotel downtown Rome where floors and carpets are terribly dirty, furniture has not been changed for decades and breakfasts are served in an extremely sad location where sweets are frozen and prepared in microwave (not what you want visiting Italy). No way I would suggest the place.",1,2018,04,18
01,Nice hotel located in a convenient area of a very dirty city.,"This is a 200 year plus building with years of upgrades to make it current.  Hotel is superior.  Service, staff, amenities all superior.  Located close to metro line.  30 miles or so from FCO (Rome) airport.  Great buffet breakfast.  Unfortunately, had only one night so can’t comment on any other hotel amenities.",4,2018,04,16
01,Expensive Hotel in Great Location and No More!,"We had a business conference at the Hotel.
I got terrible very small room (# 501). 
When working on the desk one needs to sit on your bad. There was no chair, since no place for it.
No Internet reception.
The curtain were stuck.
No working air condition, so you need to leave the window open and straggle with the not moving curtain.
No complimentary water. I paid 5.5 Euro for small bottle.

After two nights I was moved to floor 6 to much better room (#612) and was happy to find in the room nice fruit basket. I add an apple of mine to the basket and went down to the conference. To my sorrow when I return back to the room after two hours the fruit basket (including my apple) was removed from the room...:--((

Also the service in the breakfast was very slow and the food was not rich.  

So unfortunately, I can not recommend the hotel.",2,2018,04,14
01,Five Night Stay in Sina Bernini Bristol - Rome,"As an American spending the last five nights of a 2.5 week vacation in Europe, I was disappointed in this hotel.  We selected this hotel due to the location however our room faced a loud street with busses, music and people keeping us awake every night.  I knew there would not be an iron in the room but most European hotels will provide you one at the front desk.  This one said they could not due to fire code and it was a $10 euro charge for each garment ironed.  We also picked this hotel due to the fact that it had a spa with a steam room and sauna.  We did book a massage for both my husband and myself as well as a facial for both of us.  The people that greeted us every time we went down to the spa area  told us that we could only use the steam room and sauna 30 minutes before a treatment, even if we were hotel guests.  On our LAST day there we talked to a different girl, Anna, and she told us that as guests we could use the amenities of the gym, steam room and sauna any time we wanted.  We asked the people that told us otherwise and they attributed this error to  his poor English however I did hear him giving several tours in the English language.  There are many, many restaurants in this area with amazing food.  The views from the hotel restaurant were amazing but the food was more expensive and not as good as surrounding restaurants.  I would not go back to this hotel nor would I ever book again at a Sina Bernini Bristol.  ",3,2018,04,14
01,Pretty hotel and convenient location,"Beautiful hotel, rooms were a bit small.  I would not recommend the spa.  Very expensive and terrible.  Location was great. Very convenient and could walk to most things.  Rooftop restaurant and bar was very nice.",4,2018,04,13

01,Location Location Location,"As the title says, that's the best thing about the hotel. Just a few mins walk to any crucial landmark.
Downsides - miniature TV, very weak water pressure in the bath, no air conditioning (only heating) underwhelming breakfast - each day something else was simply missing from the day before (bread, eggs etc.). We were also surprised to get a bill for about 50 euros when we checked out for ",3,2018,04,12
01,Excellent!,"It was a very pleasant stay. As always the staff is very friendly. Nice rooms and excellent location. Very good breakfast and nice view Bar-Restaurant at the 8th floor! 
Main attraction and shopping facilities are reachable via short walking.
A lot of restaurant and bar choices nearby. 
Try to book a deluxe room, spacious and very clean one.
Overall a very pleasant stay and we will come back very soon. ",5,2018,04,12
01,Bernini - great locale,"Staff was very friendly, hotel was super clean, and breakfast was great. I loved the scent throughout the lobby - Aqua del Elba.
My only issue was no A/c in the room so it got very hot - even though weather outside was cool.",4,2018,04,11
01,Run down in Rome,"Don’t stay here. There are plenty of other wonderful hotels in Rome. 
When we were shown to our two suites, they had never been cleaned. There were slippers out, trash, and moldy fruit in a bowl. Once they cleaned the room and we went back in, it really wasn’t much better. Hair in the shower and a piece of tin foil covering a part of the shower. The trim work was falling apart everywhere. The transition strip to the bathroom was loose. The sheets are like sandpaper. The breakfast buffet was awful as well. 
We ended up switching hotels after the first night. To the hotels credit, they did offer to move us to a different set of suites, but only on our last night and only because our travel agent put op a fight for us. Don’t waste your time or money on this hotel. ",1,2018,04,11
01,Fantastic Location and Views,Love the location just minutes walking to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. Rooms are a little on the smaller side put perfect for us as a couple. for us the location can't be beat and the views from the roof top restaurant are incredible. they also have a look out balcony on the top floor as well that you can go out on and over look the front of the hotel. The rooms here can be hit or miss since they all seem to have different configurations. Some of the showers can be very small to where when you turn around in the shower you are either pushing the door open or turning the water off. Also enjoyed breakfast. seems to be a split between an Italian and American breakfast they try at both but don't always excel. I always left stuffed so I can't really complain and it's nice to have that breakfast option in the hotel.,4,2018,04,09
01,"great location ,  but rooms a bit old","  some of the rooms are older than  others ,  thin walls and loud  hallways  , great staff and very helpful .    recommend you really pay attention tot he location of the room ,  in one of the rooms  I could actually the neighbors toilet flush ",3,2018,04,06

01,"Sina Bernini Bristol - Rome, I Salute you!","Myself and girlfriend recently visited for a special trip which I used to propose. The hotel is set beautifully overlooking a busy plaza and quaint fountain. Five minutes walk from Trevi Fountain, fifteen minute walk to Colosseum and Ten minute walk to Spanish Steps this hotel truly is at Rome’s centre. The rooms are spacious, the lobby and corridors immaculate like something out of the movies and the staff second to none. Attentive and friendly even in the face of countless multilingual visitors. To top it off there is a Michelin chef and restaurant. If you are visiting Rome with a medium to high budget you will not regret choosing Sina Bernini. I will be back and I will use their chain elsewhere in Italy when I have saved some more! Amazing hotel.",5,2018,04,06
01,Not a 5-star hotel,"The location was great. However, compring to other 5-star hotels in our trip to Europe it was the worst. The rooms were extremely hot and the AC was not working since they were not turn the chillers yet.",3,2018,04,06
01,Not a ideal choice,We stayed at this hotel this march for 4 nights. The only good thing about this hotels was the location. The other things was not like a 5 star hotel. The roo s was very small and old. The hotel needs the basic updating. The view of our rooms was all over the wall. Totally i dont recommend this hotel at all as i experienced much better hotels in rome with same price.,2,2018,04,05
01,Experience city centre Rome the right way!,"Myself and a group of girls stayed here for two nights while the Six Nations was on and it was beautiful! This was my second trip to Rome. The interior is truly grand and Italian which added the special feeling you already receive when you are in Rome. The rooms are lovely and the bathroom was a great size and extremely clean. 
In terms of location when we arrived we were able to walk to a nearby restaurant have the most authentic lovely Italian meal in the heart of Rome (recommended by the reception). It also has a tour bus stop right outside it so perfect for picking up the bus and touring the City however you can take a leisurely stroll to the Trevi Fountain from the hotel and surrounding Café etc.
One last thing to add was the rooftop bar! We only discovered this on our last day and it is stunning, please sit up there with a coffee and just take in all of the surroundings! Perfect location to enjoy Rome the right way!",5,2018,04,05
01,My Home in Rome,Very nice hotel with great service.   Everyone is very helpful and work to make your stay wonderful.   The hotel is walking distance to all the sights and close to some very good shopping.  I do not think you could go wrong here.,5,2018,04,04

We Got to this hotel because we change hoteles,,,,My family and I could not sleep in the hotel Imperiale so we decided to change! And it was a great change!!! Clean hotel, great bathroom, excellent room, delicious beds!! A lot of space in the Rooms, we had a Room with a King bed and then a living Rooms where the staff put 2 twin beds! And the beds were so comfortable!!!
After 2 nights without getting enough sleep we finally got it at Bernini!!!
Great staff, Very good breakfast, and the location was excellent! If I return to Rome, i would stay here again!!!! Love it!",5,2018,04,04
01,Good Hotel in the Heart of Rome,"Stayed 3 nights in Sina Bernini Bristol. This is a good Hotel in the heart of Rome, quite close to Trevi Fountain, Colosseo, Pizza Venezia... Clean, Quiet and quite Friendly. Basically, they serve good breakfasts with fresh fruits and nice coffees. A tide restaurant with a nice view to Pizza Barberini.",5,2018,04,03
01,"Really Nice Hotel, Great Location with Awesome People Working There!","My wife and I spent a few nights here and we thought the hotel was gorgeous and the staff were on point and very eager to please.  The team at the desk were knowledgeable about the area and conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism.  Alessandra and Maximillon were extremely helpful in sorting out some traveling details.  My wife lost some medicine in the process of traveling and Maximillion called the pharmacy and made arrangements for the replacement. Alessandra was very helpful in handling a request for a different room and other things.  The hotel is located in a handy location on Bernini square.  Do Not hesitate, book this place.",5,2018,03,31
01,Top Hotel,"Staff hotel rooms and all other aspects of this hotel are first class, in a central location and within easy reach of all attractions, prices are quite high but you get what you pay for so for that touch of luxury then well worth the money.",5,2018,03,27
01,Comfortable/Clean,This is a very nice hotel.  Spotless when we arrived but day to day house cleaning could have been better. Bathroom had no window and had a faint but constant odor.  Other hotels we stayed at provided free bottled water as no one seems to drink tap. Very helpful concierge and staff friendly and efficient.,4,2018,03,26
01,Amaizing hotel,"A perfect hotel for a weekend vacation in Rome. Great location, amaizing view to Barbarini Piazza, good stylish breakfast. Beatiful design, clean, great service and a little bit of good italian old fashion style.",5,2018,03,14
01,Ideally placed for Rome sightseeing,"This is a classic, charming, bit old-fashioned hotel conveniently located for walking to most of the landmarks in Rome, including the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. It's ideal especially for art lovers as it's just round the corner from the Palazzo Barberini, the National Art Gallery. If you want to go a bit further, there are always taxis right outside and you;re next door to the metro.

The breakfast buffet (often included) is varied and substantial, giving you a good start to your busy day. The rooms are nicely appointed with good toiletries, free wi-fi, and robes and slippers, but there could be better electrical outlets; we've all got phones to charge these days! As a solo traveller, I didn't like the fact that there was an adjoining door in my room, so mention this at check-in if it would bother you, too..

Don't miss the view from the rooftop terrace, where some of our party enjoyed a decent cup of Earl Grey. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful, and pretty good at English when my Italian ran out. Would stay here again, and that's mainly what you want to know about a hotel.",4,2018,03,02
01,Pretty Hotel in a Great Location ,"Our family of 5 stayed here on the back side of our cruise vacation for several nights in 2 adjoining rooms. The hotel seems to be a classic old beautiful hotel with rooms that are decently sized for Rome, we had a Queen in each and they added a roll away bed in the second room. The bathrooms are clean and although starting to be a bit dated you can still see they were once at a premier luxury level. There are robes and slippers for your use. They include a sufficient breakfast buffet to get a start on your day. The hotel is located conveniently that you really can walk to most of the landmarks in Rome and lots of dining options. Catch the sunset from the roof or a few other great spots, it’s beautiful. The staff was attentive and polite. I wouldn’t hesitate to come back when in Rome and would confidently recommend to others.

01,"Nice, clean and friendly","The hotel is very nice and clean. Location is ideally with the subway just next to the hotel. Staff is quite friendly and supportive. Unfortunate since I have some back problems the bed was not good for me, but I solved it back stacking 2 matrasses on top of each other.",4,2018,02,23
01,Excellent,It is a very nivel hotel with a wonderful location. People al the front desk and at the door are extremely kind. Love it and I recomend It For all sorts if trips!!!! It is near all the interesting points of the city,5,2018,02,14
01,you choose: fin du siecle or contemporary interior,"we choosr bernini bristol in rome for a second time.. ok il portiere fa tutto.. he was busy inside the hotel.. so no welcome ceremony and luggage take over or door opening.. i pushed through with my two bags.. 
the desk was obviously busy with something molto importante between themselves.. i had to smile.. it was sooo italian atmosphere))). 
anyway la mia compagna was already there.. in a luxurious light bordeaux styled junior suite.. high walls with silk tapestry, furniture fin de siecle.. soft lit lamps.. we felt roman history... 
but we had a small window facing a near facade.. pretty dark .. we werent in this mood coming from the dark north.. and we got readily an upgrade to a full suite on the 7 th floor with view to the piazza and st. peters cathedral! style: contemporary italian lusso!
first dinner was at the roof top restaurant.. excellent service and great advices for the menue by the  chef waiter! 
the spa next morning for my companion was a little too basic.. the date was also been lost in the hectic of the stressed therapist.. 
but overall our stay was wonderful.. doors were opened for us at any occasion.. taxis came swiftly.. rooms were made perfectly.. breakfasts leaving without wishes.. 
so for other guests it would be important to be informed about the different room styles.. 
and with this the hotel is to be recommended seriously..",4,2018,02,13
01,Superb hotel,"Perfectly situated for a trip to Rome, the hotel was a haven of comfort with great service. Check-in was quick and efficient and all staff were courteous and attentive. If you want to feel spoiled, this is where to book! ",5,2018,02,13
01,More for the business visit nowadays,"Just spent 3 nights here following on from a 3 night trip to Florence.  Good location and friendly staff at reception particularly, helpful and informative.  However, breakfast is really poor for a 5 star.  Juice is water with a slight flavour of orange/grapefruit etc, not much selection.  Breakfast staff unprofessional, chatting amongst themselves loudly whilst customers having breakfast - i expect it was because there were only a few of us in there so they let standards drop?  The old photos of the hotel show how good it was and sadly, those days have gone.  Room mainly clean, though pillow cases were discoloured.  No tea or coffee making facilities and far too expensive for a simple bottle of water.  These hotels need to realise that if their prices were not excessive, customers would indulge themselves more.",3,2018,02,06
01,Best location in Heart of Rome city center .,"Hi there , 
We traveled to Rome from 1/1/2018 to 6/1/2018 , and it was our second time in Rome.
Hotel was very clean and deluxe , with polite stuffs , full menu in breakfast ( include ) ,top roof Bar & Restaurant with panorama view to all city and good steaks and pasta.

 But this time was different because of our  "" best location ""  in Heart of ancient area with the best access to metro station ( Barberrini station ) and so close to  famous ancient areas such as "" Spagna square "" , "" Trevi Fountain "" and ""Panteon "", ""Closseo""  ... within less than 10 minutes walking . also in most of time you can choose your style meals and Cafe & Bar .in this beautiful  square .

Have a good time in Rome ,

01,Small but not Luxury,"The hotel is part of the SLH  
Small it is but certainly not Luxury No idea how they got 5 stars Deluxe 
Location is great but that’s all
We got room110 overlooking the square Windows aren’t double glazed and you can hear every car in the street
This room got connecting door to the bathroom of room 109 and u hear your neighbor in the bathroom like he is in your room
Very unpleasant experience No privacy 
The bathroom is small the tub is very small and the door wooden frame is falling apart
Breakfast room got great view but breakfast is nothing special 
Overall hotel is a 4 stars level like Mercure or a Crown Plaza  ",3,2018,01,20
01,"Excellent service, perfect restaurant for dining","During our last travel to Rome we were staying at one of neighboring hotels and very often were choosing Sina Bernini’s Roof Restaurant for dinner.

01,Cosy stay in Rome,"[en] I would say it is a good place to stay for people in live with classic style of hotels
Ambience is obvious when you look the photos 
Rooms are pretty spacious. Bath is usual one. There is no iron in a room and no chance to get it by law. So you better prepare your clothes in advance or prepare to use iron service by 10 EUR per item.
Breakfast is pretty good

Завтрак довольно неплохой",4,2018,01,16
01,"5 Stars for Location & Staff, 3.5 Stars for Rooms","The location of this hotel cannot be beat, it is within walking distance to many of Rome's most wonderful sites.  It was so lovely to be able to take a (very pretty) walk to the Spanish Steps or Piazza del Popolo and the Borghese Gallery and/or take cabs very short distances elsewhere. The front desk, concierge, doorman are all wonderfully kind and helpful.  However as several others have stated, the rooms and particularly the bathrooms really do need an upgrade to be considered luxury or even nice.  While one doesn't come to Rome to stay in the hotel room, we found the rooms on the second floor to be small, dark, and the bathrooms were quite tiny, old and almost shabby looking and the shower stalls were in need of some TLC.   Breakfast was fine with good coffee and pastries and decent hot options, but rather expensive (25 euro a person) if you didn't have an inclusive package. I would suggest upgrading to a better room on a higher floor or a suite if you choose this hotel.",4,2018,01,07
01,Just love this hotel. ,"This is our second stay at the hotel.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and we really enjoy the accommodations. Close to the Spanish steps, Trevi Fountain and shopping. Within walking distance of each.  May be a bit more expensive but worth it. ",5,2017,12,27
01,Great location ,"We flew from Paris and landed in Rome. A $80 cab ride took us to the hotel! The location is perfect. Nearby all the attractions, a walking distance from many reataurants and bars.  The ""delux"" hotel room was average at best. An old red carpet and drab decor greeted us as we walked in the room! We were less than impressed. There was a huge cinematography convention which apparently occupied all but our room during our staying! We could not even access the roof top restaurant since it had been reserved the entire time. They did upgrade us to a junior suite for our second night.  We were grateful but underwhelmed with the decor. The room size made it more comfortable and more cozi.  We have modern taste and appreciate openness and light color. The rooms were darker and busy.  The staff was nice and accommodating. The location was easily the best attribute to this hotel.",4,2017,12,24
01,Excellent service,Got a cold room on arrival but the amazing receptionist change it and upgraded it to a suite. A warm and excellent suite. Super happy. Central and easy to walk to everything. The beds were a bit too hard for us but the breakfast compensated,5,2017,12,08

We had sent home a package from Rome post office during our stay which had gotten lost along the way and Max from concierge was amazing with helping us get our package home safely. They could have easily gotten away with not helping follow up as it 3 months after our stay there but instead Max continued to follow up until he knew the package arrived safely.

01,I love this hotel!,"The rooms and views were amazing; the view of St. Peter's Basilica was spectacular.    The bathroom was bigger than most hotel rooms in Europe; mine had a tub and shower so I took a bubble bath one night to recover from my 30,000+ steps taken each day playing tourist.  The only complaint I had was the penthouse restaurant/bar.  The first night, I tried to have drinks out on the rooftop, and was told they only had food service out there.  The second night, I planned on having dinner on the balcony, but they said they had no service.  The weather was good, so it should have been open.",5,2017,11,04
01,"Excellent location, but tired, and no longer a leading hotel","We stayed at the Bernini Bristol as part of a cruise package. We are quite experienced Rome travelers, but had never stayed here before...and will not do so again. The entire place has a tired feeling about it. The rooms need refreshing, and need updating to reflect the needs of modern travelers (better lighting, better electronic outlets, etc), and the place seems to have become a place for busloads of tourists (of which, on this occasion, we were part of.) On the good side, the breakfast buffet was well done, and on the downside, the bar service (in the lobby and on the roof) was slow, desultory and uninterested in the customer. There are SO many better hotels in Rome....why sta here unless, as we were, it was part of your cruise and you needed to be there for the transfer to Civitavecchia?",3,2017,10,30
01," Nice location but can do better",Lovely hotel in a good location within walking distance to most sites. We were upgraded to a great room with an outdoor patio. There was an MIA convention that took over most of the hotel and their signs and banners were annoyingly everywhere. They even rented the entire upstairs restaurant one evening as we were told we were not welcome to even take pictures of the sunset. Breakfast buffet was unspectacular and understaffed. Concierge recommended a local restaurant that was just ok and had a $12 cover and overpriced dishes. ,3,2017,10,29
01,Centrally located classic Italian elegance at an attractive price,"Located at the top to Via del Tritone, the rooftop dining room has a commanding view of the city and the dome of St. Peter's to the southwest. The rooms are generous in size and the staff generous in spirit. To start the day the Bristol Barberini sets an elegant, generous buffet breakfast that we very much enjoyed. 

For art lovers, the Palazzo Barberini is only a few steps away, food lovers can explore the many restaurants along the via side streets and shoppers can stroll to the neighborhood round the Spanish Steps for the finest shops. 

All-in-all an excellent experience, highly recommended.",5,2017,10,29
01,Don’t waste your money,This hotel is VERY expensive and definitely NOT worth the cost.  The rooms are QUITE small and the bed felt like it was a stuffed straw mattress that was SO flat and low.  Definitely NOT what we expected.  The location is great and easy to walk to places from the hotel. The complimentary breakfasts were good (not great).  We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant one night and the view is terrific and the food was ok but they push the specials on you. Dinner for 2 with only one person drinking wine was over $300 USD.  We felt quite ripped off.,2,2017,10,25
01,waste of money,"for 300euro+/night, I would defi not want to stay here again. the Hotel location is excellent, however the room is very disappointing.

except hotel location, there is really no highlight!",2,2017,10,24
01,Disappointed,"The hotel is in a good location but we were disappointed.  Upon arrival the room smelled of smoke, there was leftover food in the refrigerator from the prior guests, and the toilet did not flush.  After (3) attempts of repair they finally replaced all the parts.. Truly an inconvenience
The spa is old and needs an overhaul . After a day of walking we were disappointed that 
 the jacuzzi was out of order.
On a positive note, The breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious
For the price I would not recommend this hotel",3,2017,10,22
01,Disappointed Amenities,"I have the say the location was fantastic. Walking distance to The Spanish Steps and The Trevi Fountain. 
The room was sparsely furnished with ugly disheveled curtains and ugly furniture. 
The breakfast buffet was not up to par for a 5 star hotel.
Sat ourselves and had some scrambled eggs. The bacon and pastries were good. The coffee was very very weak and the bussers never walked around and asked if you wanted a refill.  They just bussed the tables. Sterile unwelcoming environment.
The orange juice not fresh squeezed and was a concentrate watered down. As well as the pineapple juice.
I just expected a lot more and was happy I did not waste my money in their restaurant for dinner.
Dante the concierge was friendly.

01,"Perfect location, time for a remodel.","You absolutely cannot beat the location. However, the hotel is very tired. I stayed at the Bristol about ten years ago, and it doesn't look like anything has been updated since. We were extremely disappointed in the spa (walked in, walked out). The rooms are perfect if you are not spending much time in them. The front desk staff was warm and helpful. The rooftop staff took forever to take our orders and bring our drinks. There is so much potential with this property. If you are looking for a moderate hotel in a great location, I would recommend the property. If you are expecting 5-star, you may want to look at another hotel.",3,2017,10,21
01,Great hotel for walking,"If you are going to Rome to walk the city, this is the perfect location.

01,Sina Bernini Bristol,"Hotel is in an excellent location but the rooms need updating, staff has attitude and the concierge is very rude and not helpful at all.  I am really surprise they are under the SLH group.  This is not a 5* property but could be if they train their staff better and do some renovations.",3,2017,10,17
01,Very central ,Had a lovely few days here. Great location near the Spanish steps. Beautiful hotel staff friendly. Bus stop right outside the door. Drinks were a little expensive but the views from the roof restaurant were breathtaking. ,4,2017,10,14
01,Beautiful Property,Wonderful Hotel in a perfect location to enjoy all Rome has to offer.  Highly recommended.  Quiet room on a busy street with a window overlooking everyday life in the city.  Staff was attentive and courteous.  Restaurant on roof outstanding.  Would certainly stay here again should my travels include Rome.,5,2017,10,10
01,Almost good ,"Our travel agent booked us in this hotel and we can honestly say that we have been partially satisfied.
The location is absolutely stunning, walking distance from the main Roman attractions, but the hotel is a little tired.
The room we had was a little “dusty” although spacious.
The staff is mostly kind and professional, but sometimes not really “warm and welcoming”. It seems they have always too much to do.
Breakfast with a good standard.

01,A Roman Holiday,"My husband, son and I just spent 5 nights at the Bernini Bristol Hotel.  This is a lovely building with an attentive, courteous and accommodating staff.  From our first day to our last, every interaction was polite and helpful.  It is located just blocks from the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain.  There are excellent restaurants in walking distance as well.  A delicious full breakfast is included.  The rooftop restaurant/bar has a beautiful view of the city, a great spot for a glass of wine after a day of touring.  Several tour buses stop across the street and there are always taxis parked outside.
Our adjoining rooms were comfortable and decorated in the classic style.  The bathrooms were modern and clean.  Air conditioning was comfortable and quiet.  I recently stayed at a B&B in Connecticut where we were treated rudely by the owner.  How refreshing to be warmly greeted by the staff throughout the day.  It is bright, clean and well maintained.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,28
01,Nice hotel in Rome center. ,Great location. Very large rooms and bathrooms. Staff not overly friendly though. Housekeeping timely. Room can be noisy but think that is just Rome!  Near the park and loved our morning runs there. Felt very safe. Breakfast lovely. Rooftop with great views and restaurant is Michelin rated.  Overall nice stay. ,4,2017,09,23
01,Worse Hotel in History!!!,"The cealing title fetl on my head at 1:30am and almost knocked me down. Apparently there have been a leak who knows since went, but looking at the walls it looked like it has always happend. They were not very nice about it and refuse to remove my charges. To think they prortratied as a 5 stars hotel, it is amazingly embarrasing to find out they are below than a 3 starts hotel.",1,2017,09,14
01,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,"It's conveniently located and within a short walking distance to most of the Rome landmarks and shopping. 
The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms are clean and spacious. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms nicely maintained. 
The included breakfast was the major shortfall. Plentiful but of less than expected quality. 
The orange juice is watery and there's one self-serve waffle iron for dozens of diners ... people stand in line to get one ... they could do better here. ",4,2017,09,14
01,"Style, class and friendly","My family and I stayed at the Sina Bernini in August. What a wonderful boutique hotel, excellent position, easy access to all the main tourist attractions in Rome. Very friendly staff, clean rooms, a fantastic view of the city of Rome from the 8th floor.
I would highly recommend.",5,2017,09,07
01,Unexpected,"I reserved this property a little concerned about few bad review. 
Honestly even if the property need refurbishment regarding the room I found a very helpful staff and a high quality service.

Restaurant good, I would preferred something traditional but was fine.",5,2017,09,02
01,"Great team, great Location","I stayed on July in this property.
I received an upgrade at the arrival and I was greeted with a warm welcome from the staff.
The location is close to everything. Staff at reception and concierge are superb.
Try the roof bar has a very nice view of Rome.
I would reccomend for the location and the kindness of the staff.",5,2017,08,27
01,Good location. Room clean but VERY hot and service average to poor,"Stayed in a suite at this hotel.  The checkin with Alessandra was great.  We found the room to be spacious and clean.  However, the A/C is clearly old and outdated and truly did not get the temperature down very much at all.  We were forced to keep the blackout blinds closed the entire time just to make the room somewhat inhabitable.  The concierge service was not good.  We were asking about skip the line access to the Vatican and he indicated that he knew a tour company that could get us a good deal.  A day later he came back with a suggestion that we pay Euro 570 for a semiprivate tour for our family of 2 adults and 2 children and that this was all that was available.  In 10 minutes on the internet, I found Maya Tours where we booked the exact same tour for Euro 200 and it was incredible (separate review).  Point is that the concierge was either incompetent or taking advantage of us as tourists; neither a particularly good outcome.  Finally, while the rooftop bar sounds great, they have it stuffed in the back with hide sidewalls and absolutely no view.  Terrible waste of space as the rooftop restaurant which had great views was almost completely unused the entire time but they do not allow you to sit there unless you are eating a meal.  I find it hard to justify going back given the price (540 Eur per night) and given all the shortcomings.  I would not recommend.",3,2017,08,23
01,Expected better,"Centrally located in Rome this hotel offers a degree of convenience. Although there are good features, it has a number of faults. Rooms have been up graded relatively recently but the ceiling services panel just inside the door is out of date and detracts from the rest of the room. TV sets were not changed and are well out of date. Reception on some TV channels comes complete with ""snow"" and the channel list in the room is inaccurate.  The Internet connection was extremely slow.

Reception staff were smart but some staff wear ill- fitting and rather tired uniforms.

The ground floor needs some refurbishing as does the 8th floor bar area.
This hotel seems to have an attitude about itself that it doesn't live up to. If you desire a 5 star hotel give it a miss, at best it is a 4 star.  Earliest check in time is 2 pm, when we checked in at 3.30 pm we had to wait half an hour for the room to be available.

Worth going to the 8th floor bar just for the night time view over Rome.",3,2017,08,15
01,"Centrally located, OK service","The hotel is centrally located in Rome with most of the attractions within walking distance. I am sure there are many hotels with equally great location. Though it is right by Barberini metro station, so more easily accessible. The reception is quite small. The rooms are not too big. Rooftop restaurant is pricey and food nothing great. Breakfast at the hotel is just adequate. Easy availability of taxis outside the hotel. Rooms are OK. Nothing great. Considering how hot it was in Rome this summer, a swimming pool would have been a great addition (not just a private pool for the presidential suite).",3,2017,08,14
01,Good base camp for Rome,"We were in Rome as a family for our first trip to the city. We were very pleased with our choice.

The good: The location of the hotel was excellent -- it was very easy to reach all the sights we wanted to by walking, taxi, or metro -- and the neighborhood is near a number of other upscale hotels and cafes. The service was also great -- all the staff at the hotel were phenomenal and went out of their way to help us. The view from our rooms was also stunning -- facing directly over the Piazza Barberini from a high floor.

The so-so: The rooms were a mixed bag. The size of the rooms themselves were very good; we didn't feel cramped at all. However, the decor and finishes could use a revamp (particularly in the bathrooms). Also, the air conditioning struggled to keep our room cool (though part of this could likely be attributed to a combination of visiting in August and Rome experiencing record heat that week...). 

Overall, we were pleased with our choice and have no qualms recommending this hotel.",4,2017,08,13
01,Simply stunning view of Rome from the rooftop restaurant!,"The restaurant had been recommended to me by my brother from when he stayed at the hotel with his family. I booked a table before leaving the UK. The staff were waiting to greet us when we arrived at the restaurant lift (we asked the hotel doorman for directions and he was able to point us in the right direction). The decor is interesting and the view over Rome is stunning even more so when the sun goes down and you can see The Dome lit up.
We enjoyed our a la carte choices and especially the tasting items they brought us to try.
Service was good. We were there for an early evening meal and we enjoyed some privacy with our meal which was especially nice.
It isn't a cheap restaurant but the interesting menu is worth trying.
There is an official taxi rank close by if you need to go somewhere after eating but we took a short walk to visit the Trevi Fountain after dark. It was only about 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2017,08,11
01,Rooftop bar lacking,Bar does not provide any views of Rome.  Asked the manager if we could sit at a table with a view and order drinks and desserts. The restaurant and bar were nearly empty with only 2 tables occupied and they told us NO!!  They don't seem to want to make a hotel guest happy. I would not recommend!!!,2,2017,08,07
01,Average rooftop bar,Good atmosphere and all that but the views from the rooftop bar were obscured by high walls and awkward seating so there wasn't much to see. Could have been anywhere really. Expensive too. The restaurant however does have great views.,3,2017,08,03
01,Not what it looks like ,"The hotel has a phenomenal potential, although it has not been refurbished from many years, if not partially. This is the typical example of an Italian hotel who has inherited its stars in the past and maintains them regardless of not being at par any longer. Only positive note, the roof terrace with a presumed quality offer, but in my opinion it seemed more a tourist venue than anything else. In other words, not my first choice. ",2,2017,08,03
01,Disappointed with most services and decor is OUT DATED,"This hotel described itself as having any connecting rooms but alas they couldn't have our group of 2 families on same floor or connected rooms.

Air conditioning is weak. Housekeeping is very messy. A pillow case was left in my suitcase. Another room had USED pantyliners dropped at the door!!!!!

Worst gripe is the guys at concierge. Only 1 out of 3 we encountered was helpful or polite. Their English is very poor for a hotel or this standard. Basically all we saw was bad attitude.

Location isn't that great, a walk to Piazza Spagna is about 10 mins but be aware coming back involves some uphill.

This hotels is definitely NOT a place I would stay again.",2,2017,07,28
01,Not a 5 star,"The bad:

For the price, the rooms were not in good shape.  The door handle in the bathroom was held on by a screw.  The curtains did not close all of the way and let the sun in in the morning, and the exterior lights didn't shut off until almost morning.  

The room was poorly cleaned daily. For instance, we stayed for 4 nights, and left our drink glasses on top of the tv cabinet along with an empty water bottle and some wrappers. They remained there the entire time.  

The AC was very weak, and the hallway was noisy. 

The good:

The staff, concierge and management really tried hard to give good service during our stay.  Always pleasant and helpful. Always ready to offer suggestions. If they felt they got something wrong, they bent over backwards to try to correct it.  

Beautiful lobby. ",3,2017,07,21
01,Well located hotel with good facilities.,Rome in April was already crowded with tourists; staying at the Bernini Bristol ensured that we were close to many places of interest and far enough away from huge crowds. It was also close to many restaurants and specialty food shops in the vicinity of Piazza Barbarini. The staff spoke good English and quickly checked us in. Our room on the 5th floor had plenty of space and was well appointed. The access to WiFi was excellent. We found the lifts struggled to cope with the busy traffic flow in the hotel and breakfast was lacking in the cooked section. We found this to be a common thread in many of the Hotels where we stayed in Italy. They like their sweets pastries and cakes. Overall we can recommend the Hotel as a convenient place to stay when in Rome and seems to fit more into a good 4 Star rating.,4,2017,07,17
01,Okay hotel; definitely not the 5-star it claims to be,"Sina Bernini Bristol was an alright hotel, but I wouldn't classify it as luxury or high-end.  The common spaces are nice and accommodating; nice materials, lighting, etc.  The front door and front desk staff were very cordial and courteous.  Location is okay. 
 Morning breakfast was good enough.  The eggs, omelets, and breakfast meats were pretty awful.  However they had a good fruit, yogurt, pasty and cereal spread.

My main complaint was our room on the 6th floor (605 or 607, I can't remember).  The carpet was well worn, a lounge chair in the room had a cigarette burn hole on the seating fabric.  The shower was VERY small and oddly enough did not have a glass or curtain enclosure, leading to wet floors after taking a shower.

Also, when my wife an I visited Rome the temperature hovered around 85-90 degrees F most days.  While I understand that A/C systems were under extra load, our room offered NO air conditioning.  We called downstairs 5 times, a facilities member came up and reset the room breaker panel.  For all 3 nights of our stay our air vent was pushing out HOT air, not even room-temperature.  The downstairs desk did provide us a fan, but did not offer to relocate to a room with functioning air conditioning.

Free WiFi is available for every room but our 4 devices (two iPhones, one iPad, and a HP laptop) had very weak, unusable connection strength from the bed and the desk.",3,2017,07,13
01,Magnificent place to stay,"We arrived here after a train trip from Venice.
Much to our delight we were upgraded, to a suite!
Very attentive staff, from booking in to the bar staff nothing is a bother.
Absolutely the nicest bar staff and concergie desk ever. 
We had a room with a front patio to view all of Rome.
Can't wait to visit hotel again!",5,2017,07,13
01,If you have the choice - stay somewhere else!,"How this hotel was ever awarded 5 stars is beyond me, I have stayed in better 3 star establishments. This was a one night stay at the end of a holiday and I assume that guests like us are slung in the rubbish rooms, as per other reviews. The only up side was the buffet breakfast which was acceptable. A few pointers for the management to think about 1) Thread bare chair in the room, 2) No complementary water. they charge 5.5 euros for a small bottle, which you can get across the road for 1.20, 3) Toilet seat loose, 4) Wash basin surround and bathroom floor stained and not properly cleaned, 5) Mould around shower tiling, 6) Room lighting difficult to turn on/off, 7) Noisy Air Con, 8) Continental breakfast 26.40 euros, American breakfast 36.30, 9) Drinks prices in the bar are extortionate to put it mildly, G&T and brandy around 30 euros!",2,2017,07,12
01,NOT a 5 star hotel,"This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. Our major complaint was that our room was back by the maid's cleaning quarters.  Behind a very large metal fire door (with an exit sign over it), separated from all the other guest rooms on the floor.  The maid's cleaning carts were outside our room, etc.  You can imagine it didn't make for a very nice experience. We stayed for 3 nights. When we first arrived, the large metal door was kept open. We didn't love the situation, but we dealt with it. After the first night, the mechanism to keep the door open broke, and the large metal door stayed closed.  This meant we were separated from all the other rooms on the floor and felt very isolated. We didn't feel safe, either from a personal security standpoint, or the idea of our room getting robbed when we were out during the day. Simply put, no one coming or going on the floor would be able to see our room, since it was stuck back behind this large metal door.  Also -- and just as bad -- this meant that every time the maids when in and out of this door, it slammed behind them.  So trying to sleep early in the morning, or rest in the afternoon, was impossible. With the constant slamming.I complained to the front desk about this and told them everything I just said.  They told me they would fix it and it was never fixed. Honestly, a hotel that claims to be this caliber should NEVER have put a guest room back here to begin with.  And if they do need to place guests here, they should offer a rate discount.  And if there is a problem like this, it should be a high priority for management to fix (at least prop the door open). Other smaller things -- there was hardly ever a doorman at the front door to open it for guests; the front desk was not able to make change like most better hotels do; the bartender in the rooftop bar was very snobby, like he was doing us a favor getting us 2 sodas and then never coming back to our table (at 6pm when the bar was empty)",2,2017,07,03
01,One Night in Rome,Our stay in Rome at the Bernini Bristol was at the end of our vacation in Italy for one night before flying home the next day. The hotel was comfortable and very quiet considering how busy the piazza below is both day and night. Our room was clean and quite comfortable. We had a drink at the rooftop bar which on that evening was covered up due to high winds. While it was a nice location to grab a cocktail the service was not up to par with other hotel bars we visited on this trip.,4,2017,07,03
01,Five stars is four too many,"When a hotel claims ""5 Star/Deluxe Status,"" I suppose that I have certain expectations. Those expectations were definitely not met at the Bernini Bristol Hotel. For someone who is not typically snarky:  here goes!  The furniture in the rooms was IKEA grade/particle board. The closet was so cheaply built that the shelves kept collapsing. The air conditioning did not work. The shower was the epitome of bad design: thanks to the lack of a shower curtain or door, you couldn't help but flood the floor every time (as evidenced by the rotting door), or bash your knees into the poorly placed tub faucet. The rooftop restaurant claims Michelin Star status. I cannot believe that. The service was terrible all around. (The surly bartender refuses to acknowledge you for several minutes, even when you are sitting directly in front of him -- then he just can't seem to make a simple vodka on the rocks with a twist of lemon (a twist is most definitely not a half of a lemon thrown into the glass). The wine service was inept (sorry huffy wine steward, but I don't think it is outrageous to ask for a new glass when switching from champagne to red wine). Having said all that, the hotel is well located (within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon, etc.), the view from the rooftop terrace is breathtaking, and the Concierge service was helpful with making multiple  restaurant reservations. ",2,2017,06,25
01,Wonderful Gem in Rome,"Wow! What a perfect hotel in a great location. Very easy walking distance to so many sites! Hotel very clean, staff so very helpful and trustworthy. I was so impressed after flying all night, staff very helpful with luggage, gave us espresso and just helped us to relax. Concierge was so gracious to guide us in the best direction to start to see the sites of Rome. Breakfast was always so very delicious. Our beds were turned back each night and our rooms kept immaculate. Front desk staff so very kind.  I loved our stay in Rome. It was very special!",5,2017,06,22
01,Lovely staff and best location for exploring Rome,"This was my first time in Rome and I stayed for 5 nights prior to a cruise and loved this hotel. The staff were fabulous, the roof-top restaurant (Michelin 1-star) was sensational, the breakfast was plentiful and never crowded and my room was quiet and beautifully maintained. And literally next door to the hotel was a Metro station, a bus stop, a Hop-on-Hop-off bus stop for at least 2 or 3 of the HOHO bus lines and there was a taxi rank at the front of the hotel. The Metro and buses are super easy to use, and Google maps will tell you how to get everywhere in Rome by public transport, or you can just walk. Won't stay anywhere else on my next trip to Rome. ",5,2017,06,21
01,Great hotel in the heart of Rome.,"We spent 2 nights here as part of an Italy tour and we loved it here.   The room was beautiful, so elegantly decorated.  And it was so quiet given it's central location.  We heard nothing and were right by the elevator too.  The staff was so pleasant and they even opened for breakfast early for our group so we could eat before our day tours.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.   The location was great, within walking distance of the Spanish Steps, shopping and the Trevi Fountain.  Really liked it here.",5,2017,06,17
01,Superb service and wonderful rooftop dining,"Stayed here in May en route to the countryside for a week in Umbria. Staff and service are both excellent - really great. The room was fine - nothing special and definitely not as impressive as my friends' suite which was stunning. Recommend spending the extra money if you can. Ask for a room with a view of the Piazza Barberini. 

The rooftop restaurant is stunning....get a table on the terrace and then get the tasting menu - superb, truly superb.  One final note, though - I was surprised to find out non of your front of house staff have tried the food upstairs - to the manager; you should take them all for dinner in your fabulous restaurant! At the very least it will help them sell more bookings!

I'll be back - thanks guys.",5,2017,06,12
01,Great location but extremely noisy rooms.,"The positives
This hotel is in a great location in Rome,  walking distance to shopping and most sights.  The rooms were modern and clean.  The staff were professional. The hotel decor looked great. The breakfast buffet had a good range of foods.

The negatives
The drinks were extremely overpriced . It was a 5 star hotel with 10 star basic beer prices. The room we stayed in on the first floor was extremely noisy and not just from the outside traffic but from the other rooms.  When the occupants beside us did their morning business went to the toilet or talked or moved around in any way it sounded like they were right beside us in the room in bed with us. Not pleasant .  You could hear people talking even down the end of the corridors like they we in your room.  It was like the walls were made of paper. I expect to hear traffic it's just a part of it but I'm not keen on hearing people be sick or sitting on the toilet when I'm laying in bed.  There are some sounds you just don't want to hear.  ",2,2017,06,11
01,OK stay,"This hotel was fine but I think overpriced for what it is. The rooms were like all other rooms in 5 star hotels, nothing unique or special. Pluses are the hop on, hop off bus is just opposite and it's near the 'new' parts of Rome ie Spanish Steps, and the terrace bar with a lovely view over Rome. Minuses were being far from the 'old' and, to my mind, the more interesting and vibrant part of Rome with interesting small cafes and restaurants. Another minus was that some of the staff were very indifferent. Some people like the predictable 5 star experience, but next time I go to Rome I will stay in a smaller hotel that has a more personal approach.",3,2017,06,04
01,Great Hotel in Rome,"This was perfect for us. The hotel staff were very helpful, room was excellent, breakfast each morning was outstanding and the location was the best.  We were right across the street from the Hop on Hop Off bus system which worked well.  Also walking distance to many restaurants. Taxis readily available day and night at the hotel.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Rome.",5,2017,06,01
01,Excellent location easy walking distance of all major Rome attractions.,"Really good sized comfortable room decorated in slightly faded glamour style and very elegant (although our friends had room on other floor which was very modern) - we had one of the rooms on Floor 2 with terrace which was a bonus.   Very comfy beds.
Breakfast served in a lovely first floor room - lots variety, cheeses, meats, fruit and pastries and also eggs etc. - all good but ensure you book bed & breakfast as if not included was a bit expensive.
Lovely rooftop restaurant and bar - great place to sit and drink a cocktail.
We found all the staff to be very pleasant,  helpful and courteous - in short - it is a great place to stay.",4,2017,05,31
01,Okay stay,"Except for a few disappointments e.g. Concierge recommended restaurant to pricey and bad food, housekeeping could not find the scarf , selfie stick and power bank it was an ok stay. Walking distance to most tourist spots. Great view of Piazza Barberinni, good breakfast choices and helpful friendly staff. I would stay here again but be careful not to leave anything behind.",4,2017,05,26
01,Oh so central,"The hotel is very well located. Right at the start of the Via Venito, a short walk to the Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps. Best of all, the Hop on hop off buses stop at it's doorstep.
Very good restaurants all around.
The hotel is well maintained and the staff very courteous.
Price competitive too",4,2017,05,18
01,"Excellent location, service, and amenities",I recently stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during my first visit to Rome.  I was pleasantly surprised by everything about this hotel.  I was warmly greeted and helped by the front desk.  All of the people I encountered during my stay were super friendly and helpful.  The included breakfast was very good - fresh food and an array of choices and I love the view from the breakfast room.  The gym is small but equipped well enough to meet all of your needs. My room was on the 5th floor and had a balcony and I absolutely loved it!  The view out onto plaza Barberini was awesome!  And my room was kept very clean.  The welcome cookies were a nice touch.  The bathroom was spacious and beautiful and my bed was comfortable.  You can't beat the location of this hotel - walking distance to so many great places and restaurants and shops.  I also appreciated that it was quiet at night for sleeping.  Hotel Bernini for the win!,5,2017,05,17
01,Beautiful Bernini,"Just stayed here for 5 days and found the hotel to be very pleasant. The front desk is friendly and helpful, but depending on the person who is attending.  Service:  The wait staff, bar tenders are very efficient and friendly.  The upstairs bar/restaurant is very nice, beautiful views from the rooftop and they offer snacks along with your beverage. The concierge(s) were a little brusk, not helpful at all.  Rooms:  The rooms were a little worn as others mentioned, we were upgraded to a suite (two bathrooms was a treat - we each had our own) but the room furnishings, walls, closets are shown wear and tear and doesn't seem to match the lobby and the price tag.  Location:  excellent location, Spanish steps, Trevi all short distance, Gardens, hop on/off bus stops right outside of hotel door, great restaurants, gelato, outdoor cafes one minute away.  All said, we would stay here again as the breakfast offering is excellent and although a bit worn rooms - it is clean, friendly and spacious hotel.",4,2017,05,17
01,"Good location, needs work.","It was nice being able to easily open the window.
The front desk could have been more helpful and gracious.
The room needs updating. It's rather tired. The drawers don't slide easily. Like a number of other hotels in Italy, the bathtub has a pull cord, but no grab bar. 
The upstairs bar was noisy and did not have a good selection of small plates.",3,2017,05,10
01,Engagement,"My wife and I went here in 2012. I proposed on their rooftop restaurant at sunset. The staff was super friendly and more than helpful arranging a photographer for me to capture the moment. However, we didn't receive a special room or upgrade for this special occasion. But, it wasn't a requirement of them. The bed was very uncomfortable and the wifi wasn't very good either. Aside from those minor details the hotel was impeccable! GREAT location too!!",4,2017,05,09
01,Outstanding Hotel,"Great location, excellent service, complimentary breakfast exceeds expectations by a mile. Spring for a deluxe room with a view (502) and enjoy a glass of wine on the balcony. One of the finest hotels we've stayed in and would definitely return. ",5,2017,05,05
01,"beautiful, charming hotel, centrally located","The Sina Bernini Bristol is located at the Piazza Barberini, so it's very centrally located, within walking distance you find many landmarks such as the Spanish Steps, and superb restaurants and coffeeshops. The view form the rooftop restaurant is stunning, and we got instantly smitten with the charms of the eternal city by night. I'd highly  recommend an espresso doppio at the rooftop restaurant watching the ever changing atmosphere of the city at all times of the day!",5,2017,05,03
01,"Classy and elegant, with superb staff","This centrally located hotel is within walking distance of all Rome's major attractions and the superb concierge staff will be pleased to direct you to them.
We enjoyed two beautifully decorated and spacious rooms, decent wifi and the best buffet breakfast imaginable - at least 6 different types of milk (try the coconut milk with your cereal) and 2 different flavoured waters (the aloe water was lovely) and the tomatoes with toast or omelette - yum yum!
You will love this hotel",5,2017,05,02

The location is perfect, our room (suite on the first floor) was beautiful with a large bathroom and great view of the plaza and fountain. We had lots of room.

01,Most convenient,"i stayed at the Bernini for 10 consecutive days as tour manager for an American group.  My clients as well as mI were most satisfied. The location is absolutely perfect, whether in a group or on your own. Most important sights are in walking distance, there is a subway station right next door and the Hop-on-Hop-off bus stop is across the street. Besides Piazza Barberini is a sight by itself and there are many good small restaurants all around. I hope to be back.",5,2017,04,26
01,Almost five stars,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights just before Easter to celebrate my birthday. We had booked our 5 day long city break in Rome with British Airways Holidays and got a really good deal on the Bernini Bristol hotel. The location is absolutely wonderful and we were able to walk everywhere even all the way to Trastevere. 

Our check-in was swift and a staff member took us to our room on the 3rd floor and explained about all available facilities and times for breakfast. The room didn't have a balcony and wasn't facing Piazza Barberini but was fairly cosy. The wallpaper seemed slightly peeled off in one or two places and the skirting boards were chipped here and there not fully giving it the 5 star look and feel. The shower was great and the towels spotlessly white. The bathrobes and slippers were also a nice touch. 

The breakfast room is spacious and the selection of food and beverages pretty much OK. The cheese section rather boring and I never saw any fresh tomatoes available. Very friendly staff and happy to help. One morning I asked for peppermint tea instead of coffee and got a pot of fresh mint tea which was a lovely surprise.
We also visited the bar upstairs and ordered two cocktails. I actually didn't like mine. We took the drinks outside and sat on the terrace to watch the sunset. 

I was very disappointed the hotel didn't acknowledge my birthday with a birthday card or even a tiny box of chocolates. And I mentioned it at our check out. Well the sign in the reception says: ""Don't stay. Experience"". Apparently they ordered a cake and tried to deliver but it just ended up somewhere else. I accepted the apology with a smile.
So will I be tempted to stay here again? Definitely. A few minor hiccups didn't spoil our stay. And we loved the location and the neighbourhood.

Tip: there are two grocery shops just round the corner (turn left when you come out and cross the road) so you can buy mineral water and anything else.

01,"Great staff, great stay","We recently left Hotel Bernini and had a wonderful stay. We were recommended by a travel agent and couldn't have been more pleased. The rooms are small in a typical European fashion, but tastefully done. The bathroom was a very nice size. It was clean and comfortable. The most wonderful thing about this hotel was the service. All it took was a phone call to get anything we wanted, even when we asked for 20 extra hangers. The hotel staff when we left/came back always greeted us with a genuine bonjorno/bueno suerte. They were friendly, helpful, and there was nothing they wouldn't do to please. I would recommend this hotel without reservation. It's in an excellent location, convenient to almost anything you would want in Rome. We are New Yorkers, typically hard to please, and had read some reviews on Trip Advisor that have now left us perplexed. We don't have a negative thing to say. If you get a chance to check out Tullio, a recommendation from the concierge, it was our favorite restaurant in Rome.",5,2017,04,16
01,Nice but be carefull,"I have nothing to add to what other reviewers said, the hotel is nice staff at the reception and breakfast room were very nice and helpful.

 The disappointment started when we discovered that things we bought were missing. Fist we lost kids Ferrari suit then my electric cigarette and finally while packing at checkout day, we realized that 3 new shoes were missing. The hotel manager didn't even show us his nice face he decided to let his staff handle this (he has the time to answer reviews on TripAdvisor).Finally the only solution they gave us is to go to the police while we have fly in 4 hours.

Anyhow, if you decide to stay at this hotel make sure that you secure your stuff.

Me and my family fly 4 times a year to different locations around the world and never encountered such an incident. Never lost a single bag and it took me lots of thinking before I called the reception to report that things are stollen.",2,2017,04,14
01,"Good hotel, but not 5*","Stayed at the Bernini for 4 nights, used as a base for visiting the sights of Rome.
The hotel is well positioned at the top of the hill , overlooking the Triton fountain, which sadly, was being repaired, so not much to look at.
Within-easy walking distance of the Trevi fountain and Spanish  steps, amongst the many other sights on the way.
The hotel, yes, its nice, all marble and staff in uniforms opening the doors for you, polished wood and plush upholstery throughout, however, when you get to the rooms, although ok, it doesn't reflect the opulence of the the rest of the hotel.
Good comfy beds, very little space to put anything, wardrobe space is not brilliant, but there again, if yours only doing a couple of nights, it's adequate.
Rooms are cleaned every day, nice touch with dressing gowns and slippers. There is a mini bar, but the prices are eye-watering, as is the rest of the hotel.
We visited the rooftop bar with fantastic views, but a small glass of beer or wine will cost you a tenner a piece.
If you're going on a budget, expect to be shocked by the prices, the cheapest house wine in a corner cafe is €4, expect to pay around €7 + in a restaurant.
A two course meal for two  in a local restaurant with wine will cost you upwards of €80 + , thats a reasonable cost , given some of the restaurants will be double that, especially if you dine in the hotel where a meal would cost around €200 + for two.
Change money to euros in the UK, the exchange rate in Rome is around 80-90 cents to the pound.",4,2017,04,06
01,Great hotel for weekend break,The hotel is ideally suited for the sights and walkable to all. The staff are charming & couldn't be more helpful. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice including Italian pastries. It is a little old fashioned but personally we liked this & it seemed more authentic. Our trip to Rome was to celebrate our anniversary and we're really pleased we chose to stay here.,5,2017,04,04
01,Mixed Reviews,"This was our first family trip to Europe. This was our third hotel stay on our journey. 

Don't be confused by first impressions at this hotel!

First impression when we arrived was WOW!!   The location is perfect, truly centrally located. Very short walk with the kids to the Spanish steps, Trevi fountain, Pantheon. Took a taxi to the Colosseum and Vatican. 

 The reception staff is wonderful, doors were always being opened for us, concierge was helpful, bellhops were efficient. 

 The breakfast buffet the first day  was very thorough, lots of fresh fruits, proteins, etc. made the whole family even our picky seven-year-old happy.  The second day, however, half of the provisions had run out, they were not being restocked, there was no water glasses I had to give my daughter her water in a champagne flute. Staff came by twice asking what I wanted to drink, I requested coffee, 20 minutes later still nothing.

Many more disappointments, and these were big ones for us. We had a no smoking room but we often could smell smoke from other rooms. On our second day, the entire hallway smelled like old fish.  The first night we came back from the Trevi fountain and our room door was left open by the maids, fortunately everything in that room was secure, the maid even came back and profusely apologized. Accidents do happen. However, the second day we came back, only one of our two rooms was cleaned.  At this point the reception staff was trying to blame us for this error, for some reason it did not feel like the customer was being respected.  The third day, the cleaning job by the maids was very subpar (see photo of bed).

 Overall the hotel is beautiful, however for a ""five-star hotel in"" you would think the showers would have shower curtains, instead the floors were soaking wet after a quick shower. There was no iron to press clothing after a long travel from United States,although this is typical for an Italian hotel. The rooms are not equipped with any coffee makers or other forms of caffeine. Our toilet  just stopped flashing one day, we had to have this fixed.  The built-in drawers and closets were pretty but they were difficult to open and close and extremely noisy. The hotel is very outdated, dirty carpets, ragged wallpaper. See attached photos.

 For the price that we paid, I would've expected a few more finishes to the rooms, and better customer service. Oh well.

 We will not be returning to this hotel, and I do not recommend it.",2,2017,04,02
01,"Great location, but expected better","I stayed the last 2 days of my trip here as my boyfriend and I were looking for something that was luxurious and also a good location. The hotel is very close to everything, alsi a quick walk to barberini metro station.The hotel was good in general however for this price, we expected a more updated room. It was very outdated, I posted a couple of pictures. Is it luxurious? Yes, the entrance is beautiful, with a nice decor, and marble floors. Is it worth the price? I definitely do not think so. 

The good: 

-Great location, close to everything, even the sightseeing bus stop
-All staff speak very well English
-Bed is comfortable 

The bad:

-Breakfast is not included (as most luxury hotels)
-rooms are outdated, need renovations
-no air conditioner ( was quite hot and we had to open the windows)
-no iron available, only laundry service ( that is everywhere in Rome)",3,2017,03,29
01,Super Business Hotel,"One of the best place I know in Rome for a short business trip or even family stay. Nice and classy restaurant, excellent choice of breakfast, hundreds of good shops and restaurants around also. The lobby bar is attractive and perfect for business meetings.",5,2017,03,26
01,Do not miss Santa Maria della Concezione!,"This church is right up the street from the hotel on the Via Veneto and features crypts below made entirely from bones of Capuchin monks.  There are many famous Roman sites nearby (Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, etc) but this is the most unique.  It was crowded even late on a January afternoon!  We stayed at the Bernini Bristol for 4 nights near the end of January.  We arrived fairly early in the morning but were able to enter our room and sit for a bit before going touring.  We were told we were upgraded to a superior room-it overlooked a side street but was very comfortable with a small sitting area and a decent sized bathroom-everything up to date if on the formal side.  The breakfast is fabulous.  This room and hotel were part of an air/hotel package that was very reasonable for the quality of the room, food, and service.

It is in the Centro Storico part of Rome and most places are within a walk (some things close, some things less so but we were seeing other sites this time having been to Rome before so cannot comment on Vatican, etc) so that we did not even need to buy a long term subway ticket but the Bernini station is right outside the hotel and Termini is one stop away.  We came by taxi from the airport (shared with some people going elsewhere) but left by subway from the Bernini station to Termini.  We were on our way to a cruise from Civitavecchia.  Warning, the train was at the opposite end of the station from where we came up from the subway.  Still travel was convenient.  
There are many good restaurants close to the hotel and short walks to some other very good places so we did not try the hotel restaurant but would had the weather been bad.  I would stay in this hotel again and recommend it to other travelers.",5,2017,03,09
01,Stunning location ,"Beautiful, well presented hotel. On arrival we were allocated a suite on the 3rd floor which was on the front of the building, needless to say our views of Rome were stunning! Lounge area was lovely & spacious, bathroom had shower & separate bath with 2 sinks. Bedroom had large king size bed. The suite was very clean. Turn down service at night too. Staff were extremely helpful and polite. We had drinks on the roof top terrace which was the reason for choosing the Bernini. Breakfast was wonderful..superb scrambled egg!! Would we stay in this hotel again yes. Would we recommend this hotel...most definitely.  Thank you to the Bernini staff for making our stay enjoyable.",5,2017,03,07
01,Superb!!!,"We Celebrated our Honeymoon at the Sina Bernini Bristol, we stayed at a room with a balcony. It was a  very enjoyable experience and had excellent breakfast service Compared to most hotels we stayed in Italy. It is in a very good side of town and is within walking distance of many places especially Trevi Fountain and the Gardens. Would definitely recommend, Marco was great help and so was the Concierge Nichola!",5,2017,03,01
01,Lovely hotel in a great position.,"The hotel is situated within 10 minutes of the Trevi fountain and the Spanish Steps, making it an excellent base for a trip to Rome.  Also there are lots of good restaurants very close.  Just as well in our case as the taxis were on strike when we arrived! It is beautifully furnished, lots of marble, etc. and the rooms are very comfortable and we had good nights. There is a bar / restaurant of the eighth floor with stunning views (but it is expensive). But what makes it special is the staff.  The consierge was particularly knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble.  All in all we had a great stay.",5,2017,02,26
01,Absolutely Fabulous,"Loved this hotel,everything from the location, to the staff, and room was wonderful. I have already recommended to several friends that will be visiting Rome soon. This will be my good to hotel when visiting Rome again.",5,2017,02,22
01,Lovely hotel,"Ideally situated in Rome to visit most of the sights on foot, and the metro is only a 100 yards away if you need it. Plenty of choices for breakfast and staff very efficient.Pleasant staff at check in, and out, although a couple of bellmen should try and crack a smile. Very helpful and pleasant doorman Stefano, say hi and thanks to him from his Scottish friends. Would recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future.",5,2017,02,07
01,Rome visit,"Central grand hotel which is next to the metro. Great lobby and friendly staff especially the lady in the gym. Gym was well equipped, also had a sauna/steam room. Within walking distance of most sites. ",5,2017,01,29
01,"Location, Roof-top Restaurant, Bernini Fountain, Trevi Fountain,more","My trans-atlantic cruise landed me in Rome at the magical Bernini Bristol hotel.  The famous Via Veneto is a road like 5th Ave in NY or Rodeo Drive in LA for high end fashion and shopping. It joins right to the circle, at the Bernini fountain, right out front of the hotel. Bernini's symbol is three bumble bees. The artist, Bernini, is known for sculpting the Main Altar at St. Peter Cathedral in Vatican City, among other wonderful pieces of art.  From the excellent Roof Top Restaurant at the hotel, you have a beautiful view of St. Peter's Cathedral, and much of Rome. We walked to the Trevi Fountain one day and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, another.  Excellent room with huge window overlooking Bernini Fountain. Large bathroom. Very professional and helpful service. I loved the location the best.",5,2017,01,23
01,"Fabulous , luxury home from home. We loved it.","We loved this hotel.!!!. The hotel is located next to Bernini Metro, which means that getting around Rome is simple. There are also buses outside. We took advantage of the 3 day all transport card for €17 , this met all our travel needs. 

The hotel is secure and very safe, the doormen and reception keep the hotel very secure and safe. Our room on the 5th floor was recently decorated and very clean. Linin, towels, soap all 5star,...the room was OCD clean, bright and lovely. We stayed 4 nights and slept very well. I took a 40 minute walk to the Vatican each morning at 7am, Fantastic. We stayed December 11-15. 

The rooftop bar , restaurant, and breakfast were superb, food as only the Italians can do. breakfast had fantastic coffee, and Prosseco, I don't drink but my wife enjoyed a glass or two with her breakfast. Waiting staff at breakfast were very professional and friendly. Staff in all restaurants were really pleasant and helpful. I really liked the staff in the hotel. 

The spa and gym were in the basement , I visited but did not use, again very friendly ..

My bill was correct, and check in and check out efficient and friendly.

This is a classy hotel, it's not cheap but offers good value. It's true 5 star, because of the service, food and amenities. We really liked the hotel and hope to return.

Thanks to all staff and management who made our stay in Rome so great.

01,A magical holiday week,"My husband and I just returned from a long Christmas trip to Rome and Hotel Bernini Bristol was immediately our home away from home. The staff was exceptional and accommodating down to the last detail. They even prepared a room extra early when my husband called from the airport to see if early check-in was possible. (Note: We did arrive a few days before the Christmas rush and the hotel may have experienced a slow patch.) There was a very nice assortment of breakfast options available every morning in the breakfast room. The restaurant and bar offered a great selection of food with an amazing view. The location was far-ish from some sights, but it was entirely manageable. It's a very short walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, a moderate walk to the Pantheon and Piazza Navona, and a beautiful long walk to the Vatican. It's a reasonable taxi ride to/from Roma Termini (and taxi is recommended because the station neighborhood isn't the best). It was a spectacular adventure and we would stay there again in a heartbeat! (Under ""Hotel Style"" Trip Advisor asks if the hotel is modern. It's very current and updated - no dingy walls or tattered furniture pieces. However, the style is Roman traditional - very lovely and elegant. Not like an IKEA.)",5,2016,12,29
01,central for the sights,"The hotel is in a very good location for all the sights.  We were in a room on the 5th floor. The 5th floor hallway was beautiful with marble flooring.  The bedroom was ok.  There were no tea making facilities and the bed was hard.  My husband was bitten by mosquitoes in the room on our last night there. We did have the window open during the day as we couldn't get the air conditioning to work. It was extremely quiet in the room all of our stay.
I didn't find the staff particularly helpful especially the more mature receptionists - the had quite a superior attitude.  I didn't find the hot tub even though we brought costumes with us. There isn't any outside space to sit at the hotel to chill out.",4,2016,11,27
01,Excellent Location,"This was booked by the tour company, but we found the hotel excellent.  Our original room did not have a bath, which we prefer, but they immediately switched us to one that did.  The staff were generally friendly and helpful and particularly the downstairs barman (I regret I did not get his name).  However the key to this hotel is its location - very close to many of the sights, and within walking distance of almost everywhere in central Rome, although being at the top of a hill, a taxi back is appreciated at the end of the day!",4,2016,11,25
01,Adjoining rooms :) but bed :(,"We enjoyed a quiet & convenient stay in November. The adjoining rooms for our family of five were a plus. Service was great and rooms were clean. My only complaint is that the beds were hard! And the master room's king was two beds pushed together causing a very uncomfortable seam. If we each stayed on our own side of the bed it was ok, but there was no comfy cuddling in the middle!! ",4,2016,11,22
01,Best location in Rome!,"The Bernini is beautiful, very scenic and picturesque.  A gorgeous boutique hotel. The hotel is so clean and pretty complete with a huge lobby and bar.  The hotel is in a perfect location, close to all of the major tourist attractions.  You can walk everywhere from the hotel.

The staff and concierge are so professional.  The concierge made restaurant reservations for us every night, either in the hotel or outside the hotel.  The gourmet restaurant on the top floor offers amazing gourmet meals with a view of the city.

The breakfast buffet is the best that I have seen.  Great variety, hot and cold items to choose from.  

The rooms are clean and pretty with gorgeous views.  The beds are very comfortable, but the pillows are small.  Everything you need in a hotel.

The spa needs upgrading.  The steam room was nice and hot but the hottub was lukewarm.

Book it, you wont be disappointed!",4,2016,11,18
01,Center of Rome,Great location in beautiful hotel. Convenient location to great shops and restaurants and tourist stops. The best part about the hotel was the rooftop bar where we could sit and have food and drinks overlooking the city skyline. Spent a wonderful three hours up there reconnecting with my husband on our wonderful getaway.   I was very relaxed and never felt like we were being rushed.   Loved the decor.  Here are some photos.,5,2016,11,08
01,Great Hotel,Excellent hotel in a great location! The hotel is located within walking distance to the major sites.  The Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain were close by along with numerous restaurants.  The staff was friendly and the room was spacious and clean.

01,"Good business hotel, but not 5 star.","Stayed here one night due to some work comittments and as a last min decision to go to Rome. The service at the hotel is top notch, they help out in every way possible.

Some of the rooms are refurbished and have nice bathrooms, but be aware that some rooms have something inbetween of a queen and Twin bed. 

Ask for a Queen or King. The bed was hard. 

Location of the hotel is perfect. Walking distance to Trevi fountain and Spanish steps.",4,2016,11,01
01,Traditional Roman Hotel,"A tradtional hotel in the center of Rome, comfortable, wonderful view towards bustling Piazza Barbarini. Here find a great bar, restaurant, well equipped rooms.

01,"Great location, great view, friendly staff","My husband chose for our anniversary and it was a great experience. Although we had requested a balcony with our room, we settled for the beautiful view from our 3rd floor room facing the Piazza. The room was a good size, but some space was slot in the hallway due to the fact it was a corner room. The renovated room was pleasant, comfortable bed, roomy bathroom and the ambiance was relaxing throughout the day and night. Situated in a busy area, there were a few good cafes and restaurants around hotel that cam in handy early morning. We had breakfast one time in the room, but we didn't enjoy the coffee nor the croissants. The staff were very helpful and prompt. I would definitely stay here during my next trip to Rome. Don't miss out on Guida Ballerino's food and view from the terrace.",4,2016,10,12
01,"Fantastic hotel, over the moon with the hotel ","We went to Rome for a romantic weekend away, we had 3 nights and had the hotel chauffeur pick us up from the airport he was 30 min early which helped as our flight was early also! When we was seated in the lovely car they was comfortable seats and bottles of water waiting, the chauffeur give us a visual tour of Rome on the way to the hotel. When we arrived we was greeted with friendly staff at reception that couldn't do enough to help you. Our room was lovely and quaint with a fantastic view of the city. We also tried the roof top restaurant which was magnificent especially  if you enjoy trying new kinds of foods. The spa was beautiful small and cozy and we had two fantastic massages. I can't express how delighted we was with this hotel and we will defiantly be staying there again in the future. ",5,2016,10,09
01,Excellent service,"After an initial hiccup on arrival, I couldn't fault the staff for the way the responded and the way we were treated. When we were initially allocated our room, we took a while to find it as we had to negotiate our way through what could best be described as a building site due to some renovations that were taking place. When we did find our room there was building work going on outside and we struggled to even get access. So we went to reception and pointed this out, aided by the porter who had tried but failed to bring up our luggage. Within a couple of minutes, the duty manager was on the scene and upgraded us to a room on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel, with a balcony.
As you can see from the photos the rooms are of a decent size and ours had all the expected amenities. Breakfast was included in our room package and was served in the airy and spacious restaurant, buffet style. There were plenty of hot and cold choices, the staff were friendly and the service very good.
If we return to Rome in future we would certainly consider staying here again.",5,2016,10,06

01,Wonderful staff and great location!,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and had an amazing time. 

The staff was ver accommodating, friendly and always looked to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We are definitely coming back. 

If you can, book one of the suites overlooking the Barberini fountain, it's a little more expensive but completely worth it. ",5,2016,09,28
01,Very enjoyable stay - great service and wonderful in-house restaurant,"We stayed in a deluxe double room in this hotel for 3 nights in September 2016.  It is brilliantly located within a stone's throw of the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and Rome's key shopping districts.

The room was very well presented, with floorboards being a very warm feature, but the decor, in our room at least, felt just a bit ""dated"", although nothing was distasteful.  Time for a bit of refurbishment perhaps?  But this is not to detract from this establishment as all the mod cons were there.  The bed was comfy, bathroom very clean and service very good.  Breakfast was very nice, offering a large assortment of hot and cold dishes, including some very enticing pastries.

The hotel itself is, in its current configuration, probably worth 4.5 stars.  But what sets this place out and earns it top rating is its two other features.  First, the staff can't be beaten.  Service was brilliant; for example, when the hairdryer blew up, it was replaced within 5 minutes (this was ""after-hours"") and when I had left my hat in the restroom, the staff had found it while we were out, somehow deduced it was mine and had put in back in our room before we came back to the hotel!

The second ""great attraction/addition"", and this can't be stressed highly enough, is the in-house Michelin starred restaurant, Giuda Ballerino!  We has the very best dinner of our lives here and would return again and again.  Everything about the meal was inspired and the service was incredible, not to mention the killer view from the 8th floor from where the dome of St Peter's can be spied.  We were treated like the Michelin inspectors. Bravo!",5,2016,09,25
01,"Compassionate, friendly service","Perfectly licated to walk to all the major tourist sites, Trevi Gountain, Spanish Steps, Colosseum, Forum, Pantheon to name a few. Quiet, comfortable rooms.

Would recommend this boutique 5* hotel.",5,2016,09,20
01,Good Location,"We had lots of trouble getting our reservations right, which might have been the travel agency's bad. However the plumbing in our room was so bad they tried to fix twice and finally after all the ordeal the kindly moved us into a suite. The staff was good and so was the location for what we where doing. Overall not a terrible experience but not 5 star.",3,2016,09,18
01,Features a rooftop restaurant with spectacular views,"This hotel is located on east side of Piazza Barberini which is in the central section of Rome.  There is a beautiful bar and restaurant (partly open air) on its eight floor that provides a wonderful view to the West.  There was little or no street noise from the Piazza and the experience of setting under the stars looking at St. Peter's is unforgettable.   There is a convenient subway stop (Line A) within 100 feet of the front door as well as a number of modest to nice restaurants.  The Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain are within easy walking distance.

The main level public spaces are well done and a fairly reasonable breakfast is served in an attractive second floor room.

We were fortunate to have Room 602 which has a really large patio (400+ sq ft?) and the same view one gets from the restaurant.  The last two nights we got take outs from one of the nearby restaurants and, with a bottle of wine, enjoyed the beautiful patio.  Doesn't get any better.",5,2016,09,12
01,Birthday Celebration,"Spectacular views over the city from the wonderfully elegant restaurant. Fantastic, attentive staff & service with food to match. I was fortunate enough to be with my Italian family celebrating a 70th birthday party and I couldn't think of a better place for it. Everything was just perfect. A romantic meal for two or a family gathering. You won't be disappointed. ",5,2016,09,10
01,should I look a gift horse in the mouth?,"The room was nice, I was unlucky that it was a room with a closed door towards the adjacent room. There was some noise from the TV in the other room, but I blocked this with a duvet, and the problem was fixed. At the reception they were very helpful when I told them I would have to leave very early and they prepared a bag with breakfast. This was a disappointment. A mini croissant, some jam, cheese, a banana. You could say that it's the idea that counts, and the intention was good of the poor people, but the result was a bit more like a 'no stars' breakfast, not exactly 'five stars'.",3,2016,09,10

01,A Roman Palace in the heart of Rome,"Unbelievable historic hotel. Luxury and spacious ambience, with medieval tapestries, paintings, frescoes and mosaics, this hotel exudes the feel of a palace in the heart of Rome. Central to everything with polite and efficient staff. The covered or open rooftop restaurant and lounges with casual bar/snack area had extensive city views. Then relax in the spa and sauna or Hamam (Turkish steam bath) with gym, all fit for an Emperor. I can think of only positives to describe this hotel and my great stay there.",5,2016,08,23

01,Super location though missing some care and real 5 star feel,"Really a super location and walking distance to most of the key sites in central Rome. With an interesting history itself and at night a very photogenic spot next to a Bernini fountain.   You feel that the owners are missing a trick.  The roof top bar was relatively new does have far reaching views however the seating doesn't really take advantage of it whilst the restaurant seemed to dominate the space more.  
Breakfast was a real let down, just fine, served on the first floor it felt like we were in an out of date banqueting room with too few staff and food presentation often lacking in 5 or even 4 star upkeep. why could breakfast not be served in the restaurant on the roof with its views?.  more people would go 'wow' each morning and write about it than our experience.  

We slept very well though rooms a bit musky smell on arrival -opened windows to sort that.  Staff nice but not overly concerned for you.  

Hotels in Rome are expensive and you feel this one which is  more mid 4 star is living off its location and in need of some attention which I hope it gets - as it could be great.",3,2016,08,10
01,Great hotel ,"Great hotel ,location is very central to all site seeing , buses,metro ,bars and restaurants,.As soon as you arrive at the hotel the front and foyer of the hotel gives your a feeling grandeur .Room was very spacious and clean . Roof top bar is fantastic and has a view to match .will definitely stay here again . ",5,2016,08,10
01,A view from the top,"My husband has stayed here many times and feels it is the best hotel in Rome.  We were unable to get a room during our one night in Rome on our way to Postitano, but we did come for cocktails and appetizers and wow, what a view of the city.  The roof top lounge is so modern yet elegant, there is not a bad seat anywhere.  We will make sure we stay here on our next trip to Rome",5,2016,08,07
01,"Wonderful Location, historic residence for your trip to Rome","Within walking distance to many attractions like Trevi Fountain.  I was also here for a tour scheduled lunch which started with Champagne, food was wonderful, and staff helpful and very pleasant.  Walk through the public rooms, stunning.",5,2016,08,05
01,"Excellent location, comfortable hotel","Great location, walk to Spanish steps (and all the great shopping!) , Trevi Fountain, Borghese, National Museum, Capuchin Crypts, Pantheon.  Short taxi or long walk to Vatican and Coleseum. Lots of restaurants ( all price ranges) around.  Good breakfast, nothing fancy but you won't go hungry.  Comfortable rooms.",4,2016,08,03
01,"Good location, but....","Nicely-positioned in Rome for walking to most of the major attractions.  This is an old, well-established hotel which has been visited by 'the great and the good' for many years and still trades on its former glory. A very expensive restaurant on the roof, but the spectacular views can only be enjoyed by a handful of tables. Breakfast was nothing special abd with very limited service. Overall, the staff were casual and customers did not seem to be their first focus.",3,2016,08,01
01,Great location!!!,"This hotel is in the best location for all of the sites of Rome!!  We could walk to the Spanish Steps, Trevi  Fountain and tons of shops in walking distance. The service was exceptional.  The room was spacious, well kept and very clean...  We enjoyed our stay!!!",5,2016,07,30
01,Average experience,The hallways and common areas smelled like smoke but our room was ok. The staff was't rude but they weren't friendly either. I found myself greeting them more than they greeted me. The stay wasn't worth the price. We wouldn't stay here again. ,3,2016,07,27
01,Perfectly located for seeing the sights!,"Location was key and the Bernini Bristol certainly suited us. A very short walk from the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps we enjoyed exploring the city by foot, taking roads less travelled. As an active couple we were happy to walk from the hotel to all the major sights including the Colosseum and St Peter's Basilica, not only did this allow us to take in even more of the city but it also helps us make room for extra gelato ;) 

The hotel itself was comfortable and had all the facilities we required. We made use of the hotel's spa, including the gym, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi and were impressed with our room. We had expected something more traditional from pictures we had seen but were pleased to find we had a modern room. Our only criticism of the room would be that the stylish full length mirror featured a pattern which although looked attractive wasn't the most practical for actually assessing one's outfit choice but how minor is that...? Also the bathroom which featured a walk in shower could have done with the depth of the tray being slightly extended or more tapered as some spray did go beyond the designated 'wet zone' but again, very minor. 

The staff were friendly and helpful, we were on a mission to improve our Italian so did try our best but when our language skills failed us we had nothing to worry about as everyone spoke very good English. 

Breakfast was well catered with lots of variety. The view from the roof terrace of the hotel is fantastic so even if you choose not to dine in the restaurant (as a michelin star restaurant it was priced to reflect) we would certainly recommend taking a drink in the terrace bar. 

We would certainly recommend it.",4,2016,07,25
01,Our favorite hotel,"The Hotel Bernini Bristol was our favorite hotel during our trip. Classy, comfortable, convenient! A few blocks and a nice walk to Trevi Fountains and other sights. Short taxi trips to Ancient Rome, Coliseum, Vatican, and other highlights. The breakfast was superb and room service was excellent. The rooftop restaurant was very expensive - I recommend others instead such as Alex Café a block away and La Grande Bellezza less than 1 mile.",5,2016,07,21
01,The July 2016 choice of superstars of rock,"... but that was not us. Nevertheless we were treated like superstars, our suite was beautiful, spacious and with a walk in shower, comfortable and quiet. Staff are as efficient and as friendly and co-operative as you could wish for. The roof top has a bar, Michelin- starred restaurant and is where brekky is served in the mornings - you could not have a more beautiful view for tucking into your scrambled eggs. Dinner in the restaurant is unusual - delicious but with a unique approach to cuisine and presentation, but again, it could be a vegemite sambo as the views are so spectacular (lucky it's not!). Great location - a short walk to the sights of Rome and 2 works by Bernini right in front of you. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,20
01,"Great location, great staff, mediocre rooms","It's just not really the 4 star hotel that they'd like to think it is.  It's nice, it's not great.  The location is perfect.  The staff were really kind and accommodating (although for a seemingly higher end hotel you'd think more of the front desk staff would be functional in English vs just getting by --- maybe that's really an American snobby thing of me to say, sorry).  
LOTS of people in Italy smoke - it is what it is.  And the 4 other hotels we stayed in during our trip (equal or higher quality) did a great job of keeping the rooms from not smelling like smoke.  This place - not so much.  We actually rejected two rooms (I rarely reject a room) before being placed into a clean but small room overlooking a side street.  For the price I'd say this was not a good deal.  It's not bad by any stretch but for what I paid I should have gotten more.  This is the type of place where you say to yourself - well, I came here to see the city and not to sit in the hotel room - as a way to make yourself feel better about paying too much for a mid-tier hotel.  

It was crazy hot when we were there and the air conditioning barely worked. 

On the other hand the concierge staff were super competent and helpful.  

The breakfast buffet was good.",3,2016,07,16
01,Great hotel with great location,"Location of the hotel is just great,close to everything,eating place,subway station is just in front,you can hop onto the hop on hop off tourist bus as you walk out of the lobby and you can even stare at the Barberini fountain from your room window like us that had the front facing room.
All the staff are very friendly and helpfull.
We stayed there before our cruise and back again after our one week cruise,the gentleman on the reception can remember us well,as his first word was ""how was your cruise"" ,this kind of attention is rare nowadays anywhere.
Without request,we were given connecting room with our daughter,a very nice touch and pleasant surprise.
Will definitely stay there again on future visits to Rome.",5,2016,07,11
01,"Great Location, Wonderful Experience","Room was larger than expected and well maintained. The location was absolutely perfect for sight-seeing. Nice rooftop view with reasonable prices at bar. Found the staff to be helpful and mostly friendly. Some equipment in fitness center was a little dated, but adequate. Morning breakfast in hotel was great. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,10
01,Hotel Bernini Bristol,Very nice luxury hotel.  The rooms are small (by American standards) but very modern.  The rooftop restaurant is nice with a beautiful view.  Close to local eateries and shopping. Would definitely stay there again.,5,2016,07,07
01,Everything was find until a bracelet was missing,"The hotel is pretty decent.  We had the deluxe room and it was spacious.  This is not a non smoking hotel.  We had a list of request and certainly a non smoking room was not given to us.  We simply opened the windows and were able to managed.  The last day a bracelet was missing.  Not expensive so not sure why someone would jeopardized their reputation by taking a guest item.  Management just said it was not found.  We turned everything around just to make sure but evidently was taken from our room.  Like I said it was not expensive (about $158) but it had a sentimental value for our daughter.  Very disappointed!  Also, rooms were not well maintained.  There were stained in the room.  It appeared to be mold, water damage or fire stain.  Furniture tapestry was old, musty and dirty.  I think management can do better by painting and steaming furniture.  Liaison was great and breakfast was great.  Staff was very nice!",2,2016,07,05
01,Not impressed! ,"It takes a great deal for me to complain...and, I am usually a big fan of all Small Luxury Hotels...But not quite sure how this one is allowed in the group! The one major positive of this place is the location, which is perfect.  Other than thst, the service is extremely rude, acting as if the guests are a complete nuissance. The rooms are fine, if you are paying less than $200 a night...but at over $500...one expects matching sheets, a quiet air conditioner that does not shoot, loud intermittent blasts all night and clean towels. All of which could have been forgiven, if the concierge service was not so inexplicably rude and condescending. Very disappointing.",2,2016,07,05
01,"Location,location",The location is brilliant for exploring Rome. Taxis on the doorstep. Spanish Steps walkable and all bus tours leave from Bernini Square. The hotel is very clean and the staff are great. We choose not to breakfast in the hotel as it is a no of a race round the buffet. The rooms are too small for the number of guests.,5,2016,06,27
01,"Great location, spacious rooms","We needed three rooms to accommodate our family and we were given a lovely suite of three attached rooms on the 2nd floor. The beds are very comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful with many choices. We were very pleased with the front desk staff and concierge, who not only was able to recommend some good restaurants but also was able to get us reservations for some other places we'd been dying to try. I would definitely return. ",4,2016,06,25
01,Honeymoon,"Lovely hotel although I wouldn't say it was a five star. Rooms are small but have everything you need, silk tapestries on the walls are amazing! Be wary of the mini bar and little jars of sweets they cost a fortune. Rooftop terrace is amazing, we are their on our first night looking out over Rome and it's simply breathtaking. The food very tasty but as expected with ""posh"" food, not much of it. Very close to the Trevi fountain and spanish steps, hop on bus tour stops just round the corner. Air conditioning was fab and a fairly decent hairdryer in the room. Breakfast a mixture of hot and cold foods, buffet style. Would stay here again, location ideal. ",4,2016,06,24
01,Great hotel - restaurant service should be better,"The hotel is situated in a great spot for those interested in walking to a lot of the iconic sights, assuming you don't mind a brisk walk. The front desk and especially the man on concierge (who was the tallest of the three we saw, but sadly we didn't catch his name) were first class, and if the hotel was good enough for Winston Churchill and Anita Edberg, it was good enough for me. If you want honest , helpful tips, see the concierge. He's a top man. Spacious rooms - ours was on the fifth floor, and on the side, so the view wasn't special, but that was no problem. It was quiet and that was what we wanted. We didn't use the spa area, but use of the jacuzzi and sauna etc is included in your rate. There is a calm atmosphere about the hotel. It seemed to be full from what we heard, but there was no noise or fuss. We slept well, the bathroom was good and plenty space to hang things. Our only gripe - and this is NOT down to the hotel - was that whilst the food quality in the restaurant on the top floor was top notch, and the views fantastic, the service of the staff on the day we were there was very poor. I shall write a separate review for that, but I mention it here because there's obviously a close relationship with the hotel. Would we stay here again? Certainly. It's not cheap, quite the opposite, but we were happy with what we got for what we paid.",5,2016,06,23
01,Great visit to Rome & Pompeii,"Hotel in a great location, close to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc.
Shame that we booked a 2 room suite with Piazza Barberini view, and checked in to find ourselves in a room at the side of the hotel overlooking the building next door. Hotel moved us to the correct room next day, but this is not what I expect from a hotel of this standard.",4,2016,06,09
01,Great time in Rome!,"Everything about the Bernini Bristol was great. Good location, great restaurant with a fabulous view...from the moment we arrived until we left we received excellent friendly treatment from all the staff. Best breakfast in all the places we stayed in Italy. We would definitely stay there again!",5,2016,06,06
01,Wonderful first time trip to Rome and Hotel Bernini Bristol,"We spent four wonderful nights at the Bernini Bristol last week and did not want to return home!  The hotel is perfectly situated in a safe area of Rome within walking distance of all of the main attractions.  All the staff were extremely friendly and polite, and the concierge were fantastic with great recommendations and assistance.
We booked a combined BA flight and hotel with Expedia in a classic room and were allocated Room 417 which was beautiful and quiet - it appears to have been recently refurbished - so much so we thought we had been upgraded!  Very clean bedroom and bathroom with great air con.
Do have cocktails on the roof terrace before you have dinner - not much more expensive than going out and it is a beautiful setting - G&T and Aperol Spritz can be highly recommended - served with lovely little snacks and great music.
If, like us, you do not like a large breakfast and have room only the hotel recommended Ginos just around the corner. Fantastic little coffee shop with the BEST ever coffee and pastries - all made in the shop and so light. The baristas there are so friendly and by the end of our stay knew our order as soon as we walked in. 
We had a wonderful short break and cannot wait to return to Rome and the wonderful Bernini Bristol Hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2016,06,02
01,Great Hotel!,"Visited this hotel three years ago while in Rome for 10 days. Just went back and stayed again. Great location and I would not stay anywhere else in Rome. The rooms are spotless clean, the bathrooms are as well (very important to me.)
Breakfast is amazing! The staff is very helpful and amazingly nice. Mario the doorman was there three years ago and when we returned again this April I was so glad to see him again. So helpful and such a nice guy!
The hotel is in a great location and is lit up at night so you can always find your way back.",5,2016,05,23
01,Had a drink in the rooftop bar,"We decided to have a drink in the rooftop bar of the hotel after a long and tiring walk in the streets of Rome ... and what a good decision it was :) We stepped into the hotel and walked through the stylish lobby and the elevator took us up to the 8th floor. There is a Michelin star restuarant there and a bar where we sat in just for a drink. The hotel staff was amazing, kind and gave full attention to us. The view is breathtaking from the rooftop. We enjoyed ourselves very much there. We even received discount but we still do not know if it was because we arrived at a special hour (between lunch and dinner time) or because we had great smiles :)",5,2016,05,18
01,Verry nice Hotel,"Hotel is located close to centar. Walking distance to Spanish stairs, Fontana di Trevi, Phantenon, Piazza Navona, 40 min walk to Vatikan.
There are good restorans nearby.
Hotel staff are frendly and kind, rooms are nice.
Brekfast is good.",4,2016,05,17
01,Good Location,"Impossible to get a room that didn't stink of smoke.  We finally settled on one with a patio,so we could get some air in.  Then the housekeeping staff didn't replace the toiletries and by the morning of the last day we ran out of toilet roll.  Not really what one would expect from a better quality hotel.   We stayed with the same hotel chain in Florence and the experience was much better.",3,2016,05,17
01,Fabulous Hotel,My best friend and I chose this hotel for a site seeing holiday due to its central location in Rome. Sitting on a busy roundabout for traffic I was amazed at how little traffic noise there was. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The breakfasts were lovely. The staff were very friendly. There are bus stops and subway stations right outside the hotel so very accessible. ,5,2016,05,13
01,Not a 5 star experience ,My parents brought myself and brother  away to this hotel for 4 nights. The experience was more inline with 4 star. The rooms were standard but the outside along the corridor looked more like a dingy 3 star. Breakfast was very standard and staff not so helpful. Would not recommend to anyone as the value for money spent was very disappointing. ,2,2016,05,09
01,Excelant! ,"This hotel is amazing! Not in such a crowded place , YET right in center of rome! Just a block away from Via De Corso and attraction centers.
Staff really is amazing and kind!
Would go again most definitely! And would recommend to friends and family. 
 ",5,2016,05,08
01,Very expensive 5 star hotel,The hotel had a good location -- walking distance from the Spanish steps but I did not feel like it was a five star hotel. The air conditioning was difficult to operate and did not work properly for 2 of the 4 nights we spent in the hotel. It was warm and uncomfortable inside the room.   We had to open the windows and it was not so quiet outside. This was not what we expected for a five star hotel that was so expensive.  The beds were also so uncomfortable.  The breakfast buffet was ok but not very impressive. We were there for 4 nights with not much variety in the food offered for breakfast.,3,2016,05,02
01,Excellent Hotel in a Great Location,"Overall, my wife and I had a great stay at the Hotel Bernini Bristol for our honeymoon.  The location is within walking distance to many of the main attractions in Rome.  Breakfast is included with your stay and the hotel also contains a rooftop bar with breathtaking views of Rome.  My only complaint is that the hotel staff was less than helpful with directions, dinner recommendations, and other requests as compared to other hotels we stayed in during our trip.",4,2016,05,01
01,Great Staff,"Staff is great, Nice Breakfast included, was close for all we tried to do 
Our biggest issue was poor internet service, always was cutting in and out, could not sit outside on our balcony and use the Internet. Also had ants on balcony, just needs sprayed 

Roof top Bar has great view and friendly staff, however be prepared for the drink prices, wine was $18 a glass, grey goose martinis are $, grey goose on the rocks was $15 for a shot",4,2016,04,28
01,Great hotel awful bed,So far the hotel is wonderful expect for the bed. The location is beautiful and there is plenty nearby. Lots of things within walking distance. The bed on the other hand is awful. It is harder than rocks. Not sure my back will survive the next 3 days.,4,2016,04,26
01,Bernini Bristol,"Our stay at Bernini was the end of a trip starting in the US to Belgium to London, England, to Istanbul. At Istanbul, we boarded an elite ship for sailing the Agean Sea, Med Sea, and finally on to Rome. We went to the Vatican for church service and then We checked into the Benini. My wife went straight to bed with total exhaustion. While I could not wait to get on the streets of Rome and burn as much daylight as possible. The next day, I had much to tell my wife about my site seeing and it followed that she too was anxious to view the area which she enjoyed much. We did not evaluate the overall hotel, no time for that. I do recall that the walls in our room was SILK and when I pressed gently on the wall with my finger, it gave with a soft feeling, that was a first for me, ""A Silk Wall"". The Bellman gave a GREAT Restaurant to visit and it was GREAT.  I would go back even tho it is quite old.",4,2016,04,25
01,An excellent hotel,"This is a superb property overlooking Piazza Barberini, a the foot of the Via Veneto.  Great location just off the tourist area, an easy walk to all sight-seeing areas in central Rome.  A lovely breakfast area with an astute staff, and an amazing rooftop restaurant/cocktail lounge which looks out over all of Rome, with the dome of St. Peter's framed in the distance.   ",5,2016,04,24
01,5 star hotel with a 2 star mattress ,"Unlike many reviewers before, we found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. We did however have a few issues...
 We spent our last 5 nights in Rome so we figured we would splurge on our room (after 3 in Venice and 3 in Florence, which were both 4 star hotels). Our room was at the far end of the hallway from the elevators but the halls echoed nightly of other guests talking and walking. The big gap under the door let so much light in that it was hard to sleep, on day 2 I used the extra blanket in front of the door.
 The worst part was the mattress, you could feel EVERY spring in it!! We spun it, flipped it and spun it again with no luck. I could have talked to the front desk but didn't figure I got the only bad mattress in the hotel.
 ",3,2016,04,23
01,Luxury hotel in a perfect location!,"The location of the hotel is perfect in the sense that it is of a maximum of 10 minutes walking distance from many major attractions and shopping streets, but at the same time, in a quiet area with no crowds. The service is good (although not perfect), the rooms quite small but comfortable and meeting 5-star hotel level, the breakfast buffet is extensive and of high quality with the beautiful views of Pizza Barberini. There is an amazing roof-top with a Michelin restaurant and a breathtaking 360-degree view of the whole of central Rome!",5,2016,04,15
01,Eric-Bahamas,"Excellent experience overall. Great location to easily visit many key Rome specialty sites, restaurants and cafes. Room was clean and comfortable, staff friendly and professional. Would definitely stay there again on a future visit. Staff made excellent recommendations of places to visit, restaurants to dine at, and how to get around. ",4,2016,04,13
01,Above average hotel in a good location ,"Nice looking from the outside. Dated rooms. Nice, clean, decent staff. Spotty wifi. 2 English TV channels with spotty satellite reception. Good breakfast. I would consider staying here again when we return.",4,2016,04,13
01,Worst Night in Rome,"No air conditioning left us with a 25 to 26-degree  Celsius room. Appeals for the repair of the a/c or change of room fell on deaf ears. Management was indifferent to our requests and made us wait for 3 hours before sending us a fan.

For its price, Hotel Bernini Bristol just doesn't care much and will just want your money. ",1,2016,04,05
01,Very professional and personable,"Easy to get to from the airport.  Good and clean.  Friendly staff.  Language friendly.  Close to good nightlife that was safe. Go to trastavere at night.  Take a cab. 

Hotel was a great value 

Go ahead and do the valet for an extra 49. And get the continental which had smoked fish and alot of great stuff",5,2016,04,02
01,Don't go Solo!,"There are no words! 5 Stars? 5 out of 20 maybe!  They woke me up to say I ordered a pizza.  Someone came to my door and knocked on 2 occasions on the first night.  Thereafter, the room service person phoned me.  I had to go to the front desk and show my receipt for my dinner a few hours earlier for them to believe me.  They did not give me an extra toilet roll and I had no paper one morning.  My toilet was not cleaned one night.  They gave me a bottle of wine and a cake on two nights.  I returned them and the concierge said I had to pay for them!!??  I was told by the next concierge that he did not understand.  There was a note from the manager.  I received a note from the manager on my last night to see him ASAP.  I thought someone had died.  I went downstairs when I arrived and no one knew anything.  I even said dead in Italian to her.  I gave one of the reception persons 5 euros after I got the wine to see if it would help.  NO!",1,2016,04,02
01,Best location,"My wife and I were staying at a Superior room. We received excellent service. Rooms are a bit small, but clean and luxurious. The first night we received a a non smoking room despite we asked for a smoking room. The next morning they switched the room for us and we even got san free upgrade. I highly recommend the hotel !!!",5,2016,03,28
01,Great place,"I was a little concerned to read a few less than favourable comments after I'd booked and paid for this trip - I'm not easily pleased so it was great to have my worries disappear within 10 min of arrival. 
The reception staff could not be more welcoming and flexible. Every part of the hotel I saw was exceptionally clean and nicely fragranced. The room was super comfortable and for an Italian city centre hotel - quite big. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and provided great service. Breakfast is varied, fresh and plentiful (loved the addition of breakfast chocolate eggs yesterday !) 
If I could make one suggestion it would be to step up the service in the roof bar as it can take a while to get served with quite expensive drinks. That said - Rome is not a cheap destination so drinking anything from water - coffee - champagne in a 5 star hotel is comparable to other expensive capital city bars. 
We really enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend the hotel and it's lovely staff ",5,2016,03,28
01,Perfect holiday ,"Just visited Rome for the first time and so thrilled to have chosen this hotel. Location was very central,easy access to the metro. The hotel itself was amazing and the staff extremely helpful,attentive and kind. Would highly recommend it.
",5,2016,03,24
01,Very nice hotel in a great location,"Very nice clean hotel with friendly staff . We enjoyed our stay here in March 2016 . The breakfast restaurant had a good selection of fresh food and the staff were friendly and accommodating . Our room was 502 , I highly recommend this room because it has a nice small balcony and faces the Piazza Barberini . Our only concern is that the hotel shuts off the air conditioning to the rooms because of the time of year . I would have preferred to have the option of using the air conditioning if I was so inclined . many of the major tourist attractions are within walking distance of this hotel , as weel as many good restaurants .",4,2016,03,23
01,FINE BUT STAYED IN FAR BETTER 5 STAR HOTELS,"We have just come back from Rome, We were given an upgrade of a suite which of course is always nice and makes the whole experience better. A few things needed attention, like some uk T.V programmes. No good having 2 TV's if they are all Italian tv's. We had the mini bar waiter enter without even knocking TWICE, both times I just had shower with very little clothing on. Hotel not sure it should be 5 star Needs a bit of TLC. Staff friendly. Breakfest not so good at weekends. Staff not so friendly and food over cooked. If we were to return we would choose another hotel near by as the location was great. 20 mins from most of the main things to see.",4,2016,03,22
01,Luxury in Italy,"We stayed with a travel group of about 50 people the week of March 14.  Hotel was super accommodating in getting us checked in and baggage to our rooms.  They also opened the wonderful breakfast room early for us on a few days, one so we could get over to see the Pope!  
Location was nice as it was close to the pharmacy when my husband came down with a cold & cough. Walking distance to some tourists sites made it nice.",4,2016,03,22
01,No AC  & bathrooms stink,Rooms have no AC.  I can't imagine being here in the summer.  It's mid March and the rooms are like a furnace.  We have 2 rooms and both bathrooms have a horrible sulphur smell that is overwhelming.  Do yourself a favor and cross this place off your list.,1,2016,03,20
01,What a nice boutique hotel!,"Amazing location! Walking distance to Fontana de Trevi, shopping area, restaurants... 10-15 min walking to Pantheon.
Very good, confortable, and Nice Rooms.
Very good service, great quality breakfast and good lunch was served.
Highly recomended!",5,2016,03,15
01,"Great location, good service, well equipped",This is a great hotel walking distance to the Trevi Fountains and Spanish Steps. It is next to a subway station so easy to go around. Breakfast selection is superb and the staff is great. Rooms starting from the 4th floor going up seemed to have been renovated with a minimalist set-up. Those on the third floor where I was moved from had the old dated decor. The fitness center is passable.,5,2016,03,12
01,a good option,"This hotel offers clean and spacy rooms decorated  with luxurious details. The staff is very nice and professional, ready to lend a helping hand anytime.
The location is perfect, just one step away from many significant sites.
Should I return to Rome again, Bernini Bristol will be my choice again.",5,2016,03,08
01,Our 3rd visit!,"This is the 3rd time that my parents, husband and I have stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol. 

The hotel itself is well decorated, clean, has a nice atmosphere and is very well located. The majority of rooms are nicely finished with all the amenities that you would expect. Something to note is that you can't get hold of an iron in your room so either iron your clothes before leaving home or give them to house keeping in plenty of time. Unfortunately we asked to swap rooms, which the staff were extremely helpful with, but at such short notice this meant that the room we ended up in was a little more tired around the edges. It was however larger than the previous and was more than adequate. The bed was very comfortable as well. 

We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was very nice - buffet and menu options -so cannot review the restaurant but we did get a couple of drinks at the rooftop bar which had a great atmosphere. The view from the restaurant looked pretty spectacular. 

We used the gym during our stay and that was well stocked with lots of equipment (treadmills, bicycles, weights machines or all types, mats etc.) and spent a little time in the sauna and Jacuzzi. The spa was really nice and I would recommend a visit there for a bit of relaxation during your stay. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic and a large part of Rome is in walking distance. You can easily access the Spanish Steps, The Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. There are also lots of great restaurants around the hotel. There is a parade of restaurants across the road to the right as you leave the hotel that are all fairly similar but serve good Italian meals. We also visited Pepy's Bar, which is on the opposite side of the fountain to the hotel and serves some good cocktails and food. 

The Hotel Bernini Bristol is a great hotel and I'm sure we'll be back!",4,2016,03,03
01,We'll be back.....,"We found the Hotel Bernini Bristol a lovely hotel  - quite traditional and a little quirky - but it worked for us.
Location - within walking distance of many attractions but less than 100m from the Metro and a busy taxi rank
Bar - on the roof - with some (limited) views over the city - not the cheapest - but there there are plenty around if you fancy a cheap glass of wine or beer
Room - well appointed with great views - maybe we were lucky!!
Front Desk - very friendly and helpful
Breakfast - a bit ropey really perhaps a little disappointing - but with a bit of a sense of humour it was fine
Overall - the hotel really worked for us - its a well known landmark and I'm sure we will be back - already looking g forward to it!",5,2016,02,20
01,"American bar offer is very poor, dining depressing and service incredibly bad","The American bar on the roof has no more than 30 bottles of which maybe only 3 are Gin.
The bartender took 15 minutes to serve a Gin Tonic (!!) and after asking 2 times whether I preferred Lime or Cucumber he finally put lemon, without asking, and after commenting: ""As I didn't have the Lime I've put lemon, is that ok ?"".
I don't think is necessary to comment on Tonic Water quality after that..

After the aperitif i've been on the terrace for a buffet dinner with 30 people. Dinner was really basic and service very bad. Deserts were served before cleaning the buffet table from the dinner and we've ended the dinner with buffet full of deserts, again no need to comment on quality, and no available dishes and as service disappeared after a while there was no one to ask!",2,2016,02,18
01,Excelent hotel,"We are a family of four (mother, father and two adolescent daughters)and stayed for three days at this great hotel. We had two big rooms,  one beside the other with a door between them that was opened at our request. The reception staff was very nice and kind, specially Giulia, Alessandra and the gentleman (concierge) that unfortunately I forgot the name. We had a little problem with the shower in one of the rooms that was promptly solved as soon as we asked for. The breakfast was good, but I don't know why people working there have to run so much, they are always running back and forth and although it doesn't compromise the service, of course, I think they should relax more.;)
The hotel is near everything, most of the places are walking distance. Great experience staying there.",5,2016,02,18
01,Needs a complete remodel.,"My room was clean, but the wood floor was extremely buckled from, possibly, water damage. When I walked from the bedroom to the bath, the floor would squeak and felt spongy, like it was about to fall into the room below. My room looked very outdated with the wallpaper which had been there for years. I was in the shower one night and the power went off. Everything was totally black. I groped in the dark for the door and a robe and everyone was peeking into the corridor (which was lit). We were never informed of anything. The elevators are crazy. You can't get to the restaurant from the same elevators as you use for the rooms. The staff was snooty, except for one older gentleman. My room was not ready when I checked in and it took them too long to check me out of the hotel. The military was outside my window, nightly. Apparently guarding the small fountain (not our hotel). This hotel is, somewhat, convenient to most things but when you head back to the hotel from the sites, you usually must walk uphill. By this time, you are tired and sure don't feel like walking uphill. I had tried to book the hotel for 6 nights but they were full, so I was only here 3 nights. I had to move to a smaller hotel about a mile away for the remainder of the time. I am so glad this happened. I stayed at the Realis Fontana Di Trevi and my stay, there, was great.",2,2016,02,18
01,"Terrible Hotel, very poor service, no hot water, below terrible","Rooms are dated, over priced, poor food.

No hot water in the room, waited over 2 hours for an engineer, in the end gave up.

Internet is sparse and you will be lucky to connect to it.

Will never use again, hotel needs to be torn down and the staff re trained.

Breakfast was a joke, stale bread, fried eggs were rubber, the sausage were little more than cutoffs, bacon was just fat.",1,2016,02,14
01,Hotel Bernini rooftop restaurant,Great restaurant although expensive. Excellent service and great decor if you love the bad boys of the comic world which provides the theme. In the winter months it is better to sit inside the restaurant and save the outdoor terrace for the summer months. A taster menu here starts from 90 Euros and the wine is expensive.,5,2016,02,14
01,Excellent choice in Rome,"I am travelling a lot over the world, I booked the hotel because of  location and choose a deluxe room.  6 Days in Rome in The Bernini is simply chic. Not apt for snobish. The room was very large, with all the details of Luxury hotel but with tradition. I mean, they do not disturb you any minute for no reason... The maid know if you were in the room and do not enter to open your bed. Perfect high class style. The reception desk managers always helpful, the Roof Top Restaurant prepare my New Year;s  Eve dinner and it was served exact at time required in my room ( I was travelling alone)  and it was superbe. Breakfast was very good with a fantastic made home bread.  Of course, nothing is perfect,  and my first day I cannot get internet connection ( but it was perfect to disconnect from work) but as I am always  travelling a lot around the world,  for sure I will choose Bernini for my next trip to Rome. What else?",5,2016,01,08
01,I couldn't stay there,"Very poor rooms , old and worth 2-3 stars category not more. We were booked there for a 5 stars hotel and was surprised that this was not the case. The reception staff was extremely kind and tried to help but hotel was not as expected.",2,2016,01,05
01,Great location but not much else,"We booked this hotel through the Luxury Small Hotels of the World website (don't waste your time). When we arrived the doorman just grimaced at us and treated us like we were wasting his time (we got this same attitude from him for the entire trip including upon check out). There was also a woman sitting in a small office behind the reception that had an even worse attitude than him. When he took our bags in he didn't roll them but rather just dragged them across leaving a lovely gash through my new suitcase. The visit went down hill from there. We were told we were given a lovely room for our honeymoon with a terrace. When we got there the room looked out onto the windows of the building next door, the terrace was not very inviting and all the terraces were beside each other so you could go from one to the other if you so desired!!!  The wifi was non existent and as I had specifically asked for it as we needed to use it I was pretty annoyed. Not only could we not get wifi (no matter what we were told to try) we also did not have phone reception. A complete pain. We were then told to try the roof top bar so we decided to do that. We sat up there for 15 minutes and eventually had to ask someone if they were serving. They told us they were busy as they had a function but what did we want! Needless to say we just left. We told them downstairs where we had been recommended from and the answer was oh well basically. The next day when we checked out we told them about the wifi again and all we got was that we should have told them and we could have moved rooms (I had actually told them a number of times to no avail). The woman from the little office was quite annoyed and made this quite clear to us. The only plus is that the housekeeping staff were delightful and the room was nice and clean. We will never go back to this hotel and would definitely not recommend it. This was the first night of our honeymoon in Italy and definitely not one I care to remember. Thanks for the memories - NOT!",2,2015,12,28
01,Not Impressed.,"We have sat opposite this hotel on a number of occasions enjoying a snack at Pepi's Bar nearby. We checked it out online and booked for August 2015.
The hotel is good, no pretences there, however, the decor is a little tired and dated.
We chose a Junior suite, it was on the second floor. It was drab, had a terrible view looking into a building across the street, it was poorly located, total disaster and no change of room available. Other hotel facilities such as the restaurant, rooftop lounge had a great view of the city, but that's about all.",4,2015,12,28
01,Great location for walking round Rome.,"We stayed four nights at the Hotel Bristol Bernini.
Can't really comment much on the hotel itself, as we spent most of our time out and about, but our room was very nice, looking out across Piazza Bernini.
The hotel is very clean throughout, and we always returned to a refreshed room, and everything as it should be.
We were able to walk to lots of attractions. It's only minutes to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps on foot, and even the Vatican isn't far.",4,2015,11,25
01,Travelling with an electric wheelchair,"This hotel at least has an available ramp to grant entrance. The staff are wonderfully helpful BUT the lifts are too narrow to enable easy access. One has to request the porters help to force the doors a little wider and hold them while you attempt to go in- getting out is more problematic ! It is also necessary to call 10 minutes prior to going out or returning so the porter can find the ramp and put it into position.
Travelling partially on footpaths and sometimes on the road is very scary - no wine at lunch for this wheelchair traveller",4,2015,11,13
01,"Elephant, Warm, excellent Location","I flew in to Rome to jump on a cruise and stayed for two days. The hotel us gorgeous, my suite was spacious the concierge was so helpful and the location is in a beautiful neighborhood. To the left is shopping and cafes and to the right are beautiful town homes and tree lined streets.",5,2015,11,13
01,Avoid ,"Really poor hotel.  To name a few examples.  Blocked bathroom sink which cannot be fixed since it is evening, room next door with connecting door such that one can hear everything (conversation,  toilet flush etc),  no wifi reception in room. Naturally no complimentary water at night.   Just avoid.  My first review on ta and am writing from our terrible room in the hotel. Luckily one night only!    5 stars?   In which world?",1,2015,11,07
01,Perfect!,"We were in Rome Oct 2015 and stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol for three nights. We found the hotel to be very spacious, elegant, with modern amenities and conveniences! The location is unbeatable with Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps blocks away. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel has free wifi. Be sure to book the package with breakfast included. It was a full spread with hot and cold selections, all very delicious. Note: the room service breakfast does not apply to the included breakfast. Remember to bring your electricity converter. Super hotel! Book with confidence!",5,2015,11,07
01,"Incredible Location, Great Property, First-Class Service","Beautiful hotel overlooking the Piazza Barberini.  The rooms in the front have incredible views of the Fontana del Tritone lit up in the evening.  The staff is all that you would expect from a 5-star European hotel.  Great!  Fantastic location in the city.  Many great restaurants and cafe's within a few blocks.  Trevi Fountain is just down the street and other landmarks only a few blocks more.  When I go back to room, this is the place I'll stay.",5,2015,11,03
01,A Secret Worth Sharing,"The hotel is listed as a small luxury hotel and the amount of service and professionalism displayed hits the nail on the head! The hotel is located in a beautiful area a few minutes walk to Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps. From the balcony of our room, we could see the Pantheon, Vatican and  several churches. Every step from the hotel leads to great food locations. Oh, let me not forget the subway is right in front of the hotel. You can't go wrong! We arrived early and they allowed us to check in which is not normal for a lot of hotels. So, now for the finishing touch. ",5,2015,10,24
01,Surviving on an undeserved reputation,"This is a hotel that is maintaining high room rates on the basis of a reputation that it no longer truly deserves. The reception staff failed to acknowledge us at any time after the initial check-in during the four days we stayed.  Our room was very small and the turndown service unreliable. The doorman was not keen to open the door, carry luggage, hail a cab or look remotely pleased to see anyone arrive.
Breakfast was a fiasco. They were unable to accommodate the number of guests in the hotel and there was often a queue and always a wait to be seated. They were unable to keep the crockery or food replenished and we never established, despite asking several times, how the serving of coffee was supposed to be managed. After the first two days we found random cups in the dresser and helped ourselves from the pot. 
The hotel is ideally situated for some of the artistic and archaeological attractions and there was nothing horribly wrong other than breakfast so if we were paying 3* rates we probably wouldn’t have batted an eyelid. It did not, however, live up our expectations of an elegant 5* hotel and we would not visit again.",2,2015,10,23
01,Stay 11 to 15 October 2015,"Two couples had booked this holidy.
Although we had supposedly been upgraded to Superior Rooms 509 and 519 only one of these rooms had a bath and neither were what one would call superior. We swapped rooms the following morning the 12th and my partner and  I then moved to a different room R 504 as the air conditioner in 509 could not be turned off.
In Room 504 the hot water was not hot and we called reception. By the way the toilet door did not close either! The maintenance appeared and after some time left with no comment. 30 minutes later the water was just about hot enough for a bath and my partne was just going to the bathroom when the maintenance man reappeared, no knock at the door – upsetting and embarrassing to say the least!!. 
After turning the lights off and going to sleep on the second the light outside the bathroom door continued to flash until we disengaged the door key from the socket. This light was replaced.
When my partner went to use the hair dryer it crackled, smelt of burning and sparked – it was clearly unfit for purpose. This was reported and never used again. Not sure if it was ever fixed.
There was no bar service at all in the lounge seating area. This was even more irritating as there were no coffee/tea making facilities in the bedrooms. The 8th floor roof bar and restaurant were very wet on the 2 nights it rained – leaking through the non-permanent/canvas roof. Great if the weather is OK.
The breakfast was not refreshed for much of the time and repeated asking for croissants, smoked salmon, fruit, glasses for fruit juice etc. achieved little after one request for more.
We had requested a car for 6 in the evening on the 15th to return to the airport. At 6am in the morning were woken to say the car was ready!!! Although I had signed for 6 o’clock it was not checked by the concierge and the Assistant manager tried to get payment fort this error although he waived any further charge after mentioning the catalogue of disasters we had experienced.. 
The Hotel Bernini is extremely well positioned but lacks any aspect which would amount to a 5 star rating on the strength of our visit.",1,2015,10,17
01,Beautiful Hotel in GREAT location,"We loved this hotel. Right on Bernini piazza in a prime location to all the sights. For Europe our room was very large. The room was very clean and serviced professionally every day. It is a great location for all the sights and all transportation is within 25 yards of the hotel. We had a deluxe room that looked out on the piazza and the view was incredible. The Bernini piazza had many great restaurants and gelato shops within a few steps of the hotel.
The staff was friendly and courteous. Most everyone in the hotel spoke English. The breakfast buffet that was included was outstanding. The pastries and cappuccino were to die for. When we return to Rome this is the hotel we will choose. 
Would recommend to anyone traveling to Rome.",5,2015,10,15
01,Lack Lustre,"Hotel in a terrific location, rooms a good size and very clean. However, this hotel is quite an expensive five star, which did not include breakfast in our package. Throughout our stay there was little evidence of door staff and on not one occasion was the door held open for us let alone our luggage carried from our taxi to reception. Our check out was shocking, the Receptionist carried out the process whilst continuing her conversation with her colleague and did not ask if we had enjoyed our stay etc.
Facilities seemed reasonable in the hotel but we felt as though the staff just about tolerated us interrupting them to check in and out because otherwise we were not acknowledged or interacted with in any shape or form. WiFi advertised as free, alas we only received a very weak five minutes and after that there was a levy of 10 Euros/ day.
We have already decided that we will not be returning here and have found a friendlier hotel for our return visit in February.",2,2015,10,13
01,Great location in central Rome and good quality hotel,"We had our company trip to Rome so back in March, we went to see about 8 x 5* hotels and Hotel Bernini Bristol was our chosen one for quality of stay, quality of food and central location.  It is literally 5 mins from both Spanish Steps and from Trevi Fountain.  We ate at their Michelin starred restaurant on the 8th floor, food was excellent and the view of Rome was amazing.  Helen Mirren was even staying there during our trip.",5,2015,10,11
01,Wet weekend in Rome,The Bernini Bristol is in a very good location; the staff are friendly and helpful; the rooms are clean and comfortable.  The buffet breakfast was extensive but a bit disappointing as we like fresh fruit and the fruit on offer was under-ripe.  Also the coffee was weak and not very hot.  We stayed for four nights and the first night we were on the first floor and found the room too noisy.  There was no problem with changing to a quieter room the next day.  The seventh floor was much quieter.  During our stay there were two different concierges who were extremely helpful with arranging tour guides and suggesting restaurants.  We would stay there again.,4,2015,10,10
01,"Nice hotel, good location, but the staff...","The hotel is in a great location, very central and easy to walk to most sites.

The hotel is nice, decorated nicely and our room was great.  The roof bar and restaurant are lovely but ridiculously  expensive.  To many of the staff are snappy and grump and should really learn the value of manners and a smile.  

Turn that frown upside down Bernini Bristol",3,2015,10,06
01,Only 5 star position,What a disappointment. Not what I expected considering it is rated as a 5 star hotel. On arrival was told they didnt have the 'superior' room as advertised unless we wanted a large double bed. No -we were two singles. Offered another 'superior' room on 6th floor -no balcony or terrace. Was it just us or were they used to the awful smell that hits you as you exit the elevator to that floor. Room was basic- someone needs to explain the word 'superior' to them. Took that room as we had no choice. As I said - the position was 5 star - close to everything and bus right outside our door. Yes thanks for the chocolate at night and turning down the bed but not even asked how things were the whole time we were there. .,2,2015,10,04
01,"Perfectly located, within walking distance to local attractions!","We were in Rome for 4 days and stayed at the Bernini Bristol.  It was a perfect home base for our first visit to Rome.  We walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and more....  The hotel itself was very nice, with a lovely restaurant on the roof, with great views of St Peters Basilica.  My only concern was with the bed.  I know European beds are usually much firmer than Americans are used to, but for my taste, it was really too hard.  Other than that, the room was great, very clean and well appointed with all the necessary amenities.",4,2015,10,02
01,"Good location, needs maintenance, spotty service, expensive.","We are staying here for 6 nights and would have moved hotel if not for the fact that we prepaid the room before arrival and I do not feel like going through the hassle.  The hotel needs a freshening up all around.  Loose rails in the slow ancient elevators, missing tiles in the sauna, old equipment in the tiny gym, scratched up furniture, etc.  I am sure it was lovely 20-some years ago.  The bed is comfortable and the concierge is great.  The team at reception and in the breakfast area is very up and down.  If the hotel as Euro 150 a night I could live with that, but at more than Euro 300 a night I expect much much more.  By the way, the hotel does not have a pool accessible to all guests.  The pictures are from a pool that comes with the residential suite, so leave your swim suit at home.  I spend 100+ nights in a hotel per year from Beijing to Frankfurt to Sao Paulo.   I do not write bad reviews often, but this was a real disappointment.",2,2015,10,02
01,Great place with not such a great service,"I've stayed at the Bernini when I was a child traveling with my parents and had great memories. I was quite excited to celebrate my wedding anniversary in Rome and booked the presidential suite. 

The room was amazing: private swimming pool, a small gym area, and outstanding views.  It was pretty spacious and really comfortable, although the decoration was a bit of.
However, I expected much more from a 5* Lux Hotel, part of Small Luxury Hotels.
The staff at the reception were pretty cold when we arrived (with tne exception of both the porter and the doorman that were really nice and efficient).
At our arrival, we didn't receive any explanation regarding the hotel facilities and schedules. As an example, we were unable to find any instructions to open the door to the swimming pool (we gave up thinking it was broken), and had the same problem with the TV (we found it had been unswitched) and the hammam option for the shower. 
 We found the breakfast options quite outdated regarding current food trends: only regular milk and white bread were available. 
We also visited the bar on the roof and the experience was surreal. The bar tender was in an awful mood complaining aloud ""she was alone every night and had too much on her plate"", while she was moving around the glasses with fury. It took us more than 20 min to get a drink ...with only 3 tables to serve.

I believe this hotel strongly lacks personal care, attention to detail  and staff management skills. It can't compare to the way hotels are managed and run in the US in terms of customer experience.

 It's a shame with such a great location and facilities. I do miss the old times!",3,2015,10,01
01,Bitter suite,"The Bernini Bristol is a very well-located five-star hotel, within easy walking distance of the Trevi fountain and the Spanish Steps. It's location is the best thing going for it. We had a junior suite, which was quite well-presented -- except that it was on the 7th floor, immediately below the terrace dining area. It was extremely noisy, latre into the night. Another quibble was that the suite was really two conventional rooms, forced into a lounge and bedroom configuration rather than a purpose-designed suite. It didn't quite work. The staff was ''mature'' and somewhat surly and little things -- like a different pot for coffee each morning, including a milk jug filled with cofee -- spoke of a lack of attention to five-star detail. My wife tried the much-vaunted spa -- a found herself sitting in grit! It definitely didn't deliver the experience one would have expected for the rather steep cost. We won't stay there again.",3,2015,09,28
01,HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO ORGANIZE A BIRTHDAY CAKE WITH ALMOST TWO WEEKS NOTICE?,"I booked my Mother and my sister for a night to celebrate my Mum's birthday in Rome. My sister fell from London and since I live in Australia I thought I could add a birthday cake as a surprise to her booking. It was, incidentally, one of the options offered amongst the extras you can add to your room reservation on the hotel's website. The charge came through and the hotel even sent a re confirmation a few days ago. However when my family checked in.....you guessed it! No cake. So I was not there and my Mother did not get the cake I had ordered for her as a surprise with best wishes for her birthday. When my sister checked with reception they admitted to have the information in the booking but could not explain why it had not been done.....well it hadn't and I am furious. Being on the other side of the world I would have thought I could rely on a ""5 star"" hotel to deliver a birthday cake with plenty of notice!!!!",1,2015,09,27
01,See Bernini at the Bernini Bristol,"A cherished memory of my youth and a lovely place to stay still, 46 year later Having been fortunate enough to travel to Roe and th Italian countryside throughout my life, the Bernini has been a constant, like a well kept, maintained and shiny jewel. Its only ""fault"" if you will, is that its in house restaurant is not as good as what is available in the rest of Rome and that is a high standard to be compared to
You will enjoy your stay at the foot of the Via Veneto, not too far from the U.S. Embassy many fine coffee shop such as the Donay and with walking distance of the Park surrounding the Villa Borghese.
Enjoy and life a glass of Compari and toast good times!

01,Fabulous Lunch,"On a ship's excursion we stopped at the hotel for lunch. Very traditional, but still modern we had an excellent set menu lunch. Service was excellent. Lunch was served with house red or white wine.

A most enjoyable lunch.",5,2015,09,23
01,Great location 4 nights in Rome,"The hotel may not be 5 stars anymore but it's location is perfect.  Close to everything, friendly staff and management. The rooms were very nice, the only real negative was a fish odor in the hallways on two days.  The roof top restaurant is one of the best in all of Rome.  Expect 4 stars and take advantage of their great rates, good deal!",4,2015,09,23
01,Ciao Bernini !,"Lovely hotel, modern, great facilities off a busy piazza. Located on Piazza Barberini, close to great restaurants, stores and walking to many places. Delicious breakfasts which we had included in our cost, lovely spa and lobby area. People were helpful and nice.",5,2015,09,21
01,A real *****L,"All what you can expect from a (perfectly located - in the middle of historical Rome) five star L hotel - friendly personnel; a perfect breakfast, a nice view from the roof terrace and all amenities a demanding customer can expect.
Added to our list of preferred hotels
One little minus - it took close to 30 min to get our drink served in the bar (1 bartender is maybe a little bit short.",5,2015,09,21
01,Lovely Italian hotel in the heart of Rome,"I brought a group to this hotel, and it did not disappoint. The highlight of this property is the roof top restaurant and patio. Just unbelievable views of the city and St. Peter's Basilica. As the sun sets over the city, the views just get better and better. The rooms are very traditional Italian, which is great. The bathrooms are a bit small, but marble counter tops and tile are beautiful. The one thing that did cause issues was the elevators. They are quite small and very slow. With only two of the three working, it made for a wait trying to use them. Other than that, it was great. Walking distance to almost everything and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.",4,2015,09,19
01,"Great Location, Do NOT miss the Rooftop garden and restaurant","We enjoyed our stay, love the location at Piazza Barberini.  The staff was great, especially Maria and Dante.  Be sure you get the WIFI password at check in!  To those not familiar with the system, you need to put your room card in a special slot to have the electricity work in your room.  Also, we had received a 20 Euro credit for lunch or dinner in the rooftop restaurant, but be sure to take the credit information with you to receive it.  The public can eat at the restaurant, so even if you are staying somewhere else, come do this.  the setting and views are great.  They have a lunch special which includes wine, water and dessert which we enjoyed.  The battery on our door lock failed and we had to wait about 45 minutes for maintenance to change it and then another 20 minutes or so for the room to be cleaned.  The maid tried to clean the room earlier, could not get it, but did not report it to anyone.  It was inconvenient as we were trying to get ready to go to dinner, but they did take care of it once the problem was determined. (but no compensation to us for the inconvenience. Something, wine, or small discount would have been appreciated)   We like the hotel and will certainly consider staying there again in the future.",5,2015,09,19
01,"Great hotel, great location","My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol with our older parents.  When we arrived in the morning Maria at the front desk put a rush on our parents rooms and they were situated much earlier than the scheduled check in time.  Each of the concierge were extremely helpful and recommended great local restaurants.  The rooftop restaurant/bar was great with terrific views of the city. 

The doorman assisted us each day and was pleasant, interesting and engaging. Our room was very nice We with a balcony and a terrific view of the Vatican. 

This is a true 5 star hotel!",5,2015,09,15
01,Great location and very attentive staff,"We stayed for one night before starting a cruise - the hotel was really nice , staff were really helpful especially the concierge who gave us lots of great tips 
Hotel restaurant was amazing - fab food ( a little pricey) but never the less very good ....and such stunning views!!!",4,2015,09,15
01,Would definitely stay there again.,Very comfortable hotel in the grand style.  An older building tastefully refurbished.  The rooms are good sized and well appointed.  The staff throughout were friendly and very helpful.  The rooftop terrace restaurant has a fantastic view over the city and the food and service are excellent.,5,2015,09,15
01,"Great location, Not the most Honest establishment","We arrived from the U. S. Exhausted, and worried about being able to check in early. We were pleasantly surprised when we were told the hotel had a room immediately available for us. We had vouchers which we presented from our travel agent stating we had a suite. We got upstairs and found we were in a cramped small room which could not accommodate our family, definitely not a suite.
 My husband went down to the front desk and they said, No problem, we'll move you as soon as another room is available. Feel free to shower and take a nap until 3 and we'll call or send someone up when the room is available. At this point I thought about all the negative reviews I had read and decided they must have made some changes. 
 However, No one ever called or came upstairs to move us.
My husband finally said this is ridiculous, we can't unpack and get settled in. So he went back downstairs several hours later and they claimed to have forgotten that we had paid for a suite.  
Eventually, they moved us, but based on previous reviews this seems to be a typical pattern in this hotel. I was happy with our room once we were relocated, however the noise from the street and the restaurant with the live music around the corner makes it an undesirable location for future visits. I will say throughout the encounter the desk clerks were never rude. We got the impression they needed someone's permission to make changes,as they kept going to talk to someone in the back!

The only reason we chose this hotel was the difficulty we were having finding last minute accommodations for 3 or more people. Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps are within walking distance, but I'm sure there are lovely hotels that are hassle free.",3,2015,09,10
01,"Five-star, elegant, traditional Italian hotel ...","I have been to Rome many times and stayed at different hotels. I found that the Hotel Bernini Bristol has the ideal central location. Set at the top of the Piazza Barberini, the Piazza rooms have views across Rome, and, all the major attractions are within easy walking distance. The Via Veneto starts at Piazza Barberini, and the Spanish Steps, and the designer stores of the Via Condotti and Via Babuino, are only a short distance away. In addition, the metro is right next to the hotel, and that’s handy for getting to and from the Vatican.

Being five-star, the hotel lives up to those expectations in every respect. My room facing the Piazza was very large, elegant in a traditional Italian manner, and with a modern marble bathroom. It was nice to come back to after hours of walking in historic Rome. I’ll return.",5,2015,09,09
01,Great hotel,Lovely hotel in a great location. Has very good service and amazing view from roof top bar. It is a little dated in places and we moved room as were give a twin bed instead of requested double. They dealt with us most helpfully when we raised our issue. You have to appreciate the fact the building is nearly 200 years old. If you see that as a feature rather than a detractor you will enjoy your stay no doubt. The Gym could do with a bit of repair work to some of the machines but no but me used it whilst i was there.,4,2015,09,09
01,Beautiful Hotel,What a beautiful hotel.  It was located in a great spot.  Blocks from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.  The lobby was gorgeous and everything was nice and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.,5,2015,08,31
01,Excellent,"We stayed only one night in this hotel (would love to spend more days here). The location is great (Piazza Barberini is beautiful), not far from the Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain (which is absolutely breathtaking). The hotel were magnificent. The only ""shame"" is that we only spent one night here.. We will be back!",5,2015,08,31
01,Excellent,"This hotel has been excellent.  We had a terrace room on the second floor. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again when in Rome.  Service was fantastic and the location was ideal for walking around,  taxi outside door, next door to hop on  and off bus. Hotel Bernini Bristol my mum,  sister and I loved our stay with you. ",5,2015,08,29
01,Top location - top old style service great decor and lush bedding!,"I just love Rome but I have stayed in many hotels in the city of romance and not all of them were to my liking . So, having saying that I will share that the stay at the berbirini Bristol was delightful. The room decor was a mix between old and new with great bath room and to die for view over looking the piazza in front ! 
Great breakfast good service and in all well deserved his five stars !
Will come back !

01,Needing Attention.,"The Bernini is in a great location at Piazza Barberini, close to the Via Veneto, restaurants, Fontana di Trevi, Spanish Steps and the Metro.
However, Reception staff were poor, both at arrival and departure, the hotel is a little tired inside relying on faded history. Our room, a Junior Suite was dull and disappointing with a view from the 1st. Floor of a dull building across a boring street,  why this floor for suites ? The restaurant has a lovely view across Rome, the food was ok, the staff were no more than average. The hotel lacks an area to relax, maybe with a small pool. Some photographs show a small pool which is misleading, it's only for guests in that room.",3,2015,08,15
01,"Great location, excellent room and friendly, professional staff.",We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay in this comfortable hotel.  We stressed that we required good a/c and were upgraded to a junior suite without asking.  The location is excellent and the staff were very professional and friendly.  I recommend this hotel.,4,2015,08,12
01,30th wedding anniversary trip,"We went to Rome and stayed in the Bernini Bristol hotel for a 30th wedding anniversary. The hotel itself does indeed look and feel like a 5 star hotel and everybody was helpful.  We were initially placed in a room that was fantastic but the air conditioning was very poor and as we were in the middle of July we asked to be moved to another room which was better.  In the rooms there is a price on everything so we did not touch anything for fear of a big bill at the end.  We were there on a B&B bases which was lovely but as we went on a quite a few early trips they would not accommodate the fact that we would have to be out a little before the restaurant opened, but would for a fee of £12 bring food to our room.   On leaving the hotel we thought we were just checking out but was greeted with a bill of 70 euros tax because we had stayed in a 5 star hotel.  We did quibble the fact and was able to forgo paying this by signing a form to the government saying why we did not think this particular task was warranted.  With all that said it was a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area and we enjoyed our stay very much.",4,2015,08,07
01,"Lots of style, little else","We were sent to this hotel when our booked hotel had a ""problem"" with our booking.  I was told that this was a better quality hotel than the one we were booked into and although it was a 5 Star (over a 4 star we were booked into) when you scratched below the surface there wasn't much else.  It was very nice but I wouldn't choose to stay there, very grand, but little ragged around the edges.",3,2015,07,31
01,Good but not great,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in July as part of a cruise holiday involving an overnight in Rome.
The Hotel is in a convenient location, we had a quiet & comfortable bedroom and good breakfast in nice surroundings.The air conditioning was not so good and we had a rather warm night. 
We plan to return to Rome for a longer stay and would stay at this hotel again but only after comparing other equally convenient hotels first.",4,2015,07,28
01,Enjoyable hotel with excellent views of the city from the bistro,"My husband and I enjoyed our 2 nights at Hotel Bernini Bristol.  We were not huge fans of Rome compared to other places we visited during our trip, but my favorite part of our stay in Rome was actually eating dinner at the hotel bistro on the 7th floor.  The view of the sunset over the city and the Vatican made for a very relaxing and peaceful dinner.  Our room was large, clean, cool, and tastefully decorated. We did have a little bit of trouble connecting to the wifi, but once we finally connected it was  no issue.  Compared to other hotels we stayed at during our time in Europe, I would say that this one did lack a bit in service.  Overall though we were very pleased with our stay.",4,2015,07,27
01,Two nights in Rome.,"Very nice hotel. Situated in a great spot. The hop on off bus right next door. Many good restaurants in the area as the one in the hotel is a Michelin star and with Rands rather a lot of money. 
The waiting staff were a little unfriendly but the rest rather nice..
My experience on the whole was a good one.
.",4,2015,07,27
01,Disappointing,"The hotel is centrally located and the room was ok other than the A/C that everyone has posted about.  What was most disconcerting is that our room, although on the 5th floor, overlooked a pizza joint that played loud music until midnight, making sleep impossible.  If you cannot sleep at a hotel you might as well not have booked there, especially at these 5 star prices.  The staff was not understanding and actually lied to us by saying that there would be no music on Sunday night. Here I am in the room listening to bad music at 11 at night needing to catch an early train to Florence.  There is literally no excuse for this, especially since we were not warned and were lied to.  Never again !!",2,2015,07,19
01,"Not bad, but there were just a few little things...","I enjoyed Rome, and Hotel Bernini Bristol was not bad, but a little pricey. The wifi did not work in my room (309) and I had to sit in the hall, but I would kick back with a glass of wine. It worked out fine. My itinerary promised a complimentary bottle of wine, and when I asked about it, the front desk said, they were unaware of that offer. Breakfast came with my room rate and it was good. It started at 7am and I missed the first day because I had to leave earlier to walk to my tour meeting spot, but, again, no big deal. The bar across the street featured a loud piano player and singers 2 of the 3 nights until after midnight, I recommend bringing earplugs. The shower door is a half door or something, and I could not keep the water in the shower, but a bath towel on the floor helps soak it up. Spa is okay, but not as clean or glamorous as the pictures depict. The location is fantastic and I walked everywhere. I recommend catching a play/opera at the outdoor theater. I walked there, an hour walk, and taxied back to hotel. The room was clean and quaint. The stairs do not go to the first floor and you are forced to take the elevator, and it is really slow. I don't recommend or not recommend this hotel, it was fine, but I imagine you could do better for the price. ",4,2015,07,19
01,Now catering for large groups?,"Excellent location, good breakfast, clean rooms and good A/C  and wi-fi during our stay. The standard of service is patchy though. They seem to be interested more  in  catering for big groups and parties than individual travellers. Shame seeing this change as compared with the state of things two years ago. The reception area is under-staffed and too small for the volume of visitors they have taken on. Overall, ok but not as special as anticipated.",3,2015,07,18
01,Charming old hotel but poor A/C and poor wi-fi,"This is a charming hotel, well located in terms of walking to most of the Rome sites. But we stayed when it was hot outside and the air conditioning in the guest rooms is poor, a view shared by other guests while we were there.  Wi-fi in the guest rooms also was poor-- you had to go in the halls or lobby to get it consistently.  Nice breakfast buffet-- make sure it is included in your rate; otherwise, it is pricey.  For the money (the hotel is fairly expensive), I would stay elsewhere, especially in the warm summer months!",3,2015,07,14
01,So So,"The location is GREAT for getting all over the key spots in Rome but the A/C was BAD at best and the rooms need some serious updating for sure.  The breakfast buffet was not good at all, everything was cold including eggs, bacon etc.

The roof top bar was great and Mas the concierge was AMAZINGGGG....",3,2015,07,13
01,Doesn't deserve 5 star rating,"We stayed here twice during our 6 weeks in Rome. For 3 nights at the beginning and 2 nights at the end and it was disappointing both times. The breakfast was the worst we had in the whole holiday. All the ""hot"" food was cold, terrible scrambled eggs and the bacon was swimming in fat. Even the water for the tea was lukewarm. Not satisfactory for a 5 star hotel. The concierge staff were not very helpful and seemed very disinterested when we asked for suggestions of tours etc. The Rooftop Bar was very pleasant but there was only one waiter and although he did the best he could, it was seriously understaffed and very expensive. It is a pity because the hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice",3,2015,07,13
01,Location was perfect!,"The location of this hotel cannot be beat.  You are within easy walking distance of the Trevi Fountain (still under renovation), Spanish Steps and Pantheon.  View from the restaurant/bar is fantastic.  

We were there during a heat wave and had issues with the A/C in our first room.  Hotel staff was great about moving us to one in which the A/C worked.  However, the A/C is not cold like in the US, but much better than the oppressive heat outside.  We had trouble with our second room because it developed a leak.  Once again the staff was great about moving us to a fantastic room on the seventh floor.  Normally, I would not be inclined to give a favorable to review to a hotel in which I had to move twice, but every hotel can have problems, but I judge them by how they deal with them and I thought they dealt with them in a great manner.

Every room has a hair dryer, but no iron and ironing board.  Safes in every room.  You will need an adapter for the outlets if coming from the US.  They did have Wi-Fi, but it was not always reliable.

Concierges were all fantastic.  Very helpful.  Main desk staff was okay, but not to the same level as the concierges.  Some of the front desk staff had very limited English, which was a surprise given the number of American tourists staying in the hotel, but we were able to communicate well enough.

There is a good coffee shop across the street to the right as you are leaving the hotel.  Very good espressos and bakery goods.

Overall good hotel, but not quite a 5 star, more like a 4 1/2.  The location alone would make me want to stay there again if we ever get back to Rome.",4,2015,07,12
01,5 Star - You have to be kidding,"This was the worst hotel I have been in.  We got there after traveling for over 3 hours in incredible heat.  When we got there we were brought to a room that looked like it had not been renovated since the 50s.  We were so disappointed as we had even upgraded our room here as this was the last leg of our trip and we wanted it to be special.  So we went down and asked for another room and they took us to a a nicer room that had been somewhat updated but the ac did not work.  So back again we went to the desk and they took us to a third room.  That was was perfect except for the fact that the the hall way smelled horribly, ac did not work the tv did not work and the toilet was broken and to top it off there were twin beds.  Great for an anniversary trip.  .

By this point, I called my travel agent and said GET ME OUT OF HERE!!! We had to stay one night there and then we moved to the Grand Palace up the road which was lovely.  

I will say that the location is fairly good and the view from the 7th floor is amazing but go for the view and leave .",2,2015,07,12
01,has all the ability to be 5 star but doesn't,"Beautiful hotel. Terrible desk service and drink service. 
Also very expensive breakfast that SUCKS. For 40 dollars a head cold eggs and soggy bacon are unacceptable. 
Across the street is a coffee bar that charges 1 euro for better cappuccino and breakfast pastries.",3,2015,07,11
01,"High expectations, but...","I really wanted to like this hotel but unfortunately the experience and service was poor.  Our initial rooms were extremely hot and though the hotel moved us to other rooms (we had two rooms) only one of them was (marginally) better than the first.  The AC system at the Bernini is poor so if that’s important to you in the hotter summer months you should know what to expect.  Other reviewers have spoken of discourteous staff and we experienced that as well except for one concierge (Dominic) who was fantastic. Otherwise, our experience was poor and we will not be going back to the Bernini.  There are moderately priced hotels in the area that treat you well and that actually have working air conditioning.",2,2015,07,11
01,Hardly 5 star,"Advertised as a 5 star and priced as such. Even simple spaghetti on the room service menu costed 20 euro. Air conditioning barely worked and even when sleeping on top of the sheets my wife and I were sweating through each night of sleep. Also, we paid for a king size bed which turned out to be two twins pushed together and made separately. Additionally, there was an odd odor of sewage in our 3rd floor hall and staff service was spotty. For instance, while the concierge was very helpful, when I asked for a water bottle at the front desk (after sweating through the previous night sleep) I was told to check my mini bar. Unacceptable at a ""5 star"" hotel. Good location and breakfast but overall disappointed.",3,2015,07,08
01,Great location,"The location of this hotel made it a great choice.  We were able to get on the Metro (subway) right outside the front door.  It was a quick walk to the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain.  We went on a City Wonders Tour and they met us right in front by the fountain.  We thought we might have dinner on the roof but after looking at the menu, it seemed quite pricey -overpriced.  We never saw anyone eating there.  The room we stayed in was spacious as was the bathroom.  The air conditioner worked okay but the room still felt quite warm.  I guess this is considered fairly typical of hotels in Italy.  Not a bad choice, again location is great.  ",4,2015,07,05
01,Caveat Emptor in Roma,"We passed by the Hotel Bernini on our way to dinner in the area and noticed the rooftop bar.  As we had time before our 9pm dinner reservation, we thought it might be worth checking out for a possible great view of the city. The bar area is located in the back (no view), while the sweeping vistas of Rome are reserved for the hotel's restaurant patrons - makes total sense.  Nevertheless, we took the obligatory photo from the restaurant section (which at 8pm on a Saturday night was devoid of customers) and sat in the lounge area for a drink. Ordered a Kir Royale and hub ordered a G&T.  My champagne cocktail was served in a chardonnay glass and tasted more like dubonnet with a spritz than champagne (or its middle-class cousin Prosecco) with Chambord.  When we settled up 30 minutes later, the tab was a somewhat startling 45 Euro.  Our mistake for not looking at the menu that our waiter offered up when we arrived.  Would have gladly paid that for a drink WITH the view, but for one without, I dub this the Rooftop Ripoff of Rome.",2,2015,07,05
01,Excellent Experience in the Heart of Rome,"My wife, son and I recently had the good fortune to spend four nights at the Hotel Bernini Bristol and it was a most enjoyable experience.  From the moment we checked in, the staff was attentive and responsive.  By our second day there, they were greeting us by name and welcoming us back from our expeditions.  All the members of the concierge staff did a fantastic job. For example, when we first arrived, we needed to have a Vatican tour set up for the following day, since the one we had originally booked for the day after that had been cancelled due to the Vatican being closed unexpectedly.  Not only did the concierge manage to get a tour booked for us, but when the guide took ill the next morning and could not make it, they found us a replacement guide for later that same afternoon. They were also spot on with their suggestions for local restaurants. Each evening they recommended a different place to eat in the area and each time the food and wine were very good at a reasonable cost.

We had a beautiful room on the seventh floor with a view of Piazza Barberini and the city of Rome beyond that. The space was clean and modern, with a comfortable bed and a reasonably comfortable cot for our son. There was a safe in the room, along with a coffee maker.  The bathroom had a built in blow dryer.  However, be aware that the hotel does not offer an iron and ironing board in room for safety reasons, so the only way to get your clothes pressed is to use the hotel laundry service or a laundromat down the street.

The hotel has a rooftop bar and restaurant, which has open air seating and offers beautiful views of the city.  Drinks are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected for the quality of the hotel and a rooftop location. It was worth the extra cost for the experience, We did not eat dinner in the restaurant, so we cannot be helpful with any feedback on that.

The location of the hotel was perfect for us. We walked everywhere we visited and most of the sites were within 10-20 minutes of the hotel.  The Pantheon and Spanish Steps were only a 10 minute walk (in different directions) and we made it to the Colosseum in less than 20 minutes. The longest walk was about 25 minutes to the Vatican, which was still quite pleasurable.,

We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Hotel Bernini Bristol and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent hotel experience in the heart of Rome.",5,2015,07,04
01,Great Rooftop view,"Great area.
Rooms are decent.
A/C not great. Room could get quite warm.
Staff/Service not 5 star calibre. I get Italian service attitude is different but there should be no excuses in a great hotel.
I don't understand how there is no in room tea or coffee capability in a supposed 5 star hotel.
Have a drink on rooftop but there may be better places to stay.",3,2015,07,01
01,snooty staff,In as few words was possible:  room ac was barely working.  TV had no reception Staff was testy when I called to complain regarding the room deficiencies.  The receptionist simply said we were told at check in that they were working on these problems. I did not recall her saying that and would have not stayed.   Someone came to adjust the thermostat for the ac but it didnot fix the problem. The Concierge was helpful with restuarant  recommendations but he too was a big arrogant with his answers. The breakfast was very good in the hotel restaurant.,2,2015,06,28
01,"Good location, but no true 5 star","This hotel offered great location. My boyfriend and myself walked everywhere. All of the top tourist attractions were very close.

The hotel was dated and beds were so uncomfortable. Worst bed I slept on during my whole Europe trip.

The staff wasn't super friendly. When we asked about restaurants, they pointed us to very touristy places. We were looking for authentic local food.

The in room dining was not good, but we loved to sit at the rooftop bar at the end of the night. Beautiful views of the circle with a pretty fountain. 

When looking for a true five star, look elsewhere.

",3,2015,06,26
01,Very good,"Excellent location. You can walk everywhere or use the train. Being from NYC, this train system is super easy to navigate but we also walked EVERYWHERE (and then trained home :) ).

The rooms are nice sized. The fitness/spa area is empty which is great. The restaurant on the roof has one of the best views and a great cacio e pepi. 

What's not to love?",5,2015,06,26
01,"High Expectations, Low Delivery","First impressions were great when we arrived at the hotel. The reception staff seemed efficient and friendly and we were checked in and into our room (405) quite quickly. All good so far and the view from our room overlooked the Piazza Barberini which was wonderful. We arrived at the hotel after 3pm and after spending the day travelling on 2 trains to get there then a taxi to the hotel, we were desperate for a cleansing shower. It took over 15 minutes (no exaggeration) for warm water to come through then probably another 5-7 for it to become hot. It may have just been a busy time for showers but not off to a good start. The wifi in our room was non existent unless you sat right up next to the door on the floor or on the couch outside the room in the foyer area near the lifts. Very disappointing and when mentioned it to the staff they didn't seem to care much saying that it was working elsewhere. The rooftop restaurant/bar, whilst affording some majestic views of the city and giving you views to magnificent sunsets, lacks on it's promised delivery. Whilst a great experience overall, we could not say it was as first class as we'd been led to expect. That said, the food was wonderful if a little overpriced but well worth paying, once. Breakfast on the other hand was fantastic. No excuse to go hungry with the array of food on offer and all very fresh. The availability of a pool was a little misleading in the photos as this is only attached to the Presidential suite and there is no pool available for the public to use. The gym equipment is adequate enough for a quick workout to keep all that pizza and pasta off the waistline. If you are a sound sleeper and traffic noise doesn't bother you then a street facing room should suit you. Also, if you have a connecting door to another room as part of your room, it may as well be open as it is not sound proof at all and all noises from the adjoining room can be heard. All that said, the hotel is clean and quite handy to all main sights in Rome with no more than 20-25 minutes walk in any direction required. I would recommend it, but not highly. For the per night rate we paid we expected a lot more.",3,2015,06,25
01,It's okay...,"I've stayed here on business a few times now. My company books me here. In fact, I'm writing this from my room at the Bernini. The BB has nice, if smallish, rooms. My room this time has two twins pushed together but made separately. Annoying to have two twins when a queen would fit just as well. The hotel has a pretty good location right on Barberini Plaza, which is also a busy and noisy traffic circle.
With a few rare exceptions, the staff can be cool and aloof...especially if you're not nicely dressed. The desk staff especially can be snippy. There is a nice but very overpriced restaurant and separate bar on the roof/top floor with a nice view. I found the food there average and the service slow. Breakfast buffet on the first floor is nice, but again the service is leisurely and haphazard...especially by American standards. The WiFi can be slow, spotty and is prone to disappearing altogether. 
The common lobby area looks nice but is not especially welcoming, and some of the furniture is well-worn with saggy leather chairs. Not really a great hotel for the kiddies.
This hotel brags 5 stars...I'd knock that down a star. The Bernini Bristol doesn't quite live up to it's billing.",3,2015,06,23
01,Not the best location and not very friendly,The hotel has nice rooms and appointments but lacks a good can do it attitude from the staff. We were there last week and food that the Internet was not working and the wifi was not working and were continually told that it was our phones and computer. When we went down to the front desk to complain it seems everyone else was being told the same thing. Not cool. The truth goes a long way.,3,2015,06,15
01,Perfect location with an amazing view & great staff,"I have to say this hotel was great and the staff was fantastic.  We stayed at this hotel during our trip to Italy with the idea to stay for 3 days then head to florence, but instead we ended up staying for the entire week after changing our room to the top suite.

We had reserved a deluxe room facing the Terrazza Barberini which was ok but we had wanted to face the Piazza instead.  Plus we had seen pool pictures and expected the hotel to have one,instead we found out that it was a presidential suite pool.  It was our kids birthday week and we wanted it to be special, when we talked to the front desk after one day the manager (i believe his name was Marco, sorry if I forgot it) he was very nice and understanding we explained that our expectations were for a pool and a Piazza view and that we would pay for the room upgrade.  The room was being used the first day but he was very kind and offered us the room after current occupants (some high ranking official of Panama). 

When we went into the room on our second night we immediately fell in love with the Terrace/Balcony and who wouldn't love having their own gym and pool on their patio.  We immediately went down stairs and reserved the room for the rest of the week.  I must say if you have a chance to reserve that room, its worth the extra money because you will spend a day just lounging outside and looking at the sunset behind the Vatican from a distance.  

The staff were extremely courteous, we were looking for a private tour of the Colosseum and the concierge was so great to recomend a tour guide that was amazing if we didn't mind paying a couple of bucks extra.  That was the best money i have ever spent, this young lady was so great that she came to our hotel and rode in the car explaining all the different places along the way.  When we got to the Colosseum we did not have to wait in lines (which were hours long) she went in with her accreditation and got us the tickets in 5minutes took us to Palatine hill and the roman ruins, she was so knowledgeable and so good with her english that we felt very lucky.  She had worked as an archeologist all over the world and she carried such a wonderful conversation thru out our tour.  When we got to the Colosseum entrance the line was wrapped around the building we didn't even have to wait.  We walked passed all these people and had another person join us that works in the Colosseum to provide us access to the Colosseum underground as well as the top of the  Colosseum, both areas that are closed off / gated to the public.  

The staff at Hotel Bernini Bristol had made this the greatest experience we have had. By the way, the breakfast was excellent and the wait staff was also wonderful. We will certainly come back, in fact we have told all our families and friends that this is the place to stay at in Rome.  If you can afford their top suite its worth every dollar.

The Hotel is 5 minute walk from the Spanish Steps, 10minute walk from Trevi fountain & Villa Borghese and many other hot spots.",5,2015,06,14
01,"Great location, beautiful hotel, however - reception had no record of our prepayment and erred with reservation","Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, expensive. We were expecting an exquisite experience and were disappointed at check-in when manager informed us he had no record of our prepayment and they had reservations for only 5 of our 6 family members. Our family of 6 had ordered 2 superior suites to accommodate 3 guests in each suite. Hotel had reservations for 2 suites to accommodate total of 5 guests. We had to present documentation of our electronic payment of reservations made five months earlier. Our first suite was situated on 1st floor and was beautifully decorated and spacious. However, air conditioning was not working properly - room was hot and we had to open up windows at night to cool off. Our second suite (for our children) was situated on 3rd floor - the second suite was considerably smaller and plainly decorated, however the air conditioning worked fine for 3rd floor suite. All in all it was a nice hotel located in convenient area of Rome that lacked attention to detail.",3,2015,06,11
01,Good stay in the right location ,A decent price for the value. The hotel is in a very good location. Insist on a suite and not the regular room. The view from the restaurant and bar on the roof is one of the most beautiful sites in the city. Next to the center of the city and far enough not to be in all the noise. ,3,2015,06,10
01,Good location,"The Berlini Hotel is ideally situated in Rome, the rooms are of a moderate size , clean and with all mod cons.
Breakfast was ok with adequate buffet with hot options.
There is a roof terrace bar and restaurant which is very nice,
A good place to stay when in Rome.",4,2015,06,08
01,A lovely old building,"This hotel has the location and the looks. The rooms are nice, but it had the hardest beds I have ever slept on anywhere! Mind you, others that were travelling with us didn't have the same problem. Breakfast was less than average.",4,2015,06,07
01,Some Poor service spoilt things a bit,"This hotel was picked for us by our Mediterranean cruise company, for a pre cruise stay of three nights.
The rooms are sumptuous, but lacking a bit of maintenance here and there... leaking toilet, a strange cord over the bath that turned out to be  a panic alarm & not the switch for the exhaust fan ( that didn't work anyway).
The roof top bar is great fun, but again the adjoining restaurant is sub let to outside caterers so you can't  eat restaurant food on the bar terrace & vise versa, which is a little annoying... so we eat out at good local restaurants.
Breakfast was good & plentiful.
The consierge was a little pedantic when we asked him to contact our airline for changes & this caused delays.
Overall a nice hotel but I am not sure that it is value for money",4,2015,06,06
01,Nice hotel,"This hotel would probably be considered a 3 1/2 star in the U.S., however it was nice.  The rooms were clean and the bathrooms are good sized.  The lobby was very nice.
We arrived around 11:30 am, and asked if a room was available.  The front desk said that it would be about an hour, so we left to go grab a bite to eat.  We were gone over an hour and a half, but a room was still not ready.  We were told it would be another 30-45 minutes.  We were so tired from our flight, but we left again to return after about 1 hour.  Our room was still not ready.
The front desk did not apologize,nor did they really acknowledge us after this.  We waited right in front of them on a lobby sofa, and my husband ended up falling asleep because it took so long.  Finally, after about 5 hours, we got a room.
Horrible front desk service, but the concierge was very good the next day.
Also, the breakfast buffet is incredibly expensive.  They should provide a complimentary continental breakfast like other Rome hotels do.
I probably would not stay here again, but the location is very good and in a nice neighborhood, with close proximity to subway.",3,2015,06,04
01,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights before heading out on our cruise.

The hotel was beautiful.  Our room, #502, had a balcony overlooking the fountain in the square and our bathroom had a window with gorgeous views.  With the bathroom window and balcony doors open, the Rome breezes flowed through our room. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were in walking distance to almost everything and when needed, there was a cab stand at the entrance.  The hotel was surrounded by cafes and restaurants as well as shops.

Service was outstanding. The room was on the smaller side but clean and comfortable.  

We opted for the hotel breakfast in our room charge and it was well worth it. A beautiful spread with fresh fruit & pastries as well as the usual breakfast buffet items.

Our only complaints were the free Wi-Fi that constantly required us to re-log in and the roof top restaurant was extremely expensive and service left a lot to be desired.

All in all, we would stay there again whenever in Rome.",5,2015,06,02
01,Reasonable but not 5 Star in my opinion,"I would say the usual with Italian Hotels, rooms quite dated, but the rest of the hotel is fine.  Breakfast is poor, probably best to go out for breakfast, but at least there is something there to eat before you set off on you site seeing trips if you want it.  Staff are friendly and helpful.",4,2015,05,28
01,WHEN IN ROME: HOTEL BERNINI BRISTOL,"Just returned from Italy- third stay at Bernini Bristol.No disappointments, as usual. Staff uniformly  friendly and attentive, facilities well-maintained. Great location at foot of Via Veneto, 10 min walk to Spanish Steps or Trevi Fountain (presently closed for repairs). Metro stop steps away. Breakfast wonderful in beautiful dining room, nice terrace bar on top floor.Will definitely return next visit to Rome.",5,2015,05,26
01,Nice Hotel but not Outstanding and Overpriced for what you get.,"Very nice hotel but nothing out of the ordinary. Very attentive & efficient staff and the daily breakfast was very good in a beautiful, well appointed dining room. Service was good as well. We had a standard room that was—well—very standard. Faux hard wood floors and an average bed. Sleep quality was adequate as the bed was a bit uncomfortable. You also hear a lot of noise from the outside so don’t count on sleeping in. Linens were of average quality. Bathroom was very small—not much room for toiletries. Small fitness center, adequate by 3 Star Hotel level by inadequate by 5 Star level. The roof top bar was nice but the area with the best views is for private parties or reserved for those with suites on the top floors so it was closed to the general public (or at least is was during our 3 night stay). The roof top bar is covered so it can be used when it’s raining however when it rains, the roof leaks in places (is this really a 5 Star Hotel?). The hotel is in a great location and dozens of nice, cozy restaurants are within walking distance. During our stay, we visited a few other 5 Star Hotels in the area & they appeared to be more elegant based on the public areas we saw such as the lobby and bar areas. The Bernini Bristol is nice—but would not consider it 5 Star. Overpriced for what you get.",3,2015,05,25
01,"Bernini, from barock to the present time.","You are living in the hart of Rome, overlooking Piazza Barberini with the impressive Triton fountain. You will find a very comfortable hotel with friendly and professional staff. The art and style of the whole interior (18th century) is like an island in the pulsating environment of the city.",5,2015,05,24
01,A five-star Rome property,"The 127-room Bernini, in the heart of Rome overlooking Piazza Barberini and the impressive Triton Fountain, (1642), has a great location and reflects the art and history of the area with rare 18th century tapestries and period furniture. Guests over the years include the Queen of England, Churchill, the Rockefellers, Woody Allen, and Mussolini during the World War II years. A huge bonus is Chef Andrea Fusco honored with a Michelin Star. His prestigious restaurant on the eighth floor with views forever is ranked among the best in Rome.",5,2015,05,22
01,Rome Gem,"This is a very comfortable hotel in a great location in Rome.  The rooms are a great size, comfortable beds, and nice towels.  The bathroom was large and had a bidet, and remember not to pull the cord in the bath tub since it's an alarm.  (Luckily, they call before they send in help.)

The front desk staff was helpful in terms of providing directions and assistance with check in.

For me, though, it is indeed about location.  It's right next to the Hop on, Hop Off bus as well as walking distance to the Spanish Steps and lots of shopping and restaurants.  I would stay here again.",5,2015,05,20
01,Magical Hotel,This is a 5 star hotel located in the centre of Rome. It is lavishly furnished in Italian Baroque style and offers comfortable and spacious accommodation.  It offers  rooftop drinks or dining at the O'limpo restaurant with stunning views over Rome. Dining there was a special experience which was complemented by the seamless service provided by the restaurant staff. An excellent breakfast was served on one of the lower floors which overlooked the Bernini fountain.  You cannot get better than this. This hotel surpassed our expectations and It also had WiFi that worked.,5,2015,05,18
01,Its all about the location,"This was our third stay at this hotel.  We keep coming back as the location can not be beat. Walking distance to the Spanish Steps, Via Condotti and even the Vatican if you have good shoes, not to mention the many Cathedrals housing remarkable art. Ah but to call this a five star hotel, I don't think so! Our upgraded room-bare floors-no carpeting (not unexpected from our prior stays). But the decoration, though clean and in good shape, was pure 1953 F.W. Woolworths from the white plastic headboard to the lamps and other furnishing. That the table lamp could not be shut off, (but was replaced) was one thing, but that the air conditioning throughout the hotel was broken for our entire three day stay was inexcusable. Otherwise, service was as expected in a good hotel property, breakfasts were fine and the staff was pleasant, responsive and helpfull.",4,2015,05,18
01,Best location ,Best location and class room i like it  and recommend it the staff was friendly the hall was nice and wounderfull location is 8 minute wake to spanish step and 10 minute wake to  fountana di Trevi، and also its in front of tour bus station also its 10 minute to vatican ,5,2015,05,17
01,Great location; Excellent Staff,"Lovely hotel with beautiful rooms and views. Staff exceeded expectations from front desk , to housekeeping, to engineering. Even minor problems taken care of immediately with courteous and helpful personnel. Bell Staff knowledgeable and friendly; Concierge superb and with a glorious sense of humor to boot! Rooms spacious and very well appointed. Location very convenient to resturants, shopping, Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, not to mention the ""step on, step off "" bus tours.",5,2015,05,14
01,Perfect location for walking around Rome,"We spent 3 days in Rome and the Bernini Bristol was the perfect location for us. East of the Spanish Steps, this location worked well for all the walking we did. We arrived by shuttle from the airport and we took a cab one morning to get to the Vatican tour at 9:15 AM. Other than that, we walked to everything; and we did as much as you could do in Rome in 3 days. The room was clean and comfortable. The shower and bathroom very nice. The breakfast that is included with the cost of the room was wonderful. Scrambled eggs, omelets, bacon, sausage, potatoes, hard rolls, meats and cheese, fresh fruit, sweet breads and croissants, juice, water, and coffee. If you are going to stay in Rome, I recommend this location!",5,2015,05,10
01,Decent but not a 5 star,"It's 32 degrees In Rome and the hotel has not turned the air conditioning on!  The system apparently takes time to start up-- the forecast has been accurate and we checked last week to see the warmer temps coming. Our hotel in Florence (also a Sina hotel ) was freezing but we could fully control the thermostat in our room. I have no idea why this hotel cannot get their system going earlier!!!  When I first asked for assistance, a lovely fellow showed up. He pulled the panel apart with his screw driver, flicked a few buttons, then said it was ""fixed "" (in Italian ). This was odd, as the front desk admitted there was no a/c!  They said it would be on by May 7th. It's May 8 and still no air. The gym is unbearable so not a great place for a workout. Also, a personal trainer is always there training clients who are not hotel guests so the rather small gym gets crowded.",3,2015,05,08
01,THE BEST,"lovely large room,big balcony with the best view of rome,on the 6 floor(gunior s. near the lift,also can be for 3 ).very good location,quiet eara. the best service,gave us a free upgrade. nice breakfast,free upgrad",5,2015,05,03
01,"Nice hotel, but lock up your valuables.","Spent four nights at the Bernini Bristol.  It was generally very good, but one afternoon we came back to the room to find the TV running (we never used it) and my wife's computer/tablet gone. Searched the room well and concluded that somebody with access to the room stole it. We immediately reported this to the management. They seemed flabbergasted and said it couldn't have been one of their employees. Their advice was that we go to the police and report it.

Now, since this is a hotel with card keys, they have a record of every time someone unlocks the door and who it was. The maids' keys carry codes that tell the hotel's computer who unlocked the room and when. The desk clerk indicated that they would check the record.

We were stuck there for two more days, but the hotel never bothered to inform us of what they discovered. 

The hotel does provide safes in the rooms. From then on we used it for almost everything other than clothes.",4,2015,05,01
01,Excellent location,"Stayed for one night on business. My room was overlooking the Piazza and was well appointed. One or two issues with the room i.e. no TV signal and stained toilet which was slightly surprising.  However, the hotel is well positioned to meet view the attractions of Rome. Breakfast was slightly disappointing with a limited choice.",4,2015,05,01
01,Fabulous location and great views from the rooftop restaurant,"We stayed for six nights, we were on the second floor and had a terrace with table and chairs.  The staff were very pleasant and the room very smart.  We got a complimentary bottle of wine on our first night.  Continental breakfast was excellent.",4,2015,04,28
01,Beautiful and Well Situated,"Lovely lobby and rooms.  It looks just like the photos; no surprises.  The room had lots of little extras like slippers and robes and a scale!  Fabric wall covering, like a palace.  And a private terrace too!  They were able to get us into our room before the usual check in time.  So we took off running with our sightseeing.  I was a little leary when they said the room was next to the elevator but we never heard it.  We didn't even hear it when we were in the hall waiting for it because it doesn't bing.  The front desk was very helpful every time we asked for assistance with anything (usually a Wifi problem).  There are lots of fantastic restaurants in the area and the Hop On Hop Off stop is across the street.  Really, everything is not far.  Absolutely great in every way.",5,2015,04,24
01,Old world hotel with great views,"I spent the past few days in the Hotel Bernini Bristol, the servce was great , the bed was super comfortable, t was quiet which considering the location was a surprise. The staff was excellent and very helpful. The breakfast was ok but I rarely find good breakfasts in Italy outside of some place like Bulgari Hotel... I had no complaints.",5,2015,04,23
01,a good hotel for walking lovers,"the hotel is located just near the metro line (Bernini station) the next station is ""spagna"" you can enjoy the historical spanish steps and the most luxurious shopping street Via Condotti ,a few stations after the Vatican and the ""castle of the holy angel"" and  within a walking distance is the ""fountain of four rivers"",and the previous station is Terminus station so you can change the line and go straight to Ancient Rome Colossus and the Forums.or simply you can abondon the mass transit system and get all these fabulous places visited on foot starting by Ancient Rome early morning and go to the castle and walk in Renaissance Rome in one day and grab a Gelato while walking late at night to go back to your comfortable warm  hotel.So,the location is unbeatable and the rooms are soundproof so don't mind the traffic noise which is non sense in fact.
the restaurant upstairs gives you a splendid view of Rome at night,the food is of good quality but this is regarding the in room dining but with those friendly restaurant staff i easily got the royal treat i deserve ;-) the menu goes upstairs especially for me to choose and special chef recommendations and you can ask for whatever that suits you so they can make it specifically for you.
the concierge and checking in and out experiences were very nice and especially when the young gentleman at the concierge made the local tourist office (whom provided me a day trip outside Rome) to come pick me as i am a very important guest and a one who should not be missed with (and they swallowed the bait and provided me with a private transfer from the hotel and back too!!
The WIFI is average regarding speed and it needs frequent signing in.
the room sizes are average with big bathrooms but a little bit small shower area",5,2015,04,02
01,"Beautiful hotel, great service, perfect location.","This is a beautiful hotel, set in the perfect location, not only within walking distance of the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, but also has metro, bus and taxi links within a few steps on Piazza Barberini.  The entrance to the hotel is beautiful, as is the bar and surrounding seating area.

We were very kindly upgraded to a beautiful suite on the 7th floor, which was very comfortable, clean and afforded us amazing views over Rome. The Italian marble bathroom was nice, and the kingsize bed was very comfortable. In my view, the room was very fitting of a 5* hotel, and we also had complimentary bathrobes and slippers and plenty of soft, clean towels.  We overlooked the lovely fountain on Piazza Barberini, but at night, although this area is busy, our room was very quiet.

We used the breakfast room for the first two mornings of our stay, which we found to be a pleasant room.  The breakfast is buffet style, with plenty of selection, from cereals, fruit, cold meats and cheese, lots of bread rolls, croissants, brioche, and flan, as well as bacon, sausage, potatoes, tomatoes, and omelet and scrambled or fried egg.  The staff were helpful and we were served quickly with our coffee.  My only comment would be that the scrambled egg and bacon I had on the first morning and the omelet (no bacon available) on the second morning were cold.  The hotplate servers just don't do their job in keeping the food hot.  

For the other three days of our stay, we paid an extra €12 per day, to have breakfast delivered to our room.  The first morning was perfect, with the continental breakfast choice, with a good selection of jams and spreads.  On the second morning, they delivered breakfast for one, instead of two, but a quick call to the breakfast room, and the guy was back to our room with the extras within five minutes.  On the third morning, they forgot the toast we asked for, but there was so much in the 'bread' basket that we didn't need the toast.  Overall, we were impressed with everything including the staff, especially Robert.

We mentioned at the reception desk that we wanted to turn down the heat in our room.  Almost as soon as we got back to the room, an engineer was there to show us how to control the heating.  We found the service from all the staff we encountered to be exceptional.  The doorman, Mario was very nice and helped us with our Italian pronunciation. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, and we were made to feel very welcome and like nothing was too much trouble.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the front office manager, Marco, and also Roberto, who were keen to know that we had enjoyed our stay. 

I cannot recommend this hotel enough, and we very much look forward to staying here again in the future.",5,2015,03,24
01,Rome and rugby,"First time for me in the Bernini and an ideal place for walking around Rome. Lovely facilities although the bar in the lobby was not often manned.
The highlight was Stefano on the door....what an asset he is to the hotel, so knowledgable and helpful.",4,2015,03,24
01,Terribly unimpressed... and booked by Amex,"Tough experience in this hotel, could be bad luck, could be they're just not that good. Arrived sleep deprived with my family of four... my travel agent had asked for an early check-in. Was told there was nothing available, we'd just have to wait in the lobby. Son fell asleep on the sofa, wife the same, eventually they found a room for us to sleep in for the 2 hours until our rooms were ready.
Heat was still on in the hotel and we were on the top floor so rooms were incredibly hot. Called the desk and was informed there was nothing they could do... oh well, windows stay open. Bathroom in room 715 stunk... called the desk again, tried but nothing they could do... oh well. Bedrooms requested were for a connecting king or queen and two twins in other... beds in both were two twins pushed together?
Sleep during the night was tough with sounds of the street in our rooms, (not a sensitive crowd, we live in NYC).
Breakfast at the hotel was not so good, service really non existent.
Front desk staff was lovely, but not very effective.
Had a tour guide come early one day, supposedly ask for us in the lobby and was told we were not there. When we got back and asked if anyone had been looking for us, were told no one was there all morning?
Wish I didn't have to recount all the misses, but I was really, really disappointed in how these guys conducted themselves. I'd like to say bad luck on our part, but too many misses to be coincidence.
Think you can find a better stay when in Rome...",2,2015,03,23
01,"Lovely for Location and Service--but not really ""Luxury""","We booked with our BA flights and found the reviews below were largely accurate.  

While we're not sure this hotel fully deserves its SLH membership, we found the location ideal for full days of wandering on foot, getting to Roma Termini, the Vatican, Colosseum, Capitolio, Cathedral of Rome.  If you don't feel like walking there is a taxi rank and Metro station on the square--and getting back to Barberini is a breeze.  

The staff were charming and helpful, recommending restaurants, logistics, walking vs taxi-ing, and providing map and directions.  

Our room was reasonable, but perhaps in need of a little TLC.  The shower far from luxurious--a bathtub with a swinging half-screen, which leaves the entire bathroom flooded after even the tidiest bather.  The room also needs a proper king-sized bed.  (For the life of me I can't figure out why European hotels pretend that pushing two twin mattresses together and tossing a sheet over them equals a king. It does NOT and it makes for awkward snuggles with your partner when one of you falls into the gap!!!  This does NOT feel luxurious!!!)  

Our main disappointment was the rooftop restaurant:  the food was decidedly average, the service disjointed and the price unjustified.  Even with the 15% discount we found it excessive--and we really don't mind paying for a nice meal.  

On the whole, a pleasant stay.",4,2015,03,18
01,Amazing overall!,"We arrived very early in the morning and were quickly accommodated in an upgraded room by Alessandra. Room was perfect, everyday, turndown service was just right. Daily breakfast is well worth it, and Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was very good. Perfect location in Piazza Barberini, will definitely stay here again!! Ciao!",5,2015,03,18
01,Good hotel in Rome,Really enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Bernini in Rome.  The location is great for restaurants and access to the metro is very close.  The room was perfect and was cleaned early each day.  The breakfast was excellent and the cafe' was delicious.  I didn't eat in the hotel restaurant on the top floor but did have a drink on the terrace.  The view is wonderful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Rome.,5,2015,03,08
01,Fabulous Hotel,"The Bernini is fabulous and in a great location! I've stayed in many hotels in Rome and this stay has been by far the best. The staff and services are beyond excellent. They are extremely welcoming, friendly and bend over backwards to help their guests! The front office manager, Marco treated us on March 8th, Women's day, to an Italian tradition of giving ladies Mimosa flowers to recognize the special day. The Bernini has an incredible roof top deck and restaurant that over looks the piazza. Cannot say enough good things about this hotel. My friend and I being young travelers are not always treated with respect but at the Bernini we were treated like queens and will be sure to stay again next time we visit to Rome!",5,2015,03,08
01,Nice place,"very well worth being a 5 star hotel...location is great, you can take the train from Airport to right outside of the Hotel enterance...I would strongly suggest this Hotel... rooms are a good size and very clean...",4,2015,03,02
01,A few steps out of Barberini Station,Quiet a few steps when you get out of the station. Kind and warm staffs. A chain of Small Luxury Hotels.,4,2015,02,27
01,Review of  Hotel Berini Bristol,"We stayed at Hotel Berini Bristol just for 1 night as we wanted to celebrate valentines in Rome (and do something extra special as we’re 20 years together this year)
Landing in Rome the train to the central station is €14 + €2 agency fee, then It’ll be €1.50 each two stops on the metro (and the metro station ‘Barberini’ is right outside the hotel), but for €30 we were able to get a private transfer in the arrivals hall at the airport, (although only saving €2 it more about saving the hassle of public transport and saving time).
I did contact the hotel a couple of days before to see if they could do anything special for our celebrations and the free upgrade and bubbles were very nice and was appreciated.
Check-in was very easy and straight forward, the lady on reception was very welcoming and polite, giving us a map and wifi passwords and information on the area.
Our room was located on the 3rd floor (Room 304), there are x2 spacious lifts up to the rooms and are quick. 
Upon entering the room to the left was a very clean bathroom, which had ample complimentary toiletries, numerous towels, x2 bathrobes, plenty of room for storing toiletries, a sink, shower and bath. 
In the bedroom area there was an electronic safe, storage for x2 suitcases, a fridge with a stocked mini bar, a nice sized closest for hanging our clothes, as with most hotels in Italy there no Tea / Coffee making facilities. The room was also very clean.
Also in the room was a flat screen TV, a work station, seating area / coffee table which was next to the window with a fantastic view overlooking the fountain in the square. 
The bed was amazing! It was so nice comfy and they had also provided the extra x2 pillows that I'd requested. 
The Air con also worked perfectly! 
The wifi is complimentary for x4 devices; if you require more devices to be connected you have the option to purchase a premium pack, it’s also fast!
The roof top bar / restaurant was an ideal place to go for late night cocktails (from €15 each) overlooking the city, the cocktails and nibbles were delicious! 
The room, the hotel was perfect and did exactly what we wanted it for!
The location couldn't be better, this was our third time in Rome, granted this visit was short, but this is the hotel for us for future visits to Rome – It’s perfect!",5,2015,02,18
01,THE BEST IN ROME,"Recommended by my niece who is an international flight attendant.  Great location in proximity of many sights.  Great shopping and eateries within a block.  Very attentive staff and friendly.  The room was perfect!  Clean, upscale and very comfortable.  Room service food is delicious but I wasn't there to eat in my hotel room.  The lobby bar and area are classy and convienent.  I will stay here  when in Rome, no other place.  I highly recommend the Hotel Bernini.  It's also a prestigious landmark too.",5,2015,01,30
01,Magical Three Days,Centrally situated near the Via Veneto and The Spanish Steps this gem of a Hotel has everything for the discerning traveller. The Roof Top Restaurant and Bar have breathtaking views of the city. Our luxury room on the fourth floor at the front of the hotel overlooked Barbareni Square and was delightfully furnished with baroque style furniture. The newly refurbished room featured an ensuite marble bathroom complete with jacuzzi bath and was immaculate. Breakfast was a cornucopia of culinary delectation elegantly presented and staff could not do enough for us. Reception helped us to book restaurants and a visits to museums. Nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel welcome. There was also a spa which we did not use. A truly 5 Star Luxe establishment - yes a bit expensive but you get good value for money. Would highly recommend this Hotel.,5,2015,01,09
01,terrible,"It's terrible experience in hotel. The room is spacious, view and location are excellent.
But the service is terrible.
First, the staff entered our room after 10:00 pm. I and my husband were really surprised and waked up!! we didn't heard any sound and knock.
Second, we asked hot water in front. Front gave me a number for room service, and then we called there ourselves. But the staff ""if you want hot water, you come ****(I didn't heard exactly where)."" I didn't understand why I call again for room service, why I go to there for hot water,  especially 5 star hotel!!
I didn't think this hotel isn't 5 star. I recommend you look after another good hotel.",1,2015,01,08
01,Room With a View,"While we did not stay at this hotel, our tour made it's dining room a stop for lunch. Fabulous food as well as the view several floors high. Everything was served perfectly, even for those that had food allergies. The dining room appointments were such that we felt we were at a wedding reception. Well done Hotel Bernini.",5,2014,12,24
01,Memorable stay for first trip to Italy,"Traveled to Italy with my Father and stayed at this hotel. I researched several and made the right decision! The location was absolutely perfect! It's also situated right on a square so doesn't feel as congested as other areas. It's well within walking distance to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Villa Borghese, as well as tons of restaurants and shops. We arrived and were greeted by helpful staff who stored our bags while we went off to explore. Once we checked-in, we had more time to see the property. The rooms are a fine size with marble bathrooms. The feel is definitely on the traditional side. The rooftop restaurant/lounge with views of St. Peter's is by far the most memorable feature of the hotel! We spent afternoons there relaxing after sightseeing and a couple of nights for dinner. I must say, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience.  I'm surprised by the negative reviews because our stay was the opposite. In fact, my Father still talks about it! I would most definitely return and recommend.",5,2014,12,22
01,"As a five start hotel, somewhat disappointing","The hotel is in a great location.  However for the price, the room was small, the bed uncomfortable and the carpets stained--it was not a five star experience.  The staff was helpful, but not overly helpful.",2,2014,12,15
01,Hotel Bernini Bristol,"Protests outside, buffet breakfast depleted by 9:00 am, concierges helpful. After returning to the states, I realized that we were charged more than we were told . We faxed the hotel, asking for a response. Nothing happened. We then called the hotel, and we're promised they'd look inti it, and get back to us. That was a month ago, and we've heard nothing.",3,2014,12,06
01,Disappointing,"Recently stayed at the Hotel Bernini in Rome for one night pre - cruise. Having read lots of positive comments on trip advisor, we were looking forward to our stay.  On arrival, there were no bell men or hotel porters for assistance.  Unfortunately our taxi driver was quite old and was unable to help us with our luggage.   We struggled with the doors and the steps.  There were 3 staff members standing behind reception chatting and seemed unaware of our arrival and our plight.
Our room was very basic but clean, and considering how much we were charged for that room through a major cruise company, we were very disappointing.  We made do for one night. Service in the roof top bar was very slow; we ordered x 2 Baccardi rum and coke and you could not taste or smell any alcohol.  For 15 Euros a shot, it was a very expensive coke!!!!!!. Breakfast was plain and simple; nothing to write home about.
Overall, the only thing going for this hotel is its locality.",2,2014,11,23
01,"Beautiful, somewhat expensive hotel, but worth a visit","Very beautiful rooms, a rather small bathroom, very vomfortable bed. Breakfast perhaps expensive but very complete. Great location, not really at a footstep from the main attractions, but Trevi Fountain, Pantheon etc are a 15 minute (beautiful) walk away. And staff will do everything to help you find your way in Rome.
Not the cheapest hotel, but certainly worth considering for a stylish and comfortable stay!!",4,2014,11,17
01,Wonderful hotel in great location!,"Just completed 4 nights at the Bernini Bristol and this is a wonderful hotel, centrally located to just about everything you want to do.  The rooftop bar/restaurant is outstanding.  Had a minor glitch with initial,room, but swift action by staff remedied the situation promptly.  Kudo's to Marco for his effort.  Had issue with my IPad and Wifi and concierge was extremely helpful to point he called company directly to get me back on line.  Couldn't be happier with hotel!",5,2014,10,27
01,A Classic Hotel,"My wife and I stayed six nights at the Bristol in September and found it to be a charming and classic European hotel.
The lobby is very welcoming and there are many comfortable places to relax throughout.
The staff speak English very well and several other languages, no doubt.
The location is ideal.  Piazza Barberini is pretty in and of itself.  Metro is steps from the front door.  Some great sites are within 10-15 minutes walk, including Piazza Spagna and Trevi fountain.  The via Veneto is a nice walk. 
Taxis are generally available immediately in front as well.
The concierge provided recommendations to two excellent restaurants in the area and made reservations as needed.
The bellman in the lobby was a delightful man.
Our room was well-appointed as was the bathroom.  Room maids took good care of us and provided turn-down each evening.
About the only issue we noted was we never took breakfast at the hotel, as it sounded rather expensive and there are numerous coffee shops around the piazza.",4,2014,10,26
01,superb location,"We booked this hotel for its location and supposed luxury.  The reception and concierge staff were first rate, as were the chambermaids, our room was serviced twice a day and we had clean bedding each day, lovely.  The hotel situation is great, on the piazza barberini so only a 10 minute walk to either the Trevi fountain or the Spanish Steps.  All the open top bus tours stop right outside the hotel so that was very handy.  The hotel was busy whilst we were there as it was the Rome film festival but that gave the place a nice buzz.  Our only niggle was the breakfast set up.  As they advertise not only a continental breakfast but also an 'American' style one they could do with finding out what it should consist of.  The omelettes were all kept warm as were the 'over' fried eggs and the scrambled ones as well.  Who wants tepid, long cooked eggs.  The ham was dreadful.  The first day it was burned black, what self respecting chef would send out food that was burned.  My husband pointed this out to the restaurant manager and he commented that it was crisp, I presume this was meant sarcastically.  The cheese and ham section never seemed to be replenished so if you didn't have an early breakfast you didn't get any,  likewise the fruit  replenishment seemed a little random,  it's only tinned fruit so sit's not difficult. The service was not really 5 star standard, very slow and at times a little begrudging.  We asked for poached eggs, they came either rock solid or liquid and every time cold.  Masses of choice of cakes and pastries though if you like that sort of thing for breakfast.  Altogether we had a lovely room, spacious, comfortable and quiet even though it was at the front of the hotel, and, apart from the breakfast staff, all the other staff were most helpful and charming.",4,2014,10,26
01,Great location,"My husband and I stayed here in September for 3 nights and over all we enjoyed this hotel, our room was lovely, a good size with a great view over the piazza. Location is excellent its within walking distance of Trevi fountain and plenty bars and restaurants, the tour buses stop right next to the hotel so all the tourist sights are within easy reach..Breakfast was good with plenty of choice but a little slow at bringing out fresh food.. My only complaint would be the rooftop bar when we went for a drink before going out we were ignored by most of the waiters going past who seemed to be only interested in those eating dinner so maybe avoid if you are after a quick drink!",4,2014,10,22
01,5 Star hotel?,"Going to Rome for a long weekend with my mother and brother, I wanted a nice hotel for us to stay in, which was also well located for sightseeing. I got the good location. 
The reception and seating area is very grand and very impressive. I wish my room was down there. But unfortunately, we had to take a lift up to find some pretty run down halls and rooms.
Rooms are small and could use a brush up. A lamp was not working. 
Breakfast is a buffet with a variety of options, so you help yourself. Coffe the waiter will bring you -If they don't forget, as they did with us half of the times.
The restaurant at the top of the hotel isn't too bad and has a stunning view. If you want a view at dinner time, and don't feel like going out looking for it, the restaurant at the top of the hotel is acceptable.",3,2014,10,11
01,Nice,"I suggest you request a room that has been recently updated. 
New rooms are ok and modern with large bathrooms by European standards. 
Breakfast is standard fare, buffet style. Nothing worth writing home about. 
A mixup occurred during my visit where my luggage was removed from my room without my knowledge after my travel long friends requested a room change. Mixing up our rooms occurred while we were out for the day. After some anxious moments my luggage was recovered by the staff but its removal was a bit unprofessional in its handling. Mgmt didn't offer any explanation. ",4,2014,10,06
01,A Wonderful Place To Stay,"We found The Bernini Bristol to be wonderful! Quiet,clean and classy. The location was within easy walking distance to many of the popular sights, bus, metro and restaurants galore! The room was very roomy for two and the bed was large and comfortable. Bathroom was a little small, but no smaller than in NYC hotels! The housekeeper freshened up room twice a day with pillow chocolates each night. Breakfast buffet was plentiful each morning with eggs, fruit, breads, meats and cheeses. Suggestions from front desk staff were helpful. Overall very classy and would stay here again!",5,2014,10,05
01,A Little Bit of Bernini in My Life,"The hotel was the first hotel I stayed at in a trip up the boot of Italy. The hotel was cute with a tiny elevator that goes to all the floors. It doesn't look like much, but on the inside the hotel is very well kept and our room was heavenly. The beds were very comfortable and a haven for us travelers after a very long flight from California.

All around us is the bustling city of Rome, we had traditional pizza nearby and gelato down the street. It was occasionally hard to find someone who worked at the hotel if we needed service for something, but in the end when we did receive help the people who worked there were often friendly and very hospitable. Even the food at the hotel for breakfast was to die for. The Italians really know how to show foreigners a good time!",4,2014,10,05
01,A Great Older Hotel,"This hotel is one of the Grand Dames of Rome. It is ideally located for walking most of Rome. Not far from the Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Piazza Navona  etc.
The staff and is very knowledgeable about distances to places and restaurants.",5,2014,10,04
01,"Great hotel, lukewarm service.","My partner and I stayed one night at The Bernini Bristol after an electrical fault meant our original choice of hotel was unavailable. In one single night we could see that this was a establishment with excellent standards. The room was impressive, the breakfast spectacular, the location wonderful and the fixtures and fitting were classy. The only sour note was the very indifferent service we received at reception. The contrast with the friendly, warm welcome we got from our other hotel was quite stark. Maybe it was the conclusion that a single night stay did not warrant any investment of effort but it's the sort of thing that gets remembered, despite all the good things about this hotel.",4,2014,09,25
01,Weekend Getaway,"This Hotel was great, people/staff very nice and helpful... the hotel is clean and very well worth being a 5 star hotel...location is great, you can take the train from Airport to right outside of the Hotel enterance...I would strongly suggest this Hotel... rooms are a good size and very clean...",5,2014,09,25
01,Bernini Bristol Experience,"The Hotel has been updated. As usual the rooms are small, but very nice and new. The Wireless works well, as does the plumbing and tv. 
Roof top restaurant and bar is very nice with good service.
The staff is helpful and welcoming.

The location and the Hotel are perfect for Rome.",4,2014,09,20
01,Beautiful rome,"We were lucky enough to stay at this perfectly located hotel twice this year .  Rooms are adequately furnished and very clean.  The hotel is perfectly located for walking to all the wonderful sights and great shopping area.  Drinks can be enjoyed on the beautiful rooftop with great views over Rome.  
Reception and door staff are very helpful.  ",4,2014,09,11
01,Decent hotel with a good location,"The hotel is decent with nice staff and a great roof top. The location is good with a lot of stuff near by and in walking distance. Always a lot of taxis outside and a cool fountain view.

The rooms definitely need a refurb and are old but not broken or disgusting. Just dated and could definitely do with new furniture and an update to the design of the bathroom. The views are good from the rooms and have big windows and lots of light. The bathroom even has big windows.

The roof top bar and restaurant has incredible views and very attentive staff. The menu is very limited for vegetarians. There's a good cocktail menu and it's very relaxing up there. Definitely worth checking out if you stay there.

The hotel doesn't strike me as a true 5* hotel - with it being old and dated and there's just certain things it misses in the service (however the service is definitely not poor, but it's definitely not the Four Seasons or Mandarin service either). Given the price through priceline it's definitely great value though.",4,2014,09,07
01,Service and and great food,"The Bernini is a great hotel that really tries to make one feel at home. The staff are always smiling, they are multilingual and they are always trying to assist you. The rooms are a good size, quiet, with very efficient AC, the bed is very comfortable and the room is actually dark of a night. The internet is free, easy to logon to and reasonably fast. The roof top restaurant is magnificent while breakfast is a feast.

Surrounding the hotel are numerous bars and restaurants all worth a visit, transport is immediately avaiable.",5,2014,09,04
01,Birthday long weekend celebration,"I booked this hotel with kirker holidays for a long weekend for my wife and 2 of her friends. The 2 friends were celebrating their birthdays. They went weekend of 4th august.

The hotel was quaint and beautiful. The staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly.  They has dinner in the hotel roof top restaurant - fabulous views of the city including the Vatican. 

The hotel is centrally located and excellent access to tourist sites.

My wife said they all had a great time and highly recommends the hotel.  You will not be disappointed! 
",5,2014,08,28
01,If you have the money this is the place to stay,"Outstanding hotel in the center of everything to see in Rome.  Service is excellent and the people were friendly.  You can walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain (though it will be under renovation for at least a year), Campo Di Fiori, Pantheon, and almost around the corner is the Capuchin Crypt. You cannot go wrong with using the local restaurants as it is impossible to get a bad meal. A drink on the roof top terrace at night is not to be missed.",4,2014,08,27
01,Fabulous and unforgettable stay !!,"Myself and my partner stayed here over the bank holiday weekend and can not speak highly enough of the Bernini. From the warm friendly welcome, to the fabulous concierge who went out of his way every day to help us with recommendations , taxis etc etc nothing was enough for them. The room was lovely and we had an amazing view of bernini square. The roof top terrace was a really amazing way to admire the views in fabulous chic surrounding's. I massively recommend this hotel in Rome for anyone wanting a centrally located , beautiful hotel !!! Lisa & James",5,2014,08,27
01,Very disappointing!!,"Let me begin by saying the the hotel is VERY well appointed, the location is fabulous, situated on Piazza Barberini and a stones throw from Trevi fountain (which) was under repair and the Spanish steps, which fountain was also under repair, 4 stops by metro to Vatican City and 8-10 minute taxi ride from many must see sites.
We arrived ready and waiting on baited breath to be mesmerized by the grandeur, ambiance  and opulence of the Bernini, but the balloons were quickly deflated. The air conditioner did not work our entire stay. The staff did send a workman up who turned the system off and on daily to no avail, it was an insulting rouse to appear as though they were doing everything they could, (except actually decreasing the room temperature) knowing full well that was it!  It was oppressive  sitting in the room, it was warmer in our rooms then outside.  The staff recommended we keep the windows opened which only facilitated in frustration from the alley noise.  
The rooms; average, we asked for adjoining rooms months prior but upon arrival they looks at us as though we had 2 heads. 
The bathrooms: in need of updating, the towel warmer did not work, the toilet ran incessantly.
The towels, robes and slippers were not the plush as expected but a little scratchy and over washed.
Maria, was one bright spot.  She was very helpful in guiding us around the city via metro and taxi.  She was also very articulate explaining to us why the maintenance person opened our safe deposit box when a guest complained that she could not gain access to it.
The remainder of the staff was courteous but not engaging; the night  staff was usually abrupt and spoke only if necessary for survival.
Breakfast was plentiful and enjoyable.
The rooftop terrace was a very nice way to end an evening admiring the sunset.
all bing said this is NOT a small fine hotel establishment, maybe it was in its heyday not it is not longer.  The staff tried best they could but there really is little to be done except a complete over hall  of what used to be a grand hotel.",3,2014,08,25
01,great 43rd wedding anniversary,"We were made to feel very welcomed... arriving at 7 am...too early for check in we went to breakfast area and we had coffee and a great view of the city... when we left the staff said welcome and enjoy your stay... buffet breakfast was served each day with a 'good morning' plenty of coffee & excellent service and always a smile ! The room was excellent.. very clean and pretty reliable internet access.. the hotel is located in a great area.. easy access to public transportation, taxis & walking to all major sites ( Colosseum, Trevi, Spagna Sq & Spanish Steps, Jewish Ghetto) .. A key reason we would return to Bernini bristol & recommend to friends is the exceptional help provided by concierges ( Umberto & Nicola) who also had a map to show us how to find a site..find a restaurant & travel on the subway! Also, the staff including Maumno & Ilariai were helpful with daily requests such as where is the ATM! We were never made to feel we were imposing on their time & everyone offered support and a good morning!",5,2014,08,24
01,Fantastic,"A high class quality hotel which is situated in a lovely central position. The decor is opulent and ambience outstanding . Staff exceptional as is the service and experience. A wonderful treat for my husbands birthday from our Italian friends.

01,Honeymoon in Rome,"We stayed for 10 nights in August & could not have asked for a better honeymoon hotel. Ideally located, clean, beautiful, classy and with staff who could not have been more helpful. Spending an evening on the rooftop terrace watching the sun go down over St Peters would make anyone's holiday complete. Would recommend to anyone, thank you again and we will be back!",5,2014,08,11
01,"Great Location, good rooms","The Bernini Bristol is situated on Piazza Barberini and 10-30 min walking distance to a lot of must-see venues in Rome, such as Via Veneto, Trevi, Colosseum & Spanish Steps. Rooms are good, breakfast is 3 stars and the staff was pretty nice, except for the head concierge who insisted on arranging a taxi to the cruise port at twice the price we found ourselves in the street.  We are fortunately very savvy and knew that the price he quoted was exhorbitant so we did what we had to do and got your own taxi! For men, there is a small men's clothing shop 200 meters away on the blvd right in front of the hotel with fabulous men clothing at excellent prices! Enjoy!!",4,2014,08,09
01,Brilliant location !,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights in the deluxe room with our own little balcony. The room was beautiful and the balcony was a great little touch. The bathroom was a little bit dated and could do with a bit of a revamp. However, this didn't cause us any trouble. Housekeeping was good -twice a day to clean the room. However, I would expect wine glasses to be replaced or cleaned as well as the balcony area swept as there were a few cigarette butts. These are minor issues which with a little bit more attention could easily be rectified but for a 5 star hotel commanding around £250 a night small touches would make a big difference. Breakfast was really good and the roof top terrace was very nice. In terms of location I don't think you can beat it very close to everything and the metro. Also reception and the porters were very helpful and polite. Overall a very nice hotel and would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2014,08,07
01,Hotel Bernini Bristol made our Rome experience unforgetable,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Bernini from July 18 to July 22 while on a family trip with my brother's family. We were not able to stay at the same hotel as my brother and his family as that hotel was full. The travel agent booked us at the Hotel Bernini and we were the lucky ones! The hotel is classy, well located and efficiently run. We loved the rooftop restaurant and ate there three times. Breakfast was beautifully presented and well served. Most importantly, the front desk staff and the concierge staff were the most talented and caring people we've ever dealt with at a hotel. Our luggage was inexplicably and inexcusably ( sorry, Luftstansa)  missing for three days. The staff did everything they could possibly do to track the luggage down; they constantly monitored the baggage web site and called the service numbers repeatedly, since we don't speak Italian. They were overjoyed when our luggage finally arrived This is service above and beyond. I would recommend getting at least a junior suite. Italian hotel rooms are usually small and the junior suite was a double size room and has the wonderful luxury of two bathrooms! High up is great and sacrificing the view is worth having the room be quiet. If our journeys bring us back to room we will definitely return to the Hotel Bernini.",5,2014,08,03
01,The Best Experience in Rome - Great Location!,"Arriving to the area I visualize the hotel in a great open area, a beautiful square with a marvelous fountain, what a great setting...once checked in I felt like having some champagne to celebrate the arrival..well, the top terrace is an elegant and incredible views of the whole city...

Its right in the middle of Fontana de Trevi and Spanish Steps, so you can walk to either in less than 10 minutes (on my way to Piazza Spagna there is a little Opera house, I recommend that experience also).

The staff is great, from the concierge (that will tell you some secret places to visit) to the front desk and Management. 

The breakfast is very nice, all options, Mimosas non-stop, and a wonderful spectrum of pastries and toasts..

The Spa is great for this type of trip where you try to visit everything and then you need a nice Jacuzzi and massage. :) 

Definitely this will be a repeat hotel when I come back to this incredible city. 
Great job Team!
Thanks",5,2014,07,22
01,"A memorable stay- an impeccable, gracious Concierge","We stayed in Rome from July 7-July 10. We had previously been in Venice and Florence. The hotel was quite nice; luxurious, clean rooms (great bathroom with an American style shower) and a wonderful buffet breakfast each day. We celebrated our anniversary at their rooftop restaurant, dining with a spectacular view of the Vatican at sunset. It was also in a convenient location for sightseeing. If these were all the comments we had, it would be a great review. However, what made this stay truly exceptional was the Head Conceirge ""Max"".I was experiencing cellphone difficulties trying to arrange a conf call back to the US. Max spent an hour with us patiently working thru the problems with AT&T etc, until successful in establishing a connection. He did this while seamlessly helping other hotel guests. Max was also a great resource for restaurants, shopping and directions. He made an already great stay even more memorable.",5,2014,07,20
01,These people know how to run a hotel,"A wonderful experience overall.  Great location, beautiful rooms, staff were outstanding - couldn't do enough for you.  Felt very welcome and an especially nice hotel to return to after a day of sightseeing.  Excellent breakfast.",5,2014,07,19
01,Not quite a five star hotel,"We stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol following a Mediterranean cruise. We had payed a significant surcharge for a centrally located five star hotel.

The room was excellent, clean, well equipped, very comfortable bed and a small terrace. Free Wifi was also very welcome as most hotels still seem to sting you for this as an extra.
It was looking a bit tired though, one of the lifts wasn't working and the other two sounded like they might be due for a breakdown.

Where the hotel fell down was with the breakfast service. Tables were not laid up although the restaurant did not appear busy, service was slow - you needed to chase someone to get a cup of coffee, dirty plates were not cleared and hot food was not replaced as needed. The staff just didn't appear interested. 

But saying this the reception and concierge staff were excellent.",3,2014,07,18
01,"Nice for shopping, far from main attractions","I stayed here for a week then moved closer to Pantheon to better investigate that area as was tired to go up the hill after every walk. Hotel is nice, with good restaurant and swimming pool but some rooms facing the street are nosy at night and some bathrooms with window are cold. For shopping is very good located. Spanish staircase is also nearby. A lot of tasty restaurants around, although not cheap.",5,2014,07,06
01,Another Great Stay at Bernini Bristol,"This was our second visit for four days, same as last time.  We enjoy the staff and rooms.  The rooftop restaurant is outstanding!  We've had Fabrizio most times and he is the star server, with enjoyable presence and wonderful touches with the meal.  (The one night he wasn't there had slow service due to a full house and less experienced staff.)  The location is terrific, with close proximities to many sights, easy access to the metro or train station, and walking with a good map.  We highly recommend the many museums and half-day trip to Ostia.  We shall return.",5,2014,07,05
01,A good hotel at a great location,"I and my wife stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Bernini Bristol in Rome in early May 2014. This was our first trip to Rome and we wanted to stay in a comfortable hotel close to the major attractions. The Bernini Bristol, overall, did live up to our expectations.  
First the plus points of this hotel. It's location at Piazza Barberini is right at the heart of the city, within short walking distances to the Trevi Fountain, the Villa Borghese and the Spanish Steps and not too far from other major attractions. It has nice restaurants close by, a hop-on-hop-off tour bus stop as well as a subway station and a taxi stand within a few metres from the hotel entrance. In terms of location and transport options to and from the hotel, it is fantastic. The hotel lobby is a large, well decorated and welcoming space. Our room was tastefully decorated, had a comfortable queen sized bed and had all modern amenities. We had originally booked a Piazza Barberini View Deluxe Room but were upgraded to a Junior Suite. While the Suite did not have the beautiful fountain view of the Piazza, it was much more spacious & we decided to keep it (we had a look at the Deluxe Room also, which while smaller, was still relatively large compared to hotel rooms in Rome in general, and the city centre, in particular).The hotel has a splendid rooftop restaurant and bar with good food and excellent service. Additionally the hotel being much taller than the neighbouring buildings, the rooftop views are very nice. The morning breakfast spread is good with hot and cold dishes and is served in a big dining hall with ample tables. The hotel has a spa at the basement but we did not have the time to check it out since we were too busy outside enjoying the historical sights and sounds of Rome.     
Now the minus points. The hotel is a bit overpriced (probably due to its location), a tad less than the 5 star establishment claimed on its web site and the staff, while generally helpful and efficient, appear a bit impersonal at times. 
Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, it is a good hotel at a great location.",4,2014,06,18
01,Lovely hotel in a very good location with a ownderful rooftop bar,"My wife and Ii stayed here for a week.  it was my first visit to Rome and we ended up in a very nice hotel.
Friendly and attentive staff, lovely breakfast (expensive - we had ours as part of a B and B deal so it didn't feel too bad. 
bar in lobby is nice and bar on rooftop is really good, very pleasant place to sip prosecco and eat the plentiful supply of snacks offered. 
Hotel is only about 25 yards from one of the open top bus tour official stops (serving multiple tour companies).
Only one downside and that is the Wi-Fi, although free , is not very fast.",4,2014,06,10
01,Many Good Points,"This hotel has many plus points. These include:
1) It's location in terms of transport (close to metro and hop on and off buses) and its proximity to the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.
2) The service given by the Reception staff, the Concierge staff and the room maids was super, Karolina, a waitress in the rooftop restaurant and occasionally at breakfast was exceptional.
3) Despite being on the front facing the piazza, our room was quiet with windows closed. The only exception to this was on Wednesday when it appeared to be 'dustbin day'.
4) The spa - I had an amazing reflexology session; ask for Ileana,
5) The room was well appointed - linens, towels and toiletries were replenished frequently.
6) free wifi in room

There were some minor negatives; these are as follows:
1) speed and power of shower/bath water - you wouldn't want to be in a hurry!
2) cost of rooftop bar/restaurant - ridiculous! 
3) some minor decorative issues - eg a damaged door in the bathroom was poorly repaired.
4) wifi not available in some parts of the hotel,
5) hot water for tea at breakfast was tepid - I'm English and I like my tea piping hot and the hot dishes (eg scrambled eggs/bacon etc) at breakfast needed to be hotter.
6) too much chatter from male spa staff whilst treatments were ongoing. Sorry but this is a no-no for me when I am having a relaxing treatment.

Overall, this proved to be a good choice for our 5 day visit to Rome and I would have no hesitation in recommending it,",4,2014,06,06
01,Weekend in Rome,"The best thing about the hotel is its location. It is within walking distance to the Trevi Fountain , the Spanish Steps and a few other hot spots. The hop on hop off bus stop is right outside as well.
As you walk in the foyer it looks fantastic in marble but after that it goes down hill.
Our room was good..lovely big bed but our toilet leaked two of the three days we were there even though they ""fixed"" it! .lovely views from the roof top bar/restaurant but don't have food here as it was awful and waiter just as bad. It was so expensive we thought we'd have a lovely first evening there but very disappointed.
It is over rated no atmosphere nobody in the bar downstairs and they need to Hoover their hall carpets too.",3,2014,06,06
01,Classic & Comfortable,"Comfortable 4 night stay in a very classic old hotel.  Always greeted by the friendly lobby staff.  Large room by any standards with a view of the piazza (but still quiet in the room at night if I kept the windows closed).  Housekeeping at a good standard.  Bars were disappointing, both on the roof (very limited selection) and in the lobby (very limited service) so I ended up never trying a meal there.  Sad really as the view and ambiance on the roof is great.  Extremely convenient location right at the exit of the metro station.",4,2014,06,04
01,definately not 5 star,"spent 4 nights here from May 19th 2014 with my sister. Good points are great location, the hotel in general apart from our room was very nice especially the lobby and lounge area, thats where it ends though !!.
The bad points are as follows - the shower in our room was pathetic, more power from holding a watering can above your head, no tea or coffee making facilities, surely 5 star hotels should have these ? air conditioning in room was almost non existent, the breakfast was ok if you wanted a cintinental one as the hot food was stone cold every day.
Generally the staff were good apart from the first eve we went upto the rooftop area for a drink where we were asked what we would like (under duress !) and then the waiter promply vanished for 15 mins, eventually we asked another who took our order to finally get it another 15 mins later, not a great start !!.
Having paid so much for our stay we were expecting so much more for a 5 star hotel, hugely let down and wouldnt recommend. Also no pool.",3,2014,05,29
01,Totally over rated,We stayed here during a 3 week holiday to Italy.  The hotel is in a fabulous location but that's where it stops.  Staff were unhelpful to the point of being rude.  Having recently been refurbished I was wondering what they had spent their money on :(  Our room was noisy and we were moved after much consultation.  The only saving grace was the roof top restaurant.  Personally I would not stay here again.,2,2014,05,28
01,Rome Oasis,"My family and i fully enjoyed our dinner up on the rooftop bar.

The atmosphere is classic upper social strata Europa , so don't show up in a golf shirt and shorts for dinner!

Hosts Aly and Fabrizio will make you feel welcome, and the words "" Don't worry"" become real as they set a pace of service that is attentive,yet unassuming or rushed.  In the end you really do let go, and allow yourself to relax and enjoy the most inspiring view of old Rome and St Peters basilica, while dining with your new "" friends ""

I've come to Rome over fifteen times , and I often stay at the Bernini Bristol hotel. i highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,05,15
01,1st Class Hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights. Brilliant hotel. Staff so friendly, nothing any bother. Rooms large, airy, very stylish. They make you feel very special. Ally, the roof top bar staff member was brilliant. Arranged a birthday cake with no hassle & made our nite special. Hotel is in a great location, shops, restaurants, coffee shops, Sun & relation in the square. Loads of taxis and buses and not expensive. Only downfall was the cooked breakfast a bit oily for your liking, But that was a small thing as there was loads of fresh fruit & yogurts and cereal, toast etc. 
Would diffidently recommend this hotel & location.",5,2014,05,10
01,Great location with wonderful staff,"Lovely hotel well-situated right on the Piazza Barberini but away from the tourist centers so a little less hectic. Easy to walk or take excursion buses. Be sure to include the full breakfast in your reservation as it is excellent with a wide variety of food, both hot and cold.
Wi-fi is free in the lobby but quite expensive in the room.
The rooftop restaurant is expensive but the terrace has a great view and decent small plates.
The staff and concierges were extremely helpful for dinner reservations, directions, tours, and general information. Every staff member we met was pleasant, cheerful, and willing to be of assistance. Most spoke English.
The common areas of the hotel are very nice but our room could use a little updating - holes in the wall and tattered curtains. There is a very well-stocked but expensive honour bar. No air conditioning or fans. The bed was very comfortable and the linens and towels were good quality - towels were full-sized and not skimpy.
We would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,04,23
01,Roman Holiday,My aunt and I stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol a while back and we absolutely loved it.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I needed directions a few times and they were very happy to help.  The rooms were very nice and clean; we even had a terrace!  I would recommend this hotel to solo travelers as well as families.  The metro is right outside the hotel and other attractions are only a short distance away as well as some very nice restaurants; including the lovely rooftop restaurant in the hotel with amazing views.  When I return to Rome I plan on staying here again.  Wonderful and beautiful Hotel,5,2014,04,22
01,Do Not Stay There!,"Reading some of the reviews posted; It is a great location! Yet, please read on for our experiences.  
For some time I have debated with myself as to sharing our experiences at the Bernini Bristol Hotel. As  traveler, I was furious our agent was not more aware of the façade of this hotel. We left our bags with the concierge upon arriving at the hotel and  attended our first tour. Upon returning at 3:30 pm and checking into the hotel, we found our bedspread to be disgustingly dirty. The bathrooms were in desperate need of updating. Our toilet ran constantly. The vanity was cracked and chipped and the shower leaked, leaving large puddles on the floor despite our efforts to stop the flow. Our request for extra towels was never fulfilled. Our first evening there, we requested a bucket of ice. We called twice in the 48 minutes it took for them to bring one rock glass, half filled with melted ice. One entire day the elevators did not work at all, and we were like mice in a maze left trying to find our way out of the hotel. Truly, if that had been an emergency, we would have surely died. We passed several guest struggling to find their way out and employees of the hotel that could not find their way either.
 
The breakfast was nice with a lot of options, although the dishes were chipped, cracked and stained. The silverware was full of water marks and the glasses were scratched. 
 
The doormen that assisted with our bags; upon arriving and departing, seemed more inconvenienced and tossed our bags around, even though my husband gave them 50.00 euros on the front end of their task.
 
Finally, we had booked a reservation at the rooftop dinning room. To our dismay, they would not honor the welcoming letter that gave us a 5% discount that was addressed to us and left in our room. They insisted this would be good for a future stay and was not good for this visit. Needless to say, we will not be staying at that hotel again, nor will we return; even for a dinner. 
 
We did bring our concerns and experiences to the attention of the managers on duty. It seemed the more problems we found, the more we became a nuisance; instead of a paying guest. The only grievance that was corrected was the dirt bed spread. No compensation was offered nor given when we asked. It was obvious upon our departure, they were glad to see us go.

It is for these reasons we do not consider the Bernini Bristol Hotel a five star hotel. We intended to stay at the Waldorf Astoria. Our travel agent told us this hotel was just as nice and for only a little bit more money we would be in a much better location.",1,2014,04,16
01,Nice hotel but not 5 star.,"My partner and I stayed at the Bernini Bristol in Rome for 3 nights in April 2014. 
When you walk in the hotel looks lovely and overall is a lovely hotel. We stayed in a double room and we had actually stated on the additional comments that we wanted to confirm a double bed which they confirmed for us. However when we got our room we realised that it was 2 single beds pushed together. This wouldn't have been too much of a problem if they didn't keep separating as the beds slip on the floor and once my partner fell through the middle! As much as it was funny at the time overall it was pretty annoying.
The room was cleaned every day as in towels was changed, bed was made/changed and that really was about it. I've stayed at many hotels and usually when they clean the rooms they have a tidy etc (not that we were messy).. But they literally just changed the towels and bedding. I think when you stay somewhere that's 5 star you'd expect maybe more. 
They also don't supply an iron or ironing board (strange!) so we asked reception they said housekeeping would do it. So we had 2 items ironed and charged €20.
Breakfast was a good selection but they missed the most basic things like when they offer you tea and coffee they wouldn't bring milk or sugar over or a tea spoon, and even one of the days they even forgot the hot water. It was just silly things they would forget, but as I said a minute ago at this type of hotel you expect maybe more. 
The most helpful people we had were the reception staff they couldn't be more helpful and would always assist if needed and help with information. Lovely staff overall just maybe needs more attention when cleaning the rooms and at breakfast. I don't like moaning but was just unimpressed with those bits of the stay.  ",3,2014,04,15
01,Not for Tourists,"After stating in wonderful hotels in Florence and Venice we checked in here yesterday.  This is a hotel that clearly caters to the european business person, NOT the tourist. Setvice in rooftop bar was veerrry slow.  Service at breakfast is impersonal.  No internet in our room without paying extra.  No internet access at rooftop bar.  This is NOT a 5 star hotel.  We read the prvious reviews and trusted our travel advisor thus was a great hotel.  It has been disapponting, especially for the price we paid.  If you are visiting Rome on holiday I strongly suggest you stay elsewhere.",2,2014,04,09
01,Great location and hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend. Terific hotel with a superb roof top restaurant and bar that gives a panoramic view over the city. Particularly spectacular at night. Located very near the Trevi Fountain and Spanish steps with all other attractions within walking distance for those that like the exercise, if not, a metro station is outside the hotel with a bounty of taxis outside. Rooms are clean and spacious. No hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2014,04,08
01,Fantastic Location and Hotel,"This hotel is what Rome is all about. Fantastic location with awesome accommodations. Old room accommodations but very modern in the same breath. The staff made us feel very welcome and the hotel is very comfortable albeit a little pricey. 

Multiple restaurant locations around the hotel. Best cappuccino I've ever had directly across from the hotel.  I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Walkable distance to many of the sites within Rome. 

Make sure you sign up for their frequent stay program as we were able to even get an upgrade.",5,2014,04,07
01,Brilliant location!,"We chose this hotel for its location and it didn't disappoint! You are within walking distance of many of Rome's most famous sites (the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps are very close). There is also a metro station almost immediately outside the hotel, as well as a plentiful supply of taxis. 
  The hotel décor exceeded our expectations (traditional grand with a modern twist) and was very comfortable. The only complaint we had about our room was that one of the sliding doors to the wardrobe had been removed - but it didn't cause any problems.. 
  We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful without being over bearing. On arrival I found that the lock on my suitcase had jammed and they quickly sent someone up to our room to assist. The doorman was very friendly and immediately made you feel at home (he also gave us some handy directions!). Housekeeping were also very polite and always said hello when you passed them in the corridor.
 The breakfast was very good (this was included in our room price) with a perfect selection of hot and cold items to start the day (including lovely fresh Italian pastries!). We ate lunch at the roof top terrace once during our visit, which was wonderful. The food was good, but the main reason to pay the restaurant a visit is the view, which is spectacular! 
  There are lots of restaurants in the immediate locality and is definitely worth asking concierge for recommendations - we just followed our instincts on the first night and got our fingers burnt. The good restaurants around the hotel seemed to fill up fast, so would highly recommend
making reservations in advance to avoid disappointment. You also need to be prepared to pay a bit more than you would in some other parts of the city.
 All in all it was a fantastic base from which to explore the city and we would definitely return.",5,2014,04,03
01,Great stay,"Travelled to Rome to see the England Italy match in the six nations. Beautiful hotel a ten minute walk from the Trevi or Spanish steps. 15 minutes to the shopping centre. Gracious and supportive staff. We were upgraded to rooms (large with massive beds) with balconies. The roof top cocktail bar is brilliant with great views across Rome.
No complaints wound not hesitate to recommend.",5,2014,04,02
01,Lunch at roof-restaurant: excellent and unforgettable!,"I was looking for a restaurant with a panoramic view of the old town, and I found into the Bernini Bristol Hotel in Rome a fantastic location.
Starting from the welcome made by the Doorman, through the kindnesss of the Reception, and until the niceness of Waiters at the restaurant, the whole organization has been perfect.
Very good food in a breathtaking location.
Thanks for giving a wonderful lunch time to my family
Edoardo - Rome - Italy",5,2014,04,02
01,Lovely hotel in a great location!,"We stayed at this hotel during our family vacation to Rome.  We had two deluxe rooms which were spacious and clean. The hotel is in a great location in central Rome. However, it is in a very busy area so there was never a shortage of taxis outside the hotel even though we were able to walk to many tourist attractions. During our stay, we had a problem with the room safe and the room card key. The hotel manager could not have been more helpful in resolving these issues.  Overall, the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. Both the hotel manager and concierge had very good recommendations for lunches and dinners.  The breakfast had an incredible amount of options and was a wonderful way to start the day.",4,2014,04,01
01,Lovely grand hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a very good central location.
Our room was clean and tastefully decorated and I liked the touches of slippers being left out for you at night and a little chocolate on the side..
The view was good overlooking the fountain but it was a bit noisy so a higher room may be better if you are sensitive to noise!!
The roof top terrace was lovely with great views and did wonderful coffee with a tray of homemade biscuits.
Overall a good clean beautifully decorated hotel with a sense of grand Italy..
",4,2014,03,04
01,Great location and fabulous rooftop patio,"I've got to say, it's Rome - I knew going into it that the rooms would be smaller for the most part but they were totally adequate.  Very clean, and we had a great view (although no balcony unlike the lucky folks a floor below).  The location is walking distance to many attractions in Rome (I thought that the Coliseum was pushing it but I walked there too since it's just such an easy city to walk around in).  Much closer was the Trevi fountain and spanish steps as well as fantastic shopping.
One downside is that the elevators are scarce, tiny and dodgy...just a warning.
I stayed here during the Roman International Film Festival so there was a night when after wandering Rome all day I wanted to head up to the roof, have a drink and look over the city (the view is amazing) and it was closed for a film party.  But other than that, it was a great spot!",4,2014,03,01
01,Excellent location and good standing,"The hotel is both modern (entry and restaurants) and classic (the rooms and outside). The service is five star. We had dinner at the roof restaurant, excellent view and good standing. The lobby is also a five star standing.",4,2014,01,18
01,"Beautiful, Convenient, Great Service","Loved this hotel.  Spacious well equipped rooms and bathrooms,  comfortable lobby lounge with excellent service.  Helpful concierge.  We started our visit at a different hotel but when we saw the Bernini quickly decided to make the switch and so glad we did!",5,2014,01,16
01,Not too exciting,"Pros:
Excellent Location!
Close to Metro station
Friendly Staff

Cons:
Value for the price.
Our room which was facing the Via Barbarini Street was noisy.
Gym - Small; No AC during the winter time - sauna

We had high expectations when reserving this hotel. Stories about every room was designed differently. And about books about that take place in the hotel, and celebs staying in it.",3,2014,01,02
01,NOT WORTH IT,"Apparently a 5+ star hotel- but barely warrants 2-3 stars.  European hotels typically aren't spacious, but this one is.  That, and the location of the hotel are what you pay for.  Overpriced for an old hotel.  Upon arrival, we asked the concierge if there were any upgrades for travel agents and he lied to my face and said we were in the best room.....Later in our trip we got upgraded to the suite because of issues we encountered during this visit.  The bathrooms were tiny, an adult man would have to stand with his feet closed in the ""tub-shower"", and it was also extremely slippery.  In addition, the rooms were old, and EVERY SINGLE FLOOD smelt old, musty, and of cigarette smoke.  We complained about our first room because it smelt like mold, and the ground had visible blood, or feces on it.... They upgraded our room and it still smelt.  Breakfast was over 30 Euros, and it was just O.K.  They didn't have ketchup the whole time we were there, and they would barely replenish the water during breakfast.  Service was poor.  WiFi only in main lobby, otherwise you need to pay for it, and no irons in room.  I wouldn't recommend this place, but if you are looking for something walking distance to The Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps and close to other sights, this is a great location.  Also found an excellent restaurant down the road that made the experience more pleasant.",1,2013,12,10
01,Lovely Food,We only visited the restaurant of this opulent hotel as part of a cruise. Despite this we were treated well by the friendly and helpful staff who had very good English. From the rooftop restaurant we were served excellent Italian cuisine accompanied by local Tuscan wines. . Afterwards we went out onto the balcony to enjoy the fantastic views and take photographs.,5,2013,12,01
01,Excellent hotel in a magical city,"I spent a week in Rome staying at the Bernini Bristol -yes the one out of the Dan Brown book Angels and Demons. I stayed in 2005 but this time it was even more magical.  I absolutely loved it. I stayed in a superior room which was spacious, comfortable, well decorated with wooden floors and was very clean.   Even the Italian duvet covers were rich. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and it has a superb concierge team and bar staff and doormen. Nothing was too much trouble.  This hotel is excellent  and good value for money. There was a good choice of food at breakfast and the restaurant on the top of the hotel is a must. The hotel is superbly located  and the major sights are within a good walking distance - buy a map and have fun navigating and we took the 3 hours bus ride first. There are a number of excellent cafes and restaurants near the hotel all serving good food but the best one  was  the  restaurant Veneto 11 Srl in  the Via Vittorio Veneto but be careful because it only has a small entrance and we walked right passed it but went back.   We will be going back to Rome and this hotel next year.",5,2013,11,30
01,Excellent location,"Spend 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. 
A more business oriented hotel than turist hotel, consequently we were not stampeded by large tourist groups.
Excellent restaurant on roof with a wonderful view. 
Room appropriate in size and clean and well functioning.
The bearded doorman was very service minded and helpful - thank you.
Ideal location for walking to Spanisg Steps, Piazza Navona, Trevi fountain and Forum Roman and Via Veneto (La DolceVitae).
Metro station just outside hotel.
Arreviderci Roma (;-).",4,2013,11,26
01,"Lovely hotel, great location.","Clean, comfortable, pleasant hotel. Housekeeping was consistently good. Beds are comfortable. 
Concierge services were great. Lots of assistance offered in navigating Rome. Tickets booked for us without a hassle. Airport taxi was arranged for a member of our party who had to leave extremely early in the morning with absolutely no fuss. Staff is just very pleasant and helpful.
The only drawback to this hotel is the breakfast. It was not included in our stay and the cost of room service was foolish. Luckily there are many very nice cafes in the neighborhood, so it didn't really impact our stay. It would be nice if there was at least coffee/ tea in the rooms.
The location absolutely cannot be beat.
Can't recommend it enough.",4,2013,11,25
01,Good Hotel with Excellent Staff,"We stayed at the Bernini Bristol for 4 nights in November. Party of four adults and three children. Overall very happy with the hotel. The two bedroom suite was excellent and very comfortable. No tea/coffee facilities which I always find irksome. However, room service was always very prompt. The hotel has a very nice rooftop bar and restaurant which I would recommend for a drink but not the food. We ate there one night and found the reception unwelcoming and the service slow and impersonal. Their food is overrated and overpriced. Go for a drink and the view only. Apart from the restaurant the hotel staff are all welcoming and very professional. One word of warning, the wifi is paid for and expensive. We experienced constant problems trying to connect due to the security on our browsers blocking access to the internet. We gave up and relied instead on a mobile with a local 3G simcard (from mobile provider TIMS purchased at Fiumicino Airport for 20 Euros with I think 2gb of data) and used the mobile as a wifi hotspot.",4,2013,11,19
01,Wonderful stay!!!!!,"This hotel was wonderful. The staff was great from the front desk, concierge, to the person who helped with the bags up to the room, to the wait staff in the bars and restaurant! Breakfast had a lot of options to choose from. Loved the Pressco for breakfast. Also enjoyed the pots of coffee they brought to the table so you did not have to wait for another cup. The roof top restaurant had breathtaking views. Was warm enough to eat outside on the terrace. We had our anniversary dinner there and they made us feel very special. We also enjoyed the bottle of red wine that was in the room for us when we checked in. This place was great and well worth the price.",5,2013,11,16
01,Cloudy Stay- didnt see 1 let alone 5 stars egad!,"Needs an immediate makeover 
Still stick in 1956; in other words, the last time a hammer saw this place was before i was born.

On top of that (literally) being on the 7th floor under the 8th floor restaurant, I was awakened by some night owl table draggers at 2:30 in the morning! A half hour after i complained they resumed their chair and table dragging with a side of yelling.

Never again my dear girl at the reception desk. Never afain.",1,2013,11,10
01,Very poor customer service,The front desk is arrogant and unhelpful. No one is available to help you with you your suitcase as they are much too busy talking among themselves. They advertise Wi-Fi however it is only in the hotel lobby and rather difficult to manage. (They do offer room access for an additional charge.) The bathrooms are very nice. The level of service is not commensurate 5 star rating. ,2,2013,10,28
01,Doesn't deserve its star rating,"We expect more when we stay at a hotel with this star rating. The staff were obliging, concierge very helpful and knowledgeable and rooms well appointed. However in this day and age wifi should be available in the rooms. There is nothing worse than accessing wifi in the lobby while listening to others while they skype! 

We read reviews about breakfast with trepidation, sorry Bernini, they are all correct, you must lift your game. To queue for breakfast is bad enough but don't arrive after 8 o'clock because you will struggle to find a glass, a plate or the makings of a continental breakfast. Don't bother trying to order a coffee. Our experience is based on four consecutive breakfasts. ",3,2013,10,21
01,"Great hotel, excellent location","This hotel is centrally located to all main attractions - and is situated itself in a lovely area.

The room was much better than i had expected - beautifully decorated.

Breakfast adequate.

Would recommend 100%.",5,2013,10,20
01,Beautiful Italian quiet hotel.,"We stayed there on May 6-9, 2013 after a cruise. It is very quiet ( we like that) and has a rooftop restaurant. We had a private elevator to the restaurant. The view was lovely, we could see the Vatican and a lot of Rome .I can't say enough about the mattress and sheets. They were so comfortable and luxurious. Windows that opened up so we could get fresh air. Furnishings were lovely.  Service was impeccable. The breakfast buffet was a feast. The restaurant itself was very good. My only two negatives were the rounded-bottom bathtub.We had a hard time with that being slippery. The other was no covers on the room service food. It lost a lot of heat. All in all, we loved our stay. Pricey but a treat. 
We finished off our vacation with a luxurious ride to the airport. The driver, John Lucca made the short trip memorable. Showing us my favorite sight of the Trevi Fountain and no people present. He took pictures for us as I had some back problems.  Rome at night is beautiful and we had a very early flight to catch. John Lucca made sure we were at the right place as we speak no Italian. Ask for John Lucca for your ride to the airport.",4,2013,10,19
01,Very nice stay,"We arrived early but after traveling all night they were happy to get us into the first available room.  We had asked for a ""contemporary"" room but took the ""traditional"" room since it was available and we needed to crash. The bed was not very comfortable, but we probably could have slept on rocks.  The room was otherwise nice. The breakfast was good.

The location was great - close to walk to lots of things like the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain.  We often took a cab out to the farthest location for the day, and walked our way back.

The staff went out of their way to help us contact some Italian relatives we wanted to meet up with.  Also, they gave us change so we weren't carrying so many large bills around.  Very helpful!

Free wifi in the lobby was a plus.  Good enough to FaceTime with the family back at home!",4,2013,10,16
01,A Wonderful Oasis from the Bustle of Rome,"I cannot say enough good things about this centrally located hotel in the heart of Rome.  The staff is extraordinary, especially the concierge department - Danta, Max, Domenico and Niccola.  They were helpful in making restaurant recommendations, offering tips for us, first time to Rome travelors.  The rooms were great.  We had two overlooking the Barberini Palace next door.  The hotel is located next to the Barberini Metro stop whih got us to the Vatacan and as far away at Tivoli and the Villa d'Este.  We were a 15 minute walk from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.  We were also 15 minutes from the Via Veneto.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the rooftop restaurant.  We preferred eating outside in the many piazzas that don't allow cars.  The doormen would always greet you and ask you about your travels and adventures around Rome.

We stayed seven nights and got to know Rome well.  Although it is expensive it is worth every penny.  It's a smaller, more intimate hotel, and has all the advantages over a bigger less personal place.

I recommend the Bernini Bristol without reservation - but make reservations, it is always full!",5,2013,10,16
01,They are not the only 5 star hotel in town,"The pluses: I arrived around 11am and the front desk staff found me a room I could use immediately - even though check in is supposed to be 3pm. My room was spacious but a strange shape and the ""desk"" was an ornate piece of furniture quite useless for working, bed comfortable.
The minuses: Breakfast was very poor. Typical continental plus some eggs. but very expensive. Also as noted in another review early morning service does not exist. Internet was complicated to access in my room - buy a one hour voucher, then buy another 10 hour voucher. To be fair it worked and you only pay for the time you are actually online. So that was better than those hotels where the time is elapsed time not used time. TV advertised CNN and BBC but only had CNN.
The lobby and rooftop restaurant were very ornate but the paneling is now dated. The staff were certainly Roman - I was doing them a favour by visiting........
During my stay the hotel was full - and I think with a good split between business people and holiday makers judging from the dress styles in the breakfast room.

I stayed here because my regular hotel in Piazza della Reppublica was full. I will go back to my regular hotel next time.",3,2013,09,27
01,A disapointing experience,"When I see some of the 4 and 5 star reviews here, I wonder if I stayed at the same hotel.  I was at the Hotel Bernini Bristol for 4 nights (Sep 14 -18, 2013). This review is based on a standard room ($445 USD per night), others may be different.

The positives:
Located a few meters from the metro station and the open top city tour bus stop.  Also the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps are within walking distance.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The room is quiet (nice sound insulated double glass windows).  Hotel has three good size elevators (a luxury in Europe).

The negatives:
Starting with the unfriendly (can I say rude?) reception desk staff (they forget that it is the guests that pay their salary).  The room is a good size but somewhat tacky decoration.  Taking a shower is a challenge since the water temperature swings from scalding hot to freezing every 30 seconds.  After the second night we ran out of tissue paper and the house keeping staff never replaced it.  After the third night we ran out of the primary toilet paper roll (we used the backup roll, but this was also not replaced by housekeeping.   We used the wine glasses in the room and they were never replaced with clean ones.
Breakfast is 36 Euros (expensive).  The food was average at best.  The service leaves a great deal to be desired.  The restaurant does not open until 7:00 AM (no room service prior to 7:00 AM either).  I mention this because if you have any early tours you will not be able to get breakfast.  If your travel plans have early tours, do not take the breakfast included room rate.
This may sound petty, but how can a hotel that bills itself as a 5 star not have a doorman opening the doors for guests all the time?  In all my entries and exits, only twice was the door opened for me.  They should just install automatic doors then.

Bottom line:
I would never stay there again, would not recommended it and will share this experience with the travel agent that put us there.",2,2013,09,21
01,"Beautiful hotel, full of character","The hotel was luxurious and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful, their English was outstanding as my Italian is poor!
We only ate breakfast once which I felt was overpriced and no better than a motorway service area in England although the restaurant did have linen tablecloths! ",4,2013,09,19
01,Average staff and over priced,"The staff was less than helpful and willing when I stayed there. Mind you, I spent well over $500 per night for the 2 nights I was there and did not receive the things I was suppose to- Champagne and fresh fruits. The breakfast was barely edible and just mostly...the staff was blah. Location OK but there was construction around the fountain.",3,2013,09,17
01,Average hotel good location,"I just came back from a visit to the good old Bernini, the hotel is old and dated however its still charming to experience. Hotel staff are not the best in the hospitality game which I think it's due to them not having to work hard for filling the hotel especially with its central location (they do come off as rude sometimes). All in all I would say stay here for a short trip to rome as its as central as you can get, I'm not sure if I would give them a five star rating in neither service or facilities. But a good base for first time visiting rome. ",3,2013,09,04
01,Lovely hotel,"I should first say I was exteramly impressed with the hotel. While I was there I had a problem with out tv, after informing the front dest they sent a someone up to me room immediately to sort the problem. They were friendly and very helpful. 
Later on out first day there we came back to our room to find it flooded, we called the reception and they had someone up to our room to fix the problem within minutes, unfortunately the air conditioner had blown up and could not be fixed, the concierge had us moved rooms. The room we were place in was a much better room with a larger bathroom and entrance hall. The staff were incredibly apologetic about everything. 
Overall I was very pleased with the hotel, the staff were kind and welcoming, the rooms were beautiful and immaculate and even though there were issues they were handled quickly and efficiently. 
I would recommend the Bernini Bristol to anyone looking for a central hotel in Rome and I would definatly stay there myself on my next visit.",5,2013,09,01
01,Beautiful Hotel,"Our family had two adjoining rooms that were beautiful, spotless and had spectacular views of the plaza.  The fountain was being repaired, but the view was still spectacular.  We had cocktails on the roof after a long day of site-seeing and were stunned at how beautiful the view was of the entire city.  Fabrizio arranged a table for 8pm dinner, and our teenage daughter's thought
the evening was simply dream like.  The service was friendly and accommodating, and the food was typical of what one expects when eating in Rome - perfect.  Dining on the roof is a elegant affair and everyone was dressed accordingly.  

The location is excellent and the staff was very helpful and professional.",5,2013,08,18
01,You'll Bristle @ The Bristol,"Sadly this recently renovated hotel still needs reconstruction. The location is ok but the setting is not. The lobby and rooms were decorated in vintage ""tacky"" and the water systems were not updated. We had three rooms and all were less than impressive. Two of our rooms were suites which did provide a lot of space but it did not make up for the deficiencies of service and style.

Service is in need of a major upgrade. They just don't understand how to please though I think a few of them really want to offer a high level of service. Staffing is lean too. It takes a long time for room service. We had several issues which required us to go down to the front desk because they didn't answer when you called. The concierge has no idea what he is doing or is just a bad communicator. Simple requests stumped him and he was often ""on break"" with no back-up. We just stopped asking.

Other ""Amenities"": The health club is very dated and totally insufficient. The basement spa is a molded hot tub staffed/dressed by someone who looked like he was just off the street. The included breakfast is really awful with bad juice, stale pastries and canned fruit. Even the eggs were cold. This was a big surprise because they have a top-rated roof-top restaurant . Go figure?

Lastly, we even had security issues as a neighboring room tenant opened the connecting door to one of our suites and walked in half naked and rather inebriated. Hotel staff seemed baffled by the whole thing and remarked that they were sorry but not sure what they could do. I fianlly lead them to the room to make sure that door was locked and secure.

There are so many options in Rome that you should consider first. Hopefull The Bristol can improve and once again be a better than average hotel.",2,2013,08,16
01,For business or for leisure is the best,"I was with a party of 30+ and we've had our business conference there in July. 
We've ate at the restaurant on the rooftop, the food is out of this planet!
The waiters and waitress were kind and helpful, the drinks kept coming and the food portions were big enough even for a ""buona for beta"" like me !
It might be a bit pricey but hey: I didn't pay a penny :)",5,2013,07,30
01,Closest to the Spanish steps....,We stayed in adjoining rooms with our family of four.  The rooms were relatively large by European standards.  Was disappointed to find out that the pool shown in there advertising is only for the suites so my kids were disappointed.  Also disappointed that given the cost of the rooms that they charged for wifi in the rooms.  The free wifi in the lobby requires a new code every 24 hours which was inconvenient to say the least.  Overall an ok experience but not 5 star.,3,2013,07,19
01,An excellent home base for your first trip to Rome,"Rooms are relatively large and bathrooms updated, although the trendy open shower made for a wet floor every time! The mattresses were quite comfortable (surprising for Europe!) and climate control was accurate.
Good location for walking to the ""can't miss"" attractions in Rome. 
The buffet breakfast was extensive and excellent. The rooftop patio was an incredible spot for cocktails but the lunch and dinner we ate there were unremarkable.
There was a laundromat and a pharmacy close by and many options for dining. It is on the Metro Line B and there was a taxi stand at the bell desk. Concierge was excellent - thank you Nicola for all your help!",4,2013,07,15
01,Perfect location OK hotel,"Bernini Bristol is an old-fashioned, old style and a little bit OLD hotel. The rooms are large and needs a touch, the breakfast is ok for an European hotel and the roof top has an  extraordinary view. Concierge is nice and very experienced and the stuff are lovely. But the reason you may choose to stay here is the area. Piazza Barberini is the best location to stay in Rome, you can walk nearly every famous and historical place in the city which makes life easier. If you are looking for something fancy this is not what you are looking for BUT if you are in search for a decent place to sleep you can choose Bernini.",3,2013,07,08
01,Space,"Excellent location, walking distance to great spots and plenty of closet space.  A dad and two sons in a room (two twins plus a rollaway twin) had plenty of room and plenty of closet and drawer space for clothes.  The rooftop restaurant and lounge was a big hit.  We went there every night before heading out on the town.",5,2013,07,07
01,Quality Hotel,"We returned to the hotel because we had spent our honeymoon here 10 years ago. The room we had was large and comfortable.
The Breakfast was generally set up to be an excellent buffet but we had a variety of issues, usually there was nothing in the tray with potatoes, on one morning almost everything had run out at 8:30am and there were no forks to be had at all in the Breakfast room. The staff at breakfast appeared to be uninterested in the people trying to get breakfast and had to be chased for Coffee.
The Bar also shut at 6pm and drinks were served in the bar on the roof which appeared to be the waiting area for the roof restaurant and not the comfortable area to finish an evening.
These did not detract from a wonderful holiday in Rome but I would be unlikely to return to The Hotel Bernini Bristol.",3,2013,07,02
01,"Top location, excellent rooms","My wife and I spent 8 nights here the last week of June, 2013. Our room, a deluxe facing the Piazza, was well appointed, with a special appreciation from both of us for the spacious bathroom and the jazuzzi. This is extremely uncommon in Rome. The breakfast was bountiful, and if you have an opportunity for a rooftop dinner as we did, and the evening has a clear sky and cool air, this adds greatly to the experience.

Complaints: the A/C struggled and failed during the afternoons with the sun blazing, even with the curtains fully closed. To be fair, by bedtime, the room temperature was pleasant. But forget about a nap in the afternoon.

The fitness facility, which we did not use, was poor, which in fairness is typical at any hotels in Rome. For the business traveler who depends on these, I could not recommend this hotel.

The price of the hotel in the end was more than we had been told, but for the high season, it was reasonable for a hotel of this stature. 

There appeared to be mostly families and tour groups staying at the hotel, and they all seemed to enjoy the location, the breakfast and the rooms. 

For a week long stay, I don't think you can do much better in Rome for the price. For a shorter stay, I believe you can. Check other Trip Advisor listings, including the Hotel delle Nazione, which I stayed at for three nights in May 2013.",4,2013,06,30
01,A Nice Hotel – Excellent Location,"I stayed at the Bernini Bristol for three nights in mid-June.  This is a nice hotel with an excellent location. The subway is literally right outside the door and accessible both to the left and right. (I found this to be invaluable. The subway is easy to use, cheap, and quick; I used it to get all over the city.) In addition, the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, and Piazza Navona are all close by the hotel and easily walkable.  There is also an excellent view from the upper floors. 

The front desk staff was friendly. However, I did think that the concierge staff could be more helpful.  They answered questions, but typically in the most cursory fashion possible.  This could use some improvement.   

My complaints are focused in two areas.  First, the wifi in this hotel only free in the lobby and the overall system they use is cumbersome.  When I can get free wifi at sidewalk cafes and at lesser hotels, why do I need to buy access by the minute at a hotel like this?  Second, the breakfast staff at the Bernini Bristol is horrible. The hostess is unfriendly and verges on rude.  Beyond that, you can’t get coffee; you may or may not have silverware; and there are frequently no clean glasses for the juice on the buffet.  On my last morning, I was amused that several bottles of champaign were out, but none were open and there was absolutely no hope of getting the staff to attend to it. Notably, I was early to breakfast each morning.  I suspect all of this gets much worse as they get busy, so I’d advise that you go early.
 
In general, I liked the hotel, but I think there are some basic things that management could easily improve.",3,2013,06,29
01,"Great location, nice rooms, spotty service","We stayed at the Bernini Bristol for 4 nights in early May.  The biggest plus is the location.  The subway is right outside the door.  You are the foot of the Via Veneto and a short walk from the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps.  The Pantheon and Piazza Navona are also within reasonable walking distance.  As for hotel itself, the rooms are quite nice and the breakfast good, not great.  The rooftop restaurant looked lovely, but we did not eat there.  Way too expensive.  Ditto for the lobby bar.  The Wi-Fi in the lobby was very spotty and the concierge was of little help.  One was extremely rude and did not want to be bothered.  However, housekeeping was excellent and the doormen were efficient and friendly.  Overall, a good experience.",4,2013,06,26
01,Bernini You Were Awesome,My family of five had the absolute pleasure to stay at the Bernini. This hotel is centrally located and close by great sites and venues. The staff was so kind and courteous especially the door man who hailed a taxi for us each day. Outstanding service and attention to detail. We had two adjoining rooms and the staff allowed us to check in at 8:30 in the morning so we could rest. We truly appreciated it. Our rooms included the breakfast which was well done and quite refreshing. Rooms were impeccably maintained our entire stay. Don't believe the other bad reviews. People tend to treat you the way you treat them. Bernini you were awesome!!!! Hope to stay with you again.,5,2013,06,17
01,Wonderful hotel in Rome,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. It is a wonderful and classy hotel with friendly personnel. 
The room was elegant and the breakfast delicious and plentiful. The hotel is in a very central location. One of the finest hotels we've ever stayed at. Highly recommended!",5,2013,06,17
01,Worst hotel in Rome!,"Not to put it in a nutshell being from Dubai and having visited several countries and putting up in the worst and finest hotels this one really takes the cake!

Lets begin with the cons:
upon arrival no sign of doormen probably busy sleeping in the afternoon given he was really old. Checking in went smoothly untill we got to our room and realise they downgraded us and upon confronting them only did they change our room to the super deluxe which we had booked into. The super deluxe room had a really bad odour and we asked to be shifted immediately but only to find that the other room we shifted into had a peculiar smell also. The carpet in the room was badly stained, the chair was ready to collapse, no english channels on TV, no pool in the hotel although they advertise it on their website and other advertising media, bathroom tub was long in length but 20 cm in width which means you have to close your feet together while standing in there, plumbing problems on a daily basis, 36 euros for terrible breakfast, no good advice for restaurants from concierge except try the ones beside the hotel!

Now if you are still hoping to see the Pros, i wish you luck staying in this hotel. BTW i have never given such bad reviews for any hotel i have ever stayed in before so for me to sit and give this review is only so that people dont waste their money on this so called '5 star'

To sum it up, if this was the last hotel in Rome ever... id say ciao Roma!",1,2013,06,16
01,Great experience!,"We had a great experience here!  All the front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge Masimilliano who helped us with phone calls, meeting our tour guides, etc.  We could see St. Peter's dome from our room, and the room was very comfortable.  The hotel has a fantastic location, right at a Metro stop, with a famous Bernini fountain in front (sadly covered up because of renovations) and walking distance to the Cappuccin Crypt, the Spanish Steps, and the Via Veneto!  The entry hall is very opulent.  The only quibble I would have is that they show a rooftop pool in their boilerplate photos but it isn't accessible to all guests--it's only accessible from the Presidential Suite.",5,2013,06,13
01,Impressive attentiveness,"Our first trip to Rome started out horribly as the airline lost our luggage. For 3 days, all we had was my carry-on. They had made my wife check hers, and lost it as well. Contained in that was her medications. To say that we leaned on the hotel staff in general and the hotel's concierges in particular is an enormous understatement. Always friendly, always sympathetic, always professional. They not only helped us with all of the usual needs one has as a stranger in a strange land, but over and above when helping us with our particular issues. Paramount among them was getting a doctor to come to our room - on a scooter - IN THE RAIN - and write several prescriptions when our pharmacist was unable to order replacement medications. We will forever be grateful to Head Concierge Massimiliano Errichiello and his wonderful staff for saving the Trip-of-our-Lifetime.

Regarding the less-important issues, our room was very pleasant and clean, and so was the bathroom. The staff kept it that way. The breakfasts were wonderful, but as we wanted to do the ""sidewalk dining experience"", we never did use the hotel for dinner, so our review cannot comment on it. The location was perfect for a first-time Rome visitor. Many of the highlights were within easy walking distance for my 60-year-old legs.

Upon checking out, I made a promise to the concierge that we will stay no where else on our next Roman holiday. It will be an easy promise to keep.",5,2013,06,11
01,Staff inattentive and service terrible.,We just left there with our tour group (Disney). The staff was rude and stoic. Not warm at all. The food was not good. I understand serving a large group can be challenging but aren't Italians used to that?  We did eat on the roof top restaurant and once again food ordinary and they barely filled the silly little 4 oz wine glasses. Once I complained to the gentleman (host) was extremely apologetic and the waitress immediately came over and filled those silly little glasses to the brim! The host was by far the nicest person in the hotel along with the cleaning staff. So glad to have left there. I did inform the Disney guides. Arrivederci!,2,2013,06,10
01,A baroque/roman-tic holiday,"Our last Roman holiday was a family affair (consisting of three generations!) and detailed logistics and organised tours were the order of the day.  This time around it was just my spouse and myself so we decided on a more laid-back and romantic approach, and what better place to spend a week's holiday than in the delicious Bernini Bristol!  Its location (right smack in Baroque Rome, but far away enough from the Trevi Fountain/Spanish steps so that one does not have to 'swim' through the throngs) is ideal, its personnel, esp. the concierges, are wonderfully helpful (one recommended a nearby pizza place only frequented by the locals and that became to us our most memorable eating place during our stay, so we ate there again before we left) and its rooftop restaurant has a most wonderful nighttime view of the City and St. Peter's!  
Our room had a great view of the plaza, and although the fountain was covered for needed renovations, we enjoyed watching the Romans going about esp. in the early morning hours. 
We were however quite disappointed with the Bellinis at the Lobby Bar, so should one have a hankering for this most 'iconic' drink, one should traipse over to Harry's Bar - not too far a walk from the hotel, which is again a virtue of its location!",4,2013,06,03
01,"Great area, wonderful view, nice staff -- but extremely dated rooms!","I stayed at the Bernini Bristol earlier this month for 4 nights. We had a beautiful view of Rome from our room, but unfortunately the lovely fountain in Piazza Barberini was covered as it is undergoing renovations! Nevertheless, the view was still gorgeous.

PROS:
-Very friendly staff who provide excellent dining suggestions!
-The area is perfect -- there are many great restaurants close by, and it's right on a subway line
-Hotel looks great from the outside, and the lobby is lovely!

CONS:
-The room was not the greatest. The shower in the bathroom could not be used without getting water all over the place, fixtures were very dated. 
-Cleanliness was below my expectations for a 5-star hotel! The bathtub was a bit grimy (stick to showers if you come here!)
-WiFi was only available in the lobby and not in the room, unless you wanted to pay for it (if you don't need to use it, then this isn't an issue!)
-The room service food was not good -- I ordered a small breakfast one day, and was very disappointed with the quality of the food and the presentation. I didn't go to the rooftop restaurant, so hopefully it is better!

This trip was the third and final stop of a 3-city European tour that included Paris and Amsterdam. By far, it was my least favourite hotel experience. I hear that Rome's hotels are mostly dated like this, but I do recommend researching some other hotels in Rome first!",3,2013,05,29
01,"Terrible! Old, expensive, but a great location.","Terrible! Old, expensive, but a great location. 
Besides being in one amazing spot of Rome, the hotel is terrible in general - especially considering the price they charge for it. They even charge you 25 euros for Internet access in the room. I must say, the worse cost/benefit experience I have ever had in Italy.",2,2013,05,29
01,Satisfying!,"Great location, very clean room but without any view although in 7th floor.
Quite noisy as roof garden was right above and the staff was kind of rude. Breakfast was nice but for this amount of money it could be better.",3,2013,05,28
01,Perfect location!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel at the end of our Italian honeymoon. It was the hotel I was most looking forward to as it is a 5 star hotel in a perfect location. The hotel overall was amazing. The food was exceptional, the view was of the piazza barberini and was within easy walking distance to the Trevi fountain, spanish stairs and Jimmy Choo!! The breakfasts were huge (biggest out of our italian trip). The staff were wonderful, particularly a lively and very friendly waiter in the upstairs restaurant. He literally made every evening an absolute party. The bathroom amenities were lovely. I was however slightly disappointed with the decor of the bedroom. While it was luxurious and lovely, I felt that it needed a little upgrade. Coming from the new Brunellschi hotel in Florence I just thought the Bernini was slightly outdated. That aside it was a very comfortable, luxurious room. The food both dinners and breakfasts were amazing and the hotel was close to all major attractions. I would very much recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,23
01,Delightful hotel in heart of Rome,"We stayed only one night prior to our cruise departure, but were delighted with the quality and value of the hotel, which is situated in the heart of Rome, within walking distance of  the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and US Embassy. The rooms are large, clean and sunny.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and excellent.  I particularly commend the General Manager who was both kind and helpful.",4,2013,05,21
01,5 Star Stay,"We have just returned from 4 nights in Rome staying at the Bernini Bristol courtesy of Citalia. The package included free room upgrade, welcome drink, buffet breakfast, 15% off the L'Olimpo Restaurant and a free museum visit, for a not unreasonable sum. Sounds too good to be true? No it wasn't.

The service was excellent, the staff all being very friendly. The rooms were clean and of a very high standard. Breakfast was fresh, hot and included Bucks Fizz if you wanted it. As for the free museum visit we got our Vatican Museum tickets paid for (refunded by the Consierge).

We also had a meal in the L'Olimpo Restaurant choosing the Chateau Briand at 80 euros plus a 30 euro bottle of wine. Whilst it may seem expensive, with the 15% discount it wasn't much more than a good restaurant would charge in the UK. However the quality was impeccable, and what are holidays for but to spoil yourselves!

We alo had a couple of drinks in the downstairs bar - 12 euros  fro a beer and a tea. This included crisps, nuts etc and wasn't really any more expensive than the average restaurant / bar in the streets, especaillty considering the snacks. 

Location is very good - 10 minute walk to both Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. Bernini Metro stop is within 30 meters of the hotel entrance and is on the same line as the one needed for the Vatican. Therefore access to and from the airport wasn't a probalem at all - train and metro saving a fair bit of money for the pair of us over a taxi - only lots of escalators to negotiate.

I would recommend the Hotel Bernini Bristol, particularly for couples.",5,2013,05,11
01,What a mistake!,We traveled throughout Italy and stayed in the most fabulous hotels and then arrived at the Bernini.  What a mistake.  No help with our bags to start with.  The folks at the reception desk were rude.  There was construction in the Lobby.  And it was terribly HOT!  We arrived in our small dark HOT outdated room and almost cried.  We made several requests with the concierge and I think he went out of his way to be a jerk.  We made a pact to see as many sites as possible and stay in the room as little as possible.  And thats what we did.,1,2013,05,08
01,Very tired and not real customer friendly,"Every place you look you see need for maintenance.  There is mold in bathrooms.  Furniture in need of repair. Paint that is chipped.  It just doesn't feel like a four star hotel. 

I had a problem with my AMEX Platinum card and the front desk barely tried to assist. Problem was not resolved by them.

Our room was supposedly not smoking...but the mattress wreaked of smoke.

The internet was very expensive...7 eu for 3 hours.

The shower in the bath flooded everytime we used it.

There are better hotels in Rome.",1,2013,04,26
01,Frustrating Internet!,Nice hotel (we are staying now) but the hotel's system for Internet connection is expensive and frustrating. This is our fifth hotel of a three week lovely trip and all the other hotels we have stayed at have had seamless Internet and most of them offer it free of charge. Here it is free in the lobby but cumbersome and in you room you have to pay by the hour (several euros per hour) for each device you have. We are not Internet obsessed but do use it to plan our day and restaurant choices. For this reason alone I would go somewhere else next time. It should be so easy. ,3,2013,04,21
01,Fabulous restaurant,Myself and my husband recently visited this hotel for a friends wedding. Their reception was on the Roof garden and WOW!!! what a gorgeous hotel and what amazing views over the city. The food is absoloutly amazing! the whole setting of the hotel is pure luxury and the staff are so attentive......A*+. Even if you aren't able to stay in the hotel it is worth visiting for a coffee or even dinner. Beautiful hotel and prime location!!!,5,2013,04,17
01,excellent location,"Right in the centre of Rome 5 minutes from the Spanish steps etc. Excellent rooms, roof top restaurant with the view of the city a bonus, you can see the most of the city including the Vatican from the roof, wonderful when lit up at night. Very traditional hotel, well worth a visit for pleasure next time",4,2013,04,14
01,Great Hotel!,"Just got back from trip to Italy with my family, including 3 kids, and can't say enough good things about this hotel! Our travel agent picked the hotel, and it was perfect....clean, courteous staff, nice rooms, perfect location, helpful concierge, great food/cappucino in their restaurant, and beautiful spa.  You will not be disappointed if you stay there. We blew a fuse with one of the plug adapters I brought, and their maintenace worker was at our room within minutes, and later returned with 3 good adapters that he gave us.   All staff we dealt with spoke adequate English. Free breakfast buffet was also excellent.",5,2013,04,08
01,"AMAZING room, below average customer service","I booked this hotel on recommendation of several friends. The hotel is gorgeous. Surprise, our room was upgraded to a mini suite. The amenities were wonderful, and the view was lovely. The service however...

The customer service at the concierge and front desk needs serious work. I waited in line for 15 minutes to check-in. Not because it was busy, but because several people cut in front of me. The host just looked at me and recognized that I'd been waiting but ignored me, and helped them anyway.

I went to the concierge to get some change for a taxi and to tip the bellhop and he just scoffed and said he couldn't give me change (I had 20 Euros). He couldn't break a 20? Really? The concierge? I even told him it was because I needed change to tip one of his coworkers. He still wouldn't give me the change I wanted. Then someone else walked in the door and he left me mid sentence to greet whomever had just walked in. I felt like it was a terrible inconvenience that I was asking him a simple question. 

Again, the hotel is beautiful but I judge a hotel on service, and it wasn't there.",3,2013,04,04
01,Central location,"This hotel is centrally located, making most of the attractions within easy walking distance. The metro  is located almost next door if you prefer to let the train take the strain.

The staff were all extremely polite and helpful, but  I did feel that the hotel was a little dated and lacking in facilities.  That combined with the exorbitant prices, means we will not be returning here",3,2013,03,16
01,Excellent hotel and location. Hotel service standards need to improve!,Was on a 5 day break with my husband. Firstly given the wrong room then eventually got to the right one but was a challenge as the porter could not speak or understand a single word of English. Was exactly as we expected it. Breakfast was good but the staff were not as friendly as expected. On one of the days our room was left open by housekeeping. Not at all impressed with this service. Overall the location was brilliant. All places in walking distance but accessible by tube which is right outside the hotel. Would recommend the hotel but have to raise service standards to meet 5 star rating. ,4,2013,02,25
01,Average business hotel,"Stayed for a business meeting in this good location hotel, near Rome center. Business amenities are good, rooms just an average. Far not a 4 star hotel level. Breakfast was really good, staff friendly. Internet expensive.",3,2013,02,03
01,Da Vinci Code,"Stay in this hotel featured in Dan Browns book. Well located and very comfortable. Good restaurant within easy walking distance. Easy access into the centre of Rome. Staff very helpful and pleasant, rooms comfortable and spacious.",4,2013,01,31
01,Lovely hotel in great location,We stayed for a long weekend and had booked a suite.  The hotel staff spoke good English and the room was beautifully appointed.  The breakfast were fine for a hotel of its class but the real treat is the rooftop restaurant.  whether you just fancy a cocktail or a full meal this is a wonderful spot with exquisite food.  I would certainly recommend this hotel to any looking for somewhere special to stay in Rome.,4,2013,01,31
01,Nice hotel.  Excellent Service.  Great Location.,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights in late December 2012 as part of our Adventures by Disney tour of Italy.  The rooms were quite nice and relatively large for ""big city"" hotel-rooms.  We had a king bed (a rare thing in Europe, as most hotels have two twins pushed together) with an adjoining room for the kids.  The beds were very comfortable, the linens were nice, and the bathrooms were lovely.  The location of this hotel is excellent, as it is a short walk to the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps, and walkable to many other interesting sites in Rome.  The concierge was excellent, as he worked tirelessly to contact the airport and airline to locate the luggage lost by our airline. 

The negatives of thsi hotel were that we had a hard time controlling the temperature of our room.  We often got hot, requiring us to open the windows which brought in more street noise.  (There already was some street noise with the windows closed, but that is to be expected in a large city.)  Also, I'm always put-off by having to pay for wifi at nice hotels, and this hotel does not offer free wifi (and it was not included in our tour package).  

We did eat breakfast at the hotel, which was included with our package.  The buffet was standard fare (although I could have done without the watery scrambled eggs).  The service was very good, however.  

All in all, this is a good hotel for our fun stay in Rome.",4,2013,01,04
01,Delightful stay,"I booked this hotel for a 4 night stay on the strength of the good reviews here. Arriving too early for check-in, the friendly reception staff took care of my luggage and gave me a discount voucher for lunch at their rooftop restaurant. It was a lovely november day and I was the first customer at the restaurant which commands great views of the city's roof-scape. My waiter was charming and attentive and I had a delicious lunch. I would have gone back if not for the many restaurants and cafes nearby the central location of this delightful hotel. 
My room was spacious, clean and the large double bed was comfortable. Windows open out to a side street and being on the 6th floor traffic noise was minimal. I had a similar hot-but-suddenly-cold-then-hot shower as described by some reviewers but only on one morning.
Almost everywhere was accessible with the Metro only a minute away. I was able to walk to most places of interest from the hotel. The friendly doorman Stefano gave me a useful tip for going to St Peter's Square and the Vatican on the electric-powered bus from opposite the hotel which offered a more interesting and scenic route than the metro and cheaper than a taxi. The reception staff gave me names of nearby restaurants with directions where I could find a good meal. Breakfast was plentiful and varied and I liked looking out on to the Piazza Barberini and the morning traffic which was never too busy. Despite the crowded breakfast room each morning, I was satisfied with the service. A real find, will definitely return.",5,2012,12,07
01,Loved it,"We took a 5 night break through Citalia and chose the Bernini.  Reception staff were great,  Citalia had not given us our accommodation voucher but the hotel staff sorted it.  Our room was comfortable and spotless.  There was a good selection at breakfast.  It is a lovely building which has retained a lot of its old charm.  Would we stay the again?  Definitely.  It is quite well located.  Not far from the Spanish steps and Trevi fountain, and the Vatican and colosseum are equidistant.  Both the Vatican and colosseum are walkable if you are fit.",4,2012,11,24
01,Not a Five Star Experience,Short overnighter in a hotel that fell slightly short of the usual 5 star standard. My bedroom overlooked the square and fountain. But unfortunately it was too hot (even with all systems off) and opening the window admitted too much traffic noise to sleep. Obligatory cold shower in the morning because could not get any hot or even warm water. And the breakfast just wasn't up to standard. Orange juice was not fresh. Bread was not fresh. Bacon was burned. No complaints about the staff. Internet worked well. Just the hotel generally did not live up to the 5 star standard.,3,2012,11,21
01,"Beautiful antique, well located","The building was built in 1800s and newly renovated. However, one can still enjoy the antiquity of it when staying at the hotel. The Bernini Plaza and it's fountain in front of the hotel is also one of the numerous historical attractions in Rome. Hotel room is spacious with all modern amenities.Room was clean but not very well maintained because the standing lamp of my room was not working.I stayed in a classic room with window opened to the street besides the hotel. The hotel has a good location. The famous Spanish Steps is just within 10 minutes walk from the hotel. 
I also had a dinner at the L'Olimpo Rooftop Restaurant during first night of stay. Food was good ,complimented with the perfect wine. However, the breakfast was without choices and the breakfast restaurant was in a chaos in the morning with tour groups waiting in long queues for a breakfast table. Food was also in shortage because the restaurant couldn't handle the number of guests having breakfast at almost the same time.
Other than the unpleasant breakfast experience, I would say that my stay at the Bernini Bristol an enjoying one .",4,2012,11,16
01,Great hotel in the center of Rome,"My first stay at this hotel - absolutely delightful!  Located in the Piazza Barberini in close proximity to Spanish Steps, Trevi Foundation, Metro, public and tour buses.   Room was spacious and very clean and well maintained; staff was very courteous and accommodating.  Breakfast buffet was quite good and no complaints about the coffee.  Did not dine at the rooftop restaurant, but had cocktails - very comfortable seating,",5,2012,11,08
01,"Two visits, two great stays","I have stayed at this wonderful hotel on two occasions, both times with a different young daughter of mine.  In each case, we were treated very well. The rooms are lovely and comfortable, the staff is very welcoming and helpful, and the concierges are terrific. When I requested a restaurant recommendation and reservation far from the usually tourist places, the concierge sent me to a spectacular restaurant in a part of Rome I never would have seen without his suggestion. This will always be my hotel in Rome. Fair prices, wonderful service, great location, beautifully kept hotel.",5,2012,11,05
01,Bad services,"It is a 5 stars hotel. The accomodations and common áreas are good. However the services are not compatible with a 5 stars hotel. Mainly the Breakfast is poor , without many choices. The coffe used to come with 15 minutes delay ( it happened  every day, and we stayed there for 4 days).",3,2012,10,30
01,A Very Nice Hotel for Your Stay in Rome,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol during our recent trip to Italy and found it to be a clean, comfortable, and very pleasant place.  The staff was impeccable; they were courteous, informative, and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay.  They were conversant in a number of languages, including English.  On a number of occasions the concierge not only recommended wonderful restaurants nearby, he practically walked us halfway there to ensure we found them easily!
  
The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms were clean, and the beds were very comfortable.  As others have mentioned, the location of this hotel simply cannot be beat!  Located in the Piazza Barberini, you are just a few blocks away from the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, with the Pantheon and Piazza Navona not too much farther.  The Coliseum and Palatine Hill, as well as the Vatican, can be reached on foot if you enjoy walking, though they are a short taxi ride of under 10 Euros if you don't.  The taxi queue is right out in front of the hotel.  For that matter, you are a mere 1/2 block away from Hard Rock Cafe Rome, so you can get all the tacky t-shirt buying out of the way for your friends back home right off the bat and not have to worry about finding it later.
  
I will admit as others have posted that while the breakfast is wonderful with an incredible spread of items to choose from, including meats and cheeses, eggs, fruits, pastries, cereals, juices, prosecco, etc., the cost is a bit high and we were content most days to hit Pepy's Bar just across the Piazza from the hotel.  The only negative I have about the Hotel Bernini Bristol came on a visit to their rooftop restaurant, l'Olimpo, but I will review them separately.
  
The Hotel Bernini Bristol is priced exactly where you would expect a top-notch hotel in Rome to priced.  If you are on a tight budget, you will probably not choose this place to stay.  But if you are looking for a nice hotel and your budget allows for nice hotels as opposed to hostels, the Hotel Bernini Bristol is a wonderful, comfortable, friendly place to stay while exploring the magic of Rome.",5,2012,10,29
01,Don't rely on the negative reviews.,"If like me you only read the negative reviews to get a true idea about a hotel, in this instance you will be let down. I booked this hotel on a friends recommendation, then I read the reviews. I was very apprehensive prior to my arrival. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were very clean and stylish. The staff were not over familiar but professional, this might be taken by some as rude. The location is fantastic. I hope this helps. ",5,2012,10,27
01,Terrific Location!,"The staff is friendly and knows English. The location is hard to beat - four blocks from the Trevi Fountain, across the street from a subway stop. As with all hotels, you should check into joining their member reward program before you go. Upgrades, free Internet, early and late check in/out are often available to members. ",4,2012,10,24

01,Terrific staff,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights.  The staff, Fernando (front desk manager) Massimiliano (the head concierge) and Giulia (front desk check-in hostess) were all AMAZING to us.  We had a beautiful upgraded room, complimentary bottle of wine, and a platter of cheeses and biscuits when we arrived.  The location of the hotel is the best!  We would definitely stay there again.
I miss you guys!!!! 'Til the next time.......GRAZIE !!!!!",5,2012,10,19
01,Comfortable Hotel located just above all tourist destinations.,"Really helpful staff. Polite and accommodating to Americans. You can walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, even piazza novona. (20 min walk). I liked heading north of hotel to the Villa Borghese park and going to Nationale D'Art Moderna for a different side of Rome. Also nice dog run area near there to see real Romans relaxing after work. So it was worth the extra $$ for our 4 day visit to Rome.",4,2012,10,15
01,Below average,We stayed 3 nights. Front desk staff pleasant  dining room was very average food with poor service. The workout facility downstairs was horrible. I got on one machine and the odor was so bad I couldn't use it. There is really no spa at all. Would not stay here again. ,3,2012,10,13
01,Not even common courtesy,"Stayed 3 nights at the Bernini as part of an ABC Tour. On the third and last day of our time in Rome  the 24 people in our tour were told that our tour company had closed its doors, taking our money and leaving us on our own..  The Bernini offered no assistance, we were told we had to be out in the AM. then, when we checked out they charged us the premium rate for the rooms not the group rate already negotiated since, they informed us, we wereno longer part of a group. Nothing like taking advantage of someone else's  misfortune.",2,2012,10,08
01,Great Deals don't always mean a great experience,"I made arrangements after seeing this hotel on the Luxury Link site. Most of those offerings are quite good but this one was disappointing.
My room was a junior suite on the first floor without much light and with a sofa that sank in the middle. The other chairs were also not comfortable and the desk area was more like a vanity table and with poor wall lighting.
Hotel staff were pleasant and the concierge was very helpful with arranging car service which seems to be one of the real values in Rome.
The breakfast buffet was very nice but service was spotty.
The bathroom was small and the shower leaked badly on the bathroom floor.",3,2012,10,05
01,Poor service,"Hotel is well positioned. Our junior suite was faded but comfortable. Service in the downstairs lounge bar was literally non-existent. Service in the roof bar was inefficient and charmless. A common theme was the grudging service from staff who did not seem interested. Breakfast was fine.  Air conditioning was poor. Concierge services are minimal. The hotel is expensive by any standards. If one were to judge the hotel by similarly priced establishments across Europe, it would be classed as poor. But hotels in major cities in Italy in general are not of a high standard, so a fairer description would be ""adequate"".
",3,2012,10,03
01,Almost Perfect,"We stayed for 5 nights and had a 3-beds junior suite room which was beautiful and large (with 2 bathrooms), but it was almost perfect if we were in other floor , not the 7th floor. We could hear dragging tables and chairs from the top floor restaurant every night , some night up to 2 am. So if want to stay  this hotel AVOID 7th floor !!! Hotel location is perfect . Lots of restaurants around the hotel area. You can walk every where and safe. Concierge and staffs were nice to me.",4,2012,10,03
01,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"From 3hr wait on both of our  2 rooms on check in time (prior guests given very late chek out in our rooms although we were due in) to poor conceirge services (limited maps, bus services, ticket purchase etc), this 5 star hotel was not what we expected or have been used to around the world at all leading brand hotel chains.  Housekeeping did not even remove, wash or exchange wine glasses in our 2 rooms over a 6 nightstay.   Gym equipment is old and worn with little cleaning done over many days.  The mini bar prices are excessive , ie coke 7.50 euro!  Location is fantastic, but there are many cheaper alternatives available in the area.",2,2012,10,02
01,Disappointing,"The pictures of the hotel and rooms were misleading. Our over-priced room looked like an under-rated utility hotel. The only way to enjoy the rooftop view was to eat at their overpriced, unfriendly restaurant. Except for Domonico, the concierge was rude and unhelpful. He would not book a Vatican tour and told us to stand in the line. Their pictures showed a pool which is only for suites. I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2012,09,27
01,Nice hotel but pricey,"Beautiful decor for entrance, hallways, lounge areas and bedrooms. Beautiful view from rooftop bar and restaurant , especially at night. However, very expensive. Breakfast at €25 continental and €35 for cooked breakfast is over the top. Water at €5.50 for a small bottle.
Would i go back. Yes, for a drink and relax with a wonderful night time view of Rome. Lift to the 8 floor is at the rear of the lobby area. The lifts near reception do not go to the roof bar area.",3,2012,09,27
01,Never again,"The  concierge's were very rude and unhelpful (except for Dominico). Nicola needs to retire.  Internet was costly along with all food and drinks.  Upon check-in, we were told that the first hour of internet use was free, thereafter we would have to pay.  The concierge (above) chased us down and insisted we pay immediately.  Also, why charge $12 for a cup of coffee (mediocre). The location was good, but I had to ask for a map, directions, and help of others because the concierge would not say.  When we asked him to help book a tour of the Vatican, he stated that they don't do any bookings of any kind (although specifically mentioned in the room book)
The pool in the pictures is a private pool.",1,2012,09,27
01,Mixed - Make Sure to Get a Modern Room,"Let me start off by saying that I was looking for a 5 star hotel in Rome for my honeymoon and we wanted to stay at the Hotel de Russie but the price was very prohibitive, so we opted for the Bernini Bristol instead. Unlike the other hotels we stayed at in Italy during our trip, this hotel just did not live up to our expectations for a special 5 star hotel. 

First, the rooms vary.  You can easily end up, as we did, in a ""traditional' room that looks like it has not been updated since 1980 and I do not mean that in an endearing way.  We are talking paint chipping, outdated facilities, worn carpets, etc (it was very clean though).  However, if you complain, you can end up in a modern room that is much more finely appointed, for not a lot of hassle.  Our modern suite was comfortable, homey, and clean, and we were happy with it in the end.  But it was still nothing amazing in terms of appointments or comfort, and not up to par for a 5 star hotel.  For example, there were kitchen smells coming in through the air vents at times, and the bathroom was still quite outdated.

Second, while the service here is quite good and the staff is attentive, there are some finicky things that are just again not up to snuff for a 5 star hotel in this day and age.  The WiFi situation is pretty horrendous - you have to go down to the concierge and buy a card for a certain amount of Wifi internet usage. Then if you use the time on that card, you have to go down again in person and get it refilled, etc.  This is pretty weak in this day and age.  Also, its very expensive, and to top it off, it is quite slow.

To recap, if you're looking for true 5-star luxury, this is not the place.  Still, it has a great location, great staff, and its easy getting cabs from the hotel.",4,2012,09,23
01,Disappointing Stay; Rooms Seemed Poorly Maintained,"Let me preface this by saying that I really wanted to like this hotel. I found the concierge to be very accommodating in the sense that they were willing to allow us to switch rooms, but our overall experience here just wasn't great. 

When we arrived we were given a room in the ""historic"" style (when I complained to the concierge, I called it ""old and outdated"" but that seemed to offend). The room was disgusting. The walls had impressions on them where furniture used to be - i.e. outlines of pictures and dressers, etc. The wallpaper was generally stained and gross, as was the carpet. To be fair - at least the bed looked like the sheets had been washed, so that part was ok. We asked to be moved to a new room - and the staff was gracious enough to put is in one of its ""modern"" rooms the next day. Although the modern room looked like it had been restored - the wallpaper and carpet was still dirty and discolored in some places. Based on the quality of the rooms alone I'd just say that this hotel is absolutely over priced. 

We had drinks on the rooftop bar - the service was very slow and we were overcharged for our drinks. When my boyfriend pointed this out, the waiter did apologize and said that it was because he had forgotten how much one of the drinks actually cost. Annoying. 

All this said, this hotel is in a good location and is very near the subway/ bus lines that are necessary for tourists. However, I think there are probably a number of other hotels nearby that are less expensive and that would offer a comparable experience.",2,2012,09,22
01,Nice hotel and good location,"We have been coming to Rome for years, both business and pleasure.  This was our first stay at the Bernini.  We liked the location, but sometimes the staff could be just rude.  We were at the roof top bar, and it took more than 30 minute to get a waiter to take our drink order, all the while the GM was being interview nearby for a local TV show. After the first order it again took forever to get the staff's attention.  We were offered discount drink tickets for the roof bar, but when you read the very fine print, you had to purchase lunch or dinner.  I travel 200,000 miles a year for work, don't treat me that way.  Overall, we would probably go back.",4,2012,09,20
01,HOLIDAY OF A LIFETIME,"Our first trip to rome, very helpful and curtious staff,rooftop bar views supurb food exquisite rooms spacious,cannot wait to return,and by the way what is the name of the prosecco you sell delicious.walks to the trevi fountain and spanish steps a mere stretch of the legs .visits to the collosseum and the forum outstanding,but italys people are its greatest asset. thank you bernini bristol for everything",5,2012,09,20
01,Best nights in Rome start at the rooftop bar,"Although my wife and I stayed at another hotel for a conference, we began the most fabulous evening of our wonderful week in Rome with cocktails at sunset on the hotel rooftop. The enchanting staff went above and beyond to ensure the evening will be one that we will remember the rest of our lives. The history, art, and architecture of Italy are certainly fantastic, but I believe Italy's people are its greatest asset.",5,2012,09,16
01,Lost Panda,"We visited Rome with our 2 young children and had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Bernini Bristol.  The location can't be beat!  However, on our 2nd to last day it could have all changed.  Our youngest son had left his favorite stuffed animal in his bed when we left the room that morning and, upon our return in the evening, his panda was nowhere to be found.  He was inconsolable.  We contacted the front desk and were told that the cleaning staff had left for the day and that we wouldn't be able to check back until the next morning.  The female employee could hear him crying in the background and was very nice; apologizing profusely.  Approximately 10 minutes later there was a knock on our door and there was the missing panda.  The front desk employee had taken it upon herself to go through the dirty sheets to save the day!  What a wonderful gesture.",4,2012,09,16
01,Lovely hotel in Rome,"Stayed at this hotel for the weeked at the end of a cruise and were really delighted with our choice.  It is well located, at the bottom of the Via Veneto and just a short walk from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.  We were given a lovely room on the second floor with a view out over the Piazza Barberini which we expected to be noisy with traffic and people milling around, but we slept exceptionally well.  There is a Metro station right outside the hotel and the tour buses stop just across the road.  The Reception staff were excellent - extremely friendly and helpful and were kind enough to let us keep our room on Sunday for a late check-out with no extra charge.  Breakfast buffet was excellent, with plenty of choices and served in a charming dining room which oozed ""old style"".  Would heartily recommend this hotel for a stay in Rome and we hope to return one day ourselves.",4,2012,09,04
01,Disappointing staff attitude,"I have been coming to this hotel for business purposes for the last 5 years.  Recently, I have been disappointed how I have been treated.  My company pays for my travel and the staff does not treat me like a regular staying customer.  We wanted the concierge to book us tickets for a museum; he told us to simply go to the museum to standby.  He did not want to make the effort to call for us.  Also, I had just witnessed the attendant dialing a number for a customer and transferring the call to the lobby, yet when I asked him to call a local number in the lobby, he told me to use my phone upstairs.  I offered to pay him 2 euros for the phone call; he has lost any business or recommendation from me.",2,2012,09,03
01,All-around positive experience,"Picturesque location, convenient walk to Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. Breakfast buffet was bountiful and cappuccino was delicious! Staff was friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and well-kept. We would stay here again. Sleep quality was average only because our rooms were situated 3 floors up from an all-night bus stop.",4,2012,08,26
01,Fabulous,"We stayed at the Bernini Bristol for a quick getaway.

The hotel is beautiful and reeks of a bygone era of Italian glamour.

The staff were exceptionally helpful and the rooms were beautiful with fresh fruit and champagne on arrival. The views over the city were amazing and the location second to none.

The rooftop restaurant was exquisite.

A must stay.",5,2012,08,26
01,One of the best,"Stayed at this beautiful hotel in early June for our first trip to Italy.  Staff was cordial and very accommodating to anything we needed.  My wife and I could not be more at ease as first timers to this amazing city.  Especially since our airline lost our luggage for 3 days!  Front desk would supply us with updates on our bags everytime we walked in until we finally got it.  

Our room was just your standard setup comfy kind bed, nice furnishings and restroom.  We had a nice side street view and very quite nights, so that was very welcomed.  I will say as a workout enthusiast the gym was more than I was expecting for a European hotel.  Had a decent workout room and ok equipment, but all in all better than nothing.  Loved the location, there are metro stops right out the door that take you anywhere you want to go in Rome.  Not to forget the easy walk to Spanish steps and trevi fountain.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2012,08,24
01,Its the view of Rome from the roof bar that makes this hotel special,"Rome is the home of all things ancient and beautiful, likewise Roman hotels tend to be full of marble, flock wallpaper and ornate curtains.  The Bristol is no exception.  We stayed in a classic room which was a little worn but clean, spacious with a good sized bathroom and a very comfortable bed.  The aircon was quiet but you had the option to open the windows which is comforting as few people enjoy sleeping in a vacuum. We also had a look at the more modern rooms which were minimalistic and simple, but lacked character.  Breakfast was super, nice choice, good hot selection and excellent cappuccino.  The bar area on the roof makes this hotel special and was the reason why my husband booked.  A chilled glass of Frascati or a tall Peroni overlooking Rome is super at the end of a hot day of touring. However, the bar area is very small and once you have more 8 people seated there is no room for anyone else to sit. The restaurant is extensive with an open air restaurant area situated next to the pretty bar, but we were told we couldn't sit there with our drinks as the restaurant was closed.  That was pity as it wouldn't have been a huge inconvenience.  Nobody tried to make it a pleasant experience or find a suitable alternative therefore we left, the bar lost our custom and we only used the roof bar once.  
We did find that the hotel staff were either incredibly pleasant (the Concierge was a delightful older gentleman who was very courteous and the young female receptionist whose name started with G couldnt have been more helpful) or completely waspish.  Daniel with the razor sharp cheekbones clearly found foreign visitors a complete source of irritation!  Perhaps the heat of Rome in August tries everyone’s patience, but it was disappointing to be made to feel as if we were tolerated.  Finally, the hotel is so close to everything (Trevi, Spanish Steps etc) so it was a great location.  Perhaps avoid August, unless you have to travel in school holidays.",4,2012,08,21
01,Nice hotel in a good location,"Me and my wife stayed here on aug 12-18 , 2012. The hotel was situated in a nice area with many shops and touristy areas in piazza barberini with a nice view. Its a 10 minute walk from trevi fountain, and 15 minutes to the spanish steps or the pantheon. The room was nice and spacious and the staff was courteous and helpful. No real complaints except for these few. 1. The picture of the pool is not for general guests, its only for a specific suite not for the general hotel use. 2. As others explained this day and age having to pay hourly for internet use is ridiculous. I payed almost 35 euros for internet. 3. And lastly the roof top bar while beautiful with a great view is a little pricy, i had ONE bottle of local beer and it was 8 euro, restaurants down the street had the same bottle for 3.50 - 4.00 euro

OTher than I would probably stay again providing i couldn't find something better in the same price range.",4,2012,08,20
01,Good location,"It is situated in piazza Barberini,very close to via Veneto.The metro station is a minute walk,piazza di Spagna is 15 minutes walk.The hotel is in a typically classic style,the staff is o.k,breakfast is good.",3,2012,08,12
01,Best Hotel in Rome!!!,"We stayed at the Bernini Bristol at the end of July and it was unforgettable experience! Hotel is peacefully located in the heart of Rome(minutes away from all major attractions) and overlooks beautiful Bernini square with numerous shops and cafes. We booked Junior Suite and were kindly upgraded to presidential suite upon check in. We were greeted with complimentary wine bottle and fruits, which was very nice touch to a breath taking room and view. The hotel exterior and interior is very beautifully designed and rooftop restaurant provides you with an amazing dining experience. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, accommodating any request with all their best efforts. This is the best hotel to stay in Rome!!!",5,2012,08,08
01,Amazing stay!,"We recently stayed here for a few nights during our honeymoon and we loved it! There was a bottle of wine in our room and the staff was terrific in helping us get acquainted. They had specialized maps of Rome that were centered on the hotel so we always knew how to get back. The room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was INCREDIBLE (best coffee I have had in my life!).

My one issue was the wireless internet connection. We paid 3 euro for a 1-hour wifi connection card but the connection was awful no matter where you were in the hotel and out of that hour I maybe got 7-8 minutes of internet time as the connection would go out within 30 seconds if it did connect at all. For a hotel this amazing in so many other aspects, I expected better from their wifi offering when paying 3 euro for 1 hour.",5,2012,08,07
01,Great Hotel,"If you want a luxury experience in Rome, this is the place!  Great location - close to Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps.  Concierge services were very helpful.  Room was beautiful.  Breakfast was typical European breakfast but the presentation made it seem much nicer.",5,2012,08,06
01,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is a true gem.... its beauty and its perfect location are just the perfect complement to its exquisite staff .... I just can't wait to return.... It is a special feeling when you know you feel at home whenever you stay there....

Unique, to say the least....",5,2012,08,05
01,great location,Wonderful location to explore Rome on foot for a while each evening after a day of touring.  Broken lights were repaired in our room quickly by maintenance.  Many good restaurants nearby. Nice buffet breakfast.  Can't wait to return!,5,2012,08,01
01,"Good location, nice property","My husband and I stayed here for one night before going to Umbria. I chose the hotel because of the listing on Small Luxury Hotels website. It has a good location, clean and spacious rooms, good breakfast buffet. The furnishings are a little run-down and I had to purchase multiple internet access cards to access the wifi (not convenient for doing several hours of work). The rooftop bar/restaurant was very nice, although they had very slow service. We did not walk around the neighborhood so I can't comment on the location. All together a better than average experience in Rome, but not the best.",4,2012,07,29
01,"Close to Train, bus station and subway",We stayed here for 3 nights and found the rooms clean and quiet. The airconditioning worked well  and the location at Piazza Barberini was convenient to access the Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain.  Ther were several good restaurants nearby. Having the subway stop nearby meant more time at the sights and less time finding our hotel from the last stop.,4,2012,07,28
01,"great location, nice terrasse but is this it already?","I stayed at the Bernini for business purpose. Location is great, very close to Trevi fountain and Plaza d'Espagna. I had a nice ""old style"" room, it was clean but not special in any regard. Even though windows looked rather new, noise isolation was a real issue. I could well hear bus and noise from the neighbouring restaurant (...and in Italy they don't close at 11pm). Service was ok, but not overly nice. The Terrasse is really nice, but service is proportionally slow. It took them 30 minutes to serve me a Gin Tonic and two couple left the place exasperated to have to wait so long. An american lady even waved at a water for at least 20 seconds and he simply ignored her. I don't know if it's normal in other ""tourist""hotels in Rome, but having to pay for Wifi is simply no longer acceptable for business hotels. Breakfast was good. Finally, perhaps I misunderstood the concierge, but the gym only opening at 9 am is also not acceptable.",3,2012,07,20
01,Very good service and clean,"Concierge and front office staff were very helpful. Doorman, porter and breakfast were polite Room was very clean which was refreshed again in the afternoon. Breakfast good but expensive and not too many choice. We extended our check out up to 1400hrs free of charge but to extend up to 1800hrs we were asked for an extra 150 euros, which was quite expensive.",4,2012,07,18
01,Top Hotel in great location,"Lovely hotel located centrally on Piazza Barberini. Close to station and bus stop. 
Must eat at rooftop restaurant L'Olimpo for the best views across Rome.",5,2012,07,09
01,Very Italian - Very Good Hotel in Superb Location,"We have visited the Bernini Bristol in Rome a couple of times over the last few years and it never fails to impress. The staff are very helpful and courteous - the decor of the hotel is full of character. On this visit I had requested a room overlooking Piazza Barberini which unfortunately wasnt available - however as compensation we were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely treat. Fresh Fruit and Cheese were awaiting us on arrival at our room. 
The Rooftop bar has stunning views and a lovely atmosphere
I dont think you will be disappointed by the overall experience.
The hotels location is also ideal for seeing Rome on foot! It is a 5 minute walk from the Spanish Steps and about 10 Minutes away from Trevi Fountain- nothing is that far away. Restaurants around the hotel are very good and well worth a visit",4,2012,07,02
01,Nice Hotel,"Bernini is a great hotel in Rome, the service was great as well as the hotel itself.",4,2012,06,18
01,Excellent hotel in Good Location,"Nice hotel in good relatively quiet neighborhood. Easy walk to many restaurants & attractions. Ver close to Barberini metro station. Rooms well kept & helpful staff
Meeting rooms are small but good. Also used by some of the US air crews. I would stay there again.",4,2012,06,07
01,"Nice View, helpful Staff","We stayed in one of the modern rooms, very small, mattress not comfortable. Shower leaked all over the floor.  It must have been going on for a while because the bathroom door frame was rotting out.  Had dinner at the rooftop restraunt, neither I or my wife enjoyed our meals, she had the shrimp with brown sugar carmalized something or other, the shrimp came with heads on and were VERY fishy tasting.  The tiramisu wasn't tara, or misu.  Chocolate sauce on tiramisu?  Oh, and we ate outside and the gentleman at the next table lit up a cigar for us all to enjoy.  The staff at the hotel was very helpful in arranging our very early morning departure and even brought me coffe in the lobby at 4:30 am.  I'd stay there again but not eat on the roof.",3,2012,05,28
01,Location is nice,"The front desk is realtively helpful. The internet is good. The rooms are rather sparse but functional.  Bernini is a 10 minute walk from the major tourist spots, yet in a residential area.",3,2012,05,25
01,Good but need to improove some things,"An excelent hotel in a very convenient location, walking distance to many atractions, and by barberini metro station that will help to visit the other atractions!!  Good rooms, helpful and polite reception staff, but I dont understad the policy of the hotel in some aspects. First of all for the price level of the hotel I think that is unacceptable that for internet access you have to pay 3 euros for 1 (one!!!) hour or 7 for three! And then if you need more you have to go to the reception to buy more.....
When you pay 500 per day I thik that this charge is only anoying and stupid. Ie easily could be 520 AND INCLUDE internet. When you are in Rome you dont download movies but you have unfortunatelly to check your mails, sometimes to reply..
An other thing that I noticed during my last stays ( this hotel is  (was) one of my favorites in rome so i visit it 3-4 times a year) is that they sarted  to not include breakfast in the room price so if you need inhouse breakfast you have to spare a nother 35euros per person (definitely not worth this price).",4,2012,05,23
01,Very nice property at Piazza Barberini,"We went there at end of April for a 3 days stay.
The hotel was very nice and the front desk staff very helpful and we had a quick check in. We stayed on the 6th floor so we had a beautiful view of the city. The hotel is easy accessible from the airport by the metro as it is next to the metro station or via taxi. The metro station was very essential as you could get to any part of the city easily. One good thing is also that the hotel is so central that you can walk easily to Fontana di Trevi, Piazza del Popolo or Piazza Venezia or the Spanish Steps. As we are a couple who likes to walk, we almost did our sight seeings by foot. The room was spacious and clean, quite and the bed was nice. The bathroom was a bit small but very clean with nice bathroom amenities in it. Towels were changed on a daily basis and our sheets every day also. The breakfast was rich and very tasty. There were only some minor things the hotel should take care of like the curtains on our room has some small stains and the elevator is a bit old but in general you cannot say bad things of the hotel. The only issue is that you have to pay for the wifi in your room. I would surely recommend this hotel to friend and people as we had a pleasant stay and the people always helped us if we had a question.",4,2012,05,15
01,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Rome!,"With Rome being our first stop in Italy, the Hotel Bernini Bristol provided the perfect welcome! Sitting in the heart of the Piazza Barberini, you are right in the center of everything. We walked to Trevi Fountain, the Roman Forum, Colosseum, and just about all the hot spots. The hotel itself was wonderful! We had a great view of the city, overlooking a fabulous rooftop Ristorante Pizzeria. It wasn't the most amazing room, but it was accommodating for us and plenty spacious. Very clean and nice amenities. I definitely suggest the rooftop restaurant at Hotel Bernini Bristol. Amazing food and spectacular, panoramic views of all of Rome! Fernando, one of the concierge, was amazing and SO very helpful! He suggested a few places for us to go, and he did not disappoint. Be sure to try the Tritone Trattoria, 2-3 blocks from the hotel. Great food and ambiance.",4,2012,05,10
01,highly recommended,"stayed from the 20th April 2012.  All we could wish for and more.

Twin Room spacious and very comfortable. From reception to Bar and Restaurant customer service excellent.

Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice from traditional cooked to the meats and cheeses for a continental.",5,2012,05,06
01,This is not a 5 star hotel!,"We have just come back from a birthday trip to Rome.  Our first visit.  The day before we left the UK, my husband phoned the hotel to let them know it was my birthday, and to see if they would upgrade our room. The receptionist said she would let the manager know. We had a double deluxe room overlooking the Piazza!  Room 202.  It was a great location, but not a great hotel!  On our arrival, they gave us a 15% discount for the A la carte restaurant in the hotel! Well, 1) the reviews of the restaurant on Trip advisor were not great, and 2) when in Rome, why would we want to eat in a Meditierranean restaurant! We wanted to eat what the locals eat, and eat where they eat! So no room upgrade, and not even a mention of it.  They were not fully booked either.

Our room was dated, and so was the bathroom, although the size of both was good. There was a shower in the bath that was OK, and a ridiculous walk in shower next to it.  It was so small, and the shower didn't work very well at all, so we didn't use it once. Given the fact that 4 nights cost us £1000, I would have expected better.  It was really noisy in the room, I understand the piazza was quite noisy, but the housekeeping team were constantly banging about & shouting from quite early in the morning.  Also, I have to say, this was the worst bed I have slept in!!! I did not once sleep through the night, neither did my husband. Also, even with the air con, the room was very stuffy, once you closed the windows at night.  Every morning I woke up with a sore neck, or shoulder or back!  I left Rome feeling exhausted.

On the Saturday, the day after my birthday ( we had bought a bottle of vintage Dom Perignon at the airport) we didn't want to sit in our stuffy room & drink it, so my husband phoned the concierge & asked if we could take it up to the roof garden.  He said that would be fine, so we took it up.  We found a table easily as it was only about 5pm, and there was hardly anyone up there.  My husband went into the restaurant, and as no staff were around, he took a couple of glasses off one of the tables set for dinner.  Then one of the waiters came out and asked him what he thought he was doing!!!!  Sorry, but haven't they ever heard the saying the customer is always right?? and given that we were paying £1000 for our 4 night stay, which did not include breakfast by the way!  My husband told him he had been given permission for us to bring our champagne up, and asked him what his problem was.  He didn't say much after that, and eventuallt brought us an ice bucket.

The view from the roof garden is really stunning, but that's not really enough!

We have stayed in several 5 star hotels over the years, and I'm afraid this just doesn't deserve the rating.  The carpets & decor throughout most of the building needed to be replaced, and as other people have also said, the lifts are really slow, and there are only 2 of them.

We had a fantastic time in Rome, and would go back, but not to this hotel.",3,2012,05,02
01,Very enjoyable stay. Great Hotel,"We had a great time.  There was some confusion an a small hiccup mat the time of check-in but the manager made everything ok immediately. The hotel is centrally located and just about everything is walking distance.  The train station is close as well. There is a subway stop outside the hotel and we took it a few times. We felt very safe.  I haven't been to Rome in many many years therefore I had several questions for the concierge.  They were wonderful and very helpful from making me aware of all the points of interest to making dinner reservations at a lovely restaurant in the hills that overlook Rome to finding me Olio, napkins, and silverware at 2am. I would absolutely stay there again.  Umberto and Massimiliano were wonderful and a huge help. ",5,2012,04,28
01,Stayed here with Adventures by Disney,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July 2011 as part our our tour.  The hotel was old and elegant.  We had 2 connecting rooms.  It took a while for our rooms to be ready - they kept saying they were refreshing them.  When we finally got in we could see why.  The kids' room was great - our room was nice and clean, but the previous guests must have sat in the room with the windows closed and smoked all day and night.  The room had a very strong smoke odor - that was obviously what they were trying to clear out.  We didn't bother asking to move so don't know how accomodating they would have been.  The dinner and the breakfasts were very good.  I would not have paid the going rate though if it had not been part of our tour.  Overall, a nice hotel.

Our big beef was that they charged for internet.  How ridiculous that a high end hotel would do that when free internet is pretty much standard at lower star hotels.  We did without!

Great location.",4,2012,04,24
01,Nice hotel with lovely rooftop restaurant,Very traditional hotel with the only problem always a slow checkin. Rooftop bar and restaurant is awesome and the location is great,4,2012,04,22
01,"""Close to Everything""","Rome- A walking Museum.  Stayed at Bernini Bristol Hotel. Nice staff, speak English. Nice decor. Old elegance and tapestry. Comfortable clean rooms with robes provided. Nice,relaxing view from rooftop restaurant/bar. (indoor/outdoor). Some evenings there's a piano player. Located at (Square) -Piazza Barberini, where you can find a Bernini Fountain and sculpture.

Hotel is closest to Trevi Fountains, within minutes to Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Wedding cake- Emmanuel Vittorio, Coliseum etc. 
Metro Barberini is in front of hotel and only three metro stops to St. Peters and Vatican area. Additional 10min walk to Vatican/Sistine Chapel or 45min continuous walk from hotel, winding through Rome. (St. Peter's Basilica -Remember to wear appropriate clothing, cover shoulders)

Hotel has small gym,  few cardio equip, limited free weights/bench. Somewhat functional universal machine. Spa.

Hotel provides internet at reasonable prices or free Wi-Fi at Pepy's Bar across Piazza Barberini, in front of Bernini Sculptor.  Friendly waiters, speak English. You can have good coffee, sandwich, salad, pasta, glass of wine and people watching.

Hotel Bernini offers a nice continental breakfast buffet.

Dinner- If you don't feel like being around a lot of noise and want great food at *reasonable prices, then from hotel, cross Piazza Barberini, direction of Bar Pepe, turn left, then immediately right, down a quiet alley. Almost at the end, on the left is a small family owned restaurant ""Da Olympia"". (Might be closed on Mon.) Delicious food, great pizza, pasta and *antipasti bar.  Family speak very little English but nice to tourists. 

Re: Tipping. All restaurants charge a copperto (service charge) but 10-15% is customary for good service. Some places charge more (service charge) to sit outside.

Another area nearby Rome main attractions with lots of good restaurants at reasonable prices is in ""Trastevere"". 

Reasonably expensive restaurant with nice view, quiet, indoor/outdoor, romantic,  is the street at top of Spanish Steps, turn left, you'll find restaurant *Ciampini"". 

Best gelato is Giolitti ! Been around since early 1900. Close to Pantheon. Might see lines but please wait!! It's worth it ! Be creative, Mix any flavor. Yummy! I like to walk to the Trevi Fountain afterwards, sit relax while enjoying my ""Giolitti's"" gelato.

Currency exchange- from hotel, turn right, behind metro entrance across street, next to corner restaurant. ATM machines outside hotel door to the left. 

Center Rome is approx 40min good traffic and up to 1.15hrs bad traffic from main Leonardo Da Vinci airport.  Located on the metro Blue B- Line.
There are buses avail.  or by train approx 30min. to Main Metro - ""Termini"".
Approx 10euros o/w. 0630-1130pm.
Termini is 2 stops from Metro -Piazza Barberini, (Red Line A) where you can find Hotel Bernini. 

Many side trips possible. I enjoyed the quiet, historic, medieval town of ""Castel Gandolfo"". Pope's summer palace. Easy to get to and within 30 from Rome- Termini metro train. (Buy ticket at machine or newspaper/tobacco shop). Get off at last stop and walk to top, uphill. Overlooks the beautiful Lake Albano, nice sunsets, nice restaurants.

Ciao...Enjoy!!",4,2012,04,21
01,Great service and very friendly to children too,"We recently stayed at the Bernini Bristol with 3 children aged 6, 12 and 14 and had two connecting deluxe rooms, which were spacious and very convenient, overlooking the fountain on the piazza. Perfect location in central Rome with amazing views from the rooftop bar. The gym was also good and easy to use. Breakfast had a great selection with fresh fruit and cooked food regularly topped up and replaced. Service from the concierge and hotel staff in all areas of the hotel was excellent and they were very friendly to the children. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return one day.",5,2012,04,08
01,A Good Stay,"Recently visted Rome went with BA holidays for 4 nights stayed at Bristol Hotel, very good clean hotel good breakfast, bit of a walk down to the centre of Rome but plenty of sights to view on way , BA were excelent with the booking and the attention we received at Gatwick and also on the flight would definitely recommend a short break 
,",5,2012,04,02
01,Romantic Rome,"We stayed at the Bernini in January 2012, It was a Fantastic Hotel, the rooms were so big, ours looked over the Piazza , so most afternoons we opened the windows , and took all the atmosphere in , the staff were very help full , we had a late check out on the last day they let us stay till 3.00pm free of charge, also when were went to Sorento they kept our bags over night and then put them back into the same room when we returned , nothing was a problem, the Breakfast was amazing so much variety, only comment would be if you were buying a bottle of wine to take back to the room and take in the view, maybe pack a corkscrew as there isn't any in the Bar Fridge, but that is just a tip , the Hotel was  so central to everything , would stay there again",5,2012,03,27
01,"Lovely Location, Lovely decor!","I stayed here 2 nights while my bf played rugby here. It was in an excellent location. The staff were nice and the roof top is great, The only things I really was un happy with was that the rooms were so hot all day and night and the AC wasn't working properly, however, this is just a hiccup and can happen at any hotel. The shower pressure also wasn't amazing in my room. I really like the decor as I felt I was staying in a hotel back in the early 1900s. It's very pretty! :) I loved the toilettries as well. Smell wonderful!",3,2012,03,20
01,Some things to be aware of,"Overall a pleasant, well located and comfortable hotel.  However not quite as good as it cold be. Some of these issues may not put everyone off, but we would probably think twice for the following reasons.

Rooms - good size, comfortable bed, clean and good quality. But no tea/coffe facilities; dificult to regulate temperature; no power sockets at desk or by bed for charging phones etc; no alarm clock; tv only had 2 english language channels, CNN and BBC world; no bedisde switch for bright over bed lights; shower dificult to regulate. 

Breakfast - limited selection, no fresh hot food, ran out of sausages and bread, limited fresh fruit.  Bear in mind they charge eur 36 for this, realy dont bother unless it is included in your room rate.

On the plus side, the location is excellent, very comfortable reception areas, helpful reception staff.

Probably wouldnt stay again, which is a shame as could be great with little extra effort.",3,2012,02,19
01,Too expensive for the experience!,"We stayed at this hotel in Dec 2011 for two nights with our two children.  They required us to have two rooms.  Cost for a room - US$350.  The hotel is old and beautiful but that's about where it ends.  The rooms were very basic: bed, closet, tv.  No balcony, no view, no air conditioning.  We'd leave our window open to cool the room down and the maid would close it so our room was always stuffy.  The bathrooms were fine but it took some serious work to get hot water to come out of the shower head.  Sub par gym.  VERY expensive b'fast if you ate at the hotel.  Front desk staff were not very helpful.  The doormen were lovely, probably the best thing about this hotel.",2,2012,02,02
01,The Magic of Rome,"My husband and I stayed her for 2 nights in early November 2011 and it was a wonderfully classic hotel. The Porter was a real gentleman and helped us with anything we required. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. Our room was on the 4th floor with a small balcony where it was fasinating just to sit and watch the Italian traffic.............obeying the road rules (I dont think there are anu LOL) Great view, close to Trevy Fountain, spanish steps and short walk to main shopping streets. Taxi rank was right outside the front door.Bed was reasonable but whenever we go on holiday nothing like your owm bed at home.  Room was great as was the buffet breakfast. Would definately stay again and highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

01,"Good location, rooms okay.","Our family of four just stayed here for three nights.  We had two connecting rooms, which were a very nice size and gave us plenty of space.  The rooms were very average and needed some sprucing up.  It was very difficult to control the climate in the rooms, as well.  The half door for the shower did not provide enough of a barrier and we continuously flooding the bathroom floor.  The staff was very nice and breakfast was good each morning.  We also loved the location.",4,2011,12,30
01,Roman Holiday,"I stayed here for a portion of my honeymoon, and I have to recommend it to anyone who is staying in Rome. It is the perfect location to see all the sights, lots of shopping and restaurants close by, and a lot to see and do. Many of the sights are in walking distance, and public transportation is very easily accessible. The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful, it exceeded our expectations. The rooms were a fair size (for a European hotel) and very comfortable and clean. The food was excellent (we only had a chance to have the breakfast buffet, but it was great even by north american standards). The view from the room and from breakfast was lovely. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2011,12,15
01,"Classic hotel, well located","Location of that hotel very close to Fontanna di Trevi and to Spanish Steps should be treated as a main attraction.
Porter welcoming guests is a great adventage of this hotel: elegant gentelman, with a kind smile, leave very positive impression of that stay. A bit heavy interior but quite obvious for Rome with its long history. My room and room of a colegue had definately too high heating - even with open windon it was hard to sleep. Breakfast was fine - like for Italian bufet even more than average. Lift goes very slowly - keep it in mind in you are in a hurry. Generally speaking location very close to the metro station turned to be the biggest attraction. Unfortunately I had no time to visit a restaurant on top floor but probably it would be a nice impression, even could rise the opinion of 1 point more - maybe somebody can check it and write in own review.",3,2011,12,13
01,Fantastic location,"We were upgraded to a junior suite when the hotel was told that were celebrating our wedding anniversary.
Nice size suite.
Main downside:  the bed - two singles joined together.  My side seemed to be on wheels and would move from under me if i was sitting in bed. The bed moved away from the headboard and my pillows kept falling down.  Did inform the hotel reception but nothing changed.  Far from ideal.  Didnt try food as it was v v expensive and there are so many other options nearby to try.",3,2011,12,11
01,"25th Anniversary Trip - November 16, 2011","We stayed for 3 nights 11/16 - 11/19/2011. Because it was our 25th anniversary we were upgraded to room 105. Great view of the piazza and the fountain. However, because we were on the 1st floor it was a bit noisy, especially on Friday night.  The room was very large and extremely clean. Breakfast was fantastic with a large selection. The location if fantastic. We were just minutes from everything. The only time we needed a taxi was to the Colosseo and the Vatican. We will definitely stay at this location on our next visit to Rome.",4,2011,11,21
01,Loved the location,"Went to Rome for a 4 days weekend. We had room 211, non-smoking room. Room was a good size, the bathroom was spotless, only missing a curtain to prevent the water from sprinkling all over the place while showering...
Breakfast was great with a buffet, fresh fruit, cakes, croissants, breads, yoghurt, eggs, etc..
Service at the reception was very friendly and helpful at all times. 
The location is perfect walking distance from all majors attractions and shopping areas. We walked all over the city, our feet were dead after four days, but what a wonderful weekend!",4,2011,11,14
01,"Fountains, fountains","If you're lucky you'll get a room looking at the Bernini Fountain.  The best part of this hotel is that it's within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps.  There are lots of restaurants close, but don't get caught in one of the many tourist restaurants.  Make sure you get some pizza.

Be prepared, the rooms are small, the refrigerator stands by itself with the tv on top, but you're in Rome.",4,2011,11,13
01,Just OK,"We stayed for 3 nights while seeing all the great art and history of Rome.  We found the Bernini Bristol to have a great location, but so-so elsewhere and staffing in the bar and Terrace restaurant was hard to find, inattentive and not interested on serving their clientele.  Very disappointing.  The staff at the concierge desk and hotel desk were fine and provided us very satisfactory service.",3,2011,11,05
01,Great location!,"I chose this hotel as the tail end of our wedding anniversary trip to Italy.  The hotel is located within short walking distance to everywhere and is right in front of Metro station and a taxi stand. I did extensive research to find the best deal available before booking, and this time ""I Prefer"" perks with Amex worked the best.  We enjoyed 4 nights in a Deluxe Room overlooking Piazza Barberini.  Despite the fact that the hotel is right in front of a busy traffic circle, our room was very quiet. Be sure to include the wonderful breakfast buffet.  Unfortunately, there was mold started to grow on the wall right above the door inside the bathroom in which triggered my allergies.  Other than that, our stay at Bernini Bristol was wonderful.  We highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a great hotel experience in Rome.",4,2011,10,31
01,Great location - Great roof terrace - Average room,"The Bristol Hotel is a perfectly acceptable tourist hotel, being ideally situated for the 'must-see' sights.

The staff were friendly and the lobby is comfortable.  The roof top bar and restuarant have great views and are very comfortable.  However, the room was 'ok' at best, and certainly not one would expect from a 5-star restaurant.  In fact, it was a bit tired (wardrobes didn't shut properly and the plug sockets were fragile and precarious).

However, the rate was reasonable and provided a better guide as to what to expect.",3,2011,10,20
01,Exquisite!,"Everything about the Hotel Bernini Bristol was wonderful starting with the friendly staff who greeted us in a chorused welcome.  Location, location, location, walking distance to everywhere important.  Room lovely.  Decor of hotel, like being in an art gallery.  Breakfast was just glorious from the baby fresh, to the prosecco on the table.  After a 24 hour trip, door to door, we decided on the roof top restaurant - outstanding view over Roma at night, outstanding service and outstanding food so good that we decided on having dinner there the last night.",5,2011,10,17
01,Roman Luxury,"Hotel Bernini Bristol provided another elegant stay while visiting Italy, providing its guests with many amenities.  The furnishings are beautifully appointed, it's lobby offers a glamous sitting area for the comfort of guests and its staff was very accommodating.  Our room looked out to the Plaza Barberini and its fountain.  We enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate a return visit.",5,2011,10,15
01,Not a Real 5 Star - a 3-4 star,"The Bernini is a nice hotel, in a good location, at the end of the Via Veneto, an easy walk to Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and more. The roof top restaurant has a beautiful view of the city. We stayed in a ""Superior"" Room, supposedly better than a ""Classic"" room. It was very small with little storage space. The A/C did not work well. The was very little water pressure and a hair dryer with little power, which was a problem for my wife, who could not wash or dry her hair. I suspected the """"5 Stars"" was suspect when we arrived at the hotel and had to drag in our own luggage. Most of the time there was no doorman, or maybe the doorman was busy doing something else.We had previously stayed at the St. Regis, which is a TRUE 5 star hotel. There is no comparison. Of course the Bernini is much less expensive, and the old adage that you pay for what you get is true. This is not a bad hotel, it is just really a 3, maybe 4 star hotel if you're pushing it. I think it gets 5 stars because it has a Spa, Restaurant, 24 hour room service, and raters give a lot of points to these things. I also believe there are some "" 5 star"" type suites in the hotel with terraces, although we didn't stay in one. My wife liked the linens/sheets, very good quality.",4,2011,09,27
01,Good location (and that's about it),"I stayed at Bernini Bristol in September for a few days. I don't mind expensive hotels as long as they live up to the expectations but this was not the case.

The staff were more or less helpful, depending on who you spoke to but overall I felt like many of them didn't really care. All of them smile politely but that's about it.

The rooms and amenities look expensive but rather old. For example, there are occasional lightbulbs that are off, the air conditioning was making a funny noise unless it was set to a minimum, the extractor fan in my bathroom didn't work at all. The elevators are small and slow, you have to wait for ages for them to arrive.

The internet access is just as expensive as the room is (something like 7 euros for the first 3 hours and 24 euros for further 24 hours) and it's horrible: you have to log in using prepaid cards you have to carry with you and the speed isn't that great, really. Every time you close the lid of your laptop, you have to log in again... and then log out, so that your credit didn't run out. Sometimes it just doesn't work. Given that I spent a lot of time online, it was a pain.

The roof terrace offers really nice views, I must say (my colleagues and I spent a few evenings there) but the service doesn't live up to the expectations. On more than one occasion we were wandering around looking for somebody to take the order or to give us a bottle opener for the beer they served.

The breakfast, even though there were all the things you would expect in a five star hotel, was really nothing special. When I pointed out to a member of staff that there's water dripping from the ceiling above the self-serving area, she nodded as if she knew and didn't care and left without saying anything. Since it wasn't my first day there, I wasn't surprised.

Overall, I felt like it was a waste of money. It looks glittery from the outside but it's deceptive.",2,2011,09,24
01,"Great location, almost 5 star.","We spent 3 nights in August visting Rome. The location was very good for sightseeing. The staff were all very friendly, helpful and attentive. The room was very nice, but not 5 star. About standard amount of space and the furnishings were updated , clean and attractive. The bathroom was a standard size bathroom, but upscale. Marble and granite and nice amenities. The Hotel is a charming old building, so that is probably why the rooms aren't more spacious. Everything was updated and the Lobby was beautiful. Our room was very warm and we were told that there was a central control and we weren't able to control the air individually in our room. To be fair, Rome was having an unusual heat wave and it may have been that the air just couldn't keep up. It was over 100 degrees the days we were there . The breakfast room was lovely and the breakfast was excellent. The service was very good also. There was a beautiful rooftop terrace for drinks and dinner. We had a drink up there each night after sightseeing. It was lovely. We ate dinner there one night and the food was not very good, it was very expensive and the waiters were not very attentive both for dinner and for drinks. The waiters would disappear or would be talking on their phones or to each other. Other guests experienced the same thing. Overall our stay was really nice and we would stay there again. We would eat elsewhere however for dinner.",4,2011,09,11
01,Fantastic Views over Eternal City,"The first thing to note about this hotel is that it’s not really a five star hotel compared to other five star hotels in other cities around the world – four star maybe but definitely not five.  Having said that, for Rome it probably is five stars.  Nevertheless, the hotel building does look impressive both from the outside and its marble foyer inside.  It also has a beautiful rooftop terrace restaurant and bar with wonderful views of the eternal city – probably one of its best features.  Same parts of the hotel (carpets, wallpaper, etc) and some of the furniture looked a bit worse for wear but nothing really bad. The hotel lift is probably its worst feature and desperately needs replacing.  The staff were all courteous  and helpful. 
The hotel’s position was not as central as I had hoped.  Although very close to major sights such as Trevi Fountain (about 5 minutes’ walk) and the Spanish Steps (7 minutes’ walk), it was much further away from others such as the Colosseum, Campo dei Fiori, Piazza Navona, etc.  The Metro station was right across the road from the hotel however because Rome has only two lines (A & B) you can’t get to all the tourist sites using the Metro (75 minutes trip cost 1 Euro; 24 hr. ticket cost 4 Euro).  Also they only run until 11 p.m. which is ludicrous given that Italians don’t go out to dinner until 10 p.m.  Metro tickets were also good on buses and these went everywhere.  The only problem (but fun) being working out where this was. There is also a taxi stop outside the hotel and taxis were relatively cheap.  It cost us 10 Euro to get from Colosseum to the Hotel.
I booked a 3 night Dolce Vita weekend package directly through the hotel’s website (after comparing prices through TripAdvisor) which included a Piazza Barberini view room, early check-in, late check-out and continental breakfast.  However, on arrival at the hotel at 10 a.m. our room was not ready.  We were told that the housekeeping staff were just about to clean the room and to come back in two hours. However, we had to wait until 1:30 p.m. before we were able to get into our room which was disappointing.  However, we were able to extend our check-out by a further 2 hrs until 2 p.m.  
The continental breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant on the mezzanine floor (not rooftop restaurant which would have been so much better).  It was your typical European fare - nothing outstanding. Our room itself was large with a king size bed and a beautiful Juliet balcony that overlooked the Piazza Barberini with views out to St. Peter’s and the Vatican - a very romantic view indeed (see photo) and worth staying here for (I did request a high floor and got the 5th floor).   There was also a large entry and sizeable marble bathroom.  The bed was a bit on the firm side and the pillows a bit on the soft side – but I always travel with my own pillow so this didn’t bother me.  I was worried about the air conditioning given the reviews that I had read on TripAdvisor prior to booking , however we had absolutely no problems.  In fact, the air conditioning was the best we had on our entire trip especially given that it was a blistering 39 degrees outside.  
At check-out we were surprised to learn that our package also included a transfer to the airport (which would have cost 40 Euro by Taxi as this is a set fare) and we ended up feeling like rock stars driving to the airport in the back of a new Mercedes sedan with blacked out windows and a driver wearing a suit and cap.  It was a really fantastic way to end our three week European holiday.",4,2011,09,02
01,"Nice personnel, but a very tired hotel, in need of updating and upgrading","The service personnel are very nice, and the breakfast buffet is excellent.  The Hotel is in definite need of updating and upgrading.  The rooms are dark, with very small and crowded bathrooms.  The lobby needs new sofas, and the dining room carpet is threadbare and dirty.",3,2011,08,30
01,NO AIR-CONDITIONING IN OUR ROOM! HOT! HOT! HOT!,We stayed at this hotel 3 nights because it is considered a five star hotel (expensive) and were celebrating our 40th anniversary. After arriving we called repeatedly to the desk to get our room cool. The maintenance man came and said it was just hot outside. Only the fan was blowing and it was miserable. (Outside 96) Upon departure I complained again about the room and the clerk showed me a list of approx. 30 rooms that had no air-conditioning. Apparently one of the compressors was out. No compensation was made on our behalf. Bottom line- call and see if the air is working before you go- or even better- stay somewhere else!,1,2011,08,09
01,Bernini Bristol was Fantastico!,"Last month, I stayed at the Bernini Bristol for three nights as the tour manager for an American group.  From my perspective, the hotel met our group's expectations very well.  The staff and management were helpful and courteous to me, my colleagues and our entire group.  I want to especially thank Alessandra Zampelli and Emanuela Latini of the Groups & Meetings department for their kind attention and consideration during our stay.  The hotel exudes old world charm and the rooms were very well-appointed with comfortable beds and very fine linens.  As the tour manager, I was able to view many of the rooms of the members and there was consistency on the many floors and some members were thrilled to receive balconies along with the expected 5-star amenities.  The breakfast buffet each day was a superb selection of hot and cold offerings and the dining staff was organized and mannerly.  On our last night at the hotel, we had a group dinner at the L’Olimpo Roof Garden restaurant under the management of Fabio.  The food was excellent, the service wonderful and the view of Rome at sunset is one I and the group will always remember! The hotel has a wonderful location in the centro storico of Rome within easy walking distance to many must-see sights including the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and the Borghese Galleria.  Many thanks to the manager, Mr. Pane and the entire staff at Bernini Bristol for a great stay and end to a wonderful adventure in Italy!",5,2011,08,05
01,25th Wedding Anniversary - Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Bernini Bristol Hotel for 3 nights in August 2011. We had a warm welcome on arrival and on booking we asked for a nice room for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We wasnt dissapointed we were given room 102 over looking the square and free champagne on arrival was iced and in the room. We took advantage of the roof terrace restuarant in the evenings which should not be missed the food was reasonable and the views over Rome breathtaking and very romantic. All of the staff made you feel very welcome, the breakfast ample and the room we had was very clean and the air conditioning most welcome in the 35 degrees heat. I have stayed in many european hotels both on business and personal trips and this is amongst the best",5,2011,08,05
01,An aging doweress,"We stayed at this property as a part of a large group.  When arriving, we were told to leave our bags in a certain location, and, since our rooms were not ready, they would be taken to our assigned room.  When we later arrived back at the hotel, all our bags were in the room--except the bag with my laptop computer in it.
I can understand things like this happening.  What I cannot understand is the management's less than forthcoming answers.  A concierge told me that this was ""not the first time"" this sort of thing had happened.  I wonder why, then they do not improve security, particularly when they asked us to put our bags in a unsecure location.
Further, this is not a 5 star property, according to any standard with which I am acquainted.  The area rugs in the commons area are stained and dirty; the entire building shows of a former glory, that badly needs updating.  The most basic expectations are barely met; we were greeting with cold water showers many times, with the explanation, ""you must let the water run for 5-7 minutes for it to be hot.""  The beds are past their prime.  The commodious commons areas on the room floors are dark, and the furniture in poor condition.  In short, this WAS probably a 5 star property, but if that is your expectation, you would be better suited at another property.
On the plus side, it is conveniently located, and the breakfasts were bountiful, although the wait staff was overwhelmed by the number of persons coming to breakfast, so service was spotty at best.",2,2011,08,01
01,Great location & rooms but a bit run down!,"We are a family of four ( 2 kids ages 14 & 11) and we stayed at the Bernini Bristol for 5 nights before going on a Mediterranean cruise. We had requested 2 rooms with connecting doors and were upgraded to a suite + room. We had an amazing living room in the suite and a great view of the piazza from our windows. The staff at the reception were very friendly and courteous. The concierge, specifically, went out of his way to assist us with finding a marvelous tour guide (Georgia) for our Vatican tour. Our rooms were very luxurious but needed some renovation (carpet, bathrooms). Breakfast was very good and varied. The staff in the breakfast room were very unfriendly, however. We once requested a table for 7 so that we could eat breakfast with our friends, and our waitress absolutely refused to join 2 tables together!! The hotel has a love restaurant on the roof with an amazing view of the city. The disadvantage was that there was no swimming pool, and it wouldn't been nice to have a swim after a hot day walking around in Rome. The hotel's location is excellent. It's a 10 minute walk to Villa Borghese which is a must see park if you have children. It's also about 10 -15 min walk to the Spanish steps, trevi fountain, shopping, etc. You will need taxis to go to the Vatican & Colloseum. ",4,2011,07,30
01,"Great, after a poor start","The Bernini Bristol is an older hotel located right off the Via Veneto and within walking distance to the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese and other popular attractions.  Many, but not all, of the rooms have been beautifully renovated.  When I first arrived, I was given a room that smelled terrible and had wet carpet.  Apparently, the air conditioning unit had leaked.  The front desk was very accomodating - immediately gave me a lovely updated room, with a private terrace.  They could not have been nicer.  
There is a lovely rooftop restaurant and bar, and a fabulous breakfast buffet that is worth the cost.  You can fill up for the whole day.",4,2011,07,28
01,Ugly old hotel and the view not worth it,"Unfortunately this was probably a 5 star hotel long time ago. Today it is not; nor the property nor the hospitality. Instead it appeared rather like a tourist trap. 

Possibly one would argue that the location and the roof terrace are worth the very high price level.
However, you will get similar views and locations at many of the other hotels in this area.

Also the view is not very special, just very nice. For example you don’t see much on the horizon that you can recognize as a famous land mark. Instead you see some nice roof top gardens on the neighbouring houses and with some imagination the top of the Vatican. Further, the roof top restaurant is not very luxury; furniture and decorations are very average. I didn’t stay for dinner.

More important the old and ugly hotel interiors; carpet, lobby sofas, wallpapers from cloth, everything is very old and lost its elegance long time ago. Now it rather looks dusty and possibly dirty. I argue that probably the whole place is dusty, because it’s very difficult to clean all this cloth.

My room was as well a disappointment. It appeared very basic and sparse decorated. The carpet and my bed were clean. However the cloth cornice behind the bed was visibly full of dust. No one must have even tried to brush it of since at least over a year. Probably that gave my the feeling that the room was in general dusty. 

The bathroom was a disappointment too. The floor, toilet, and sink were clean, but both the roof and bathtub seals were covered with dark mold stains. Also the functionality was not very practical. For example the shower waterhose was very cheap and not possible to fixate in a comfortable position. Further the shower cover was too small. Therefore I managed to wet big parts of the bathroom floor.

My bed was a dobuel bed put together into a big bed. Interestingly one on the two beds were broken. The spirals were dead and were clearly hard as well as made a klonk sound when I was moving. Luckely the other side was functioning normal.

The breakfast was my next dissapointment. Just the look of the stainy old carpets, old wallpapers from cloth and old drapery made made me loose the apetite.
Further the food selection reminded me more of a motel style continental breakfast. Certainly there was nothing luxury or 5 star here either. Just plain vanlia motel breakfast.
Also the personell were busy or understaffed. Hence no warm welcoming, seating, or choise of coffe/te. Finally my tee was served by just banging the pot on the table.
As a summary the staff were more busy chainging table cloth than offering 5 star hospitality.

At least the reception staff was very profesionall, fast and hopsitality minded. 

If you really want the roof top view, then stay somewhere else and have dinner at the roof top anyway.",2,2011,07,11
01,A Wonderful Place to Stay,"Our travel agent recommended the Bristal Bernini.  The hotel and it's staff were excellent.  We needed to have our room changed to a handicap room and we were accommodated without any problems.  The hotel is very clean.  Our breakfast was included and the breakfast was very good.  Recommend the Panetone.  Our consigne, Massimiliano helped us before and during our stay.  The location of this hotel was excellent.  The Metro is two seconds away and there are many bus lines that pass nearby.  We were able to walk to the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,06,25
01,"Wonderful location, beautiful room, amazing balcony!","We stayed for 3 days at the Bernini in room 502. Corner room with a beautiful balcony that had comfy chairs to soak in the view of the Piazza Barberini and the Fontana del Tricona. The hotel is next to a Metro stop and within walking distance of many Rome attractions. The hotel is beautifully furnished. The concierge staff were very helpful with directions, restaurant reservations etc. We loved staying at this hotel!",5,2011,06,21
01,"Excellent location, immediately at metro, many restaurants, and plenty of shopping within walking distance.","This hotel is right next to one of the public metro stations,and within walkingdistance to most major sights. We walked every where, including to the coliseum. (We did take metro to vatican). This well located hotel was extremely clean, with fresh sheets changed daily. We had several standard rooms, all adequately sized. Breakfasts were very generous, with many options from fruits, cheeses, meats,eggs,pastries,coffee. Staff during evening were very helpful, while daytime concierge did have a bit of an attitude issue. A disappointment though was that there was no pool for guests, as shown and advertised. Upon arrival we were told the pool was only for the guests in a suite.",4,2011,06,18
01,"Classy hotel, helpful staff, great location!","We stayed at Bernini Bristol for 5 nights.  The staff went out of their way to answer our questions and guide us to our destinations.  Our rooms were good sized and elegantly decorated.  The breakfast buffet was complete and well presented.  The location was great with metro entrance next to hotel; taxis were always available, 1/2 block from Via Veneto,etc.  Of all the hotels and cities we visited in Italy, Bernini Bristol was our #1!.",5,2011,06,13
01,The hotel maybe past it's prime,"Stayed three nights in the hotel suggested and booked by our travel agent.  

The staff was very nice.  The lobby and first floor common areas are  beautiful.  We were disappointed in the rest of the hotel.

The room we had and the one our friends had could use an update.  We needed the staff to adjust the door to the bar cabinet as it was coming off it's hinge.  Even the binder for the hotel information was very worn looking.

The breakfast buffet was less than expected from a four star hotel with a large container of scrambled eggs served cool with out heat each day.  The service was slow and the wait staff needed to be asked to serve coffee.

The location was a 15 minute to the Spanish Steps.  

The staff recommended a over priced restaurant with average food which we were disappointed in.  We ate at much better restaurants in the neighborhood on our own after that.

The internet service was $7 Euros for 3 hours and did not work all three evenings we were there on our computers nor theirs, only during the day for a reason the staff could not explain.",3,2011,05,11
01,Dishonest,"We called to reserve a room at a special rate allowed us by our profession.  We were absolutely clear as to the number of people and nights and type room we wanted and were quoted a price and reserved the room.  We called again the day before arrival to verify the rate and reservation and were given the same information.  However, upon arrival, we were given a rate nearly double what we were quoted.  Being nearly midnight, we were stuck accepting this rate as too late to go anyplace else and after a long day of travel we were exhausted and couldn't begin to look for another hotel.  We felt cheated and trapped.  We were given a ""special"" room that was obviously less than what was offered other guests - probably the same room we would have been given at the lower rate we had been quoted, and that would have been fine, but not at the new rate.  The desk clerk refused to budge on the rate, but offered a free breakfast as compensation.  The breakfast was nice, but the air was so thin in the room that it stifled any enjoyment - and at the 8€ posted price for a single plain croissant, I guess we probably did consume the difference in price in breakfast goods.  At any rate, to sum up:  We felt cheated, that the hotel deliberately misled us and did not honor its agreement and trapped us.  We will never recommend them or stay there again.",1,2011,04,22
01,"Great location, lovely hotel, gracious service",We stayed at the Hotel Bernini for 3 nights and at breakfast every morning enjoyed the beautiful view from their windows and balconies which overlook the city as well as the more than adequate buffet.  The waiters were very attentive as was the front desk staff.  We loved our stay here!,5,2011,04,15
01,"Wow,  blown away","Words can't explain how happy me and my newly wed wife were with this hotel. 

We stayed here for 5 of our 10 nights in Italy for our honeymoon. 

We were upgraded to the suite,  that had a separate living room,  gigantic bathroom... and huge bedroom that overlooked the city of rome. 

A 2 minute walk to the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps.. and across the street from the train station. 

The staff was amazing,  very helpful in our navigation throughout the city. 

Thank you again... we will definitely be returning in the near future!",5,2011,01,26
01,"Location, location","Excellently located not far from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Very comfortable and stylish hotel overlooking the Piazza Barberini. Excellent room overlooking the Piazza. Courtious, attentive, helpful staff. On the tour bus route (stops outside), metro station on the Piazza, great little curbside cafe's and shopping. Definately recommend this hotel.",5,2010,12,31
01,Great!,We were  two couples on a weekend visit to Rome prior to a Cruise from the 29th to the 31st Oct. Our early arrival to the hotel which was running full (there was a Film Festival on) met with a most pleasant welcome from the receptionist who kindly provided a room for the couple with us in their 80`s. Our stay was enjoyable in a superb location close to everything and a helpful staff all thru the hotel. Would definitely return to the Bernini when in Rome which will be next September!,5,2010,11,18
01,excellent,"The hotel staff is exceptionally professional and pleasant,  willing to go above and beyond whatever expectations you might have... 
It is indeed a true joy to stay at the Bernini while in Rome and an unforgettable experience for anyone wishing to explore the ""eternal city"" and feel right at home..",5,2010,11,11
01,Nice Hotel dont ask questions,"Had two differnet rooms. Do Not get in the front of hotel. Very loud. Rooms are fine with an old charm. Clean. Housekeeping is wonderful at working around you. Breakfast is very nice. Internet is a bit confusing but you can purchase in room. Only one computer for consumer use. Rooms are not done until close to check in time. Desk staff is nice but conceirge can make you feel a bit stupid for asking questions, Good locations within walking disstance to most anything. Cabs are reasonable.Undergrounds right outside the door. No pool.",3,2010,10,25
01,Definitely not a 5 star,"I visited this hotel at the end of September this year.
We had a deal including ""GUARANTEED upgrade"" ,welcome gift and buffet breakfast.
Arriving at the hotel I was surprised that the receptionist-her name is Yanna- did not found right to rise her eyes from the computer (nobody else was there)and asked me on a very disturbed tone:""checking in?"". No ""welcome"" and no ""hello"".
Very soon she started with the check in procedure and was very unpleased with the way my husband filled up the form (missed the right line everything being very unclear). She threw the file to the garbage and said like a teacher to a lazy pupil ""now you have to fill an other one from the beginning""-no try to help in any way.
When I reminded her that we have a guaranteed upgrade she started to talk on a very un-appropriate tone with me and my husband. The essence of what she was saying is that we don't have a GUARANTEED upgrade and she is not going to give us a junior suite (which was next category). She did everything in order to make us give-up,continuing to say that we do not understand what is written on the reservation and that the upgrade is upon availability and that they are fully booked so they can't give us the junior suite.
After the fact that we said we will contact immediately ""SummitHotels""(they are part of this chain) and asked her for the manager ,she refused to call the manager saying that she will contact him by herself. She disappeared for 30 minutes from the reception and on her return she said with the tone as she makes us a great favor that she will give us the junior suite  (*interesting they were not fully-booked anymore).
And now about the hotel: very centrally located ,close to Spanish Steps and at the beginning of Via Veneto ,the Metro station is in front of the hotel.
But ,the building is very old and needs renovation ,the furnitures are old ,faded,bathrooms with old installation including rust and yellow -brown spots in toilette.
If you have a room on the 7-th floor -as we did-you are dead! The restaurant-terrace is on the 8-th floor right above your head and they remove the tables a few time per day including middle of the night-after they close the restaurant.
So forget about sleeping ,the noise is so strong that even TV we couldn't hear!
Breakfast is average ,at 5 star hotel I expected freshly prepared eggs -not re-heated as they serve.
Also the sweets are really bad . 
No newspapers ,they make copies on a copy-machine of the principal news ,pathetic!
The hall of the hotel is also very badly furnished,not like a Grand Hotel.
This hotel is a 3 star hotel ,try to avoid if you can.",2,2010,10,19
01,Expensive but worth it,"This is an expensive hotel, and we had to save up for it on our first trip to Rome.  A room cost us more than double what we would normally pay, and we don't often use budget hotels.  But we both agreed it was well worth the extra expense.

It is very conveniently situated, close to the historic city and not far from the main rail station (Termini).  There is a Metro stop a few paces away from the hotel entrance, and the piazza over which the hotel presides is a major taxi hub.  All the major guided-tour buses stop in the piazza.  There are loads of trattoria, restaurants and bars to suit all tastes, and good quality shops nearby.  It's a five minute walk to the Spanish Steps, and about fifteen minutes walk to the river Tiber (Tevere).

The hotel itself is rather grand in a slightly self-conscious and over-dressed way, with damask wall-hangings, heavy curtains and matching furniture.  Our room faced the piazza so we had a good view over the square and its slightly grotesque Triton fountain.  The room was soundproof and very quiet.  It was also big, with a fine high ceiling.  It felt comfortable and not at all claustrophobic like some hotel rooms.  A rather off-putting point - the carpet was really dirty, it had been vacuumed but it was grubby-looking, and there was an indelible wine-stain in a conspicuous place.  The bed was large and comfortable, linen good quality.

The bathroom was a disappointment, an over-bath power-shower but an inadequate shower screen.  A marble surround for the sink offered plenty of room for make-up to be stored.  The push-button flush on the toilet came away from the wall when pressed.  The bathroom door didn't lock - not essential, but could be inconvenient to some.

In-room facilities included a minibar, a safe, and a TV with CNN, BBC News 24 and some SKY movies.  No coffee-making facilities.  We were given a complimentary bottle of red wine on the evening we arrived.  Room service is good, but very, very expensive - not for the faint-hearted.   We had a meal in the Olympus restaurant on the roof, and the service was very good, the food well-cooked, well-presented and tasty, but (again) very expensive.   A bottle of local red wine cost Euro 50.  But the total experience was worth paying for, as was the view from the roof terrace over the rooftops to the floodlit dome of St Peter's.

The hotel was very relaxed and service was unobtrusive, warmly cordial, and promptly delivered.  Everything about the hotel was congruent with our overall experience of Rome: welcoming, hospitable, unpretentious and utterly civilised in the best Roman sense of the word.  We even forgive them the dirty carpet.",4,2010,10,16
01,"Tired rooms, ready for an overhaul.","Recently stayed in this hotel.  Fantastic location though is looking a little tired.  The lobby and rooftop terrace were fabulous but we stayed on the 2nd floor and it certainly was not what we expected.  Spotlights were hanging out of the bathroom, the shower leaked and the hairdryer was pathetic.  Furniture dated and scruffy. A little small, which one would expect from city hotels, but certainly ready for a refurb.  Would recommend though for location and rooftop views.",3,2010,10,13
01,Eh...nice...quite nice.,"Located within a walk to the Spanish Steps, this hotel offers sweet reception service, a nice lobby bar, (where we waited the ""just 15 minutes""--aka 2 hrs--for our room to be readied for our morning arrival,) and a beautiful rooftop restaurant with spectacular city views. But...our room was perfectly situated above the piazza, (Grazie, Sr Mgr!) but the carpet and upholstery were filthy, and no one had lifted the chair cushions to clean for quite a time...the twin beds were separate but we slept together in one, which wad surprisingly comfortable. All in all, we might choose to stay at the Inn at the Spanish Steps as we have previously for a few more euros... The Bristol was satisfactory and I have few complaints, but we didn't love it.",4,2010,09,29
01,"Great hotel, but maybe not for the business traveler","I was in Rome for business, and stayed at the Bernini Bristol as it was very close to my event location.  Given that the reviews were good and the website looked very nice, I decided to give it a go.   When I arrived (albeit very early), the room wasn't available, which was perfectly understandable.  However, I was told to check back in an hour, that it would likely be ready, but after 2 hours it still wasn't so I decided to do more sightseeing and come back later.   When I did come back, though, they had brought my luggage up with a bottle of wine, which was very nice. 

The room was very nice, and the toiletries were of really good quality.   However, the most disappointing thing was actually the service I received.   Outside of the wonderful bottle of wine, everything else was not very helpful.    They do not exchange currency, which I find a bit odd for an international 5-star hotel, and as law in Italy, do not have irons in the room.    While that is fine, when I called to ask, I was told that there was nothing they could do for me because the laundry service was over for that day and that I should find an outside laundry facility.  When I explained that I couldn't get into my room until 4pm and my event was at 6pm and I needed to iron my clothes, I was told that that's the way it was, and if it was urgent they could ""try"" to get something done in that amount of time by an outside vendor.  Given that I needed my suit, I just decided to try to steam it in the bathroom.    I understand that laws are laws, but I can't believe I'm the only one who needs something ironed and is only staying for one night (thereby not able to use their laundry service).   At another hotel in Milan, they had a similar law but housekeeping would iron items for guests.     Also, they don't have a business center.  

So in sum, great hotel, great location - but for a business traveler you might want to pick a place that is better suited for non-vacationers needs.  

 Although not a necessity at a hotel, they do not exchange currency, which was a bit inconvenient.",4,2010,09,29
01,End of dream of vacation,"We arrived quite easily at the Bernini Bristol via metro.  The hotel itself was our least favorite of the vacation, but the hotel itself was fine and it did fit in with the city of Rome, which again was not our favorite city (we had visited Cinque Terre, Florence, Venice and then Rome).  The hotel was comfortable with a beautiful balcony overlooking Palazo Bernine (I believe that is  what it was called) and we had a fun time watching the CRAZY drivers.  I have to just say that driving in Italy is absolutely crazy.  Lines in the roads are not rule but suggestions.  We had counted and there would be 7 cars and motorcyles across in a 3 lane road.  

Anyways, moving past that, we did enjoy the hotel.  The breakfast was included and we also had a great 3 coursee dinner that was included.  The bill at the end was crazy high, but since it was included it was removed from the bill.  The bathroom was quite big and the shower was roomy.  The hotel itself was centrally located and in a safe location.  While we were there we ate a restaruant called Tuna which was very good.",4,2010,09,28

01,Extremely Enjoyable Stay,"My wife and I just had an unusually good experience in staying at the Hotel Bernini Bristol in Rome.  The hotel has an excellent location just a few blocks from the Spanish Steps, and it is next to a bank with ATM and a subway stop.  It has a a tremendous view from the rooftop restaurant and lounge (where we had drinks) with St. Peter's Basilica visible, among other sights.  The room was very comfortable and had all we wanted, including safe and good AC.  Most impressive, the service was outstanding.  The two concierges Max and Umberto were extremely knowledgeable and resourceful, in suggesting how we spend our limited time in Rome, to helping us obtain reservations on short notice to difficult-to-obtain attractions, and to recommending outstanding and memorable restaurants off the beated path, and only a few blocks away.  we could not have been happier with this gem of an experience.  In addition, the staff was extremely helpful when we arrived early morning, and gave us a very nice room before regular check-in time.  We feel very fortunate that a friend recommended this hotel, and recommend it to anyone.",5,2010,07,05
01,Excellent,"The Hotel Bernini-Bristol is located in of the best areas of Rome, within easy reach of all monuments and attractions.

01,Beyond amazing,"I decided to turn a stopover into an overnight stay and priced the airport Hilton.  Their rate was so out of sinc with their rooms that I decided to stay in Rome.  For the same price I was able to book a luxury hotel that a family member had enjoyed in the past.  The Bristol Bernini has a great location, minutes from the Spanish Steps.  The staff is welcoming and heard it was my birthday and offerred me an amazing upgrade.  I am glad that I took pictures because the entire experience feels like a dream.  Mr Fernando Pane, the front office manager, and his staff were gracious professionals who offerred the highest level of service from beginning to end.  I can't wait to go back!",5,2010,07,03
01,"Excellent Hotel,Great location,Great Staff",I had an excellent experience in my stay at The Bernini. The location is great. The staff was very helpful and professional.

First thing I noticed a spot of poo in the toilet.. 5 minutes later 2 housekeeping ladies knock and ask if it was all ok...I said, no the bathrooms is dirty, nobody ever came back to clean it... the room was non smoking and you could smell smoke all over. The remote control was oily. The room service is outrageously expensive. The breakfast was ok, but again too expensive. Staff in the reception and bar was rude, unpolite, non professional. I requested a wake up call that I never got. Internet should be free or of easy access, not at all! Too bad in such a great spot of Rome the hotel is such a dissapointment...",3,2010,06,22
01,Great Hotel in Central Location,"We stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol as part of a Luxury Link package.  The deal included a 3 night stay with breakfast and one dinner at the hotel's rooftop restaurant.  We were extremely satisfied with our stay.  The hotel staff was extremely attentive and polite throughout our visit.  The hotel is centrally located near the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and other attractions.  Our room was clean and well-appointed with comfortable beds.  The rooftop restaurant has one of the most beautiful views of Rome and was one of the highlights of our trip.  The food and service were exceptional.  Since the dinner was included as part of our package, we were able to enjoy a 5 star dining experience with no bill.  The meal was tremendous, but would have been very expensive without the package deal.  We will definitely return to the Bernini Bristol the next time we visit Rome.",5,2010,06,17
01,Kush Hotel.,"Hands down, the fanciest hotel I stayed in while in Europe. It's located in a cute piazza (Piazza Barberini) which is in the designer/nice part of Rome.

01,Good stay but could be better,"Good 3 night stay. Would consider again if I could get a good rate for another trip but not convinced.

Positives are:
Fab, central location
Welcoming, friendly staff
Very elegant and comfortable room on 2nd floor with spacious terrace (shame outside light didn't work)
Gorgeous roof terrace with magnificent views (seemed v under-utilised during our stay  - staff seemed genuinely surprised and a bit confused when I sought out a bottle of wine at 5ish after a day's touring. It was a lovely end to the day but could have been better. They put cushions on the iron chairs as they were setting up for dinner later but what about our bots on the wrought iron chairs as we supped a E45 bottle of wine?

Negatives
Weird, gloomy bar in reception with plentiful bar snacks but no wiping of tables from previous guests until asked
Toiletries were a bit odd. Kicked myself for not bringing shampoo as none was available and used bathfoam instead (was ok), then next day got shampoo (I know, should have asked, but when you're in the shower...)
Continental breakfast was fine/good but the cooked breakfast was below par, particularly the eggs.",3,2010,05,19
01,Loved Bernini Bristol - definitely going back!,"We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. We had a top room, overlooking Triton Fountain, and had a balcony with an awesome view. Room was comfortable, clean, well decorated, and quiet. I am a light sleeper and was nervous the outside traffic would keep me up, but I was more than fine!  The concierge was amazing, and constantly led us in the best direction. The marble bathroom had a huge tub, great shower with strong water pressure, and was a very very large bathroom. The location was PERFECT - walking distance to everything.  If we go back to Rome, we're only staying at the Hotel Bernini Bristol!",5,2010,04,29
01,"Great staff, fading glamour","Just returned from a trip to Rome and we stayed at the Bernini Bristol for four nights. First off, I want to say that the location and the staff are second to none. One of the most conveniently located hotels in Rome with a staff who are attentive, caring and knowledgable.

The hotel itself, however, is a bit of a faded rose.  The rooms were at best shabby (and we were in a junior suite) and oddly configured. It looked like a railroad apartment with flocked wallpaper. The bed had one of the most uncomfortable mattresses known to man and was oddly low to the floor as was the other furnishings.The couch and chairs were old and should have been replaced at least five to ten years ago. 

The roof top restaurant was a nice touch with a great vierw and again a wonderful staff. We ate their twice and the food was inconsistent. First meal fairly good. Dinner - tasted like shoe leather. The prices were not a bargain and unfortunately for the great wait staff, the restaurant was basically empty the entire time we were there.

The whole hotel had a run-down, feeling. The breakfast room was certainly pleasant, however the prepared food was abominable. Every morning the food was at best luke warm or, as was the case every day with the bacon and sausages, burnt beyond recognition. 

Again the staff and the location are definitley 5 stars - Sina should invest some cash in this property to make it match the staff.",2,2010,04,14
01,"I would stay here again, and again.","I loved this quaint old hotel.  It has so much historical value in itself to enjoy.  The staff was amazingly gracious and kind.  They were always smiling and pleasant in every way.  The hotel breakfast was really enjoyable with a lovely view of Rome.  Fresh fruit, great coffee, and just about every option available for every taste.   The location is perfect and in the center of everything.  Our room was small, but most European rooms are so we were not surprised.  Our view was just about as perfect as a view can be of  the fountain and all of Rome.  The bathrooms are up to date with marble and powerful showers.",5,2010,04,02
01,I am a very happy returning customer,"I have chosen this hotel for the third time in a row for my trips in Rome. The quality of the service is outstanding. The courtesy of the staff is incomparable. Breakfast and restaurant on roof top are of high quality. 
Other reviews all agree about the wonderful location, and I am extremely surprised at the occasional bad experience of some visitors. I have received consistently a great service under every respect and I will choose the Bernini Bristol for my next trip in Rome. I highly recommend it.",5,2010,01,03
01,Perfect Location,"We loved the location!  Super convenient and in a very nice area.  Our room was very large and clean.  We dined in the restaurant one night and enjoyed an amazing dinner with fabulous staff.  The views from the top were equally impressive.  It was pricey... we did have nicer rooms (more lavishly decorated, but not larger) in Florence and in Venice, but the location could not have been any better.   The elevators were very small and slow, but added to the charm of a 100+ year old hotel.  Overall we loved it!",4,2009,12,12
01,"Great location but overpriced and not 5 star, service variable","We stayed for four nights with our 10 month old baby following a business trip. For convenience we stayed on here following a business conference and against our better judgement. We tend to find the poorer reviews on Trip Advisor are fairly accurate (with the odd exception) and we have a general dislike of large corporate hotels but as we had the baby with us for the latter half of the trip, we decided to stay on.  I'm sure once the hotel was marvellous and grand (probably about 50 years ago), our room was very large but faded and in need of basic maintenance (skirting board falling off, noisy water, faulty phone).  Had we been paying 150 Euros a night we would have been pleased with the size of the room and the baby cot but at 270 Euros it felt overpriced.  Toiletries were very ordinary and we had no robes even though colleagues did have. The service is very variable - when we enquired about a high chair at breakfast you would have thought we had landed from Mars - eventually a dingy looking seat arrived. On the other hand, the service at the bar downstairs was good and friendly and afternoon tea surprisingly good value (well compared to a staggering 36 Euros for breakfast!).  So a very mixed experience, however given the exchange rate it may well be that this is what you can expect for this price at the moment!",3,2009,10,19
01,Rome - so much history - so exciting!,"We stayed in the Bernini Bristol Hotel overlooking the Piazza Barberino. It was sensational. Our room overlooked the street and the famous fountain in the Piazza. We had 3 nights in this hotel and every day was a huge adventure. Staff were great, breakfasts were wonderful and staff were so profesional and so Italian. We absolutely loved this hotel and also its location which had us in walking distance of Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and just a great area to be.",5,2009,08,05
01,Stay Away,"This is not a five star hotel. It's tired. They did upgrade me to a junior suite which was basically a larger room but the air conditioning was very poor. I had it on full blast and it still was 26C in the room (80F). They came up and turned the dial a bit which did nothing and In the middle of the night  I went down to the front desk to complain and they were not able to do anything but they did move me to another room the next day which was marginally better.
Furniture in the rooms are tired and bed was too hard. Breakfast was not included which it is in most hotels in Italy and was very expensive.
It was a good location - close to the Spanish Steps and shopping on Via del Corso but there other good hotels within a five minute walk which i would stay at next time.",2,2009,07,07
01,Lovely hotel in a lovely location,"I don't understand the mixed reviews on this site, it seems as though people were staying in different hotels.  We stayed with a tour group with Adventures by Disney, and we found our room clean and comfortable.  There were three of us and they had a section of the room portioned to fit a twin rollaway for our daughter.  The room was small, but I think normal for European standards, and comfortable for us, though we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, you're in Rome!  Wonderful location next to the metro station, a nice walk up Via Veneto to the Borghese Gardens, and a short stroll to Trevi Fountain.  Breakfast was included in our plan, and they had eggs, omlettes, meats, cheeses, fruits, pastries, and the best green apple juice.  Waitstaff were always ready to serve me cappucino.  When I needed a safety pin, the front desk supplied me with a sewing kit.  The rooftop restaurant offered a beautiful view and they allowed us up just to admire the city.  It seemed pricey, but I regret that we didn't enjoy dinner there one evening.",5,2009,06,17
01,Beautiful hotel in great location,We were pleasantly surprised with the Hotel Bernini after reading most of the bad reviews.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and is in an excellant location close in walking distance to the Spanish Steps and Via Del Corso.  Our room and bathroom were very spacious according to European standards and were very clean. Our decor was an older Italian neoclassic style while our travel partners room was newly remodeled and contemporary.  On the rooftop is a lounge and restaurant with a gorgeous view of the entire City of Rome.  Staff was extremely helpful.  This was our 8th trip to Rome and will definitely stay here again on our next visit.,5,2009,05,31
01,Left to the winds..,"The Bernini Bristol is a historic hotel in Rome, in a perfect location.
Unfortunately it has been left to the winds. The staff had all the signs of being neither trained nor managed. 
The reception staff/ front desk was approximate. When we arrived they helped me out of the car ,when we left I carried my own bags out in the car. Parking was charged at almost EUR 50 a day.
I needed a telephonenumber in Oslo. In an empty reception nobody could help me. Buy  1 hour on the internet, and the only computer is busy, so you have a problem Madam.
In the dining room the waiters were bored and rude. I had to ask the waiter not to put his fingers where I put my mouth when bringing me the cappucino! In a 5 star Lux hotel!!!
The pillows in the bed killed our necks, a rude russian maid told me it was the only kind provided. Poor bathroom, very little light and poor toiletries. If we were unfortunate and were unable to open the hotel safe with our property inside, an EUR 105 fine would be charged! The room was clean, but badly in need of refurbishment. Gowns and slippers were provided.",2,2009,05,01
01,Good Bernini Experience,"I booked Hotel Bernini months in advance, for 2 nights in August of 2008.  It had been recommended to me by a friend who lives in Rome.  I did get a little nervous about my decision to stay here after reading all the trip advisor reviews, as so many reviews seemed to be so negative. Still, I trusted Roberto (my Italian friend) who had said the hotel was good, the location was great, etc.  

Thank heavens I believed my friend, because we had a wonderful experience, a great two nights in Bernini.  The location is indeed central to just about everything in Roma (with the Metro just steps from the front door).  The staff were welcoming and accomodating, and helped us arrange (hard to find) 6 person van cabs for excursions.  Our room was spacious enough for Roma, and immaculate.  I never ran into mold or mildew...everything was fresh and clean (rooms, hallways, lobby etc).  The view from the rooftop terrace is wonderful!  We did not eat at the hotel, breakfast or anything else, so I can't comment on that.  We did grab paninis from a great little cafe just kitty-corner to the hotel, very inexpensive (including aqua) every day!

I'm very glad we chose to stay at this hotel for our nights in Roma, the hotel met all our needs.",4,2008,09,12
01,Good location but disastreous hotel!!,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 3 days in July 2007.
The Hotel is extremely well located but the services, rooms and food are disastreous.
This is maximum a 3 stars hotel!! not at all a 5 stars....
the breakfest is discusting..and the staff is impolite... would not recomend this hotel at all!!!",1,2008,08,07
01,Watch out for the Breakfast con,"In May 2008 2 adults and a 13 yr old stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol for 3 nights.

We had booked our room without breakfast.  On the first night in Rome we had a bad experience in a local restaurant - they served us raw chicken but that is another story!  On the following morning we decided to treat ourselves to breakfast in the hotel as we hadn't had much to eat the night before and we were planning a full day of sight seeing.  On entering the breakfast room we told the lady serving that we would be paying for our breakfast.  We gave her our name and room number and looking at the list she informed us that the hotel had included breakfast.  We double checked this with her and then went and had breakfast.  We then went down for breakfast on the following two mornings.  At no time were we asked to sign for the food we had eaten.  

On the morning of checkout I examined the bill and found that they had included 9 breakfasts.  The amount was approximately £250!  When I queried this I was told that breakfast was not included and it didn't matter what the serving staff in their restaurant had told me.  The woman on reception was the rudest person I have ever had to deal with - speaking in Italian to her colleague and shouting at me.  I have to say the reception staff are not the friendliest even when you are not complaining!!

As we were due to leave for the airport I paid the bill and on our return to the UK I wrote to the head office.  I received a reply that was full of nothing but sickly sweet platitudes.  I wrote again on the 20th June but they have not seen fit to reply this time as compensation was mentioned.  

I realise that I shouldn't have paid originally. I also realise that I am not going to get anything back from the Sina Hotel chain but I wanted to warn others in case this is a way of them conning people out of their money and they pull this scam on a regular basis.",3,2008,08,06
01,"Way Over Priced, Rooms Small, Front Desk Rude","Rome was the last stop of our 13 day trip to Italy. We arrived early to the hotel so we could explore the city on our last day. The front desk was very busy and confusing. To park our van they wanted 90 euro... and our car 40, we were traveling with friends who had stayed here before on a business type trip.  the bellman advised us to park on a pay lot two blocks away 25 euro. They took our bags and said they would have them in our rooms when we returned. When we returned no bags. They took my husband and I to a small room 1st  floor right next to the bus stop when I went down the hall to see my friends room they each had a suite. I asked them if they had upgraded or paid more than the 365 euro we had they said no that it was the same. So off I went down stairs to the front desk, and asked why was my room so much different for the same price, this took some talking in the back room with somone maybe the manager, came back and said  they had just upgraded the other two couples and not us becouse we were on the same reservation. That  souned crazy to me and I explained that we were all traveling together and it did not seem right to not upgrade everyone at the same time. She gave me a too bad for you look and that was that. I am happy for my friends to have the nicer room but the room we stayed in which was later explained to me was also and  an upgrade of sorts,was small  next to the lift and the noise from the bus stop kept us up all night long, We were exausted for our trip back to the states.
The only thing we really thought was great about this place was the restaurant on the roof . We had dinner there  that night and the view was beautiful, service was good ( not  over the top on personality) food great!!!! Watching the sun set and the moon rise was worth the huge bill that came at the end of the meal.(This too was way overpriced, but in this case worth it)
MY ADVISE STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND BOOK YOU DINNER AT THE ROOF TOP RESTAURANT.",2,2008,06,24
01,Almost.....,"This hotel is really good. Great location, beautifully decorated rooms. It's even reasonable value for what it is, being € 50 cheaper than the Boscolo just up the road (see review), but far, far better. Although we didn't eat dinner in the restaurant, the breakfast is excellent, with fresh fried eggs on the buffet, rather than just the usual overcooked scrambled. Helpful concierge, too.

So why not a full five stars ?  Well, the official rating is 5*L, which should mean something really exceptional, and good as this is it's not quite there.  One of our group couldn't get fully hot water in his room, and my heating was a bit iffy. The receptionist was a bit short when I asked if I could get miles on my frequent flyer card (only if you book through a particular network apparently). Finally, although I didn't have any black mould in my room as referred to in another review, the bathroom was a bit tired and could have done with a lick of paint and some polish on the floor. Small niggles, but they just take the edge off the experience.

In summary I wouldn't hesitiate to book again as it's a great all round package, but if you are after top flight luxury (and are prepared to pay) go to the St Regis or the Eden instead.",4,2008,01,21
01,"A little stuffy for us, but beautiful and great location.","My husband and I got an amazing deal at a room in the Bernini Bristol, but it is definitely a hotel for rich tourists. This is not the place to stay if you are hoping to have a very authentic Roman experience, although I don't really know where you would stay for that. The hotel is located right next to the subway station which was ideal for us. At the same time, the hotel is located in the heart of tourist land with restaurants catering to these guests. Some may seek this, but we were hoping for something a bit more authentically Italian. 

Regardless, the rooms were beautiful and clean. The staff were eager to please. Any issues we had with the hotel were due more to our personal taste than any real problem. You will be pleased with your stay at the Bernini Bristol.",5,2007,12,01
01,No way is this a 5* hotel,"I would not recommended this hotel to anyone. It is definitely not worthy of a 5 * rating. I found the service highly lacking and the accomodation sub-standard. On arrival at reception we were ignored for quite a while. The receptionists sat in a room where they could clearly see us but they probably couldn't imagine why we were standing there so didn't budge.  The concierge was completely useless and gave us inaccurate information.   I travelled with 4 other ladies so we had two rooms. One of the rooms was a Double Deluxe!!! which had dirty, stained carpets and a layer of dust everywhere. The TV was an unbeleivable 14"" antique.  A cot that was sqeezed into the room was clearly a child's bed and quite uncomfortable for an adult.  When we complained to the manager about the room he said he was familiar with Room 610 and tried to convince us that this room was acceptable.  This is not the way for customers to be treated in a 5 star hotel. 
The rooftop restaurant was apparently worth visiting, but the prices were indeed extortionate so we thought we'd go to the bar at least to have a drink and enjoy the view.  But, as we approached the restaurant we were told the bar was closed.... though we observed live music being played and the restaurant and bar were completely unoccupied at 9:00pm on a Friday night!
The concierge was unable to book us a taxi in advance, and on the day of our departure I asked the receptionist to make a brief call to re-confirm our transport from the hotel to the airport but was told to return to my room to make the call. I will go nowhere near this hotel again and will advise anyone I know travelling to Rome to avoid this hotel as well!",1,2007,11,27
01,Black Mold!,"If this a 5 star hotel then so is my local Motel 6. The rooms we stayed in were completely worn out and not too clean. The design of the shower door allowed water to run out onto the floor of the bathroom and carpet of the room. BLACK MOLD has been growing there for quite some time. I have posted a photo I took of the mold. The staff is condescending nearly to the point of being rude. I do not recommend this Hotel to anyone.
",1,2007,09,03
01,Great location and service,"My 21-year-old son and I spent a week at the Bernini Bristol, and the hotel really made our stay in Rome an enjoyable experience. 
The room was exactly as pictured on the hotel's website, elegant damask drapes and wall covering,  spacious and very clean.  We had a 4th floor room facing a side street, so the view wasn't anything extraordinary, but we didn't hear any street noise at all from the busy Piazza Barberini.  The air-conditioning worked great, making the hotel an oasis of coolness after a day of walking around in the 100 degree heat.  Our rate, which was about $320 US a night (moderate, by Rome standards) didn't include breakfast, so I can't tell you about that, but the hotel does have a lovely (and very expensive) restaurant.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  I spoke to several of the concierge staff before our trip, and they helped me get opera tickets in advance.  I never felt that they were holding out their hands for a tip, either.  The best thing about the Bernini, though, is the location.  Piazza Barberini is so centrally located that you can really walk almost anywhere.  We only took a cab once during the whole week.  The Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Termini Station and the Pantheon are all within a 10-15 minute walk. The Forum and the Colloseum are only a little farther.  The Vatican looked like it was too far, but we actually walked back after a tour by bus, and it wasn't a bad walk at all.  There's also a metro station in the Piazza right outside the hotel, and a currency exchange and an ATM machine right next door, which is very convenient.  There are literally dozens of restaurants and trattoria within a few minutes of the hotel on the Via Tritone or the Via Veneto, so whether you're looking for coffee and a croissant, a slice of pizza or a really nice dinner, you don't have to go far.  The only negative thing I have to say is not about the hotel itself, but about the tour company that the concierge booked with when we asked for a Vatican tour and a day trip to Pompeii.  We weren't crazy about it, so I'd recommend you do some research and either book for yourself online, or come with phone numbers and ask the concierge to call the company of your choice.  We were much more pleased with the tours that we arranged on our own.

01,"Fine, but mediocre hotel and service","Hotel Bernini Bristol is on Piazza Barberini.  The location is OK (for instance, very very convenient to the Barberini Metro station - outside the hotel door pretty much), but not great if you want less touristy dining and cafe options.  We stayed at this hotel for our last two nights in Rome (earlier in the week we stayed at the lovely Hotel Teatro di Pompeo, then went to Positano for a few days, then back to Rome).  This hotel claims it is 5 star.  It isn't.  I think Expedia (who we booked it through) rates it as 4 star.  That is maybe even pushing it a little.  Read on...

First, note that our experience was completely pleasant and nothing bad happened.  The room was clean, fairly large, and comfortable.  But the service was generally lacking (even for Italy!).  After realizing we booked through Expedia we seemed to get even more indifference from the reception staff!  Concierge was not particularly helpful (certainly not enthusiastic about helping/offering advice).  View from room was good (out on to Piazza Barberini).

This hotel has a rooftop bar/restaurant, which was one incentive to stay there.  Having drinks on the rooftop with a great view at sunset was the plan.  However, their prices are extortionate.  Even for a hotel (where you expect some kind of premium pricing).  I hate it when hotels take their ""right"" to over-charge too far, and this hotel did that in bucketloads.  It is a pity.

Overall, not a terrible hotel.  I wouldn't stay there again just because there are better options and better locations in Rome.  In terms of location, note that this hotel is very convenient to the Metro/subway and within easy walking distance of the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese, and the Trevi Fountain.  If you are more interested in hanging out in cool cafes/bars and eating in less touristy, more authentic Roman restaurants then stay elsewhere.  The area closer to Piazza Navona and Campo dei Fiori is probably better then.
",3,2007,07,25
01,Wonderfully located well appointed bernini,"Fabulously located hotel - 7 minutes from Spanish Steps, 10 min from Trevi fountain, 15 minutes from pantheon, 30 minute stroll of colloseo.  Very luxuriant and well appointed hotel.  Decor is a very baroque and you expect Louis XVI to jump out at any point!!  Comes with bathrobes, marble bathrooms, well equipped gym and the spa area looks nice (jacuzzi wasn't working during our 5 night stay).  

The food is extortionate here, however and there are lots of great restaurants half the price within walking distance.  

ask for a room on the quiet side (i.e. not on the side facing the piazza, as the traffic is loud there, rooms are right next to the lift and smaller than on the side).  

Rome tips:  when going to the colliseum - go with the tour groups that one can find there - you miss the queue, get the highlights and then can book a tour to the vatican - which also misses the queues - the standard of the tours are very good.  Call in advance (or get reception) to book tickets for the Galleria Borghese - in my opinion better than the Capitoline museum.  Fabulous art and sculptures.  Food - Gusto and a roof top restuarant by the Spanish Steps were both wonderful.  Once again, book in advance as both are popular!

01,"A first rate, luxurious experience!","My husband and I stayed for a weekend at the Bernini Bristol and it was a joy from beginning to end.  Fabulous location (five minutes walk from the Trevi Fountain, 15 from the colloseum) and sumptous decor within.  The staff could not do enough for us.  Our room had a great view and was large and comfortable.  The breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  It made our stay in this great city magical.

01,Great Hotel beautiful views,"We did a Mediterranean cruise out of Rome and stayed at the Bernini  Bristol for a couple of nights before the cruise.  From our suite we had a lovely view of Rome. Our rooms were very clean and the staff very friendly.  The location is excellent.  We will certainly stay there on our next trip to Rome/
",5,2006,11,14
01,5-star price with 3-star service,"If 5-star means indifferent staff, then this is 5-star.  The service highlight were the doormen.  If they were all like them, we would have some service.  I felt like the front desk staff was a bit snooty.

The hotel is old and ornate, but seems to need some renovaion around the edges.  It was also clean.  So, I would say it was nice enough.  But, it would never hit my list of favorites.  And for the price, I am unlikely to return.
",3,2006,11,06
01,Very Happy with this hotel,"Even though we only stayed one night, we were so happy with this hotel.  Our room was so comfortable and the staff were so nice.  The location was great - we were able to walk everywhere.  I am so happy that we stayed here even after reading previous reviews.  We were even able to get into our room by 10:30 AM which after flying all night was a big benefit.

I would stay here again in a minute.
",5,2006,09,26
01,Great Hotel! 5-star,"We had already booked Bernini Bristol prior to reading the Trip Advisor reviews for it which were quite negative.  As a result, we had fairly low expectations.  We were so pleasantly surprised to see that it was a gorgeous hotel.  The staff were very professional and our room was huge and very nice - looking out towards a fountain.

The only negative comments I have are, 1. the hotel room service is extremely expensive so we ducked across the road to Pepy's Snack Bar for takeaway (too tired to eat out after big day seeing the sights of Rome) and 2. we both had massages which were quite expensive but did not go for the full hour.

Other than that - great hotel.

01,"Great Location, Rooms Vary, Ask to see room first.. but great stay!!","My wife and I just got back from a 5 night stay at the Bernini Bristol and it is a good property in a great location but just do a few things to make sure you have the same wonderful stay we had.

First.. I have been selling high end international travel for the past 12 years and have learned few things along the way.

Hotel rooms in Europe greatly vary in size and decor.  You should always leave your bags in the lobby and ask the bellman to show you the room first.  He is working for your tip and wants to make you happy to get the bigger tip.. if you give him the tip and he leaves and then you want to change your room.. You are now a pain in the rear.  If I like the room great.. if I dont I go down to the front desk and ask for a better room, and do so until I get a room that is acceptable.   Most reputable hotels will do this or not charge you to move to another hotel.. If I have a real problem I walk down the street and try to find a similar hotel and ask to see a room there .. sometimes that works out great and I get an amazing room in a differnt hotel for the same or less.

The original room I was shown was room 701 which was on the newly renovated ( I think they are done with most of the rooms and hallways) but the room was small and I could reach out my door and touch the elevator door which was 1 foot away.  I was not about to hear the elevator ding all night long so I made them change me to room 525 which was great and probably double the size of the first room.

I will upload the layout of the hotel from their hallway ""fire escape"" plan so that you can see the floor plan of hotel.. good to see what are the larger rooms.  If you have trouble or need help just email me --- and my advice is always free. I just hope you have some great vacations!

",4,2006,08,30
01,Disappointing for the price,"We stayed only for one night, so this is a snapshot. 
The reception area is somewhat shabby with scuffed coffee tables, dated Italianate furnishings and dingy lighting. We seemed to be invisible to the Russian receptionist for about 5 minutes whilst she discussed something with a colleague. The rooms were a reasonable size and the beds very comfortable. Noise in our low floor front-facing room was minimal with the windows shut and a/c on. We had dinner at the rooftop L'Olimpo restaurant, the service is very good and the view is what you go there for but it's extremely expensive and the food style is somewhat dated. We had dressed for a special occasion and were surprised to see Americans allowed in in jeans, trainers and short-sleeved shirts. Breakfast was bad and in no way 5 star. Tinned pears, foul coffee, cold fried eggs and bacon that could take your eye out if you attempted to stab it. There was a forlorn lady hoovering in the hallway who was clearly visible and audible throughout this sad meal. If it hadnt been included in the price I would have argued the cost. Yes this is a centrally located hotel, but it is overpriced and several areas need a refurb. 
 I would not go back again. 
Rome however I would love to see again and for longer.

01,"overpriced, but great location","I had read previous reviews and was concerned.  Yes, the rooms are small.  We had 3 adults packed into 1 room, it was too small.  But, the location made up for any inconvenience.  Everything stops out front.  The hotel is in Bernini Square, which happens to be a very central location to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and just about everything else can be reached by bus, metro or taxi.  We had a problem with leaking water handle when you flushed the toilet, they sent a repairman up the next morning and he fixed it.  The television only gets a couple of american stations. The spa is quite good, except their English is very poor.  The breakfasts are quite good also.  They offer ""american breakfast buffet"" which has a lot of really good items. The concierge speaks good English and is quite helpful.  He helped us arrange a tour on a double decker bus where you get on and off to see the sites all day!

Stayed here 5/27/2006 - 5/28/2006.

01,Not recommended,"Stayed at the Bernini for 3 nights and would not recommend or rate this hotel as a *****L .  Easy walking distance to major attractions, however it is situated on a busy roundabout with heavy vehicular traffic.  Biggest complaint is the restrictions on use by residents of the rooftop bar at night.  My partner and I decided to have a night cap at 10:30 p.m. and were not allowed to sit at any of the 10 vacant tables to the front of the rooftop overlooking St. Peters.  These tables were reserved for diner guests - however there were only 2 diners left on the rooftop at this time (having drinks) and every other table was vacant and cleared.  We were rudely seated at the very back of the terrace.  I paid €352 per night precisely for the use of the terrace.  Also the drinks came from the ground floor bar area and took over 30 minutes to arrive.

01,Outstanding Hotel,"My husband and I went to Rome for our one year anniversary and stayed at the Hotel Bernini Bristol.  It was fabulous!  This is a five star hotel!  Our room and bathroom were spacious.  The bathroom was very large with two sinks, a large tub and shower.  The decor was very charming!

The hotel restaurant is a must.  The roof top garden was elegant and had marvelous views of Rome.  The food was also excellent.

The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is fantastic!  It is close to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain.  There is a subway stop very close to the enterance of the hotel and that was a great way to travel in Rome.    

The wireless high speed Internet was a huge plus.  

I would recommend this hotel to any one travelling to Rome and I would stay there again on my next visit.

I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel Bernini Bristol !

01,Don't Stay at the Bernini--the Rooms Are Teeny!,"We had seen the good reviews on Trip Advisor and so decided to book a room for our four day visit to Rome. I looked on Expedia and found a room for $350 a night. I assumed that at this price it would be a bit special. Sadly, our room was absolutely tiny, on the second floor and smelled of cigarette smoke. Worse, it had a double bed with a terrible, saggy mattress. Otherwise the hotel was clean and the location and staff were fine. It was not a disaster, just not worth $350 a night. (Breakfast was not included but there are many good places in the neighborhood). We go to  Europe several times a year so we are no stranger to small hotel rooms and I know that space is at a premium in Rome. But a few days later we got a junior suite on the 7th floor of the fabulous Lutetia Hotel in Paris (breakfast included) for only 405 euros a night--practically the same price as the teeny Bernini. We love the Bernini in Genoa but I would avoid the one in Rome and go to the Minerva  instead.

01,Excellent Experience at Bernini Bristol,"We just returned from a lovely trip to Italy, which ended with two days at the Bernini Bristol in Rome After mixed reviews here, I was a little anxious, but our stay was perfect.  The new windows completely obliterate the noise from the plaza. We had a beautifully remodeled room on the fifth floor overlooking the Bernini Triton Fountain.  Our package included breakfast and tickets to the Galleria Borghese (dont miss it). The staff, including the concierge, were professional and gracious.  We would return in a minute. I celebrated my 65th birthday with an outrageously overpriced but worth every penny dinner in the roof terrace restaurant and had a beautiful view of the sunset and of the lights coming on all over Rome, including St. Peter's.

01,Great Hotel,"Loved my stay at Bernini Bristol. The room was large and clean. Great location- 10 minutes to Spanish steps and Borghese Gallery and Park, 15 minutes to Trevi and Pantheon, 25-30 minutes to Piazza Navona. Metro stop right by, which gives you easy access to different areas of the city. Would stay here again.
",5,2006,04,14
01,Great location comes at a cost!,"The hotel's location is great - 5 min walk to the Spanish Steps or the Trevi Fountain! The underground is just in front of the door. Ask for rooms on the upper floors and to the side street to avoid being disturbed by too much traffic. The room decor is decent and has a contemporary feel - something rare in Italian hotel interiors. However, not a ""Design Hotel"" at all...we had a rather unpleasant surprise when checking out: we were charged breakfast and minibar although we never touched any of both! The restaurant manager confirmed that we had signed a bill which was not true. The receptionist, however, took these charges off the bill because she ""trusted"" us - what a grace! Better to keep off the breakfast anyway since they charge 30 Euros - plenty of bars in the area to get a typical Italian coffe and cornetto....All in all a nice experience, despite the ending. But the rooms come at a price...better check the internet for discount rates.

01,Decent hotel,"Very nice hotel; rooms are very spacious and the location is very handy.  Do not pay too much; the rooms are often discounted.
",4,2006,02,28
01,Do not pay too much for this hotel!,"We just back from Rome, Feb 12th to the 16th, 2006. This is our first time here and we chose to stay with Bernini Bristol. We book a jr. suite but we were upgraded to a full suite b/c they were renovating the floor that holds all the jr. suites (1st floor).
Some suites were renovated and others were not. But even with the renovation, I personally thought it still looked a little shabby not quite five star hotel as they claimed it to be. 
First our room was located on the second floor(a renovated one) which was really the third floor and we had to be moved because we faced Piazza Barberini. Now let me say this room looked a lot better then the room we moved to the next day. It was so noisy even with soundproof windows. They moved us to the 7th floor right side on the hotel(facing the piazza) and it was definitely a lot less noise. Now this room was not one of the renovated ones, the molding around the doorways was cracking and splitting apart, the sink fixtures were old, we had terrace(what a magnificent view!)the railing was rusting and cracked upwards, the glass on the terrace extremely dirty, the hooks that held the drapery back came coming out of the tapestry walls. The new soundproofed windows they did not finished with molding around it left it expose and drafty. The bathroom, toilet seat upper part half broken so we couldn't put the top part down, there was a towel holder that keeps towels warm, leaking hot water and stining the old marble floor. Tub has half glass door that swings and does not keep any water inside. The caulking job looks like a child did it. And when we took our showers, it goes from hot to cold NEVER remaining a constant temperature. The door handle of our bathroom was falling apart. The only new stuff we saw in this suit was the ceilings and halogen fixtures in the ceiling. Maybe it was just this room? But what made this room bearable is the view!

Breakfast: DO NOT GET this unless it is included! IT really sucks. It was included so we went to breakfast. A buffet setup but what they offer was very limited. It was more like a continental breakfast. They did have scrambled eggs but it was very mushy. Oh by the way it costs 30 Euros pp. And the service stinks, the waiters hang around talking to each other instead of taking care of customers.

Dinner: The restaurant which we ate there on the last night was really really good but OMG it was really EXPENSIVE! The restaurant is on the rooftop and it has a 360 degree view of the city. You can see ST. Peter's Basilica's dome, the Pantheon, etc.
Service was much better here and they have live music. Since it is winter here the outdoor area was closed but we could see it and it seem really nice. The nicest area in the whole hotel.

If you get a great I mean a out of this world price for this hotel then I would suggest staying here b/c it is centrally located. We walked everywhere! But if you had to pay full price or you just received a little discount I would suggest you stay in the area closer to The Villa Borghese as the hotels there, Westin Excelsior, Hotel Eden or true 5 star hotels!

But the overall experience was a four star
",3,2006,02,19
01,Great location!,"This hotel was in walking distance to Piazza Navonna and the Trevi Fountain.  Good near-by restaurants as well.
",4,2006,01,04
01,Great place for our Christmas holidays!,"Our stay couldn't have been better than that! It is true that it was the first time we were in Rome, but our stay at the Hotel Bernini Bristol meant a lot for the success of our honeymoon trip to Italy. The service was good and the room were small but neat!(in Italy they are truly very small compared to the States! but it seems it is normal for them!).  We also stayed at the Palazzo Sant'Angelo in Venice (part of the SINA Hotels group) and it was great to find the same high level standards of service! We are looking forward to coming back to Italy!

01,PRE AND POST CRUISE STAY,"We arrived the day before our  cruise.This Hotel is
 A ***** STAR....Our room was on the second floor
 over looking the Plaza windows opened to enlighten
 the feel( also had a window that opened onto a side
 street in the bathroom)and there where scales in
 the bath..We were scared to use them after the cruise LOL. Bar on the roof is great for sunsets.
 Very close to Spanish steps and the fountain.
They offer us( in english) a limo to the port
but it was 250 euros, so we took the train 6 euros
each.. and it was a blast.we will be back....

01,What a Relief!,"My wife and I were lucky to have found this website, and the reviews of this hotel that were posted at the time, only a day before our departure for Rome.  I say this because, after reading the reviews, and in particular the one dated September 18, we were sorely tempted to cancel our reservation and try our luck elsewhere.  However there was no time to do this and, this is why we feel lucky, as otherwise we would have missed a nice experience in this pleasant, and very conveniently located, hotel.

We stayed at the Bernini Bristol between September 30 and Oct. 4, in room 714 (on the left side of the hotel, which is, indeed, quieter). Our room was very nicely appointed and absolutely clean (after *much* looking, I found a *small* spot on one chair, and that was it!). After reading the reviews, we sort of expected to the hotel staff to be a bunch of very disagreeable people but, to our joy and relief, they were, without exception, absolutely charming, gracious and helpful and, yes, as soon as they saw us, each and every time they would offer a ""buon giorno"" or ""buona sera"" together with a smile.  My wife really took advantage of the concierge services for all sorts of advice, directions, reservations and miscellaneous help, which they invariably provided very graciously (and I only tipped them at the end of our stay, so it cannot be said that we bought their kindness).

This hotel's location is just GREAT!  We were able to walk to and from most places we went to visit.  This is definitely a plus.

One criticism and some caveats:
- The white wood panels in the elevators  (by the way, they worked flawlessly during our stay) were slightly grimy.  Hopefully, the hotel's management will read this and have them cleaned.
- The voltage is 220v throughout, INCLUDING the outlet in the bathroom (at least in our room), no matter what they say.  I almost fried my electric razor, but I was kind of expecting this and reacted quickly. So, bring your transformers/adapters (also for the round plugs that they use there)
- As most European hotels, they provide no American-style washcloths, so, if you're used to them for shaving and/or showering, bring your own.
- Limited TV offerings in English (not terribly important, as you are not there to watch TV anyway!)
- Utter lack of wall hooks to hang things from (like your pajamas, or even the nice terry cloth robes that they provide)
- The safe, indeed, takes eight digits instead of 4, and no instructions were provided.  Things to the reviewer of September 25, I was able to figure this one out pretty quickly, though.
- I was going to say ""limited closet space"" until we went to Venice, afterwards, and found the true meaning of the term.

We plan to return to Roma in the relatively near future, with our kids this time, and we would be very willing to stay at the Bernini Bristol again.
",4,2005,11,08
01,Excellent Hotel      Best have ever stayed in,"Myself and my friend chose to stay at this hotel upon recommendation from family members.
Having read some of the reviews from this site   I was very disappointed and dubious about staying there. 
Arrived quite late in evening, greeted by an extremely nice gentleman at the desk who had excellent english and was very informative.
He arranged a table at the nearby Tullio restaurant and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner among lovely people.
I was astonished to find that the hotel was completely different from some of these reviews. In our opinion this most certainly is of 5 star rating if not more. We stayed in a junior suite ,which,if rather expensive, was worth every cent for the luxury.
The location is excellent and I would reccomend this Hotel to anyone wishing to experience Rome.
Having travelled the world and stayed at some of the most luxurious Hotels , I can safely say the Bernini Bristol is in the top five.
",5,2005,10,29
01,Not overly impressed,"I was really looking forward to staying in this hotel because from their website it looked amazing and I wanted to start our trip with some luxuary. I was dissapointed however when we arrived after such a long flight (18 hours from Sydney) to find that this hotel has passed its days of grandure. The rooms were very small and tired with the decorating looking like it had not been refreshed for a long time. We also were dissapointed to find our ""double bed"" was infact two singles pushed together making for four very uncomfortable nights sleep and not what you would expect from a five star hotel. The staff were generally helpful however they were not overly friendly. The breakfast was not well stocked and if you arrived later than 8.30am several of the items were gone all together. The location however is great and in easy walking distance to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. I would not however reccommend the hotel to anyone.
",3,2005,10,23
01,Terrible. Worst Hotel I ever stayed at.,"First of all I was checked into a room which had a connecting door to another room, smelled very badly and the toilet was broken. A man came up to fix the toilet, he did not fix it. So they moved me and my husband to another room. The room had stain carpets all over. It was very small. The bathroom wall had mold all over, I had to be extra careful not to get near the mold while showering. While I was blow drying my hair I smelled urine. I realized the floor behind the toilet was embedded with urination.  Then the shower broke. I called to complain. Some man came up and tried to fix it and and painted the wall to cover the mold. But it was still there and he couldnt fix the shower. I was in the room for 4 hours while he was doing this because my husband needed to shower. 
I was told by one of the hotel staff members that I would have to shower down the hall in a different room.
I was furious at this point. I felt like I was in a cheap motel not a 5 star hotel which I payed alot of money for.
So I demanded another room. He did not want to give it to me, after argueing for an hour he finally agreed. He took me to the new room and the lock was jammed, he tried opening it for 15 minutes, he could not get in so he finally got a key for a different room which was much better, no urination, stains, mold, or broken toilets and showers.

The worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life!!!!!!!!!
",1,2005,10,16
01,Perfect location and great hotel!,"We were kind of scared about staying here after reading some of the other reviews, but upon arrival, we quickly found out that all of our concerns were unnecessary!  The hotel is in a great location - walking distance to all sights, close to supermarket, lots of restaurants, close to train station!  Our room was perfect - we didn't hear any noise at all, we had our own balcony that was surrounded by bushes, our room was very clean and large, and the breakfast was super good.  It was also really easy to work with the hotel to book our stay and to work with the concierge over email to book tours in advance.  All around - great hotel for a visit to Rome.
",4,2005,10,14
01,Great Stay,"We stayed in this hotel in mid September and it was a lovely stay. The room was clean and well kept with all the usual essentials provided – including those wrapped up slippers! The staff were polite and more than willing to help. We had a candle lit dinner on the top floor of this hotel with wonderful views of Rome and St Peter's – it was unforgettable. The food was also very good served with care and a sense of pride we could not fault. Getting there was easy with the Metro very close by. The only slight problem was the Spa which was working although the sauna and steam room were fine.  I would also recommend the La Corte Dei Leoni which is a good restaurant just around the corner from this hotel. It provided good food and more than met my expectations. 

I would happily recommend this hotel to friends and family. Next time we go to Rome, I would be happy to stay there again. It truly was a magical trip.
",4,2005,10,04
01,Average all the way around,"I stayed here for 7 days in September 2005 and would rate this hotel as average. A few tips...don't expect The Westin. That is about a 1/4 mile up the road on Via Veneto. I did not, however, have the terrible experience that the traveler from Hershey, PA had. When using the safe it is an 8 digit code, not the standard 4. Having not travelled in Europe in many years, it took us a little bit to figure it out. Request to stay in a room on the left side of the hotel (the left when you are facing the hotel from outside). There is considerably less street noise and scooter alarms going off. I stayed on both sides and the right side is a lot noisier. The hot tub near the gym was not in service, which was disappointing. But I thought the location was just fabulous. It was easy to get anywhere in the city and access to the metro was right outside. We did not visit the restaurant or dine there as there were so many other wonderful places outside of the hotel.
",3,2005,09,25
01,Very Rundown and Poor Service,"We had stayed here during our honeymoon to Italy, and I had been excited about this hotel by the former rave reviews.  Don't believe the good reviews in the Bernini Bristol.  We stayed in 4 and 5 star properties during this trip and we were sorely disappointed in this hotel.  Despite a recent renovations, there was worn and stained carpeting in the lobby.  During our check-in, I overheard that someone was stuck in the front lobby elevator for an hour.  The front desk had lost our reservation, even though I had confirmed this reservation twice just two days before via e-mail and phone.  The front desk did find us a room, however, a handicapped room.  We had to take a service elevator to the room because none of the elevators worked.  The room was very plainly decorated and boring.  The room safe did not work.  I called the front desk to have the safe repaired.  They never fixed it.  Having no options, we stashed two hundred dollars cash in the closet.  The money was stolen while we were gone.  I complained about the room and the service to the hotel manager.  He gave us a voucher for a drink at the rooftop bar and restaurant.  The restaurant was open for only one night during our stay, and was completely booked for a private event.  The hotel manager knew we would not be able to use this voucher.  The only decent thing about this place is the breakfast, which ironically serves complimentary sparkling wine with the buffet.  You definitely need liquor to stomach this place.  If you are thinking of staying here, think again.  I have stayed nearby at the St. Regis Rome and the Mascagni.  Both hotels provide Old World elegance and service.  Stay away from the Bernini Bristol if you want a pleasant hotel stay.

01,5 Star Hotel!!!,"We arrived at the Hotel Bernini Bristol around 11:00 am to find out that are rooms were not only ready early but they were also upgraded. My wife and I had a view of the Plaza Barberini on the 4th floor. Our room was spacious and accomodating. We especially liked having a safe that we could use at all times. The bedding was turned down every night on cue. Our bathroom was enormous and ornate. I especially appreciated the jacuzzi tub each night after a long day of walking around Rome. We had dinner at the restuarant on top of the hotel which was fabulous. Make sure that you get reservations for a view of the city. Brunch was also fabulous but expensive. There is plenty of shopping and plenty of major attractions within walking distance. The hotel staff was polite and accomodating. They always welcomed my family with a smile. At no time did we ever feel not welcome. This hotel was a great location and definetly an establishment I will be returning to.
",5,2005,07,13
01,What a Let Down,"We stayed here during our honeymoon & unfortunately found it a real let down compared with the other hotels we visited.  

Of course, being a city hotel, you can't expect the same views or relaxed ambiance of somewhere like Tuscany or Sorrento, but what you can/should expect from a supposed 5 star deluxe hotel is comparable levels of service.  

From the start we found the staff fairly disinterested & aloof.  The woman checking us in walked off half way through gesturing at another member of staff to complete the process.  The lift took a while to arrive so the porter took us up in the service lift instead (via the kitchens), and when we got there, the room was very small with dirty marks on the wall. Things didn't improve over breakfast when we found the food buffet half stocked, had to get our own cutlery & received coffee when we'd asked for tea.

Any one of the above in isolation we'd probably have ignored or laughed off (the porter was probably only trying to help by avoiding delays afterall), but altogether it made for a disappointing stay & not something we'd expect from a 3 star hotel - when you've paid out for a 5 star, it's just maddening.  This was in total contrast to another Sina Group hotel we finished the honeymoon in, the Villa Medici in Florence, where the service was exeptional & proved that just because it's a city location doesn't have to mean indifferent service.

The location is good & the rooftop bar area well worth a vist especially as the sun sets, but based on our overall experience we'd never stay there again.
",1,2005,07,06
01,"Great Location, Tired Hotel","Superb location is the primary reason to stay. Many of the guests at breakfast were the actors and crew from a British film company. We spent five nights in junior suite in May 2004.  Carpeting, upholstery, etc. was somewhat dated and worn and carpeting in hallways was disappointingly stained.  A/C quite noisy and required attention from building staff.  AC was required because there was no air circulation in the room which was very stale. Initially, we had horrible brown water in shower/tub which was corrected by building staff - apparently room had not been used in some time. To their credit, this was taken care of immediately. Housekeeping congregates and chats in the hallways on room floors and didn't return a buon giornio once. Front desk was truly warm and welcoming or frosty and unresponsive depending who was at the desk. Roof top restaurant very expensive and less than ""fair"" rating in a city where it is very easy to eat well.  We freely spend a small fortune on food so price was not the issue - but quality and value. The view from the roof terrace is absolutely beautiful and it's worth having a drink there. The glassed in restaurant across the street with the yellow lamp shades (you can't miss it) can be expensive but the money is well spent - excellent wine list, service and food.  Turbot with potato crust is truly memorable - lovely people too.  Summary - rather ordinary and no wonderful memories of the hotel, which is always the reason to go back to stay at someplace you've been.

01,A Real Treat,"My husband and I stayed at the Bernini Bristol June 2005 for 2 nights.  It was the end of a 16 day trip throughout Italy.  We decided to treat ourselves after 2 weeks of budget hotels.  We used American Express points for our stay so am not sure what the rate would have been during that time.  Max for that room was supposed to be 560 Euro.  Don't know if I would have paid that, but worth the accumulated points.  
Rooms are clean and spacious, but ours did not have much of a view.  Bathrooms were marble with a full BATHTUB:)

Some cons:
-Housekeeping entered our room without knocking for ""turn down"" service as we were getting ready to go out for dinner.  Fortunately we were still dressed.
-Breakfast was not included, but for 30 Euros per person you can have it.  Instead, go around the corner, behind the hotel entrance and past the internet cafe for outdoor cafe with great coffee and pastries.    
-Jacuzzi is only open until 9:30pm.  We wanted to take advantage of that luxury, but were not back from dinner on time.
-Tried to charge us for mini bar charges for things we had not taken.  Didn't argue when I promised we had left the 6 Euro water alone.

On the plus side:
-We arrived early and they offered to hold our luggage since room wasn't ready yet.  Also made available gym if we wanted to freshen up.  
-Concierge very helpful.  Arranged for airport transportation and reccomended a place to grab coffee before we headed out.
-Internet cafe across the street with plenty of terminals.
-Rooftop restaurant worth the price of a drink.  Did not have dinner there, but on our last night went up for a cocktail.  Servers told us we were allowed to leave the bar area to get a better view and even took our picture for us.  The view is amazing and piano music great.
-All staff speaks English, which we don't expect....but nice anyway.  

So, if you can stay at the Bernini Bristol...do so.  It is a nice treat for couples!

01,Good base for Rome sightseeing,"We enjoyed our stay at the Bernini Bristol from 10th June to 13th June 2005.  The hotel is very clean, great location and the staff are friendly and helpful.  When booking the hotel we paid extra for a room upgrade to an Executive, which was larger than we expected and had a marble bathroom.  Upon arrival we did discover an open bottle of water in the mini bar (see TripAdvisor Review dated 27th May), but we informed reception and were never charged for this.  In our opinion this is not a five star hotel and we therefore believe that you’ll enjoy your stay at this hotel if you expect four star standards.  Prior to departure we had read the TripAdvisor Review dated May 2nd 2005 regarding “The breakfast is fantastic and was included in the hotel price”.  Please remember to check if the breakfast is included in your price.  We assumed it was included but discovered upon check-out that it wasn’t and was stunned to discover an additional charge of 125.40 Euros.  Whilst the breakfast was good, it wasn’t worth 21 Euros and if we had known, we would have gone elsewhere.  The receptionist told us that this was a discounted breakfast price and that it is 27 Euros per a person in their 2005 tariff sheet.  As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is a few steps away from the Barberini Metro, which is 1 Euro to go anywhere, and was useful to get to the major tourist spots early.  This stop is also just two metro stops from Termini, where you can transfer to the main station (10 minute walk which is signposted) and catch a train back to Fiumicino Airport for 11 Euros.

01,Great place to stay in Rome,"We had a great stay at this hotel.  Room was nice, clean and not as small as we expected.  The location was excellent...right in the middle of everything.  Service was great.  We had a fresh new room with new towels every time we left the room.  There was also an internet cafe across the street, which was very convenient.
We would definitely recommend this hotel to others visiting Rome.
",4,2005,06,04
01,Never Again!,"Well what can we say..our 'deluxe' room was v. average, the bathroom was tiny and there were chips in the bath...if this is a 5 star deluxe hotel I dread to see the standard of lesser graded hotels...
The minibar had half eaten bars of chocolate and already opened bottles...
The only good point concerning the hotel is the location...right next to the metro and in a great spot for restaurants / sights.
",2,2005,05,27
01,Ideal location,"Our 6 night stay at the Bernini Bristol was great. I had read some less than stellar reviews on this site, so I thought I would speak up for the hotel. Its location is ideal for those who plan to travel throughout the city like my wife and I did. Steps away from the metro, internet cafe, walkable to churches, museums, restaurants - you name it. The breakfast is fantastic and was included in the hotel price, it was also a full ""American"" breakfast that even included champagne. The rooms, while not glamorous, were surprisingly large. The bathroom was very spacious as well. The construction that was going on to the facade did not in any way interfere with our stay. The roof top restaurant is pricey, but the staff are courteous and flexible. The food was good and the views were great. The exercise room is very small, but has good equipment. Fortunately, when I was using it no one else was so the lack of much equipment wasn't a big deal. I would recommend they add some more aerobic equipment. We plan to stay there again when we visit in 2 years.

01,BRILLIANT BERNINI,"Stayed at the Bernini for 4 nights over the easter weekend.  A fabulous choice.  Central location, very comfortable accommodation although room was on small side it had huge bathroom and a balcony overlooking the Bernini fountain. Fabulous views to St Peter's from the rooftop bar.  Breakfast extensive and saw us through until tea time!  Service was efficient.  Plan to go back in October when I take my mother to see the Sistine Chapel.
",5,2005,04,28
01,Beautiful Bernini,"My wife and I spent three nights of our honeymoon at the Bernini Bristol, and found nothing but the warmest service.  The location is good if you want high-end shopping and the Spanish Steps, not as good if you prefer more quaint neighborhoods like Trastevere or Campo De Fiori.  Extra bonus for Dan Brown fans - the hotel is right by one of the major locations in Angels and Demons, and not far from Santa Maria di Popolo.  
     The hotel staff was very welcoming, and the decor is beautiful.  The rooms are not luxurious, but are extremely comfortable.  We prefer the neighborhoods further south, but if you want something near the Via Veneto and the Spanish Steps, you can't go wrong with Bernini Bristol.
",5,2005,04,26
01,Our end to a lovely vacation,"My husband and I concluded our cruise trip in Rome November 1st,2004.  This is the second time our cruise has ended in Rome and we were delighted to get our same room each time at the Bernini.  It faced the Piazza and when you looked out late at night it was quiet and serene but during the day you had the hustle and bustle.  The hotel is extremely clean and the staff is extremely helpful.  They arranged each time for a car to be ready early in the AM to take us to the airport to make sure we were cleared for out trip back to the United States.

The only thing I didn't care for was the mattress in our room the second time.  I didn't remember it the first trip but it felt like a flat bed, no cushion to the mattress.

I love the location it is so near everything that you can't get lost. We also found a cozy restaurant across from the hotel called Ciao Bella where we had a lovely meal in a cozy dining area.

We certainly hope to return to Rome in the near future and will by all means stay at the Bernini.
",4,2005,04,05
01,Loved the Bernini!,"The location is excellent. We easily took the train from the airport to the hotel. The breakfast was magnificent! Nice service, and excellent selection of food. We walked to All of the major sites from this hotel. It was very clean, with a lovely, large bathroom.  We would highly recommend this hotel.

01,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed at the Bernini Bristol this past weekend, and our experience was wonderful. The construction mentioned in a number of earlier reviews has obviously ended; we saw no signs of any work being done. Our room was large and comfortable. Food at the roof-top restaurant was excellent, although it was raining and there wasn't really much to see. Breakfast was one of the best we have ever had and was served in a lovely dining room on the second floor. The hotel is centrally located and is convenient to most tourist sights.
",5,2005,02,28
01,Spent birthday at this hotel,"I was sorry to leave the Bernini Bristol in Rome. True, there is currently some work going on, but scaffolding does not obscure views.
    My room had a king size bed - lovely linen. Everything was spotlessly clean. Bathroom large enough to hold a reception in.
    
    But, the main PLUS for me was  the courtesy of the staff. They all speak excellent English so they do not expect you to stammer in broken Italian. What you ask for you get, with a smile and it's first-class, any time day or night.
    
    Fantastic roof-top restaurant with stunning views over city - food fit enough for any gourmet. Charming piano player.  The bar is something else as well.
    
    If you are the kind of visitor who only wants a bed for the night, prefers to dress in trainers and sporty outfits, this hotel is not for you. It's an elegant establishment with a great history of accomplished and famous guests - be prepared to do the place justice.",5,2005,02,09
01,Not worth trying,"I don't recommend this hotel at all. We stayed there in March and although the location is good, the rooms are old and poorly styled and many rooms face the side of other buildings. The staff was quite friendly, but that was all. Definitely not a 5 star hotel, next time I go to Rome I'll stay somewhere else...
",1,2005,01,19
01,no View,"The whole hotel is covered in a sheet and scaffolding, no where does it say this when I booked the hotel, I would never stay there if I knew. Men were walking outside my window on the scaffolding peeking in, I was terrified.
The Heat was shut off every night until 10 pm, I froze. The staff could not care less.  Not a 5 star hotel.
",1,2005,01,03
01,Definitely recommend,"I was very pleased with our experience at the Bernini Bristol.  When we first drove up, it didn't seem that impressive from the outside and my heart sank a bit.  But all the staff personnel were professional and friendly, and very helpful, and our room was beautiful (I loved the padded upholstered walls trimmed in thick cording).  The workout room was adequate.  The included breakfasts were wonderful and lavish, served in an Old World dining room overlooking the square - with handsome, tuxedo'd waiters refilling cappucinno and coffee as quickly as one could drink it.  The rooftop dinner with live piano music, overlooking the city lights of Rome is not to be missed - although pricey and not the best meal we had in Italy.  Yet worth it for the experience.  (I did come to realize that my long blond curly hair and green eyes afforded me more male attention than I usually receive in LA).  The location, within an easy walk of Trevi Foundation, the Spanish Steps, and right in front of a metro station and Internet cafe - was very convenient.",4,2005,01,02
01,Good location but not 5 star luxury.,"Was a little disappointed by the Bernini Bristol, our room was nice and clean but definitely not 5 star luxury.  The shutter on the window wouldn't stay up and the whole hotel is covered in scaffolding and sheeting at the moment so we had no natural light coming in.  Also our large double window did not lock.  We reported it to the concierge but they didn't fix it.  Probably okay normally as it was on 4th floor but with scaffolding platforms etc it could easily be opened with just a little push from the outside.  We didn't leave any valuables in the room and were out most of the time so weren't too worried but some may find it a bit alarming.

Anyone staying there in the near future would be advised to get in touch with the hotel if they are expecting a room with a view to find out when the work will be completed.

Apart from that, the staff were very friendly and it is a good location beside the metro station and close to attractions but we walked everywhere, even to the Vatican.

01,bernini bristol is great!,"Bernini Bristol is a wonderful hotel.  The location can not be beat.  The Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and Borghese Gallery are all within very easy walking distance.  A little farther, but still very easily reached on foot are the Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Piazza Venezia, Colosseum and Forum.  The service was excellent and I found the staff very attentive. The jacuzzi in my room was a welcomed surprise.  The restaurant is a splurge, but well worth it for at least one meal.
",5,2004,12,13
01,great location,"Chose the Bernini Bristol Hotel on the back of the good reviews on this site and wasn't disappointed. The location of the hotel is excellent - 5 mins walk from Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain, and easily walkable (20-25mins) to the Roman Forum and Colloseum. There's also a Metro station  right outside the hotel.

The rooms were surprisingly large, clean and well-equipped. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but ate on the rooftop restaurant, which although expensive (~50 euro pp) has a breathtaking view over Rome.

01,"Nice hotel, nice location","My wife and I stayed here on 10/7/04 and 10/8/04.  The hotel was conveniently located thirty feet from a metro stattion so if you arrive to Rome by train you can take the metro for 1 euro to the hotel.  The hotel itself was very nice.   There is a health spa in the basement of the hotel with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.  So after walking around Rome all day, this was a nice place to rest your feet.  The hotel room was great except for a mosquito that kept harassing us all night.  

There is a wonderful restaurant across the street Ristorante Conte Di Galluccio, make reservations to sit outside!  Walter, the restaurant's owner has to be one of the nicest guys I have ever met.

01,WONDERFUL IN EVERY WAY!,"This hotel was perfect!  The room was gorgeously decorated, and although it was somewhat small, it had everything we needed.  The bathroom, was almost the size of the bedroom- decorated in gorgeous marble with a large tub!  The staff was amazing, and the room service was really fast and really good (try the ham)!  An added bonus at this hotel is the fabulous rooftop deck/restaurant- perfect for an afternoon snack or a romantic dinner overlooking the city!  Also, you can walk everywhere or just have the doorman grab you a taxi- and for those who just can't get away from their email- the internet cafe is right across the street!!!  I thought this hotel was a really great find- and the decor is very elegant and in good taste- I will return!!!

01,Great Location,"The location to this hotel was great.  We were within walking distance to many good places to eat, the Trevi Fountain, Panthenon, Piazza Navona, and the spanish steps.

01,"beautiful, clean, quiet location","This hotel was within walking distance of many restaurants, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps.  It was a $7. cab ride to the Vatican.  Our room was absolutely beautiful with a nice sitting area.  We had requested early check-in but room was not available until normal check in time.  Staff was not all that service oriented but hotel was very clean and quiet and I would recomend it.  Any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.

01,Decent hotel in good location,"Well located hotel in busy piazza. Close to most attractions which are a walkable distance. Also near metro. Room was large and with all usual mod-cons. Buffet breakfast decidedly average. Good choice of hotel for a reasonable rate.

01,Great Hotel!,"Prior to my arrival to Rome I switched my hotel three times before I selected the Bernini Bristol, and I was very happy with my choice to stay there. This hotel is right at the base of the Via Veneto area, which in my opinion is the best place to stay in all of Rome.  The hotel is conveniently located to a lot of the major sites, Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and the Spanish Steps to name a few.  The Barberini Metro station is right next to the hotel.

The rooms were very comfortable, and spacious for European standards.  The windows had automatic blinds that could be used to totally block out any light or sound from the outside.  The only complaint that had about the room was the lack of water pressure in the shower, but most of Europe has little water pressure.

The service was excellent, the front desk staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful.  On about my fifth day there I arrived back to my room after a long day of sight seeing to find a wonderful platter of fruit compliments of the General Manager, this was a great surprise at the end of the day.

All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Bernini Bristol, and I will definitely be staying there again
",5,2004,08,30
01,"Great hotel, excellent location, good value","Loved the hotel. Excellent location. Big plus is Metro station at front door of hotel. You can get from airport economically by taking train to Termini station and changing to red line and going one stop to Barberini. Also, Metro gives you easy access to all major tourist attractions. Nice internet cafe across street from hotel. The staff are very polite and friendly. Excellent glass enclosed  restaurant across street. Hotel just recently renovated and all rooms have been freshly painted and carpeted. The bathroom is on small side and I did not like way toilet flushed. Hotel is located on quiet street with restricted traffic. All in all a great hotel that I would definitely stay in again.

01,"A great Rome Hotel -- under-rated excellence in service, location and decor","We have been here over ten times and never been disappointed.  The SINA chain is just great (see in particular our favorites:  their Villa Medici in Frienze, ------------------, and their excellent hotel in Venice, Palazzo Sant'Angelo, -------------------------, in Milan delaville@sinahotels.it , among others, and the SINA website -----------------).   Also in Perugia is an amazing underground pool with ancient stone ruins under the glass-bottomed pool, at ---------------------  See the Bernini site at ---------------------.

Bernini Bristol has a wonderful health club with giant jacuzzi, steam and sauna, with lots of marble and decor in the sense of the Roman bath, and is relaxing indeed.  The rooms are exquisitely decorated with brocaded and padded silk upholstry on the walls, colorful and comfortable furniture, and marble bathrooms that are luxurious and spacious.  The staff and concierge are knowledgeable and helpful;  the location is excellent, providing a central starting point for walks throughout Rome.  The Bernini is at the foot of via Veneto, and coming out of the Bernini, one is next to the Cappucino Church and Crypt (great skull and bones collection!) a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and the via Condotti shopping, and 15 minutes from the Trevi Fountains and a few minutes farther is Piazza Navona.  You are 20 minutes away from the Pantheon and the best gelato (try the wonderful shaved ice granita -- made by hand not machine -- in lemon, grapefruit and other flavors) at Giollitti's.

The Piazza Barberini  has the wonderful (and underrated) fountain of Tritone, and the only downside is that you are within 200 meters of the Planet Hollywood (ugh).

Again, the staff is just wonderful, and go out of their way to be helpful, unlike some conceited staff in other 5 star hotels that make you feel like they are doing you a favor.  The concierge always got us tickets to opera, music and the like.  

We love them!  Best, Michael Hartmann

01,Great Hotel,"The Bernini Bristol is the ideal place to stay while in Rome. This great hotel is near everything, has an excellent staff, and wonderful rooms.

01,Nice Four Star,"Excellent & friendly reception - they upgraded us to a suite (506/507), due to our anniversary.  2 Room suite with hallway was very large & had balcony facing Triton Fountain - I believe only the front rooms on floor 5 have balconies.  Very comfortable, somewhat worn room & public areas.  Beautiful restaurant l'Olimpo on top of hotel - spectacular views & outside terrace.  They didn't have our resv that their concierge made, but no problem.  Food was good, service was hilarious it was so bad, but makes for good stories...  A nice hotel at an excellent rate (I got the Summit 321E rate), but I wouldn't call it a 5 star.  We would definitely come back at this rate & if we could get that suite again - great for jet-lagged couples waking & sleeping at different times!",4,2004,06,14
01,A View from a Rooftop,"Great location, cute bellmen, nice rooms and a fabulous rooftop bar/restaurant with a view of St. Peter's.  We went up there every evening for a night cap.  We would definitely stay here again - We threw coins in the Trevi Fountain, so I know we are coming back!

To those of you who gave a bad review of this hotel...get a life, you obviously have not travelled much and especially in Europe.  European hotels are much different than the US...one needs to bear that in mind when traveling.

01,"Lovley Hotel, excellent choice.","My sister and I stayed at the Bernini Bristol Hotel for four nights, the second week in April 2004. We had a De Luxe room (including breakfast) overlooking the Piazza. The hotel was beautifully furnished and decorated. Our room was lovely, large and spotlessly clean with plenty of wardrobe space. The double glazing coped well with the Rome traffic! Our bed sheets were changed every day.The bathroom was very good, lovely soft towels and loads of hot water. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. The staff were most attentive exactly what would expect from a 5 star De Luxe Hotel. The hotel was in an excellent position for seeing Rome and was a wonderful haven after a busy day sightseeing. I would most definately return. I would not want to visit Rome any later in the year as it was very hot even for April, but a wonderful city nevertheless.",5,2004,04,27

The workout gym is extensive and has a hot tub, steam room and sauna to go with modern equipment. However, the highlight of the hotel is their staff.

Next door is an Internet cafe, and the Via Veneto begins on the other side. We probably wouldn't have spent as much ordinarily, but for a special occasion, it was worth it.

It's not very far from any major place to see in Rome (ex: Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Via Condotti, Hard Rock Cafe....etc). The room is nice and clean, but of course you can't compare it to a 5 stars hotel in US. 
The concierge people were very helpful. The complimentary breakfast were great and the server were very nice (again, just like any regular continental breaskfast, you can't expect like in major US 5 stars hotel in US).

The room is spacious but is really in need of repair. The hotel is in good location and you can walk for 10 minutes from shopping areas like Via del Corso. The breakfast is terrible and most are cold items. Don't trouble with the breakfast if that's not include in your room rate! 
Anyway, the hotel is an acceptable hotel in Central Rome!",3,2003,11,01

The Restaurant Olympus on top is truly as good or better than the best in SF, and more original, and the service always impeccable.  The people there are wonderful and they try to please.   Always.

Excellent breakfast where Simone's sympathy and professionalism stands out .",5,2024,06,24
01,Disappointing and noisy,"A classic of Rome, this Bernini. I am writing a new review after renovation. Always beautiful building, very Roman, and perfectly located in the heart of the capital. Roof top always very nice with an amazing view.
You may like the renovation or not, it's a matter of taste, I don't like the burgundy/purple colors that dominate and create a sad atmosphere.
The rooms are of an average standard, and are not large, not 5 star.
The staff is up to par: very welcoming, courteous and professional.
Two important negative points:
- too loud! The (closed) doors that allow you to connect two neighboring rooms are poorly insulated: you can easily hear your neighbor getting up, talking, turning on the TV, going to the bathroom... moreover, the windows are of poor quality and the noise from cars via Barberini is very present. Unacceptable for a hotel of this level.
- breakfast could be improved: no fresh fruit (not already cut), and the loaves to be sliced yourself are touched by all customers since there is no napkin to hold them.
All in all, a hotel that is not 5 stars, and not worth the price paid.",3,2024,01,31

Ma della serie al peggio non c'è mai fine, cena al rooftop. Nella peggior trattoria si sarebbe mangiato meglio; prosciutto di massa, forse confezionato; bufala ghiacciata di frigo e un secondo di carne immangiabile. Risposta?

01,un compleanno da favola,"Per festeggiare  il compleanno di mio marito abbiamo soggiornato in questo fantastico albergo il personale cortese ed educato, abbiamo avuto un upgrade della camera fantastico , una camera con balcone vista piazza ( spettacolare), cena con vista stupenda , cibo buono, quando siamo arrivati in camera abbiamo trovato una bottiglia di prosecco offerta dall'albergo, camera insonorizzata e completa di tutto , letto comodissimo  abbiamo dormito benissimo , la colazione semplice ma sul menu c'è la possibilità di ordinare di tutto insomma ci hanno coccolati . Grazie per aver reso questo compleanno indimenticabile",5,2021,06,16
01,Due giorni da ricordare,"Servizio eccellente. Oltre ad aver ricevuto un (notevole) upgrade della sistemazione prenotata, siamo stati coccolati dall’arrivo alla partenza dalle attenzioni di tutto il personale, con menzione speciale per il responsabile del ricevimento Marco. La terrazza della colazione/ristorante offre una vista su Roma a mio giudizio senza rivali, e il servizio ha sempre saputo trovare il giusto equilibrio fra l’estrema professionalità e l’empatia con il cliente. Torneremo senz’altro.",5,2021,05,31
01,Coccolato nel centro di Roma,"Passato due notti con la famiglia. Consiglio aperitivo con vista su tutta Roma mozzafiato. Tutti estremamente gentili. Camera molto bella e accogliente. Ottimo servizio, super colazione. Centrale a tutte le attrazioni disella città Ritorneremo",5,2021,05,28
01,LE STELLE CADUTE DAL CIELO,"Al vostro arrivo sarete accolti da personale di front office cortese ed educato, tuttavia nessuno si occuperà dei vostri bagagli, nessuno vi accompagnerà in camera, nessuno vi domanderà se desiderate una seconda chiave, nessuno vi darà indicazioni su orari di cena e colazione ed altri servizi (nel caso ci fossero...)
I saloni sono sontuosi ed eleganti, tuttavia se scendete nel dettaglio, soprattutto della vostra juniorsuite da 700 euro a notte, troverete briciole sul divano, molta polvere, un restauro approssimativo, parquet rovinati all'incrocio con le pareti, un armadio a muro con ripiani in legno da pensione tipo ""nonna Pina"".
 Ottima la biancheria da bagno, tuttavia cercherete inutilmente le ciabattine da camera.
Alla cena vi sarà presentato un menù (giustamente con qr code) di levatura assolutamente inadeguata ad un 5 stelle, così come la carta dei vini; la cucina è in linea con la carta, non cattiva ma assai modesta, nei contenuti e nelle preparazioni... piuttosto casalinghe.
Su quattro bollicine l'unica che scegliete non c'è, ed al posto di un Ferrari vi sarà proposto un prosecco di valdobbiadene (sappimo distinguere il targhet del cliente?); inoltre troverete lo stesso prosecco a 90 euro sul conto con altra dicitura e quando lo farete notare vi verrà offerto inelegantemente uno sconto di 20 euro, anzichè ammettere l'errore e bannare la voce (come sarebbe stato assai più opportuno.. il costo di un prosecco gira intorno agli 8 euro in enoteca)
Siete scesi in hotel con SPA in quanto vostra moglie resterà da sola per un'intera giornata durante i vostri impegni di lavoro ma scoprirete solo al vostro arrivo che l'area benessere è chiusa ed inutilizzabile. Se vi permettete di segnalare il mancato avviso vi risponderanno che è obbligo governativo in tutta Italia (???) così come dovreste sapere da soli che non si passa con il semaforo rosso; peccato che avete appena frequentato altre strutture dove, con le dovute precauzioni anticovid, l'area benessere è perfettamente funzionante.
Qualcuno farà ammenda di questo peccato di ""consapevole"" omissione facendovi uno sconto sul prezzo della camera? Certamente no.. sarete liquidati in un clima di incolpevole palpabile imbarazzo.
Siete poco attenti e avete dimenticato il talloncino ""do not disturb""alla porta della vostra camera; tuttavia nonostante l'errore altamente probabile, pur nella vostra assenza per tutto il pomeriggio, nessuno proverà a bussare o telefonare per verificarlo e la vostra stanza resterà da riordinare, così come nessuno si occuperà di prepararla per la notte con i consueti scendiletto e cioccolatino al seguito (cercate di ricordare che siete in un ***** ma proprio non ce la fate)
La colazione è servita sul terrazzo panoramico ma è così modesta e la caffetteria da ""bar sport"" che vi vien voglia di farla altrove. Anche qui s'intende, tutti cordiali e disponibili.
E' giunta l'ora della partenza e naturalmente nessuno vi domanderà se avete bisogno di una mano per i bagagli..
Che dire, ogni altro riferimento è del tutto superfluo.. Se desiderate un ottimo tre stelle potete accomodarvi al Bernini Bristol ma con carta di credito molto molto ben rifornita e con la mascherina si, ma quella da aereo, che non toglierete mai per non vedere cosa vi accade intorno)  Auguri!",2,2021,05,11
01,Non è un 5 stelle !!!! ,"Non saprei da dove iniziare . Io e mio marito è da anni che non viviamo un esperienza simile . 
L’hotel non offre i servizi indispensabili ( previsti per un 5 stelle ) infatti alla richiesta alle 14.45 di poter avere un sandwich , ci e stato risposto che non era possibile perché lo chef era già andato a casa . La mattina seguente avevamo prenotato la colazione per le 8 in camera , ma alle 8.45 ancora non era arrivata , costringendoci a rinunciare per impegni . 
Ma arriviamo al problema più grave : la pulizia !! La suite non solo era trascurata, e necessitava di manutenzione, ma addirittura sembrava non fosse stata pulita !! Abbiamo chiamato subito in reception( ore 15.00) ma non c’era personale per le pulizie e non sarebbe arrivato fino al giorno seguente ( in un 5 stelle , mai capitato ) 
Unica cosa apprezzabile : la disponibilità del personale , che nonostante non fosse addetto alle pulizie si è offerto di ripulire la camera , dopo aver visto le condizioni . 
Certamente la vista che offre la terrazza della suite è indiscutibile , ma non basta per colmare il disagio provato ! 
Mi dispiace molto , raramente lascio recensioni negative , ma credo che l’Italia e la sua splendida capitale, meritino di essere rappresentate meglio di così !

01,Assolutamente non adeguato,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti in questo hotel, che è molto bello e in una posizione ottima. Peccato però che l’ultimo giorno ho avuto grossi problemi con l’acqua della doccia, che dopo 15 minuti che scorreva non era ancora calda. Su richiesta (non proposto da loro) mi è stato esteso il check out di qualche ora. Ma il problema dell’acqua calda “in ritardo” non è comunque stato risolto, e inoltre non sono stato avvertito che la chiave della camera sarebbe comunque scaduta all’ora del normale check-in, quindi sono dovuto scendere per farla cambiare. 
Inoltre la pulizia era scarsissima, solo l’ultimo giorno mi sono accorto che vicino al comodino dalla parte del letto in cui non ho dormito c’era polvere accumulata di settimane, e... un’unghia del piede tagliata, non certo mia!!! 
Cose inaccettabili per qualunque hotel, ma soprattutto per uno di questo livello.",1,2020,01,22

01,"Tanto fumo poco arrosto,","Weekend fantastico nella città eterna, ma questo hotel pur essendo dal punto di vista geografico, strategico, non è quello che mi aspettavo specialmente visti i prezzi.
Entrata e lobby non certo di livello, ascensori lenti camera con il sistema di condizionamento non buono e costretti a lasciare le finestre spalancate ( mi hanno detto che essendo all’ultimo piano fa caldo..... da non credere) inoltre non era vero visto che l’ultimo è il ristorante in terrazza. Il frigorifero non funzionava e dopo diverse lamentele mi hanno detto che il personale delle pulizie aveva staccato ed invertito le spine.... da non credere. Stanza normale tv piccola e vecchia vasca con doccia, ma nellinsieme di dimensioni giuste.
La Colazione con prezzi assurdi, è molto scadente ed assolutamente non di livello, aranciata cattiva , brioches non di pasticceria uova strapazzate fredde. 
La vista è la posizione salvano questo hotel, insieme alla cordialità e simpatia del personale .",3,2019,12,01
01,Bene ma non benissimo,L'hotel è in posizione centrale quindi molto strategico ma non dimostra le 5 stelle assegnate. Sia per il menu e sia per alcune tipologie di stanze non proprio di lusso. Ho trovato però gentilezza e cortesia da parte di tutto lo staff e in particolar modo Chiara della reception che si è distinta per la sua gentilezza e disponibilità.,3,2019,11,26
01,Bella Roma,"Wir waren 3 Tage in Rom und wir kommen bestimmt wieder !
Die Bewertungen über dieses Hotel haben uns erschreckt und wir können diese Bewertungen nicht teilen. 
Man sollte wissen das in Italien ein anderer Standard ist.
Unser Zimmer war gross , hell,sauber 
Es wurde sehr darauf geachtet das es uns gut geht. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. 
Das Frühstück war Absolut ausreichend. 
3 verschiedene Eierspeisen,Würstchen,
Waffeln, Kuchen, Croissants,Nutella 
Marmelade, 5 verschiedene Müsli,
Joghurt  frische Früchte, frisches rohes geschnittenes Gemüse,Wurst, Ricotta,Mozzarella usw,Glutenfrei kein Problem
Also bitte was braucht man mehr.
Was frühstücken die Menschen Zuhause die solche schlechte Bewertungen abgeben.
Das gesamte Personal sehr freundlich
Alles in allem top
Mein Tip an alle Bewertungsschreiber
Immer menschlich bleiben und objektiv bewerten.
Schlechte Bewertungen sind schnell geschrieben aber für den oder das Bewertende hat das oft Folgen und diese können sich nicht dagegen wehren.
Also immer nach der Landeskategorie bewerten in jedem Land gibt es andere Lebensgewohnheiten.",5,2019,11,08
01,Hotel nur in guter Lage,Das Hotel hat eine super Lage. Ansonsten ist es weit entfernt von einem 5 Sterne Hotel. Die Zimmer sind sehr dunkel und die Sauberkeit ist gerade noch okay. Frühstück ist eine Katastrophe. Die Qualität des Essens ist miserabel. Das Hotel können wir nicht empfehlen. Dafür ist es einfach zu teuer!,2,2019,10,06
01,Attenti alla camera assegnata,"Ospite di un’azienda per un evento ho avuto la sfortuna di essere alloggiato in una camera indegna di un hotel che mostra all’ingresso 5 stelle lusso 
Essendo ospite non ho ritenuto opportuno lamentarmi alla reception ma credo francamente che alcune stanze non ancora ristrutturate non dovrebbero più assegnarle 
A parte la vista sul cantiere della casa di fianco... non tutte le stanze possono affacciare sulla bella piazza aulica la conservazione della stanza n 101 è veramente imbarazzante 
Per il resto nulla da dire sul meraviglioso terrazzo con vista panoramica, cena e colazione di buon livello personale gentile e disponibile 
Peccato ",3,2019,09,17
01,Leider mangelhaft,"Weder hat das Hotel 5 Sterne verdient, noch ist der Preis gerechtfertigt:
- Die Zimmer sind abgewohnt und nicht richtig sauber
- Fenster nicht schalldicht, Gefühl auf der Straße zu schlafen 
- warmes Wasser nach 10 Minuten 
- Frühstück ist eine Frechheit (z.B. Rührei flüssig und kalt)
- Bügeleisen konnte zwei mal nicht gebracht werden, da es angeblich im ganzen Haus nur eines gibt

Positiv:
- Lage
- Teilweise freundliches Personal 

Finger weg!

01,Excelente lugar para quedarse y volver.,"La primera vez que vine fue hace 19 años con mis padres, volví dos años después y por ultima vez ahora.
Es un sitio maravilloso, en un lugar inmejorable, cerca de todo y con transporte a escasos metros del hotel.
En una de las mejores zonas de Roma, suficientemente despoblada del exceso de turistas que supone irse a una zona más céntrica (sin este estar demasiado alejado) tiendas cercanas de categoría, barrio tranquilo... poco más se puede decir.
Del servicio, no me encuentro palabras que hagan justicia al exquisito trato y atención que ponen.
El precio en puede parecer en la línea, pero una vez que uno entra en la habitación, totalmente remodelada, parece hasta regalado.
100% recomendable.
Nota: tiene un pequeño bar en la azotea con unas vistas impresionantes y en el que espero coincidir con cualquiera que se fíe de esta recomendación mia.",5,2019,04,18

Peccato non ci sia un bollitore per un the.
Ormai anche nei 3 stelle lo trovo.
Acqua in bottiglietta offerta solo al primo pernottamento, ho ritrovato la bottiglietta che avevo lasciato
sul comodino.. offrirne una seconda era troppo?
Pranzo a buffet per un evento povero e di scarsa qualità. Il personale di sala era esclusivamente (coffee break e pranzo) stage,che poveri erano buttati la senza sapere cosa dire e fare.
Mi hanno versato dell'acqua calda per il te della medesima quantità di un caffé ristretto. Ho fatto da me poi.
Poca attenzione ai dettagli.
Carta igienica terminata nelle toilette per una buona mezz'ora.
Insomma. Totalmente delusa. I 5 stelle Lusso sono ben altro!

Alessandra  nos dijo que se habían acabado. El colmo!!! Además de que nadie nos habló ni una sola palabra en español. Nos transmitió sus disculpas y nos pidió una segunda oportunidad para la próxima  vez que nos alojáramos en el hotel.

Ero uno dei partecipanti al MIA MARKET, Mercato Internazionale Audiovisivo e quindi, c'era una particolare intensità di richieste e necessità ma il personal e lo STAFF in generale, sono stati sempre cortesi e disponibili. Una qualità questa molto importante quando hai una serie di meeting che hanno bisogno della massima flessibilità. Segnale in particolare il cameriere Robert, un inglese sposato con una donna siciliana e che lavora lì da circa 22 anni, Un grandissimo professionista!

Ci propongono un aperitivo che accettiamo volentieri, ovviamente a pagamento: rimango senza parole!!! Prosecco caldo e di pessima qualità, gli stuzzichini erano costituiti da patatine fritte aperte da almeno due settimane, noccioline quasi rancide e salatini, sono rimasta senza parole, cose assolutamente scadenti ed inaccettabili per un albergo a 5 stelle, non credo ci tornerò mai più!:",1,2018,09,13

La posizione dell’hotel è perfetta in pieno centro storico e permette di visitare molti monumenti con una breve passeggiata, inoltre la fermata “Barberini” della metropolitana è a 20 metri dall’hotel. Il personale è stato gentile, la nostra camera era “modesta” considerando che è un hotel a 5 stelle, tuttavia era pulita, silenziosa e confortevole. 
Non abbiamo fatto colazione nell’albergo quindi non posso giudicare il servizio. All’ultimo piano c’è una grande terrazza da cui poter ammirare tutta Roma, vale la pena fermarsi un po’ e lasciarsi incantare dalla “grande bellezza” della città eterna... magari sorseggiando un cocktail al tramonto.

Das Zimmer war hell und bequem. Das Frühstück war sehr gut und auf internationale Gäste ausgerichtet mit sehr aufmerksamen Personal. Leider gab es ein Problem: der Roomservice. Die benutzten Gläser wurden nicht ausgetauscht, man müsste anrufen, um neue zu bekommen. Die Sauberkeit des Badezimmers war ebenso mangelhaft; es wurde täglich geputzt, man war aber nicht in der Lage jedes Haar zu beseitigen. Der größte Fehler war ein weißes T-Shirt auf dem Kleiderschrank zu legen.  Danach war der Schrank nicht mehr  so staubig und das T-Shirt konnte ich nicht mehr anziehen.  Für ein Fünf-Sternen Hotel dieser Preiskategorie sehr peinlich. Noch eine kurze Bemerkung zur möglichen Frage, warum habe ich mich nicht bei der Reception beschwert: ich sehe es nicht als die Aufgabe des Gastes ein Hotel auf etwas selbstverständliches hinzuweisen.

Die Zimmer sind klassisch und gut eingerichtet. 
Das Frühstück ist reichhaltig und lecker.

Aber der Roomservice ist für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie schwach. Es ist im großen und ganzen sauber und doch findet man Staub in den Schränken und Haare im Bidet.

01,Vivere di rendita sulle glorie del passato ,"Forse una volta il Bernini Bristol era una icona del lusso nella città eterna, ma oggi l’unica cosa rimasta a testimonianza di ciò è la targa che riporta la classificazione di 5 stelle Lusso all’entrata dell’hotel. Soggiorno abitualmente in alberghi a 5 stelle per i miei viaggi di lavoro e di svago per cui ritengo di aver accumulato una discreta e quanto mai significativa casistica che mi permette di poter effettuare una valutazione obiettiva delle strutture in cui alloggio e, mio malgrado, devo esprimere un giudizio alquanto negativo nei confronti del Bernini Bristol. Come ho già sottolineato in altre mie recensioni, premetto che la valutazione di una struttura alberghiera deve sempre essere rapportata alla classificazione e non deve rappresentare un giudizio in termini assoluti. Iniziamo dal ricevimento, dove dopo le consuete formalità di check-in e l’assegnazione della stanza, ci rechiamo in stanza e......scopriamo che è già occupata da altri ospiti: IMPERDONABILE! Ritorniamo alla reception e, con tante scuse, ci viene riassegnata una nuova stanza. Saliamo al piano e, dopo alcuni inutili tentativi di accedere alla stanza, realizziamo che le chiavi magnetiche non erano abilitate. Finalmente dopo un’altro giro in reception, e con evidente imbarazzo da parte degli addetti, ci vengono abilitate le chiavi e possiamo prendere possesso della stanza. Appena entrati notiamo che l’impianto di aria condizionata è parecchio rumoroso, per cui provvediamo subito allo spegnimento dal termostato in stanza, ma pur risultando spento, la rumorosità proveniente dal condotto rimane fastidiosamente elevata. Segnaliamo la cosa e, dopo l’intervento del tecnico di manutenzione, viene drasticamente risolta con lo spegnimento dell’impianto a monte del termostato, rendendo quindi l’aerazione in stanza indisponibile: d’altronde ci troviamo solo in un 5 stelle Lusso! La chicca però ci attende al nostro rientro in stanza dopo cena quando, a seguito del rassetto serale, troviamo il bagno pieno di capelli, indubbiamente non nostri, sul pavimento e nel lavabo.....Totalmente Inaccettabile!!! Abbiamo prontamente documentato con foto lo stato del bagno e segnalato il tutto alla reception che, con l’ennesima dimostrazione di imbarazzo, ha provveduto a rimediare con un secondo passaggio da parte dell’house keeping. Errori o sviste possono capitare, ma una sequenza di superficialità come quelle a noi capitate in un hotel di questa categoria proprio no. Non ci sono scuse o ragioni che possano giustificare una tale approssimazione in un contesto dove l’eccellenza dovrebbe fare la differenza.",2,2018,05,01

01,"Mejorable, situación y personal impecable. Sería un 4 **** en España","Semana Santa, después de 10 años repetimos en éste hotel su ubicación es increíble para desplazarte, el metro a 20 metros y el bus lo mismo, varios sitios de interés como la fuente de Trevi y la plaza Spagna  todos a menos de 5 a 10 minutos andando. El servicio del personal del hotel es impecable siempre atento, tanto en recepción, en el desayuno (hace 10 años el buffet era mucho mejor) y limpieza. La habitación 416 amplia pero el armario escaso, el baño aceptable, un poco ruidosa, el ascensor al lado, el wi-fi fallaba cada dos por tres (en el check-out  lo comuniqué en recepción), las vistas a una calle, la estancia fue agradable. Espero volver y no me toque esa habitación o alguna parecida.",4,2018,04,03
01,No es un cinco estrellas,"Nos decepcionó.  Aunque las instalaciones son correctas y la ubicación muy buena, no es un hotel de cinco estrellas. El servicio de limpieza es mejorable (en 4 días no limpiaron la bañera ni repusieron geles en uno de los cuartos de nuestro grupo), hay cisternas estropeadas y puertas correderas del baño que no cierran correctamente.  El desayuno es escaso en variedad. El metro en la misma plaza es, sin embargo, un elemento positivo.

01,NON ALL’ALTEZZA ,Bella posizione e bel affaccio su piazza Barberini. Camere vecchio stile. Oneste ma certamente non all’altezza di un 5 stelle. Colazione varia ma poco curata con personale poco attento. Manca una vera attenzione al cliente purtroppo tipica di hotel con continuo ricambio di turisti. ,3,2018,03,17
01,posizione ottima,"la camera era ottima , il servizio efficiente, la prima colazione ottima , unico rilievo riguarda i quotidiani a disposizione : il Corriere ed il Messaggero come tutti i giornali danno informazioni di parte; perchè mancano i quotidiani come il MANIFESTO o IL FATTO QUOTIDIANO, anche questi ovviamente di parte , ma che, come tali consentirebbero di avere una informazione più plurale?",5,2018,02,24
01,Bello ed efficiente,"Sono stato in questo Hotel tre volte, sempre per convegni giuridici. Non ho quindi ""testato"" il servizio di pernottamento ma tutto il resto. L'ambiente è molto raffinato, i convegni si svolgono in sale adeguatamente attrezzate e confortevoli. Il ristorante è di livello: cucina a vista nella sala interna, dotata di pareti vetrate con vista mozzafiato del centro di Roma. Personale preparato e gentile.",4,2018,01,30
01,L'ombelico del mondo,Piazza Barberini è proprio l'ombelico del mondo; la posizione di questo hotel è veramente straordinaria. Camere e servizi sono adeguati al rango ma forse il rapporto qualità prezzo non è il massimo dell'equilibrio. La hall è il posto ideale per gli appuntamenti di lavoro.,4,2018,01,27

01,"Delusione, l’unica cosa che merita è la posizione.","Ho passato due notti in questo Hotel in onore del capodanno, ho prenotato qualche minuto prima del mio arrivo per esigenze personali.
Appena arrivati veniamo accolti abbastanza bene tranne per l’affermazione fatta da una signora del personale durante il check-in ovvero: ma avete 18 anni? Cosa che mi ha lasciato abbastanza stranito.
Le valige (5stelle) ho dovuto portarle in camera io, nessuno mi ha accompagnato alla camera mi hanno detto il piano ed ho dovuto cercarla, i letti erano staccati e con delle ruote sotto e per questo ho dormito staccato dalla mia fidanzata! 
Spa(se così si può chiamare) orribile, cade quasi a pezzi vasca idromassaggio sporca con una sostanza strana nera attaccata ai lati.
Ma la sorpresa me la sono trovata alla fine quando dopo aver pagato 49€ di parcheggio (A NOTTE) vedo la mia macchina arrivare tutta lanciata e prima dell’hotel tirare una gran accelerata.. io dico dopo che ti pago tienila bene e portamela indietro con calma e attenzione non come se fosse tua.
SCONSIGLIO VIVAMENTE A TUTTI a quei prezzi si trova sicuramente di meglio, metto due stelle solo per la POSIZIONE.",2,2018,01,03
01,"Accordi non rispettati, camere decadenti.","Settembre 2017: dopo mesi di trattative, visita in marzo all'albergo con scelta delle camere una per una, tutte da poco rifatte, pagamento pieno secondo i loro canoni, nonostante fossimo un gruppo di 19 amici (avremmo potuto chiedere un trattamento-gruppo, ma tenevamo alla qualità delle camere e non lo abbiamo fatto, quindi eravamo 19 individuali), arriviamo in albergo e solo una o due camere erano quelle che avevo visto, su dieci: ci hanno dato camere non concordate e assolutamente vecchie e buie, con lampadine a pochissime candele, una pena... Quando dico ""vecchie"" intendo almeno degli anni '60-'70, apparentemente mai ripulite. Stanze vecchie e buie, pareti scrostate e macchiate, armadi scricchiolanti, pulizia giornaliera assolutamente scarsa: uno scandalo rapportato ai prezzi esorbitanti (euro 380 al giorno per la doppia, euro 320 al giorno per la singola- disposti a spenderli senza discutere per quello che avevo visto), alle stelle che ha e alle pretese. Ho scoperto, visitandolo prima dell'arrivo, che hanno proprio due tipologie di camere: ti fanno vedere quelle belle, rifatte da poco,  te le promettono e te le fanno pagare, poi ti danno la fregatura. Il personale al ricevimento ha detto, dopo la prima notte, se volevamo cambiare: vecchia tattica: su tre notti, dopo aver disfatto le valige, ti adatti, rassegnato, e non hai sempre voglia per due notti residue di cambiare. Resta l'indignazione. In Italia riusciamo sempre a fare brutte figure con il turismo... anche a cinque stelle... Unica  nota positiva la sala colazioni: cibo eccellente, personale, a seconda del (loro) umore, discreto. Comunque è un MAI PIU'.",2,2018,01,02

01,Sotto le aspettative ,"Soggiorno per lavoro spesso in questo tipo di hotel, 5 stelle lusso significa fare la differenza a mio avviso anche sui dettagli, per questo hotel purtroppo ho apprezzato solo la splendida posizione centrale, il resto una delusione. 
Con ordine: camera molto old style con tanta tappezzeria, bagno anonimo con vasca, ristorazione poco curata, colazione da medio 4 stelle con poca varietà fresca, personale gentile ma poco professionale. Hotel che potrebbe avere un certo fascino per gli amanti del genere, ma molto al di sotto di un vero 5 stelle, le foto possono essere testimonianza. ",3,2017,12,13
01,Soggiorno perfetto !!!,"La nostra camera era spaziosa e piena di luce, posizione centralissima dell'hotel, servizio eccellente, massima cortesia e disponibilità di tutto il personale.

Ottimi cocktail.personale gentilissimo e un atmosfera unica
Lo consiglio vivamente a tutti coloro che vogliono rilassarsi in uno dei piu' nei roof di Roma.
Mando spesso clienti ad alloggiare che mi confermano la meravigliosità di questo albergo in fatto di sonno...colazione...trattamento in camera...
Lo consiglio quindi per coloro che cercano una sistemazione di lusso in pieno centro a Roma.",5,2017,11,11
01,Una Visita Inusual,"El día sábado 14 de Octubre por la noche, fuimos al hotel a tomar un aperitivo en la terraza. En la puerta del hotel nos recibieron muy amablemente, al igual que el metre quien nos brindó una recepción excelente.

01,Schlechtestes Hotel seid langem!,"Das Hotel is maximal zwei Sterne wert! Bei Anreise war das Zimmer stark verschmutzt mit Schimmel und Staub, so dass wir es nochmal reinigen haben lassen. Am darauffolgenden Tag sind wir in ein anderes Zimmer umgezogen, jedoch war dies nicht viel besser seitens der Sauberkeit. Bei der Badezimmer Türe löste such die Furnier ab und die Hellhörigkeit im Hotel lies uns mindestens drei bis fünfmal munter werden während der Nacht. 
Uns wurde wegen unserer Beschwerde kostenlos Frühstück angeboten und ein Drink an der Rooftop Bar beides kann ich jedoch nicht empfehlen. Die Qualität und das Angebot der Speisen insbesondere der Eier lässt zu wünschen übrig und entspricht an unserem Standard gemessen maximal einem zwei bis drei Stern. Das Service an der Rooftop Bar ist derart unhöflich so dass man sicher kein zweites Mal hingeht. Der Zugang zum Wellnessbereich entspricht einer Baustelle und die einzelnen Einrichtungen wie Dampfbad oder Sauna sind sehr unhygienisch so dass ich nach kürzester Zeit meinen Besuch abbrach. 

Der Preis ist völlig überzogen und absolut nicht gerechtfertigt! Einmal und nie wieder!",1,2017,11,04

Magari mi sono semplicemente imbattuto in una giornata NO.",3,2017,06,25
01,Cómodo ,"Fue un hotel cómodo pero hasta ahí. Pedí ayuda con 15 días de anticipación para acortar una noche y no me ayudaron, me la cobraron igual. No nos dieron el upgrade que nos había prometido.

01,Una mattinata di relax! ,"Dopo aver prenotato un percorso Spa per due persone ci siamo addentrati in questo bellissimo hotel al centro di Piazza Barberini, a due passi dalla stazione della metro. Non abbiamo visto molto dell'hotel ma già la hall con la zona bar ci è bastata per capire l'eleganza e il lusso della struttura. Al piano inferiore alla hall c'è la palestra e la zona spa. La ragazza al desk è stata molto gentile e disponibile, ci ha spiegato in cosa consisteva il percorso e abbiamo iniziato la mattinata di relax! Il percorso consiste in mezz'ora a testa di massaggio e in due ore tra sauna e bagno turco, la zona relax e tisaneria, e la vasca jacuzzi che però al momento non era disponibile per cui ci hanno fatto una gold card per poterne usufruire nei prossimi sei mesi. Inoltre ti forniscono ciabatte, asciugamani, shampoo e bagnoschiuma. Sicuramente ci ritorneremo però usufruire della card ma anche per rilassarci di nuovo un una struttura bellissima che nonostante si trovi al centro di Roma ci ha fatto completamente dimenticato lo stress e il caos esterno.

01,La tradizione,"Ho soggiornato al Bernini per 3 notti in occasione delle repliche romane di un mio spettacolo alle quali faceva compagnia l'influenza (con molteplici virus) dell'anno.

Non  ero mai stato in questo albergo come del resto in altri di Roma che mi vede tra i suoi cittadini. 

Cominciamo col dire che non amo gli alberghi moderni e di un lusso che spesso equivale a poca eleganza e discrezione.  

Il Bernini è rimasto (credo) ancorato alla sua tradizione.  Camere ben fatte ma low profile con tutto quello che serve (e di più) ma con attenta scelta alla non ostentazione.

Il personale è perfetto. Gentilezza ed educazione sono all'ordine del giorno - immagino -
dato che dal loro modo di ospitare traspariva sincerità e abitudine a voler far sentire il cliente a proprio agio.  

Frequento la Sina Hotel in altre città (ottimo è il De La Ville a Milano) e ho trovato le stesse caratteristiche di cordialità e (evviva) poca supponenza.

Ringrazio sentitamente... è stata una bella e piacevole scoperta... malgrado i virus che avevano fatto scempio del sottoscritto.

A presto!",5,2017,02,23
01,Muy buen hotel,"Todo muy limpio, buen restaurante, gran localización muy céntrico. El restaurante en el piso 7 Excelente y el roof top en el 8. Recomendado. Acceso al metro a pocos pasos de la salida del hotel muy ventajoso para transportarse por la ciudad. ",4,2017,02,09
01,Centrale e si sta bene...ma,"L hotel è sicuramente accogliente e sito in una zona molto comoda al centro.
Le camere sono carine e accoglienti, il letto molto comodo e i bagni di media dimensione.
L unica cosa che mi viene da dire è che non ho trovato differenza tra un 4 stelle qualunque  e questo 5 stelle Luxury.
Probabilmente avessi dovuto pagare 600 euro per una camera avrei dato una recensione peggiore ma visto che ero per lavoro....
Il personale e comunque cordiale e gentile.
In sintesi...
Ho visto 5 stelle migliori.

01,Mai così in basso...,"È la prima volta che ci capita in modo eclatante di aver scoperto così negativamente un hotel a Roma che si fregia tra l'altro, di tante onorificenze. Già dalla hall ci rendiamo conto della vetustà presente, poi la camera ""suite"" prenotata è la conferma della decadenza e dello squallore. Tra l'altro, cosa ancora più fastidiosa, ubicata al primo piano con affaccio sulla piazza Barberini, rumorosissima grazie alla complicità di infissi stravecchi. Una tristezza infinita e...nottata in bianco...",1,2017,01,15
01,Albergo veramente ben fatto,"Ho girato parecchi hotel, ma questo fino ad adesso a Roma è veramente il top. Ho soggiornato in diverse camere e tutte spaziose. Camere insonorizzate, molto belle e ben pulite. Bagno spettacolare in alcune, unico neo il materasso che non in tutte le camere comodo (al piano primo molto scomodo) ; colazione da migliorare in quanto non all'altezza dell'hotel.",5,2017,01,04
01,Top Lage,"Der Aufenthalt für 3 Nächte hat uns von diesem Hotel überzeugt.

Der altitalienische Flair den dieses alte Gemäuer vermittelt, hat unmittelbar nach Ankunft ein Gefühl von dolce vita aufkommen lassen.

Der herzliche Empfang beim Check-In lies die Anstrengungen der Reise verblassen. Eine ausführliche und zu keinem Zeitpunkt unter Zeitdruck durchgeführte Erklärung der wichtigsten Sightseeingpunkte durch den anwesenden Manager hat uns einen guten Überblick verschafft.

Bezüglich Sauberkeit kann ich nur Gutes sprechen. Das Reinigungspersonal blieb für uns unsichtbar und kam seinen Aufgaben sichtbar nach.

Das Haus selbst befindet sich in einer Top Lage, von wo aus viele Sehenswürdigkeiten ohne Probleme fussläufig erreicht werden können. Bei Bedarf findet man jederzeit Taxis direkt am Eingang.
Der Ausblick von den oberen Etagen ist sagenhaft. Der direkte Blick bis zum Vatikan ist wunderschön.

Den Zugang zum Pool haben wir nach kurzer Suche abgebrochen. Eine bessere Beschilderung wäre hier wünschenswert.

Zum Restaurant kann ich leider keine Auskunft geben, da wir bei unseren Streifzügen durch Rom durchweg auswärts speisten.

Einziger Kritikpunkt war das Service beim Frühstück. Man muss sagen, dass eine größere Touristengruppe das Buffet leergefegt hat. Danach schien es so, als ob das Personal aufgegeben hatte. Für ein 5 Sterne Haus hat die Nachbestückung des Buffets sowie die Bereitstellung von Heißgetränken und dem Abräumen des schmutzigen Geschirrs viel zu lange gedauert. Bei Termindruck wäre ich verärgert gewesen.

Von mir gibt es eine Weiterempfehlung und ich selbst werde das Hotel sicher wieder besuchen. Das nächste Mal mit Restaurantbesuch!",5,2016,12,29
01,Vero lusso nel cuore di Roma,"Situato nel vero centro lussuoso di Roma ad inizio di Via Veneto con pieno affaccio imponente sul Piazza Barberini.
Sono stato invitato per una meravigliosa cena di riunione con tutta la famiglia e parenti ed ho avuto modo di vedere le incantevoli camere che sembrano tutte delle mini suite.
L'affaccio dai vari balconi sulla imponente piazza e la statua del Tritone suggestivamente illuminata da colori caldi dopo il tramonto è davvero incantevole.
L'aperitivo elegantissimo servito da personale estremamente cortese e professionale sulla terrazza all' ultimo piano è qualcosa di veramente suggestivo con un panorama mozzafiato.
La cena è stata veramente fine ed elegante in una atmosfera ovattata molto chic con piatti prelibati e serviti alla perfezione da personale molto attento.
Da romano e non da turista di certo non mi capita spesso di pernottare in alberghi della Capitale, ma di certo per un evento speciale non mancherà l'occasione di passare un incantevole weekend romantico con la mia compagna.",5,2016,12,26
01,Molto bello,"Situato in una posizione centralissima di Roma, potrete godervi uno scorcio stupendo sia dalla camera (se situata sulla facciata principale) che dal ristorante.

Sapendo che l'ora del nostro treno il mattino dopo era alle ore 7:45, abbiamo chiesto al guichet dell'albergo a che ora iniziava la colazione, ci hanno risposto alle ore 7 precise. Non è stato cosi, abbiamo dovuto sollicitare l'apertura delle porte alle ore 7 e 5 minuti, e non era ancora pronta! A parte il fatto che, entrati, c'è stato uno sguardo seccato all'orologio. Aggiungo che il primo piatto che ho preso in mano era anche sporco! . La sera prima, vista l'ora, non abbiamo usato la doccia, peccato, perché la brutta sorpresa al mattino è stata che la doccia non funzionava! Nessuna possibilità per lavarci! Abbiamo comunicato il guasto al momento di pagare, e la risposta è stata che avremmo dovuto signalarlo prima! Viati i tempi a disposizione, non avrei potuto prendere il mio treno! Parole di scuse o di circostanza? Nessuna.",1,2016,11,18
01,Buena ubicación aunque caro y con pocas atenciones,"Pasamos allí 3 días para el cumpleaños de un amigo, y me llevé una gran decepción. Nada más llegar, nadie nos abrió la puerta de entrada al hotel ni nos subieron las maletas, en un hotel de esa categoría es lo menos que podíamos esperar.
La habitación era realmente pequeña, no había sitio donde abrir la maleta y para pasar por los pies de la cama tenía que ser de lado para no darte con la tele.
Había oído buenos comentarios de este hotel y así lo esperaba, quizás por eso mi decepción fue mayor. El desayuno muy normalizó y el personal no resulta especialmente agradable. El baño, en la línea de la habitación también muy pequeño no caben 2 personas a la vez, y la ducha apenas si tiene presión, es una pena porque la ubicación es buena, apenas 800m de la plaza de España, pero no repetiremos desde luego.",3,2016,11,17

01,Party in suite ,Per una presentazione abbiamo organizzato un evento nella suite al 6 piano. La camera di 70 mq è bella ma ciò che vale veramente tanto è la terrazza con vista su Roma. C'è una piscina con acqua riscaldata..piccola palestra..insomma non manca niente. ,4,2016,10,23

01,Splendida serata!,Era la prima volta nella nuova location del Giuda Ballerino! Devo dire che la splendida vista che si ha dalla terrazza dell'Hotel Barberini è degna della cucina dello chef Andrea Fusco che ogni volta sorprende e delizia il palato con le sue creazioni! Personale professionale e attento ma allo stesso tempo discreto. Il locale è ancora un po' freddo forse a causa del recente trasferimento dalla storica sede di Largo Appio Claudio. Da non perdere il menù degustazione: più che una cena un'esperienza! ,5,2016,09,19
01,"Lindo hotel, ideal ubicación!","Estuvimos alojados en este hotel con mi esposo a finales de Agosto 2016. La ubicación es excepcional, la ideal diría yo.

Esmerados al máximo porque uno se sienta cómodo.

01,mmmmmmmm,"Per essere un 5* lusso non mi sento di suggerire questo hotel.
La camera può essere associata a un hotel 4 stelle (massimo) inoltre i muri sono sottilissimi e si sente tutto...e di notte non è assolutamente piacevole.
Colazione...migliorabile assolutamente! Mancavano le basi: come una varietà di marmellate oppure fette biscottate...Misera misera
Ho richiesto un caffè al ginseg e mi hanno fatto pagare l'extra!
Buona la posizione.
Buono il servizio.",3,2016,07,30
01,Un clasico,"Excelente ubicación con muy buenas vistas. La atención de su personal es excelente pero los servicios no incluidos (comidas, servicio habitaciones, ...) son excesivamente caros.

01,Può capitare ?,"Stavolta è andata maluccio. Confinata alla fine del piano dove è in corso attività di manutenzione, rientro in albergo e trovo anticamera chiusa: può capitare.  Ore 5 scatta un allarme che si sblocca alle 8: può capitare. Cerco di chiudere la famosa anticamera e mi ritrovo un manutentore che dipinge il corridoio con relativo odore di vernice : può capitare. La domanda da porsi è : al Bernini????? Andrà meglio la prossima volta.  ",1,2016,06,25

01,"Super Lage, schöne Immobilie","Ich war vom 1.06.2016 bis zum 05. 06 2016 in diesem Hotel untergebracht( zu Gast gesesen wäre ein falsches Wort,  für das was ich erlebt habe) . Aufgrund von Problemen mit Eurowings erreicht ich das Hotel erst gegen 22:15. Die Rezeptionistin war so nett und vermittelte mir noch einen Tisch im Restaurant im 8. OG,  angeblich unter der Leitung eines ehemaligen Sternekochs. Der Empfang gegen 22:30 Uhr im Restaurant verlief schon sehr frostig,  scheinbar fühlte man sich im baldigen Feierabend gestört. 
Da es spät war wollte ich kein ganzes Menü essen,  sondern  bestellte einen Hauptgang vom iberischen Schwein. Nach kurzer Diskussion mit dem Kellner entschied ich mich gegen den angebotenen und vom Kellner favorisierten offenen Valpolicella und bestellte vom ebenfalls angebotenen offenen Cabernet ein Glas. Dazu eine grosse Flasche Wasser. Das Wasser kam recht bald,  der Wein ließ auf sich warten,  auf Nachfrage kam dann eine Bedienung und versuchte den Valpolicella einzuschenkenken,  was ich verhinderte. Danach wieder lange Ruhe,  dann kam eine Dame,  die sich als Sommelier vorstellte, ich erklärte erneut mein Anliegen und nach einiger Zeit bekam ich ein Glas von dem gewünschten Wein.  Zwischenzeitlich waren 6 ( in Worten sechs) kleine Scheiben trockenen Brotes gebracht worden.  Dann kam auch der Hauptgang:Zwei kleine zähe Stü ke mit Sehnen, die wohl vorher am Stück zubereitet worden waren,  wobei der dünnere Teil des Ausgangsstückes zu weit durchgebraten und somit trocken war,  der dickere Teil war,  was den Gargrad anbelangt, essbar, aber von schlechter Fleischqualität. Die beiden Stücke wurden auf einer wohl schon mittags auf den Teller aufgestrichenen eingetrockneten graubraunen Creme serviert garniert mit ein paar welken grünen Blättern. Das Brot stellte sich als gut abgelagert heraus,  wobei eine Scheibe erkennbar und fühlbar das einseitig eingetrocknete Kopfstück war.  Der Kellner,  hierauf angesprochen, meinte, da könne man um diese Zeit, ca.  23:00 Uhr,  nicht mehr erwarten. Für diese Leistung entrichtete ich, wohl wegen der guten Aussicht,  62,00 €. 
Beim Frühstück gibt es gerne schon mal kalte Spiegeleier,  weil die Warmhaltetechnik versagt,  Hinweise hierauf werden nicht zur Kenntnis genommen,  einmal wurde mein Platz abgeräumt,  während ich mir noch etwas zum Essen holte. Auf den Rückenlehnen der Stühle ruht der Staub der Jahrhunderte und das Brot ist sicher vom Vortag. 
Einzig die Rezeption bemüht sich redlich als Gastgeber aufzutreten. 
Die von mir erlebten Ergebnisse der Küche lassen vermuten,  das hier niemand je eine Sterneküche von innen gesehen hat,  geschweige dort gearbeitet hat.",2,2016,06,05
01,Questa volta non ci siamo,"Ho utilizzato questo hotel diverse volte nel corso degli anni ma l'ultima esperienza è stata proprio deludente e non all'altezza dello status di questo tipo di alberghi. La camera era decisamente vetusta, pavimento del bagno rifatto con la resina, piastrelle di marmo stuccate in qualche modo , tende della camera impossibili da regolare. Camera non preparata per la notte. Se aggiungiamo che non ci è stato possibile prendere un aperitivo nel bar della hall ( quello sul ROOF era riservato ad un evento esclusivo) perché non c'era il personale abbiamo completato il quadro.",2,2016,06,04
01,ECCELLENZA PURA,"Niente da dire.............
Pecca il parcheggio e un po' di fretta della reception.

01,E sopra il tetto una terrazza mozzafiato,"Questo Albergo di lusso che si affaccia maestoso su piazza Barberini, con la grande facciata moderna che si confronta con le linee antiche del grande palazzo dei Barberini, ha interni arredati lussuosamente con pezzi di antiquariato e saloni con marmi e cristalli segno di una opulenza che una volta era di moda nei locali di rappresentanza dei grandi alberghi.
Ma la cosa più bella di questo bell'albergo e' la sua terrazza dove un gradevole ristorante in parte coperto con una zona a vetrate e in parte aperto si affaccia sulla bellezza di Roma, i giardini del Quirinale, le cupole barocche sino a San Pietro e poi Terinita' dei Monti. Non male neanche la cucina ed il garbato servizio, che di sera lascia spazio alle delizie di un cuoco ""stellato"".",4,2016,05,20
01,SOGNO,"Fantastico tutto perfetto, stanze perfette, cibo bevande tutto. Il migliori hotel in cui sono mai stata. Stupendo. Costoso ma ne vale la pena davvero. In una zona di Roma comoda e moltoooo bella. Miglior hotel. Accoglienza ottima e soggiorno stupendo",5,2016,05,02
01,excelente ubicacion y estilo,"este hotel sigue siendo como hace 30 años que fui excelente con un conserje de lujo
gran desayuno agiornado y con el estilo
unico defecto que le agregaron sus nuevos dueños fuel de perfumar de manera excesiva las habitaciones antiguas reconocido por sus empleados
tuvieron que cambiarme de habitacion
los grandes hoteles del mundo jamas colocan ese tipo de perfume en las habitaciones
deberian tener en cuenta que hay gente que no le gusta o alergica total para perfumar a pedido siempre hay tiempo",4,2016,04,14
01,Keine 5 Sterne,"Sehr altes Hotel, das merkt man leider auch in den Zimmern. 
Es hat bei unseren Urlaub nichts gepasst. Wir mussten jeden Tag was bemängeln. Raucherzimmer, Fön defekt, Fugen sehr ekelig, Vorhang geht nicht zu.
Preise im Restaurant und in der Bar extrem überteuert.
Die tolle Aussicht kann man nur bei einem teuren Restaurantbesuch sehen..",3,2016,04,08
01,Es bueno para 4 estrellas,"El hotel es bueno,  su ubicación es increíble para mis citas de negocios.  Sales estas en la plaza bernini frente a la fuente de tritón,  el metro a una cuadra al igual que varios sitios de interés como fuente de trevi y plaza spagna todos a menos de 5 a 10 minutos caminando.  El servicio del personal del hotel es muy bueno el personal siempre atento, Blas habitaciones amplias y en la noche su restaurante en la azotea es muy bueno por las vistas.  Pero el hotel necesita ciertos detalles y ya es hora de un mantenimiento.  Pero es buen hotel y la pase muy bien",4,2016,04,06
01,Klassiker in bester Lage,Das Bernini Bristol ist ein Hotel in Roms bester Lage und vor allem mit einer tollen Aussicht .... Die Dachterrasse ist wirklich unschlagbar. Zimmer und Service sind etwas altbacken aber eben klassisch. Treppenhaus war teilweise eine Baustelle aber das bleibt wohl nicht aus.,4,2016,03,19
01,FACCIATA RISTRUTTURATA....,"ASPETTI POSITIVI = Ottima posizione; bella hall; personale cortese sebbene non affettato; corridoi ai piani ben manutenuti; letto comodo con biancheria di livello.
ASPETTI NEGATIVI = Camera datata, con manutenzione non efficiente: pareti scrostate (dietro le tende e nelle zone che si spera non vengano viste); bagno in marmo con incrostazioni, rubinetteria da cambiare e che perde acqua (riparazione effettuata dopo ben due segnalazioni), sanitari vecchi e tristi; scale vergognose: i primi due piani sono praticamente di servizio, piuttosto sporchi e squallidi, senza passatoia, con casse e altri oggetti ammassati in bella vista. I piani successivi hanno una moquette rovinata e sporca, veramente triste (e le norme di sicurezza, quelle saranno rispettate?); durante la prima colazione avere una tazza di the è un'impresa titanica per il ritardo con cui ti chiedono cosa desideri e con cui poi te lo portano (ma perchè non dare, come per il caffè, la possibilità di servirsi da soli al buffet?).
Insomma, non è un cinque stelle (o forse può dirsi tale giusto perchè in bagno ci sono lo specchio ingranditore o i kleenex?). Da un albergo di questa categoria mi aspetto manutenzione perfetta e servizio impeccabile. Temo purtroppo che questo sia un vizio molto italiano, particolarmente in alcune città d'arte: il turista qui ci viene comunque, perchè sprecare denaro ed energie per dare il meglio anche nella sostanza e non solo nell'apparenza?",3,2016,03,01
01,"Un 5 stelle deve esser perfetto, senza ombre!","Non si può parlare male di questo hotel, molto bello, in posizione centrale e buona per raggiungere altre zone turistiche di Roma, ma secondo me un albergo a 5 stelle, con una prestigiosa storia, non può avere ombre, soprattutto quando una stanza doppia costa più di 250 euro a notte.
Nel mio caso specifico, ho trascorso due giorni in questo albergo durante i quali, tralasciando i diversi aspetti positivi che non mancano, ho notato alcune mancanze che qui elenco: prenotata camera matrimoniale e ho trovato due letti singoli (rapidamente trasformati in matrimoniale); stanza ampia e pulita, ma con scarsa illuminazione e zona armadio letteralmente in ombra al punto di dover accendere la luce del bagno per poterci vedere dentro (come ci hanno suggerito le stesse cameriere; porta del bagno mal curata; segnale televisivo scadente; posizione scomoda del bidet; rete wi-fi di dubbia efficienza. Altro aspetto criticabile è l'insufficienza degli ascensori che costringe a lunghe attese, tenendo anche conto che non esiste una vera e propria scala per gli ospiti, ma una scala che viene prevalentemente utilizzata dagli inservienti. In ultimo, la sala colazione che è insufficiente ad accogliere tutti gli ospiti i quali, a volte, sono costretti ad attendere il proprio turno, e il personale (forse insufficiente) che non riesce a soddisfare le richieste in tempi adeguati.
Insomma, un hotel a 5 stelle con qualche ombra: peccato!",4,2016,02,29
01,"Sale attrezzate, personale disponbile e splendida vista","Esperienza mattutina con brunch per un evento. Sale attrezzate e ben curate, anche il brunch è stato di livello e soprattutto con una vista spettacolare su piazza Barberini anche se da uno dei piani ""bassi"".

01,Super sicuro,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel un po' di tempo fa. La cosa che mi ha incuriosito , oltre alla bellezza dell'hotel stesso, la sicurezza e la sorveglianza, molto discreta. Avevo la camera che dava su Palazzo Barberini. Bellissima la terrazza , come il mezzanino con pitture datate, non riesco a ricondurmi al periodo. Gentilezza e cortesia del personale. Sono stato molto bene. Purtroppo ho dovuto troncare il periodo per ritornare urgentemente a Milano. Penso comunque che fra gli hotel sia uno dei migliori di Roma.",5,2015,12,31
01,Lusso e confort,"Situato nella splendida Piazza Barberini, costruita intorno alla fontana capolavoro del Bernini, l'hotel merita più delle sue quattro stelle. Hall accogliente e lussuosa, camere ampie e confortevoli, personale gentilissimo e disponibile, prima colazione abbondante e di qualità: questo è ciò che ho potuto apprezzare durante il mio soggiorno. Il punto in più: le vedute che si godono dalle stanze e dalla terrazza, dove c'è il ristorante ""Giuda Ballerino"", che merita una recensione a parte. Ottimo.",5,2015,12,23

La struttura offre quello che ci si aspetta da una ""vacanza romana"" lussuosa ed incantevole....locali pulitissimi, di pregio e funzionali; personale attento e disponibile, servizio garage per l'auto impeccabile e puntuale! Forse l'unico neo: la vista splendida sulla piazza è un pò penalizzante per via dei rumori notturni.

 Ovviamente,  strategica la posizione per visitare sia il centro cittadino nonché per usare la metropolitana (linea A).",5,2015,12,15
01,Scandaloso!!,"L'unica cosa che merita in questo hotel è la vista dalla terrazza panoramica. La stanza in cui ho soggiornato probabilmente risale agli anni '70: l'intonaco cade dal soffitto, il televisore non è degno neanche di una pensione a 1 stella, per dormire due lettini separati. La colazione fatta con alimenti pessimi. Credo che chi assegna le stelle agli hotel dovrebbe rivedere il proprio giudizio. 5 stelle superior sono una presa in giro!!",1,2015,12,12

01,Sì perde l'italiano...ed il cliente,"Ho avuto modo di soggiornare per lavoro presso il Bernini Bristol in Roma. All'arrivo subito si è salutati in inglese!!!   Qualsiasi forma protocollare prevede il saluto nella lingua del Paese e casomai dopo colloquiare nella lingua internazionale con l'aggravante che al mio arrivo ho salutato e parlato in Italiano. Successivamente con fare imperativo mi viene chiesta una carta di credito ""a garanzia"" e questo ci sta ma il modo... Accedo alla suite, pulita, vino offerto. Mancano gli accappatoi e ci sono soltanto i teli da doccia; le tende che non si chiudono con i cordoni; un bel mobile con un pezzo di legno mancante sul davanti; gli armadi senza stampelle per vestiti. Mi recò in terrazza per un caffè, lo servono lcon alcuni biscotti al burro, lo provo non riscontra il mio gusto e visto che nessuno dopo circa 10 minuti passava vicino a tavolo o non se ne avvedevano mi alzo e vado a pagare alla cassa, ripreso dalla signorina di servizio con fare scortese come se avessi commesso un oltraggio. Al mattino comunico le inefficienze al momento della Parenzo e la signora alla reception dopo aver ascoltato ltutte le cose non funzionanti mi dice ""una trageda"". Non la definisco così na mancanza di controllo. Anche se non volevo invitano il ""front office manager""  a venire ed il signore molto gentile dopo aver ascoltato le mie indicazioni mi suggerisce di avvisarmi in occasione di una mia prossima visita su Roma. In data 1 ottobre ho inviata una lettera al signore gentile con la quale ringrazio per la disponibilità ma declino l'invito.  Sicuramente non usufruire più dei loro servizi.",3,2015,10,03

L accoglienza e molto formale, i camerieri molto gentili e il sommelier molto preparato. Ci sono vari menu degustazione, ma noi abbiamo preferito ordinare alla carta. Abbiamo preso , mia moglie un antipasto, gamberi con spuma di mortadella, e fettuccine all alfredo, io ravioli di burrata, manzo crudo e cotto  e per dessert cilindro di tiramisu, il tutto accompagnato da 1 bicchiere di spumante, uno di vino bianco e una bottiglia di acqua, tutto veramente ottimo, spendendo 194 euro, forse un po caro, ma per il posto e la qualita offerta ci sta!

La spesa vale l'impresa solo durante la bella stagione quando puoi magiare all'aperto sul panorama (non bastano 150euro/persona). La lista dei vini è caricata, il percorso gastronomico, riflette il locale del Tuscolano con qualche piacevole revisione. ",4,2015,08,18

abbiamo scelto per il nostro soggiorno romano il Bernini Bristol. La posizione e' favolosa, a due passi da Piazza di Spagna e da Via Veneto. Inoltre appena fuori dall'albergo c'e' la metro, utilissima per gli spostamenti verso il Foro Italico e la Citta' del Vaticano.
Siamo stati accolti con la consueta cordialità del Gruppo Sina, ma probabilmente a causa del periodo di altissima stagione (l'albergo era al completo) abbiamo avuto diversi imprevisti che avrebbero potuto rovinarci la vacanza. L'intervento e l'esperienza del General Manager Dott. Vivalda sono stati essenziali per gestire la complessa situazione e per lasciarci un ricordo positivo alla luce del quale
non possiamo che consigliare questo storico albergo.",4,2015,05,19

01,so reist man gerne...,"Wir waren über ein verlängertes Wochenende im Hotel Bellini Bristol ! Die zentrale Lage macht es besonders einfach vom Hotel aus die Altstadt zu Fuß zu erkunden. Empfang und checkIn waren besonders freundlich und konnten gute Tipps für den Aufenthalt geben. Unser Zimmer hatte eine top Ausstattung, mit Blick auf den Piazza Barberini. Lediglich die Beleuchtung war etwas schwach und selbst am Tag wirkte das Zimmer dunkel.
Ein absolutes Highlight ist jedoch das Restaurant im achten Stock  seit kurzem mit einem Micheline ausgezeichnet bietet es Küche der obersten Klasse. Aber auch mir hier nicht essen möchte sollte unbedingt in die Bar auf einen Cocktail kommen. Der Blick über Rom und zur Peterskirche ist atemberaubend und einzig artig. Obwohl das Hotel nur acht Stockwerke hat profitiert es von der AnHöhe auf der es steht,  in der Nacht hat man die komplette Skyline von Rom vor sich .
Gerne kommen wir wieder.",5,2015,04,20
01,Eccellente soggiorno di classe,"Abbiamo soggiornato lo scorso week-end per una breve vacanza e pur sforzandomi non riesco a comprendere come alcune persone possano aver recensito questa struttura come ""pessima"".
La posizione è un dato di fatto.
L'avvenente accoglienza del personale combinata con l'incantevole visione della hall lasciano trasparire sembianze fiabesche.
Le camere, molto luminose, inebrianti e curate nel minimo dettaglio, godono di vista mozzafiato e nonostante l'affaccio diretto sulla piazza non lasciano filtrare alcun rumore:
Difficile descrivere poi a parole il panorama che ci si trova di fronte varcata la soglia del ristorante... forse superlativo è il termine giusto, oserei dire il migliore di tutta la capitale.
Insomma un grande soggiorno di lusso in cui l'unica nota triste è stata quella di dover rifare le valigie e tornare a casa.
Un plauso infine al vice direttore (di cui ahimé non ricordo il nome) che ci ha accolti come principi e presentato con cura le innovazioni apportate al nuovo look del ristorante ed allo chef, Andrea Fusco, che nonostante la rilevante fama è persona molto umile e disponibile.
Complimenti davvero!",5,2015,04,20
01,Ottimo per trasferta di lavoro,"Ottimo hotel, un po vecchiotto' ma con molto charme. I bagni comincianto a sentire il peso degli anni che passano ed andrebbero rinnovati.
Paraddossale che in tale strutture il Wifi sia ancora a pagamento..

Per il resto niente da eccepire. Ottima posizione, a 10 minuti a piedi dalla stazione ed in pieno centro a Roma.",4,2015,04,19
01,"Hotel fantastico, panorama mozzafiato!",Ho soggiornato al Bernini Bristol per lavoro e ho trovato tutto impeccabile. Cortesia dello staff e camera molto spaziosa.

01,Vista magnifica!!,"Sono stata a pranzo al Roof del Bernini Bristol. Che dire, fantastico!! Un panorama da favola che ci siamo goduti ancora di più grazie alla bellissima giornata di sole.

01,Meraviglioso soggiorno ,"Sono stata i primi di marzo con il mio ragazzo al Bernini per un weekend romantico...e così è stato!:)  il Bernini si affaccia su piazza Barberini, posizione ottima e centrale, vicinissimo  alle principali attrazioni turistiche! Abbiamo provato il ristorante Olimpo all 'ultimo piano dell'albergo! La vista mozzafiato e il cibo di qualità e ricercato ci hanno regalato una serata meravigliosa. Ritorneremo presto a trovarvi...grazie!!:)",5,2015,03,21

01,Fantastico anche per una colazione di lavoro!,"Sono stata ultimamente al Bernini Bristol per una colazione di lavoro. L'ubicazione dell'hotel è' ideale: in pieno centro di Roma; a pochi passi dalla Fermata della Metropolitana Barberini; accanto alla stazione dei Taxi. L'ambiente è' molto raffinato ed elegante; l'arredamento non è' 'pesante', ma vanta pezzi di valore. Il personale è' gentile e disponibile; assai disinvolto anche con gli stranieri. Le Sale per i convegni sono ben attrezzate; luminose, con una buona l'acustica e molto confortevoli. il,pranzo e' stato servito con un Buffet molto vario e ben organizzato. Qualità' del cibo indiscutibile; accompagnato da vini scelti. Dopo il dolce e il caffè', i camerieri hanno trasformato l'ambiente come il cambio di scenografia a teatro: in pochissimo tempo e nel più' assoluto silenzio.
Quasi senza accorgercene ci siamo ritrovati nella Sala Riunioni, a continuare ad affrontare gli argomenti presenti nell'ordine del giorno. Soddisfatti per,il gustoso pranzo e a nostro agio, in un ambiente diventato quasi 'familiare'!",5,2015,03,08

Personale cortese e molto professionale.",5,2015,01,08
01,Purtroppo deluso,"Mi dispiace esprimere un giudizio negativo ed infatti mi limito a dare tre punti, ma devo ammettere che la mia esperienza presso questo albergo è stata molto più negativa. Camere piccole e hotel decisamente troppo sfruttato, anche nelle camere ""rinnovate"". All'arrivo, nessuno ci ha accompagnato in stanza, ci è solo stato indicato il piano e il numero... Prezzi esosi in rapporto all'offerta. Le decorazioni della sala colazione erano degne di un film ""fantozziano"" ovvero le classiche stelle filanti da albero di natale appoggiate in qualche modo sulle piante esistenti, tipico da pensione più che da hotel 5 stelle lusso. Bella la sala dell'ingiustificatamente costoso ristorante all'ottavo piano, così come scomoda l'idea di aprire il bar a tempo... un po' al piano terra, un po' all'ottavo piano... Quando si paga qualcosa di più, ci si aspetta qualcosa di più.",3,2015,01,07
01,Splendido soggiorno,"Vado spesso a Roma e soggiorno sempre in questo splendido albergo situato nel punto più strategico del centro. Cosa dire, camere molto belle e pulite, servizio eccellente con la massima cura dei particolari, personale sempre cortese disponibile e professionale.
Molto suggestivo poi il ristorante al roof garden aperto fino a tardi dove mi fermo almeno una volta durante il soggiorno, in primavera poi la terrazza è splendida con vista magnifica su Roma.
Ottimo anche il servizio garage vivamente consigliato.
I prezzi infine sono decisamente vantaggiosi per un 5 stelle reali e per un ristorante di tono.
Spero di ritornarci presto

01,"Gutes Hotel, super Lage, freundliches Personal","Wir waren Anfang Dezember für 5 Nächte im Hotel. 
Der Empfang war sowohl vom Portier als auch von der Rezeptionistin sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Gleich zu Beginn wurden wir über ein Upgrade informiert, wir bezogen ohne Aufpreis eine Suite im obersten Stockwerk mit 2 Balkonen und traumhaften Blick über Rom und direkt auf den Vatikan.
Darüber hinaus erhielten wir einen Gutschein über 15% auf ein Abendessen im Hotelrestaurant.
Das Restaurant verfügt über eine schöne große Dachterrasse. 
Das Abendessen dort war sehr gut, wir hatten das Degustationsmenü inkl. Weinbereitung um ca. 50 Euro pro Person - Qualität gut, Preis eher günstig.
Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen, sehr viele Busse halten an der Piazza Barberini, direkt vor dem Hotel, und eine Ubahn Station ist auch direkt beim Hotel.
Es gibt in unmittelbarer Nähe viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sowie Lokale. 
Einige Meter rechts vom Hotel befindet sich eine Sehenswürdigkeit die Kapuzinerabtei mit ihren Katakomben. Evtl. nichts für allzu schwache Nerven, jedoch wirklich sehenswert. Die Spanische Treppe ist zu Fuß in ca. 7 Minuten zu erreichen, der Bahnhof (Flughafentransfer) in ca. 12 Minuten.

Gesamteindruck: 
Sehr gutes Hotel, freundliches Personal, sauber, gute zentrale Lage, trotzdem sehr ruhig, den Spa Bereich haben wir auf Grund des schönen Wetters nicht besucht, wir würden auch wieder ins Hotel Bernini Bristol fahren.",4,2014,12,30

Il ristorante ubicato sul roof-top è molto particolare e sicuramente da provare. La vista è mozzafiato, così come è molto bella ed ampia, la sala della colazione che si affaccia sulla storica ed affascinante, piazza Barberini.

Effettivamente la posizione è uno dei punti di forza di questo hotel, ma non tralascerei certo i servizi che mi sono sembrati all'altezza delle 5 stelleL della struttura. All'interno vi è anche una magnifica spa in cui purtroppo, dato il poco tempo disponibile, non sono andata. Ovviamente non è il tipico hotel nuovissimo e modernissimo, però credo che si integri perfettamente con l'atmosfera romana.",5,2014,09,30

Gli arredamenti delle camere sono datati, la pulizia delle camere stesse non adeguata (mobili impolverati, testiera del letto sporca, scarabocchiata, condotto dell'aria condizionata nero…), scarico del bagno che si incastrava ma, soprattutto, la biancheria del letto macchiata e con i buchi! E' inaccettabile per un hotel di questa categoria! Occorre un maggiore controllo sull'operato della lavanderia! Da segnalare invece la gentilezza del personale della reception",3,2014,09,01

01,Servizio Non da 5 stelle,"L'ubicazione e' ottima e le camere carine e pulite. Purtroppo il personale é davvero sgradevole, per nulla cordiale e gentile. Non c'e' passaggio di consegne tra i vari turnisti, poiché le cose vanno richieste e ripetute ad ogni cambio turno. Ristorante carino con ottima vista, ma aimé caro e soprattutto disorganizzato. Abbiamo atteso 20 minuti prima che qualcuno si accorgesse che c'eravamo seduti. Poi un signore arrogante ci ha portato il listino e l'ha poggiato sul tavolo, andandosene. Le bibite sono arrivate dopo buoni 15 minuti e il cibo circa dopo 40.... Positiva l'esperienza della Spa, tranquilla e molto piacevole, con una brava massaggiatrice.",2,2014,06,26

01,Un esperienza disastrosa,"Sono stato in questo hotel 2 notti e devo dire che questo hotel mi ha stupito in negativo.
In primis arroganza del capo portiere (massimiliano?)che parlava come se fosse il proprietario dell'hotel, alle mie domande e perplessità rispondeva in maniera seccata e fredda (nemmeno da 3 stelle questo portiere).
La camera era piccola, ma non sporca
Anzi la pulizia e il breakfast sono state le cose migliori.
Ristorante vicino all'albergo, consigliato dal concierge pessimo.
Sono stato recentemente ad un altro hotel a Roma di categoria inferiore (hotel Trilussa a trastevere) ma sicuramente superiore come professionalitá degli impiegati!",1,2014,06,09
01,Un classico,"Invogliato dalla fantastica primavera romana sono andato in questo Hotel classico nel centro di Roma. L'atmosfera primaverile come sempre fa da cornice a una città Eterna.

01,Un albergo per dominare Roma,"Un classico albergo che non risente del peso degli anni. A due passi dal centro e dalla stazione Termini, camere grandi e confortevoli ben insonorizzate. Dalla terrazza-ristorante all'ultimo piano si gode una splendida vista di Roma (peccato che per la colazione ci si deve adattare in un anonimo salone interno).",4,2014,05,27
01,Da prendere in seria considerazione,"Posizione eccellente, in una delle piazze belle di Roma (piazza Barberini) personale gentile, (desk un po' defilato, preannunciano un hotel che si rivelerà ottimo. A parte l'upgrade della stanza inaspettato, che mi ha assegnato una suite con i fiocchi, l'impressione è di cura, pulizia ed attenzione. Il piatto di frutta ""with compliments"" fa parte di quelle attenzioni oggi inusuali anche in un cinque stelle. Piccolo problema con il telecomando che viene affrontato e risolto immediatamente, bagno perfetto sia nella pulizia che nella dotazione (anche se il fissaggio della doccia era un po' ballerino). Letto e cuscini da manuale, per un insieme ineccepibile. Buono sconto per il ristorante gentilmente omaggiato, ed allora vado a provarlo, all'ottavo piano. Non male, ma non all'altezza del resto: in compenso la terrazza è semplicemente spettacolare come pure la vista che vi si gode: è una delle più belle che ho veduto a Roma, e ne ho viste parecchie. Un posto dove portare clienti da convincere per un buon risultato...........Ci tornerò sicuramente, mi sono piaciute molto la professionalità e l'attenzione del personale.",5,2014,05,21
01,Un'esperienza da ricordare,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per un weekend a Roma in concomitanza con l'apertura degli Internazionali BNL d'Italia.
Siamo rimasti piacevolmente sorpresi dalla cortesia e cordialità dimostrataci da tutto il personale, doti non sempre comuni negli hotel di lusso, specialmente nei confronti di famiglie con bambini.
Lo consigliamo vivamente per l'ottima posizione, in corrispondenza della fermata Barberini della metropolitana e di Via Veneto, e soprattutto per l'atmosfera ricca di fascino degli ambienti.
La piccola SPA permette di concedersi un momento rigenerante dopo un'intensa giornata culturale.
Una specialissima menzione merita la terrazza all'ottavo piano che ospita il roof restaurant ""L'Olimpo"" e dalla quale si gode un'impagabile vista delle bellezze della capitale:
da provare assolutamente l'esperienza di una cena raffinata o un aperitivo al tramonto.

La camera era con vista su Via Barberini, uno scorcio di Palazzo Barberini: nulla di particolarissimo.
La mia camera era sufficientemente grande. Con spazi comodi dove sistemare abiti, scarpe ecc. Il bagno con una efficiente doccia e flusso d'acqua abbondante. Temperatura costante.
La prima colazione da hotel di lusso, con un buon servizio di caffè espresso.
La ristorazione (ho mangiato a buffet, ma anche servito a tavola) è stata molto buona.
Tutti i servizi di meeting sono stati all'altezza delle aspettative, quindi molto raccomandabile.

01,5 Stelle L!,"Soggiorno stupendo all'Hotel Bernini, tanti piccoli dettagli e accorgimenti hanno reso l'esperienza indimenticabile!

L'Hotel si presenta maestoso, un grosso edificio che caratterizza l'intera piazza e ne diventa protagonista assieme alla stupenda Fontana. Di notte poi, illuminato com'è, mostra tutta la sua eleganza.

Ho prenotato una camera Superior con vista palazzo Barberini con tanto anticipo, chiedendo un trattamento ""premuroso"" visto che per me era un'occasione MOLTO importante.
All'arrivo sono stato splendidamente accolto dal concierge e dalla signorina M. che mi ha evidenziato che la camera per noi era con vista Piazza Barberini (anzichè il Palazzo).

Un upgrade inatteso che ho davvero gradito!

La camera (104) era grande, con splendida vista sulla piazza e sulla Fontana del Tritone, e in bella vista ad accoglierci c'era una bottiglia di vino con due bicchieri. L'ennesimo ""regalo"" che ho davvero davvero apprezzato molto!

Abbiamo trovato la camera pulita e confortevole, elegante, calda e curata. Ci è stato fornito tutto il necessario, dal set da bagno fino ai due accappatoi.

Lasciata la camera nel pomeriggio per una passeggiata, al nostro ritorno (dopo sole due ore) l'abbiamo trovata nuovamente ordinata e rassettata. Piccole cose che rendono il soggiorno a 5 stelle.

La camera, nonostante il primo piano, era molto silenziosa e ottimamente riscaldata (il termostato funzionava alla perfezione). In serata abbiamo cenato al ristorante sul tetto (L'Olimpo), alla cui recensione rimando.

Ottimo trattamento anche in fase di check out, con la signora M. (stesso nome ma diversa dipendente).

Assolutamente un soggiorno impeccabile, spero in un futuro di ripetere l'esperienza.

Evidentemente es un hotel muchísimo más caro que lo que sería en España, pero es que así es Roma y casi el resto de Italia.

Eso sí, se agradecería que hubiera wifi gratuita en todo el hotel y no sólo en el hall, como sí sucede en España.",5,2013,10,16

01,Vista mozzafiato!,"Il panorama che abbiamo goduto dal tavolo in terrazza è ineguagliabile! Anche se siamo romani, raramente capita di avere ai piedi la propria città, sfavillante di luci e riflessi dorati! La vista goduta, di per sè, vale il prezzo abbastanza consistente. Il servizio è molto accurato, pur mantenendosi cordiale. 
Al contrario, di solito, nei ristoranti di questo livello capita di usufruire di un servizio impeccabile, ma freddo ed impersonale. Qui invece maitre e camerieri, pur professionali, sono sorridenti e comunicativi. Quanto al cibo, abbiamo avuto tutte pietanze a base di pesce e posso affermare che le materie prime sono eccellenti, per freschezza e qualità. Mi ha sospreso la mancanza  di vera e propria personalità delle preparazioni. Io ho preso filetto di spigola e un trancetto di pesce spada, grigliati e al vapore, davvero delicatissimi. Mi aspettavo, forse, una maggiore inventiva ed originalità delle ricette. Immagino che possa essere dovuto al tipo di clientela che frequenta il bellissimo albergo. Per ciò che ho potuto vedere, per lo più stranieri di mezza età, ovviamente facoltosi. Posso quindi supporre che prediligano una cucina leggera e semplice, che non appesantisca negli incontri di lavoro.",5,2013,10,02
01,Molto raffinato,"L'Albergo è in un posto incantevole: Piazza Barberini. L'ambiente è classico e molto accogliente. Il servizio eccellente. Io ci sono stata diverse volte a cenare sul Roof-Garden: si ha quasi la sensazione di abbracciare Roma. E. con la gioia che solo un panorama così suggestivo può trasmettere, si possono gustare piatti di alta cucina, serviti non solo per soddisfare il palato, ma anche la vista. Le composizioni, infatti, sono raffinate e originali.
Il Roof è ideale per una cenetta romantica, ma anche per festeggiare una occasione particolare.
Sicuramente si fa una bella figura con gli ospiti. 
Dopo la cena una piacevole passeggiata nella famosa Via Veneto aiuta a completare una ""serata speciale"". Personalmente ci torno sempre con molto piacere!.",5,2013,09,14
01,zona perfetta,"L'albergo è in una delle migliori posizioni di Roma, ai piedi di Via Veneto, a pochi minuti dalle più belle piazze di Roma e, comunque, letteralmente sopra la fermata metropolitana della linea turistica. In effetti gli interni avrebbero bisogno di un rimodernamento ma le stanze con vista su piazza Barberini offrono una vista spettacolare. Il personale è stato gentilissimo durante tutto il soggiorno ed ha cercato di rendere migliore possibile il mio soggiorno. 
Un po' caro ma non dimentichiamo che, dalla terrazza, possono vedersi sia il Vaticano che il Quirinale e non è uno spettacolo che possono permettersi tanti alberghi.",4,2013,09,11
01,Che bel panorama dalla terrazza...,"Ho cenato sulla terrazza dell'hotel in occasione della festa di laurea di mio cugino.
Appena arrivata mi ha colpito il panorama da lassù... 
Poi la cena organizzata a buffet è stata ottima, e il personale veramente disponibile. ",4,2013,09,04
01,spettacolare,"Oltre alla posizione molto centrale ritengo la vista dalla terrazza dell'Hotel una delle cose belle di Roma. per il resto tutto ok. Da ritornarci anche perchè la posizione dell'hotel vicino alla metropolitana, alla stazione termini ed il centro fanno si che a piedi si possa girare un sacco di bei posti.
Suggerisco il museo Barberini a poche centinaia di metri.",4,2013,08,29
01,Deludente,Sono salito sulla terrazza del Bernini per un aperitivo. I prezzi del menu decisamente fuori misura. É naturale aspettarsi una spesa piu elevata rispetto ad un comune caffè ma un toast al prosciutto e formaggio per 16 euro fa veramente ridere. Location molto suggestiva. Il personale scontroso.assente e molto lento. Il metre o presunto tale sì è messo a riprendere la cameriera davanti ai clienti. É la mia ultima visita. Come italiano mi vergogno di una simile forma di ospitalità. ,2,2013,08,18
01,"Excelente ubicación, buenos cuartos y buen servicio","Me pareció una excelente opción. La ubicación es muy buena, los cuartos y el baño sin amplios para ser Europa. Nosotros perdimos una maleta y el personal del hotel nos ayudo mucho en el proceso de recuperarla, siempre de buena gana. Definitivamente me hospedare ahí cuando vuelva a Roma.",4,2013,07,25
01,Sehr Italienisch,"Ein gehobenes Hotel im typisch italienischen Stil. Kein zu moderner Schnick Scnack aber trotzdem sehr ansprechend und gut ausgestattet. Die Zimmer sind für Rom sehr geräumig und haben alles was man benötigt. Das Frühstück ist super, große Auswahl und ein toller Raum mit Blick. Die Dachterrasse mit dem Blick über Rom ist wunderschön und ruhig. 
Die Lage ist perfekt, U Bahn direkt neben dem Haupteingang, Trevi Brunnen zu Fuss 5 Minuten, Spanische Treppe zu Fuss 7 Minuten. Kleine Geschäfte und Restaurants direkt am Platz vor dem Hotel.",5,2013,07,08
01,Ottima posizione e rapporto qualità prezzo,"Al di là delle stelle (ormai non più indicative) l'albergo è assolutamente all'altezza

Frequentato da politici e turisti
Zona eccezzionale",4,2013,07,04
01,Ottimo in ogni senso,"Quest'hotel è davvero ideal per godersi la città di Roma. Le fermate di Bus e autobus sono ad un passo.. La terrazza all'ultimo piano ha una vista strepitosa. Bella l'atmosfera del Ristorante Olimpo e la cucina non è male. 
Il personale del  Resto è molto cordiale e preparato.
Le camere non sono esattamente il massimo ma il rapporto qualità prezzo è accettabile.",4,2013,07,01
01,Un finto 5 stelle,"Un albergo 'delabre'...
La moquette stantia e logora e' dappertutto. Appena arrivata al piano c'era una puzza di pesce che dava la nausea, perché il carrello con la cena della stanza in fondo al corridoio non era stato portato via...
La stanza era molto piccola nonostante fosse una double room, con vista su un rudere.

La colazione al mattino era povera, assolutamente non in linea con un 5 stelle.
Finita la frutta alle 9:15 i camerieri non hanno provveduto a riempire il buffet.
Un pessimo rapporto qualità / prezzo. Da evitare.",3,2013,06,25

01,"Bene, ma meglio la location che le stanze","La posizione è ottimale, in fondo a via Veneto, e questo è davvero un buon inizio. Gli ascensori molto lenti (in più non arrivano mai) fanno invece capire che l'hotel ha i suoi anni e che questi si vedono tutti. In camera, non grande, la pulizia tranquillizza ma il confort scarseggia se non si è lì in vacanza. Per esempio, trovare una presa per ricaricare computer, telefono o quant'altro è da caccia al tesoro. In compenso la sala per la colazione è luminosa, il servizio ottimo e l'offerta di alto livello, così come l'arredamento è veramente di ottimo gusto con alcuni accostamenti di colori (divani e cuscini) di grandissima classe. un ottimo albergo, a patto di inquadrarlo tra i super che pur a Roma si trovano in quantità.",4,2013,05,20
01,Ristorante Olimpo,"Ho organizzato un pranzo di lavoro con un importante ambasciatore e tutto è andato bene
Le hanno subito chiesto se non bevesse alcool , il servizio era veloce ed efficiente ed il menù business lunch è adeguato ai tempi odierni che ci costringono a correre.
La vista poi  è sempre mozzafiato, peccato che il tempo ancora incerto non ci ha permesso di mangiare in terrazzo.
Avendo avuto modo di provare il ristorante in altre occasioni di lavoro posso veramente raccomandarlo senza timore di essere smentito.",5,2013,05,19
01,Indimenticabile,"Abbiamo scelto l’hotel Bernini per il ricevimento di nozze presso il ristorante l’Olimpo: oltre al panorama emozionante, che gli ospiti hanno potuto ammirare al tramonto e di notte, è risultato tutto eccellente: l’allestimento sobrio ed elegante, la qualità del menu ottima, il personale estremamente cortese ed efficiente, la grande professionalità e sollecitudine degli organizzatori. Ne è risultata una festa  indimenticabile non solo per noi, ma anche per gli ospiti. A noi è stata anche offerta una suite, con splendida vista su Roma, per la prima notte di nozze, era perfetta! pulita, splendida piscina privata ... Grazie a tutti ancora!",5,2013,05,17
01,Fa schifo,"Ho ordinato una pizza in camera chiaramente surgelata, la salsa di pomodoro era la stessa usata per la pasta, la mozzarella era soddisfacente. Poi ho ordinato la torta del giorno ma mi è stato portato il dolce sbagliato, ed era nauseante. Prezzo totale: 60 euro.
Non andate a questo hotel!",1,2013,05,11
01,Un po' decadente,"Ottima posizione, ristorante panoramico da provare e servizio veramente curato, operatori sorridenti e disponibili.
camera doppia standard un po' fanè, niente di drammatico, ma una rinfrescata  a bagno e mobilio non farebbe male. consigliato solo se (come nel mio caso) si trova offerta sotto i 200€/notte.",4,2013,05,09
01,Insoddisfacente,"Sono stata ospite di un ricevimento sulla terrazza Roof garden di questo Hotel,
e purtroppo sono rimasta colpita negativamente.
Il servizio è disattento, inadeguato per un Hotel 5 stelle e di tale prestigio.
Durante la cena abbiamo notato più volte una disorganizzazione e una noncuranza dei particolari e dei dettagli. Le pietanze servite  erano gradevoli ma non eccelse e i dolci decisamente anonimi.
Uno dei pochi, sebbene indimenticabile aspetto positivo è la location, sensazionale è la vista su Roma, che spazia a 360° lasciando il fiato sospeso, gli arredi sono piacevoli e i tavoli ben sistemati e adornati.",2,2013,05,06
01,C'è di meglio,"Se questo e'un hotel a 5 stelle c'è da spaventarsi!!!...camere piccole..colazione eccessivamente cara(36.00€)per la qualità dei prodotti..brioche surgelate!!!..meglio farsi una colazione al bar!!

Posizione strategica a due passi dal centro, stanze in linea con la categoria 5 stelle, senza eccellere . Ottima  invece la ristorazione, ma la cosa che piu' ci ha entusiasmati e' stata la SPA : tutte le sere ci dedicavamo un paio d'ore coccolati dal personale del centro benessere, con un allenamento nella locale palestra ,piccolina ma completa, seguiti da un personal trainer e a seguire un massaggio di coppia per poi rilassarsi nella vasca idromassaggio. Una bella esperienza, da consigliare !",4,2013,03,28
01,Festa sul terrazzo...,Sono stata all'hotel Bernini Bristol lo scorso luglio ospite ad una festa di compleanno sul terrazzo...bellissimo e suggestivo:Roma di notte è veramente una favola. La cena è stata normale forse non all'altezza dell'eleganza del locale. Le camere invece sono eleganti e ben tenute.,4,2013,03,10
01,Che bella Roma........,Roma sempre bellissima ma un week end  con il sole e' impagabile e al Bernini si sta davvero bene in oltre il ristorante ha davvero ottimi piatti anche se un po' caro  La vista unica e noi ci torniamo non appena possibile ....... Lo consiglio davvero ......,4,2013,01,31
01,bella esperienza in spa,"Non posso dare giudizio sui servizi dell'albergo in quanto sono stato invitato nella spa, rispetto allo sfarzo della hall forse un po' meno lussuosa, ottima accoglienza del personale molto disponibile e professionale, soffici asciugamani, comode ciabatte monouso, ambiente raccolto,  il bagno turco spazioso alla giusta temperatura, la sauna comoda anche se non enorme, ottime le cabine dei massaggi cosi' come gli operatori.",4,2013,01,25
01,4 stelle,"Ho soggiornato qui a novembre in occasione del festival del cinema di roma. Un po' di delusione già a partire dal check-in, consentito dalle 14 in poi. Alle 13.55 la camera non era ancora pronta, quindi abbiamo dovuto aspettare per altri 15 minuti in una hall affollatissima. La camera buona, ma non entusiasmante. La tv aveva il telecomando che non funzionava, quindi ogni volta ci si doveva alzare e cambiare manualmente.. sono piccolezze che non dovrebbero succedere in un hotel 5* lusso. Nota positiva: la consierge che ci ha aiutato nelle varie prenotazioni per i ristoranti.",3,2013,01,21
01,"Buen hotel pero con ""peros""","Si encuentras una buena oferta vale la pena porque es un buen hotel y bien situado para visitar la ciudad. Habitación amplia instalaciones comunes muy bien. Es un, teórico, 5* lujo, y realmente tiene esas aspiraciones con sus precios, pero la realidad es que es un buen 4 con servicios de 5 (suben maletas, concierge, albornoz, etc). 

Hemos estado 4 noches. El personal, una lotería, por ejemplo check in con Umberto, encantador y todo facilidades. Día siguiente conserje, Dante, impertinente (pedimos recomendación para cenar, el sin consultar más hizo la reserva y después nos dice de que iba; le decimos que no queríamos gastar 40€ o mas, por persona, que queríamos algo sencillo/trattoria familiar, respuesta: si quieren también pueden tomarse una pizza en el bar de enfrente que quizás es más el nivel, sin mayor comentario, obviamente después de esto se canceló la reserva).

el problema de los 5 en roma es que estan muy apartados, este esta bien de situacion. Yo no creo que repita, probaremos alternativas pero el hotel esta bien y la estancia en general ha sido buena pero con sensación sin feeling ni valor añadido.

Devo dire che siamo rimasti entusiasmati dall'esperienza: personale cortese, sorridente, disponibile nel comprendere le esigenze individuali, professionalmente preparato.
Dalla sauna, al bagno turco, allo scrab con saponi orientali, l'idromassaggio e per finire il massaggio con olii profumati !....ci siamo riproposti di regalarci mensilmente un percorso di tre ore lontani dalla frenesia, ne vale la pena.",4,2012,12,16
01,CONFORTABLE Y BIEN UBICADO,"A destacar su excelente ubicación, a un paso de los sitios mas emblemáticos de Roma: Plaza de España, Trevi, Panteón, etc. y muy a mano de numerosos restaurantes. Se puede ir andando prácticamente a todos los sitios desde ahí. El hotel tiene aspecto de 5 estrellas y otros de 4. La habitación muy confortable y silenciosa con una enorme cama y decoración clásica pero cuidada y limpia. Quizá el baño algo anticuado pero muy limpio. El hall del hotel es muy elegante y cómodo y el persona, aunque un poco seco, atento y esforzándose en ayudarte y hablar español. El desayuno bastante escaso para un hotel de esa categoría, deslucía en comparación con el confort del comedor. No llegué a comer en el restaurante del hotel porque los precios eran desorbitados y, aunque hay un pequeño bar en recepción que no se utiliza, si quieres tomar algo te mandan a la terraza del restaurante que está en el octavo piso, y en pleno Diciembre por la noche, muy incómodo por el frío qie hacía. Los precios de comida y bebida carísimos, pero ésto ocurre en toda Roma.",4,2012,12,10

01,Non vale certamente le 5 stelle lusso,"Un hotel storico di Roma, affacciato su Piazza Berberini.
Vi sono ritornato a distanza di anni ed ho trovato molti peggioramenti rispetto alle mie precedenti presenze.
La camera, tipologia Superior, non era ben pulita, la tappezzeria presentava numerose macchie, soprattutto di umido e nere in prossimità della bocca di areazione.
La vasca del bagno era ingiallita dal calcare ed aveva lo scarico otturato da una massa maleodorante di capelli; lo specchio parzialmente scrostato.
Unica cosa adeguata il letto, morbido, confortevole e con biancheria di pregio.
Il personale??? Ragazzi, ""semo aRroma"" per cui non aspettatevi solerzia e velocità, ma qui si trova soprattutto menefreghismo e talvolta arrogante maleducazione.
Bella la terrazza, da dove si domina, con lo sguardo, tutta Roma.
Un hotel, dove si millantano le 5 stelle Lusso, con prezzi a tale ranking adeguati, ma che vale come cura, qualità e servizio, a mala pena un 3 stelle!",3,2012,11,10

Tutto é stato meraviglioso e apprezzato da tutti: le portate della cena erano tutte veramente buone e particolari, dall'antipasto al dolce. Il personale tutto di grande professionalità ma allo stesso tempo simpatico e disponibile. E che dire della vista??? Ha lasciato tutti a bocca aperta. Per chi può....é da non perdere assolutamente.
Non ero mai stata in un posto a 5 stelle (e credo che senza inviti ufficiali di lavoro mai ci potrò tornare) e resterà nel mio cuore a lungo.

01,Non proprio un 5 stelle,"Ho trascorso due notti a Roma per motivi di lavoro e mi è stata offerta una sistemazione in una stanza deluxe presso questo hotel. Non sono solita soggiornare in hotel 5 stelle ma in ottimi 4 stelle sì, pertanto mi aspettavo qualcosa di più. La mia stanza era in stile classico, ampia e con un letto molto comodo. Nonostante questo la sensazione è che ci sarebbe bisogno di qualche miglioria e di una maggiore manutenzione: il bagno non è stato ristrutturato di recente, la presa della corrente del mio comodino non funzionava, le luci erano piuttosto fioche e il materiale della scrivania era zozzo e logoro. Quello che ha messo a dura prova il mio riposo è stata la temperatura della stanza: mentre a Roma si sfioravano i 40 gradi, la camera da letto era una Siberia e non è stato facile regolare il termostato, che penso fosse rotto. La fortuna non è stata dalla mia parte! Non ho avuto tempo di salire sulla terrazza, che sono sicura essere un plus di questa struttura, ma mi sono goduta la colazione con una splendida vista su piazza Barberini.

01,Un breve soggiorno ma piacevole,"Ho accompagnato mio marito per lavoro e la scelta dell'hotel e' stata dettata semplicemente dalla posizione ottima poiche' si e' a 10 minuti dal centro di Roma ma la struttura si trova in faccia ad una piazza non troppo trafficata rispetto al resto del centro e soprattutto hai la possibilita' di parcheggiare pagando naturalmente la bellezza di 40 € a giorno( essendoci stati una sola notte non abbiamo cercato soluzioni alternative). Alla reception il personale e' competente,organizzato e risolutivo..insomma poche chiacchiere e tanta resa...addirittura una persona e' dedita solamente  a dare informazioni ai turisti che vogliono visitare il meglio della citta'.
La stanza pulita e tranquilla.Il letto comodo con una bella televisione a muro che ti permetteva di rilassarti un attimo.Il bagno pulito .Abbiamo poi cenato al ristorante dell'albergo e devo dire che la visuale dal terrazzo a non so quale piano..penso settimo ..merita davvero!Il cibo buono anche se non sono presenti tantissimi piatti e soprattutto sono costosetti..non c'e' mangiare tipico romano nel menu' ma si puo' richiedere.Una nota di merito anche al personale del ristorante professionale ma anche pronto a soddisfare esigenze e a fare qualche battuta.Sicuramente farei fare un preventivo se dovessi pernottare una settimana qui perche' abbiamo pagato parecchio ..non e' affrontabile la spesa per una famiglia di quattro persone e piu' ,per piu' notti..magari pero' fanno offerte!

01,"Buona struttura,posizione strategica,  poca attenzione al sonno del cliente","Sono stata ospite per un weekend, al Bernini Bristol. E' un albergo molto datato, ma la hall ti trasmette un sapore di eleganza e maestosità che non dispiacciono. La mia stanza, non era proprio il massimo. A parte la moquette, che per questioni di igiene dovrebbe essere estirpata da tutti gli alberghi del mondo, era molto piccola. Ma accogliente. Letto molto comodo morbidoso, e ottimi cuscini (per me letto e cuscini freschi e morbidi sono un buon biglietto da visita), e bagno molto confortevole. Purtroppo devo a malincuore dare un giudizio negativo, relativamente alla qualità del sonno. Le governanti al mattino già dalle 7, se ne fregano altamente che qualcuno (ovvero tutti) stia riposando...trattasi di weekend di relax..Sbattono porte, parlano a voce alta tra loro, sghignazzano. Insomma delle vere maleducate. Inoltre, non esistono scuri alle finestre, e le tende che dovrebbero oscurare, non oscurano per nulla. La sera entrano dentro le luci dei lampioni, che fanno effetto orange-room, la mattina all'alba è un trionfo di luce. Peccato. Davvero. Come è possibile che nessuno possa essersi accorto, che le tende non favorisono il totale oscuramento della camera? Chiudo con una nota positiva: sala colazione fantastica con una bellissima veduta su piazza Barberini e prodotti di ottima qualità e vasta scelta. La posizione dell'albergo è strategica.",3,2012,04,03
01,"Albergo molto buono, con una vista mozzafiato","Siamo stati a Roma per il nostro anniversario di matrimonio che, casualmente, è il 14 febbraio. Abbiamo scelto il Bernini perchè volevamo testarlo da tempo.

Che dire? Beh, non si può che cominciare dalla posizione: incantevole per la vista (il tramonto dalla terrazza è davvero emozionante), comodissima per ogni tipo di spostamento. A piedi si arriva ovunque in tempi brevi, c'è il metro e sulla Piazza Barberini sosta un grande numero di taxi.

La nostra stanza non era particolarmente grande, ma era confortevole e silenziosissima nonostante il traffico; ho particolarmente apprezzato il grande bagno con la finestra e la semplicità e l'efficacia della regolazione del riscaldamento. Le piccole note negative sono quelle comuni a troppi alberghi di lusso italiani: la vasca idromassaggio datata, le rubinetterie non particolarmente lustre (anche se la pulizia era eccellente), fare la doccia è sempre poco confortevole senza un box moderno, i sanitari sono sacrificati in angolini che ne rendono l'utilizzo difficile a chi abbia una statura sopra la media.

Abbiamo ricevuto un'accoglienza e un trattamento davvero eccellente da parte dello staff, che si è prodigato per riservarci un tavolo nel già esaurito ristorante L'Olimpo, per la cena del 14 febbraio e che in ogni occasione si è dimostrato disponibile e cortese.

Tra i difetti, anche questi tipici degli alberghi di questo tipo e non specifici del Bernini, un costo a mio parere troppo elevato del frigobar (anche se più contenuto rispetto ad altri alberghi di pari livello), l'inaccettabile pretesa di far pagare - a prezzi salatissimi - la connessione ad internet, e il costo della colazione che come sempre abbiamo evitato (una mattina mi sono affacciato per dare un'occhiata alla sala colazioni e non mi è parso che i buffet meritassero un prezzo a persona di circa 25 € per la colazione continentale e di circa 35 per quella americana, ma devo ammettere che si tratta di un'impressione superficiale).

In definitiva, un buon soggiorno con molti aspetti positivi e solo qualche piccola pecca (ripeto, purtroppo comune a moltissimi alberghi italiani). Per avere l'eccellenza occorrerebbe correggere questi nei.

A differenza di altri alberghi simili che ho già recensito, al Bernini però tornerei.",4,2012,02,18

La maggior parte del personale quando gli chiedevi qualcosa sembrava che ti facevano un favore a farti quella cosa, non era un  piacere per loro lavorare. Posso assicurare che non abbiamo mai chiesto cose impossibili oppure difficili da ottenere. 
Essendo in Hotel a 5 stelle in centro, che ospita anche personaggi famosi, ci aspettavamo più efficienza e rapidita.

01,Top Lage- Frühstück in Ordnung - leider sehr laut,"Wir haben dieses Hotel Anfang September diesen Jahres für 4 Nächte besucht. Die Lage am Piazza Barberini ist hervorragend, direkt im Zentrum, Bushaltestelle/Metro/Taxi direkt vor der Tür. Die Preise sind überall im Hotel exorbitant, eine Cola in der Minibar kostet 7,50Euro für eine 0,33l Dose, ein Steak für 2 im Hotelrestaurant auf der Dachterasse 80 Euro (für Hotelgäste gibt es einen 15% Voucher, aber bei den Preisen sind wir dann lieber woanders hingegangen). Der Blick von der Dachterasse ist toll, das Frühstück wird allerdings in einem anderen Raum auf der 1.Etage serviert. Die Auswahl ist in Ordnung, für italienische Verhältnisse sogar recht opulent. Der Service beim Frühstück was allerdings recht langsam und nicht wirklich aufmerksam, auf Tee und Kaffee musste man teilweise sehr lange warten. Falls das Frühstück nicht im Zimmerpreis inklusive ist, kostet es laut Hotelpreisliste über 35 Euro, das ist indiskutabel. Das grösste Problem des Hotels ist definitiv die Lautstärke. Das Zimmer im 2. Stock zur Strasse heraus war unglaublich laut, da direkt vor der Tür eine Bushaltestelle liegt, wo auch nachts noch Busse fahren. Ausserdem konnte man durch die recht dünne Verbindungstür auch die Nachbarn hören, die teilweise sehr spät nachts noch zurück kamen und sehr laut waren. Im obligatorischen Zettel im Zimmer, welcher den Zimmerpreis ausweist, ist der Preis für Zimmer und Nacht mit 950€ angegeben... Das haben wir zwar nicht bezahlt, aber es zeigt deutlich die Preispolitik des Hotels...",3,2011,09,06

Abbiamo pagato una tariffa da cinque stelle, ma la camera era piccola e la pulizia assolutamente insufficiente. Inoltre l'arredamento, e soprattutto gli impianti del bagno,. erano obsoleti e bisognosi di una manutenzione più accurata. Anche la prima colazione era all'altezza di un tre stelle.
Una nota molto positiva è la competenza del portiere, sia sui servizi della città, che sui siti turistici, gli orari, ecc",3,2011,08,08
01,Demasiado caro,"Muy caro para lo que es el hotel, esta en plena reforma y pagas 350€ la noche x un standar room. Ademas esta vacio y da fea impresion",2,2011,06,16
01,"Molto classico, perfetto per chi ama il lusso 'in stile italiano'","Hotel storico, con sicuramente il fascino di essere una delle icone di Roma. Si tratta di una struttura di altissimo pregio, con il personale decisamente disponibile e cortese.
Le camere sono in stile, con letti ampi e grande bagno.
Sicuramente lontanissimo dal mio stile iper moderno e giovane, ma n ogni caso ho apprezzato ogni dettaglio.
Il prezzo e' decisamente alto, ma corretto se si pensa a dove si dorme.
Molto comodo per il centro di Roma.
unica nota negativa gli ascensori lentissimi...",4,2011,06,02
01,No es un hotel de cinco estrella,"Por el tamaño de las habitaciones , el de los baños ( tres o cuatro metros cuadrados), la falta de limpieza ( solicité hasta dos veces cuando llegué que me limpiaran la habitación), el ruido de la calle y el trato despótico sobre todo de los camareros del restaurante y bar no puede ser un hotel de cinco estrellas. Solo lo podría ser por ubicación, precios y la terraza de la azotea.",3,2011,05,25
01,Ma Che camera calda!,"Ho prenotato una camera direttamente telefonando all'albergo senza servirmi di un agenzia esterna pur sapendo Che avrei risparmiato, mi hanno offerto una camera Deluxe per 4 notti al prezzo di 330 euro a notte con colazione,mi e' stata data una camera Che era cosi calda Che purtroppo io, Mia moglie e Mia figlia abbiamo dormino solo un paio di ore e solo per lo sfinimento! Quando mi e' stato detto Che l'aria condizionata non era in funzione perche non era ancora stagione(330 euro x notte!) mi e' stata assegnata una camera nel lato opposite dell'hotel dove la camera non certo fresca ci ha permesso di dormire per le successive notti. Il personale e' cordiale sia alla reception, alla colazione,al ristorante dove abbiamo cenato una sera,la camera pulita, e se non fosse Che per il caldo in camera non esiterei a ritornarci. L'hotel e' da considersi un  4 stelle con personale a 5 stelle, (grazie Chiara! incredibilmente gentile). Un appunto alla direzione Sina:investite al Bernini, il personale da solo non puo' far miracoli!!!",4,2011,05,05
01,Forse non ho avuto fortuna,"Hotel chiaramente molto bello, forse poco luminoso, ma con un eccezionale terrazza all’ultimo piano dalla quale è possibile ammirare il panorama sulla città e cenare o prendere l’aperitivo. Unico neo la camera, forse non ho avuto fortuna, ma la camera che io ho avuto era veramente piccola: letto da una piazza e mezza e porta che apre verso l’esterno!",3,2011,02,21
01,Benissimo!,Hotel perfetto nel pieno centro di Roma. Stanze spaziose e servizio molto buono. Abbiamo mangiato nel ristorante sulla terrazza.. Fantastico e tutto molto buono.. Che vista!!,5,2011,01,17
01,Muy centrico y con encato,"Para mi la experiencia en el hotel Bernini ha sido inmejorable, el personal es muy atento y amable, las habitaciones son amplias y con encanto. Los desayunos completos y con vistas a la plaza Barberini. Definitivamente se merece las 5 estrellas, esperamos volver a tener la oportunidad de alojarnos alli.",5,2011,01,06
01,in die jahre gekommene 5 sterne,"Altitalienischer Adelscharme zu sehr überteuerten preisen... wenn man der 930EUR rack rate im Kleiderschrank glauben schenken mag...die lobby ist zwar renoviert worden aber den zimmern steht das hoffentlich noch bevor, wenngleich sie gepflegt sind. service etc ist die 5 staubigen sterne wert.... und die dachterrasse ist schier unbezahlbar...",3,2010,11,22
01,Coccolarsi a roma,"Recentemente ho avuto occasione di soggiornare al Bernini Bristol e non esito a consigliarlo a tutti. Hotel sicuramente all'altezza delle aspettative.
La camera era ampia ed arredeata con gusto, sempre riordinata dal personale di servizio in modo ineccepibile. 
La cosa che più ricorderò è, sicuramente, il roof garden ( spelendida terrazza con vista sull'intera città) in cui ho avuto modo di prender l'aperitivo e di cenare: in entrambe le occasioni sono stata positivamente impressionata dal servizio e dalla cortesia del personale. Ottima anche la cena, costantemente accompagnata dalla musica del pianoforte.
Lo consiglio a chiunque voglia concedersi un soggiono di qualità a Roma, specialmente se in coppia.",5,2010,11,15
01,Quel che cercavamo l' abbiamo trovato qui!!!,"L'abbiamo scelto tra tanti visitati per il giorno del ns matrimonio. Avevamo grandi aspettative ma è stata la professionalità nella cura nei dettagli che ci ha fatto trascorrere una giornata indimenticabile. Siamo stati coccolati da tutto lo staff sin dall' inizio.  La camera ci lasciato senza fiato per la vista dal suo terrazzo, per lo stile e per la pulizia. Il ristorante al roof garden è un' esperienza da provare tra l'ottima cucina, la cortesia del servizio e il bellissimo panorama.
Noi ci torneremo!!!",5,2010,10,20
01,"Ottimo hotel, posizione, qualita' e servizi ottimi","Consiglio vivamente questo hotel a chi volesse fermarsi per uno o piu giorni nella citta' eterna. Il trattamento che il Bernini ci ha offerto é stato eccellente, la gentilezza delle persone, la loro disponibilità non e mai mancata. Il menu da noi assaporato quotidianamente é stato ottimo. Roof garden con vista mozzafiato..... Ottima la posizione per chi vuole ammirare le bellezze di Roma. Ci hanno lasciato un bellissimo ricordo. Non mancherà occasione di ritornarci....",5,2010,10,13
01,Bellissimo,"Ho soggiornato per la seconda volta in questo hotel e l'ho trovato ancora perfetto,personale gentilissimo,camera spaziosa con una vista splendida su piazza Barberini,colazione abbondante,servizio in camera ottimo. 
Non è il miglior hotel di Roma ma sicuramente ne vale la pena!",4,2010,10,04
01,Hotel mit kleinen Mängeln,"Hotel mit guter Lage. Die Zimmer sind modern  eingerichtet , Flatscreen vorhanden.Das Badezimmer ist für ein Firstclass entsprechend ausgestattet. Fruchtkorb  stehtt als Willkommensgruß auf dem Zimmer. Zu empfehlen ist das Dachterrassenrestaurant mit guter Küche und traumhaften Blick über die Dächer Roms bis zum Petersdom.
Der Service beim Frühstück hat noch jede Menge Potential. Der Preis für das Frühstücksbuffet entspricht auf keinen Fall einem Spitzenhotel, es war schlichtweg eine Enttäuschung. In jedem reisführer steht verzichten sie auf das Frühstück im Hotel, das trifft hier voll zu. Durch seine zentrale Lage ( Trevibrunnen, Spanische Treppe) und das Gourmetrestaurant kann ich dieses Hotel weiterempfehlen",4,2010,07,19
01,spendete meglio i vostri soldi..,"sono stato 5 giorni con i miei amici in una stanza tripla che hanno il coraggio di chiamare junior suite... dovevamo moverci una alla volta.
polvere a non finire in tutto l'hotel in particolar modo nella camera sulla moquette.
il personale del ristorante molto scontruoso il cibo abbastanza buono.
se vi serve internet, andate fuori dal loro internet point, un pc lentissimo.",1,2010,06,03
01,Bueno,Creo que es uno de los mejores hoteles de 5 estrellas de ROma y encima centrico,4,2010,03,27
01,Excelente hotel,"Me hicieron dudar a la hora de hacer la reserva las críticas que había leido referentes a este hotel. Ahora, después de haber vuelto, me alegro de no haberlas tenido en cuenta. En mi opinión es un excelente hotel. La habitación en donde hemos estado era grande. Había una gran cama de matrimonio y en una especie de salita adyacente una cama para mi hijo. El baño no era demasiado grande, pero estaba muy limpio, que es lo más importante. La decoración del hotel es muy palaciega, un poco clásica quizás para mi gusto, pero todo está muy cuidado. El desayuno, que teníamos incluído, es muy variado, con huevos fritos, revueltos, bacon, salchichas, zumos variados, frutas, quesos y embutidos, dulces y té, café o capuchino. El trato del personal es muy correcto y amable. También tiene un centro wellness del que no puedo decir nada ya que no hemos tenido tiempo de verlo ya que nos interesaba más Roma. Es importante decir que su ubicación es ideal para visitar la ciudad, está muy céntrico y se puede ir andando a casi todos los lugares turísticos, además de tener una estación de metro en la misma puerta. En fin, es un hotel muy recomendable y al que pienso volver cuando vuelva a Roma.",5,2009,08,23
01,piacevole esperienza,"posizione strategica per la visita dei maggiori monumenti
vista superba su roma dalla terrazza, ma anche dalla camera
la vista era piacevole. Al  quarto piano si avvertiva un po' di rumore dalla sottostante piazza.Camera spaziosa ,bene
ordinata e confortevole. In bagno pero' l'acqua della doccia tardava a riscaldarsi. Servizio alla reception e al bar inappuntabile",4,2009,01,20
01,Incredibilmente pessimo per un 5 star,"E' veramente incredibile. Uno schifo di hotel mai visto. Servizio pessimo, gentilezza nulla, camere old fashion e anche con puzza di detersivi.
Sia io che mia moglie lo sconsigliamo vivamente!!
State lontani",1,2008,09,19
01,Es ist sein Geld Wert !,"Habe ein verlängertes Wochenende (3 Nächte) zu einem sehr moderaten Zimmerpreis ( € 220,00 pro Nacht mit Frühstück für zwei Persoen) in diesem sehr guten Hotel verbracht. Die Lage zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten ist super, man erreicht vieles zu Fuss. Zimmer gross und sehr sauber, mit Blick auf die Piazza Bernini im 4.OG, dadurch auch kaum eine Lärmbelästigung. Frühstücksbüffett lässt keine Wünsche offen. Personal ist  freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Ein 5 Sterne Hotel das ich nur Empfehlen kann.",4,2008,04,01
01,Luna de miel en el Bernini Bristol,"Me alojé con mi marido en el Bernini Bristol durante los dos primeros días de mi luna de miel en Italia.
Escogimos un paquete especial ""Luna de Miel"", que incluía un regalo de bienvenida y una cena gratis en el restaurante del Hotel. Resultaba realmente caro, pero se supone que para eso son las lunas de miel... 
El obsequio resultó ser una botella de champán y una rosa en la habitación, la primera noche.
En cuanto a la cena, fue una experiencia maravillosa... El restaurante está en la azotea, y desde el mismo puede admirarse una vista espectacular de toda la ciudad, con la basílica de San Pedro iluminada al fondo. Un pianista tocando a la luz de las velas, ambiente relajado y ameno... 

Pensábamos que se trataría de un menú prefijado; sin embargo, el regalo era una cena a la carta... La cena fue deliciosa, el servicio más que correcto, excepcional... Para nosotros resultó una auténtica experiencia, como si de repente entráramos a formar parte de una película ambientada en un lugar de lujo.

En cuanto a la habitación, simplemente perfecta. Con una decoración elegante, con mucho gusto.

Una muy grata experiencia.",5,2007,11,16
01,Nella Media o poco sotto,"Ho letto che altri hanno trovato questo hotel superlativo. A mio avviso, si colloca un po' sotto la media della categoria. La stanza (deluxe) in cui ho soggiornato era in stile classico, ampia, con un letto molto grande e una bella carta da parati. Ho avuto tuttavia la sensazione che l'hotel si gioverebbe molto di una ristrutturazione, per migliorare prima di tutto i bagni, che mostrano diversi anni e sono di dimensioni decisamente ridotte, tanto che non sapevo dove mettere il beauty case in quanto non c'era alcun posto per poggiarlo, e con ancora l'uso di vasca da bagno con doccia, francamente inattesa in un hotel di questa categoria e con questi prezzi. Il personale alla reception si è dimostrato competente sebbene un po' freddino. Nell'insieme, una esperienza accettabile ma per il futuro guarderò altrove.",3,2007,11,14
