28,"Great location, outdated facilities.","The location and views of Barcelona are absolutely stunning. Staff were helpful and friendly. However the facilities are in desperate need of renovation, broken shower in the room, scolding hot showers in the spa, cockroaches… many other items that were outdated across the building. We enjoyed the location but will not come back until it has been renovated",3,2024,08,30
28,Wonderful experience--Wonderful Memories,"We arrived early in the morning--way before our check in time. We had intended to store our luggage and go out exploring, but we were told we could check in right away. We were offered glasses of the local cava wine and made comfortable while they prepared our room and took our luggage up. We booked a terrace room with a view and it was spectacular! The views are amazing! We were able to eat a quick brunch before catching a cab to to into the city of Barcelona.
All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful! Rose' assisted us at checkin and with several other things. She is very personal and friendly. She was able to secure us another ride and refund after our scheduled ride did not arrive. She talked about things to see and do in the city and we enjoyed her company. Pedro, Dani, and Mariano were also helpful to us in getting us change and taking care of little things we needed.

We ordered room service and it was SPECTACULAR! It was such a treat for us. A large variety of food and large portions. We also ate at the Poolside Restaurant. It was wonderful with a great view of the city and bay of Barcelona.",5,2024,06,27
28,Lovely luxurious hotel with wonderful views and an amazing team to ensure your stay is memorable.,"This is a lovely hotel set in the hills above Barcelona. We had an amazing corner suite which gave us wonderful views of Barcelona and the sea.

The furnishings are beautiful and high quality. Apparently next year is their centenary and they  are planning a big refurb but hopefully more maintenance rather than changing too much. 

The staff are superb - the moment you walk in, you are made to feel welcome and ‘special’. They are incredibly helpful and go out of their way to make your stay memorable.

It feels a very luxurious hotel - we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was perfect. 

We will definitely be returning next year.",5,2024,03,29
28,A must stay @ Gran Hotel LA Florida,"Amazing hotel, the building stands out at the top of the mountain and can be seen standing above Barcelona!  Our suite was lovely with beautiful views of the city from every window! At night the city lit up was stunning.  Huge comfortable bed, plenty of towels and toiletries provided.  Staff amazing, helpful and friendly, Ferran gave us lots of information about the city and where to go!  Lovely spa, swimming pool, jacuzzi, gym eqtsnd sauna with everything provided.  And finally the restaurant, had the most delicious meal, food beautifully presented and tasted devine, with impeccable service. Only thing you need to be aware of is that you need to get a taxi to and from Barcelona city, on average €30 a time  but using the FREENOW app was useful and take the price not the metered method and that can be a lot more!  But the hotel stay is more than worth the taxi rides!",5,2024,02,22
28,Amazing Hotel ,"An amazing hotel with great staff! We enjoyed our stay very much. The view on Barcelona is stunning and the rooms very well equiped. We hope to be back soon. A special thanks to the GM Isaac and the team. The food is delicious and the spa and pool area marvelous. Once again, thanks for a great stay!",5,2023,10,24
28,Luxury overlooking Barcelona,"Prepare to be impressed. They will greet you at the door and  whisk you into the lobby.  The hotel sprawls out, slowly unveiling water features, lounges and the indoor outdoor pool. The most impressive is the views of the city and water from the terrace and rooms. The Spa is luxurious and the massage will dissolve the worst jet leg and make you feel amazing.  Book here for a stay or come for dinner or a drink to watch the sunset. City lights at night are spectacular too.",5,2023,09,28
28,Mixed bag of good and bad,"Stayed for 2 nights. The Mountain View room was not as described which we sorted so that was good. The views from the hotel are amazing as are the staff in the restaurants and on reception. We also loved the very cold pool. 
The good ends there! 
This is a 5 star hotel which feels like it’s about to close. The main restaurant was shut leaving very few real dining options and it is somewhat isolated. The terrace bar and restaurant offer mediocre food… much of which was cooked from frozen shop bought. Room service menu is very limited too. 
The rooms are a little tired and our shower was very old and in need of new fittings. 
Hotel publicises an airport shuttle- there isn’t one. Also publicises coffee machine. First room didn’t have one , second one did but the 2 pods on arrival are not replaced unless you pay 3 euros per pod. 
Simply not at all 5 star",3,2023,09,17
28,STAY HERE!!!!,One of the greatest hotel experiences of my life. From check in to check out this hotel obviously prides itself on taking care of the patrons. They made me feel like a VIP at every turn. The room was beautiful and comfortable. The food was excellent. Service was impeccable. I cannot say enough about this hotel and the service team. We were able to hike around our hotel and enjoy the stunning view. The city center was a 20 minute cab ride away but I will 100% return to this hotel when we come back to Barcelona!,5,2023,09,06
28,Quite an average experience,"We had a good stay and enjoyed the hotel. The mediocre rating is because while the 1 night stay was good, it could have been so much better with just a little more effort.

The main issue was that the service was not very professional. It was surely friendly and all of the employees were nice but it felt that they were just working there and didn’t get proper hospitality training. Except in the restaurant at dinner, there the staff were very professional.

The room was nice and spacious. We loved the view over the city and the sea. We stayed there in January and the heating was on at +26C. It was absolutely hot in the room. It was regulated by the hotel so we couldn’t turn it off and asked the staff to help. 

The bar area in the garden was nice and the cocktails were very good but the service was extremely slow. 

Half of the spa/indoor pool area was closed without any prior notice (the spa was one of the reasons we went there). The steam room was closed so only the sauna was on. The pool was large but absolutely freezing so all the guests were crammed together in the hot jacuzzi. Aside from that, half of the showers were broken and/or clogged and the whole area needs proper maintenance and a good scrub. 

The service at the restaurant both at dinner as well as breakfast were very professional. Also the food was good, especially the breakfast. The dinner was served in a smaller area and really lacked atmosphere. 

All in all, we weren’t disappointed but it didn’t live up to expectations either. The service needs an update to better reflect international hospitality standards and the fact that the spa was partially closed should have been communicated.",3,2023,06,26
28,Amazing place with really warm service,"We spent five days in Adorra hiking. We wanted to enjoy the last two days in a nice hotel. This was a really wonderful place. Great service,  warm staff, lovely swimming pool, tasty food and wonderful scenery. we had an absolutely amazing room with two balconies, an absolutely amazing bed and a spacious bathroom. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. All pictures of the hotel on the website are true.",5,2023,06,16
28,Speechless,"It has to be one of the best and finest hotels I have ever stayed in. Impeccable service, amazing views, fine dining and so much more. From the amazing terrace, the wonderful spa, the products from L’Occitane (my personal favorite) to the refined details. This hotel is an oasis just outside Barcelona. Close enough to enjoy the city yet far enough away to discover true peace and tranquillity. Highly recommended.",5,2023,06,06
28,Gran Basura Hotel La Florida,"The worst customer service
at Gran Hotel La Florida. Today, Friday, we got a call with a last minute cancellation of my husband’s surprise birthday celebration next Thursday (less than a week) that included spa treatments and luncheon because a private event “popped up” in their calendar and in order to honor our reservation we would have to additionally book a room or they would cancel. Really? We live down the street. Why didn’t they communicate this “private event” when I made reservations weeks ago??  Not an effort to accommodate and nothing more that “sorry for the inconvenience”.  What arrogance!  Never again we will set foot at this establishment.",1,2023,04,21
28,Boutique hotel with stunning views ,"Beautiful boutique hotel with stunning rooftop views.
Staff were so friendly and accommodating and also child friendly. 

Breakfast in hotel was varied with patries, cereals, fruit, traditional spanish warm breakfast and request for eggs etc.

The hotel is quite out of the central tourist area and is about a 20-25 minute drive away, longer during peak traffic times. Average cost 30-40 euro each way in taxi.

Also the indoor pool is NOT HEATED- some reviews incorrectly state that it is. There is a small jacuzzi / hot tub indoors which is heated but no actual heated swimming pool. 
",4,2023,04,09
28,Would not recommend for detail-oriented people,"At first sight it seems stunning before you start notice details which should not be at 5* hotel. By arriving we had already known about hotel history, and it was slightly shabby, especially in the room. In the beginning it seemed as highlight (due to history again) but during week we felt that there is too much of this shabby and it is looked as poor condition. We had higher expectations from breakfast, we ordered it only once – cold scrambled eggs and worst cup of coffee. Room details: curtain was not fixed properly; a spiderweb on the wall; damaged electrical socket. During week only once we got all bathroom amenities, other days always something was missed (especially cotton buds complect). Once the room’s door was not closed properly. In addition, it was found out that hotel shuttle is not available anymore, before Covid times it worked regularly. Summarizing, it seems that hotel is cutting costs from whatever is possible. From pluses: a view, friendly staff and big comfortable bed. Anyway, minuses outweigh much the pluses.",3,2023,03,02
28,Would have been 5 stars except for a few issues,"A beautiful hotel, lovely rooms and communal areas,  with great staff.

Special mention to Natalia on reception  - permanently cheerful, helpful and pleasant. Also Sergei who welcomed us upon arrival and helped with bags. And Giselle on night reception. All a credit to your hotel.

All of the staff we encountered were helpful.

We changed rooms on our second day, to a room with a balcony. This room was as nice as the first but the tv didn't work (not the end of the world) and when I came to use the bath, there was no plug, a trickle of water, and the water was cold. When I phoned reception,  they sent maintenance up , but there was nothing they could do that late in the day and said it would be repaired the next day whilst we were out. We were offered an alternative room but felt that was unecessary as the shower worked perfectly. When we returned from a long day out the next day, the tap still didn't work, and the water was still cold. Disappointing, but dealt with admirably by both Natalia and Giselle - much appreciated. I hope I have spelled everyones name correctly. 

The hotel itself is beautiful,  smells lovely too.

We had a treatment in the spa - a gorgeous spa and Mary and Carolina were great therapists.

You will need a car or a taxi to go out, there aren't any bars or restaurants nearby. One restaurant at the hotel was closed (maybe because it was late in the year), and the restaurant we used had a fairly limited choice. 

We wouldn't hesitate to return. Even though we experienced a few issues, they were dealt with in such a good manner, we were genuinely impressed. Thank you.",4,2022,11,13
28,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"My family loved staying at this hotel. Not only was the hotel amazing, but especially the staff. The breakfast was delicious and the restaurant serves great food with a beautiful view of Barcelona. A super attraction esp. for kids is the swimming pool. View from the hotel is breath-taking. I hope we will return to the hotel in the future. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,16
28,Gorgeous hotel and great service,"We stayed at the hotel for our anniversary and we couldn’t be happier! We were treated wonderfully and the staff at reception were fantastic! Warm and friendly and not at all stiff! The building is so beautiful and the rooms are to die for. Fantastic wooden floors and massive bathroom and bedroom. The terrace room are wonderful as the view from there is amazing. 
Very classy and stylish without being stuck up.attention to detail and staff was always very helpful! It’s very luxurious yet very warm and welcoming. 
The pool is just gorgeous and the view- well it’s quite extra ordinary! You definitely won’t be disappointed! It’s such an amazing hotel!",5,2022,09,18
28,Beautiful hotel just a bit too far from Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel, great views, great and very spacious rooms, amazing staff. Very stylish.
It is too far from Barcelona and it is a nightmare to try and get a taxi. The swimming pool water was cold.
Perfect for a family for a remote retreat if you don't want to enjoy Barcelona.",4,2022,09,10
28,Exceptional,The hotel was just perfect. We were warmly welcomed by Sergio. All the staff was extremely professional and kind. We stayed in a room with a big terrace overlooking the city. The room was comfortable and large with a big bathroom and the view which was breathtaking and will be the reason to come back again. The pool was refreshing after hot days down in Barcelona. The memory of staying in this hotel will not fade away.,5,2022,08,16
28,Unpleasant stay (compensated) but very pleasant view,"I will start with the main mishap.

We stayed there for two nights, when we arrived, we had a room booked for 2 adults and 1 child (8 years old). We were upgraded to the top suite. It was a duplex room with bed on the top floor, washroom, wardrobe and sitting area on the lower level. We were amazed with the upgrade and felt quite happy about it. We soon found out that the AC was not working in the bedroom. We complained and the staff said it will be looked into. We went out. When we came back at night, it was so hot! We went down and complained again only to be told that the only thing they can do is to close the ac completely and we can let the fresh breeze come on. Mind it, we were on the top floor on a hotel which is at the toppest point in Barcelona. I got upset that what kind of solution is this? When you know that my son is only 8 and there are no barriers on the window. I went down again and spoke the staff at the reception. This was all happening 11 pm at night! That guy came and said AC will not work, rooms are all occupied. I told him the only solution then is to bring the mattress down at the lower level. My husband and the staff brought the mattress down. We slept on the mattress of such a huge hotel! 

Next day we were told that they will find a solution, either room change or ac will get fixed. We went and reminded them. We were told, both cannot be done. It was quite apparent that the AC of that room was not working since before and will not work after as well. When I told them that we will not be paying for two days if we have to sleep on the mattress on the floor, we were offered free breakfast for a day and 100 Euros to spend in the restaurant.

Coming to the restaurant, the food choice is extremely limited, extremely. 

The best features and the reason for the rating:

- The view! 
- Only 7 mins walk to Sagrada Familia and Tibidabo amusement park
- The staff at reception and restaurant 
- housekeeping was also good and very efficient",3,2022,08,14
28,Best hotel experience I can remember,"The rooms, facilities, view and service were truly spectacular.  We loved staying a bit outside of Barcelona and up on the mountain.  Getting to the city was a quick, 15 minute cab ride.  I could go on at length about many things we liked about that place, but everything was just perfect.  I’d HIGHLY recommended this place and I don’t think I’ve ever given a 5/5 rating before.",5,2022,08,01
28,Back again....says it all!,"Great to see the hotel open again  and wr had an excellent 2 nights here celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.  We had a great room with the signature lovely views over barcelona. Some minor rehabs to the fittings need to be addressed, but overall, the experience here is business as usual. 
The pool is as wonderful as ever, and the staff go more than the extra mile yo give a great experience. Am searching for another significant event to have an excuse to return!",5,2022,07,30
28,Bad experience,"Bad experience.  You know after a long day traveling all you wanna do is take a hot shower and go to bed. 

No hot water and the water you do get is

***GROSS DARK COLORED WATER FLOWS FROM SHOWER AND SINK FAUCETS*** 

The hotel has been neglected. It was probably nice five years ago but they really let to go. 

I’m very annoyed at this point.  If you’re considering this property keep in mind that it’s dilapidated uncapped and the management it’s not real concerned.",1,2022,06,11
28,"Incredible, personal service at a classic hotel","I can't say enough good things about this beautiful old hotel. The staff (Giselle and Marc at the front desk) were absolutely wonderful - helpful, friendly, professional, and kind. And my room was HUGE, with a terrace that faced the city. (The manager even sent up a bottle of sparkling wine to welcome me!) I needed urgent help with getting my Covid test and the staff went above and beyond to help me, taking a lot of stress off my trip. There's also an enormous, gorgeous L-shaped pool, half inside, half outside. And there's nowhere else to get this kind of view of the city. It was a perfectly fancy and memorable experience.",5,2022,06,07
28,What an amazing hotel and staff!!,"My pet we and I went on a road trip for a week to south Spain and back to Barcelona. We slept at 4 different 5 and 5 star hotels. Grand hotel la Florida was our last night in Spain.  
What an amazing choice! Can’t rate it higher cause the app doesn’t let me. 
The food!! An amazing staff to really make you feel the ***** hotel you are in so kind and genuinely friendly. The rooms amazing!!! Vintage in a 100% perfect and comfortable way. The bed was incredibly comfy. 
Over all EXCELENTE !! Don’t think twice guys it’s worth the money if that is what stops you. ",5,2020,01,31
28,Stunning and amazing place to stay!,The is a stunning hotel and we enjoyed every moment. We went with our 2 sons to celebrate my birthday. The staff were excellent to my sons. The hotel is excellent and will for sure go back soon! The views are stunning and location is excellent. A cab ride down to the centre is only 20 mins and worth staying up on the hills and enjoy the views.,5,2020,01,14
28,Three night stay,"Had a wonderful time at this lovely hotel.
We enjoyed exploring the tourist parts during the day then getting the shuttle back at 430 and relaxing in the spa area before having our evening meal in the bistro, the food and drinks are pricey and I didn't like paying 7 euro for a latte, but we have taken away fond memories from our trip and we also enjoyed facials in the spa which were very relaxing.
We found the staff particularly reception staff and the driver exceptional.",5,2020,01,12
28,Amazing stay. Can’t say enough.,"I don’t know where to start...the property, the views, or the incredible service. In short, it was all brilliant and our stay was amazing. 

We stayed at the Gran Hotel La Florida for the last two days of our Barcelona trip. The property is situated up on the mountain overlooking the city - the views are amazing. For context, it was about a 20-minute cab ride to the airport.

We had our two young kids and all of the hotel employees were great with them. We ordered room service one night and they brought up extra juice and chocolate milk for the kids. 

The property itself was beautiful. We spent a lot of time hanging out in the lobby bar area. The pool was incredible. Our room was very large and overlooked the city. 

Just amazing, we loved our stay!

",5,2019,12,25
28,Amazing hotel!,"We only went there for coffee, after our visit to Tibidabo park. The huge lounge is amazing! So cozy, warm and comfortable, so relaxing! There is a pool and a balcony with great view of the city. We payed 12 euros for 2 coffees but it surely worth it!",5,2019,12,11
28,Relaxing hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times and i decided to take a few minutes to write a review because it is a place i always enjoy so much. The staff has always been courteous, professional and attentive. The rooms are airy and decorated in a classic style. I recommend the rooms overlooking the city and the forest. You have to bear in mind that this hotel is a bit further away from the city and it really feels like a relaxing retreat for me. The bar is very welcoming with various sofas to chill in and enjoy a drink. I absolutely love the pool.  Overall this place has a lot to offer. We were also a party of a wedding on one opportunity and it was perfect wedding  from the dining to the dancing party.  
Like i said this hotel has a lot to offer and i recommend it.",5,2019,11,28
28,"Stunning views, marvelous people but hotel is outdated ","The hotel is known for its views, which is 100% true. The staff is amazing and very friendly. The location of the hotel towards central barcelona is quite difficult since you need to go all the way down from the mountain every time you’d like to go and taxis are not coming that frequently. Indoor pool is good, but space is chilly because it is in one room with the gym, which is odd. The bar area is old fashioned, just like the rooms. Breakfast is excellent! We had preferred to give a 3.5/5 rating. The hotel pretends to be a 5star hotel, which it is at some points but not everything. ",4,2019,11,26
28,"5 star experience, amazing views","After 5 days in a downtown Barcelona hotel I decided to spend my last night in Barcelona in the mountains at this 5 star accomodation. My sea/city view room with balcony was beautiful. Really amazing views over Barcelona. Front desk (Guillem) and room service staff (Hugo) very friendly, professional and efficient. The food quality was good.  
The gym was disappointing, very small, and not much equipment and no weights at all. That should de improved. Welness sauna/pool was great and very well maintained and clean. I can recommend this hotel if you want to relax, enjoy the great views and for the welness area.",5,2019,11,21
28,I love this hotel!,"My husband and I have just returned from a short break at the Gran Florida. We have stayed at this hotel many times and it feels like I am returning home to family. A wonderful relaxing stay, beautiful views of Barcelona. The quality of the food is good and more importantly the staff are welcoming and ensure your stay is perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to go back.",5,2019,11,10
28,Stunning views and service,"The drive up to the hotel is fantastic with incredible views of the city below and the hotel perched at the top of the mountain. We were greeted by friendly staff and a glass of Cava. Both our rooms were great and the facilities super.
You won't go wrong with the breakfast, whether you order in or go down for the buffet.
My only suggestion would be that they toss out the worn towels and gowns with holes.
It may not be convenient in terms of access to the city but very much worth a stay. 
The setting is straight out of a fairytale and made our honeymoon all that more magical.",4,2019,11,09
28,A magical one of a kind setting,"This hotel is really unlike any other. Its setting up on the mountain gives breath taking views of the city below. The style and decor is 1920s meets Gothica and it truly is unique. Pool is excellent, spa great & staff wonderful. The food and drink is priced reasonably and the breakfast is a good mix of spanish traditional and continental dishes. The warm and welcoming feel
of this hotel makes it perfect for a total unwind break, a place
to get away, disconnect and be inspired. Its wonderful",5,2019,11,06
28,Escape to tranquility,Had three nights at this hotel and had a fantastic day I was super pleased with the room. The cleanliness of you is to die for and was very lucky with the weather that we could be outside and enjoy the sunshine are you both breakfast and lunch in November did you use all the Barcelona fantastic only concern is that one night we decided to eat dinner there in the restaurant for dinner is I hate to say it not good at all I was very displeased with my me up in people decide they sent it back but clearly the night time cook is different from the last cook so stay there and eat breakfast and eat lunch go out for dinner,5,2019,11,06
28,Most amazing hotel with views to match,"Gran Hotel La Florida was the perfect luxury base for our recent trip to Barcelona. It is a wonderful hotel with staff who are so courteous and helpful.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite but having stayed here 12 years ago, all the rooms are fabulous. 

There is a shuttle bus a couple of times a day to take you into the city itself (as the hotel is situated on the top of a hill overlooking the city). 

Visit if you can 👍🏼",5,2019,11,02
28,"Magnificent views, 5 star hotel and great service",We had 3 fantastic nights at La Florida with amazing views over Barcelona. The hotel facilities were exceptional as was the service. The room was spacious and well appointed. There is a midrange bistro and a fine dining restaurant - both of which were excellent. Breakfast overlooking the city was inspiring. Highly recommend.,5,2019,10,26
28,"Great service, beautiful views but quite a drive into the city ","Stayed here in September with a friend. Very impressed with our room, beautiful views and very spacious. If you’re looking to chill out and relax this is a great spot. The indoor pool area could do with a little maintenance but overall we received great service and were able to take advantage of the free shuttle into town most days. Just be aware that it is a good 20 minutes out of the centre of Barcelona so if the shuttle isn’t available be prepared to pay for cabs. There are no restaurants nearby (walking distance) so you’re limited to the hotel. Hotel staff gave great recommendations though and it was easy enough to get a cab, but it’s worth accounting for an extra €50 per day for this. ",4,2019,10,20
28,Not a luxury hotel- old and terrible service,"We stayed last weekend in this hotel which was terrible. Its located next to a kids theme park which is very noisy as soon as you open the window let alone if staying in the garden. We expected  a serene luxury hotel in a quiet location but it turned out to be of low quality with an awful service. The only positive element which comes to my mind is the view. 

The check in was unpleasant. We had to wait, queue and wait gain. 
With a garden and a spa this should habe not been an issue except that the hotel does not have a relaxing lounge or spa area and the waiting experience turned out to be a torture. We went to the “spa” (which is not a real spa just a few cabins) and without receptionist to help us get a cabin key. Only after 30 min we were able to manage to get a therapist out of the treatment rooms to give us a key. The shower ( both in the mens changing room and female room) look very old and did not work properly and was overflowing. After the shower we went to the garden (although it was 24 degrees) the whole garden area was closed. Anyway it was very noisy with kids screaming from the kids attraction park glued to the garden area. We went to the restaurant  and were the only customers in the whole restaurant on a Saturday at 1 pm. The food was not good and although we were extremely hungry we ended up eating only bread with olive oil. The bill was high. After having “seen” the hotel we just wanted to leave. We went to the manager to tell him that we want to leave and would like a refund as we had already paid in advance. Obviously he refused, offered us to refund the lunch ( which at todays phone call he refused as he said he offered us complementary breakfast instead ) which we a) did not want or even use and b) be this was not what he initially offered.) 

Finally we stayed as we were very tiered.
There were insects in the room. ( Again all they offered is to send housekeeping with a spray).

The lights in the bathroom did not work. And the room was terribly noisy due to the road with many lorries every few seconds. 

Careful this is not a luxury hotel. Its very dated and the service is unacceptable.",1,2019,10,15
28,Room to improve,"Overall a lovely and cozy place, I will continue to come back. Charming and characterful place with patina. 
However a 5 star hotel requires, getting the small things right as well. 
Gym is in a desperate and bad condition and If you are up for a spa day, lower your expectations. Cleanliness and maintenance of the place is substandard.",3,2019,10,14
28,Mr,"So the good points. Very stunning hotel with the wow factor. Amazing upon arrival, very nice pool area and terrace. Had a massage and was fantastic if a little pricey but the girl that did it was amazing. 
Bad points. There are many. 
Expensive extras. I felt the charge for parking at £25 per night was unnecessary. I would expect this in a city centre hotel but not one 4 miles out. I booked this as it said parking available. I didn’t realise it would cost me extra. Also the shuttle is pretty pointless. Fully booked most days and last one back at 4pm. Had to use my own car to get to Barca so had to pay another £25 per day in the city. So £50 per day parking. Customer service is definitely not 5 star. We had an expensive bottle of wine on the terrace when we arrived, when our room was ready we asked for it to be taken to the room. It never arrived. When we went down for dinner I asked about it. They went and found it, brought it through and served it warm at room temp. 
The coffee machine didn’t work in our room so I mentioned it to reception that it was broken. She advised me that someone would look at it. I said we hadn’t been able to have a cup of coffee this morning but she said nothing. I certainly wasn’t going to buy one in the lounge at the prices they charge. I would have thought a 5 star establishment would have offered one free of charge as it should have been free in the room. Anyway the machine did work on our return but had broken again by the next morning. 
For some strange reason the light bulbs in our reading lights in our room were removed on our last night. Not sure why. Very odd, but made sitting on the sofa reading difficult in the evening. The jacuzzi in our room had to be filled up by staff when you wanted to use it. I had to ask 4 times before it was finally filled. On our first night we arrived back after dinner and room service had sorted our room. Which was very nice. The blinds were down but I wanted to see the city lights. So I used the remote to open them. Unfortunately 3 of them opened and 1 stayed down. So I pressed the down button expecting the 3 to come back down which they did, but the other one also unwound more then went back up and kept going over the top of the reel. Whacking the silk each time. This continued for about 5 minutes. We ended up sleeping with 1 blind up which meant that we were woken nice and early in the morning with the sunlight in our eyes. We told reception that they were broke and they were fixed by that evening. 
We asked reception if we needed to book for the gastronomic restaurant. They said they didn’t take bookings at reception, not sure why.. and sent us to the pool bar to book it. We spoke to the guy on the bar who said he would book it for us and guess what, we arrived for dinner and no reservation. The main problem with this hotel seems to be communication, no one really seems to care or pass messages on. No one takes ownership of making things happen. Also don’t buy a beer here. It cost us 6 euro for a small beer. Absolute rip off. Even down in the city centre at Catalan square, one of the main tourist places you can get a large beer in Hard Rock Cafe for 5euro., all the cafes were charging 2euro. Total rip off.",3,2019,10,11
28,HEAVEN!,"I proposed to my girlfriend here and she said yes. An absolutely divine experience from the moment we booked, until we left. We booked the large terrace room with stunning views of Barcelona and the coast. 

We visited at the time of the Spanish F1 GP (which was also amazing!) but the hotel was not really packed with F1 fans as it is a little out of the main Barcelona district and key points of interest, which was great for us. The pools, gym and sauna are also great and worth mentioning. 

We received a complimentary cake when we arrived which was a lovely touch, as is the daily turndown service. The only slight compliant is the room attracts flies and bugs, because it has huge open patio doors and windows, leading to the private terrace, as well as the local area being ""rural"". There is nothing else around there so do some shopping on your way there to stock up on supplies.",5,2019,10,10
28,"Great location, mediocre service, terrible food","The location is great, atop a hill above Barcelona (although you should accept 30 minutes drives each top you come and go to the center). The hotel is of rather ancient architecture, with a good level of refurbishment inside. 

The quality of service clearly is below average, the concept of being helpful and rigorous is not in the mood. Cleaning equipment left in the room, inroom breakfast left for the whole day, stupid wake-up call in the middle of the night - disappointing, at least. 

The worst is the food, which probably is cooked as an apology of surrealism. 

Note : some rooms are noisy because of the proximity of the Tibidabo amusement park.",2,2019,09,29
28,"HORROR HOTEL BED BUGS EVERYWHERE!!!! Super old!
Service catastrophe !!!Dirty pool!!!!!
Don’t visit u will be shocked!!","We stayed in the Gran hotel la Florida over our 2nd wedding anniversary from 7-10th of September.
We chose the hotel because it looks really good on the website especially the view !!!!
But as soon as we arrived we were shocked!!!
Nowhere on the internet u see that hat there is a street around the hotel which is super noisy!!!! Also most of the rooms are just on the street, above the high frequented street it’s super loud!!!
Also nobody says that there is a funfair NEXT to the hotel it’s incredibly noisy and soooo annoying! 
The pool has 15 degrees and is dirty like hell so no chance to get in.

But now let me tell you about the worst! 
From the first night on we had weird bites especially on our upper bodies but we thought ok mosquitos like everywhere. 
BUT NO !!!! Last day we were checking the the bed completely and also the linen to be sure we won’t forget something and then we found BED BUGS 🐜 IN THE BED!!!!!!! No joke there are bed bugs in the bed! See the photo I uploaded! 
We called the staff immediately but they said nothing cause the manager was not available they didn’t know where she was so nothing happened no apologies nothing !!  When we said we won’t pay the full night they said ok so we call the police. 
After some days we finally managed to contact the manger and guess what she told us, these are no bed bugs it’s a lint and they won’t even apologize. 
Well I got allergic to the bites and had to go to the doctor!
We made a complaint at the police !!! 

TRUST ME NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL ITS JUST WASTE OF TIME AND HORRIBLE !!!",1,2019,09,17
28,Bliss,"The hotel is definitely a 5 star hotel, the staff were excellent, the rooms were large and well ventilated, well equipped to the warm weather with AC the hotel smelt amazing with quality products been used throughout. The gift shop is great as well. Only thing was if you did not request breakfast or dinner they can be quite expensive but they do have private free shuttle in/out the centre of Barcelona daily where you can have breakfast and lunch. 

The view from the top where it’s located is so beautiful where you see the entire Barcelona city inclusive of the sea. If you do not want to be in the hustle and bustle of central Barcelona or too close to the beach then it’s a perfect spot for RR.

The gym is a bit small and machines could be updated but that’s a minor complain.",5,2019,09,16
28,Exceptional! ,"Loved everything about this hotel where we stayed for two nights. Service was fantastic, food and drinks amazing. We had a mountain facing room where I didn’t expect to have much of a view but it had sensational views and could go to the terrace for views of the city. 

Room was large, great quality amenities. Very comfortable bed. 

Staff on front desk very helpful. Can not fault our stay here. 

",5,2019,09,12
28,Juste un grand merci,"Amazing stay at the Gran Hotel la Florida, we had the chance to enjoy and spend the night in one of the suite offering an unique view over Barcelona.
Quiet and clean common spaces, perfect location if you want to disconnect.
Pleasant breakfast area with natural light and lots of varieties at the buffet.
Special mention to Guillem, Sergio, Sergi and Roger for make us feel welcome and special at any moment.

Marina and Victoria",5,2019,09,09
28,"Excellent, quiet, comfortable, and great breakfast","Excellent breakfast. Quiet and peaceful location, yet close to downtown. Rooms are large and very comfortable. Hotel has arrangements with real club prat golf; you will need a rental car or arrange for transportation. Hotel is 25 mns from la Rambla.",5,2019,09,04
28,Hidden gem,"We’ve just spent 10 nights at La Florida. This was a return trip to this hotel, we found it last year and loved it. It’s great to be out the city, at the same time very easy to get in by cab or bus. Lovely rooms and decor, great pool and terrace. But more than anything the staff make this hotel what it is. Only criticism, it’s a little pricey to eat and drink, but that said the rooms and hotel and service make the value proposition strong. We will return. A mention to Hugo the most cheerful room service we’ve ever met. Thanks to all at the hotel. ",5,2019,08,08
28,"Fabulous, restful stay","We were a little bit worried about being so far out of the centre of Barcelona but acutally this turned out to be a wonderfully, restful one night stay for us after a busy cruise.  The hotel had everything that we could possibly need, a great bedroom with spectacular views and a superb bathroom. We enjoyed dining al fresco on the terrace for breakfast, lunch and dinner - all of which were of a very good standard.  One night was not enough for us so we very much hope to return.  The only down side was the hotel shuttle bus for the centre of Barcelona (20 minutes) that ran once in the morning and once in the evening.",5,2019,08,07
28,Amazing,"I just loved this hotel.  The fact that it is out of town is a blessing as the air is clearer and fresher up the hill. A more regular hotel shuttle service would be preferable but that is the only negative remark that I have to make. 
The views over Barcelona and the mountains are outstanding. Our room was large, beautifully appointed with dual aspect views from two balconies, the bed was super king and very comfortable and I wanted to take the bathroom suite home with me.  
The decor throughout is beautiful and the pool and facilities excellent. 
We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner outside on the terrace and, although not inexpensive, the food was excellent.
A special mention has to be given to the front office staff who were welcoming, friendly, efficient and unflappable.   
We only stayed one night between finishing a cruise and flying home but intend to return for a relaxing break at the earliest opportunity.",5,2019,08,06
28,Restful,"Had a great time - yes you are out of the city but you are up the mountain, quiet with clean cool air, the hotel bus service isn't great but (mainly full) but you can take the public bus, funicular railway and tube (all part of the experience) Pools are great, a G&T will set you back about 18 Euro, staff are good, room was clean and had what we needed, social areas are charming and comfortable. Breakfast was fault less. Great time had!.",5,2019,07,21
28,Good Hotel but Very Expensive Food,"The hotel has some very nice views of Barcelona, as it's situated at the top of the Tibidabo area. Views are stunning, and the hotel has a nice swimming pool area. 

However, be warned: The big disadvantage of this hotel is that the pool bar and the hotel's restaurant are both *very* expensive. We are talking prices like €20 for a hamburger, or €28 just for breakfast. The fact that there are no other hotels or restaurants in the area means that you are stuck with only this option: the very unbelievably expensive dining offered at the hotel. As for us, we paid around €100 per person per day just to eat!",4,2019,07,16
28,Disappointing,"We visited GHLF as a family to celebrate my 50th birthday. The promised shuttle into town was always full, luckily there was a public bus available as it was a public holiday otherwise we would have spent a fortune travelling into central Barcelona. There is nothing to do around the hotel except visit Tibidabo, which our children loved but which is very expensive. 

The pool was very cold, despite claims it was heated, the seating area around was dark and neglected. The sauna was shabby and the jacuzzi always filled to the brim with guests unable to swim in the pool. 

Service was friendly, breakfasts were good. The family room was fine with a comfortable mattress. Generally the hotel felt unloved and not up to 5-star standard",2,2019,07,06
28,Amazing Experience,"From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted with courteous staff and incredible decor. The room was impeccable, a terrace with a jacuzzi over looking the city of Barcelona is something we will never forget. Highly recommend the restaurant at the hotel-the sommelier has great knowledge of wine and such an awesome personality. We got a massage at the spa, and it did not disappoint. Again, the service was amazing. The staff made our trip perfect, they spoke English and offered many recommendations for our stay in Barcelona. Thanks again for the great experience!!",5,2019,07,04
28,Worth traveling for ,"Absolutely fantastic hotel full of old time charm with modern touch. Beautiful spacious rooms, lovely terrace with a great pool and bar to enjoy the tremendous views over Barcelona. Friendly attentive staff. Full of enjoyable details both visualy and in service. A shuttle 3 times a day to and from Barcelona makes it fairly easy to visit the town. 
This hotel went right to my top 5 of hotels that I have ever visited. Would love to go back. ",5,2019,06,26
28,Boutique hotel with amazing views but...,"This boutique hotel is situated at one of the highest points just outside Barcelona which is around 20-25 mins taxi drive to the centre. The lobby has unique character which is replicated in the rooms to a good standard. The room was spacious with huge windows overlooking the city. The cleaner leaves a nice touch by leaving a chocolate/cake in the evening. 

The terrace is really nice with a decent size pool which leads indoor out of the sun. The gym was pretty mediocre though, but ok for cardio. 

However the service is not reflective of a 5 star hotel. Given the location there are not many restaurants or amenities around so I would have expected the hotel restaurant to be at a reasonable standard. The food was over priced and limited which was the most disappointing part of our stay. Firstly, the waiters didn’t repeat food orders so on more than one occasion the orders were wrong or forgotten. We were also served 2 extremely rare burgers despite asking for medium/well done. When they were recooked they were severely dismantled and we were never offered an apology, discount or a fresh burger.

The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the centre which we were told on our first evening that it couldn’t be booked and to turn up at the departure time but when we tried to do this the following day, it turned out it was fully booked when we came to use it, which wasted our time. On the plus side there is a €3 bus right outside the hotel that takes you to the centre which was useful and we used this as oppose to the limited unreliable service they offer. Although it doesn’t run that late. Overall based on the service we experienced and the limited amenities around I wouldn’t recommend this hotel and would not class it as a 5 star hotel.",2,2019,06,25
28,"REGULAR VISTOR TREATED HORRIBLY BY CRISTINA [-] , GENERAL MANAGER","CORRUPT CRISTINA (General Manager!) 3rd time here, this time for 12 nights. On 4th night there was bone in my room service burger that cracked my molar tooth in half causing me agonising pain. After complaining, they were silent for over a week. I complained again, a manager told me that they knew a good dentist where they made an appointment for me. The dentist removed the broken tooth and recommended a full extraction when I returned home. The dentist also provided me with a formal letter explaining the damage and that it could only have been caused by the bone in my burger. The general manager Cristina [-] (please see other reviewers comments after interacting with this animal) that had ignored my complaint all week and was clearly just waiting for me to check out so that she didn't have to speak to me. On my last night I managed to track Cristina down and she refused  to acknowledge that the hotel was responsible. I showed her the dentists letter and she said ""So what, that proves nothing, I can have any dentist in Spain write whatever I tell them too!"" completely disregarding that this was the dentist THEY sent me to. I said the hotel is responsible for my costs/pain/tooth extraction, she refused and asked us to LEAVE the hotel or she would call the police and have us forcefully removed. She threatened us multiple times in front of other guests in the main lobby.See bad reviews for similar experience with Cristina by others. I have all the proof documented/photos.",1,2019,06,25
28,Beautiful but hidden costs ,"Beautiful hotel, with great views of the city however a few niggles from our stay that others should bear in mind...

Hotel advertises a free shuttle to the city - this however only has 7 spaces at 3 times of the day so needs to be booked in advance.  We when arrived it was fully booked for all the days we were there so we ended up spending €100+ in taxis to and from the city centre.

Food and drinks at the hotel are generally quite expensive.  Expect to pay €150 plus for dinner for two in the top restaurant (great food and great staff). The next day in the city we had a good 3 course lunch just off las Ramblas for €50.

One of the restaurants wasn’t open the night we stayed there for dinner because of an event.  The next day we couldn’t have breakfast on the terrace because they were doing a photoshoot.  Unfortunate timing but came with little apology from the staff.

There was also no coffee in the rooms and only 2 tea bags - would expect more from a 5* hotel on this front.",3,2019,06,03
28,Exquisite,"Boutique hotel with the most incredible views in all of Barcelona. Original elements perfectly aged blend with timeless, posh furnishings.  The hotel has a history as a hospital and private residence of a high profile physician. Now it’s home away from home for tourists worldwide. The spa featuring Loccitane products is not to be missed! An ordinary tea time becomes extraordinary from the terrace.",5,2019,05,31
28,Fun Cava brunch with friends from Barcelona after a week of hard work,"Hotel is sumptuous. Orchids everywhere. Model wooden Spanish armada ships. Elegant furnishings. And the view out towards the blue water is spectacular. Our brunch was delicious, sitting outside in the springtime.",5,2019,05,21
28,Customer Services are Shocking for a 5 star hotel,"My husband and I had a lovely stay, but found that all extras are not clearly advertised if you are relying on hotel information folders, so left with a very unpleasant feeling after receiving our final bill.  Staff are happy to assist whilst taking your money, however if you have an issue, they pass the buck, and will not compromise.  Customer relations are shocking.  

The hotel is lovely, and the views are stunning, but getting into the centre of Barcelona is an adventure, as the courtesy taxi has very little availability and the times are not convenient for a hotel which is a 20 minute stay out of the centre.",2,2019,05,14
28,Fantastic stay - well worth a visit,"We enjoyed a fantastic 5 night stay at Gran Hotel La Florida, taking a few days to explore the city and a couple of days to enjoy the wonderful facilities and setting at the hotel. 

The views from this hotel, and from our room in particular, were the highlight of our stay and could not be found anywhere else in the city. 

The hotel feels modern and luxurious at the same time, with a nice lobby and spa area in addition to some outdoor seating areas with great views over the city.

From arriving we were made to feel very welcome and were very well 
 looked after until the moment we left. 

From Giselle who greeted us on arrival and made sure that we had everything we needed, to Mariano who drove us to the city on the shuttle and recommended some great restaurants and areas in the city, every member of staff added a real touch of class to the experience of staying here. 

Roger was also a big help before we got there and ensured that our stay would be a memorable one. 

If you are planning a trip to Barcelona soon and looking to find somewhere to relax in between enjoying the sights of the city then you should definitely consider La Florida.",5,2019,05,05
28,Great experience - apart from money missing,"This was our first visit to Barcelona, and the hotel was an excellent place to stay. The staff were warm and friendly, the room had a glorious view over the city and the facilities (pool, terraces to sit out on etc) made it all the more attractive. The breakfast, in particular, was a daily high spot. We tried the gourmet restaurant the first night - the waiters made the evening, and the food was well prepared and tasty. Sadly the shadow over the stay was a sum of money being taken from our locked  room the first night - with the hotel seeming unwilling to accept that such a thing could happen.",3,2019,05,01
28,Miss,"I’m here with my boyfriend we only arrived last night but I felt I had to comment on the amazing customer service we’ve received so far. Everyone we’ve spoken to has been very friendly and very helpful, including a man called Ricardo who showed us round the hotel before showing us to our room. When we went for a little drink in the bar the staff member (we didn’t catch his name) did not sit down once. As soon as our glasses were empty he was there to fill our wine glass up, kept bringing little bowls of snacks, just really worked hard.

Our room is beautiful as is the view. Cannot fault this hotel.",5,2019,04,06
28,"Exceptional hotel, not very well run","The place is absolutely fantastic, the pity is that it is not at all well run. Personnel is unexperienced, award, clumsly, well below the standard the hotel deserves. In a saturday afternoon, there was a moment that all the reception area was deserted of personnel.
The hotel begins to show signs of aging, maintenance should be upgraded.
Yet the place is unbeatable in Barcelona: the views, the building, the spa, the wide rooms, the impressive bathrooms with the giant shower, the common areas.",4,2019,04,01
28,Do you want relax and enjoy Barcelona at the same time? Come here!,"I've stayed this weekend for a quick ""escapade""in Barcelona and i just loved the hotel. Wonderful Hotel,great service,amazing breakfast and marvelous view of the city. You can even have the privilege to swim admiring a breathtaking view of the city. Special mention for the night guy Oscar which has welcomed us in a perfect five star way and helped us out late in the night. Check out smooth, attentive and helpful advices from a lady with glasses( sorry didn't take the name). 

Only issue? Just one night stay :( 
We will come back indeed.",5,2019,02,26
28,"Once a 5 star hotel, maybe not now","I had high expectations based on locals recommendations. The room we had was nice and the veranda with the views over Barcelona were definitely the highlights. Once we started using the hotel’s amenities, that’s when stars started coming off of the review. We booked a couples massage at L’Occitane’s spa in the hotel. The massage itself was very nice and worth the money but it was not as nice as I would have expected for this level of hotel/spa. The jacuzzi was next to the pool so when we went from the spa out to use it, we found a group of 10 women in it with little room for me and my wife. Most spa’s we’ve gone to have had a private jacuzzi so you can feel a little special. We went to the pool one night to swim and wanted to sit around for a drink after but they didn’t have enough space heaters for all the seating areas, so we couldn’t sit by the bar and enjoy the cool fresh air. Finally, the thermostat was not working properly and even when I turned it off completely, there was heat blowing into the room. I ended up having to leave an outside door open all night to keep it cool enough to sleep. All in all, we had a nice time and the people were very friendly but the hotel can’t justify keeping a 5 star rating.",3,2019,02,25
28,amazing location and facilities,"Stayed here 9th Feb 3 nights .Birthday treat for my wife .We both loved it used all the facilities pool .sauna .gym etc .Staff were so friendly and informative nothing fazes them .Used their free shuttle into city every day   WHAT A SERVICE   .

28,Spectacular View & Hotel Service,"Daughters Birthday treat from Wife with girls in December 2018.
The Hotel is although far from Centre is gloriously located up on a hill overlooking the beautiful Bay into Barcelona. It's a beautiful building with tradition & History.

We were provided with an upgrade which was greatly appreciated, that provided wonderful pan view from the windows overlooking largely pleasant weather outside.

Hotel Staff were brilliant to family at all times.
We used the shuttle service to go visit further into Barcelona, which was a real bonus.
Beds were extremely comfortable & room had excellent amenities.

Breakfast was generous & plentiful.
Hotel is immaculate & kept pristine clean.
We loved the pool to enjoy and soak after walking around Barcelona.

We were lucky going off season to enjoy the place, which would most probably be packed during summer months. Highly recommend the Hotel with a difference in terms of service, location & amenities. Truly 5 Star experience!!
Great birthday celebration enjoyed by the Girls.",5,2019,02,12
28,As amazing as the views!,"The hotels situation is fabulous, you can see the sunrise, as well as the sunset from there. Well situated on top of the hill, next to an amazing church, which is beautiful. You can see the Pyrenees mountain range on a clear day, as well as the whole city of Barcelona. There is a beautiful fragrance that fills the hotel when you enter, which is most unusual. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the two concierge from the hotel. Really nice people. Very nice breakfast deliciously laid out, again, with a fabulous view over Barcelona. The hotel is about 8 kms from the city centre, but the shuttle and taxis make the journey easy. It was nice to get out of the hussle and bussle of the city at the end of the day. The lunch menu  available,was mainly tapas, nice, but quite expensive, as is the dining room in the evening. There is a pool, and a very nice jacuzzi. Would definitely  return.",5,2019,02,06
28,Pre-wedding visit,"Myself, my fiance and our parents stayed here for 2 nights for a pre-wedding trip. From start to finish our overall experience was truly amazing. The hotel is so beautiful and the staff were fantastic and attentive. The rooms are a great size and beautifully decorated. We stayed in a suite with views that took my breath away. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is so peaceful and really helps you unwind. I can't wait to get married here and show my friends and family the place that has become so special to us.",5,2019,01,29
28,Four Night Stay in Barcelona,"I arrived early to check in, but was offered sparkling wine and a tour around the hotel. My room was a deluxe type with balcony on the fourth floor with views of Tibibado Church and also Montserrat and part of the city. The room was clean and spacious but could benefit from some minor refurbishment. Breakfast offered plenty of choice and quality of food and drinks, and in the winter season, there is only one restaurant. The hotel overlooks the city and is very quiet, although it is 5 degrees colder than in Barcelona. There is a free shuttle service that operates three time a day during the winter, so it is convenient for guests. I do recommend that you book the shuttle as there are a limited amount of seats on offer. The best asset of this hotel was its staff. In particular, I would like to thank Alex, Maria, Roger, Sergie and Mariano for making my stay extra special and enjoyable.",4,2019,01,19
28,Very nice hotel out of the city,"We chose this hotel as it was out of the city and we were looking for something quiet and it was perfect. The bonus was an excellent spa and a restaurant with first class food, and a very nice terrace bar with stunning views of the city. Staff were all great and very helpful especially Sergi on the front door. ",5,2019,01,16
28,Run down hotel,"Hotel with excellent location and views on the city, but ... terrible service (house keeping does work, tower suite and spa area asking badly for refurbishment, shuttle bus basically not accessible and staff not interested at all to please hotel guests). It seems that they just not care ...",2,2019,01,16
28,You could not pay me to stay here again...,"To give a foundation to this review, I use TA a lot, I don’t review unless I am overwhelmed positively or negatively. I’d class myself as well traveled and meticulous in my planning. 

Why did I pick Gran Hotel La Florida? It’s views, top of a mountain. 5 star, so expected class and great service for New Years Eve celebrations.

Perspective... instead of celebrating New Years Eve at a pre-booked party here. I’m sat in my room writing a review which I know so many will use.

Service: shocking, genuinely unapologetic, lack of leadership and minimal understanding of hospitality. Why? We paid about £900 for a room with a view of the city (amazing view). However on arrival the huge door would not open. Reported, no apology, maintenance head into room with ladder, takes handle off and the door is left a jar. I then had to call again and almost prove the door was broke... he then came again and screwed it shut... no apology, no other room, no here’s a bottle for your room. Basically, that doors broke, we can’t fix it. Granted there is another door but it’s about principle and experience for me. If one car door is broke... you don’t get told to just use the other one.

Spa... I went to use the pool, there were 2 members of staff a male and female stood in the males changing room talking and doing little work. Shouldn’t happen. And when I entered they continued... so I couldn’t actually get changed. Stinks of unprofessional. Just adds to the bad vibes.

Party... we reserved the New Year’s Eve party, open bar €110 euro. 11pm until 3am. So we stayed in, and headed downstairs at just gone 11. The bar staff had absolutely no idea that there was a party on... besides dinner. They then between the 3 of them realised there was indeed a party... and decided it was at 01:00am... not 11:00am... this as you can imagine really put the nail in the coffin for me. I mean it’s New Year’s Eve... even if you didn’t know there was a party in your OWN hotel that YOU work in... you would hazard a guess that there is probably one that you just don’t know about. Absolutely astonishing. I headed to front desk (fair play to Oscar... he seemed just as fed up as me, admitted it was practically a joke and said there is definitely a party). Whilst talking to Oscar... the other chap who realised there was a party had told my partner it was now actually at 11:30... so I sat down absolutely bemused... whilst they literally ran around almost setting up the infamous party... they offered me a glass of Cava while I waited... and then proceeded... wait for it... to HAND ME A BILL FOR 18 euros... for the 2 drinks... and €110 for the party of the century... 

As you can imagine I quickly headed to the front desk and told Oscar just how unhappy I was, he apologised and put it down to his colleague being stressed... he advised we wouldn’t have to pay for the drink... but unfortunately for me the damage was done. We cancelled the party and thought it better to leave. New Years Eve well and truly ruined... the whole stay has been dreadful, and this was the new year to bring in my 30th. The hotel needs new management and someone who has experience. I have given them ample opportunity to fix the problems and to no avail and I will be asking on checkout for compensation.

Other factors to consider, the prices are EXTORTIONATE... Literally I’ve travelled the world and nowhere have I felt so ripped off... €6 euros for a coffee, €5 euros for a packet of crisp... €6 euros for a small glass bottle of coke out of the honour bar... there is NO HONOUR in that. What planet are these people on? It’s a bottle of coke... 

It screams of money first service last. It’s well and truly a disgrace - and they will reply to this review thanks for comments blah blah blah but for anyone with any wits about them... take your money elsewhere as this place is for the rich and stupid...

And unless they refund me partially this review will stay. As this has been a woeful trip...",1,2018,12,31
28,"Beautiful hotel, could do better with facilities within the room","Positive things first - the hotel is beautiful, at the top of a hill overlooking Barcelona. The view of the city from the hotel rooms are spectacular. The staff was very courteous and professional. It has a very nice pool.

 We had an issue with the room that was assigned to us - the a/c was not working in addition to making noise, the towel heater (calientador de toallas) was constantly ON, inspite of us trying to turn it off, heating up the bathroom and the master bedroom. Compounded with the a/c not working, we had to spend the whole night with room temperature at 25 C. The staff had volunteered to move us to a different room in the night. But it was quite late at night. The next day we were upgraded to penthouse suite at no additional cost. Overall, it was a nice experience. I would have given it a 5 star, if we had not encountered issues with our room on the first night. The management need to incorporate a thorough quality check in their process prior to assigning a room to guests.",4,2018,12,19
28,Stay away from this junk hotel,"1- They charged me city tax for 2 persons 6 days while I was alone and my stay was 5 days. then when discovered this cheating in my home , I called them to refund my money they promised but till now no one gave me any attention 
2- They force me to dopiest 500 EUR for 5 days 
3- The hotel is too far from the city, noting beside you at all , it's horrible place. No Taxi available, you have to till hotel's staff to arrange taxi and you have to pay a lot because you need almost 7 KM to get out from mountains, I decided to rent car to get out from this headache, they charged me 21 EUR a day for car parking 

The bottom line this worst hotel's stay in my life",1,2018,11,24
28,Excellent Hotel,"Stunning location with amazing city and mountain views. Comfortable rooms and clean bathrooms.
Staff were exceptional in every way and in particular Maria and Roger on reception who could not have been more helpful. Trip down to the city can take some time but it is part of the overall experience.",5,2018,11,13
28,Expected more from 5 stars,"Pros
-amazing view
-the spa services by L’Occitane were great
-the jacuzzi was nice
-Very freindly and helpfull staff in restaurant and bar, seemed very genuine and eager to go the extra mile.
-beautiful lobby and inside lounge area
-the design of the room was very nice and comfortably modern
-very comfortable beds

Cons:
-Dont go here in the off-season as most outdoor areas are closed off.
-staff says it will take 15-20 min for taxi to arrive, but we waited 30-55 minutes every time so make sure you are not in a hurry.
-Hotel advertises free shuttle, but it was fullt booked our entire stay so dont count on being able to use it.
-Seems a Little run down on the outside. Tiles on our terrace were loose, the terrace in general was not very welcoming, beautiful view from Windows by bathtub, but the Windows were very dirty. We had dinner by the window in the restaurant and there were halfbroken bulbs on the stringlights blinking right in front of us for most of the dinner.
-the guest manual in our room was completely soaked and dirty for some reason. 
-Had to press button for service in the lounge bar, but I dont think the button works. 
-Nobody seems to be in charge of regularly cleaning up the pool area. I spent a couple hours there among used glasses and towels left by previous guests and didn’t see any staff come through at any time.
-Nobody cleaned our room on our second day.
-we had plans for a spa day and booked treatments, but the jacuzzi area was out of service before our appointments so the plan for cava in the jacuzzi before our massages weren’t possible.
-the food in the restaurant was ok, but you can find something far better in the city for that price.

Im sure its a lot nicer in the summer when you can take full advantage of the view, but I will stay somewhere else next time.",3,2018,10,19
28,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in,"Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel - from the moment of arrival the staff were amazing, the hotel is situated on the top of the mountain overlooking the City where the views are superb. The decor of the hotel is fantastic, we had an executive double bedroom which was enormous, the restaurants serve wonderful food and the breakfast is everyone's dream of heaven - we loved the hotel so much we could have just stayed there for our whole time relaxing by the pool or chilling in the many lounge and sitting areas - we we sad to leave but will definitely be visiting again",5,2018,10,16
28,Fantastic hotel with amazing views of Barcalona,We stayed here early October 2018 for a long weekend break. We really enjoyed our stay here. The friendly staff and luxurious surroundings made for a very relaxing stay. The hotel facilities were 5* as was the service. I would recommend this to anyone visiting the city. Don’t get put off by the out of town location - in fact this was part of the attraction. The hotel provides a free shuttle into the city and the views from the hotel are amazing. We will definitely return.,5,2018,10,08
28,Coco mat suite,"First of all, to stay here was a long time dream. This time dream happened. No rooms were available except coco mat room suite. Well done, spacious, beautiful huge bathroom with amazing shower. Room has an outstanding view. Hotel is full of charm and i think pretty unique.

But. Staff is a concern. I called the day before to ask the concierge to book me a specific restaurant in the city (apparently concierge is not a part of the team, doesn’t exist at this 5* hotel). Arrived at 1pm, made a check in, room wasn’t ready, asked during checking to book the restaurant again. Had lunch in the terrasse restaurant of the hotel which was nice and staff seem to be way better then reception. So, after lunch at 3pm (check in time) room wasn’t ready again. Got keys after 3pm. Fine. Oh yes, at 5pm asked if restaurant was booked. They said oh now they are closed, will cool when they reopen. Why didn’t you do it during lunch opening ? Or the day before when i initially asked for? So, at 6pm was asking them again, annoyed by my question lady said they were calling and they are still closed. Simply, not true. Just got busy myself doing it at exactly the sale moment. Both picked up phone. One was overbooked already one could book. Leaving room, coming to reception to ask for taxi. Guy on the reception is talking on his phone. Saw me, took my key and put ut away. Fine. I m still waiting till he noticed that i had other questions. Put down phone. I asked for taxi and he left without saying anything. So 10 min later i asked his colleague and confirmed that taxi was called but will take like 15 minutes to arrive. We were waiting for 30 mins. Taxi never arrived. Went out of the hotel to the street and saw taxi station next door with 3 free taxi standing!!!! Took one of those. Staff is chatting with themselves in front of client, joking etc. 5*? 

Ok, minor but again details to be worked on for 5* hotel, windows in the lobby bar better be cleaned as well as inox futures in the pool area.

Ah yes, jacuzzi on the suite terrasse didnt work. One of sinks wasn’t working. Water didn’t go away.

Employee keep knocking and ringing during sign don’t disturb is on the door. 

Bot that i want to be difficult. More for the management to pay more attention. And for visitors to not set expectations super high. 

Beautiful and charming hotel with outstanding view. May do your stay special if you don’t really count on staff support.

28,Charming hotel with an incredible view of the city of Barcelona from its location 350 meters above sea level.,"I had requested a terrace room with city view. Unfortunately upon arrival, the hotel was fully booked for a wedding, so we were given a terrace room on the 3rd floor which was much smaller than the one we had when we stayed before. I express my disappointment to the registration who realized that I was a returning patron and booked a room with the large terrace and told us that they will transport our luggage when it becomes available. Very pleased with their courtesy and prompt attention to my request.",5,2018,10,02
28,Short honeymoon ,"We had a short honeymoon after visiting the Maldives.
We live the hotel, the Grand Hotel Style and the breakfast.

A truly perfect and lovely experience.

We will be back and belive it is a grat stay for most people!",5,2018,10,01
28,Bones for a great hotel,"We were there for a personal retreat before returning to work.  Must say upfront that we thoroughly enjoyed the fabulous views from just about everywhere including our balcony, the infinity pool, restaurant, terraces, etc. 

About the room:
The room itself was quiet but the screams of young people in the adjacent park were non stop starting at 10 am until the park closed at night. It didn’t bother my husband but I found it annoying.  It may have been the location of our room facing the park that made it worse. It helped me to go to the park and see the children having fun. We did that on our last night; it might have helped me if we had done it a couple days earlier. 

Our bed resembled the topography of the region.
There was no coffee in the room. We travel a lot and neither of us can remember our room not having a way to prepare coffee, even if it just was instant. 
In our room, internet was weak and intermittent. 

Restaurant
They charged exorbitant prices for very mediocre food. 
We had the good fortune of having David Gonzalez serve us one night, and Christine once for brunch.  They did offer good service.  However, in general, the service was indifferent and I’d say the staff in the lap pool area need training.

The Grand La Florida has the bones for a great hotel: extraordinary views, elegant architecture, super interesting history, good location, elegant terraces, beautiful infinity and lap pool.",3,2018,09,28
28,Gorgeous spa hotel with breathtaking views,"Stunning hotel. The pool, spa and rooftop areas are unbeatable if you’re looking for total relaxation. The staff are so friendly and helpful. I had dinner on my arrival evening - the food was delicious and, although a bit pricey, the quality justified the price. The wine was delicious and reasonably priced for the quality. I would say that the hot drinks are too expensive (avoid post-dinner tea or coffee). The buffet breakfast was brilliant - loads of choice. Some people have commented on the difficulties of getting into Barcelona. I didn’t find this a problem at all. Obviously it wouldn’t be the right choice if you want to be in the heart of the action. The shuttle bus is available in the morning, returning late afternoon - no problems with availability as it was off season. On days that the Tibidabo amusement park is open, there is a direct bus from outside the hotel to Plaça de Catalunya every 20mins until around 10pm, which meant getting into Barcelona was not the slightest problem. For late evenings, a one way uber was around €16-20 - the price of a round of cocktails. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",5,2018,09,27
28,Stunning Hotel,"Best hotel I’ve stayed in to date, staff were exceptional, food was stunning! Couldn’t recommend highly enough. We booked a junior suite which overlooked Barcelona so the view was stunning. The staff went above and beyond to make the stay an exceptional experience!",5,2018,09,22
28,A Beautiful Experience!,"Imagine waking in the morning to a serene view of the  bustling City of Barcelona ; it’s architecture , the Mediterranean Sea and a clearing haze while sipping ones coffee on a private terrace! Imagine watching the city light up and twinkle at the end of the day while toasting you’re love with a glass of Cava on top of a mountain. You’ll find serenity and beauty at the Gran Hotel La Florida perched on top of Tibidabo. A lovely villa  elegantly furnished with antiques is the favorite hideaway for the international  crowd.
The staff is friendly , welcoming and professional. The restaurant offers fine cuisine along with beautiful mountain and city views. The Spa , a great place to relax. The  spacious rooms are beautifully appointed  with the finest linens and L’Ocitain toiletries.Most rooms have balconies , all have superb views. 
A truly relaxing and elegant respite awaits discerning travelers at the Gran Hotel La Florida.",5,2018,09,19
28,My 50th birthday celebrations ,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic staff who were both helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was buffet style...loads to choose from and very fresh. However, we had an evening meal...very expensive and food was not good. The hotel really need to look at their menu and prices. We would have eaten there had it not been overpriced and poor quality.
Such a shame as the bedrooms were stunning, pool was perfect and the overall feel of the hotel was wonderful. 

",3,2018,09,13
28,Staff are outstanding,"Very nice hotel overlooking Barcelona. We had two nights here and before arrival I was concerned about the location as I had asked agent for central hotel. Had we been staying longer the location may have proved a real disadvantage but because had such a limited time it was manageable. Due to delayed flight we didn't arrive at the hotel until about 10pm, the staff were great, we were told we could have a table in the restaurant as soon as we were ready. The food was good, my husband loved his steak and the octopus starter was lovely, it was very expensive but probably no more overpriced than most luxury hotels. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, at nearly thirty euros per person that would need to be some breakfast. We took the hotel shuttle down, and although reservations are recommended we had the minibus to ourselves. The parking was very expensive, we paid about forty euros for thirty six hours. The room was lovely, spacious with a great bathroom. We didn't notice any noise from the nearby theme park. The thing that particularly makes this hotel is the staff. All were really friendly and helpful, especially the chap that drove us into the city. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to use the spa.",4,2018,09,13
28,Fabulous views,"Great hotel very welcoming front of house staff who really look after you and always welcome you with a lovely smile.
Comfy spacious rooms and fabulous surroundings and views.

Disappointed with the price of drinks and food, €19 for a gin €15 for aperol spritz €6 for bottle of water main bar type meals €15 for Cesar salad and pasta dish.
Disappointed with quality of meal we had ordered pasta dish it arrived cold, sent it back same meal came back re heated ( not great when it’s seafood ) still not very warm so sent back again , no offer of complementary meal or drink , other two meals not great.

It’s a real shame as they push guests out of the hotel with the cost of drinks and snacks would have stayed around the hotel for a day but it was way too expensive.

€3 for the bus right outside the hotel , it is the fair bus however you can still pay and ride .

",4,2018,09,12
28,Very Disappointing ,"Leading Hotels of the World? Well if this is leading then we are all doomed....

Check in and front of house was pleasant and welcoming, tour of hotel and facilities was encouraging and we thought wow we have found a real gem, our superior room with terrace with stunning views over Barcelona city, what more could a couple want??? 

Well unfortunately this was as good as it got for the ‘leading hotel of the world’ 

SERVICE 
Beyond poor at times, ordered room service nothing turned up on several occasions, plenty or staff but lacked any attention to what you would expect as service, I’ve had better at budget hotels whilst on a business trip! 
No topping up of wine or water at the dinner table, ignored for most of the meal (I’ll get on to the food quality later!) and then when you offer your feedback there is no real interest or concern and just smile and walk off! 

FOOD
Poor is being kind, meals sent back, steak that an amateurish chief could cook better, pasta dish that was an abomination of a meal, food served teppid warm, bread that was harder than a rock!!! And that was an evening meal. During the day the food on offer was bland and tasteless and all in all big during the day and evening very limited bland food on offer backed up by poor delivery of said food and poor service.... BUT STILL VERY EXPENSIVE 

The Hotel
Our room was gorgeous, not cheap but was worth it so no complaints about that and credit where credit is due (seen other posts about lesser rooms that look poor though) 
The rest of the hotel, in the main looks good until you dig a bit deeper, the external lounging area, the cushions are covered in old food and dirty. Spa toilets flushers done work in some of the toilets (some people must have found out after leaving a deposit) and some doors don’t lock.
Jacuzzi was not very warm, we did ask them to increase the temp but, you can guess the outcome of that! 
Around the front of house reception etc hotel was very nice and well presented but on the whole the hotel needs some money spent to back up the ‘5star’ cost!!!!

Summary
- Amazing views
- Superior room was very nice (part from two single beds pushed together)
- Food very poor and limited options
- Service very average at its best
- Very expensive but nothing to support this in terms of quality on offer
- Should look into employing an actual chef ? (Just my view) 
- Hotel Needs investment 
- Would not return 
- stayed 5 nights, wanted to leave after 2, lucky Barcelona is an amazing city with lots of options! 
- Been to many LHW branded hotels and this is not leading on any level with the exception of the view! 

Ventured out to hotel 1898, Mirabe restaurant and many others and could not speak highly enough of the level of service or food quality and options, this hotel should go experience them and then try what they offer! 
",2,2018,08,28
28,Very Disappointing ,"Theme park directly next to the hotel which is very very noisy and disturbing!Terrible service, food menu very basic and of very poor quality especially for a hotel that claims to be part of LHW. The views are what make this place but nothing more unfortunately. The room we had was lovely, clean and what we expected. Spa toilets were very dirty, smelly and some of the doors don’t shut or even lock, and the jacuzzi was luke warm not hot. The outside furniture needs a good wash! F&B staff speak minimal English and just wander around and are not attentive at all. Very very expensive food and drink considering it’s of bad quality, not value for money at all. Location for us was good as it’s out of the way, although there is one shuttle to the centre at 11am and one back at 6ish so you are limited without a car or using a taxi. Taxi is €40-50 round trip so gets expensive although we didn’t mind to get some good grub! Pool is nice, little cold however no atmosphere, no music or anything about it that makes it that enjoyable. Full of children which for a boutique hotel in the middle of no where is ridiculous. It is not kitted up for children at all and so they are running around screaming and splashing as there is nothing else to do for them here. The food quality is the biggest downfall here, I had to send a meal away it was that bad. The mini bar is extremely expensive, charging €4 plus euros for a handful of nuts they give you free with your drinks at the pool. We made the best of our stay, but would not return due to all of the above. I have in another LHW hotel and this one could not compare! I think LHW should think twice about having this hotel as part of their high class chain!!
",2,2018,08,28
28,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for a 4 night break last week and will most probably return in the future. From the personal check-in with a glass of cava, to the beautiful room everything was seamless. We booked a terrace suite, which had stunning views of the city and a huge luxury bathroom. The metal pool lovely and always quite quiet. The hotel is about 30 minutes by car or taxi from the city, which isn't a problem as long as you're prepared to travel in, there is also a courtesy shuttle bus that runs twice daily. The only small downside is the restaurant is quite expensive compared to many places in the city.   ",4,2018,08,28
28,Beautiful location but a dated yet very expensive hotel with rude staff,"We booked this 5* hotel for a luxury break in August with my friend. The location is very remote and the hotel has incredible views but I would say that the hotel itself is quite dated, and the rooms are not 5*. If you are prepared to spend a fortune dining in the hotel then it is an ideal luxury getaway, however we found the food to be average and not worth the extortionate prices - eg 28 euros for a continental breakfast and 7 euros for one coffee!

We found the hotel staff to be incredibly rude - our check in experience was awful. We had informed the hotel we would be arriving at 1pm and we arrived at 1:15. The receptionist told us the maid was cleaning our room currently so we would have to wait 30 minutes. After an hour we returned and asked if our room was ready and he informed us she had only just starting cleaning our room so we had to wait (so he had lied). We got into our room an hour and a half later after the staff member rudely dropped the keys into my lap and walked off. Not a 5* experience! We then found our room to have a dodgy lock and the air conditioning was not working. When we called a staff member he found that the air conditioning was switched off at the fusebox and said that we should have known to turn it on there instead of calling a member of staff- what a joke!  

Furthermore, it cost us 45 euros from the airport and around 35-40 euros every time we took a taxi into the city. The hotel shuttle is not very helpful as it only runs twice - at 11 am and 6pm. The local bus was better but it is a long-winded process. 

In summary; if you have lots of money to spend and are not bothered about seeing much of the city, then this is a great hotel. If not I would say you can achieve the same level of luxury for much less at the Melia Sky Hotel which is definitely a more 5* experience where I will be returning in future.",3,2018,08,27
28,Beautiful hotel! ,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and it is such a lovely hotel! It is out of the city centre but there is a bus right outside that drops you straight into the main square of the city for €3 which is pretty regular! A taxi is anywhere from €20-€25! We stayed in the junior suite with a terrace and city view, the room was gorgeous and views were breathtaking. We spent one of our days round the pool which was also great! The staff were all very friendly and offered wonderful service from the moment we stepped into the hotel. The only thing I would say is that food and drink is expensive so be prepared to pay a bit more than you would usually but other than that would definitely recommend!! ",5,2018,08,08
28,Great boutique hotel,This hotel is above Barcelona but worth traveling that little further.  The service is good the staff are polite and extremely helpful.  The rooms a clean and well proportioned and the bed is very comfortable.  Well worth booking !!,5,2018,08,06
28,What a disappointment! ,"We booked this hotel one night before a flight the next day. We wanted a bit of rest before the flight and thought this spa hotel outside the city would be the perfect end of a long vaccation. But it was all a disaster and nothing like the pictures on their webpage. 

Its started with a 40 min wait just to check in. I dont know How it is possible only to have One person at the service desk for such a big hotel. Lots of people were waiting in line before us. 

Well in the room it smelled terrible, like the room had not been used for years. The walls were dirty and in much need of a proper paintwork. Interior was dated and very worn. Even the towels were worn and grey. The only plus was the good size bathroom and a nice view of Barcelona. 

The pool area and terrasses were very crowded and far from peaceful. Lots of turists busses stopped right outside the hotel by the outdoor pool area. 

We parked our car by the entrance and needed to hand in the key. When we came to pick it up to go for dinner we waited again for a really long tine by the reception but nobody came. 

This hotel is in much need of a proper management and a great interior designer to bring it in to this century. ",2,2018,07,23
28,Top notch hotel. Will be back 100%,"Top notch location, service and views. This hotel is on top of the hills overlooking Barcelona. The outdoors area with the stainless steel pool has views to Barcelona as well. The staff is top notch at all levels. I will definitely come back here again",5,2018,07,09
28,Disappointing!,"We booked the 'Love Actually' package to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary which included a one night stay, welcome drink, dinner and breakfast for 530 €. It was a Sunday which maybe made a difference but there was no welcome drink, in fact beyond a normal check-in procedure, no welcome at all. My wife who had arrived before me was not shown to her room but just given the keys, she took the brunch menu (30€+) but had to pay extra for the coffee (a bit penny pinching). The package which clearly stated dinner in their Barcalonas restaurant was closed but we were shown to the terrace which was very nice but the 'Tasting Menu' included in out package was awful. Mozzarella sprinkled with chopped roated vegtables, followed by a piece of tuna that was overcooked and so dry we had one mouthful each, but the 120g (bit small) rib-eye steak, roasted baby potatoes and 3 slices of mushroom was tasty and good, then a choice of desserts from their menu. Frankly, a really unimaginative menu and certainly not worth the money.
Breakfast is good and can be enjoyed on the terrace and the food and beverage staff were all very pleasant.
Check-out on the Monday morning, was full of apologies and there was no hesitation to take another 87€ for justifiable extras. Really wasn't looking for compemsation but maybe take a few euros off the outstanding balance or give us the bottle of Cava that was next to the desk for 'Welcome Drinks' .... yet again, a lack of thought.
There is no question that this hotel's location is excellent with great views of the city but without that I think this hotel would struggle (if it isn't already).
It's a bit tired (room furniture a bit battered and some stains on cushions), living on a luxurious past and there are much better 5-Star hotels in the city that offer better value for money. What a shame.",2,2018,07,09
28,Still a personal favorite,"WE have been staying at this hotel since shortly after it opened back in 2003.  We recently revisited and overall our impressions have been very positive.  On previous visits, we were not very impressed with the breakfast buffet nor with the gastronomic restaurant.  However, this year, the hotel has clearly upgraded their kitchen staff and taken into account past criticisms.  The gourmet restaurant was excellent, the quality of foods top notch, and the service very good.  Engaging if you wanted to engage, and leaving you alone if you wanted a quiet private dinner.  Also, breakfast and the poolside food has been much improved.  Really very good quality and absolutely no complaints.  My compliments to the management for these improvements.  The physical property is first class and certainly a go-to destination.  You want your guests to come all the way to the top of Tibidabo with its spectacular views, and then stay and enjoy the facilities.  We will definitely be back again.  En hora buena!",4,2018,07,07
28,Amazing,"Absolutely stunning hotel located in the hills overlooking Barcelona. Staff were great - friendly and helpful.
The views were amazing.
The room was of a very high standard and would highly recommend. Hopefully will be back again soon.",5,2018,07,04
28,WOW!,"This hotel is by far one of the most unique hotels I have been to. Situated high up on the mountain, you get them ost majestic views of Barcelona, the sea and the surrounding mountains. Definitely a must visit",5,2018,07,03
28,Amazing,"Myself and my brother visited, first time abroad alone. Hotel was extremely welcoming ( even when we forgot to pay the bar bill!) Would highly recommend. Swimming pool was slightly cold so may not be ideal for young children.",5,2018,06,16
28,Big disappointment!,"I stayed at Gran Hotel La Florida with my parents earlier this month. Looking at their website we were looking for to it: what a big disappointment when we saw the bedrooms! Whereas the staff that took care of us when we arrived was very nice (the receptionists and the valets), the bedroom did not match what we saw on the website: they show an amazing view on the city, we barely saw it between the 2 walls! Food was correct. However, the establishment was very beautiful and the pool (even if we couldn't use because of a technical problem) was splendid.",2,2018,06,13
28,Fantastic views,"We decided to stay here on the last few days of our trip to unwind a bit from the city. First driving up here we thought damn this is far. Pulling up to the hotel it didn't look like much but once inside your jaw drops. It is a magnificent looking hotel. 

All the staff are very cordial and professional. We were given a tour of the facilities and it was most definitely impressive. Our room was impressive. We had a corner room with views of the city and ocean. Very spacious room and bed and bathroom with l'occitane toiletries. 

Now the negative part of the hotel. We were here for only 2 days before flying back. On our last day we woke up bright and early to lay outside and use the pool. About an hour into laying we decided to take a dip and noticed that the pools were barricaded. We were then informed that the pools would be closed for the entire day due to cleaning and maintenance. This was Such a disappointment and a let down. Couldn't this have been done the prior night after the pool closing hours?! Their compensation was no better at all. They said we can use a sister hotel's pool but we would have to manage transportation getting there. The other disappointment is its restaurant Barcelona. You can read my reviews on it 

Pros
- Fantastic views
- Indoor/outdoor pools 
- Jacuzzi and saunas
- Friendly staff
- spacious rooms 

Cons
- Restaurant Barcelona
- a little pricey
- far from everything
- How the pool situation was handled",3,2018,06,11
28,Nice stay,"We visited this hotel for a wedding and were impressed. It’s a little ways from the city but the views are great. The hotel was nicer than I anticipated, and the service was on point. They upgraded us to a larger room with a huge balcony. Turn down service was nice. Great for a couple days to relax and get away from the city. The only cons were the shower didn’t have a slope so water went everywhere. Also, they use real keys which were obnoxious to carry around and should  be replaced with electronic ones. ",4,2018,05,28
28,So so,"The Grand Hotel L Florida is situated on the hills around Barcelona, the views from the hotel are amazing.
The staff is ok but the restaurant staff are very nice and friendly and they give a high quality service.
The breakfast is ok.
However the pool are not so nice, the water in the Jacuzzi and in the main pool is not clean that's the reason for my low score.",3,2018,05,23
28,Views from the room are incredible!,"I loved this hotel! If you don't mind the drive to the top, which is quite a bit....

28,If I could Award 6 Stars I Would,"Wow - what an amazing experience! 
I would love to live there!
Absolutely everything was beyond perfect.
My room was huge with so many nice touches and views to die for. 
When I arrived I was greeted by Giselle - A wonderful young lady just so cheerful! 
The facilities were all simply unreal. 
Make sure to use the spa and ask for Mireia - I had the most incredible pedicure! 
Overall, one of the best hotels I have been to...
Congrats to all the staff that make this hotel remarkable. 
Can't wait to come back very soon.",5,2018,05,20
28,Outstanding ,"We booked a short notice deal for this hotel, so we didn’t have time to really research the location etc. I looked at a few trip advisor reviews good and bad. Let me put your mind at ease, it’s is worth the hype, the views are stunning, the staff are helpful and friendly, Roger explained the transport system so well that we had the confidence to try it, I’m so grateful as it saved us money and gave a new dimension to Barcelona, Louis operated the shuttle and gave us a nice call to remind us he leaving in 15 minutes, informed us of where the pick up for the return would be, also dropped us near park Guell when we went there for a trip. The swimming pool is amazing with outdoor bar and superb views, I spent most of the time in the jacuzzi, they’re some workout equipment and a gym. The room we stayed in on the third floor (307) has views of the city, fantastic sunrises and sunsets, floor to ceiling glass doors that open on to a little balcony, the bathroom has a bath and separate shower, toilet and a bidet. The room had a sense of opulence that matched the views. The bed was one of the most comfiest beds I’ve ever slept in, the tv was in Spanish except for the odd show, you can put a usb in the tv if you want to watch your own films. Every day the room was cleaned immaculately and a nice quality chocolate was left on the bed. 

We ordered room service and it was also in keeping with the grandeur of the hotel, it was so tasty I could’ve ate it twice, it is on the costly side at €25 for the fish, however it did taste amazing. 

Transport

From the airport a taxi cost us €37.

The hotel does operate a free “shuttle” which effectively is a seven seater, BOOK early! We didn’t have a problem getting a seat and it is so helpful for getting into town. 

Public transport is fun and easy to navigate. The bus that stops outside the hotel is the 111, which will take you to a Cable car (Funnicular de Vallvidrera) that takes you down to the train station. I would suggest you walk to the cable car at least once as the views are unbelievable, the walk is about 20-30 minutes depending on stops, which you will stop many times to take pictures and wonder why the picture doesn’t do it justice. At the cable car station it’s best to buy a T-10 ticket, we were only going to La Rambla and Plaça de Catalunya so we got a Zone 1, we only needed one ticket as there were only two of us, the T-10 ticket allows you to travel ten journeys on the train or bus, a journey is 1hour 15minutes so if you get off multiple times it only counts after the 1:15hrs. The S1 or S2 went straight to La Rambla and took about 15-20 minutes depending on stops. When coming back the platform was always platform 3 or 4, but there was always a train at platform 3.

",5,2018,05,18
28,Our stay before our Mediterranean Cruise ,"What a beautiful hotel with great amenities.  We were greeted by Louis from the beginning. We were given a tour of the hotel and then time to explore on our own after we were shown our room. The plush beds were amazing and turned back every night.  

Anything we asked for it was there in no time.  Not to mention the great recommendations for our stay.  Louis set us up for an amazing ride downtown for dinner and a private setting for amazing Tapas.  We were treated like royalty all because Louis called ahead and scheduled the whole experience. 

Every thing was on point and wish we had more time to just stay and enjoy the hotel as much as we enjoyed everything else. 

Thanks to all the staff for all your hospitality.  Our experience was a definite 5 star rating!!",5,2018,05,14
28,"Five star view, one star service","First of all, the views from the hotel are spectacular so it’s worth a visit for that alone.  

The hotel facilities are very good, with spacious and well furnished common areas, pool, rooms and bathrooms.

The quality and range of food at the bar and restaurants are ‘ok’ but definitely room for improvement.

With the exception of Juan at the bar, the  service is shockingly bad for a supposed ‘leading hotel’.  

- Check in is at 3pm and we arrived at 12.30, so we could understand the room not being ready.  The front desk said they would put a priority on our room and let us know when it was ready, but it wasn’t ready until 3.30, after we had gone to reception to ask on status

- We also booked treatments one evening only to be called at the actual time of the booking to be told they were running 40 minutes behind.  This conflicted with our dinner plans so obviously we weren’t happy - front desk’s response was ‘Its not our fault.  Perhaps you can shorten your treatment.’  The fact that they tried to charge us for the late cancellation is just ridiculous.

- As an apology, they left cava in our room, however we didn’t get back from dinner until 11 and we’re leaving the next day, so that went to waste

- At the hotel, we were encouraged to watch el Classico at the Luna bar however after staying for 15 minutes we gave up as there was no bartender

- We didn’t have turndown service or water in our room.  And we had to call reception for a hair dryer, which duly took 15 minutes to arrive

- And then to top it off, when we ordered a taxi for the airport, we were told it would take 5 minutes, but it took 25 minutes. I appreciate this isn’t the hotels fault, but it just sums up the whole experience.

So in summary, it’s a beautiful hotel and the views are spectacular, but be prepared for bad service.  If you want my advice, for the same price you can stay at the Arts hotel and visit this one for a meal.

28,"breath taking view, but room for improvement","Our sea view suite ...as well as from the terrace ....offers a breath taking view over Barcelona towards the sea. Beautiful room with a great comfortable shower. 

The people at the reception were extremly friendly from the welcome to our good bye after three nights. Everything arround breakfast, however has been really dissappointing. Loud, cold very unfriendly seating staff ....we gave up waiting for our Cappuccino after 25min .....so for real breakfast celebraters like we are ....you better skip unless you want to be totally frustrated.",4,2018,05,06
28,Beware of Management using your personal information,"As 5-star Hotels go, the Manager of this hotel is definitely not trained or equipped to deal with Luxury travelers. My daughter and I stayed there, and my daughter wrote a negative review, due to an experience we had with the Manager. As you will see on TripAdvisor, the Manager responded to the review by making personal threats, stating she had all of our personal information from our reservation, and would use it to track us down and hurt us. Not only is this illegal to take peoples private information off of a confidential reservation, and use it for personal reasons..... It is also considered black-male and extortion. 

Beware of paying 5-star prices, for then, the head of the hotel to launch personal vendetta’s, simply because you were open about your experience with her professional management. We now have hired a lawyer to explore these threats and report them to the Hotel ownership. It is unfortunate because this is otherwise a beautiful setting and upscale environment. It is just that the management is more or less run by what seems more like a gang mentality. 

The response to my daughters review by the manager was shocking and I am surprised the manager would post it for the public and her superiors to see.....When we were there they privately abused us, and now it is publicly confirmed in her response. This, proving our point to begin with. Seems she walked into her own trap-",1,2018,05,05
28,WOW There are no other words to describe this 5 star hotel and staff and views!!,"A wonderful hotel worthy of all its 5 stars.  Its position, the views, such helpful attentive staff from front desk, restaurant to housekeeping.  A special mention to Inigo Pontabella who was so so helpful so much infact I thought he was going to be our guide on our days out, he provided so much useful information.  The pool is wonderful and much used by my two boys 11 and 13 and their 20 year old cousin.  The bedrooms are lovely again the view is the selling point.  The beds are enormous big enough for 3.  Although 3 boys did not want to sleep in the same bed so the hotel provided a z bed.  I think Europe do not seem to do triple bedrooms, i.e 3 single beds in a room.  The breakfasts were superb and loads of choice.  We ate in the hotel 3 out of 4 nights and the food although pricey was wonderful.  Bear in mind the euro is the same price as the pound and this is a 5 star hotel in the city.  There are no other places to eat up in the mountains for dinner at this time of the year.  When the summer season  gets going there is a restaurant 5 mins away outside the Tibado Amusement park which was open up to 6 pm.  There is also a local bus again that runs more regularly during the summer season too and may be a bit cheaper than a taxi into the center of Barcelona.  As we were 5 people taxis were better value.  The hotel shuttle bus is really nice to offer but we were unable to use it as it was full but it is nice its there if you book it early enough.
We would love to come back again and if I had any tips for the hotel to consider would be the following:
Tea and coffee making facilities in the bedrooms
A pillow menu (or choice in the bedroom)
A childrens menu in the restaurant
Binoculars to hire from the front desk for those amazing views (forgot to bring ours)
Other than that I wouldnt change a thing it is an amazing hotel and the only place I would ever want to stay when visiting Barcelona!",5,2018,05,04
28,View is ICONIC,"The view off the city off Barcelona from the mountain is fantastic. The first time we were there it was foggy ( so we did not enjoy ) so much but during our second stay it was fantastic.

One off the best and coolest pools off the world",5,2018,05,04
28,Fantastic views and service,"The view from the hotel over Barcelona and sea beyond is amazing. Excellent service and amenities at the hotel are first class. Definitely a place for a few days of quiet R&R, although the city centre isn't too far away and the hotel provides a free shuttle service.

Rooms are very spacious and nicely done. Indoor and outdoor pools and spa facilities are modern and clean. The wireless call bells next to each sun lounger also make ordering drinks and food very easy! 

Would certainly recommend and will return too.",5,2018,05,02
28,Five Star View,"One of the most spectacular views you will ever have.Upgraded to a terrace room with a sea view(Highly recommended)Awesome room with a view to die for.Probably the best welcoming reception I have ever experienced at a hotel.Amazing.Would rate it 5 Star If not for a couple of things.I would rate the food a 2.Not only does it not live up to the rest of the hotel.But it is way overpriced.Had a couple of things that needed to be fixed in the room,we called,and they never showed up.A special thank you to the gentlemen who brought us our room service dinner.He was incredible.And to the young lady who escorted us to our table each morning for breakfast.Your smiling face was a great way to start the day.Pool is awesome.Hot tub is great.Would love to visit again,but unless the food improves,that will not happen.What a shame.",4,2018,04,29
28,Incredible views and great staff ,"We loved this hotel and will almost certainly stay there again when we next visit Barcelona. The views across the city and the Med are amazing, the staff couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful, and the buses to and from the centre were plentiful and on time! Barcelona is one city where there is so much to see and do that you really don’t need to stay in the city centre.  For all of these reasons, I’d thoroughly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,04,19
28,Fabulous,"I stayed with my husband and nine year old son for a week and we had a fabulous time. The hotel is immaculately clean with fabulous facilities including pool and spa area. The staff could not be more helpful they were truly excellent, I couldn’t fault the hotel and level of service particularly when travelling with a young child it is always nice when they are made to feel welcome.",5,2018,04,16
28," Most romantic view of the city ","The hotel was build in 1920th, the history is  amazing. Hemingway stayed there. The  view is priceless, the rooms are big(40-50m), personal is very helpful, and a swimming pool as well very stylish. 
Place for a romantic escape. ",5,2018,04,15
28,Terrible Management !!,"This hotel has the most barbaric and irresponsible manager, Cristina. I stayed there and tried reaching her after I left for 5 days straight. Her under managers were so unprofessional after me having a traumatic experience that I needed to report. I paid 5 star prices to stay at a professionally run place and this place and its management staff were like third world. The owners of the hotel should know because it is a nice setting and their low class unprofessional management absolutely ruined it all. Cristina should be ashamed.",1,2018,04,14
28,Easter Treat,"After a recommendation from a friend, who visits this hotel every year, I booked a 4 night break here for my sister and I. 
We arrived late circa 11pm, Lucas at Reception was warm and welcoming and a glass of cava on arrival was much appreciated. A beautiful aroma subtly wafts, you will notice as soon as you enter the lobby.
The room was not disappointing, generously sized, with the most comfortable beds ever and a bathroom big enough to clean a family of 5 in one go! The hotel must have the best views of Barcelona city so drawing the curtains that first morning was an exciting event. Breakfast is stunning and there is an impressive array of hot or cold breakfast choices. We loved the locally sourced honey, fruits and yoghurts and the lemon and pistachio cake. After a full day sightseeing, we were happy to return to the sanctuary of the hotel in the evening and enjoy dinner. We found the brasserie fairly priced for an evening meal. As it was my birthday, we visited Barcelonas restaurant on our last evening. Luciano and Xenia were fantastic, recommending dishes and wine, we even had a visit to the table from the Chef that evening. With the city twinkling below, it was a memorable evening with flawless but friendly service and impeccable attention to detail. 
The hotel is some half hour from the city by bus. The bus stop to town, if you miss the free hotel transport is right outside the hotel, catch the T2B to Place Catalunya. The bus leaves from the same place just beyond the Apple store on the next corner. E3 for two people. Make time to use the stunning spa area with sauna, crystal clear pool and jacuzzi. Take your slippers and robe! There is also L’Occitane treatment room and shop. 
My sister and I commented how unobtrusive the Housekeeping team were. You never saw them, but everything was super clean, beds turned down, chocolates, even a ‘birthday tray’ which was very thoughtful.  We loved the interior of this hotel, home from home with beautiful private corners to sit and relax. Being up on the hill away from the sprawl of the city is a bonus, it allows you space to breathe and appreciate the panoramic vistas. We could have stayed longer! ",5,2018,04,11
28,Amazing views and splendid stay,The hotel has a stunning views of Barcelona. The staff is kind and the service is great. The room is lovely and spacious. The spa area is great. I will come back in summer time to enjoy the outdoor swimming pool. The relation between quality and price is accurate and I tink it's worth the money.,4,2018,04,11
28,Poor and overrated.,"We were rather excited about this place - the views are indeed astounding but the hotel is just not up to scratch. Slow, lazy and almost rude staff who were hopelessly untrained, mediocre ludicrously expensive food and drinks, misleading room photos: the mountain view with terrace was actually a view of the car park - fortunately after complaining they moved us to a 4th floor city view which was better, but even so the rooms are tired and damaged. If, like us, you looked at this place and thought it would be “wow” - please rethink your trip and stay elsewhere. A very disappointing and ultimately expensive weekend.",2,2018,04,10
28,Not a good experience ,"Service not good. Arrived to the hotel in a taxis and no one to greet us and found it very difficult to find the hotel entrance.
The shuttle bus they offer is absolutely shocking. It takes only 7 people. In a hotel of 70 rooms  that's all they can offer. The reception staff was very rude and kept telling me it was complimentary infact he told me 3 times, like it was a great favour he was doing for me.
In the restaurant the service is very very slow, and being a vegetarian /vegan not a great choice of foods. Very difficult as there are no other restaurants nearby.
Ordered a pasta dish with vegetables. Tasted like it has tomato ketchup. Extra portion of vegetable was charged at 12 euros, a small ball of cheese was 12 euros.
Prices not justified with the quality of food and service. ",1,2018,04,08
28,Amazing views. Quality Rooms,"Our first time in Barcelona began with our arrival at this beautiful hotel, on the hillside, overlooking this amazing city. Because we arrived out of season, we took a bus from Playa de Catalina, the main square in the city. The hotel is about 10km from the city centre. It’s uphill all the way, so its not an easy or casual walk. But dont let that put you off. It’s worth every penny of the £3 bus fare or the £25 taxi. The views on the road up to the hotel are breathtaking. A completely different experience of Barcelona to anyone who stays in the city centre. Arrival at the hotel was met by a conscierge and a cold glass of sparkling Cava. Amazing!! Easy check in, shown around and directed to our room. And WHAT a room it was. 5th floor, overlooking the snow capped mountains. Stunning!! The room and maid service was top quality. Little touches like a small chocolate on the pillow at night time, really made our trip special. Staff were excellent everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast is buffet style, continental, cereals, bacon and sausages. Great start to the day. Used the pools (infinity pool is a real treat with spectacular views), but the jacuzzi was a bit cool. But with so much to see, jacuzzi time wasn’t top of our list of things to do! Our only complaint is the price of drinks. Small beer was £6 each, large beers were £10 each. It didn’t bother us, because we spent almost all of our time in the city. Behind the hotel (5 mins easy walk) is a small kids theme park and an absolutely stunning church. From here, you can take a mountain railway tram to the foot of the hills. Brilliant fun. Great experience. If you are going to Barcelona, try this hotel for something a little bit special.",5,2018,04,05
28,Birthday of my boyfriend ,"I would like to say a big thanks to hotel staff and in particular to Guest Relations - Roger Sunyer!
You made my boyfriend's birthday more than special!
Thank you for solving the payment problem with my credit card and for reacting so quickly and organizing the surprise! 
You're the best!
Thanks!
Avgustina Stancheva ",5,2018,04,04
28,Like staying in an inspiring museum ,"The hotel is beautiful with so many interesting object d’art and art nouveau touches to discover. The infinity pool is gorgeous and the terraces are an ideal spot to enjoy the view. Bed was comfy, bathroom facilities spot on, and breakfast was amongst the best I’ve had - especially the fresh-from-the-hive honeycomb! Only down sides for us was the lack of promised shuttle bus to the city which meant we had to pay for taxis in and out of the city at 20e each way; the drinks and food is very expensive as you’d expect in a hotel but seemed excessively so when compared to the same even on Las Ramblas; and on three different occasions we had items appear on our bill which we hadn’t had. Each time they were removed without fuss, but a less keen eye would have forked out even more than necessary! Nice touches such as Cava on arrival and slippers and robes on bathroom made it feel really luxurious. Would definitely return 🤩",4,2018,03,29
28,Great hotel for business meetings,"The hotel is the perfect place for a relaxed, productive business meeting. The meeting room offers a private terrace (could also be used e.g. for cocktail receptions) and provides great connectivity. So far, we have never managed to not have any breakdowns during the meeting. The rooms was well prepared and even short notice requests have been taken into consideration. Only thing to improve: a Nespresso coffee machine in the meeting room. The business lunches are varied, light and delicious and the service is great. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. We very much enjoyed the stay and I can only recommend the hotel.",5,2018,03,22
28,'Great hotel with amazing view',"Barcelona😍
We take taxi from airport to hotel.After 25 minutes we arrived at the hotel and the price for ride was 35e and that is very good.In front of the hotel was  kind bellboy,who took over our suitcases and directed us to the reception.At the reception they offered us a champagne while we waited on the check-in.The hotel was booked a month ago via booking.com and everything has already been payd from my account.However, the hotel has its own rules and one of them is that you must pay a deposit of 100 € for each night at the hotel, and if you stay for 5 days you have to pay 500e.That deposit is served in the case you use restaurant,mini bar in room,massage or some other thing's from hotel.It did not make any sense to me because it is not possible to avoid paying a bill from a restaurant ,mini bar or some other thing's all that is normal to put on room acaunt and last day whan is check out you will pay your bills.That's why I refused to pay that deposit and said that I will pay a maximum of 100e because I don't want to think if the hotel has returned these money to my account and can not wait for banks to process it because it can last 1 to 10 days.Finally manager come and said that its all okay and we only paid 100e .We are in the delux room on the 4th floor with a wonderful view of the whole Barcelona😍In the room there is also a mini bar but the prices are a bit too big but ok.The bathroom is perfect, large, with shower, bath and large mirror.There is no ironing board, hair dryer, and tea boiler in the room.It is likely that your hotel staff can fulfill many wishes but only to say that it was not in the room as in the 5 star hotels.From the hotel to the city center you have more ways to come,such as a taxi, a mini bus or a tram that is a few kilometers from the hotel but again you have to take a taxi or a bus to come in centar.We used taxi to go to town and return.The price was for one direction 20 e and that is great and very simply for better holidays.And finally my recommendation is for everyone to choose this hotel and you will not be disappointed in the selection.Just pay attention to the prices in the mini bar and in the restaurant.The food is very good but the portions are small but the tastes can not be discussed because we are not all the same.I soon return to Barcelona  and  I will choose this hotel again because in the end we had a wonderful vacation in the beautiful city.❤
",4,2018,03,12
28,The view from Gran Hotel is spectacular,"We had our offsite up in the hills outside city center of Barcelona. Perfect if you want to get away from the hustle and have an amazing view. Mzke sure to get a room with a balcony facing the city. The rooms are old style and big. The service is a bit slow and the food could be better in a place like this. 

Did not use the pool, but it is pretty small and the pool area is a bit worn down. Take a nice walk to the cathedral, watch the sunset and take the funicular up/down. 

The ride from the airport was about 30 min and from the hotel into the city about 15-20 minutes. This is a hotel for conference and romantic getaways and maybe not so much for families with kids or if you look for nightlife Barcelona.",5,2018,03,05
28,Sells itself as a luxury hotel but average service and style,"We stayed here for a weekend break as a family with teenagers. The hotel has a wonderful location looking over the city and in the summer heat it was nice to escape and chill by the pool as Barcelona is very hot in the summer . However the service is really slow and the quality of the food also is not up to the price or what a hotel such as this, which is selling itself as grand luxury, should be serving up. The pool area has not enough seats and hardly any in the shade so you really need to fight to get that early - the pool area itself feels worn down and a bit dirty. It could be amazing but feels a bit unpleasant somehow. Plus a lot of locals just seem to appear and order a drink and go for a swim but are not staying in the hotel which is quite insulting when you pay so much to stay here. The rooms are also a bit out of date and the whole place needs modernisation and better trained staff.",3,2018,03,01
28,WOW,Amazing-a real wow-couldn't believe the luxury and the staff-service was outstanding The rooms amazing with luxury bathrobes and endless towels available. The swimming pool is outstanding and the view is breathtaking. The only negative issue is that the free bus shuttle is only restricted to certain times in the day and had to depend on public transport-we were not notified that the bus service stops running after 10pm and had to walk from the lift to the hotel as there was no other option available,5,2018,02,27
28,Amazing Place,"I brought my other half here as a Valentine’s surprise and it did not disappoint. Staff were very helpful answering my queries before we came and they ensured that we were given a superb room (301) which gave us exceptional views of the city from our balcony. The staff were also more than willing to call cabs for us and make restaurant reservations which was a nice touch. The hotel itself was spotless and nice and quiet too. Drink in the bar were a little expensive, however that’s a small price to pay for a fantastic hotel.

In regards to travel distances (as this is what I struggled to get a definitive answer on), from the airport to the hotel was about a half hour journey which cost about 30 euros. And from the hotel into the city cost between 15-20 euros and took about 15-20 minutes. 

I’d definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,02,23
28,Amazing ,"Went there to celebrate my Birthday. We got a room on the last floor with amazing view in Montseny mountains, also could see all barcelona and the sea! Beautiful! Comfy room!

28,Like from a Wes Anderson's movie,"I didn’t happen to get to know Ernest Hemingway, George Sanders or the prince of Belgium personally, but something tells me they had a great taste, at least when it came to choosing hotels. 

Words cannot describe what a special experience and honor it was to be an artist in residence at The Gran Hotel La Florida, where we were warmly welcomed with my husband and our two 5-year-old daughters. 

The Gran Hotel La Florida located at the iconic destination is actually a destination itself, which, I must warn you, creates a dilemma since you just don’t wanna leave it for the city, especially that it’s hard to imagine a better view upon Barcelona than from Tibidabo. We spent hours contemplating the breathtaking dawns and sunsets over the city stretching into the blue of the Mediterranean. That said, I would highly recommend anyone staying at this hotel to reserve a day or two to enjoy the venues and the surroundings!

Even though Tibidabo is fairly remote from the city center, or let’s put it correctly, well above the city center, the guests of the hotel can benefit a free shuttle bus plying all the mornings and evenings. Personally, I totally enjoyed such a secluded location as it helps to create a more intimate bond with the city. 
 
The almost century-long history of The Gran Hotel La Florida hotel speaks through its walls and interiors - it is in the air. There are hotels where the atmosphere is artificially created through details and items, whilst here it is innate. Even though the venues are immaculate and well-groomed, you just feel there is a story behind them, and it’s intriguing. Pair this ambiance with the on-site library featuring a thorough selection of rare books, fireplace, and a tea room, and you risk to miss your flight back home ;) 

Our two-storey family room was spacious and light, all in woody and homey palette, while the shower cabin could easily fit another family :) My everyday ritual was doing my morning pages as Barbara Sher suggests in her book ‘The Artist’s Way’. Well, if every artist had a chance to work while taking a bath in an extravagant bathroom of malachite color, the pursuit of inspiration would be solved once and for all!
Apparently, back home I will have to learn cooking pink mini-burgers that my daughters would tuck into every breakfast and the delicious omelet that I and my husband could never miss even after promising ourselves to try something new every day :P 

Last but not least, the hotel is kid-friendly and seeing my daughters running around in those cute bathrobes made the mom’s heart melt. Such a tiny detail but will stay in our memory for long!

Overall, everything was amazing about this stay: the staff, the venues, the food, the views, the books, the room. It just felt like a never-ending festivity where everything was enough and nothing was in excess. 

Thank you to all the staff members for making it such!",5,2018,02,02
28,Fantastic Hotel ,"Me and my partner have spent the last 5 nights in the Gran Hotel La Florida and all we can say is it's fantastic! 
From the moment we checked in we were greeted with exceptional standards. The staff were absolutely brilliant and so welcoming. 
We chose this hotel not just because of it's 5* rating but from the reviews of the previous customers, they were not wrong this hotel has the most amazing views over Barcelona!!! 
The hotel has this rustic chic charm about it, with the comforts of home! 
Our suite was spacious and comfy and we found we had been upgraded when we arrived, the bed was out of this world, at 8 months pregnant I wasn't sure I was going to sleep but I slept like a baby (no pun intended).
We also celebrated our anniversary while in Barcelona and the hotel put complimentary champagne and strawberries in our suite on our return which was a lovely touch. 
Everything about our stay was just perfect and we will be staying here again when we return to Barcelona. 
For now though we would just like to thank all the staff at the hotel for making our stay memorable. ",5,2018,02,02
28,Perfect stay at Gran La Florida Hotel,"Birthday celebration -  My 1 night stay at The Gran La Florida was amazing.  Rustic style hotel meets Trendy modern SPA L'Occitane treatment rooms/areas. On arrival I was greeted by professional and friendly staff and was offered a glass of champagne whilst checking in. My room was spacious (large bathroom too), Rustic/a little dated but OK. Had side views of hotel gardens and views of Barceleona and beautiful views of a Cathedral, a 10 walk from hotel. You can visit the Cathedral and/or climb via lift(€3.50) and steps to the top, views are amazing, definitely worth the climb. An amusement park (not for me) & cafe next door but closed (wintertime). Back at the hotel I had a lovely outdoor and indoor swim then an amazing hour of fantantic Spa treatments, would definitely recommend, pure bliss. Had dinner in Cafe 125 restaurant, such lovely food  and views of Barcelona and truely lovely staff, thank you Giorgio and everyone . Was given a complimentary Birthday surprise dessert and glass of Moet champagne and earlier on return to my room found a large tray of chocolate strawberries, such lovely little touches.Complimentary Marshmallows and Sweeties in foyer. Hotel has small ladies boutique clothes shop and L'occitane shop. Hotel is outside of Barcelona, taxi ride (€16-20 one way) or bus available. Hotel is best suited for people wanting to have a relaxing break. A special thanks to the staff at the hotel, who made my Birthday stay very special, special thanks to Roger, Guillam and Giorgio, assets to the hotel. I would however recommend a little upgrade of ladies changing rooms, very spacious but looking a little tired. I look forward in returning. Thank you everyone.",5,2018,01,23
28,amazing hotel! far from city..,"great experince from the hotel! only problem is transportation to the city. 20- 25 euros taxi to center of city (ramblas etc). be sure to book shuttles from hotel in advance or you'l be put on waiting list that does'nt really help al the time..
would really suggest the hotel to hire a big buss for the shuttle- it is currently not enough! and make it more frequent, otherwise custumers won't be able to compincate on the distance from the city!",4,2018,01,19
28,Perfect stay,"My family and I we spent some days at La Florida during Christmas and we can just say that it was fabulous. The stunning views an exceptional service were amazing. We were placed in rooms in the 4th floor with views to the city and we did enjoy both the Spa and breakfast service. Special congratulations go to Roger Sunyer for his exceptional service and attention to detail. Guillem, who quite helped us with our bags. And Mihaela and Corina at the breakfast service who served us nicely. 
My only con would rather be that the scrambled eggs at breakfast were a bit overcooked. But this does not shadow all the cared and nice service that we received. We will be surely staying at La Florida in our future visits to Barcelona.",5,2018,01,11
28,A very good stay,"The very first remark is at the excellent location. Situate at the top of Mount Tibidago it offers magnificent views. We were particularly pleased with the views from the hotel restaurant while we enjoyed breakfast. The breakfast spread is not as extravagant as most 5 star hotels but you will definitely not be left hungry and we found it sufficient. The room was spacious with high ceilings and little balconies where you can catch the sun and enjoy the views. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but I suppose if you bring your own tea bags or coffee the hotel should be able to provide you with hot water (if you are particular about the early morning cuppa!) or of course order room service. Although we didn’t use the spa we did visit the pool and gym. The indoor pool is longer than average and was the perfect temperature. The ladies changing rooms were massive but parts of it did look like work was still being done. There was no scrimping on towels and plenty of toiletries available.  This was our first time in Barcelona and the reception staff took the time to explain to us the different ways of getting to and from the hotel and the city including maps and contact details if we needed any help. On the first night, we went to the Sagrat Cor church, which I would recommend, and the amusement park both of which are just around the corner.  The following days we took the shuttle bus to the city and our driver was most informative and helpful. He is definitely an asset to the hotel (unfortunately I dont remember his name). The return shuttle is around 3.30 pm so it does shorten the time you have to spend in the city unless you take a taxi back or a bus.",4,2018,01,05
28,Great for the kids as well,We have been several times to this amazing hotel already and this one for the 1st time with 7 years old kids and it was great. They truly could feel like at home with a very kind staff and you don't get that kind of feeling often in hotels of that type. I can only further recommend this place. And if you can try to have city views room on second floor with high windows.,5,2018,01,03
28,5* location but many aspects of this hotel are not 5*,"We stayed at the Gran Hotel La Florida for 3 nights from Friday 29th Dec - Monday 1st Jan.

The hotel is in an amazing location, with stunning views over Barcelona and, on the evening when we arrived, I remember thinking how pretty it looked lit up on the top of the hill.

The member of staff who checked us in was very accommodating and helpful and, on the whole, many staff members were really lovely. We were especially fond of the waiter on our first night in Café 1925, and service from the bar staff in the lounge was excellent as well.

The hotel smells delightful and, when we passed comment about this to a member of staff, he mentioned that the scent can be bought for 25 euro from the L'Occitane shop. I thought he was joking, but he insisted it's true. I did not investigate further but soon learnt that everything in this hotel is available at cost!!

Our room was bright and spacious, but not what we were expecting from a 5* hotel. We had a very large and comfortable double bed but the touches that make the difference between 4* and 5* were missing.

Here are a few examples:

- The air conditioning was poor, or not working. We did report this to reception but did not notice any improvement and resorted to opening the window to let in fresh air.

- The bulb in the bedside light was not working on arrival. We took the bulb out and left it on the bedside table, but it was not replaced until the last evening of our visit.

- There was an absence of tea and coffee making facilities or anything complimentary, aside from 2 small bottles of water and a chocolate with the turn down service

- We were missing slippers in our room and, when we requested them, we were told they were in our room. It took a little persuading to convince staff that this was not the case.

- Room service was very expensive, somewhat unreliable and not especially good. We only ordered toast and hot drinks (anything more was approx. 27 euro per person) but the toast was always cold and the coffee was from a machine. On one occasion we received someone else's breakfast an hour earlier than the breakfast we had ordered. On another occasion we received tea without milk and were told it was because we hadn't requested the milk - despite placing the same order the day before and receiving milk. And, finally, on another occasion we didn't receive our room service because they had taken down the wrong room number, despite my partner ordering in person and showing our room key. Then, when it did arrive, we had the wrong drinks but, by that time, we were just grateful to have received it. 

- Many of the English channels on the TV did not work for the majority of our stay.

- Our room was also next to a staff room, with a door that would bang and squeak often as staff were going in and out

The indoor pool and facilities were the main reason why we chose this hotel, but we were sorely disappointed with the facilities and only visited once. The indoor pool was very cold and the saunas were tucked away in separate male/female changing areas. 

The complimentary bus, which we had read leaves 3 times a day, only had one departure time from the hotel and one return time from Barcelona centre. However, the public bus was fantastic for 3 euro per person. It runs every 20 minutes and doesn't stop until it reaches Placa de Catalunya. 

The communal areas in the hotel reception and bar area are lovely, relaxing places to sit and enjoy a drink in the evening. However, this was let down by the toilets, which did not have any hand soap for the duration of our visit, were not always clean and had hooks hanging off walls.

I should mention that I have never left a comment on TripAdvisor before but, having paid for, and expected, a 5* experience I am disappointed that this is not what we received. I  suspect our experience may have been exacerbated by the Christmas period but, even so, I would expect a 5* hotel to be of a consistently exceptional standard.

I felt we paid 5* prices for, at best, a 4* experience and will not be visiting here again.

P.S. We also booked via booking.com with the promise of a free complimentary drink on arrival and priority late check-out. We requested both of these prior to arrival but did not hear back. We did get the late check-out but were not given priority, and had to double check again on the morning of departure.",3,2018,01,02
28,Gorgeous and wonderful,"Granted, this hotel is not downtown and it is a 25 minute taxi ride on winding roads.  But this is a hotel that you don't want to leave anyway! Front desk staff were professional and helpful, room was gorgeous, comfortable, clean and fabulous view (402).  Spa was heavenly, and food delicious.  Hotel and property is beautiful, with great pool and fitness center.  Recommend 100%",5,2017,12,26
28,Xmas lunch,Very very disappointed. Service very slow and food quality very low. If you have the chance go stay at the Arts otherwise you will be very disappointed. Cant believe how bad this is! For an international hotel The clientele was very local as well,1,2017,12,25
28,Attention Bad policies ,We wanted to stay in this hotel but unfortunately we were discriminated right after our booking. Persons of reduced mobility in a wheelchair have to pay an enormous extra to be guests of this hotel because they have to book a more expensive category. This is discrimination. We do not support hotels with a policy like that. Many other hotels in the whole world do not force handicapped guests to pay more. ,1,2017,12,21
28,Lumineux élégant ,"We spent 3 days seminar in this hotal. Rooms are spacious, full of light likewise for the meeting rooms. Great view on Barcelona and the sea. Excellent service. Enjoy the swimming pool and food.
I can only recommend this hotel restaurant.
It would be lovely for a wedding or other celebration.",5,2017,12,16
28,Excellent hotel and beautiful views,"Very good hotel, spacious family room and big bath, shower and toilet area. Breakfast reasonable, not as in 5 stars hotels but we liked it. the furniture is basic so not not expect luxury furniture. The views from the top of the mountain are excellent. You can get by taxi to Barcelona city centre in 2-5 minutes for 20 euros.
They still use old fashioned key rather than key-cards.
Saloon area in nice, staff nice. The only bad thing was the cold eater in the closed pool. I saw previous reviews and comments from the hotel that they are following standards... whatever the standards are, very cold water but the Jacuzzi is nice.
If I ago again to Barcelona, I will definitely stay again there, especially if I get a good deal like the one I had",5,2017,12,02
28,Perfect for a Mini Moon!,"Me and my husband booked this place for our mini moon in October 2017. The hotel is FANTASTIC! The location is absolutely great. The staff members were a delight, Although one of the concierge guys just seemed confused all the time but in the cutest way. 

We got one of the Suites on the 6th floor which overlooked the whole of Barcelona from our balcony which also had a private Jacuzzi. 

The rooms were cleaned every day to perfection, I literally had no complaints with house keeping. It is such a special hotel. 

We hired a car for our trip and found it to be much more relaxing not having to wake up at a certain time to catch the hotel shuttle bus to the city center every day. If you can, then hire a car! You won't regret it. 

The hotel is not Muslim friendly, which meant eating options were very limited and my husband who is a fussy eater, barely ate anything during our holiday. That was a shame. 

THE SPA IS TO DIE FOR!!! Make sure you try the LO'ccitane Spa which was just divine! I had a full body massage and facial done and honestly the highlight of my trip! 

Thank you for making our trip so special.

28,Relaxing and excellent service,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon for 6 night. Upon arrival we were attended to quickly and with efficiency. If your looking for a quick stop over for 1 or 2 nights then this isn’t for you. It’s outside Barcelona but looks out over the city with amazing views. It’s relaxed and quiet with a very good service from front desk to house keeping. A short 20 mins bus or the hotel courtesy bus of 15 mins takes you direct to the centre and its busy down there so the hotel offers a great escape after a day in the centre. The view from the pool area is amazing, the staff are very very helpful and after reading a number of negative reviews for various reasons i find it unjustified in my opinion. I did notice a floor tile on the veranda broken and the next day it had been repaired, the towels were 5 star and the robes fitted me for once being 6 ft most hotels don’t cater for robes for my size. The breakfast was excellent and offered a full range for all. The park next door added some real fun and wasn’t intrusive with noise so don’t be put off by that. I do fully intend to go back but this time will spend more time round the pool relaxing if the weathers warmer as the layout is well thought out and looks very comfortable. Great for romantic/honeymoons and also for families. The staff were always on hand and the chap ( i’ve Forgotten his name) who drove us the Barcelona on two occasion was very knowledgable and offered great advice.  Lovely hotel and charming staff and its easily an undiscovered gem of a hotel, with views that are etched on my memeory forever. Thank you La Florida for making my honeymoon, my wife was overjoyed with the hotel.",5,2017,10,29
28,Celebrated Our Anniversary,"We had a phenomenal experience celebrating our anniversary at the Gran Hotel La Florida.  From the very first moment, we were impressed with the hotel's attention to detail and warm, welcoming vibe.  They'd given us a suite overlooking the mountain side of the hotel with incredible views all down throughout Cerdanyola and out toward Montserrat.  The room was beyond charming with unique touches that made it feel like a home and not a hotel, including a staircase to an upstairs bedroom and a lovely sitting room area.  The bathtub was heavenly and huge, and we were even welcomed with a plate of local cookies!  We swam in the long pool and had a romantic dinner at their lovely restaurant, Barcelonas, where the food was outstanding and the service incredible. Perhaps the best service we've had at a restaurant in Europe!  We never quite figured out how to turn off the air conditioning unit but truly this was a perfect stay and I cannot wait to return there again for a future celebration.  It was nothing short of magical.  Thank you so much, muchisimas gracias! ",5,2017,10,29
28,What a let down! ,"Can't believe it's a 5 star hotel! The only 5star is the view and the breakfast buffet. We went on our wedding night and the receptionist was pretty rude, the bathroom had mo and I have never had such a McDonald's like ceaser salad for 22€. And we are from Barcelona, so language was not a barrier for the receptionist... Pretty disappointing
 ",2,2017,10,28
28,"Far from the city, nice to relax","Excellent treatment with views of the city. Worth staying for dinner in the restaurant.
Lejos de Barcelona pero perfecto para desconectar. 
The best way to arrive is with your own car, the valet parking is much appreciated. 

The day before it had rained and the hammocks on the terrace were still wet. They could change the cover before we arrived.",5,2017,10,16
28,Fantastic location and wonderful swimming pool,"We spent two nights here and, in many ways, thought the hotel was great but we were disappointed with the food. The good things were we had a lovely view of the city and mountains from our room and a private balcony. As keen swimmers, we thought the pool was one of the best hotel pools ever, We appreciated the fact that the staff obtained our favourite newspaper each morning (we believe they had to find it on line and then print it out). The restaurant 1925 was disappointing however. We ate there the first night and thought the food was poor as was the service. The second night we ate at the fine dining restaurant ""Barcelonas"" and chose the tasting menu. The first courses were lovely but the two main courses (fish and meat) were not. Breakfasts were OK although the first morning we were shown to our table by a young woman on the phone and she did not put the phone down while taking us to the table! The hotel is located quite far from the city centre making taxis expensive. The hotel does run a shuttle into the city three times each day but when we wanted to take the midday shuttle, we were told we could not use this as it was fully booked. So we had a mixture of good and not so good experiences.",4,2017,10,03
28,Spectacular wedding venue overlooking Barcelona with absolute 5 star service !!!!,"We have just returned from our honeymoon after getting married on the terraces of Gran Hotel La Florida and we can find the words to describe how wonderful our entire wedding was from the moment we came in for a tasting last December, through the wedding planning itself, and then the final planning the week of, and then of course THE BIG DAY!

My wife, originally being from Barcelona, & I live in Miami, so we had a great mix of a local crowd from BCN & then 50 guest who flew in from all of the States.
When we told our local friends and family that the venue was La Florida they beamed in excitement as they all knew of how fabulous of a hotel it is & so excited that we were going to be celebrating there.
When our guests from the States arrived at the hotel, they were beyond amazed at the views, the interiors, the rooms, and then as they visit progressed they became incredibly impressed with the staff and service.

We have been told by many friends and family that we had the ""best wedding ever"" (perhaps that's what everyone says to the bride & groom!) and we know that having our celebration at such a fabulous venue with such 5 star service certainly is a major reason why everyone had such a fun time celebrating such a memorable day with us :)",5,2017,09,27
28,Stunning View,The location of this hotel makes it extraordinary. There are amazing views of Barcelona both during the day and at night. If you choose to leave the beautiful pool or the comfy and classy room to venture into the city it is about 20 minutes by car. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle at various times during the day which drops you off at the city center and returns to pick you up. You couldn't ask for a more helpful or pleasant staff! I would highly recommend this hotel!,5,2017,09,26
28,Dream Wedding,We stayed here for 5 days and in that time had our wedding. We can't say enough good things about this hotel. The location is just stunning and the hotel is beautiful. The staff are outstanding- every one our guests commented how good they all were. Our wedding was flawless thanks to Sara the events manager and all of her very helpful colleagues. We would recommend to anyone!,5,2017,09,25
28,Beautiful view of the city,"Hotel is a 20 minute ride high above the city. It is not within walking distance. Breaking views from the Restaurant and multi level patio area and most rooms. The super super long pool is unlike no other. Chest level throughout, L shape with the one end overlooking the city. If you are a swimmer or just want to walk to extraordinary length it is a must. Breakfast and supper eaten in the restaurant overlooking the city. Both wonderful.",5,2017,09,13
28,Wonderful place for a short break,"Really good hotel just to stay and enjoy - visit the city another day!. 
May not be quite typical of 5star but very helpful and respectfully friendly staff, fantastic panorama city view and was nicer than it looked in photos. We loved the pool and the corner family room with view. Breakfast buffet excellent. Expensive when we stayed as last minute booking at peak time and we needed family room, which is a suite. Worth ensuring you get a view. 

Bar food was just OK but the poolside bar and loungers were great. Main terrace restaurant was quite good but we didn't use the fine dining restaurant as was a bit too upmarket for our grubby kids. Kids fish from restaurant the only bad experience - beautifully presented but really poor piece of fish that I wouldn't have given to the cat. 

It's next to Tibidabo park - nice 5 min walk, and they offer minibus transfers to edge of city although it's quite a long way from heart of city by road so stay for the hotel and not if you're visiting just for city sightseeing. Highly recommended though.",5,2017,09,09
28,Great service let down by tired rooms and room with no view,"We booked a mountain terrace view room however the view was of a bush and air con machine. The bus stop and road were the highlight. 

On a positive note good service and friendly staff. 

Our biggest disappointment though was the room, dirty walls and scruffy inside generally as seen in some pictures with the fridge box. This all made for a soulless hotel. The room walls were pealing and very dirty and required painting, the wooden floors damaged and furniture generally in poor condition. Food was not great and not worth the high cost of 85euros without drinks, I could not eat the pimentos peppers they were so tough, and we had extras we did not have put on our bill. In summary not worth the money, will not return. ",2,2017,09,09
28,Business travel to the most beautiful location in Barcelona,"My first trip to Barcelona ever was to a hotel in the City Center, close to the beach. Where I spend 3 days in both the Pullman Hotel and hotel Icaria. I was not blown away by the city of which I heard many great stories.

So when I had to go again, but this time to Gran Hotel La Florida I was not that enthusiastic. 
Oh boy was I wrong!!

Gran Hotel La Florida (not cheap) Is a great hotel. Let me start by arriving, I took a taxi from the airport and the road there was about 30-45 minutes. After 15 minutes of city we went up the mountain. And was this trip beautiful, Going up with great views of the city and it would only get better.

Once up the mountain the service was great, they helped me out of the taxi, took my bags, walked me to the room. It was amazing to say the least, untill I walked in the room. I was on the 4th floor, on a corner with a view over both the Mountain range and city.

I added pictures for you readers to see.

In the evening having dinner on the terrace, food was excellent. Breakfast next day was great. I did not have a chance to try the pool, after all it was a business trip. However it looked great.

This is one of those Hotels you just have to go see, spend a weekend with your girlfriend for a special romantic weekend. 

Important: I am 2 meters tall, but they had kingsize beds! I slept like a baby!
Important 2: There is great free WIFI.",5,2017,08,28
28,20th Anniversary Getaway,"My wife and I were made aware of this hotel whilst taking a Barcelona day trip on last year's holiday to the Portaventura park. Part of this day out included a visit to Barcelona's Mount Tibidabo.  When we were deciding on somewhere to have a 20th Anniversary getaway, we knew we wanted to visit Barcelona to explore the city in greater detail, and, after looking at city centre hotels, we decided to go for full luxury at the Gran Hotel La Florida.

We stayed over 11 - 14 August. We arrived at the hotel around 11am after an early flight from the UK. Although our room was not ready, we weren't surprised as the stated check in time is 1500.  The friendly reception staff did however state that we were free to use all of the hotel's facilities such as pool, spa or terrace bar.  The hotel looked after our bags and we headed for the nearby leisure park on Mount Tibidabo.

Returning at around 1530, we were able to go straight up to our room, a City View suite...and what a room!   The walk in shower was not far off the size of our bathroom at home.  Our room was spacious, comfortable, attractively furnished and had two balconies,  one overlooking Barcelona with La Sagrada Familia clearly visible and the other giving us a view of Montserrat.

The time we spent at the hotel for the next three days was an absolute joy from our point of view.

The breakfast buffet consisted of many options including cooked English, Spanish meats as well as a large selection of fruits, yoghurts and so on.  On a personal level, I'm not too sure why things like pecan pie, chocolate cake and so on were available but anything goes on holiday!

My wife, as a special treat, allowed me to pay for a spa treatment for her.  She had nothing but good words to say about the staff and the treatment. The spa is run as a l'Occitaine en Provence business so if you are familiar with their products, you know what to expect.

The pool area, bar and terrace were of a high standard and we enjoyed these facilities in the evenings.  The pool is L-Shaped with the longest part being 37 metres so you can get a good swim in. The pool also goes from indoors to outdoors so depending on the temperature outside or if you want to escape the sun, you can still enjoy a swim.

The hotel runs a fitness suite utilising some static weight machines and the usual bike, cross trainer and running machines.  These were in good order and you an use them 24 hours a day so I was able to get some exercise in nice and early before breakfast.

My wife and I consider ourselves to be fairly undemanding customers so we had no complaints with the state of the rooms or the service provided by the staff, all of whom we found to be courteous, attentive and willing to help.

I have noticed in some other reviews that a common cause of complaint is the relative remoteness of the hotel.  We were there i summer so we had no issues with getting into Barcelona.  If you are after a winter break, check on transport options as you may have to rely on taxis to get to and from the hotel.

Transport options available include:
1. Shuttle bus run by the hotel.  Get there early as space is limited.  
2. T2A bus service directly outside the hotel. 3 euros for a single gets you down to Place de Catalunya in the centre of Barcelona. Journey time approximately 30 minutes. In summer, service starts at 1000 and the last bus back will be around 2130.
3. More convoluted but very touristy is the option of the Funicular train from Mt Tibidabo (5 minutes walk) down to a tram that continues into Barcelona. This normally commences around 1100 and the last service back is around 2230.

Check times, it's all available online.

If you are not willing to go for the public transport options and you haven't got your own transport, you will end up secluded unless you want to spend around 30 euros per taxi trip.

In summary, despite being on a relatively expensive side, we got what we paid for.  Facilities, venues, room, staff, drinks were all to our satisfaction. If my wife and I do not get back sooner, we will be here for our Silver Anniversary.

On that note, we would like to extend our gratitude to all at the hotel that made our stay an absolute pleasure.",5,2017,08,17
28,Simply amazing!,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights (1st-4th August).On arrival we were warmly greeted,checked in and shown around the hotel and grounds. We stayed in a terrace room 109, which was beautiful. Our stay included breakfast and this was varied, fresh and delicious. Camille waited on us each morning and was fantastic! She is so attentive and friendly, as are all of the staff!
Initially when I booked, I didn't realise how far away from the centre we were. Luckily we booked a car and collected it from the airport. This gave us the best of both worlds; the quiet and calmness of a hotel up a mountain, which was away from it all and the independence of a car to quickly get into town (within 25 mins). Don't use taxis they are too expensive! The hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle bus, but the last one is 6.30pm, so definitely rent a car!
I would definitely recommend this hotel. Thank you for a wonderful stay. ",5,2017,08,14
28,Beautiful ,"Wow what a hotel! Highly recommend! So comfortable and peaceful compared to the busyness of the city centre! We stay 5 nights and was so relaxing the staff from check in to check out were helpful breath taking mountain views from both our balconies! 

We took the shuttle bus into town and sometimes the T2A bus which took you to the city centre. 

Really recommend this hotel ",5,2017,08,12
28,Perfect,"We spent 4 nights here in 2 terrace rooms with a 14 yr old. Rooms are spacious, clean and relaxing. Hotel is peaceful and has fabulous views over Barcelona. Would recommend a City view room preferably floor 3 or above. The pool has both an indoor and outdoor section, perfect for any change in the weather as was never too crowded.

We found that Room Service was vastly superior experience to the main restaurant as although the menu was the same, the service was amazing and much more personal. It was wonderful to dine by candlelight on your own terrace.

The hotel is on the Tibidabo mountain, just outside the zone for the T10 travel card but a bus from Catalanya to right outside the hotel is only €3 and about 15 mins. The hotel does also provide a free shuttle service. It is also nearby the Amusement Park.

We would definitely stay at this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona. One of the outstanding points was the overall attitude of the staff: courteous, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We found Philippe on Room Service and Alex and Luca on reception particularly helpful. Having allergies often means that finding food late at night very difficult and Philippe went out of his way to ensure we had a tasty and nutritious off-menu meal after midnight which he delivered with a great smile and charm.

Thank you for a wonderful stay",5,2017,08,10
28,Get the celebrity treatment on your vacation,"Can't say enough good things about this hotel.  We were greeted warmly upon our 8am arrival, even though our room wasn't available until 3pm.  The staff took care of our bags, brought us coffee and got us set up outside by the beautiful infinity pool and view of Barcelona that cannot be beat.  The staff brings you a little button to puch by your lounge to call for service.  Our room #402 was a corner room, two balconies, one overlooking the city the other looking at Tibidabo.  The sounds of the amusement park at night were very romantic.  As far as transport to town...the shuttle can fill up but we only used it once anyway.  The Tibidabo bus runs every 20 minutes while park is open (and its open a lot).  It was maybe 2 euro each way, you can pay the driver,  and drops you at Catalunya Plaza- easy to taxi to dinner or other attractions.  If you miss the bus, Taxi as about 25 euro.  Also- the L'Occitaine spa and massage, I highly recommend.",5,2017,08,08
28,Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel.,"I cannot recommend Gran Hotel La Florida enough, it is beautifully styled and the staff are fantastic. They provided us with a very professional yet personalised service that could not be faulted and truly added to making our stay all the more wonderful. With regard to the room it was finished to an very high standard, we stayed in room 118 which had beautiful sea views and a balcony. The hotel itself is something to behold each room is tastefully decorated and it has an exceptionally relaxing atmosphere. The hotel is outside of the city which is exactly what we wanted, peace, quiet and tranquility with the option to hop on the bus and go into the city when need be. The bus is located right beside the hotel and was only €3pp taking you directly into the city centre. The T2B bus runs every 20minutes and most attractions are within walking distance from the centre. I cannot recommend this fabulous hotel enough, we had a fantastic time and will be back.",5,2017,08,04

28,Set A Really High Standard,"My wife is a heat seeking missile for the truly special things in life.  You know, those things that sit at the intersection of ""great price"" and ""fantastic quality"".  It's no mean feat then, that Gran Hotel La Florida sits among her list of ""favorite places"" to stay.  

From check-in to check-out, expect a sterling quality of service from everyone.  The whole staff radiates a sense of pride at their jobs, and for the place that they work in.  They expect to serve you well, and they expect that they will be good at it.

I don't always like dining in the hotel, but you should for this hotel.  The views of Barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the Barcelona attractions.  That's because the hotel is nestled atop Mt Tibidabo.  It overlooks Barcelona.  That means you trade easy access to Barcelona hot spots for the view and some privacy.

We particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast - an opulent affair spanning all the spreads: from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore.  I particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at La Sagrada Familia -  still imposing from a distance.

The rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable.  I've stayed in Parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in Gran Hotel La Florida.  The turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed.  Our room featured a balcony from which I could check out Sagrat Cor (itself worth a short walk).

There are so many wonderful places in the world to see.  So we it is rare for us to be tempted to return just because of a hotel.  But Gran Hotel La Florida did just that for us.

Hint: parking is valet only (our fee included it), but they are ridiculously quick.

",5,2017,07,22
28,"Lovely rooms and view, out of the way","The hotel is very nice. You definitely need a car if you want to see Barcelona. Getting taxis is difficult and the city bus can take a long time, too. The rooms are spacious and in good condition with very nice furnishings and decor. The food is just ok - better to have a breakfast in the city for less than half the price. And there's nothing to walk to, so pick up whatever snacks and small items you need before you get there. We had a mountain view and overlooked a large fountain at the hotel, which made it sound like it was lightly raining all night - a nice feature.",4,2017,07,10
28,Amazing view and excellent service,"I made a quick stop in the grand Hotel La Florida. I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere on the beautiful terrace, with an mazing view on Barcelona. The staff was very helpful. Perfect to relax during the week-end.",5,2017,07,02
28,Just excellent,"Best Service and excellent location. I have rarely enjoyed a hotel this much. Full of modern art and the pool is huge and gorgeous. 
I was so impressed with the staff and they genuinely enjoy working there. 
A romantic hotel too.",5,2017,06,21
28,"LUXURY, 1924-BUILT GRAND HOTEL OVERLOOKING THE ENTIRE CITY & THE SEA","Located on mount Tibidabo, Barcelona’s highest mountain that also hosts the famous amusement park, La Florida comes with stunning views over Barcelona, its neighbouring cities and the Mediterranean.
The rooms come with comfy beds, walk-in showers (and extra bathtub if applicable), high-class bathroom products, free WiFi, and very attentive service that also includes a turn-down.
The hotel has both outdoor and indoor pools (heated, for a comfortable temperature), again with the respective views, or surrounded with further spa and gym facilities, if the latter. According to the staff, this is where the Barcelona FC team used to come to prepare, celebrate or wind-down from matches.
The bar & outdoor terrace restaurant serves quite nice food, but fails to produce a few classic drinks just right (think dry gin Martini, Margarita etc), which is something you would expect at this James Bond-like location.
The gourmet restaurant, “Barcelonas”, inside, is a beautiful stage for chef Ivan Jiménez’ colourful creations. Tasting menus — ambitious, although a little short of flavour depth at times — don’t cost the world here and are a fun way to end the day up on the mountain.
As La Florida is almost at the end of the road that leads up to Tibidabo, taxi rides are expensive (ca. €30 one way from/to the city, €50 from/to BCN airport). However, if you want to down into town during the day, there’s the T2A bus (not: T2B!) that takes you straight to Plaza de Catalunya for only €3, running every 20 minutes.
This is a perfect luxury break away from busy urban centres, basically on the countryside, but right by Barcelona, if you prefer the hustle and bustle of the city. The only sound you’ll hear every now and then, when the winds are right, are the screaming crowds of the amusement park in the distance.",4,2017,06,18
28,Very bad experience,"The hotel could be charming with his nice old building and beautiful view but there has been a lot of carelessness :
- the outside part is quite damaged (tiles are not pasted anymore)
- the rooms are not very clean (coffee taints that were not wiped, quite old towels, faucets not working very well, a/c working quite badly)
- food is really bad, not tasty at all.
- the service is poor : people are nice in front of you but don't care at all about customers.  If you order at the bar go pay to the bar, no way they bring you the bill directly
- We were told to order at least 2 hours in advance our taxi at 4:30am...it arrived at 5:00 : why don't they order it at 4:15 if it is ""always difficult to get a taxi around 4:00 with the clubs"" as we were told while waiting ? Better pay 5€ more than miss a flight !!!

Anyway Barcelona is a very nice city but never ever again at la florida

28,"Lovely hotel, remote hideaway ","On arrival, we dropped the car off at the entrance and was shown to reception with a glass of Cava to welcome us.  Paperwork completed, the parking charge is a bit steep, but we took full advantage of using the valet facility so I was happy to pay.  

Shown to the room which is outstanding. We requested a city view corner room (room 208) and was not disappointed.  My wife rates it the best view ever (however it's my second place below the city view of the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore).  We are blessed with fantastic weather which certainly helps.

It took three attempts to get our suitcases delivered to the room - a shift change over meant the tags were allocated to the wrong room.

There was a conference on the day of arrival so we were restricted access from the spa/indoor pool area. When we asked to have lunch on the terrace, that too was out of bounds.

As others have stated, forget about the shuttle, it'll be fully booked. We used the car to get to the city one day, parking was easy enough but the bays are tiny and the other drivers/scooter riders are crazy.  Second day we tried to use the bus but got fed up waiting so just used a cab. Depending on where you get dropped off it'll be €16-€22 on the meter.

Having a relaxing time on the terrace sunbathing today, well it would be if it wasn't for the noise of the amusement park next door.  Dinner tonight will be in a separate review.

It would appear as if there's more restrictions today, looks like they're setting up for another conference.  I realise that these events are good for a hotels income but they shouldn't impact on other guests at all in a 5* hotel.

The staff are all friendly enough, but there's too few of them to be attentive enough to their guests.  It's a great hotel for a short break but it's limitations are evident for longer stays.",3,2017,06,15
28,Never stay here,"I recently spent one night at the Gran Hotel La Florida in Barcelona.  I am a frequent business and leisure traveller.  The hotel is arguably the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in.  I have stayed in Motel 6s that are better run than this hotel.

From the time I drove up to the hotel, to the time that I left the hotel, it was one disappointment, and almost disaster, to another. When I drove up to the hotel, the driveway/entrance to the hotel was jammed packed with cars. I had to wait on the street to drive my car to the front door of the hotel so that I could unload my bags. I then had to wait for the valet to park our car as there was nowhere to park, but also because the valet was also the doorman, the bellhop and the concierge. One individual was doing it all. 

Upon entering our room (room 108 which is called the Japanese Suite), I noticed a foul smell in the bathroom, akin to sewage backup and that the room was directly above the hotel’s indoor pool with a large window overlooking the brightly lit pool. As that window afforded us no privacy, I immediately requested a different room. I was told at that time (around 7 pm) that the hotel was fully booked and that no other rooms were available. When I tried to go the bed around 12 midnight, I realized that I would not be able to sleep due to the light streaming into the room from the brightly lit indoor pool. It was at this time – around 12 midnight – that the hotel offered us a different room. I guess someone had checked out between 7 pm and 12 midnight. Since I would be checking out in about 6 hours, I decided to stay in the room. The front desk guy came up to the room to hang black curtains over the pool window to darken the room so that I could sleep while I lay in bed. Also, the wifi in the hotel was not working. I wish I could say that that was all that went wrong. 

Before retiring to my room for the night, I had requested a taxi in the morning to take me to the airport at 6:15 am. I saw the front desk person write the request down in a book. When I went down to reception at 6:10 am, there was no one at reception and the front entrance to the hotel was locked. Very unusual for a hotel of this size. When I finally managed to track down a front desk person, it was clear that the hotel had not called a taxi for me. Now, normally this would not be a problem in a major city like Barcelona. But at this hotel, it is a big problem. The hotel is on a hilltop overlooking Barcelona, some 20 minutes from the center of the city. The hotel had told me upon check in that it was necessary to call for a taxi in advance as there are no taxis nearby. Since they had forgotten to call for a taxi in advance as I had requested, there was nothing that I could do but wait for the taxi which was finally called after 6:15 am. 

I almost missed my international flight. Needless to say, I would not recommend this hotel.",1,2017,05,28
28,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Loved this hotel in every aspect, the views, the rooms, the pool, restaurant, everything was clean and lovely to be around. The staff were very helpful and couldnt do enough for you. The food was also very nice. I would definitely go back!",5,2017,05,02
28,Beautiful Barcelona ,"This was our third visit back to Gran Hotel La Florida and with each visit it only gets better.  The staff are all so welcoming with special thanks to Nicolas at the front desk for arranging yet another spectacular evening at AbaC restaurant, and to Xenia in Barcelonas restaurant who made our night so special with her superb wine pairing to complement the wonderful tasting menu. 
If you visit Gran Florida you must indulge in a massage 'the journey to Provence' experience is truly the best massage and overall experience of any spa I have visited previously.  Back to work for us now until maybe a few weeks to steal a quick weekend in Barcelona's hidden gem with the best view of the city.  ",5,2017,05,01
28,Lovely Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights last week. Our room overlooked the mountains as we forgot to ask for a city view. We are arrived late on Monday night, having used public transport to Vallcarca and then a taxi from there. The Barcelona Tourist Board site suggests that a taxi for this journey is about 10 euros -It was 15 (which wasn't a problem)
We were given a junior suite. The night view of lights stretching out into the distance was very pleasant. The following morning the view was lovely. We had a side balcony which had a view of a part of Barcelona and the sea
 but the weather was hazy so the sea was fairly indistinguishable.
Breakfasts were included in our booking (they appear to start at 28 euros) and there was a good choice.
The idea had been a budget city break, but I found this hotel (with breakfast included) for only £30 more than the three star hotel I had found, so it appeared to make sense. We were upgraded on arrival
On day two and three it rained - and rained and rained. From our fourth floor room, you could see the far side of the road outside and being at the top of the mountain-nothing else. This obviously extended to the front of the hotel where you couldn't see past the patio. This being our second trip to the city, this was weather we clearly hadn't anticipated !  If staying at this hotel the weather will make or break it, and I am sure we were just unlucky. Going into the city later in the day, the cloud was still stuck on the mountain whilst the city was just wet.
The hotel fully justifies it five star rating. The suite was lovely, towels, dressing gowns slippers and toiletries were provided and all were luxurious.The staff were extremely courteous and polite. The swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna were enjoyable
We used public transport as we had bought a four day Barcelona Travel card (we didn't buy the Barcelona card as we had visited most of the places of interest on our first visit ---If on your first visit the Barcelona Card is 10/10 !!!)
One of the few forms of transport not included in the travel card is the Tibidabo Funicular (which is quite costly but five minutes walk))

There are bus stops visible from the hotel.  I had read about a bus that goes straight to the city centre. It is the T2B but is seasonal. In April it only runs at the weekend.

The 111 bus runs from the stop opposite the hotel every 30 minutes. It goes up the hill (then over the top and down the other side and takes just under 10 minutes (with lovely views) to Vallvidrera to get the funicular (- The bus stops directly outside). We never waited more than  a few minutes for the funicular at the bottom of which is  the railway station at Peu del Funicular . There we never waited more than 5 minutes for the S2 train to Playa Catalunya in the city centre. The last part of the journey takes 15 mins. (bear on mind on the way back it is a short platform -the trains appear to have four carriages -some trains were walk though and some were not - get in the middle two to ensure you can get off) 

On a downside the last 111 bus from Peu del Funicular appears to be at about 2115,so you may need to factor in cabs (but certainly not from Vallvidrera as we saw none there it is too remote.
 
If you stay at this hotel make sure you have breakfast included as there is nothing else nearby

If you do not stay at this hotel and visit Barcelona make sure you visit Tibidabo as the views are fabulous !!!!!!. On our first visit we went to Montjuic -the views here are much better. If going for the day the expensive funicular to Tibidabo would make sense BUT come out of the funicular station and turn left away from the amusement park-follow that road for five minutes or less and you will reach the fabulous views of the mountains which are also not to be missed  ",5,2017,04,30
28,Excellent restaurant,"An expensive choice food a special occasion. The restaurant is nice and there is the possibility of booking for groups. Nice food, good service, outstanding spot. One should know this is a first class restaurant within the hotel La Florida.",4,2017,04,29
28,I will return,"I loved the hotel ; the rooms were clean , all the hotel smells good , the view was WOW , the room was spacious .. parking was 17,50 .. breakfast we paid 23 w discount ...Gisele at the front desk is the BEST !",4,2017,04,18
28,Unhonest 3 star hotel,"This hotel advertised is its own website there will be guaranteed upgrade if book thru their website. We reserved a room and write to the hotel and seek for double confirmation to the upgrade, the hotel response with written  confirmation. When we check in, to great surprise, the manager in front desk deny the upgrade notwithstanding the written confirmation is shown to him. Extreme irresponsible behaviour.

The room is shabby and the toilet sting. 3 star hotel is already a compliment to the hotel.

Watch out and don't expect anything beyond 3 star facilities.",1,2017,04,18
28,Will never go back,"Just to say that despite the fact that the hotel is 5 stars (I would categorized it as 4 stars), the employees there doesn’t have a 5 stars level for sure (the reception only).
The hotel has magnificent location in the mountain and kids will be so happy to be nearby Attraction Park.
We arrived 1300 LT to the hotel and the hotel said that they don’t have any room ready yet and they will not accept us till 1500 LT. We waited two hours in the lobby with kids and when 1500 LT came, they took another guests before us and this made us so angry because we knew that they have bad service from the beginning. NO sorry was said from any one including the manager. we received rooms around 1530 and the day almost gone!

The parking is something to take care of it. They will charge 19 or I believe 23 Eur per night for parking while you can just park your car free just in 25 meters away from the hotel.

Every hotel in the world will accept babies!! This hotel made us put the baby who has only 5 months old to sleep with us! They didn’t give us any baby crib to put the baby in. This in my opinion put our baby in danger and we have to be awake or say (sleep with tension that we don’t harm the baby).

In general, good building, good location, very poor service. I will never go back or recommend this hotel",1,2017,04,14
28,Amazing place,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 days , 5 days to remember.
The quality of the hotel , cleanliness and service is exceptional.
Alex , Xavier and Gisela make us very welcome and we can't wait to go back !
Breakfast was really good , the room was spotless: a big thank you and we can't wait to come back .
David and the family",5,2017,04,14
28,Lurxury in abundance,"Just got back from a three night break and have to say a lovely place away from the madding crowd of the city. The staff were so helpfull on arrival all the way through until we left. They have a shuttle bus into the city but gets filled up very quickly so book as soon as you can even a few days before you want too. The front of house staff were pleasant and always attentive.  The taxis rides can mount up and are approx €30 each way. So you might want to factor this in.  
  The food was lovely though a tad on the dear side but no more than you would find in a hotel of this quality. Recommend room service for a dinner. This wasn't as expensive as I thought and made a change. 
 Would recommend this to all and will be back again I have no doubt.just one note. Don't forget to factor in the €21 / day car parking if you have a car but agin do your homework to see if this is for you  
 Great time and pleasant stay. Well done all for making us welcome at your hotel and city",5,2017,04,13
28,Place to remember,"we stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and our experience was very satisfying. Hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport and located about 500 meters above sea level, hence the view from the hotel was absolutely breathtaking. However, the down side to this is getting to the Barcelona city centre can be bit costly unless you book the hotel shuttle bus service in advance. We tried to book the bus on arrival but unfortunately it was fully booked and only managed to get it booked for the last day of our holiday. Taxis are widely available and it will generally cost you between 25 euros one way. (to the city centre) So, word of advise, make sure to book your shuttle bus before you get to the hotel.
All other services provided by the hotel are quite satisfying. Staff are courteous and very friendly. It is a crime if we don't mention the lady who always smile and go an extra mile to help her guest, called Gisele. Thank you so much for all your help to re-arrange our flights!!",5,2017,04,09
28,Wonderful hotel but pricey,"We had two days in Barcelona and I have always wanted to stay at this hotel.
It did not disappoint. The family room is spacious and very well appointed. Views are beautiful.
Indoor and outdoor pools both lovely.
We had food on the terrace and enjoyed it but 14 Euros for a cocktail is excessive. 
However it does not compare to the 6 Euros I was charged for a tea bag.
The hotel has a nice ambience and is only 25 mins from central Barcelona. A taxi costs 25 Euros from the hotel to Placa Catalunya.
The hotel does have a free shuttle to the centre of town but it only runs three times a day and the bus only had 6 seats. No space for our family of four.

We will definitely return but the remote location means that the hotel has a captive audience!",4,2017,04,07
28,fantastic view hotel!!,hotel situated at Tibidabo mountain with small park near it. room was big and clean with big terrace and fantastic view from it on Barcelona and sea.swimming pool was closed for cleaning(( restaurants was fantastic and staff was helpfull,4,2017,04,04
28,dream hotel,this is the best hotel i have ever stayed. It is great for business or leisure. People are warm and friendly from the heart. Location is fantastic with panoramic view of Barcelona! Make sure you do not miss it!,5,2017,03,30
28,Beautiful views,"This hotel sits up on top of a mountain with a spectacular view overlooking Barcelona.  It is located about a 20 minute taxi ride from the city (cost is about 15-20 Euros) each way.  
The hotel is well kept and the room was a good size and had a 2 small balconies overlooking the city.  The room had all I needed (was there for business), nice size shower and tub, spacious plan, nice balconies with a small table and 2 chairs.  
I did not try to spa but it looked very nice.  The food was very good and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  If you like a quiet location only a short distance from the city this is a good choice.  I would stay here again.",4,2017,03,24
28,Great Spot,"Although this hotel is high up overlooking Barcelona and not where the action is, the result is that you feel that you are somewhere non urban and very special. The bedrooms are really lovely and so comfortable and really well appointed. I love the outside of the hotel with the terraced bar and Café area.  It's a lovely place for lunch outside as the views are wonderful and you feel very much that you are on a seaside holiday.  The hotel is super sleek, with a long narrow pool that is 'in and out'  is pretty cool. The restaurant is also good though my preference is to eat outside for both lunch and dinner. It's a fab location and different to a city stay. ",4,2017,03,23
28,Simply magical!,"I've been fortunate to stay at many boutique/luxury hotels and this one was among the best I've ever stayed at. From the dramatic setting atop Mount Tibidabo overlooking Barcelona to the exquisite Spa by L'Occitane and the pool area, this is a perfect retreat from downtown Barcelona's buzz and traffic. The service was thoughtful and anticipative (the breakfast staff made me a lunchbox to have breakfast on the way to the airport when I told them I only had time for coffee). The only thing I would have liked to see would be an in-room water kettle or coffee machine.",5,2017,03,23
28,Lovely comfortable hotel ,The staff are outstanding here. So kind and friendly and never wanting to refuse a request. I was there for three nights over the weekend with my sister and we wanted to laze around and sunbathe however as they were renovating the sun deck there were no loungers available but they sorted out a couple of beds for us. It is a very elegant hotel. ,5,2017,03,20
28,amazing hotel BUT location far out,"I would rate this hotel 5 however the location did put a bit of a downer on my score. There is a shuttle bus service however only runs at certain times and if travelling at a busy time i would suggest booking your spot on the shuttle bus asap! as the shuttle bus is not that great. However if location is not an issue for you then id say go for it is still an amazing hotel.
Theres a theme park near by like literally 5/10 mins from the hotel, which id defo say attend if you can, so much fun.
Breakfast was good, a small selection of each thing eg pastries, juice etc but i guess because its a small hotel maybe thats why.
We stayed in room 305 which was a junior suite, which im so happy i went for this room, it felt like an apartment minus a kitchen area lol.
it was so big and spacious, had a huge bathroom with a bath, really good size shower with amazing shower head felt like i was having a massage on my back, sepearte toilet and double sink. theres a huge wardrobe space.
it had a mini living room with a sofa and table and desk. then the bedroom can be closed off as there are sliding doors, onto the bedroom with two doors to come out with the balcony and mini fridge, coffee machine maker thing and tv.
my partner and i felt like we had a apartment and not a hotel room, it was lush!!!
despite the hotel being a bit far out from town the service from the staff and cleanliness of the room was great!
me and my partner found a way to get a taxi to the train station then the trains where we wanted to go, when the shuttle service wasnt running.
Overall despite the location hotel is 10/10

(dont have a lot of room/hotel pictures as i was too excited with my videoing but took screenshots from my videos hope that helps)",4,2017,03,16
28,5* Elegance and Service,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my 50th birthday.  From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable.  Our junior suite was upgraded to a huge corner suite with with private terrace and magnificent views of Barcelona and the sea.  The attention to detail was definitely 5* with L'Occitane toiletries, fluffy white towels and bathrobes, slippers, chocolates and complimentary newspapers.  As an added treat there was a bottle of bubbly and chocolate desert in the room when we arrived.

All the staff were incredibly attentive, polite and courteous at all times and couldn't do enough for us, Roger and Francesc in particular.  There are plenty of comfy sofas and chairs in the hotel lounge which has a really relaxed feel and is a great place to chill out in the evening.  The pool looked great but we didn't have time to use it as there was so much to see in town during the short time we were there.

The hotel is a little way out of Barcelona so a free shuttle is provided down to town which takes approx 15 mins.  The last one back is 4pm so if you want to stay in Barcelona later than this then you can either take a cab (approx 20-30 euros) or public transport which is a bit of a trek but this didn't bother us, as it was all part of the adventure.

We would definitely stay at this wonderful oasis of calm again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a relaxing retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",5,2017,03,08
28,Luxurious  Stay,"We were upgraded to a suite and the room was out of this world! It had a jacuzzi bath on our private terrace and the most fantastic views of Barcelona. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The staff were very helpful and the hotel had a very luxurious feel to it, we got a glass of cava on arrival and the check-in process was very efficient. 

We enjoyed using the swimming pool and jacuzzi but were a little disappointed there wasn't a sauna or steam room to relax in. We didn't bother travelling in to Barcelona as we had spent a few days at a hotel in the city but it was only 20 mins by taxi (or you could take public transport which we did to get to the hotel - the cable car/tram was a great experience and the bus from the station drops you right outside the hotel). 

The breakfast buffet option was a little expensive so we chose to have room service which was very tasty. We ate in the cafe restaurant in the evening. The food was nice but it lacked atmosphere. 

It was overall a lovely hotel to unwind in. The views were absolutely stunning at it would be a great place to have lunch on the terrace when the weather is warm. The upgrade made this stay exceptional and I would recommend this hotel for anyone that wants to experience a little bit of luxury!",5,2017,03,07
28,Excellent,"We stayed there in May. It was only 3 days after our cruise ship holiday. Breathtaking view. We had a whole Barcelona from the window view. Hotel is located about 20 minutes driving from the City Centre. Very good service, amazing breakfast.",5,2017,03,05
28,Amazing hotel,"Amazing views and setting looking down over Barcelona. I can highlight the efficient and friendly staff. I've been there with a friend for one weekend and the check in was rapid and easy to do. 

The personal of the reception helped us with everything and finding the best places to visit in Barcelona. We stayed at a very spacious room with lovely decoration and location over the city. 

They have great service and everything makes you feel as you were at home.
Fully recommended because of the amazing staff and stunning views.",5,2017,02,28
28,Best View of Barcelona,"The hotel is beautiful and staff polity however when we arrived it seems like there was lack of leadership within their team. We encountered same issues as they had new staff however their director and the girl from the guest relation did their best to cover the incidents and for that I will definitely return on my next visit to Barcelona. 
As per the location you will do up to 20 minutes from the hotel to Barceloneta beach which is great. What I can say is that they need massive improve in the quality of the food products or maybe a big change in their kitchen. 
I will definitely recommend this place although we encountered some situations good staff are working there.",4,2017,02,20
28,Wedding in La Florida Barcelona,"I cannot praise the staff enough of this hotel that made everything possible for us to enjoy our wedding day at this hotel. We married in the Basilica at Tibidabo amd held the reception and after party here in the La Florida. The hotel was immaculate, the food was even better than the tasting we did a few weeks prior (and the food was excellent at the tasting). In fact our wedding guests still recall and comment on the excellence of the venue, the food and the wine. Judith and her team were absolutely fantastic in facilitatingnour every need and making sure that our wedding guests were looked after. Manuel and his banqueting staff were also top class in ensuring everything went well. Following tapas on the terrace, dinner in the cafe 1924 we then danced the night away in the Luna Club downstairs. The setting was special and the day will always be remembered.

I stayed in a corner room (208) the night before the wedding and it had splendid views of the City of Barcelona and the Mediterranean in the distance. On the night of our wedding and the night after we stayed in a suite on the top floor. The suite had fantastic views but unfortunately, being the beginning of October, it was quiet cold up there. While we did contact staff they were helpful providing extra blankets but the heating had yet to be set for the colder weather.

We also used the Spa and pool at the hotel and facilities were excellent. When eating in the hotel during the day service can sometimes be slow as staff have a lot of ground to cover between the lobby, the two restaurants and the kitchen. There was a frustrating instance where we were late for an engagement trying to find a staff member to get the bill and then when the bill came it was for another tables food. They had gotten and paid our bill and it was almost being put to us that we should pay theirs, which was more expensive than ours. However, it was resolved efficiently, friendly and apologetically. Mistakes can happen anyone and their ability to see them and fix them in a friendly way (making guest feel comfortable) is to me is a positive point for the hotel and staff.

Just remember that it is a five star hotel and somethings can be very expensive. You just have to be prepared for that. They do charge for every little thing no matter how much money you are spending there but that should not be surprising. I say it in case that you think exceptions are made. they aren't.

in summary: A beautiful place to stay, excellent food and top class service. Judith and her team are excellent and i would highly recommend considering this hotel for a high spec super service wedding! We will he back here for sure and wonderful memories (for us and our guests) of our special day are in part thanks to La Florida and the staff!",5,2017,02,19
28,Best view overlooking Barcelona!,"Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel with their spectacular view of Barcelona.  

The food was very good and their fine dining room at night was great!  The big attraction though is the view and at night, the lights of Barcelona are mesmerizing and romantic.  

They have a indoor/outdoor pool separated by large windows so you can enjoy the heated pool while watching the view.  

They have a nice workout area close to the pool and the rooms are old style European flavor but with enough modern conveniences like a heated towel rack in the bathroom, massive window doors to the outside.  

The hotel is at the top of the Mtn so it takes 20-30 minutes to get down to the town and the hotel provides a shuttle.  This is not walking distance from town.  They also get strong winds and it can get very cold.  There are a couple of sites to see nearby that provide more views of the city.

The one BIG piece of advice is to connect with the concierge (s) as soon as often as possible!  They provided so many great places to visit, eat, how to arrange transportation etc!  They 'made' the trip!!  We had off the menu items such as local favorites for winter, calots etc.  Can't thank them enough!",5,2017,02,15
28,Outstanding!,"We had such a wonderful and delightful a time everything was perfect everybody so kind with the kids. Excellent service at all levels, the food was very good both at the barcelonas and the cafe 1925. The massages were very good. We spent an excellent journey for four nights thanks to all the hotel personnel.",5,2017,02,14
28,Fantastic hotel ,"What a Fantastic place to stay for a weekend break , great food, staff can't do enough for you , facility's are great ,  the only down side is if you want to go to the ramblers it's a 20 min drive away in a taxi , ",5,2017,02,13
28,"Stunning location, excellent service","My husband booked this stay as a surprise birthday gift for me and, wow, what a treat! From the moment we stepped through the doors we treated to such a high level of service but without any pretentiousness. All of the staff we encountered were so professional but also warm & friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. Special mentions to Roger & David who were delightful & so very helpful! 
We had a spacious corner room on the fifth floor with fabulous views of the city & coast - I imagine the view of the sunrise would be spectacular though unfortunately the weather was mainly grey & wet whilst we were there so we didn't get to experience this. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom well equipped with enormous shower cubicle, good size bath and a plentiful supply of fluffy white towels.
We enjoyed using the spa every day of our visit, 2 out of the 3 days we had the whole area to ourselves - what a fabulous treat! This is a beautiful facility and was immaculately clean. Just one small,suggestion that maybe plastic carrier bags could be provided for guests to put wet swimming costumes in to transport back their rooms.
We used the hotel's shuttle service each day and found this to be an excellent facility, a much nicer (& faster) experience than using a taxi or having to do bus, funicular, metro.
The only downside to staying in this hotel is the price of their food & drink, which was incredibly expensive, though I have to say everything we did order was of high quality and very tasty. As the hotel is so far out of the city with no other ""competition"" nearby I  feel they are slightly taking advantage and charging inflated prices, even for a 5star hotel.
Despite this I still feel this hotel deserves top marks as it excels in every other aspect of what it is offering. I would love to stay again and would definitely recommend this as a wonderful place to stay as a special treat.",5,2017,01,29
28,Beautiful hotel with the view of Barcelona.,We stayed in this hotel in a presidential suite for some days... It has a massive beautiful rooms with the view of the city of Barcelona.. One room have jacuzzi outside and also with the view of the city. The breakfast were very good with many varieties of food. The hotel is outside the city center but they have shuttle with schedule.. taxi are also available and its not that expensive. But for 5 stars luxury hotel some service were missing  and some staff are not friendly and if you have dog you need to carry it while you are in the lobby.,5,2017,01,09
28,Stunning views and excellent service,"What can I say about my experience during my stay at this simply amazing hotel? It's luxurious without seeming pretentious and everything from the meals in the restaurant to the service and personal touch the moment you step inside is out of this world. The truth is, as I write this I am still vacationing here and I enjoying it very, very much. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",5,2017,01,08
28,How to get relaxed in a big city,"If I have to say something about how to get relaxed in a big town as Barcelona after visite the city, this is the right place. We enjoy our trip and our selection in this comfortable Hotel. This Hotel is not in middle of Barcelona it is just in top of the mountain next to the city, from your room you can get an impressed image of Barcelona in full with the see in the Horizon. Just Perfect.",5,2017,01,04
28,great location for a relaxing weekend!,"nice location aprox. 10 minutes taxi- or cardrive away from the city. nothing for business but amazing location for a relaxing weekend, location and the views are stunning! we had a very nice equiped corner room with balcony and terrace facing city and the sea. bathrooms are great but the rooms in general are not on todays standart. very charming, friendly and professional staff!",4,2017,01,02
28,Disappointing ,"What a shame, stunning location for views - albeit theme park next door!
Thought we would venture up for brunch on the terrace, the hotel almost seemed closed, very poorly staffed, news years celebrations still visible with uncleared tables and areas.
Not one member of staff attended to us and after 45 mins, not even a drink.
Expressed our disappointment to one of the 2 staff members that we actually saw and quite frankly they could not of cared less.
Hotel does not deserve the custom and definitely not worth the taxi trip to this far out location, much better things to do in Barcelona and the staff do not reflect the normal excellent hospitality experienced in the town.",1,2017,01,02
28,Disastrous trip to Barcelona,"If you are going with your family please avoid staying in this hotel. To start with despite charging so much for rooms the hotel qoutes €96 one way from the airport. The hotel lies on a hill far away from Barcelona city and far away from the airport. The view are excellent but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the vicinity. This allows the hotel to charge heavily for anything and everything you buy from the hotel. It provides a ""free"" shuttle service to and from the city but when we booked the last return shuttle back to the hotel it never arrived. No one informed us to say it will not come to pick us up . My my wife and 2 kids were stranded in cold rainy weather for 2 hours waiting for it until I rang them and they said the shuttle is out of order which we believe was a lie. They just didn't turn up because we were the only 4 booked in on that return trip . Also their last return  shuttle was at 4.30 pm from the city . Now who would want to return back to the hotel so early but this trick is so you have an expensive dinner in their hotel.
I would rather pay more and stay in a hotel close to Barcelona city than stay in the middle of no where in this hotel whose customer service is close to appalling. 
PLEASE AVOID PAYING EXTORTIONATE MONEY IN THIS HOTEL. 
You will also end up with unexpected bills before you check out .",1,2016,12,25
28,Great stay,"Great views, great building, great service... Excellent stay!
It was my first time in the hotel and I would definetly go back! I booked a room with views over Barcelona and it was amazing!
Also, I got breakfast at 7.00 (I had to wake up early) and I was surprised with the views from the restaurant... I saw the best sunrise ever!!",5,2016,12,01
28,The view is worth the trip!,"Beautiful hotel up on the hills above Barcelona. Upper floor rooms that look out at the city below are spectacular! Great restaurants, rooms and amenities. Long cab ride into the heart of the city or the boardwalk but worth the cost.",5,2016,11,30
28,Lovely setting,"Lovely setting, looking down over Barcelona. The staff were all very friendly and efficient.I stayed here with a friend , we were extremely comfortable in our room, slept like tops!! Although my friend had booked this trip many months ago for my birthday surprise......a twin room, with sea views. In reality we got a double room with a view of the sea if you stood outside on the balcony and looked round to the right, A different room was not on offer when we rang through to reception, the best they could do was get the bed made up with separate bedding for us.We loved the large bathroom (never seen such a big shower cubicle) with great toiletries. We used the large swimming pool each day which was good, the  jacuzzi could have been warmer.
I wouldn't stay here again because it was so far out of the city( 20 euros taxi ride one way), although my friend said she would, having been to Barcelona a few times she thought it was nice to have peace and quiet out of the city.
The hotel does offer a free minibus run to the city.......3 buses a day, 10am, 12 noon and 4pm. They return from the city half an hour later. You have to book a seat on the bus. We arrived on a Tuesday and tried to book for Wednesday or Thursday, but could only get on the Friday 10am bus. 
We did use public transport some of the time. There is a service bus that stops near the hotel every half hour, this takes you about 5 kms down the hill to the Funicular railway, get on that and then catch the metro into the city. Works well when all the components 'slot together'. That trip was 3 swipes on our 10 trip public transport ticket that we bought.There is also another service bus that stops near the hotel, it goes straight into the city centre so is the best bet, but it didn't seem to have a set timetable....cost for that trip was under 2 euros. The hotel staff didn't mention any of these alternatives to get down to the city, and were surprised when we said we'd used them!
Food and drink was expensive. 6 euros for a coffee.",4,2016,11,22
28,Up above Barcelona an oasis of calm,"Been here for business for two nights. Marvellous location and property. Spacious room, unforgettable view over the city and the pool. Staff extremely efficient and friendly.

The largest shower cabin I have seen, with all the comfort. Amenities by l'Occitane en Provence. 

Truly splendid!",5,2016,11,21
28,Partner Dinner (no overnight stay),"super nice location and views over the city, parking however was not good as we where only there for dinner.
The dinner location itself for the group was to narrow and to noisy, food was ok, dessert was the best.
Wine was verdejo menade 👍 and the red i did not test.
If you organize a group dinner here , check location before and don't take the one next to the pool.",3,2016,11,20
28,"Dubious cleanliness, appalling service","Pleasant staff and luxurious hotel, on the surface only. 

The room's and amenities' cleanliness are dubious to say the least. The room had a sizable spider web that looked like it had been there a while (see attached picture). In addition, one of the windows had condensation so bad in between the double glazing that you couldn't see through. The shower smelled of mold and had a displaced tile, the sink was blocked, a skirting board had fallen off by the bath. In the function rooms, there was a dead spider that remained there for the two days we were there (attached picture). 

Icing on the cake, the service is appalling. At check in, my leaving date was confirmed as the correct one but the length of stay was miscalculated and was short by one night. The check in assistant corrected the mistake and charged me (apparently provisionally) for the whole length of stay. On the last day at around 4 pm, I was asked rather brutally  to pack my things and vacate the room as the next tenant was waiting for it. The person who had checked me in when I arrived denied that he had told me that I could have the room for the entire time I was in Barcelona, he said he only took note of the change, yet charged me for the whole stay. I checked in together with someone else who also understood that I had the room for the whole time, yet the check in assistant still denied this. To make matters worse, no alternative solution was offered. The hotel was full and they did not find me an alternative hotel, just asked me to leave. The cleaning ladies were waiting outside the room for me to leave while I was packing my things. 

Only one positive thing, the staff in the restaurant are lovely. This does not apply to the staff in the cafe. The waiter we had when we ate at the cafe had no patience and was rude.  

I would never stay at this place again nor recommend it.",1,2016,11,15
28,The best,"I have stayed in many hotels...however...never had such a great service...

Very comfortable

Even recommendations about where to go in barcelona were spot on

Amazing view

Good price

Made you feel like it was your home.

Thanks to all staff at the hotel",5,2016,11,14
28,Great Hotel – Unfortunately it has limited facilities and too few staff.,"Just back from Barcelona, staying in the Gran Hotel La Florida.  I stayed there from Saturday 5th to the 8th November with my 3year old daughter.
Let me start with the positives:
The hotel is lovely and all the staff were wonderful and treated my 3 year old daughter like a princess.  The views from the hotel are spectacular.  The pool area and the Café 1925 is fantastic.  The Shuttle service and the driver are first class and the same applies to the reception staff.
All sounds fantastic…right, I’m sorry to say it’s not.  Please let me explain.
I will start by saying that I understand that I am staying at this lovely hotel at an off peak time and understand that the hotel is not fully occupied and needs to be staffed accordingly, but it really needs more staff as the Hotel was like a ghost hotel, far far too few staff, with the staff that were present run off their feet.  
I regularly went to the bar and found no one was about, in fact, I was only able to buy one drink directly from the bar in all my stay.  The second drink, the day I was leaving had to be ordered through the reception staff.  Only the restaurant was open.
All of my time in the pool (Pool was far too cold and not great to see bottles of wine at the side of the pool in the morning) with my daughter, I only ever seen the maintenance man fixing electrics, no staff around the pool to help.  I went looking for accessories for the pool for my daughter…yep, back to the reception.
The Reception staff run of their feet and having to deal with multiple customers, phone calls and requests from other staff.  My expectation when going to this area is that I would need to wait and also that I would be interrupted.  I understood and accepted this situation as the staff were fantastic but they are very, very stretched. Unfortunately this did take up a huge amount of my holiday and it really irritated me.
Very Limited facilities at this hotel, Café 1925 was closed down on my second day and breakfast moved without notification to the restaurant that was closed on my first day. So really only one very expensive restaurant open for eating at any time.
So to sum up the facilities, very few, very limited and they certainly do not cater for children, there is nothing for them to do at this hotel.  The outdoor bar I was told was open but no one is ever at it, so I could not get served.  The small indoor bar in the seating area I did not see open.
The Shuttle service and the driver are first class however that is if you can get on the three trips a day (10, 12:30 and 3pm) as it only takes 6 people, very very Poor considering the hotels location.  The amount of guests trying to book the service is pretty much all guests.  Having seen some disgruntled guests and this is low season imagine what it is like in high season.  This needs to be addressed by the hotel.  I struggled with my luggage as my flight was in the evening and did not want to travel around Barcelona with luggage and a three year old.
I was able to use the service twice on the way down to Barcelona and it is a great service and help the hotel if opened up to more trips.  The view from the staff is you get a Taxi around 30 to 40 Euros.  
This was highlighted by the fact that no print offs exist on how to get public transport or the fact that there is funicular on the mountain that is a great experience.  Travel by public transport take about 1 hour 30min, Message to the hotel, do an A4 printed sheet on how to get to Barcelona because your guest do use public transport.  I travelled with many of them.  On the sheet explain that the bus stop you need is the one up the mountain and that the 111 bus goes up and over the mountain.  Also that you should buy a T10 ticket or have small notes or coins
This hotel would be fantastic for a romantic getaway but certainly not for families.  If you are staying at the hotel do your home work first.",3,2016,11,12
28,A Jewel heading downwards,"Great views from the rooms. Lying in bed your view gazes accross Barca to the Med. The Restaurant Barcelona has incredible service! Not so in the Restaurant Cafe 1925. The interior design is not what you expect. The waiter would bring all courses simoutaneously, and luke warm instead hot. No clue of wines what so ever but felt competent to pick one... On weekends there are car races up the mountain til early morning..pretty loud...cab for 5 from downtown no problem...not so from the Hotel. Even when ordered two hours before, they'd call a few minutes before depature that their cab company did not have one available right now...the driver told me, they simply don't own one. Billing was a nightmare. I ordered the same breakfast every morning, billing varied every day. They refused to straighten it out and now one month later i find more deducts on my credit card statement. Sauna bench was fixed with cheap wood, turkish bath closed for good...the place is very sadly going down hill. Personnell ist trying hard, management does not seem to care.",5,2016,11,11
28,Stunning views but could and should be so much more ...,"So before I start, I've stayed at this hotel more than 6 times in the last 12 years.  The following is an honest and somewhat disappointing appraisal of what was once an outstanding hotel.  My last stay was in 2014 and I was looking forward to taking my daughters back to my favourite european city.

It felt more Fawlty Towers that a modern 5* hotel.

As a multi time visitor to this hotel I've had first hand experience of the changes over the years. I have to say that this visit did not impress me for a 5* hotel. Its most definitely gone downhill over the last few years. 

DAY 1 / Checkin: Arrived early (at 11.30) - not really a problem, we went for a swim and some lunch and was told that ""they'd come find us if the room was available before the 3pm checkin"". They didnt come and find us.... Arrive back at the front desk at 3pm. Room not ready. Just a few minutes Mr xxxx -- no problem, we'll wait here (reception). After 20 minutes, they go chase house keeping again after a prompt by me (I've two small children travelling with me since 5am and by this point we want a shower before we go out!). No problem, just one minute they are ""cleaning the windows"". A further 25 minutes .... I walk the few metres to the reception to chase again - - no not ready. So, we leave the few small items we have and we go out to the fairground to make the most of the day. Thanks for keeping me and my small children sat in reception for 45 minutes. No apology, no glass of wine, no drinks for the children. Mediocre check-in experience. Return after a excellent few hours at the nearby attraction to be met by the same person who'd basically span me a line at checkin. He did take the time to gesture to his colleagues with raised eyebrows and a shrug of the shoulders when he saw me approaching - nice professional touch. We are shown to the room by the said person - all cocky now the room is ready (its now 8pm) only to open the door and find that the room is made up for a couple - no beds for my children. So here we go again, housekeeping contacted and we sat for a further 30 minutes as beds were wheeled in, made up etc. Beds - rollup Z-BEDS and definitely not the proper single beds on the website photos. After such a long day my daughters opted for room service and I have to say that Felippe who took the order and delivered a not bad table of food for us all was a refreshing change on my experience so far. 

Day 2 / Breakfast So we decided to have room service for breakfast (why in this day and age is tea and coffee facilities NOT in the room of a 5* hotel). 75 euros for the three of us -- I'm sure I saw the highwayman ride past. It was 10 euro's more expensive for breakfast than dinner in the room the night before. Don't get excited ... 75 euros for tea, 3 bowls of average fruit and a few danish ... Unbelievably outrageous pricing. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel again. 

Day 2 / Poolside The poolside terrace is pretty nice. The pricing is verging on the obscene. 6 euro's for a tea bag ? 6 euros for a machine made coffee ? Really ? No wonder so few people use these facilities at the hotel during the daytime.

Day 2 / Pool Area Wow - how this has deteriorated over the years so I'll keep this brief. Mens changing room - 2 of the three toilets not working (one out of order sign up, one toilet seat hanging off like some video game) Mens changing room - no toiletries in the shower post ""gym session"" Mens changing room - no cold water in the cold water dispenser.. Mens changing room - Blocked of steam room (used to be there) but tatty and scruffy area left behind. Gym - definitely not a gym, a collection of machines poolside and tucked into a broom cupboard

Day 2 / Travel into town It continues .. Book the shuttle bus, alas you cant its fully booked for the next two days. Now I was confused as I've always found the shuttle bus half empty .. turns out the bus has been downsized to something around 6 seater size. Yes, a 6 seater. Never mind, I'll get a cab - appreciate we are a bit out of the way. Confidently told 10 minutes so sure enough we head to reception in ten minutes. Two taxi's waiting .. (for guests that are presumably elsewhere). Told my taxi is on its way. We wait and wait, a further twenty minutes I go ask again. The two taxi's that were here on my arrival at reception are still here with two increasingly irrate drivers. Its on its way -- now a full 35 minutes from the order. During this time I watched in excess of 20 taxi's drive past the front door available to hail. (more on this comedy in a second). Eventually I approach the first waiting cab - who is happy to take my fair, I get in and leave. We have a lovely evening in Barcelona, great food and we come back to nothing out of the ordinary. 

Day 3 / Money change So day 3, we've done our morning swim and sit in the sun and we are heading into Barcelona for walk around and dinner. I order a cab 30 minutes before I want it :-) (getting good at this) and head to reception to get it - a few minutes early as I want to change money (GBP to Euro). Approach reception, explain that I want to change a few hundred GBP to euro's. The less than helpful front desk/concierge person advises me theres a 20-30 minute way. I guess I misheard so I repeated my request in case he thought I wanted something different. He looked at me and said ""30 minutes"", turned around a walked off. I was a little speechless - no explanation - 30 minutes and lump it attitude from the staff. Clearly I've never waited for 30 minutes for someone to change money in a 2* hotel let alone a 5* hotel. Never mind, lets go get our cab. Yes, you guessed - not here.... so we wait for 10 minutes during which time, taxi's doing drop off for the cathedral a few hundred metres up the hill are returned and driving past empty. I ask the bell why he cant simply walk 10 metres to the road and hail a cab .. ""he cant, rules"". I wait a further 3 minutes ... No cab. Walk a few metres from the front door hail a cab, get in and leave - total time taken less than 30 seconds. I have no idea what the ridiculous scenario is regarding taxis. 

So, there you have it... 1700 euros for 3.5 days.. Sorry - but you've had the last of my money until you seriously buck your ideas up.

The positives, the views are outstanding.",3,2016,11,08
28,Stunning boutique hotel atop Tibidabo,"A luxury hotel with breathtaking views over the highest point in Barcelona.

28,A beautiful hotel that will make you smile every time you think of it,"Ok this hotel sells itself as Provence in Barcelona. Why not go to Provence then ??? Because this hotel is amazing with breath taking views over an amazing city. Just book, you will be delighted!!!!! It's such a cliche but even the air is different at this hotel. When you arrive you will be thinking why am I staying at the top of a mountain but just do it. ",5,2016,11,01
28,Great BCN views,"Relaxed atmosphere, top service, reasonable prices. 

Unbeatable views of the city. Summer sunset hours are good time to use the stainless steel indoor/outdoor pool, followed by a light dinner. 

Only handicap is distance to city center is not under 20minutes. ",5,2016,10,21
28,Room at the top,"Rooms are great, even a bit too big.     Super powerful rain shower.  Great staff.

Best was the cooks efforts to create special vegan dishes for me.   Not only tasty and ethical but a great way to open the conversation on animal mis treatment.   Even in SPAIN.

Just a slight downside.   The plumbing fixtures needs a bit of TLC.",4,2016,10,19
28,Decent property with a stunning view,"The hotel is situated very exclusively on Tibidabo. Our Junior Suite, that we were allowed to check into early, was very spacious and had great views of the city. Most of the interior was stylish and modern. The bathroom impressed me at first sight with its marble design, however the lacking bathroom door really bothered me later on. The outdoor pool despite being heated seemed a bit cool during our stay in winter, but the indoor pool was ideal for swimming a few laps. Unfortunately, the spa facilities seemed to be closed during our stay and appeared to be a bit outdated anyways. Contrarily, the gym was in a very good condition. In the evening we enjoyed a tapas dinner at the bar, which was really good. The choice (both sweet and savory) at the breakfast buffet was great.

28,Our dream wedding :),"23rd of September my & my husband got married in Barcelona. And we had our reception and dinner with party at the Gran hotel La Florida. I was in touch with Sara (the wedding manager) from the start, and she was a dream to be in contact with. She did everything we wanted, and then some. We had the dinner in the Cafe 1925 with the most crazy rain, thunder and lightening outside after we arrived. Almost felt like the Beauty and the beast movie theme. Even with this unexpected challenge everything went according to plan, they got all our guests inside to the lobby/bar area.  And after dinner everything cleared up. The food here is amazing, and the service is  so perfect. I could not have asked for more. Also the hotel has a very special atmosphere <3 We will be back soon.",5,2016,10,17
28,Quait hotel with lovely views of Barcelona.,"We stayed here for 2 nights, just a quick city break, and it was lovely. The room was huge, bed super comfy and the views over the city were beautiful. I'm not sure it's really a 5 star hotel but it is a very nice one. Good place to stay, costs about 20-25 Euros in a taxi from the city centre. The staff are really very nice here and overall we loved our stay here and would return.",4,2016,10,17

28,Checked out after 1 hour - awful service,"I booked 2 rooms and the presidential suite , all confirmed in advance 
1 week before my stay I wrote to the concierge to book my dinners and activities and did not receive a response for 4 days and all my preferred restaurants were fully booked due to their delays 

Arrived at the hotel in the afternoon to be told that's my room was not ready and was not offered anywhere to stay or change or shower so I had to go to town -25 Euro taxi for a late lunch 

When I return after another 25 euro taxi I was handed a room key not escorted to my room not shown the amenities and not advised of any hotel services 

On entering the room I excitedly wanted to check out the jacuzzi ( the main reason I booked this hotel ) only to find a grimy old mouldy empty jacuzzi that was broken and if someone sat it in they would be cut by the ridiculously unsafe sharp plastic inserts that had decayed due to lack of cleaning 

I was advised someone would come and fix it but no they sent someone to come and fill it , I told them I can't use it so again they sent someone to fix it , he looked at it and said he can't fix it. 

I advised the staff that I wanted to speak to a manager , no one came, I advised them I wanted to check out as if I could not use the jacuzzi I would rather stay in a more central location . They simply did not care . They completely messed up all my reservations and their food is awful and when you call reception often you don't get an answer cause they are under staffed and under equipped 

Sad state for what used to be such a lovely hotel",2,2016,10,06
28,What a Find!!,"Arrived in Barcelona to find out we had been let  down by our Last Minute Booking agent .!.and had nowhere to stay. With BFC playing at Home , we were really struggling to find some where decent to stay , until the Airport Travel Agent suggested Gran Hotel la Florida. A 25 minute (30 euro) Taxi trip later found us, at the highest point over looking the city in a stunning location, with even more stunning views, especially from the Terrace Bar !. I would absolutely recommend this Hotel, it has a slightly quirky feel ,with excellent staff , we could not fault it!",5,2016,10,05
28,Amazing Views! Pleasant Staff and all round good Hotel,"The hotel is excellent, Amazing views of the city! Great people working there! All round a good break for me and my young family!
Had a few issues with our room, but they were sorted after a few phone calls to the reception. We had a Deluxe Family room with views of the side/front. A/C controls were a bit on the dated side, so could do with an upgrade for 5* standards. Bathrooms were more than adequate. Hotel in general is well decorated but could do with a few upgrades and maintenance. Being in the Construction/refurbishment industry I noticed these defects, however regular customers may not.
The design of the pool area incorporated indoors as well as out is very nice. all clean and well serviced.
Food at the pool bar and 1925 restaurant more than adequate, could do with a bit more choice on dishes, but all tasteful and very filling.
The free shuttle service into the city is very nice of the hotel,the driver Moranao was very pleasant and very knowledgeable of the city and sites to see. Great Asset to the hotel. It's 15-20 min drive to centre of town, however cabs do come regularly to the area and only charge 20 euros one way.
Hotel arranged a transfer service to and from the hotel and airport. Very pleased with this service. bit of confusion on the return leg, but all was resolved.
Overall very pleased with our hotel choice and would defiantly stay again!",5,2016,10,04
28,A good hotel with potential to be epic,"We recently stayed at the hotel Gran La Florida and had a very good time overall, but I must admit that my expectations fell short from other LHW experiences. Before I begin, I would like to warn everyone that it is quite far from the city center, despite looking otherwise on the map. However, I only realized after a couple of days that taxis (no Uber) were cheap (not like the rest of western Europe), so it might not be such an annoyance for some. 

Anyway, aside from the remoteness, the location is magnificent. You must get a room with a city view as there is nothing that would compare! The mountain is littered with all kinds of trails with great vistas, which is something that I loved as an avid hiker (luckily I had my boots because you need them for parts). 

The hotel itself is a beautiful building, complete with just about every amenity that one would want. Although a bit pricey (EU 35), the breakfast was absolutely delicious, filled with a variety of just about everything you can imagine (including sparkling wine). Our room was very nice, the bed extremely comfortable, and the towels, robes, and toiletries (generous amounts from L'Occitane) were fabulous. Certain details of the room were a little worn down (stain on the curtain, broken corner on a piece of furniture, among a couple other things), which is something that didn't bother me, but which definitely surprised me. 

The service is the area that could use the most improvement. Upon arrival, the doorman was extremely polite (first speaking in Spanish, but also offering English, and then when he saw the French tag on the car, offered French to my girlfriend - and remembered so throughout our stay); I feel really bad that I don't remember his name but he was a stellar employee and an example of how people staying in a hotel like this should be treated. On the other hand, his colleague (a man with glasses) was extremely rude during our check-in and made it extremely difficult to just get through with it quickly (falsely saying that I had 2 reservations  and implying that I had to pay for both); he was a little friendlier throughout the rest of the trip, but this guy I think is better suited for a Best Western. When get got to the room we realized there was no wine glasses, so I called room service to bring some up; they never came. The next morning at breakfast I ordered eggs, they never came. There were several small instances, and there was also a woman who worked during the day (with glasses) who was quite friendly and helpful, so it's not everyone. 

My opinion is that I think that the hotel is a little too commercialized/corporate, which if changed, would change a great experience into an unforgettable one.",4,2016,10,01
28,Just amazing!,"Just loved the view, the beautiful rooms with balconies, the restaurant and everything about it!

It's perched on the top of Mount Tibidabo ... and when I say the top, I mean really at the very top. It took our taxi driver awhile to find the hotel when we arrived in Barcelona. It was around midnight and the ride up the winding mountain to La Florida was exciting and slightly spooky... passing through castle like buildings along the way and looking up at a majestic church in the darkness all just added to the thrill of finally arriving to this hidden gem. My tip, make sure you do some research for the location if you're driving there.

It costed about 35€ from the airport to La Florida hotel for our ride but it should be 8-10€ less if your driver knows the way.

The service, food and ambience was just marvellous and getting to the city centre waas not too difficult. There's a bus stop close but a taxi trip was only 10-12€.

I will definitely return for another visit.",5,2016,09,28
28,What a spot,"If it's a quiet, peaceful spa location above this beautiful city then this is your option. It's very relaxing, great staff, nice common areas, large rooms although not luxurious well kitted with lovely l'Occitaine cosmetics. The city is only 15 drive away and it's worth the distance for the tranquillity.",4,2016,09,26
28,AMAZING! Amazing Views,"Amazing views, Will always love this hotel as my boyfriend proposed to me here.

Good points:
Hotel clean, lovely staff, rooms were amazing, we had an amazing balcony looking over the whole of Barcelona.

Pool and outside area are great

Breakfast nice but again expensive

Bad points:
Dinner was amazing but wasn't enough of it and was very expensive, nice wine but expensive again.
Also it was a good 20 mins taxi journey, the hotel kindly put on a shuttle in the day time but at night had to pay for a taxi which was about 25 EUROS one way

Would highly recommend for an amazing trip",4,2016,09,21
28,Amazing ,"Beautiful hotel, brilliant service and food was fantastic.  Thank you Lucas and all the concierge, restaurant and bar team.  You made us feel so special.  We miss you already and will be returning.  Fantastic hotel made extra special by the people that work there.  Views outstanding and the room was beautiful.  We stayed in a junior suite with mountain views but all the views from anywhere in the hotel are fantastic.  Can not understand any negative comments about this hotel it's outstanding five star hotel with Rock star service. ",5,2016,09,19
28,Lovely hotel and sorroundings,The hotel was clean and the customer service was excellent. The food was ok on the menus at the hotel but we ate out in the town so it wasn't a problem.  The brekfast was lovely. We would definitley stay here again as it is very high up so it is peaceful and there are beautiful surroundings. There is a free car service on selected morning  times to take you into barcelona which is very good of the hotel. The hotel is near an old fashioned fairground and funicular which is definitely worth going too. ,5,2016,09,15
28,AMAZING VIEW,"I stayed 2 nights in the city then booked this hotel for 2 nights to relax, I booked a deluxe room with a city/sea view and WOW !!!!!   what an amazing view, very friendly staff, beautiful pool, the room was a bit dated but was fine and the bed was so comfy we didn't want to leave. 
We pre-booked a table for the evening meal and had the most amazing view over the whole of Barcelona.
100% would return",5,2016,09,14
28,One of the most amazing hotels I have stayed in for many years,"I was here on a business trip with a group of 25 people. The accommodation, food and facilities were very good. The views were amazing as we could see right over all of Barcelona. Probably one of the most impressive factors of the hotel was the extraordinary service- everyone from lobby staff, reception to restaurant to the conference manager Judit were very helpful and nothing was too much to ask. I would certainly recommend this hotel for both business and personal trips and will be considering staying here when I return with my gamily in October!",5,2016,09,13
28,What a view,"Quite a distance from the heart of the city,but well worth the trip up to Hotel. The view is amazing, the whole of Barcelona spread out in front of you. Charming staff, who were very professional and extremely helpful at all times.We had a mountain view room, which was lovely as it got the evening sun and we were able to sit out on our balcony and enjoy a relaxing drink. The room was a great size, with an enormous and very comfortable bed. The  bathroom was wonderful, with loads of fluffy towels, bathrobes and complimentary slippers. Lovely L'Occtaine shampoos etc. Breakfast, which could be taken on the terrace, was fabulous, with a huge range of very tasty food available. The swimming pool was a good size and just the correct temperature in such hot weather. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2016,09,09
28,SUPERB,"We have just returned from 3 nights at the Florida . Overall it was excellent although one or 2 little negatives.
We have stayed at many 5* hotels and this is now one of our favourites.
On the negative side , our room was a little neglected , cracked tiles and the balcony door hanging off. Mini bar fridge very dated .Also strange was no shower doors where clearly there had been previously ?? but one of the most comfortable beds ever and a huge room .
On the positive side , the staff were excellent , the service superb the location is stunning  it was so relaxing . Be prepared to pay around 20 euro for a taxi into Barcelona as it is a way out of the city .
Yes it is expensive to eat and drink but you get what you pay for .... a fantastic break . Will return without doubt",5,2016,09,07
28,Terrible security! Even worse customer service! Awful!!,"I stayed at Gran Florida hotel in May .. I was travelling alone and had been recommended to the hotel.. I booked to stay for 5 nights.. On arriving at the hotel I was very impressed it smelt amazing and the lobby area was very inviting so I had high expectations.. 
I was shown to my room,again I was impressed it was light,airy and spacious.. I went downstairs to have drinks by the pool (which is lovely) as a woman travelling alone I was very aware of security and on first impressions I did feel safe.. 
I spent whole of next day sunbathing by the pool..the service at the pool bar was very good and staff were attentive and friendly..
The next day I decided to go sightseeing in the city so left my room early to catch the bus down the hill in to the centre.. I was gone all day from 11am until 8pm on returning to my room I realised my door was open!.. I went in (leaving the door open behind me!) to check my belongings nothing appeared to be touched but I gave reception a call to alert them as to what had happened they were horrified and couldn't apologise enough explaining that the cleaner had 'forgotten ' to shut it behind her.. I was not happy at this explanation and asked to speak to the manager 'Cristina roures' they said she was not in the hotel but would come and find me first thing in the morning when she came back in... I felt edgy that night in the room alone.. The next morning I waited by the pool until 11.30am .. No one arrived.. I then went to reception to ask if she was available only to be told she was still not in but would see me later on that day.. I went out again sightseeing on the tour buses for the rest of that day returning at 9.30pm only to find my door open again!! I did not go in this time instead I went straight to reception demanding someone came to my room with me to check it was safe.. I also asked if I could change rooms as i did not feel safe or secure it that room again only to be told there were none available.. And Cristina was still not in but would definitely be in in the morning.. I didn't sleep that night at all in fact I was so upset by the blatant lack of security or explanation that I booked flights to leave Barcelona the following day.. I was fully expecting to see 'Cristina roures' the following morning.. Again she was not in the hotel.. I was assured she would arrive soon ..My flight was booked for 4pm so I had to leave at 2pm to get to the airport by this time she had still not contacted or seen me!.. 
I left feeling very upset by the whole stay and total lack of compassion by the hotel staff.. As a single traveller I expect a certain level of security this was not the case at this hotel... On returning home I have emailed 'Cristina roures' countless times she has not responded to ANY of my emails... 
I am disgusted by her actions and the fact I've been completely ignored over an absolutely appalling stay in that hotel...

BEWARE!!!!!!",1,2016,09,05
28,Gorgeous views and luxury are worth the little downsides,"This luxury hotel in Tibidabo was a great place to start a week in Barcelona.  We stayed there for 2 of 7 nights.  I was surprised when I booked that it was not higher on the rankings of TripAdvisor.  I suspect this is in part because people do not realize that it is a bit remote from the sites of Barcelona.  As long as you go understanding this, it is an excellent choice. There is a shuttle from the hotel to Placa Catalunya, but it does not run that often, and needs to be booked ahead.  Taxis are slow to the site, and a bit expensive if you plan to use this as your base.  There is a base that stops in front of the hotel, though and goes right to Placa Catalunya.

The rooms were well-appointed, clean and had absolutely stunning city or mountain views.  We had both as we had a corner room.  Staff was helpful and friendly; most spoke English.The pool and outdoor areas were lovely as was the decor.  It is a very relaxing place to unwind after a long transatlantic flight.

The little downsides, apart from being remote from the city, included the lack of options for food (no options apart from the hotel, or going to the Tibidabo amusement park), and as such the cost was higher than it is in the city for equivalent quality.  We had the Express breakfast, rather than the buffet, and this was a good option.  

The only other piece of advice I would give those booking online is to beware of the various room categories.  We thought we were getting a balcony, and the bathroom shown online was quite a bit larger than the one we had, with two sinks and a window (though it was fine, just smaller). Given the price was the same for this type of room, we felt a bit cheated.  We could see that the rooms on 5th floor (highest for our room type) did not have balconies, while all other floors seemed to have them.  I would recommend that the hotel develop two categories within this group (with differential pricing) and be explicit about whether the room has a balcony, larger square footage and bathroom or not so that individuals booking are not disappointed.

Overall, though, I would return just for the breathtaking views from the room and the terraces.",4,2016,09,04
28,Away from the city but with great view,Located on a hill in the middle of a park with all the city at your legs it's a very good choice for some body who avoids the city traffic.Great rooms with excellent service and the opportunity of the free transport from the city center offers an amazing experience of Barcelona.,4,2016,09,03
28,THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD,"I have been staying at La Florida for on and off 15 years now. Have tried many - if not all - of the top 5 star hotels in Barcelona and nothing comes anywhere near to the experience here.

The rooms are sensational - large, spacious, well appointed and generous. The views are sensational - world class. The pool is magical.

I could just go on and on.

I promise that I do not work for them or are affiliated with them in any way at all - other than that I am a regular customer - and for very good reason.

The staff are the cherry on the cake. Helpful, attentive and genuinely care.

I can not recommend this any higher.

Pay the extra and get rooms with a view - it defeats the object of going not to.

Jorg in London",5,2016,09,01
28,Amazing stay!,"We were on a short family stay, and we decided to choose this hotel for its pool and for the position, overlooking the city, and last but not least a very good offer we've found... We've been reading some of the previous reviews, and we experienced that with some organisation (schedule, shuttle, city bus) the connections with downtown Barcelona are not bad at all... Maybe I would just suggest if the hotel could add another shuttle earlier in the morning and /or another one later in the afternoon/evening to make life even better for its guests.
The room was gorgeous, not to mention the bathroom, and the breakfast was fantastic!
Strongly recommended.",5,2016,09,01
28,Luxury hotel,"We spent three nights in this beautiful hotel.  Having traveled a lot I can say it was surely one of the best hotels I've ever been and for me for sure the best in Spain. La Florida exceeded my expectations in many means. The view over the city was stunning. The breakfast was absolutelly perfect, big choice, nothing was missing. The dinner on the terrace was very good as well ( reservation recommended). Deluxe room was spacious, huge bathroom with showers and bathtube. The bed was amazing, so comfortable pillows I' ve never had. Every night they brought water of Solan de Cabra and chocalates. 
The swimmingpools are really good and the water refreshing. There is a small room with cardio mashines, also few mashines at the pool. They could have some dumbbells as well, this what I missed, would be nice detail. So the ""gym"" was a bit disappointing, though enough for decent exercise.
The hotel provides a bus to the center, sadly only 3 times per day and you need to book it in advance , so we couldnt use that. Anyways we went by blue bus ( station just few meters away from hotel), which I guess only goes between center and Tibidabo when the atraction park is open. Within 30 minutes you will be on Plaza Cataluña and it costs you 3 euros. The bus goes every 20 minutes. But why to go to center if you already have booked this hotel...? Its a very relaxing place, the attraction  park close by is not disturbing at all. At the same time good place also for families, the kids can enjoy the pools and have fun in the park.
 We found few points that La Florida can do better. We needed to rebook a flight and they dont have computer to use. A 5*star Hotel could have one.
 The people at the reception were quite cold, not all of them though. So sometimes they could smile a little bit too.
All over I would recommend the hotel to everyone and return whenever back in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,28
28,Lovely stay for a special birthday,"We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel. Staff are really helpful, booking tickets & sorting boarding passes for return flights. Great buffet breakfast - the Bucks Fizz went down especially well. The rooms are lovely, especially those with views over the city.",5,2016,08,24
28,Wonderful,Had a great stay in this very nice hôtel 15 mins from center and with a stunning view on the city ! Staff was perfect everywhere and very professional! Would have enjoyed staying more than one night. Next time ! ,5,2016,08,21
28,A grand hotel overlooks Barcelona,"The Gran hotel La Florida offers the best of both worlds. Set on top of the Tibidabo hill it overlooks the city and its 5 star rating adds to the atmosphere of exclusivity. Yet it is only a short bus or taxi ride away from the vibrant city centre. The hotel rooms are spacious with high ceilings and tall windows. The facilities are luxurious with an indoor pool that extends out to the terrace and a gym and spa. We stayed on a breakfast inclusive basis and were not disappointed with the range and quality of food available. The freshly-squeezed orange juice is fantastic and in plentiful supply! This option allows a relaxed start to the day and plenty of time to sunbathe on the terraces before heading into Barcelona for a late lunch or evening meal. The hotel provides a complementary shuttle bus into Barcelona but there is also a frequent local bus service into the city, last bus back being 11.20 pm. The communal areas are beautifully appointed and air-conditioned, as are the rooms. Staff are always extremely polite and helpful and will happily advise you on the best places to go in Barcelona. A final advantage for us was the network of footpaths in the surrounding national parkland which are ideal for walking, running or mountain biking. We thoroughly recommend this hotel. To improve we would like to see tea and coffee facilities in the bedrooms. ",5,2016,08,14
28,Very far from the city,"Nice hotel with a beautiful swimming pool. However, it is not acceptable some big mistakes.
The restaurant close every sunday´s and monday´s. You don´t have a bar to relax a little after dinner. You only ca use the bar close to the swimming pool.
Nice breakfast but not for a gran lujo 5 Star hotel.",3,2016,08,13
28,Great Champagne,"Would like to thank the staff for a lovely stay
Trip was for my wife's 40th birthday and they made a very big effort to help in the celebration. Including the red roses in the room and the scattering of petals in and around the room oh and chocolates.
Service round the pool and decking area was also of high quality. Would come back again",4,2016,08,13
28,Final night in Europe,"After a week of traveling and exploring each and every day, arriving at this hotel was impressive, refined and a spectacular view.  The room was extremely comfortable.  having a room overlooking the city is a must!  The pools were very nice, dinner at the hotel was unforgettable.the tasting menu was a huge hit.  
I loved the décor, blending rich dark woods with waterfalls in the lobby.  Exquisite!",5,2016,08,09
28,"Wonderful, relaxing stay with beautiful views","Fed up with the rainy, English weather we booked this hotel on the spur of the moment for a lovely relaxing break and that is exactly what we got. A taxi from the airport got us to the hotel (which is 1800 feet above sea level!) within half an hour.  Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, delicious food, comfortable bed – what more can you ask for?  This hotel might not appeal to those who want razzmatazz and hub of the city, but for people looking to relax in comfort with unparalleled views across the city, then you couldn’t ask for more.  There is ancient theme park, built in the 1900’s nearby, which we felt only added to the charm of the region.  And behind the hotel, are spectacular views of the mountains.  The staff at Bar 25, were SO friendly – especially Hugo, whose smile and welcome made our holiday very special.  We will definitely return.",5,2016,08,09
28,Disappointing & Inconvenient,"Good point - unrivalled views of the coast & city. 

Bad points - location .... just too far from the city and beaches, requires a coach ride down to Catalunya and the a taxi to where ever you wish to go. That's at least 45 minutes in all. And then the return journey. 

The rest is underwhelming - a narrow swimming pool, very slow service from room service eg they routinely take around 15 mins to deliver bottled water, they took 20 minutes to collect our bags on check out. 

The restaurant is poor. We waited 45 minutes for a hot meal for 3 on our first night. The food came after my 11 year old daughter decided to go to our room instead and eat sandwiches we'd made in the UK ..... the food was cold, suggesting that the waiter had simply forgotten to serve which is odd because there was only one other hotel guest to serve. The worst part was a bill of 110 Euros for the cold food. On check out the hotel refused to reduce the bill to something more reasonable saying that we should not have eaten the food (bearing in mind this was at 10.30pm and was our first night and we were stuck up a hill at this hotel with no transport down to the city, this was a crass bit of advice). 

Also note that there is a lot of noise at night right up until 3.30am from guests down below (we were on the 5th floor) - restaurant or bar. And a lot of noise from the fair close to the church. 

Suffice to say, we will not stay here again.",2,2016,08,04
28,short stay,"We spent there just one night! Amazing view of BCN, large and very comfortable bed. The pool overlooking the city is quite unique, and we had an apertivo on the terrace with some tapas. Nice wines! Very nice and romantic lobby, ideal in winter time",5,2016,08,04
28,Grand but with lots of flaws,"Setting and decor is grand. However the management team needs to improve. Air con in our room was not working properly when we checked in. Took over 4 hours to work properly. Antoine was very poor in providing a 5 star service. Spoke to him about the air con and he pretended he can help. Came up to the room and tried to convince us that we left the door open or had the lights on so hence why room didn't cool down. Told him that the door was shut all the time. Asked him for an extra robe and an iron and board. Noted it down at 7.20 pm and told us it will be sorted. By 9.30pm no extra robe(was only provided with one initially) and no iron. Had to go to reception and spoke to Sergi who sorted out in a few minutes. 
No door leading to bathroom and toilet and staff would let themselves in and no do not disturb sign in the room. This is appalling. 
Food was overpriced for the quality. Very poor food at extremely high price. Don't mind paying but for better quality on the plate. Service was slow. Too slow for a five star. The current management team is a big let down. Such great potential being wasted.",1,2016,08,04
28,Visit every year - one of our favourite hotels in the world - Great base for the Formula 1 Grand Prix,"We travel a lot both for business and leisure and have very high standards and this place surpassed our expectations. The kids never want to leave, there are very few hotels with a spa and pool that allow children where as here they are allowed to use all of the facilities.",5,2016,08,01
28,Off the beaten path,"Location may not be the best if it's your first time in Barcelona. However, if you don't need to be in the city center it is great. Unbeatable views of the city throughout the day and night. Nice restaurant and spa. 15-20 minutes from the center depending on traffic. Highly recommended ",5,2016,08,01
28,Beautiful hotel with stunning view,"This hotel sits up on the mountains of Barcelona which gives you a spectacular view of the city. 

The breakfast buffé was really nice with complementary sparkling wine. Nice selection of salami and other meats. 

The hotel is about 3 minutes walk from the theme park Tibidabo. Great for kids but avoid Thursdays and Fridays as it gets really crowded.

The pool was really nice as it is both an outside and inside pool. So you can escape the sun if it gets too hot. There is also a big jacuzzi pool which was really nice. 

The rooms are elegant with a touch of classic design. 

I would really like to return to this hotel the next time we're in Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,30
28,Needs a refurb but lovely staff and big rooms,"The staff are fab and the view is amazing.  Best sunset view in barcelona hands down.
But the hotel needs a complete refurb.  
The interior design seemed to me to be a confusing mish mash of 10 styles from the 80s and I didn't find it pleasant to look anywhere inside.  The junior suite room was enormous but felt like an unloved spare room.  And there wasn't there a door on the bathroom.  It's a 30 minute drive from the port, so you really want to be away from the city centre to stay there. ",3,2016,07,25
28,Noisy 5star GL worth maximum 4 star,"La Florida has great views over Barcelona, however for those looking for a 5*GL it doesn't meet expectations at all, due to slow ( though friendly ) service at the pool restaurant and lobby, but above all, furniture and accomodation is worn out and tired. Main problem is that the hotel is situated right next to an attraction parc with, that was our case, lots of noice if the wind blows in the wrong direction. The accomodation, rooms and common rooms is worth a good 4* hotel but doesn't deserve , except for the service and quality of the Barcelonas restaurant the titel of 5* GL. We made our selection for the hotel guided by the fact that it overlooks, out of the city, Barcelona and hoped for a quiet stay ( that was NOT the case ) and the fact that it is a Member of Leading Hotels of the World, that we normally have perfect experiences with. Gran Florida should not be a LHW member as it doesn't offer what LHW stands for : class, impeccable service, historic environment, luxe, tradition and old world charm. A shame that by the pool and restaurant the staff is ""dressed"" in jeanshorts and tank-tops (?)... La Florida doesn't know what card to play : holiday-club with Spa , place for weddings and parties, a historic place ( only the outside gives an idea of what it used to be beginning 20th century ) and thus is nothing precise at all. ",2,2016,07,18
28,Terrible dinner service ,"We came to the restaurant at Florida for dinner. They had a barbecue night on so we had high hopes. There was 1 waiter for around 15 tables. Terrible service. The BBQ was not great at all. All the food was cold and very plain. Not impressed at all for £45 per person for some meat and dry boring vegetables...absolute disaster. The choice of salad was carrots, a quarter iceberg lettuce or tomato. ",1,2016,07,15
28,View!!!!,"When you stay at this hotel, you have Barcelona literally at your feet. Exclusive 5 stars hotel with very good service and elegant, spacious and comfortable  rooms. Excellent breakfast various and fresh, nice pool.",5,2016,07,15
28,Good but not quite great,"I've used this place for business on and off for the past 10 years during the working week and thought it would be nice to take the wife for a relaxing luxurious weekend. Everything is up there with the best but there was a shortage of staff. Took ages to get service, rooms were not cleaned till very late afternoon. Terrace bar and food service was extremely slow. A bit more attention to your customers needs and you would have a very compelling proposition. Otherwise thanks for a great weekend.",4,2016,07,13
28,Nice hotel but poor service,"This is the second time i've been to this hotel, so I wouldn't have returned if I didn't really like the hotel's rooms and view. What I will say however is that the service is poor and is not 5-star service. When we arrived for example they told us they overbooked and would have to relocate us to another hotel on the final day - which was fine but only to find out the room at their sister hotel did not match what we had paid extra for (ie a terraced room). The service at the hotel in terms of consistently mixing up drinks and food orders at the pool bar also did not help. We also a power cut in our room for half an hour. This is a beautiful hotel that if you catch them on a good day it's fantastic, but too often the service does not match up to the hotel itself. Here's a final example of this - they print international papers on A5 and staple them together (badly). What happened to the good old fashioned getting the International New York Times in it's proper format, printed - they seemed to get the Spanish papers ordered in OK.",4,2016,07,11
28,day at the spa,"Amazing hotel, interesting interior, fantastic views with lovely terraces.
6 of us spent the day at the hotel spa and the staff were really very good, I had booked a table foe a meal afterwards which was in great position with views out over Barcelona but the service really was not great, the staff tho' friendly just kept forgetting to bring us what we ordered, which really let the whole thing down, probably wouldn't go back and stay although the hotel its self was lovely",3,2016,07,06
28,Fantastic Views But,"We stayed at this hotel twice before and after going on a cruise the first time we arrived about 7pm and was shown to our room and other areas by a nice young man our room 106 was a great room with a very nice balcony with table and four chairs and two very nice loungers this was great as I am a smoker,bathroom very good and clean as for the room itself which was very good apart from a tatty dressing table and if you wanted to sit on a chair beware do not lean back as they would fall apart breakfast was very good also the pool areas are very good bar staff also good on the whole very good reception and polite.
Second visit back from our 6 star cruise MSC yacht club which was fantastic we arrived at the hotel early but they was informed we would be about 11.45am we was told the room was not ready which is understandable but informed by reception that they would have a word with housekeeping that we had arrived and try and get our room ready so we went to the pool area for drinks and a snack at about 2pm I asked if our room was ready and was told about another 30 minutes at 2.45pm I asked my girlfriend to check and spoke to a young man who said it is not company policy to allow guests in to a room until 3pm that made us feel unhappy but at 3.20pm I started to feel very unhappy but was shown to our room but the cleaners where still cleaning so we was asked to wait a little longer finally after another 15 minutes we was told the manager usually inspects the room before letting us in by then I was getting very upset and said sod the inspection and got our room 601 which was a fantastic room patio area you could have a party for 70 people on good outdoor furniture bubble pool although not working I dont think as it was empty but a very nice area and views to die for the room itself was fantastic as was the bathroom with a slipper bath and fantastic shower you could get 6 people in if kinky the bed was very good please Mr Manager get your cleaning staff to take the 2 weeks worth of dust from under the bed but the room and view was great.
Please put a couple of screws in the decking outside as if you trip it is a very long way down.
There is nothing around the hotel apart from a amusement park so we ate at the hotels outdoor area for our evening meal which is very good and we very much enjoyed the gambas 3 very large prawns very tasty with a few fries.
Be warned it is a long way up a very steep hill and costs about 45 euros from the airport and 35 euros to the cruise port.
On the whole if you can put up with a few niggles it is a very nice hotel with views to die for.
Please Mr Manager get your house in order as this could be a fantastic place and we will keep our eye on trip adviser to see if the niggles improve as we would love to revisit",4,2016,07,05
28,Rising above Barcelona,"Wonderful location, above the heat and fumes of Barcelona at its hotest. A 20 euro taxi from the centre but there is train and bus connection nearby. Rooms generous and v well appointed. 
Hotel has several offers on most of the time, ie 2 days for one. Staff excellent. Food on the terrace overlooking Barcelona equally excellent. Inside/outside infinity pool and spa etc.
And a really nuttso amusement park round the corner . . ,",5,2016,06,28
28,Extraordinary in every way,"After a stressful journey having experienced a 3 hour delay to our flight, we arrived at 2pm to a smiling, friendly welcome and with very little formality shown to our room. Talk about blown away! The room was huge, the bed enormous, the linen perfect. The bathroom was beautifully appointed with a truly vast shower, separate loo and bidet, double sinks and a bath. A good night's sleep ensued and we woke in the morning to find our own private terrace outside the french doors with 2 sunbeds and a table to seat 4. The terrace of the hotel looks out from on high over the city. The view is stunning both day and night. You can also see the Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor at Tibidabo from the terrace. This amazing structure is a short walk from the hotel. Whilst the buffet breakfast will prove somewhat disappointing for British visitors, the friendly and helpful staff will arrange for eggs to made the way you like them and for your coffee to be to your exact taste. We found all the staff in the hotel to be like this, offering excellent service without being servile. Everyone seems to be able to speak at least 4 languages! There is a rather limited menu for evening dining, but the quality of the food more than makes up for that. A wide variety of cocktails is also available from the terrace bar. An nicely appointed gym area is available for guests next to the pool which is excellent and a fabulous jacuzzi is adjacent. There is a shuttle to and from the city at various times during the day, but it is necessary to book in advance as places are limited. Don't hesitate to go to this hotel if Barcelona is on your list. It's definitely 5 star.",5,2016,06,17
28,Fabulous. One of the best.,"Stayed 3 nights in this outstanding hotel. Location - far from city center. But the view from the hill, fresh air, breeze and silence forces to choose it. The most romantic place. Room service perfect. Rooms were clean and prepared for the night. Breakfast fantastic. Shuttle service drivers were real professionals. Swimming pool (indoor and outdoor) was great. Would choose it again. Worth it.",5,2016,06,15
28,Amazing views,"The rooms provide an amazing view of Barcelona and the sea. it's situated just outside the city center in quiet place over a hill, which translates to a 20euros fare to go to center with a taxi. Great place to relax after a day of sightseeing in exciting. Rooms are modern as well as the spa. Good breakfast buffet.",4,2016,06,11
28,5 star location; 3 star service,"Lovely setting, beautiful views, generous sized rooms with stunning bathrooms.  However, the service from personnel in reception, bar and restaurants was appauling, not matching the expectation at all.  Such a shame!  No sense of urgency, priority or care.  Had to wait a long time for rooms to be sorted on arrival; had to return to bar to remind staff about drinks order; had dificults in clarifying charges to room bills; had to wait a very long time for food at lunchime.  The staff were never rude, just lacking in focus, care, concern and urgency.  With just a little training on customer care and responsiveness to customer needs, this hotel would be stunning.
Parking was a nightmare as most of the vistors to local amusement park seem to use the hotel for free parking.  Hotel very busy at w/ends with parties and visitors to local theme park, which was a bit noisy too.",3,2016,06,09
28,Great Staff & Amazing Views,"There are many pro's and con's to this hotel, but on the whole it is a unique offering within Barcelona. First and foremost, the staff throughout and very helpful - 5 stars for the staff.

A hotel with a view like this over Barcelona is going to mean 2 things - 1 it attracts people not from the hotel to come up to the communal arreas, and 2, it inevitably is quite a drive into Barcelona (about 20 minutes and 25 euros).

Having said that, it is a lovely hotel with great amenities and staff. So if you are after something different with Barcelona close-by and not on your doorstop, here it is.",4,2016,06,08
28,"Beautiful, but terrible service! ","Really beautiful hotel, definitely busy though as i guess lots of people come up for the views! Very modern, stunning rooms with gorgeous views over Barcelona. You are out of town, up a fairly long windy road, but I preferred this as Barcelona is so busy and touristy in the centre. Lovely church a 5 min walk away which is worth seeing. A bit strange as the hotel is situated next to an amusement park so you hear the rollorcoaster screams from the restaurant and by the pool! You get used to it though. 

Main problem is the horrendous service in the outdoor restaurant/bar though. Waiters were rude, brought the wrong items and it took over an hour to bring us some salads. I have to say that the food (when it arrives) is very good though. I asked for an umbrella over our table as it was really sunny, and they said ""just a minute"" to me three times over 30 minutes. In the end I got up and started doing it myself and then reluctantly they started moving one over. In the meantime though we'd all gotten sunburnt! Not ideal and not what you expect in a good hotel. I think this issue with the waiters outside seriously needs addressing by the management. It was as if they just didn't want to be there and certainly trying to get anyone to take your order is a challenge! ",4,2016,06,03
28,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This is the 2nd time we stayed in the Grand Hotel La Florida and the second time was even better than the first. We would like to express our thanks to all the staff who make the stay that much better. Laura in particular was outstanding and made us feel like we were in a home away from. It's off the beaten track and may not be for everyone but if you want high quality and breathless views this is the place. Highly recommended... 
Mr and Mrs Miller ",5,2016,05,25
28,Quite frankly I am appalled!,"We popped into the hotel to admire the view after friends had stayed with you . We decided to have a drink in the terrace bar. Service was very slow, even although the bar wasn't very busy, we ordered a beer & a white wine spritzer with soda. What came was white wine with tonic. I took one taste then went to the bar. 3 staff were around the bar and ignored me standing there, my husband managed to attract our waitress as she went past. Eventually my drink was changed, the barman poured on tap soda into a glass then decided it was too much so I ended up with around 4cm in the bottom of my glass before they added the wine. All this took around 30 mins to get my drink. To add insult to injury I was charged 5 euros on top of my 6 euro wine. Having stayed in many 5star hotels , I expect to pay a premium on drinks & also have premium service but it was so terrible , it was embarrassing.",1,2016,05,22
28,Nothing short of amazing!,"Me and my wife stayed here for the second half of our Honeymoon after spending 2 nights at a hotel in the centre of Barcelona, we planned to spend the last 3 nights up in the hills for a more relaxed end to our break. I couldn't fault any part of this hotel, views were amazing from anywhere in the hotel looking across the whole city. Staff were fantastic and always there to help. Food was great too and the free shuttle bus to and from the centre of Barcelona with a very helpful concierge was a great thing to have! ",5,2016,05,18
28,Amazing location & beautiful hotel!,"It is located in an absolutely amazing location! 5 out of 5! You can't beat the view! ( we had a city/sea view from our room). It's obviously a bit distant from the city centre but we hired a car and that solved the problem (please note there is very little parking spaces in front of the hotel so this was a bit problematic..).

Rooms are very elegant and spacious with a walk in shower and amazing L'occitane skincare products provided in the room.

The downside was the pool and the jacuzzi with quite cold water so we used it only once.

The other thing to mention is the food..Continental breakfast selection was great (tasty pastry, loads of fruits, cheese, yoghurts, delicious orange juice). Unfortunately my husband ordered English breakfast and surprisingly the hotel was short of many products (rashers, bacon, black pudding) so he ended having only one fried egg and one fried tomato on his plate:D The staff was very nice though and apologised for the issue caused by a small number of guests in the hotel and therefore they didn't stock this type of food as it wouldn't make any sense to buy only a couple of sausages:D (sic!)

Both dinners we had at Cafe 1925 and all I can say is..that we were hungry afterwards:) 

Overall however I can highly recommend the place!",5,2016,05,17
28,Classic 20's Charm,"The best view of Barcelona from the city facing rooms. Beautiful spacious bathroom, good service but if you eat here expect to pay a lot for food. Valet parking, spa etc is very nice also. To wake up with that view makes this hotel.",4,2016,05,11
28,"Beatiful view, average food","Barcelona is known to me for the excellent food, but here it was maximum average. Toilets were under repair the full day, our conference room was in the basement, no windows. The shower handle felt off, the wind was blowing through the closed windows and the fitness room a joke. Imagine you use the treadmill and you see yourself in one of this mirrors which make you half your size but double your weight... if this should increase motivation it did not work....",3,2016,05,09
28,Beautiful ,"This hotel and the service /customer care is absolutely superb. A relaxing, beautifully decorated , heavenly scented environment with the most attentive and friendly staff I have ever experienced . Carla, Laura and especially Mariano were exceptional. My dream is to come back here one day with my husband or family . I stayed for 3 nights with my sister at this gorgeous place. I can not fault it . For those who choose serenity over the hustle and bustle of the city this is a good place . Getting to town was not too hard as there is a free shuttle, although this has to be booked in advance. The pool and views were fantastic.  The only thing I could suggest is that it's time for the towels and robes to be upgraded. Five star boutique. ",5,2016,05,07
28,Great weekend visit with kids,"We visited for a weekend trip with two boys (aged 7 and 9).  

Overall, all staff were very friendly and we had no issues with requests we made at any time.  

The rooms (joining on the 3rd floor) were a good size and in excellent condition.  We had an issue with a shower unit that was repaired immediately when they were notified. 

The pool, indoor and out, were great, although the sauna and gym a little limited and under refurbishment in one case.  

The menu at the cafe was a little limited, but the food was great quality and the staff very helpful when catering to the children.  

This is a hotel for enjoying in good weather, sitting outdoors at the bar by the pool, or on the balcony of the room, or indoors with the sun streaming in through the large windows.  Enjoy the views of Barcelona, go into the city to see the sights, and then come back to relax.  

This might not be a Four Seasons, but it is a great hotel outside of and looking over a great city.",5,2016,05,07
28,Great Stay,"Extremely friendly staff. Great Location. Great Breakfast. Very Nice Spa facilities. Calm and Relaxed Environment, Fantastic View :) Room decoration and all amenities were superb. We had been upgraded to a suite which was a nice gesture from the management. Patricia from reservations, Laura from front desk were very plesant to deal with. All in all was an extremely plesant stay. Thank you all for making our stay for such memorable one. Will definitely come back :)",5,2016,05,03
28,Absolutely wonderful !,"This hotel is lovely!! It's beautiful with some truly breathtaking views! The staff are all so friendly and helpful.

Our room was amazing! It was humongous ! With a great balcony looking over Barcelona and a hot tub. The bathroom was lovely, with lots of towels and toiletries . The bath is big enough to fit 5 people in and you could fit ten in the huge shower!

The gym is mainly just CV equipment if you like to work out. The pool area is beautiful! The pool had only just been filled up so was a bit too cold on the first day, but had warmed up enough by the second day.

Breakfast was probably my most favourite thing about this hotel. It's an all you can eat buffet whilst looking over the city of Barcelona. There's every type of food you can thing of! From meats, cheeses, yogurts, fruit, bacon, sausage, cereals, cakes and fruit juices and smoothies. I really enjoyed the cava you can have with breakfast.

The only slight bit of criticism I could give was that I'd pre ordered some champagne and strawberries on arrival as it was our anniversary . When we arrived there wasn't any champagne and strawberries........but instead a full chocolate cake wishing me a happy birthday ! It lead to good comical value of nothing else. The hotel had a lot of people these celebrating their birthday and weddings etc. I can see how they may have become confused.

One of the things that stood out to me and my partner was how amazing the hotel smelt! And you can actually buy their air freshener spritz .......so we did!! And I'll have to go back and get some more!

",5,2016,05,03
28,What a view...,"Unique situation, out of town, a bit far from the city so you must have car if you want to visit the city while staying there. However, I will recommand it for a relaxing and easy-going quick gateway. Not for hardcore tourists who want to get the most out of Barcelona city. Very long way from downtown, and quite dangerous road at night. But when you get there, what a treat! Very nice and hepful staff, beautiful room (suite with city views) and cool pool area. Food is very good also.",5,2016,04,30
28,Could be amazing but has issues,"We stayed one nigh before a cruise and my daughter was struck in the face with a massive glass door that is defective. We took care of her and were taken to an amazing room with amazing views which inspired us to book another night after our cruise. We had adjoining rooms and one smelt very moldy. 

We checked in after the cruise and were able to use the facilities (patio area smells like mold too) until our room was ready (cruises have you disembark so early). The room still was not ready in the afternoon so we went to Tibidabo park next door to waste some time. Returned at 6:00 pm and the room was ready but we still waited 45 minutes to find out they had no keys for it (seriously). The prior occupants took the keys and they had no others. They opened the door for us and said if we left the room at all that we could call them to be let back in. 

Still another nice room with amazing views. My daughter left a precious baby blanket that she can't sleep without and it was never found (other guests in lobby complained of unfounded items as well). 

Great spa, hotel, etc but they need to address the mold and maybe offer an apology or complimentary item/service for the inconveniences that come with staying there. 

",4,2016,04,25
28,"A few problems, but lovely location","We have just spent 4 days at this lovely hotel.  Great views over the city and the sea.  At arrival we were given an upgraded room (two windows).  The bed itself is the most comfortable I have ever slept in.

A few problems - firstly, the air conditioning was stuck at 24 degrees and needed fixing.  This was done promptly.  Then the toilet wouldn't flush couple of days later, and gain that was fixed quickly.

The food is extremely good, large variety for breakfast and the evening menu wide enough to cater for most people.  All very attentive staff and very friendly.

Lots of seating areas outside so that you do not feel cramped together.  And seating area in the lounge comfortable.  A lovely scent is all around which is calming and fresh.

However, there is and was work being done at the hotel.  The swimming pool was not available for almost 2 of our 4 days there.  The sauna was turned off, the steam rooms not working.  Gym equipment out of order, hazard tape around a lot of the outside where new decking is being layed, new planting etc.

The last straw was our final night.  We found out there was a wedding reception being held, and we had no-where to eat dinner.  The restaurant was full, and we were only offered room service, or we could get a taxi into the centre to eat.  

I wish we had been told about this, only right that you inform your guests of this.  We could have then made arrangements.  But to not look after your hotel residents is not acceptable.  

This could be the most fab hotel, and a great experience.  Could be that we were there when teething problems, but I do think more attention to the hotel guests is needed as a matter of courtesy.

I would stay again, but would be prepared for these type of small issues.",4,2016,04,25
28,"If you want a lovely, romantic retreat, book here for the views alone as they're breathtaking.","I am so very pleased that I decided on booking this hotel for my partners birthday surprise. We have both never been to Barcelona before and the only thing that was holding me back was that it was up on the mountain, quite far from the city centre (so the cost of taxi fares would add up). The views are magnificent, absolutely beautiful. 

We arrived at 12pm (check-in was at 3pm), we sat and had a drink and were told we would be advised when the room was ready. I was a little disappointed to only be called at 2:45pm to get into our room, especially as I had emailed weeks previously to ask about an early check-in. Most places I have been to have always accommodated an early check-in. When we arrived to the room, there was a group of people just leaving, as if they were having a private tour - doesn't look the best when we are paying guests awaiting to enter. Itor (apologies for the spelling) said we could have 2 free cocktails at the bar for the inconvenience (we had to ask 3 times for these to be removed from our bill).

I would recommend getting a room with a city/sea facing view. We were on level 4, room 402. This is a corner room with 2 separate balconies, one with a table and chairs. We could watch the sun rise in the morning from the city/sea view and we could see it setting from the other balcony. The junior suite was lovely, I was hoping we would be upgraded but no such luck. The bathroom was huge, a lobby, a seating area with window, sofas, table, chairs and desk, then the bedroom which could be separated with doors. There is a mini bar in the room. The only slight downfall was that the bed should have been facing out to the beautiful view of the sea/city but I understand that was not the layout of the room. When we returned after dinner on the first night, a welcome piece of cake was left for us to share. Also, bottled water was delivered every night. The bed was very comfy. 

The staff were all very pleasant, no complaints. We had breakfast 1 of the mornings, it is 23 euros each if booked in advance. There are many things to choose from so it is worth the money. The shuttle bus which the hotel provides is in fact a SIX seater taxi. The only other downfall is this due to it's location. We must have spent a small fortune on taxis daily. My plan was to travel down and back from the city in the shuttle but this was always full. We got it one day at noon, all 10am slots were busy. Booking in advance is a must, I thought we would be ok to book on arrival but perhaps I should have booked the shuttle as soon as I booked the hotel (2 months in advance?!). Anyway, I was aware of this. A taxi from the airport was 35 euros, but returning to the airport was 45 euros. Perhaps you should consider a transfer service. Taxis into the city centre were around 30-35 euros but returning was always cheaper, around 20-30 euros. 

This does not detract from the beautiful views from the hotel. I loved our trip to Barcelona and my boyfriend was very happy.

Thank you to Hotel La Florida for a memorable stay.",5,2016,04,25
28,Great for families,Enjoyed this friendly and convenient resort.  The driver initially brought us to the wrong hotel! However this was soon rectified and we enjoyed the villa with private pool.  The restaurants we all good and there is nice variety for something new every night.  I would return.,5,2016,04,25
28,So stunning I can't think of any other title,"So beautiful, warm, welcoming and gorgeous I don't know how I can do this place justice. From the smiling beautiful reception staff (Thankyou Guillaume) to the uber efficient and conversational bar staff (Thankyou Rogere) to the very beautiful and silly room service (Thankyou Camille) the staff equally matched the idyllic surroundings and facilities. This place is so fabulous I wanted to give it no stars simply to keep it a secret so it's all mine next time I go. Quite simply I would never now consider going for a luxury weekend anywhere else. I suspect I would be disappointed :-) If any part of you is hesitating in booking a room here, don't. You won't stop smiling from the minute you arrive. And the breakfast @ €23? Totally worth it. Perfect for lovers and best friends. I came home a week ago and I am still smiling.",5,2016,04,23
28,One Star Off the Making.....,"This hotel would appear, at first glance, to have it all.  Historical building, beautifully renovated, breathtaking vistas all round, a pleasing decor, smells delicious,  but it needs to invest in more staff and better training.  The reception and doormen are on the ball - ace, but the bar staff may as well not be there.  They wander around ignoring their patrons, then making a hash of the charges.  Room service is slow and sloppy.  I've been in quite a few 5 star hotels across the planet and I've never had plates being balanced on dressing tables, fridge tops and bedside cabinets so you are left wandering about the room spraying crumbs and spilling coffee - what happened to the good old fashioned notion of a table or a trolley?  Thankfully, we were smart enough to give the restaurants a miss - I can't imagine there would have been improvements validating the ridiculous 45 euros for a main course!  Oh, and if you don't mind spending the equivalent of a first class plane ticket in taxi fares in and out of the city centre for a week, this is the place to be.......Shame really, it has potential, but get your act together La Florida.  Retrain your staff, up the numbers and have a permanent fleet of courtesy buses available for your guests.  That way, we might just leave starry eyed instead of throwing the rose coloured specs into the nearest scented waste bin!  Right now the best I can say is you aspire to be a 5 star hotel, but you're not quite there yet.",4,2016,04,21
28,Disappointing,"Save your money and book elsewhere. 
This hotel has so many maintenance issues and repairs that are just been overlooked. 
My boyfriend requested several things via email but none were acknowledged. 
The staff are miserable and don’t care about the guests, we even witnessed them aggressively arguing with a family in the reception area. The hotel is miles away from the city centre and costs us a fortune in a taxi every day because the shuttle was always full. The views are great but you can get them in a lot of places in Barcelona, don’t waste your money here.",1,2016,04,19
28," As Close to Heaven as You're Going to Get","Situated high atop a mountain, a stone's throw away from the old Cathedral of Barcelona, is the hidden gem, La Florida Hotel and Spa.  This property, seeped in wartime history, floats elegantly above the entirety of Barcelona, with jaw-dropping views from any of its rooms or suites.
Since it's a good 20 to 30 minute drive to the top, La Florida is not for the Barcelona first-timer because from here you get to admire this spectacularly unique city in it's entirety all at once.  Unless you've already seen everything Señor Gaudi had artfully constructed, this would probably not be your first choice of hotels, but if you crave a hideaway (much like Hitler's inner-circle did), this Leading Hotel of the World is attractively priced and well worth a week or a month of hideout time.",5,2016,04,17
28,Good hotel but one thing spoils it / hotel take note ,Excellent hotel with amazing views and a lovely tranquil atmosphere high above the city. Made very good indeed by the absolutely first class staff. The assessment of others that the staff are not friendly is not true. The staff do everything to help and can not do enough. There is one problem (I am staying here till april 20th) and that is there are lots of ugly works going on in the hotel grounds. Rubbish bags and unpleasant looking cordons. This ruins the overall atmosphere which on every other front is so good and the hotel need to sort this out especially given the price it is asking .,4,2016,04,16
28,Just awful,"Don't be fooled by a lot of fake reviews on here! I would assume that's the only reason where this hotel gets its higher ratings, a closer look at these reviews and it's obvious friends and staff of the hotel have wrote them, accounts set up and all reviews wrote on the same day. 

The hotel needs a full make over as the rooms are tired and dated. Bedding was stained and the whole floor was covered in scratches. The rooms offer great views but that's were the pros of this hotel stop unfortunately. 

Me and my partner called prior to arriving to book the shuttle bus but was told we can't and it's only available to guests that are already in the hotel. Strange as the hotel responded on here to an unhappy customer who had to pay for taxis everyday to the city centre and said they should have called to book. We ended up having to pay everyday to get into town and back. 

We asked the staff about places to visit etc but they couldn't be bothered to assist us and told us to go to tourist info in town. The restaurant service was incredibly slow and food is extremely overpriced along with the drinks in the bar. 

We weren't expecting great service as several emails we had sent had been ignored prior to arriving, however we didn't expect it to be so bad! Requests weren't fulfilled, lazy staff and poor rooms. 

We definitely won't be returning!

28,Fantasic Hotel,"I have nothing but praise for this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was lovely. The bed was very comfortable, everything was very clean and cared for and the views across Barcelona were breath taking. It was wonderful to have a swim in the pool or relax in the Jacuzzi  after a days sight seeing.
As mentioned in other reviews the shuttle bus is really a car that seats 6 and is quickly booked. We managed to reserve seats for the return trips from the city, but had to make our own way in every morning. It was very easy to do. You catch the 111 bus from the bus stop across the road from the hotel, get off at the Funicular station, take the funicular down the hill to the metro station and then get the metro into the city centre. It sounds complicated and time consuming, but in actual fact it isn’t. All the modes of transport used ran frequently and efficiently. 
I would definitely return to this hotel. It may not be as convenient as staying in the centre of the city, but the beautiful views more than make up for it.",5,2016,04,09
28,Don't risk itt,"If you are considering an alternative hotel then certainly book that one instead.   Undoubtedly this Hotel enjoys a unique location but has the ambience of an isolated, expensive retirement home.  Inconsistent service from uncaring (sometimes rude) staff secures this Hotel it's place on the ""ones to avoid"" list.",1,2016,04,07
28,"great location, impeccable service","impecable service. It's a wonderful hotel, perfect for a relaxing stay in the city. The location is certainly unique. highly recommended. the natural park of Collserola is ideal for hiking and jogging.",5,2016,04,06
28,Arrived at 11:45pm. Overbooked and kicked out. Staff extremely rude,"Arrived at 11:45pm. Had two rooms booked with the hotel and after sending 2 emails to confirm room requirements would be fulfilled we called the hotel the day before leaving too and was assured all was in hand. As you can imagine after going to these lengths it was a special occasion and we wanted to ensure everything ran smoothly. 

After paying €40 in a taxi to the top of the mountain we arrived to be told there was no room and we'd have to go stop somewhere else. To specify, the hotel didn't actually double book, but we were told a larger group of people wanted to stay at the hotel so our booking was disregarded as there was more money to be had. It was approaching 12pm, the kids were crying and the only option provided was a sub standard hotel elsewhere. We asked why we were not told prior to arriving and their response was 'we didn't think it was worth it' and staff confessed to knowing there was no room for us early morning (or even the day before) but chose not to tell us until we arrived. 

No words can describe how vile the staff's behaviour was. There was no manager present and no female staff, just 3 men who tried intimidating 2 women and 2 young girls. I'm sure the situation would not be the same if a man was travelling with us. The hotel's form of compensation was that they would pay for our taxi to the alternative hotel (The Miramar, hardly the same)

After several hours of refusing to accept this 'unique solution' the men started threatening us and demanded we leave. It was absolutely shambolic and not once did we receive a sincere apology. The time was approaching 4:00am and the staff were extremely frustrated we were still in the hotel (one was told to sit in the back room to calm down after looking like he was going to physically assault us.) It appeared the situation was escalating and they were aware we were only going to leave if we be moved to a hotel of our choice if available. 

Finally an alternative option was presented and at 4:30am we arrived at hotel W. It was absolutely incredible and couldn't have worked out better!! The staff couldn't do enough to help and treatment made it worlds apart from the nightmare on the hill. Worst treatment we have ever received.",1,2016,04,05
28,Stunning,It is a stunning hotel. The rooms are huge and so beautiful and the service is impeccable! Love the indoor pool. The hotel has a really relaxing atmosphere perfect for those looking for peace and quiet time just outside of the city. Awesome view of the city.,5,2016,04,04
28,"Dirty rooms, rude unhelpful staff, shuttle not running. Over all poor.","The rooms appear beautiful online but in reality it's a different story. They are dated, mouldy and lots of small repairs are needed. Not 5 star quality. Often the staff can make up for the accommodation been disappointing but not here. They are rude, unhelpful and disinterested. The man on the bar was the only member of staff that made an effort. The hotel was incredibly noisy in the evening and with the location been on top of a mountain top you're not able to leave unless you want to pay €80 to go into the city and back. The shuttle was full, they say there is a shuttle service however it does not say it can only accommodate 6 people at a time. We arrived and this was already overbooked. I would definitely recommend you stay closer to the city and somewhere where the staff have been trained in customer service.",1,2016,04,03
28,Magnífico!,"Had a lovely stay with the family (with 3 young children) and in-laws last week. Absolutely charming place with a cozy, calm and serene atmosphere and smashing scenery. A very special mention to Lucas for taking the time to sit down with us to go through an itinerary for the rest of our stay, including making suggestions for restaurants serving authentic Catalan cuisine (not the usual tourist traps mind you). Lucas even went an extra step to personally make reservations for us. Overall, a wonderful, magnificent stay. Gracias, team Hotel La Florida!",4,2016,04,01
28,Romantic hotel with great views ,"I have just arrived back from a 3 night stay in Barcelona and it’s definitely one of my favourite holidays I have ever had. Yes, Barcelona is simply incredible, but Gran Hotel La Florida also played a massive part in making our stay fantastic from beginning to end!
Firstly, our room was fantastic!! We had a junior suite (502) with a small balcony, sitting area and huge bathroom. The views across the city, and over the mountain and sea was something I will never forget. The pool area was lovely, and the hot tub was a great place to relax after a long day sight-seeing. The pool is open until 10pm so perfect for an evening swim, you can also swim in the outdoor heated pool which is beautiful, especially when the sun is setting over the sea, but only if you don’t mind those eating dinner in the restaurant watching you, luckily that didn’t bother me ha ha! We didn’t get a chance to enjoy the large outdoor seating area as the weather wasn’t warm enough, but I would love to return in the summer to make the most of the comfy outdoor chairs and pool.
 
The only bit of constructive criticism, which I really do think would improve the hotel is the shuttle service. We did manage to book on the shuttle most of the time during our stay, but I can imagine in the summer months this would be a little harder. Perhaps the hotel should consider having more than 1 shuttle bus? And perhaps run the shuttle service in the evenings, perhaps one bus at 18:00 and one bus at 21:00? For those guests who would like to enjoy the nightlife in centre. We had to get a taxi back a couple of times in the evening, once rather late at night (23:00) which caused a bit of trouble as the first taxi refused to take us up the mountain… luckily we managed to track a taxi down who was willing to drive us to the hotel, although he charged us 40EUR and the poor guy didn’t actually know where the hotel was…!
However, this was the only issue we had with regards to travel and I wouldn’t let this put you off staying as it’s great (in my opinion) to be tucked away on the mountain after a long day in the hustle and bustle of the city.
 
The hotel is also a really short walk to the Tibidabo fun fair, and Temple of the Scared Heart of Jesus. It’s definitely worth a walk up there and apparently you can catch a lift to the top of the temple and look out over the city. We would have done this but on our last day the fog was so thick it was pointless!
 
The concierge were so lovely, all staff members were so helpful and kind. Lucas was a real help and Wolfgang in Café 1925 was a lovely waiter.
 
Thanks for making our stay so special, I would love to return!

28,"Romance, Bubbles, Fresh Peach Juice and Breath-taking Scenery","I have just joined trip advisor and have a backlog of reviews to write, I thought my first review must be of a hotel that elicits such fond memories. My partner and I stayed at the hotel May 2014 and we still rave about the hotel to this day, perhaps one of the best hotels that we have stayed in. On arrival we were greeted by friendly and professional staff who presented us with a warm welcome and a glass of Cava. 
The breakfast that the hotel provides is superb, the fresh peach juice (many other fresh juices available too) was delicious, there was a variety of buffet breakfast components available that changed from day to day and the scrambled egg was light, fluffy, fresh and creamy, very difficult to beat. I am a vegetarian and the chef was very accommodating and said that anything I request he could ensure that I was happy. If you fancy a special treat at breakfast, Cava was on offer, giving that extra special feel. One other thing that made breakfast romantic was the beautiful scenery comprising of incredible views of Barcelona, greenery and an infinity pool. 

The rooms were very luxurious, comfy super king size bed, full length arched windows that framed the view beautifully and very spacious bathrooms with a very grand feel. 

All of the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and the hotel was very well maintained. The hotel fully deserves its 5 stars. If you want a romantic experience at the top of a mountain in Barcelona, then this is the hotel for you.",5,2016,03,21
28,It would have been Five Stars... but...,"What an amazing hotel in an amazing location.  Our greeting was exceptional with Carla, who poured us a glass of Cava on arrival.

The room was spacious and airy with two balconies and breathtaking views over Barcelona.

Spa facilities were also excellent and clean.

The room service we received on the first night was excellently presented, very tasty and the service was brilliant.

There is an amazing Theme Park a few meters up the road which has excellent rides for adults and children alike – it really is a great day out.  There is also the most beautiful church next to the park, which is well worth a visit too.

The hotel and location is second to none and for the above reasons, I would return.

Where it was badly let down was:

•	€300 is required on arrival for any extras which you may have – we were not aware of this so were immediately €300 down
•	We got stranded in Vall Hebron 10 kilometres away and could not access a taxi (this was around 10pm).  We called the hotel to ask them if they could assist us with a taxi, either a number or put us through to a taxi firm, or send us one – we were told to download an app…. We had no internet signal.  We had to go to the nearest hospital to get access to a taxi.  This was totally unacceptable on the part of the hotel, this should never happen and be noted by management for future reference!  
•	It took several hours to have an iron brought to our room.  We had to ask on four separate occasions 
•	Early check out breakfast consists of a smoked salmon sandwich with breads and fruit, juice, coffee etc – I am allergic to fish so asked front desk reception for another sandwich but was given a shrug of the shoulders and told the kitchen was closed and there were no alternatives.  They should check dietary requirements before ordering and not assume!  
•	No bottle of cava in room on arrival like other guests received (not sure if this is because we were upgraded)

Had it not been for the above negatives, they would certainly have gotten five stars!",3,2016,03,17
28,"Great hotel, great service, but a bit far from the city centre","Great hotel. The facilities and the service are top! The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. We visit Barcelona often but had never stayed here before. It felt like having a small vacation within a vacation.
If you are looking for a top quality place, calm and with the best view of Barcelona, I highly recommend it.",4,2016,03,11
28,Lovely spa with a lovely view,"We went here as a group of friends to visit the spa. It was great. Good facilities and the massage was good too! Very relaxing! Definitely recommend! Only thing was when we went the jacuzzi was pumping cold bubbles which wasn't great! Overall we really enjoyed! 
",4,2016,03,08
28,Terrific,"Excellent location, with phenomenal views.  Service was good, but not excellent.  Staff were friendly.

We had an executive suite, which was spacious, well appointed and beautifully fitted.  And in particular the bed was very comfortable.",5,2016,03,05
28,Wahoo just great!,"I have to admit this is a must as hotel. Amazing view on the city go there to have diner or for a dink it is really worth it!
I had to wait long for a dinner that's why I don't put 5 star in my review but overall great experience I will be back.
Carla at the reception was really professional and friendly well done!",4,2016,02,18
28,what a great spot to have a hotel!,"Lovely hotel in a 90yr old building on top of the mountain Tibidabo. Rooms are clean and well maintained and have a spacious bathroom and bed. Good isolation, did not hear the other guests walk or talk. Views are absolutely wonderful, no matter where you are located in the hotel. One morning it was so bright outside, we could see the Pyrenees from our room! Staff is most friendly and helpful, cleaning staff did a great job as well.
Great spa to relax after a day sightseeing in the city. 
Only downside were the very expensive prices for drinks and food. Even a simple small Coke or coffee was already 6,-.",5,2016,02,10
28,"Mouldy rooms, no working aircon","This was a terrible stay. The location is beautiful and at first glance the hotel is beautiful. However, the room and my colleagues rooms too had serious mould issues. I have never seen anything quite as bad! The mould was so bad it was giving me breathing issues, bathroom especially was just disgusting because of this. The aircon was not working on cool because they said it's not summer so they stop cold air and only have heating, despite it being probably 27 celsius inside the room. Hotter than outside. They told me to have the windows open because it's not summer so there are no mosquitos as bugs don't care about the date but the weather, in fact mosquitos were flying in! Ridiculous for a 5 star hotel. So to manage with the heat and the mould  I had to choose to get bitten instead. I would never stay there again. Only positive is that the view is great and they managed to organise taxi for early morning checkout. ",1,2016,02,08
28,Amazing Views and Spa,"A sea facing room gave fantastic views down over Barcelona. The Staff where all helpful and very friendly. The Spa treatments we had where amazing thank you.If you looking to pamper yourself in a quiet location with great views this is the place.
My only negative point would be how expensive the food and drinks are, compared to the prices down in Barcelona",4,2016,01,25
28,Stunning secret hideaway overlooking Barcelona,"Just got back from a fabulous long mid-winter weekend here. The weather was cold but the sun was out and we made the most of it using the loungers on the terrace of our room - what a view! The hotel itself I'd describe as slightly faded glamour, and some amenties like the main restaurant were closed (presumably because we visited in quiet season). But this was made up for by the charming helpful staff who couldn't do enough for us, and the more intimate and quiet feel of our stay.

I really enjoyed being a bit removed from the city but close enough to enjoy it when we felt like a bit of city buzz. We hired a car but ate out on two nights and just caught cabs - which I thought were reasonably priced at 20Euro one way. On one other night we ate at the hotel cafe - food was of a very good standard and again the staff were lovely.

On our final night there was a bit of a mix up with our booking and we were initially going to have to move, however their amazing management decided to upgrade us instead. So we had our final night in one of the suites, which was off the hook! A huge room overlooking the whole of Barcelona, a bath that enjoyed the same view and a corner terrace with a 270degree view of the city, the sea and back into the mountains behind. It felt like you were staying in a luxurious sea captain's lookout.

Would highly recommend this hotel as a romantic couples stay!",5,2016,01,21
28,Beautiful ,"Amazing location (obviously the main attraction), great views and beautiful hotel, but average pool/spa facilities, shuttle bus was never available and overpriced for basic food and drinks - as in things like soft drinks, sandwiches, etc. I expect to pay more for an evening meal or alcoholic drinks, but with no proper shops or restaurants nearby, I think it's very cheeky (or clever) to charge €25 for breakfast or €6 for a water. I would recommend it for the overall luxury mountain stay experience, but just expect to overpay for everything.
Also, Laura was the politest member of staff. Big thanks to her.",4,2016,01,11
28,"Great Service, Supreme Comfort, and Spectacular Views","This luxury mountain top hotel has breathtaking views of Barcelona City, especially at night with all the wonderful lights. The restaurant is situated so that you can enjoy the views from inside or out. There is also a stunning swimming pool and spa area, with a magnificent lap pool. L'occitane spa is also located on site. The taxi cost from the airport is 40-45 Euros in a metered taxi. And from the hotel down into the City Centre is between 20-25 Euros. Using friendly advice from the room service staff, and as an adventure, we caught the bus (No.111 and 2.15 Euro pp) from the front of the hotel to the Funicula stop and rode it down the mountain to the train that took us directly into the city (about 30-40mins). We paid 23 Euro for 3 people for an all day ticket) It was safe, fun and worked like clockwork!  We found the hotel staff very approachable and eager to assist in any way. We booked a larger 'family' room (No.203), which was very spacious for 3 people, and had magnificent views. We also stayed for the new year celebrations at the hotel which included a set menu dinner with matching wines, a gift, view of the Barcelona fireworks, and dancing in the onsite nightclub with DJ.  
The breakfast buffet is recommended too. The only small downside for me is that, like many other european hotels, there is no iron in the room.
All in all, a wonderfully relaxing and luxurious experience, in a scenic location that is still within a reasonable distance to enjoy all the usual city highlights of Barcelona.",5,2016,01,09
28,Breathtaking View but poor service,"The hotel's location is fantastic, very quite, relaxing and wonderful city views. however, the service we received was not up to standard and could be improved to maintain the reputation of your business. There was no kettle nor coffee/ tea tray in the room as you would expect to see in any five star hotel! we informed the reception that we need coffee in the morning and they promised us they will send us to the room every morning. in the first day they kept the promise and they replaced a tray with only tea bags on it!! next morning we received 1 cup only and the third day we received 2 cups that were less that half full!!

On our first day we went to reception and informed them that t is out first time in Barcelona and we need to know the transportation options to the city and back. they told us that there is only 1 bus and keeps running until 9pm. when we were ready to get back to the hotel we waited for 40 minutes and the bus never showedd up! on the second day the bus driver informed us that the last bus was at 5pm so we had to take taxis to hotel for both days and it cost us a fortune. such small concierge knowledge could save us a lot of trouble and money but unfortunately you did not communicate with us enough! no maps were given and no city recommendations or any sort of information from your side!!

No international adaptors were available no face towels in the room/ and when we made a booking at your restaurant we were seated in a huge round table next to each other which it was not what we asked for!

La florida is a good place but the people need more training.",3,2016,01,07
28,"A sublime experience at the top of the mountain, the city and the Mediterranean below","This is a must for anyone who is into luxury travel, panoramic vistas and utmost comfort, away from the maddening crowds. La Florida is a former monastery a later a Civil War hospital turned into a modern, five start hotel having preserved the historic outer character. It is high above Barcelona and the sweeping views from most room - some times the clouds actually envelope the hotel giving you a truly celestial experience. Every confort can be found in the rooms, which are spacious and most have outer private terraces. The bathrooms are fit for a queen. At outside bar, pool are charming and complement the property well. The pool actually ducks inside into an indoor state of the art spa, fit for royalty 12 months of the year. The menu is excellent if not ample, but certainly first class. The service in the restaurant is slow,, room service is efficient and five star. This is a hotel to make memories. It you are into doing the 36 hour Barcelona tour this is not for you. Or maybe you can do that and finish off here for a grand finale. 
My two days days there are memorable. I wish I could go back and maybe I will. My girlfriend was impressed beyond words.",5,2016,01,05
28,"Romantic, Quiet, Great view","I thought it was a very romantic hotel and the mountain top location made for spectacular views. I thought the staff was excellent. No complains. Since, we had our high school daughter with us in a suite so a downtown location might have been better for this particular trip.",5,2016,01,01
28,Stunning views over Barcelona,"About my fourth time here, situated high on a cliff overlooking Barcelona. Once, back in 2007, I got one of the top rooms with its own tower. Not this time, but this is a lovely old 'Gran Hotel' with black & white photos of the construction and the extraordinary amusement park alongside. Food good. Wifi worked. Can open the windows and stroll onto a balcony. Well known for its outstanding views over Barcelona.",4,2015,12,22
28,Beautiful Views,I booked a room with an ocean and received a mountain view. I was comped a suite for the error. The staff were very helpful and friendly. My wife used the spa facilities and was given and excellent massage and facial treatment. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The breakfast buffet had an excellent  selection of hot and cold items. The service throughout the hotel was 5 star +.,4,2015,12,14
28,Wonderful hotel!,"We came here as a romantic date.
We had a car so the distance from the city was not a problem, it was on the contrary and advantage. 
The view coming up was stunning, the view from the room was equally impressive and gives this hotel a big plus.
The service at the check in, during all of our room service requests, massages requests and during our check out was very polite, no more no less. 
The room service food was tasty too. It comes in a classy rolling table.
The room was very spacious, we had 2 little terraces which made the view easier to admire. 
The pool area (pool and jacuzzi) was very simple. 
The big terrace next to the pool looked great but since the cold weather was upon us we didn't enjoy it as much as we would have in the summer - the installations look great though! 
The spa was amazing - the personnel was very sweet and the massages were great!

The experience was very relaxing and romantic - we had a great time in the Florida hotel and the site and people working there had a lot to do with it - they definitely contributed to make this experience great.",5,2015,12,13

As soon as we can we will return, Just like to thank all the staff and management to many to name individually, Thank you.    ",5,2015,12,04
28,30°c in the room and windows not isolated (4 nights),"At our arrival the hotel is located on a nice hill overlooking Barcelona (25 min from city centre by car). Having two children under 3 we decided to book a junior suit so that we could separate the bedroom from the living room where our children would sleep as shown on the pictures from the hotel website and confirmed by phone directly with the hotel (remember to double confirm as one confirmation doesn't seem to be enough).

When we discovered the room, the temperature was 30°c but we were told that it was due to the sun on the windows. After trying to let fresh air in and turning all heating off nothing changed and unfortunately our complaints weren't heard and we had to sleep through the first night between the heat of the room and the cold outside since it is november and we needed to keep the windows open to keep at least 25°c in the room.

On the second night the heating problem was finally resolved but now that the windows were closed, we noticed that they did not close properly and again, despite our complaints only poor excuses were made about the weather and we had to sleep through a second night during which the windows slammed open twice waking up all the family. When we mentioned the problem, we were told that it was due to the wind!!! It was obvious but didn't change the fact that when you have windows it is to have them closed regardless of outdoor conditions! This was clearly a big lack of maintenance unforgivable for a 5 stars hotel.

After another round of complaints the hotel finally agreed to find a solution (or so we were told in the morning). At the end of the day when we returned we found out that nothing had been resolved so after a final desperate attempt we received a new room (which was a downgrade from our room!!!!).

On our final day, very much depressed, we received a final change of room to finish our trip in the proper junior suit we wanted in the first place. (after 3 changes, including one with the children sleeping!)

And of course after having only one proper night of sleep in the room we paid for, we are charged full price on all the nights!!!! Nice customer service regarding all the time wasted in complaints, a downgrade, and the struggle to obtain what should have always been. We also would like to point out the expensive breakfast specially since you have no choice but to eat there. You will be disappointed if you are used to real 5 stars hotel's buffet. And remember to ask for eggs or other warm dishes since it is not clearly mentioned that they exist. 

Despite all this problems, specially regarding the rooms and the follow up on our issues, the spa area was very nice for children. The hotel has a beautiful view but remember to book the shuttle to the city centre straight from arrival which are very handy but sadly return early (16:30). There is also an amusement park next door. 

We also would like to add that despite the lack of action from the management team, most of the staff was very kind and understanding (which is nice but not very helpful when nothing is done about it and nobody takes you seriously).",2,2015,11,24
28,Amazing hotel with even better views!,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in within Europe. Rooms were fantastic and staff all very attentive and helpful. Spa was basic but very nice and the outside pool with the view over the city was amazing.

Main points however are the location for me. It is a short ride out of town, which free shuttles are provided for, but for this you get so much more. The setting and views from here are spectacular, especially at night sitting by the pool for a drink after coming back. 

I love staying in the city and would prefer that normally but for a change this was great and would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,11,20
28,"Amazing views, lovely staff","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights earlier this year. The hotel has wonderful views of Barcelona from the outdoor terrace and dining room. Breakfast on the terrace is fantastic. 

The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The manager of the restaurant was very helpful and welcoming. Eating dinner by the windows in the evening overlooking Barcelona by night is lovely.

The room had great views and a good sized terrace. The bed was comfortable, you couldn't hear other guests once in your room.

The distance from the centre of Barcelona was not a major issue as there is a bus that you can catch. Overall a very relaxing and enjoyable stay in a great hotel.",4,2015,11,15
28,Détails country!,"Son Nice view... A location that gives you some calm. But details can be annoying. For example: a smell like an old perfume, not really fresh. Temperature: 27.7 degrees C. The shower is ok until you want to stop the flow: the handle stays in your hand. It still works when you put it back in the wall but it should be fixed...
Besides that, the hotel is nice and the people are smiling, what can be appreciated because I notice that it's not the case everywhere.",4,2015,11,10
28,"Great hotel, very relaxing, spectacular view","What a beautiful hotel!  We stayed in an executive suite facing the ocean with a huge balcony which was the only room available as we had to check-in the hotel without reservation (abruptly had checked out of a hotel we had reserved, Melia Sky Hotel, which is a dump) and had to move hotels quickly.  You can read my review of that hotel as well...

So, without much knowledge other than trip advisor reviews, here we were at the top of a mountain and what a lovely surprise.  We loved our entire stay at the hotel, everything from the nice spacious rooms (and fabulous bathrooms!) to the delicious room service and brunch.  The friendly staff were also helpful in getting us acquainted with the city and finding things to do.

The kids loved the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi which is open until late at night and I enjoyed having a cigar on the lovely balcony overlooking the entire city (what a view!).

We had rented a car so it wasn't a problem for us, but I would suspect that others might be turned off since this hotel is high in the mountain (about 10-15 minute drive from the city).  So, if you're looking to relax and get away from it all this is a good place to stay.  But if you're looking for daily activities or being able to explore on foot, I would suggest a different hotel downtown.  The Majestic and W Hotels were both nice.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for family's or couples that need to get away from the city hustle and bustle and looking for top notch quality and service. 

And to the staff, bravo, you did a stellar job and completely turned around a trip that was otherwise going to be doomed due to a poor hotel choice that we had made before.",5,2015,11,08
28,Breathtaking getaway from the city!,"My partner booked this as a birthday surprise on our last night of travelling around Europe. After two nights in the city, it was lovely to escape the hustle and bustle and just relax. The staff were very helpful and go out of their way to help you.

Our terrace room was simply stunning, extremely spacious with decadent interiors, huge windows overlooking the city and a plush bed that was enormous! The marble bathroom was about the size of my own bedroom at home, with a double bathtub for romantic moments and a separate marble wetroom and toilet. The views from the windows alone were spectacular, yet step out onto the city view balcony and take it all in. We had a (surprise!) hot tub on the terrace as well as sun loungers and table/chairs should we choose to dine there. If we had longer i could have easily enjoyed bathing in the sun from our terrace, but the outdoor pool is far too enticing! Staff were very helpful and filled our hot tub during our evening meal, so it was ready to go when we finished eating. Plenty of wardrobe space, snacks and beverages in the mini-bar as well as every toiletry you could need.

After checking in we headed straight back down to make the most of the 30 degree heat from the sun loungers and pods around the pool. The outdoor pool is heated, although not hot in October, it was a refreshing cool down from the sun. The bar terrace provides everything you need from drinks to snacks to a three course meal. The outdoor terrace goes down along the mountain with plenty of private spots to sit and enjoy the view. We were able to see the island of Menorca one day, as well as the cruise liners docking into the harbour. Highly recommend getting up early and catching the sunrise if it's a clear sky, the views are out of this world.

There are multiple restaurants in the hotel. We stuck to the ""bar"" menu as our last night didn't leave us flush for cash. However, the options on there were plentiful for two 25 year olds, and still extremely delicious. Breakfast in the morning was one to remember with everything you could dream of (cake, fruit pots, salmon, cured meats, pastries, hot options, fresh juices, champagne). 

I've seen other reviews that have mentioned the location being ""too far from the city"" but for us that is just what we wanted and is the unique advantage to the hotel. Yes, you may find other 5* hotels in the city centre, but none would compare to what Gran La Florida offer.",5,2015,10,31
28,Excellent Place to Stay,"Stayed 2 nights before leaving on a TransAtlantic cruise.  

Having stayed in town our last 5 visits, we decided to forego the hustle and bustle and found this hotel online.  Reviews were mixed but overall positive.  We can't rave enough about the hotel and staff.  If you want excitement and the go-go-go atmosphere-this isn't the place-go to the W.  If you want quality, comfort and to be treated as if you were the only guest-try La Florida.

Our suite was immense!  We had mountain and downtown views.  Simply beautiful  Expansive terrace to enjoy our morning coffee or evening drinks.  Huge marble bath too.  Great linens.  Hardwood floors and plaster moldings made this room unique.  This hotel room is not the typical, small hotel room found in many parts of Europe.

The restaurant is good, pricey, but good.  But the other option is to go into town, eat and come back out to the mountainside.  So, factoring in the cost of a taxi-prices were just fine.  And like all others have said-include the breakfast in your rate.  Food and selection very good.

Only negative I would say is so minor...bring your electrical adaptor as the hotel did not have one for us.  HOWEVER, they were extremely kind enough to charge our phones using the cable connecting to their PCs.

We live very well at home and expect the same when we travel.  La Florida gave us that.  We will definitely stay here again.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,10,29
28,Very nice resort property,"We booked 3 nights here to spend after being in downtown Barcelona for 5 nights. We were looking to just chill out high over the city after being on the go for the week. Be aware it is a long way from the city, high on the mtn overlook Barcleona and unless you have a vehicle, the only practical transportation is a cab. The cab rides we took ranged from 20 Euros to 40 Euros one way depending on the traffic and where you start in the city. The evening we arrived for our checkin we were pretty tired after tramping all over the city all day. It took 30 mins in the cab to arrive.When we got there, we were greeted by the Asst Manager who ""wanted to speak with me in private"". Uh Oh, never a good sign. Seems even though we had booked and paid 2 months earlier, they didn't have a room for us, they were overbooked for that night. 

Obviously we weren't happy, but they came up with decent resolution for the issue. We were booked for the evening in a comparable boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter. They would pay for breakfast there, the cab back to the city, the cab back here at our leisure, and also comp us to a dinner in their restaurant. It turned out to be okay. The new hotel was very nice and centrally located. We had been planning to take a cab to the city to visit the Picasso Museum anyway, and our new hotel was walking distance away. These things happen, and while I would have rather spent the evening at the Gran, the compromise was fine. They did a good job in the situation.

When we finally did make it back to the Gran, the hotel was wonderful. Specious rooms. The bathroom area by itself was larger than my master bedroom back home, with a sink & tub area, walk in shower, and two toilet areas, one with toilet and bidet, and the other with a smart toilet.

The spa and pool areas were first rate. I particually enjoyed the sauna and hot tub. The pool is large and continues outside to the terrace area overlooking the city. The weather was a bit chilly when we were there, so we only sampled in the indoor pool which was heated. The pool is accessible for those with disabilities with steps and also a hydraulic seat lift in and out of the water.

All our meals - though pricey - were excellent. We had lunch outdoors on the terrace our last day and you can't beat the view. It proved to be an excellent choice to dial down and go into relax mode before return home. The staff, location and facilities were great.

Oh yes, the wifi signal was strong all over the property which wasn't true at the other 2 hotels we stayed at. I dinged the location 1 star because it is hard to get to, but once you're there, they get the star back, as I knew that when we booked.",5,2015,10,28
28,"Excellent hotel, nicely located","Excellent service, spacious well decorated rooms and good conferencing facilities. Nice terraces, outside pool and view over Barcelona city center. Also the restaurant and bar area are decorated with style.",5,2015,10,28
28,Excellent,"What a beautiful place.. We arrived for a three night stay. The hotel was fully booked and they asked us if just for the night would we mind staying at their sister Hotel in Barcelona.. They paid for transport there and return the next day.. They had up graded the room, fantastic view.. Meal on the house.. Could not do enough for us. Breakfast is fantastic.. The gym and sauna and pool are lovely and you can use when ever you want. The church behind the hotel is well worth the visit. Definitely will go back loved the place.",5,2015,10,22
28,A highlight - you have to stay here.,"We stayed here on our last night in Barcelona and it was definitely worth waiting for. Everything about the hotel - the location, staff, food & wine, appointments - was superb. Check in includes a tour of the hotel facilities - no wonder they are showing off, it's really beautiful.

5 minutes walk for the top of Tibidabo, where a magnificent church will welcome you and where the view becomes 360 degrees.

Food quality very good, rooms are big and made with good taste. Sleeping very, very, very good!
One of the fastest Wi-Fi I ever found in an hotel.",5,2015,10,16
28,Lovely hotel just outside of city,"I loved this hotel - quiet area, lovely building and setting, charming and attentive staff, great breakfasts.
Visitors should be aware that this is some distance from sights of Barcelona.  It is easy enough to get into town (free shuttle service through hotel/public transport/cab) however if you want to go out to dinner in the evening cabs back cost about 25 euros (or more if you get a dodgy one who takes an odd route and it came to more than 40). 
Went in late September and hotel was quite quiet so often had pool and gym to myself which was wonderful!
Breakfasts are great and we usually had lots to eat so could miss out lunch and just go out to dinner, either at hotel (food pretty good; did not eat in the fancy restaurant) or in town.",4,2015,10,14
28,Superb,"I stayed with my wife in the sky terrace room with an amazing view of Barcelona. Ive stayed in 5* hotels all over the world but this hotel is breath taking and in my opinion one of the best globally.

I wish to thank everyone at this hotel for the amazing few days.
Mr gizli",5,2015,10,12
28,Perfection,"We arrived here for a three day stay in early Oct.  The smell of the hotel is intoxicating.  That alone relaxes you.  Check in was very easy, and the staff let us check in a few hours early.  One of the staff, and I can't remember his name, showed us around the hotel to include the pool area and our room while we waited to check it.  Our room, which was a terrace room overlooking the pool and all of Barcelona.  I easy could of just stayed in the room for the three days.  The room itself was great.  The bed very comfortable.  The bathroom had everything you could want plus more.  The water zone was perfect to relax after a long day.  The headed indoor pool, steam sauna, and dry sauna all were better than expected.  We eat through room service on two different occasions, and enjoyed every bite.  Lucas, the concierge was amazing.  He helped and went so far beyond what was expected, it made my head spin.  You can tell he truly cares about your time at his hotel, which is increasingly rare.  His first impression really set the tone for great stay.  I wish I could buy him a beer.  The hotel's breakfast is as spot on as the rest of the hotel.  They have everything from fresh fruit, hot items, great juices and plenty of options for caffeine.  The location makes it difficult to get breakfast anywhere else, but you wouldn't want to if you knew how good it was.  Some complain about the distance from center city, but that's part of the appeal for La Florida.  They do have a shuttle which leaves every two hours in the morning and early afternoon.  We never had a cab ride that was over 20 minutes or over 25 euro.  Completely reasonable.  The quietness and the views more than make up for this.  If I am ever in the great city of Barcelona again, there is no don't I will rest my head at La Florida.",5,2015,10,12
28,Top class hotel for a romantic Getaway!,"Barcelona may be the setting for a romantic movie, but the truth is that it can be hard for romance to blossom amidst the blaring of taxis, jostling crowds and tourists. Gran Hotel La Florida is quiet, relaxing, filled with either old Barcelona charm or sleek, modern decor, absolutely breathtaking views and providing couples with ample opportunities for intimate relaxation.

We stayed on suite 605, a large room with a huge terrace and a Jacuzzi to enjoy the unique views of Barcelona. We also enjoyed the l'occitane spa for private treatment, and the quality was once again top notch.

The staff were always helpful, courteous and friendly. A special word to the concierge's desk Gregorio and guest relations Marta Duran, who were tireless in their efforts to help me preparing a surprise to my girlfriend.

A must...",5,2015,10,05
28,Restful week,"Just back from a week in this fabulous hotel, cannot fault anything, the staff are amazing, polite, helpful always have a smile on their face, the location is just idyllic, top of a mountain with views to die for. Jaxiver the concierge was a mine of information and tried to please always, an asset to any company. Will certainly go back again, the only constructive criticism is about the resaurant, staying their for a week found the menu could do with an overhaul but understand this is being dealt with, just a bit more choice would be great.",5,2015,10,02
28,Spectacular View,"Reserved a superior room with mountain, city and sea view and it was well worth it - at any time of day the views were beautiful. The staff were very welcoming, the room was great and it is a nice hotel overall. It is a very interesting journey into the center of Barcelona by public transport, taking a short bus ride to the fenicular which connects directly with the metro then about 5 stops to Placa Catalunya. A quicker and easier commute than we had anticipated.  The hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle, but boòk ahead because it gets full. It was good to get back to the peace and quiet of the hotel after a day in the city. The coffee shop dinner service was good but the fòod was average and expensive. Breakfast buffet very good.
Would return.",4,2015,09,30
28,Hotel worth skipping,"Pros: 
1. Beautiful property with amazing views. 
2. Hotel welcomed us with champagne and strawberry chocolates. 
3. Friendly staff. 
Cons:
1. We were given an upgrade to a room with an outdoor jacuzzi but the jacuzzi didn't worked. Wasn't really an upgrade. 
2. I tried to get an upgrade to a room with a city view. Staff at front desk told me I would have to pay 80 Euro for the upgrade but later increased the amount to 200 Euro. Major communication gaps between people working at the hotel.
3. Very far from the city. 
4. One of the bathroom sink kept clogging.",2,2015,09,28
28,Perfect de-stressing holiday,"Me and my partner spent 5 nights here in late September and it was perfect! The hotel itself was even better than the pictures, was greeted every time upon entering the hotel. Every member of staff knew our names and was polite and accommodating at all times. Eating dinner of an evening out on the terrace with a beautiful view is a highlight of mine and even when it was a bit chilly they were quick to offer blankets to guest. 

Rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels and linen. 

No complaints! Will defo be visiting again.",5,2015,09,28
28,"Stunning terrace, stunning L shaped pool, stunning prices to match, but noisy outside while funfair operational outside","Breathtaking views, fabulous luxury, discrete staff, quiet welcome, this place exudes luxury. Virgin mohitjo cocktail FAB as sun was going down on the brilliantly terraced outside space. Views unparalleled. .",4,2015,09,26
28,Luxury end to a great Wine Tour,"This hotel perched at the highest point overlooking the city and out to see from Tibidabo is a special treat not to be missed. The rooms are quite luxurious, the customer service and checking / out really good and the bar and pool terrace quite stunning (but can be chilly in the evening when they bring out wraps for the ladies!) expensive and the food really good too but worth a night if you are staying for a few days.",5,2015,09,24
28,Great hotel just outside Barcelona with a spectacular view,"We really liked this place, it's peaceful and not far from Barcelona. If you like to be able to walk to everything in Barcelona it's better to choose an other Hotel because here you have to travel a bit before you are in the centre. Great pool and view, good rooms, awesome!",4,2015,09,23
28,True romantic Barcelona getaway,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. It's is beautiful beyond belief. Greeted upon arrival with fresh mint infused water and then made our way to the bar to get a snack and a beverage all while taking in the best view of the city and the Mediterranean. Our room was ready early and it blew us away. Stocked with high end toiletries from L'occitaine and 3 balconies. The bed was very comfortable and the robes were good enough that you'll want to take them home. Lit closet space space was nice especially for long stays. Nightly turndown service with fresh bottled water and chocolate was always a nice touch.
We enjoyed a Massage with lavender oils by Marta and Sarah on our first day, I highly recommend this when flying in from the US to help you get readjusted. 
You MUST opt for the daily breakfast it is AMAZING with more than enough options of protein, sweets, grains and any coffee you can imagine. Mimosas too! If they don't have the Belgian waffles on buffet, I recommend requesting an order to share. 
One highlight was a 5 hour motorcycle tour of Barcelona by Brightside Tours - best thing we did on vacation. 
This hotel has free shuttle via Mercedes van to city center, you'll want to take advantage of this as cab rides are $20 to and from, schedule these the night before. Only downside, the hotel hot tub was closed for the majority of our stay but that gives us a reason to visit again. 
Best hotel in Barcelona! Thanks to all the great staff!! Also, the hotel smells something wonderful at night, enjoy!",5,2015,09,22
28,Excellent stay and superb service,"Words really can't express how lovely our stay at Gran Hotel La Florida was.  The hotel is lovely with a classy old-school vibe I adore. 

We had a suite overlooking the city from the mountains to the shore.  The room was clean and neat with cool furniture and the most comfortable bed.  

The hotel and grounds are actually quite accessible and there's a shuttle to town as well as taxis and a bus stop right beside the hotel.  

Everything was spectacular at the hotel, but most of all and most importantly--the staff.  Everyone at Gran La Florida is top-notch especially Marta who worked with my fiancé to plan our engagement.  Marta is extremely friendly and was so helpful in arranging the best engagement surprise.  From the candles and lights, to the champagne and photos of a wonderful night, she made the evening so special! 

Gran Hotel La Florida will always have a special place in our hearts and we can't wait to come back!",5,2015,09,22
28,Great experience!,"The Gran Hotel La Florida is a beautiful hotel with a magnificent view. The rooms are ample, comfortable, and stunning, with high ceilings, diamond finish plaster walls, balconies, and fantastic bathrooms finished entirely in stone. The view is spectacular. The service is great, the pool is amazing, and the bar restaurant is excellent.  The only ding on the property is that it is located next to what appears to be the largest microwave antennae on earth - quite literally, a ten story building on a spike, radiating so much energy you can almost feel it on the terrace. The view of Barcelona is beyond compare.",4,2015,09,19
28,A spectacular hotel with Excellent service,"We stayed for a 5 night break to celebrate my 60th Birthday and I can honestly say that this was one of the loveliest hotels we have ever stayed in. Our suite Room 605 afforded us with spectacular 360 degree views from our HUGE private and not overlooked terrace equipped with dining table and chairs, sun loungers and a jacuzzi. The suite was huge with windows all around to take advantage of the views of the mountains and Coast with huge patio doors onto the terrace. The bathroom included a separate loo bigger than most people's en-suites, the huge shower could easily accommodate 8 people with a view of the mountains! A huge bath again as you lay there taking in the wonderful view from the large windows in addition to 2 large his and hers basins with large mirror above. If you can tear yourself away from the suite and to be honest we had room service on the terrace several times, which was brought to us by the most accommodating waiters and the fastest room service we have ever experienced and even more unbelievably at no additional charge. I don't really know where to start to describe the breakfast which is served by a brigade of fantastic staff who take pleasure in serving you and absolutely demonstrate what excellent customer service is. The breakfast is worth every penny and consists of basically anything you can imagine for breakfast and more. From freshly baked croissants, breads, cheeses, cold meats, flans, donuts, smoked salmon, a wide selection of eggs, omelettes, waffles, bacon, porridge, yogurts and an array of fresh fruit to rival any good green grocer. Oh and I nearly forgot an endless supply of fruit juices, orange, peach, grapefruit and even a bucks fiz if you desire and although you may help yourself to a range of teas and coffee, cappuccinos are also provided again at no additional charge. The terrace bar serves great food by the wonderful swimming pool which is heated and the jacuzzi is just fantastic to relax in at the end of a busy day sight seeing. What a pleasure to return to this hotel from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona which is only 25 minutes away in the hotels transport which again is free and goes into the city twice a day driven by the exceptionally courteous and helpful chauffeur Alex, yes you have to book, but we went in to the city and back 3 times and had no issues in reserving our seats. And now for Marta in Guest Relations again is the perfect example of excellent customer service she organised my romantic dinner for 2 on our terrace, organised my birthday cake freshly prepared by the excellent hotel chefs, roses were delivered to me along with a bottle of complimentary Fizz. Wow Wow Wow is all I can say, this hotel is all about excellent customer service any issues are dealt with promptly and efficiently, the staff take a pride in everything they do, they really seem to enjoy being of service to you, the hotel exudes elegance and sophistication and we enjoyed every minute of our stay, I cannot rate this hotel highly enough and look forward to returning. Thank you everyone at the hotel for an amazing time and for reminding us what true excellent service is.",5,2015,09,17
28,Amazing stay,"We stayed here after a long journey from NZ.  The hotel is very awesome.  We stayed in room 408 which is a corner room with spectacular views to the sea, city and hills.  The bed was so comfortable and the pillows bliss.   It's a great place to stay to relax, with good sun loungers, and pool.  The bathrooms are huge with shower room, bath and double basins.   Lucas the concierge was fantastic and very informative.  The shuttle service to town is free, but do book ahead.  We had no problems with bookings.  If you want to taxi to the city its between 20 to 25 euro.   Breakfast was good.  Main restaurant menu is limited but suited our needs.   I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2015,09,14
28,The best hotel in Barcelona ,An overall great hotel with the most friendly staff. As we entered the luxurious mountain top hotel the staff welcomed us graciously and provided us with complimentary refreshments. We wished to upgrade our room and within moments were provided with a FREE UPGRADE to a suite! The concierge service was amazing and extremely well informed and definitely made our stay fun and enjoyable. MUST STAY THERE,5,2015,09,04
28,Excellent hotel high above Barcelona with stunning views.,"If you are looking for a 5* hotel located away from (but with easy access to) to the biz of Barcelona, then look no further.

The Gran La Florida is located next to Tipidaba theme park on a hill high above the city and a visit to the park and the nearby church is essential.

The rooms/suites are spacious with large bathrooms (nice toiletries) and great views from most angles.

Breakfast is not bad either and may be taken inside or out depending on the weather.

The spa is nice but the ""cool"" pool is very cold so be prepared for a brief dip. The Jacuzzi is a welcome retreat.

The staff are all very pleasant and prices are pretty good for this level of luxury.

All in all, we would certainly return.

Incidentally the tapas are great especially the tuna tartare with caviar!",5,2015,09,03
28,Amazing view with prices to match,"Our first assigned suite was a disaster. Though very large, the patio appeared to abutt a playground and bus stop. Worse, though, and I'm still shocked by this, the very large bedroom window overlooked the indoor pool. Every child's voice in the pool echoes up into the bedroom. Initially a language barrier hindered my ability to explain why this room was unacceptable. We were then given a suite with a spectacular view of Barcelona and an expansive terrace with hot tub to enjoy the view. Shower was amazing and we loved the electric blinds to shutter everything at once. Big complaint was that the air conditioning never worked properly. After weeks of 90 degree heat, the room would never cool down. We closed all the blinds and had them fill the outdoor hot tub with cold water. The air conditioning should work and it did not.

Not a good location if you seek conveniences. Food is not very good yet extremely overpriced because there is no where to go. Luckily we discovered public transportation. A bus stop right outside the door goes directly to the city center and back. When booking, I mistakenly assumed there would be a cafe or something in the vicinity. They even charge €3 for one coffee pod for the espresso machine in the rooms.

If you want to be outside of Barcelona to regroup from crowds and pollution this is a good choice. We had already spent a month traveling and wanted to escape the heat and crowds for a relaxing recharge before heading home.",3,2015,09,02
28,Great 5 Star Hotel with panoramic views!,"
WoW!!! What a Great hotel. Friendly staff. Excellent service. We really enjoyed the sky terrace suite with fantastic view of Barcelona and a jacuzzi. Also a very good Coco Mat bed. We now want one at our home! Thank you very much for the lovely stay and we hope to come back someday ... Soon",5,2015,09,01
28,"Spectacular views, dreamy hotel! ","This hotel is out of this world. Extremely romantic and the views of Barcelona are spectacular. Our room had a balcony looking into the diagonal you could see for miles. It's worth getting up to see the sun rise it's like something from a movie. 
The inside pool leads out to the outdoor, perfect for cooling off. 
There is a very strange but cool fun park close by with rickety roller coasters and also has a great view as you all around. I wasn't brave enough to go on anything up at that height! 
We stayed for 5 days of luxury. I've been to Barcelona many times before so it was not about staying in the city. Getting into Barcelona from the mountain is either expensive or lengthy do we tended to pack sight seeing and day trips in so we weren't tracking back up to the hotel. It was a very welcome peaceful setting away from the hustle of the city. I would love to return one day it was definitely one of the most classy dreamy hotels I've ever stayed in.  ",5,2015,08,19
28,Has great potential,Hotel is in a great position at top of Tibidabo mountain.  It is away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to visit being only 5 kilometres away. Staff were very young and very friendly and could not do enough for you. They had been well trained in customer service. We had a lovely room 207 with wonderful views over the city. Food at breakfast was quite good but we were not initially told we could order eggs etc..from the kitchen..  Meals at night were also quite good but food sometimes was not hot and needs to be from a 5 star hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it.,4,2015,08,11
28,Gorgeous hotel with stunning views,"Visited as a couple, found a great deal on Secret Escapes for this 5* hotel. We had a junior suite, which was just breath taking. Very clean and modern, with gorgeous views over the city. Easy access into the city via public transport. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,04
28,A nice place overlooking Barcelona with easy access to the city,"The room was great, but I am not sure if it is the right place for families with children. The restaurant menu needs to have better variety. 
The hotel scent is great, very nice.
the staff are very helpful, yet when you are checking out you need to check your bill carefully, as they will add things to it. In addition, when you buy things from the concierge, or the reception, make sure you have a copy of the bill.",4,2015,08,02
28,The best hotel for Barcelona - high class and a view to impress,"From arrival the hotel set the standard. Bags taken to our rooms, a welcome greating and cooling drink. Escorted to our rooms and what a room. With crisp linen and Occitane toiletries provided the room had all the comforts you would expect from a good 5 star hotel. We had room 104 which is probably the best room with a view over all of Barcelona and a terrace from which to enjoy this catching some sun or relaxing in the evening. The restaurant was reasonably priced and offered excellent food. Breakfast was   pleasant taken on the restaurant terrace with a wide choice of fresh fruits, yogurts, meats, pastries and cheeses with freshly squeezed orange juice. I cannot fault this hotel. This was only further improved by the service. The concierges were brilliant and truly made our holiday suggesting some great restaurants and activities around the city. I would not have know of these or found them with the concierges. Nothing was too much trouble. We will return.....soon.",5,2015,07,29
28,"Amazing place, breathtaking views","The place has exceeded our expectations. The views were just breathtaking, especially at night. The facilities are excellent, the 37 meter pool was a special treat and in immaculate condition. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The food was excellent. You have to try the La Florida cocktail.
There is a free shuttle bus and the public bus (less than 3 euros) outside the hotel to the city centre, or a taxi for less than 20 euros. 
The staff were just amazing, they would go an extra mile to accommodate their guests and make them feel comfortable. Special mention for Marta and Abel for helping organise our romantic event in the Hotel La Florida, it turned to be a mega special because of your help.
We are looking forward to return soon.",5,2015,07,24
28,An amazing location,"Had another great stay at the Florida. The tranquility in relation to the buzz of Barcelona is great. The comfort in the rooms is excellent, and we would recommend the front rooms with balcony. To see Barcelona spread out at night is an amazing site. being so close to walking in the Colserola is a great advantage. The swimming pool is great for an early morning work out!
Only flaws: 1. the parking charge of 20 Euros a day, even when the car is left outside is excessive and ridiculous. 2. we had a run in with one of the concierge staff who certainly was unaware of his place in the food chain and was certainly not an advert for the hotel! 3. Although the staff are great, the quality of the food in the terrace area was poor.
Otherwise, for the view we will be back.",4,2015,07,09
28,"Excellent hotel, on the cool hill of Tibidabo","This is an excellent hotel with an unbeatable view of Barcelona.
The staff was extremely helpful and attentive to all my requests. 
The tasting menu in the restaurant really lived up to the (high) expectations, and set the right tone for this once-in-a-lifetime night. It is a truly romantic setting where you can enjoy delicious local food, overlooking the city of Barcelona.",5,2015,07,05
28,Resort on Hill Near Centre of City,"This is a beautiful historic hotel located on a hilltop adjacent to the famous park with the amusement rides at the top of the funicular. Very privately sited so that the noise of the park is not a problem, the hotel has a great outlook over the city and waterfront. Although we had a magnificent suite, we spent most of our non-sleeping and touring hours on the decks and in the pool. The breakfast is quite good, although the eggs were disappointing, but great coffee, breads, etc. But eating outdoors made it extra special. We ate dinner there two nights which was delicious, and not badly priced. The Spanish wines were superb. Staff were all fantastic and fun, while the guests were generally interesting and outgoing. Travel into the centre is easy, either by hotel shuttle, a very good and frequent bus service that stops outside the hotel, or for a longer more charming journey up the Blue Tram and then the Funicular. This is a truly special hotel.",5,2015,07,04
28,"Great views, nice experience!","Had a very relaxing stay here. The hotel ticks lots of boxes - great views, friendly service, excellent pool, the whole place very spacious and calm. Breakfast was excellent and dinner pretty good if slightly overpriced. It's an enjoyable 10 minute walk to the Tibidabo amusement park (which you don't really hear from the hotel). 
Only niggles were a rather poor gym, expensive parking and sometimes a long wait before you catch a waiter's eye.  
Having already been to Barcelona a few times, we wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city and this was the perfect choice. The free shuttle service into town was a nice bonus.
Would probably return but you do need to have a room with a view to enjoy the full potential of this hotel.",4,2015,07,02
28,Good view of Barcelona in the distance,"Fabulous for one or 2 nights as a getaway. It has a lovely pool, spa and views of Barcelona.  I paid a little extra for a room with a big balcony. The Michelin starred restaurant is closed on a Sunday and unluckily for us it was closed on the Saturday too for a wedding. This left us with the limited café menu for both days. (So check when you book about the openings as the other restaurants open on a Sunday are a 15 minute taxi ride ). It is only close to a gorgeous church and the amusement park. It is not for people who want to explore Barcelona, but would have been ideal as relaxation spot for a couple of days. There is a shuttle bus into the centre of Barcelona.",4,2015,06,30
28,Sadness ,"Ok, I will star saying that this was our second time on this hotel 5 years ago we celebrate our 10 anniversary in Barcelona, know for
our 15 we really want to came back after the 1st excellent visit we have on 2010, but not always seconds are good;we really love to travel and we know the criteria for a 5 star Hotel and it was so sad to find out the hotel it was far from that criteria the first think they never have any special detail for our anniversary, and they know it was our second time celebrating with them, then the  first room they give us it was on a lower floor with beautiful;but outside the room it was always a service cart that didn't feel very nice;and other details like drapes were missing some hook, we ask for a different room and we have it
but until our second night and even they told us don't worry we take care of the transfer and
we are going to give you a most beautiful room it was not that much of a difference, the personal some times are kind other times are talking between each other on Catalan and you don't understand, we'll we definitely we don't recommend you spend your money just for a view of Barcelona that you can get in other places.",2,2015,06,29

Pity as property is quite Nice 
As member of leaders club of leaving hôtels of the world we expected a better expérience  but not we évén had to ask for all amenities due In the programm",2,2015,06,28
28,Wonderful and relaxing week ,"Great service, beautiful setting, very comfortable rooms, average food which is a seemed a bit too pricey in my view. Amazing Loccitane spa. Would go again and again :)

A bit far from town and the beach but there is a shuttle bus every two hours. Costs about  €30 to get taxi from hotel to town, beach or airport. Of course Barcelona itself is an amazing city.  ",5,2015,06,21
28,World class view of Barcelona and world class service!,"You must stay here at least once when you're in Barcelona.  The view of the city is second to none, the staff and service are great and the spa is one of the best I've been to.  Once you get to the top of the hill, pull into the hotel and walk out onto the back deck with a beer you know you've arrived.  It is a literal breathtaking perspective of the city.  You can see all of the points of interest and you have a panorama from the airport and beyond.  Some people have had bad experiences, but I've had nothing but top flight service.  I've stayed many times an the concierge, reception, cleaning staff and room service are all exceptional.  If you tip reasonably at all they will literally bend over backwards for you.  I'm not saying tipping is necessary, I'm just saying they really appreciate it.  Finally, if you want to spend a weekend of zen like relaxing away from it all, the spa has many top notch treatments and products that will definitely lighten your blood pressure.  The treatments will also lighten your wallet, but great top quality service is not and should not be cheap.  Like my dad always said, you get what you pay for... if you're lucky!  By the way, the best thing you can do is order Hamon Iberico de Bellota, pan con tomate and an a bottle of Estrella and sit at a table on the back deck looking over the city and realize that there is a God and he has been good to you!",5,2015,06,18
28,Fantastic View!,"Stayed 5 days at La Florida! The reataurant is amazing, the spa is relaxing, the view is fantastic, the service is really good. I loved the reisling wine, the massage was great! Amazing  Sunset and Sunrise., also get the view of the whole barcelona city from the restaurant, just WOW ! ",5,2015,06,17
28,Paradise on the top of Tibidabo,"Everything was brilliant, the trip to hotel goes uphill serpentine road and offers fascinating views, hotel itself is luxury in every detail -aromas, tastes, feelings and professional staff made us feel very special and happy! Definitely visit the cathedral at night - the view is fantastic!",5,2015,06,16
28,6th visit to a wonderful hotel,"We have visited 6 times now, returning again last week for Nother wonderful experience. Yet sheer tranquility of the view of Barcelona is a sight to behold, being so high up in the mountains makes this hotel unique. 

The atmosphere here always feels laid back, relaxed and languid. Also a great place to people watch as there is often something going on of interest and intrigue.

We had booked a sea view terrace room. We had a couple of hiccups on arrival, firstly the receptionist said we couldn't use Amex, when we actually could, then our room was at the back of the hotel, not as requested. The hotel sorted this immediately with zero fuss, so we'll done on that.

Others have highlighted little maintenance issues which I'd echo. The waterfall feature has now not worked for over 3 years, it should be functional really and also the glass separating the outside pool to inside wasn't working either, again a must for a 5 star hotel to have its features working A1. Also each time we called a taxi the desk normally ring to say it's arrived which didn't happen this time save for the taxi to the airport. Last but not least this must be the only hotel in the World were you cannot watch a film. A few years back we were told the hotel was changing providers and it would be sorted out soon. So I really would give that consideration.

The staff are lovely,mark and friendly. I am going to single out Hugo, how have we missed him before? We had room service a few times and he was just an absolute pleasure and a credit to the hotel.

We will definitely be back",4,2015,06,11
28,Overall enjoyed my visit here. Stunning view if that is what you are after.,"I had an overall good experience here but unsure I would go back. It is definitely in the higher price range but some parts are worth it since it did have some very special good bits. The view is what really sells the place. You basically pay for the view. In my opinion, the view was worth the extra money for this time but if you aren't into an amazing view, might not be worth it. You can always visit the attraction for a few hours which is 2 minutes from the hotel.

There are much better 5 star hotels out there. The service on entry was slightly above average. We were shown to our room which was very nice but on the ground floor so the trees blocked the view. Luckily they had a room on the 4th floor with the ideal view so we took it. The room was smaller but well worth the view as this is what I paid more for to come here. This hotel can definitely be better maintained for the price that people pay to stay here. They missed some details like coffee and tea in the rooms and there were some little scratches and stains here and there which in my opinion shouldn't be present in a 5 star hotel. The money they charge should be put to raising the standards. But wasn't a huge deal and was acceptable. 

Barcelona by night was just stunning and the room service was a nice added touch for a romantic in-room dinner. Comfortable bed. Shame we couldn't see out the bathroom window as it was covered in limescale so no bath with a view. Again another detail a 5 star hotel should really put right. There was a bit of rubbish by the bin when we came as well which shouldn't have been there. Nice pool and overall a very nice hotel but just felt it missed the 5 star mark in terms of attention to detail. 

Considering its not a huge hotel and the prices are extortionate, I really did expect the attention to detail aspect which unfortunately was missed but as it was a special occasion, (my 25th Birthday) it was worth it for a few special moments. The hotel didn't acknowledge at all that it was my birthday as well which I feel is really something a 5 star hotel would note. Even the immigration guy wished me on my way back to England but no wish or anything from the hotel. Any other hotel I have been to has always acknowledged the special occasion in some way even if a small gesture such as a cupcake and little card but nothing at all from them on this special occasion. 
In terms of the food, the restaurant was closed so we had to have the bar food and that was one of the worst meals we had. Considering this is a 5 star hotel this was shameful! Very poor lunch. However, the dinner was good. Not amazing, but good. maybe 2-3 star standard food.

In short, it was worth it for the visit and for the view but unfortunately, I would not go back as it is not good value with the lack of attention to details and lack of above average food. Service not great at the restaurant and no friendly farewell from the lady who checked us out. Even though there were some very good bits, as I would not return, sadly I have to mark it as a poor rating.",2,2015,06,10
28,Beautiful setting. Stunning hotel. Faultless service. The perfect place for a wedding proposal...,"Where do I start? This may be a long review but worth reading I hope!

I had been planning on proposing to my now fiancée for a few months. I came across this hotel and fell in love with its setting, it's splendour and its romance. I booked the Crocella Sky Suite which is one of the best rooms available due to its enormous city/sea-view terrace which I decided was to be the location of my proposal.

My idea was to go for a romantic meal in the city beforehand and while we were out, the hotel would arrange an array of candles, rose petals and the like to be set up on the terrace for when we returned. 

The star of the show was the Guest Relations Manager, Marta Duran. She arranged everything and kept in touch for over 5 weeks before our arrival, ensuring this very personal request was dealt with with the utmost care and attention it deserved. Marta also kept the ring in the hotel safe for two weeks before we arrived. We stayed with friends in France for a week before so I decided to send it to the hotel so I could relax and not stress about it being found! 

When we arrived at the hotel Marta showed us around and took us to up to the room. I had told my fiancée that I had booked somewhere different, and as soon as she saw the room and the view from the terrace she burst into tears (of happiness!).

On the evening of the proposal, Marta and her colleague went to our room while we were out and set everything up for our return. When we got back, I led my fiancée onto the terrace and proposed. Thankfully she said yes! Marta stayed an extra two or three hours later than she should have done to wait until we were on our way back to set up the terrace.

The hotel was outstanding. Without wanting to sound too pompous, I have stayed in some very special hotels over the years, but without doubt this was by far the most special. Though I have rightly singled out Marta for her exceptional service, the rest of the staff were incredible - friendly, helpful, polite and always there to help. Many of them were also in on the secret and congratulated us the following day. The food was exquisite, the spa and its masseuses were fantastic, and even the secret perfume in the lobby was amazing!

In total we stayed for 4 days. We took the free shuttle bus into the city every day and explored its sights. It is a truly incredible city and a must-visit when you get the chance.

Thank you to Marta and the rest of the staff at the Gran Hotel La Florida for giving us a holiday that neither of us will ever forget. 

We will most certainly come back.",5,2015,06,06
28,Heaven on the Hill,"This was a surprise birthday treat for my partner's 50th birthday which did not disappoint! The hotel is superb with a fantastic team working there who make you feel at home immediately. The furnishings and interior design of this stylish hotel high up on Tibidabo mountain are lush yet simple, and there is a wonderful perfume in the air which might have something to do with the L'Occitaine spa and boutique on-site!!
We can highly recommend having a spa treatment too - especially the 90 minute intense deep tissue relaxing massage. The steam-room, sauna, jacuzzi and the indoor/outdoor pools are a pleasure to drift lazily from one to the other.
Our Junior suite was possibly one of the best in the hotel - on the 3rd floor with a whole corner balcony facing the sea and city as well as westward towards the mountains and the amusement park and cathedrals. We had some of the best quality sleep ever too! The view at night across the city is breathtaking, as is the sunrise.
The staff in reception cannot do enough for you, and we must mention Luciano from the poolside bar who is just delightful and so helpful about where to go and visit in the city. He was right about the Parc de la Ciutadella - it's one of the best parks we've ever visited. Thanks also for the surprise birthday cake!
Despite the distance into town meaning getting your head around the myriad of public transport systems and their somewhat ambiguous timetables, it was worth every minute of effort; though 4 days was no way near enough to see the whole city and surrounding areas. Taxis are the other option, but be sure to agree the price - they are random...
To simply go to La Florida to chill out, away from the city heat and smog is an absolute must - even if for a few days to recover from the city's temptations, sights and sounds, or perhaps do it the other way round! 
Thank you Marta for all your help, and the same goes to the bar/restaurant staff and room service too! The owners and management of this hotel should be proud to have such a great team working for them. Hang on to them or lose them at your peril!!",5,2015,06,05
28,Amazing hotel in an equally amazing city,"My husband and I together with his son, stayed at this hotel over Easter of this year.  We found the service and rooms to be of an excellent standard and the setting is perfect.  After a day spent in the city this hotel offers peace and calm and is a wonderful place to return to.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing break in Barcelona and hope to return one day.",5,2015,05,29
28,Relaxation with an amazing view,"My husband spent 4 glorious days at this hotel last week. The setting is spectacular and the hotel is very relaxing. 
We had a terrace room overlooking the mountains which had afternoon sun. The room was a very good size with a great bathroom which had a large walk in shower. 
The hotel is filled with a citrus aroma and is simply furnished but very luxurious. 
We felt extremely comfortable there!
We spent our days sunbathing on the terrace and having treatments in the spa! The breakfast was very good with a large selection of high quality foods. The evening menu was a little limited but all the food was fresh and tasty!
We went down to Barcelona for 2 dinners, the taxi was 20 Euros.
Having been to Barcelona before we chose this hotel to be away from the hustle of the city, so the location was perfect for us.
",5,2015,05,28
28,Room with an amazing view!,"La Florida has a grand Hollywood style about it, sitting aloof from the bustle Barcelona up on Tibidabo hill. The hotel takes full advantage of the view with many bedrooms, the bar, restaurant and the pool flanking the coastal horizon. The staff were extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for you (I left a bag at La Prat golf club and they bent over backwards retrieving it for me at no charge). The beautiful and spacious rooms were turned down in the evening but perhaps could do with more detailed maid service. The eggs benedict needed more love and although the breakfast selection didn't look massively impressive, the kitchen would get you anything you asked for. I would recommend the hotel for a getaway but remember there is a 20-25 minute drive into town (traffic was bad the week we visited). We were there primarily for a business trip and it was perfect for this purpose, also possibly for a honeymoon couple or groups who enjoy eachothers' company - but for the keen tourist it might be too far from town? Overall we felt quite the movie stars staying here.",4,2015,05,26
28,Best Service Ever,On e hour before leaving for the flight to Barcelona we got a call from La Florida advising us that our room was not available for our first night and they were moving us to their sister hotel The Miramar. Great start to our break! We were given a lovely room there and next day we went sightseeing and our luggage was moved to La Florida. The staff in both hotels were superb. La Florida is a stunning property and a brilliant base for visiting Barcelona. Just use the bus into the city centre. The Miramar too has a great harbour location and a special mention to their restaurant staff. A great example of making the best of a tricky situation. Well done & thanks.,5,2015,05,18
28,The best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"Everything about the hotel is amazing: The rooms are well laid out, spacious and neatly adorned with high quality bedding, towels and toiletry products (L'Occitane). The pool and terrace area with sweeping views of the city are absolutely breathtaking! But the best part of our stay was the lengths the staff went to to ensure our stay was perfect, they went out of there way to help us in any way they could and were polite and always smiling :) If I have one criticism, it is the price of the breakfast which was just ridiculous (€35). Although some have mentioned the location as a problem there are four shuttle buses to and from the city and we never had a problem with booking them. There is also a bus that runs from beside the hotel right into the centre of Barcelona. I suppose the moral of the story is if you want to be in the middle of town, don't stay here. But if you want to be within a very manageable distance and have one of the best hotel experiences available, this is the hotel for you!",5,2015,05,11
28,La Gran Dame of Hotels,"Overview: This building has been brilliantly restored, preserving slightly creaky wood floors and thick, ornate doors but adding modern touches that make this a luxury location. Waterfalls everywhere cleverly mask the faint screams from the roller coaster nearby and scents from L' Occitane freshen the corridors. However, if you take a peek under this chic grande dames' skirts you find tiny maintenance issues that speak to an innability to maintain the high quality to which this property once aspired. The fountains toward the mountain side and in the main lobby no longer function. The clever solar system used to heat the pool has a tree through it. However there are still luxuries to be had; the water area with its sumptuous changing rooms, sauna and beautiful pool are worth the climb. The meals, while limited in variety and overpriced, are very good. And the view is world class and well worth any imperfection. 
Pros: Location high above the city, a quiet retreat, walking distance to Tibidabo, an amusement park circa 1899 and an amazing cathedral (where you can buy reasonably priced water and snacks, or ride the funicular down to some cliff side tapas bars!), beautiful pool and spa, L' Occitane bath products in the rooms and the best hotel bath towels I've ever encountered, spacious rooms that retain the feel of old luxury, AWESOME showers, good food, excellent staff.
Cons: Location; not much nearby but the amusement park so be prepared to just relax; food prices were a bit high for meals and just plain silly for breakfast, there wasn't a lot of variety to the menu, often felt it was hard to get wait staffs attention after your order was placed, it would have been nice to have more shade on the terraces, the room doors don't have a secondary lock inside (so staff can enter by mistake and did so twice).",4,2015,05,05
28,"""Wonderful Restaurant with great service""","The restaurant located in the Gran Hotel La Florida is absolutely charming, modern, with a breathtaking views of Barcelona.I personally proposed  that evening to my girlfriend to be my wife, and it was the best location to do so. The co-operation from the staff lead by Miriam cortijo is outstanding. Isaac Lozano organised everything, also the small details to be a perfect night. Luciano and Joan perfect waiters. This was a great experience, a great evening, and needless to say the food was excellent. The timing of all courses brilliantly. Service outstanding.",5,2015,04,26
28,Beautiful Hotel and wonderful staff,"Family of 3 including 8yr old stayed for 3 nights. Beautiful hotel with lovely decor and furnishings. Stayed in room 507 lovely big corner room with 2 large windows giving perfect views over the hillside and city. Yes the location is out of town but that's why we chose it! Transport not difficult nor expensive. Free shuttle bus into town has only a few seats and does get booked up however the T2A public bus just outside the hotel goes every 20min throughout the day costs Euro 2.95pp to Placa Cataluyna. Or taxi to metro/funicular railway nearby then get T10 ticket (10 trips on one ticket so multiple people can use same ticket). Taxi back from town between Euro12-25 depending where you caught it (ie Gracia / Placa Cataluyna). By the way cab to airport at 0915 on a Monday morning took only 35min and cost Euro 40 including 3 bags.
The hotel itself is a 5 star although some websites rate as 4 star (don't know why). We have stayed in many 5 star throughout the world and this is as good as any of them. Room was large and beautiful, as was bathroom (excellent powerful shower could hold 3!). Very comfortable and good free Wi-Fi. Pool was great indoor and outdoor and outside terraced area perfect for relaxing with fab views. 
However the most important thing was how as a guest you are made to feel and all the staff were absolutely superb. Faultless. Particular mention must go to front desk of Patricia, Mariona and Nora and also Mehmet in the restaurant. All exceptionally friendly and professional. Once when the shuttle had been overbooked in error they immediately arranged for a taxi gratis for us without question. 
The hotel is on top of the mountain where you get a lot of mountain bikers and joggers. The air is clean and crisp with stunning sunrises and sunsets.  Unfortunately there is in our view a rather tacky theme park nearby but you could not really see or hear it from the hotel so the beautiful calm and serene tranquillity remained.
The food and drink was excellent including buffet breakfast. There were many families with young children all made to feel welcome which you don't often find in 5 stars that also clearly attract an affluent and business clientele.
Its a really really lovely place to stay and we will definitely be visiting again with family and friends. The management should be rightfully proud of the hotel and its exceptional staff. One thing we would like to add - one night we left it a little late getting the train back from town and just missed the last bus from the last stop on the funicular railway (at Vallvidrera). We were helped by a succession of generous and kind Spanish people both young and old in eventually succeeding via train and shared taxi getting back to the hotel. You hear a lot about pick pockets and such in BCN and no doubt they are there but everyone we met was kind and helpful. Many thanks to them indeed.",5,2015,04,21
28,Lovely hotel for family stay,"Family of 4 ( kids 10,8) visited over Easter holidays. Landed at 11am and 25 minute taxi cost 34 euros. I had a confirmed early check in ( 40 euros) but room wasn't ready and we weren't charged. The room was ready by the time we'd had lunch.
The room was incredibly spacious with lovely views. As is vital when travelling with kids the air con was excellent. Only 3 English channels on TV - 2 news, 1 Disney. Wi-Fi superb - both kids streamed constantly on  iPads without problems - vital when they're this age - and it's free!!
Restaurant charges 22 euro for hamburger, 19 euro for roast beef sandwich. Limited but delicious Tapas menu. Food was lovely and we also partook of the tasting menu in L'Orangerie. It was weird and different but truly enjoyable. The waiting staff in L'Orangerie were friendly and charming and accommodated children without a problem. I cannot praise them enough.
Gin and Tonic 16 euros. Chocolate milk 5 euros. Beer 6 euros.
We took a taxi into Placa Catalyuna each day - never more than 20 euros.
Outdoor pool small and cool ( it's April). Indoor pool narrow but the kids loved it.
The staff are lovely and enthusiastic but having decent Spanish definitely helps. And, unless you speak Spanish or Catalan, get the concierge to deal with taxis!
The "" shuttle service"" is useless. 70 room hotel runs a 6 seater minivan into the city 3 times a day. In spite of being told we couldn't book it in advance of our break, it was booked up the entire week. Make your own plans!
Difficult to judge..... Rooms need a bit of a touch up - damaged paint work, leaky showers. But, it is quiet ( after the madness of the city), cool and extremely comfortable. The extensive hallways and vast spaces make sure you get a peaceful nights sleep. In fact, as a family we all commented we have never slept as well in a hotel. It is extremely quiet.
Would summarise as 4 star + facilities, 5 star prices.
If I returned to Barcelona, I'd return here. It made my kids so happy.

28,"Fantastic hotel, incredible views!","I've never written a review before but I felt like I had to after our stay here. I cannot fault anything from the minute we arrived when we were offered champagne on arrival to the minute we left! 
We stayed in a junior suite which was beautiful and spacious...huge comfy bed! The views over the city from our balcony were something else, just incredible. Perfect to come back to and relax after a busy day sight seeing in the city. The food in the lobby bar was delicious, although a little pricey, but you pay for the quality. All of the staff are so friendly and can't do enough for you. 
Don't let the location put you off as the hotel is situated on top of a hill, it's easy enough to get into the city. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus that runs 3 times a day which is very handy, but you do need to book onto it as it only seats 6. Otherwise the T2A public bus runs every 20 minutes from right outside the hotel for just 3€, both take you right into the centre.
Staying here made our holiday, it wouldn't have been the same in any other hotel, it was perfect! Would definitely recommend and will stay again next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2015,04,15
28,Lovely long weekend,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a long weekend after we found a great deal online.

We loved our stay here!! Yes, the hotel is right on top of the mountain and is far from the city centre but we enjoyed this. The hotel provides a shuttle bus into the town centre for free but we always got a taxi back up which was generally quite expensive.

The views from our balcony were breath-taking. You can see the entire city. Was so nice to relax on the balcony with those views. 

The rooms were really nice and had everything we needed. Was so nice to come back to the room after a day in the city to find music playing in the room and everything cleaned and looking nice.

We did not eat in the hotel as it was so expensive.

The pool faciltiies are nice and large and never seemed to get too busy.

We went for a walk around the top of the mountain and found the theme park that’s up on it with the hotel. Was a fun little distraction for a couple of hours.

Overall I really cannot knock the hotel. Except for the cost of food and drink at the hotel there were no negatives. We knew we would be outside of town and were prepared to pay for taxi’s etc to get to and from it. It should not be a surprise to people who book.",5,2015,04,14

28,Peace and Calm away from the city,"Just returned from a four day break at La Florida. 

It was such a relaxing holiday. Totally recommend to anyone who wants a balance between city break with a tranquil oasis to return to...this is for you!

Particular note were all the helpful friendly staff, particularly a young lady(sorry didn't get her name) who greeted us each morning for breakfast service showing us to our table always with a smile. Jose who was always on hand to supply coffee and juice at breakfast and drinks from the bar and all the concierge who were helpful and willing to advise on any information required. 

Breakfast was a buffet choice, cooked, pastries or fruit....or all three and all wonderful.

We ate in the restaurant on first night and this was reasonably priced. Drinks weren't cheap 6€ for glass of wine and 11€ for a Mojito (but it was worth it). 

The minibus (make sure you book) goes down to the centre 3 times a day and then you need to navigate your own way back via metro to Penitents and then get a taxi from the hospital nearby (a little way up the hill). Get a T10 for metro travel (gives you 10 trips for one person or 5 for two) and costs less than 10€. 

Taxi from Airport was 39€ but on our way back we used the minibus shuttle to town and then the RENF (using our last T10 trips) to airport which was efficient and easy. 

Only reason for 4 not 5 stars was the access to city, or more particularly not having an evening shuttle back which would be perfect. 

Room (312) had a stunning full sea view. 

It really was a perfect mini break.",4,2015,04,13
28,Hotel at the top of the mountain with beautiful views,"PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE MAKING YOUR MIND UP: This hotel is quite far out, right at the top of the mountain which is actually 9.2 miles from the airport (it cost us 50 Euros not sure if we were conned or not though) about a 20-30 minute drive, but it is so worth it as the view of the whole city is absolutely stunning especially at night, please note that this hotel is more 4 star than 5 star as advertised.

The service at this hotel is second to none, the rooms were very clean and room service came around every afternoon to make the bed, change the towels and replace slippers and dressing robes, beware the shower doors are frosted glass, not to everyone's liking I am guessing.  I do not speak any Spanish, but it was easy to communicate with all members of staff who were attentive at all times, we got to the hotel very late at night after 11pm, we were informed that we could order room service which was quite limited at this time all that was available were sandwiches or salad, we opted for a Salmon sandwich and chips (which were actually crisps) which cost us about 20 Euros. We opted to have breakfast included which is of quite standard quality but you do have the option to order omelettes and or eggs Benedict/Florentine which are freshly made, champagne is also available as part of the buffet. The bar is open until 1am and prices differ a rum and coke cost 12 Euros, a glass of wine (6 Euros) with a bottle of soda (5 Euros) and a bottle of beer was 6 Euros compared to 3 Euros when you travelling into the city centre. We ate in the restaurant on our last night in Cafe 1925,note that there are 2 restaurants the other restaurant is more expensive and serves gourmet food, we ordered a bottle of wine and had a 3 course meal which came to about 150 Euros (there is not a vast choice on the menu).

There is an amusement park just at the top of the hill,, unfortunately there are no other amenities close by as you are on a mountain so my tip is to stock up on supplies, we ventured into the town centre on our 2nd day in order to do this you will need to wait for the T1A which costs 3 Euros per person and takes about 25 minutes and they run every 20 minutes and it takes you to plaça catalunya (town centre), there are plenty of places to eat and drink which are very cheap, we found a nice little irish pub to watch the football in and a bottle of beer was 3 Euros, further up from plaça catalunya is a strip called La Rambla, there are stalls were you can buy local goods, souvenirs and also street performers, this strip takes you onto the Marina where there are even more bars and places to eat, we were recommend a little cafe called la Malandrina where we could order steak for 8.50 Euros and I have to say its one of the best steaks i have ever had.
 
The Spa facilities at the hotel are amazing and its all free unless you take additional treatments, the Concierge at the hotel is very informative and we used his services often, ensure you take a travel adapter as the plug sockets are 2-pin, overall we are so glad we picked this hotel, some people may see it as a negative as it was in the mountains and not close by to anything, but it is so worth it for the views of the city, we loved it so much we are going back in the Summer.",5,2015,04,08
28,Amazing,"We stayed here as a family for Easter weekend. From check-in to check-out the experience was wonderful. The photos do not do the hotel justice, it is one of the most beautiful settings I have ever stayed in. We had a deluxe seaview room. The room was big and comfortable with a large bathroom, then there was the deck which was as big as the room again.
We loved the hotel so much that we spent more time there than we usually would.
The staff couldn't have been more helpful and caring. They made every effort to make sure our stay was comfortable and happy. We will definately be coming back.
The Tibidabo amusement park is a short walk from the hotel and is a lot of fun.",5,2015,04,08
28,Taxi company best customer,"My wife did it again....she does the searching on web, and always gets a bargain.....and what a great bargain she got this time. We have stayed in mid range hotels in Barcelona previousley,and when we realised we could get a bit of luxury for same price...we went for it.
OK...its a bit out of town, but just makes it a more relaxing somehow.

On arrival,you are seated in front of receptionists....and given the company welcome...over a glass of champagne....very nice. and then your shown around hotel,up to your room and then your cases arrive......all very smoothe and professional. 
We ate out in city each night,but not because the hotel chef cant cook...quite the opposite in fact ,I would say its one of the cities top eateries...and view from restaurant adds to the experience. Luckily its the same view at breakfast,and part of the deal was we were inclusive.Choice at breakfast was way above average and efficiant young staff got the day up and running.
The bedroom was spacious and clean.....slightly in need of freshening up,but whoes looking at the fabric,when the you have a fantastic view out the window/balcony over the city. There are plenty of fluffy towels,slippers etc....and should you want a spa treatment, you have the dressing gown to use to wander down in the lift.
 
As the title of review says...taxi company did a bit of business with us.....but that was through choice.If you want to get to La ramblas...just jump on the blue bus T2A for 3 euro,or you could get the 111 bus to the fenicular,and at bottom get metro to city centre....its a bit longer,but more fun.Concierge are very helpful and will advise times etc.We got taxi back each night as we were out till late......25 euro + for service. 
If future deals were on offer,I would not hesitate on booking again.....or if I ended up in another hotel,I would book a meal at the restaurant....either way I would love to return to La Florida",5,2015,04,07
28,5 star is pushing it a bit,"Where to start... 

First the good. Staff were on the whole excellent - friendly and efficient. Views are amazing. Spa treatment by Sara was fantastic. 

Not so good. Our room was VERY tired. Every wall marked or chipped, furniture outdated and bathroom needs a refurb and someone to look at the drains!

On the whole it feels like the whole place needs an overhaul, as currently is not 5 star standard and most definitely not a Leading Hotel of the World! This is a shame, as with the location they have it could be superb. 

One other thing. Taxis are a bit of an issue with regard to a supplementary charge for coming out to get you from the hotel. In three journeys we experienced a meter set to zero, one to 10 euros and one to 17 (yes, 17) euros BEFORE we set off. I refused to pay the guy the 17, which led to a bit of an exchange, but c'est la vie. The hotel told me that 10 euros is normal, although I fail to see why a taxi starts its meter in the city centre before driving the six kilometre journey to the hotel. Anyway, be warned!",3,2015,04,07
28,Beautiful hotel with exceptional views,"Although this hotel is well out of the city of Barcelona, for those of you looking for comfort , panoramic views and terrific service, The Gran Hotel LaFlorida is a must.
We had a city/sea view room on the 3rd floor, own balcony and the views over the city of Barcelona, which were fantastic.
The room and bathroom were a good size. The bed was really comfortable and there were Robes and slippers plus small fridge with drinks.
The staff were always there to greet you and assist whenever required.
Breakfast was included and there was plenty to choose from to ensure you start the day on a full stomach.
It was my wife's birthday whilst out there and on our return from a lovely meal at one of the hotel restaurants was a bottle of Cava with chocolates, from the management and staff. A really lovely gesture.
The hotel has a shuttle service to and from the city, but it can only cater for a maximum of 6 at a time. If you are unlucky an cannot book a seat on the shuttle, it is either a taxi or bus/train into the city. The taxi costs between 15 - 18 euros, each way. However, the management did everything to help with our transportation.
Drinks and food are expensive at the hotel, but then the prices reflect their 5 star status.
Tips - would recommend a city tour bus. It is a hop on-hop off bus and there are 2 main routes (red and green). The ticket caters for both routes. You can obtain 1 or 2 days pass and if you are a senior, it is discounted, but make sure you draw this to their attention.
There is also, plenty to see. Our 2.5 days was totally inadequate, which is why we will be going back.
We hope you enjoy as much as us.",5,2015,04,03
28,Gran Hotel La Florida  Hotel Barcelona Spain,"Luxury 5 Star Boutique Hotel in Barcelona. Spain. It is located in the Tibidabo Hills, with stunning panoramic views over Barcelona and the Mediterranean sea.

One of our favorite hotels in Europe.",5,2015,03,31
28,For My Husbands 61st Birthday,"We thought the Hotel and all the Staff were wonderful very attentative and well versed except for maybe one little waitress who didn't know how to make a vodka tonic with ice and lemon! When it did arrive it was very nice. After that we ordered our food we were dismayed to find that my husbads meal only consisted of meatballs no vegetables of any descriptionm My Meal did have a few daintily placed sprigs along with 4 small scallop sized slices of fish, with the 2 drinks the bill was 66euros and staggeringly my vodka was 16euros. I couldn't believe it. So we decided to catch the shuttle bus the next day and eat in the city instead. The breakfast at the hotel was very good. When we arrived back about 9pm we asked to book the shuttle again only to be told it was fully booked all day as it only goes out at 10.30 12,30 and 4.30 and holds 6 people not a lot of good really when the hotel is busy..As we were well out of town we had to catch a taxi to the nearest metro (12euros) then get the metro to town (4euros,30) so each day was costing us around 30 euros to get to the city and back We did hire a car and drove to the hotel and when we parked on the forecourt they very kindly parked it for us, It was only by accident the next day that we found out they were charging us 21 euros a day for the pleasure, So we parked it in the layby down the road,,
.If you want to be out of the city with fantastic views from either your bedroom, dining room and patio of this fantastic city and don't want a car and have plenty of money for taxis then this is the place for you.If you don,t then learn from our mistake and stay in the city. I cannot fault the hotel its breakfast or the staff and would recommend it to my friends but please supply a bigger and more frequent shuttle please. I know you want customers back in your hotel to eat but 4.30 is very early for the last shuttle and lots are still going on in the cityand not a loot in your hotel. We really enjoyed Barcelona and the food and drink in the city were very reasonable also anyone going on the  hop on hop off  bus tour do the Red route its much the better one and if you go before summer wear really warm clothes if you sit on the top of the open topped bus BRRRRR. Over all our trip was a great experience we loved the hotel but would prefer one in the city the next time. Yours Sincerely Val Jones",5,2015,03,24
28,The worst hotel I have ever stayed at.,"I've not written a review in the past about anywhere I've stayed good or bad, however, I felt compelled to write one about this hotel, due to the profound disappointment and all together, terrible experience.

This hotel looked amazing all the way from reading reading reviews, looking at the website and then the drive up to the hotel doors. From that point it was a huge disappointment and a far-cry from the 5 star treatment we were expecting.

Firstly ,no one was there to help us with our bags from the car, we actually had to search and request for a concierge to help us, then we were told we would have to pay £20 (roughly) for parking our car over- night which seemed strange considering the cost of the hotel room and as the hotel is based outside of the city, parking shouldn't be an issue or come at a cost.

There were many small problems with the room too which you do not expect from a 5 star hotel- the aircon was constantly on and broken so we were unable to turn it off or on another setting, the duvet was in between two sheets rather then being in an actual duvet cover, the sinks in the bathrooms didn't drain properly, no baby cot was provided for my son, the telephone didn't work well at al and the ""turn down"" service was so basic, a simple folding of the corners of the sheets is not a service you expect from a 5 star hotel which cost us well over £700 for 2 double rooms.

Whist I was having a massage in the spa- which was excellent (the only thing in this hotel which was any good!), my husband and his sister had a bottle of cava in the bar. When we met afterwards the mentioned the coldness of the staff- almost like they were unpleased to serve.

We booked a table at the restaurant- L'Orangerie -again the SLOWEST and COLDEST service from staff. My husband and I arrived 5 minutes later then his sister and we were not given a drinks menu, just a food menu. Finally, after asking and waiting a while we received the menu and then after another long-wait, then the waitress bring the bottle but only poured my husband and his sister a glass and didn't bother to provide me with a glass of Champagne. It was my birthday. I was so embarrassed, that I had to ask the waitress if I could have a glass too- she replied with ""Oh you want some?"" which seemed like a very poor answer considering I selected the champagne in the first place. Finally our food turned up over-priced, over-cooked and very small.
I constructively spoke to (what looked like) the head waitress there to voice my concerns on the issues with the slow, rude service, the wine issue and also the fact that the food wasn't even worth waiting for. She proceeded to argue with me and talk over me rather than listen to what I had to say and apologise.
She wasn't able to resolve the issue and dealt with the whole scenario very badly.

In the morning when we checked out, we spoke to the reception and put forward a formal complaint, the reception were polite but no offer of compensation was offered, we paid the full amount for our stay, however, one week laster I am still waiting for them to release the £700 (roughly) holding deposit they took on my card for arrival. Nightmare.",1,2015,02,25
28,Amazing weekend stay!,"We are a mid 20's couple who stayed here for valentines weekend and I cannot fault the hotel. 

As soon as I walked in I was in awe of how beautiful the place looked and how clean it was.  We were greeted and taken to our room straight away, which got upgraded on arrival without is asking... However if it wasn't for me taking my credit card I am unsure how we would have been allowed to stay, as you have to leave a swipe at reception for additional extras (please note it can ONLY be a credit card). 

It cost us roughly €45 in a taxi from the airport, but the views on the way to the top were worth it. 

I highly recommend the dinner in Cafe 1925 (I think it's called this). The food was an amazing standard and not overpriced at all. 
Although the hotel seems far away, it is worth it for the breath taking views you get 24/7. You can very easily catch a bus for €2 to the train station then get a €10 ticket for 10trips to the city centre. This was easy to get around and only took about half an hour. 

Overall the hotel was clean, had stunning views, the spa was lovely, staff were friendly and the food was amazing. 
I would recommend this hotel to any couples looking for a get away with the fun of Barcelona centre by day and breath taking views over a cocktail by night. 

Would definitely stay here again!! 
",5,2015,02,17
28,Excellent!!,"Excellent hotel, excellent service/staff and stunning views over Barcelona. 
The check in was fast, with personal attention of the staff. The quality of the food was really good. I loved the room; we took one with spectacular views over Barcelona....amazing.....so highly recommended. Cant wait to return with my family!!",5,2015,02,01
28,4 th visit in a year,"This is our 4 th visit in 12 months, the rooms are good, our son likes the Bauhaus inspired suite (602 or 603 I think from memory) my wife and I prefer 203 with the hot tub on the tTerrace.

Staff are great and very efficient , and smartly turned out. Breakfast is ok, but I still can't work out why you make about 60 eggs scrambled and leave then in a chaffing dish, for a few hours, it's so wrong, tip for the F & B manager . Eggs to order please, I am sure you would use less eggs , push that GP% up a bit !
Much smaller tapa menu in the winter months, but you would expect that I guess. 
The Concierge staff are very good. The hotel is out of town, but great views of the city and be sure to book you courtesy bus into town well in advance !

Having griped about the eggs and the minibus, we would return here time and time again, it's hard to put your finger on it, but we just love the hotel and staff.",5,2015,01,28
28,Great views!!,"I loved the room; we took one with spectacular views to the city, on the corner, one of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in.
I also loved the decoration, and the bathroom, all marbled, very stylish, and very nice. 
All together, very comfortable.

However, when we arrived, the shower lights did not work; neither the heating in the bathroom, and it was quite cold. 
I think a luxury 5 stars hotel should check all rooms before guests arrive so that these things should not happen. 
Moreover, service during breakfast was quite disappointing. They were not very helpful, always doing something or talking, so you nearly had to beg for a coffee!!!",4,2015,01,20
28,A Jewel outside the beautiful Barcelona,"We spent a amazing Christmas Day here and it was recommended by friends in London - this hotel has stunning views and we had a lovely walk up to the church which was so beautiful and we went on another walk when it was dark - more spectacular .This Hotel is a place of peace, tranquility and magic. The staff make you feel so special and we loved our Christmas dinner - salmon was delicious - thank you Emily and your wonderful staff for their attention and kindness. We felt breakfast was ok - we thought it could have been so much better.
Our room was a big amazing and the views were breathtaking. We loved our room and we will come back here again for sure - worth every euro but we will stay longer next time. Thank you to all the staff - you made our stay MAGIC. Mary & Joseph",5,2015,01,14
28,Stunning. Breathtaking. Magic.,"Stunning place. Breathtaking wiev over the city and the sea. Magic stay. Great rooms, totally extraordinary view from our terrace. Quality meals, great pool and jacuzzi. Staying there was worth every euro spent on it. If asked whether you want to go there - always say yes!  :)",5,2015,01,08
28,returning customers and it was the same excellent stay,"We stayed over Christmas and chose this hotel because of prior experience and again it was fabulous.  it is highly recommended despite that it takes a lot of money and time to commute between the hotel and the city centre, but it is worth it!

We often had dinner in the hotel and it was good. The only thing they need to improve is really coffee and deserts ( not fantastic)!

The rest really depends on what you need and everything could be done in this hotel just ask!",5,2015,01,07
28,New Year break,"Stunning views over Barcelona.  About 20 mins drive to the centre of the Barcelona - there is a bus stop right outside the hotel which is useful to know. 

The pool and jacuzzi are great. Breakfast is ok - not outstanding. 

Rooms are excellent but could do with a coffee machine at the rates that are charged. 

Overall we had a very relaxing and pleasant stay.",4,2015,01,01
28,The only way to 'see' Barcelona!,"So, I conducted my usual search on Trip Advisor for the heads up on this hotel. To be fair, most were pretty spot on.
I'll start at our check in. We were greeted with a glass of iced water, nice touch, on check in. Reception said he would check to see if our room was ready, I wasn't surprised as this information was clearly stated in the booking confirmation. We were led to the terrace bar where we were offered a complimentary drink. I asked for a beer, my wife a vodka tonic. We were a little surprised to note that we were then charged for the vodka. On questioning we were told that only the mixer and beer were gratis....? So be careful what you ask for, as you may get more than you bargained, and budgeted for!
Anyway, this was a slight aside as what did greet us at the terrace was the most incredible view of Barcelona....you can litterally see the whole of Barcelona from this location, it truely is an amazing sight, so wonderfully pleasing for the eyes!
In less that 15 minutes we were told our room was ready and that our luggage had been taken to the room. We were escorted to our room and home for the next 4 nights, and on opening the front door the same amazing view was right in front of us, right through the terrace double doors. We had room 104, a large, light airy room with a large terrace with table and chairs and two lounge beds for relaxing. It really was a little too cold for us to sit out there whilst we were there, but never the less, it was a lovely space.
We had complimentary water in our room, nice smellies in the bathroom, huge shower room! So all in all a very nice place to lay our head.
The Spa was very good with two exceptions which I'll come to. The positives are: The pool is lovely, 24 degrees, very clean and had an indoor and outdoor part as it also runs along the terrace bar outside, but as mentioend earlier, it was a little brisk to swim out there. The jacuzzi was a nice big size, the steam room was, well, a steam room. There are a few loungers, however, if it's busy, you may have to wait for one. We spent two days in the spa area just chilling the day away, so it was very nice! 
The negative are: On one of the days we had to go hunting for fresh large towels as they were all out, dirty ones were left strewn over the lounge beds. Only small hand towels were available. On asking one of the members of staff for clean towels, rather than go looking she just started to fold some small towels and lay them out instead. We asked again, she said she would go looking, then continued to fold the towels...it was a little weird. It took a third attempt to prompt her to physically go and get fresh towels....eventually, they arrived. Another negative is to do with the jacuzzi. Unfortunately there is no childs pool in the spa, so some families were using the jacuzzi as a creche, somewhere for their ankle biters to learn to swim, or splash and play about...not good, not good at all and not condusive to relaxing, we retired to the steam room!
We had our first meal in the main restaurant L’Orangerie restaurant. Three courses and wine, now here's the rub. It is good food, very good, but you do pay for it, it's very expensive. something we were willing to do just on one night...and it was worth it. For the next few nights we were in Bacelona City sampling some of the best Tapas! Do get yourself down to the centre. It's so easy to do. Just walk to the bus stop outside, it's about 3 euros straight run into the centre, or, simply walk up the hill around the back of the hotel. Take in the sights of the cathedral at the top, breathe in the amazing view that is located at the front of a rather dated, well stuck in the past, amusement park. Then, get on the funicular located in the amusement park....it takes you down the hill to the underground. It's all signposted, you can't get lost. A return trip only costs about 6 euro. We made it part of the day, it's well worth doing, otherwise you can get a taxi at around 25 euro each way. I know what I'd prefer. 
I'd definitely go back to this hotel....you get the best of both worlds...relaxing, clean air, then the hustle and culture of the city.",4,2014,12,19
28,VIP treatment and great amenities,"I stayed there for a relaxing weekend with my girlfriend and it was amazing! The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. Great pool, jacuzzi and sauna! And even the background music was very well selected. We really felt like we were being taken care of. The spa is fantastic! The room was big, very clean, comfortable and quiet. Also the view of Barcelona is breathtaking! We are definitely coming back there next time stress strikes!",5,2014,12,17
28,"Excellent hotel, but location is really specific","The hotel surprised us. During 3 days the hotel was really caring about us: from check-in until last good-buy when the door of taxi closed. Comfortable room, big bath, nice breakfast, big swimming pool, spa... The concierge Victoria gave us perfect advices about restaurants, no touristic traps but the very opposite. Well, the ladies on the reception are very friendly and helpful. Really, many positive things inside the hotel protected us from the rainy weather outside. But everything has its price, everyday return taxi trip to Barcelona would cost you from 30 to 60 euro depending how much taxi driver would have cheated you. So when you see the rate, do not forget to add the transportation to the city. Finally, we had no regret that we stayed this time outside Barcelona. Indeed.",5,2014,12,12
28,Barcelona from atop the hill!,"Extremely well appointed, clean, and nice.  I attended a business trip, but wish I had shared this hotel with my wife.  Excellent views of the city, only downside with the 15 minute trip down the hill. High recommended.",5,2014,12,02
28,Panoramic views of Barcelona,"This is a perfect hotel for those who want to visit Barcelona and want a relaxing holiday at the same time. Situated high above the city on Mount Tibidabo, the hotel has panoramic views of the entire city. Our room was clean, bright and spacious with views of the mountains to the north west, the bed was very comfortable. We went in December so the hotel was perfectly quiet. It seemed like we were the only guests at times and had the spa to ourselves for a couple of hours. Great breakfast buffet and cocktail bar. Didn't get an opportunity to try the restaurant in the evening but I heard the food was great from other guests. The staff were extremely helpful. Close to the hotel you will find a mono rail that will take you to the city and a quant theme park. A Great hotel overall and can't wait to return.",5,2014,11,30
28,Feel on top of the world,"Spectacular hotel, not just in terms of the view from 500m above Barcelona but also the ambience, service, decor and facilities provided by the hotel and all it's wonderfully friendly and helpful staff.
Probably the most unique hotel in this wonderful city in terms of it's history,location and spectacular outlook from many of it's rooms, terraces, and pool.
Reasonably easy to explore the city, descending by hotel shuttle bus, public bus services, funicular or taxi but some times vary depending on time of year and/or day of week. Unless returning very early options are likely to involve a taxi for the final ascent even if taking public transport for part of the journey or just take one of the easily available taxi's all the way after a exploring the city and all it's wonderful attractions by day or night.
Visited mid to late November, warm enough to swim both indoors and outside, gazing across the city from the infinity pool and the terraces.
Lionel Messi broke the all time Barcelona and La Liga's goal scoring records with yet another hat trick but staying at La Gran Hotel La Florida made us all feel on top of the world!",5,2014,11,24
28,Spectacular!,"Brilliant stay in this hotel. The rooms are great, the view incredible and the staff are exceptional. The food was to a very high standard. The spa is well equipped and made for an extremely relaxing stay. ",5,2014,11,04
28,A retreat above Barcelona,"Grand Hotel La Florida was our forth hotel in a almost two week stay in Barcelona. We decided to experience Barcelona by staying in different neighborhoods within the city. It was our 35 th wedding anniversary where we renewed our vows privately. 

We started at the Barcelona Arts Hotel ,a modern gem, on the beach overlooking a Frank Gehry sculpture of an abstract fish. We had a perfect stay where we were sent a lovely Cava wine upon our arrival to congratulate us .The staff were young enthusiast  trainees from all over the world who all made us feel amazing welcome. The hotel was filled with sophisicated art.The food was.very good.and hotel incredibly clean. We were given beautiful suite overlooking the sea.lovely gardens , flowers and a lovely pool were extra added assets.

After being spoiled there we went to the The Palace Hotel. We again were given a great room  and bottle of.Cava..It.is a.truly beautiful hotel,abeautiful entry, just gorgeous.The restaurant was fabulous.We new this would be a very different old world experience and we wanted to be pampered. It was in a neighborhood near some of the Gaudi masterpieces like Casa Mila. Perfect from the moment we arrived until our parting..food, staff and room.

We then left and went to Casa Fuster. Perfect in every way. To us a real wow! :-)
 We have traveled extensively and have  just started posting on trip advisor. Here we were swept if our feet!! It  is so charming and it was great to enjoy the Thursday night jazz trio there. We were so lucky to be upgraded to a spectacular suite. It was even equipped with a sauna.The architecture was amazing.I lovely spending time on our balcony.

So we are demanding travelersand appreciate beauty and courtesy.

We were so excited to go up the hill for a weekend to relax after all our touring.
To our disappointment and the only time it happened anytime during our trip we were greeted less then enthusically by the front desk. We waited which was not a problem but were sneered at when the person checking us in looked at our bags. (We had enjoyed shopping in your country.)The bellman was wonderful, no complaints the greatest guy.. We are members if LHW and asked if any upgrades were possible and we got a cool no from the front desk. That was ok since it was a wedding weekend .We understood. The problem was neither resturant could take us for dinner and we had hoped to enjoy the hotel. We had to leave and find a resturant all the way down the hill in Barcelona. Very disappointing.The pool area was very nice as was the view. So I think if the restaurant accommodated us and the frpnt desk had been warmer we might have been very happy.So the pool was the best asset  besides their amazing friendly and helpful driver .However after being so well catered to by all three other hotels in Barcelona this hotel was last of the four on our list.",4,2014,10,30
28,Just perfect!,"My husband and I have recently returned from a trip to Barcelona to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary.  We chose the Florida for our first night (Saturday 18th). We've been to Barcelona many times so we weren't looking for a hotel close to the hustle and bustle, we were looking for something special.

As soon as we arrived we knew we'd made the right choice.  Such a friendly yet professional welcome from Paloma at check-in.  Every time we saw her she was smiling and seemed genuinely pleased to see us.

The room (a corner suite) was beautiful - sitting on the balcony was a delight. The views really were amazing both day and night.  The hotel's outdoor terraces were gorgeous. The restaurant was superb. Breakfast was lovely sitting outside looking out to that view. The staff were amazing - they all called us by our names.  We felt very special.  So different from just being a 'room number' in a bigger hotel.

There were so many special touches that made our stay perfect.

We will never forget our stay here.  If you're looking for a beautiful hotel with great staff and gorgeous rooms and views then stay here.  It really is perfect.

We left the Florida to stay at the Arts Hotel which is another fabulous hotel but given the choice I would have rather stayed the extra night at the Florida.  We were very sad to leave.

Thank you to Paloma and the team.  We will most definitely be back.

The Sandersons",5,2014,10,28
28,Great hotel a bit of a trek to city centre,"The hotel was idyllic with fantastic views. The welcome was warm and professional. Our room 117 had a balcony which overlooked the city and sea on one side and the mountains on the other - both views were beautiful. The room was large with a great shower. The hotel had a wonderful swimming pool which wrapped around the bar with part indoors and part outdoors. The outdoor section had great views over Barcelona - we were able to sit in the pool and take-in the views. The bar food was good if a little expensive. We did eat in the restaurant which was closed on Sunday and Monday, unusual for a 5 star hotel we felt. The restaurant seemed to take itself a bit too seriously with a desert being called a walk on Tibidabo. When asked what it was the waiter told us the Chef wanted us to experience the desert - no details were forthcoming. Get a grip! The restaurant was expensive too. The hotel is located high on a mountain (Tibidabo). This is both a virtue and a curse. On the one hand the location gives majestic views - on the other the location means the journey into the city centre is either lengthy or very expensive (approx 40 euro). However, we purchased a Barcelona Card via the internet before we left London which gave us public transport for 5 days for approx. £57. This enabled us to use the bus No.111, the funicular railway and the metro system to get to Central Barcelona. We really enjoyed the journey - it took about 40 minutes. Overall we loved our stay at the hotel and Barcelona.",4,2014,10,21
28,Amazing views!,"We recently had a short visit to this wonderful hotel. We enjoyed a very nice meal with our party of 8 out on the patio overlooking the city of Barcelona. The beautiful pool with a waterfall edge was lovely to look at as well.
Staff were very good and we were offered a glass of champagne on arrival which was appreciated!
Our room was very nice with excellent views as well. This is a beautiful hotel and I only wish we had more time to use the spa and take in the views during the day.
It is about a 20-45 minute drive from the airport depending on traffic and I believe they offer shuttles to the downtown area. It really is a hotel that is beautiful for it's views and the property. If sightseeing like Las Ramblas are on your agenda then perhaps a different hotel within walking distance of sightseeing would be a better choice, but for a one of a kind beautiful place it is worth some time!",5,2014,10,16
28,Very nice retreat,"The hotel looks majestic on top of the Tibidabo, and feels like it too. Suite 901 has splendid view over the city, which you can take a look while relaxing in a whirlpool. Terrace of the room is huge. Pool on the first level is one of the best I have ever seen in a hotel – infinity, L-shaped, and at least 50 meters long. Service is good, although not 5 star. City is easily reachable by the funicular, or taxi. If you've been in Barcelona before, I strongly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,10,11
28,Perfect for our needs,"We chose to stay at the Gran Florida for our first 3 nights in Barcelona because it seemed the perfect spot to slowly acclimate into the Barcelona experience and relax after our flight from the states.
It was just as we had hoped!
We enjoyed the room, serves, facilities and access to Barcelona, only 20 minutes via taxi, which was easily arranged.
Beautiful spot overlooking the city and an excellent experience.",5,2014,10,07
28,A Leading Bad Hotel,"Let me start by stating that I have stayed in many leading hotels of the world and have never been disappointed.  That can not be said for my stay at Gran Hotel La Florida.   The disappointment started at check in.  We were coming in from Boston so we landed in the morning.  Unfortunately, we were not given our room until 4pm in the afternoon.  The front desk manager was not helpful in getting us settled early.  We got the sense that she didn't really care that we had arrived early. I think she needs some training in catering to clients needs.  We finally make it to our room only to wait another 30 minutes for our baggage to follow us.  The week was pretty much more of the same as far as service.  Also, a word of caution, for those traveling after September, getting to and from the city is a nightmare.  The hotel has a shuttle that only fits 6 people so plan on taking taxis since it was fully booked during our stay.",2,2014,10,06
28,Fabulous stay,"We stayed 1 night, a present from our daughter who lives in Barcelona. We have often said we would like to go and we were not disappointed. The afternoon began with Cava on the terrace which overlooks the city and sea in the distance. Our room was large with a super size bed - only to be beaten in size  by one in the Venetian, Las Vegas. It had 2 balconies with floor to ceiling doors with views of the coast and mountains as well as the city and sea. The bathroom was  well furbished and we appreciated the ""art deco "" touches.
We swam and used the jacuzzi and sauna but were a little confused as to "" his "" and "" hers "" or were they communal? Not a problem to us! 
We were aware that the restaurant was expensive as it happened it was closed when we were there so we ate in the terrace/bar restaurant. My husband had the "" best steak ever "" I had salmon which was cooked to perfection. We would certainly recommend and we hope to return sometime in the future.",5,2014,10,06
28,High above it all,"Dear Traveler,

My loved one and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Barcelona, Spain.  Our first visit to this beautiful city by the sea.   We stayed in a Chateau style hotel that sits high above the city of Barcelona with breathe taking panoramic views.   The hotel is surrounded by lush landscaping.  This is truly a jewel of a hotel that is so tastefully decorated and where well- healed, seasoned travelers and locals spend their time relaxing from the hustle and bustle of the city center.

We were fortunate enough to stay in the Presidential Suite, which I highly recommend.    Approximately 2000 square feet of pure luxury.  Modern yet rustic.  Massive palladium windows that opened and offered  beautiful breezes and vistas of the entire city.

The hotels Staff is extremely kind, willing and able to do their best in assisting in any of your needs.  One person,  I must absolutely shout out to is Victoria Amoros in charge of guest relations.  She  greeted us upon our arrival and made sure every detail from dinner reservation at the finest restaurants and knowledgeable private tours were secured for our 4 night visit in this lovely city.

My one point, I would like to make if you are seeking pure relaxation this is your hotel!    Keep in mind it is a 20 min travel time via taxi to and from the city center and an average round trip cost 60- 80 euros.  

As well-seasoned travelers,  it is an experience, especially for couples one should not miss.

Safe Travels,

28,Historic HOTEL WITH A PANORAMIC VIEW OF BARCELONA,"This fantastic Hotel atop Tibidabo and surrounded by lush woodland but its a 20 minute ride to the city so for a long stay I would not recommend it.Historically its worth investigating since movie stars and dignitaries were very fond of it since its construction in the early 1900.Restaurant is closed on Sundays.Its a solid structure with marble and wood plus stone but the pool is super contemporary.My room had a balcony overlooking Barcelona in the distance.Everything was very clean and the bathroom well equipped including tub,shower and bidet.The terrace restaurant is a great place top have the breakfast buffet.The bus service, if you don't care for a cab, will take you to Plaza Catalunya at the heart of Barcelona.You can also book a free hotel shuttle.The old pictures of the hotel in sepia are worth studying.There is a vey relaxing atmosphere.",5,2014,09,22
28,A Weekend Hotel,"The hotel is located in a lovely area, as many previous reviewers have mentioned the views are breathtaking. We arrived late at the hotel due to weather issues. The check in was good, and they greeted us with a glass of Cava. The inside of the hotel is sophisticated, and modern. The simple furnishings and lovely wood makes the place look clean, and spacious. When we checked in the gentlemen explained how the breakfast buffet worked, and also mentioned the hotel and terrace restaurant. The room was nice and we had a small balcony with great views. I will say that the bathroom was large and clean, but I did not think that the bed was very comfortable. Also, just be aware that there is a amusement park right next to the hotel, and during the day and into the evening it can be loud. Also, be aware that you are a good cab ride away from Barcelona. Now that is not a big deal if you are only there a couple of days...but I would not recommend this hotel if you plan on spending a long time in Barcelona, and need to go back and forth into the city as it will become a bit expensive. Since we where so far from the city we took advantage of the buffet on the first morning. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, and paid high prices for a buffet (to be expected) but, I felt the selection was just average. You can get the staff to make you your breakfast which I would recommend. One of the biggest disappointments we had, was that we had planned on eating at the resturant on Sunday evening, and when we went to get reservations, we where told it is closed on Sunday's! Now that is fine, but you should tell your guest when checking in that the restaurant will not be open. Instead we ended up eating at the terrace, which was fine, just not what we had planned. Overall the place is lovely, with wonderful views, but you need to be sure you are prepared for a long cab drive to Barcelona, and to pay higher prices due to your location. We had a lovely time and would recommend this place if you find yourself in the beautiful city of Barcelona. ",4,2014,09,12
28,"Lovely hotel, panoramic views, fantastic staff...","The Gran Hotel La Florida is a sturdily structured block of a building sitting squarely atop mount Tibidabo, which provides a forested backdrop to the wonderful city of Barcelona. The building's quiet solidity and symmetry is attractive, and it is set in a minimal acreage of well-kept terracing which offers unbeatable views over the city to the sea. At night, the view across the lighted city is magical.
 
Inside, its pared-back simplicity of styling is cool and relaxing. Nothing overwhelming. Natural materials, stone, marble and wood are used throughout, and furnishings are kept to a minimum to maximise the feeling of space. 

My husband and I stayed for five nights in a Deluxe room on the second floor. No balcony, but the gorgeous floor to ceiling, dual aspect arched windows offered beautiful views to wake up to each morning. There were some slight signs of wear and tear here and there which, in an establishment that would consider itself five star, do need to be addressed, but overall this did not detract from our enjoyment of our accommodation. 

The bed was king-sized and very comfortable. I loved the wood flooring - a lovely rich, polished  colour - smooth and warm underfoot.  
The en-suite bathroom was well-equiped with bath and separate, spacious shower. Everything was kept spotlessly clean - so important! 

There is a fridge in the room containing some drinks and snacks for which prices are, as is usually the case in these establishments, rather silly. And being British, I really did miss tea and coffee-making facilities in the room. But again, that's just a minor, personal gripe. 

Breakfasts were well provided for with a reasonable Smorgasbord of cheeses, meats, fruits, breads and pastries. There is also a selection of hot dishes such as bacon, eggs and stuffed tomatoes. The kitchen staff will cook your eggs for you any which way you prefer. 
We ate an evening meal in the terrace restaurant on two occasions. On both, the food was delicious. Prices though - a tad ludicrous - but still works out more cheaply than doing a return taxi trip into Barcelona. 

We enjoyed relaxing on the comfy seating by the pool in the terrace bar area, reading and looking up once in a while to enjoy the view. After a long day in the city with all its excitement, heat and non-stop noise, the hotel was a wonderful haven of peace to come back to.

There is a great bus service just a few metres from the hotel, which runs into Placa Catalunya - one stop - which costs less than 3 euros/person. But it doesn't run every day, notably not on Mondays or Tuesdays. So if you happen to be staying on these days it would be worth booking the free hotel shuttle in advance to take you into the city. Taxis are very expensive and actually cost 25 - 30 euros a go - so you probably really wouldn't want to be using these too often, unless money is no object! 
It might also be worth checking out the funicular and tram services that run between the city and the theme park on Tibidabo as an alternate means of transport. Or, of-course, you could hire your own car.

The staff at the hotel are wonderful. Really helpful, friendly but not intrusive - they have the balance just right, and this is everyone. I can't praise the reception staff enough; when our airport transfer failed to arrive, they painstakingly rang the company - three times - to sort things out. Just great! The restaurant and bar staff - so efficient and the chamber staff - you would hardly know they were there and they did a grand job of up-keep. And the shuttle driver - my husband commented ""...bought four different city guides with maps and we get all the info we actually need, with map, from the driver..."" Enough said!

In all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Would we go back? Most definitely!",4,2014,09,11
28,Almost perfect,"Fortunate to be upgraded to roof top suite with incredible panoramic views of Barcelona on one side and lush mountainous woodland on the other  Check in was smooth and efficient, with a glass of Cava.  Service by all staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive in any way - a tough ballance to strike.  Breakfast was possibly one of the best hotel breakfasts that I have ever been served.

Only negatives for me were that the pool area was not tidied of used towels in the early evening, which made it look quite untidy.  There seemed to just be beginning signs that the hotel probably needed a little TLC.",4,2014,09,08
28,Horrid welcome,"Here's it the letter I just sent to the hotel manager :
To the attention of Cristina Roures,
Madam, 
Tonight my husband and myself had decided to dine in your restaurant. Upon arriving, the valet parking asked us if we had a reservation. As we didn't, he told us he couldn't park my small car and that I should park it MYSELF down the road.
After such unfriendly  welcome, we left and I am not sure we will ever feel like visiting your hotel again. We are used to staying in 5 star hotels and it's really the first time such a problem occurs, if the car park is full, I reckon it's not the client's problem and it's your duty to find a solution .
Regards

So, if you plan to visit this hotel, which by the way is very nice, beware of the valet and the very poor welcome he might give you !",1,2014,09,06
28,A truly breathtaking and unimaginably spectacular hotel!!!,"There almost aren't enough words to describe the magnificence of this hotel. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world and very few, if any, have taken my breath away like this one has. This is the only hotel at the very top of the mountain overlooking all of Barcelona. It's a sophisticated, chic and sexy hotel. The stylish design and decor of the rooms and facilities dovetail perfectly with an absolutely incredible infinity pool that seems to flow right into Barcelona itself. The modern and modish design is further complimented with great service and staff as well as a wonderful, world-class breakfast buffet and food. All of this only to be trumped by its dazzling and exhilarating view of all of Barcelona. We had a corner room with two balconies and the view was idyllic, intense and incredibly breathtaking. For anyone who is looking for an extraordinary stay with unfathomable views and experience  ... this is the place for you. Truly one of the best in the world!",5,2014,08,28
28,"Pet friendly no, stealing friendly!","They charged me 50 EUROS PER DAY for letting my little pet sleep in my room!!! This is stealing!!! At the end of the week paying 400 euros only because we're animal lovers is simply hilarious!!! 
Swimming pool closes early too!!!
The lunch was pretty awful...",1,2014,08,28
28,Amazing Place,"five star hotel  on top of the mountain looking down over Barcelona, with great views, a fantastic infinity pool and spa area, the staff are welcoming and friendly rooms are of a good quality,

the food and service is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel  
there is an amusement park nearby for adults and kids (not noisy)

only downside its a good 20 minutes out of Barca by cab",5,2014,08,27
28,Old-fashioned hotel,"I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a long stay, it's old-fashioned and too expensive considering what they offer. 

While on their pool, you'll be accompanied by the screams of the people of the amusement park they have as their neighbours.
Food was good, but too expensive considering the quality. Waiters are all from south-america and barely speak English, it seems they don't get paid well (that's what one of the waiters told us) so no wonder they are so badly trained. They were slow when serving at the restaurant.  When trying to enjoy a drink at their terrace, and they had to ask us how to make a bellini since they didn't know what was it. 

They pretend to be posh but you can totally tell it's been stuck in the 80's and their staff is not well trained. 

The woman at the front desk was absolutely rude, since we had to wait for her to hang up the phone when we were trying to ask for something (she was making a personal phone call considering what she was talking about). 

It's just an average hotel with the price of a luxury one.",2,2014,08,14
28,"Wonderful room, lovely views, fantastic stay!","We had a wonderful time at this hotel and would definitely visit again, in fact, we just didn't want to leave and tried to postpone our flight home!  The hotel was stunning and when we arrived, after a long day of sightseeing, we were greeted by a glass of bubbly and a tour of the hotel. When we entered our room, we found our bags neatly stacked and ready for us to unpack, lovely classical music playing and perfect lighting. The room exceeded our expectations and blew us away, as it was spotlessly clean and tidy, beautifully decorated and luxurious, with some of the best views that we have ever had the pleasure of seeing upon waking (plus, one of the largest and comfiest beds that we've ever slept in). A high spec TV, with brilliant connectivity and fast Wi-Fi was an added bonus, although we barely turned it on, favouring sitting on the balcony and taking in the wonderful view.
Each and every member of staff was professional and friendly, especially the shuttle bus driver, Abel, who was absolutely lovely, helpful and very informative.  We used the hotel shuttle on 2 occasions, but I would recommend that you call early, as we found that even if we called the day before, the shuttle spaces had already been filled. This was a shame and a little frustrating but we did not find it too restrictive, as there is a bus which stops 50 yards from the hotel, taking you straight down to the centre for under €3 per person, per trip.  The bus runs around every 15 minutes and the last bus is quite late in the summer, as it services the Tibidabo Amusement park at the top of the mountain. We didn't need to get a taxi but had been informed that it was around €20 each way and so the bus was a nice money saver. 
We found the drinks in the hotel to be reasonably high priced, as would be expected and we did not mind paying a premium for a drink but we were disappointed that there was no reasonably priced option for lunch and what we did eat at the pool bar, did not warrant the price tag of €18 for a sandwich and chips.  We decided not to opt for breakfast, as this was a cost of €28 per person, per day and just did not appear to be worth it.  Instead, we chose to eat in town or at the little café, near the amusement park entrance.  However, we did not eat in the Orangery and so cannot comment on the tasting menu, which did look lovely. Unfortunately, being 4 months pregnant is fairly restrictive when eating out and there was too much that I would not have been able to enjoy, otherwise we would have treated ourselves one evening. 
Please do visit the wonderful church, as it was spectacular and the views from the top, breath-taking. It is less than ten minutes walk and there are some lovely views on the way.
We loved our stay and it was even more important that it be extra special, as we are looking forward to becoming parents in December and so it was one of the last trips that we will take alone, before our new arrival!  We stayed a total of 3 nights at the Florida and 2 nights in a central hotel and it was nice to experience the contrasting locations.",4,2014,08,14
28,Hotel with a view,"Fabulous hotel. Wonderful staff and everyone of them cares about your stay. Cannot be too helpful. Had a family room with terrace. Great room but 2 children on sofa bed not really what I expected from a hotel of this standard. 
Other than that no complaints with the room. 
Pool wonderful and open until 10 each night. Great place to wind down after a hard days adventure in the city.
Food good but a little over priced with a limited menu especially on the tapas front. 
The hotel offer a shuttle service to the city and back. I suggest booking upon arrival. The bus only has 6 seats so it's full almost as you check in. From city back up last bus is 16.30. Far too early to enjoy the city. If you are bold enough to use the public transport network it is great. We booked a 3 day metro for all zones. Worked on local blue (111) and funicular. Get metro straight from city, links to funicular then step out onto the 111. Same going in. Around 45 mins each way. There are taxis but this will add up if going in and out.
Theme park shut on Monday and Tuesday so the parks funicular and blue bus is not working on these days. Great restaurant with wonderful views at base of parks funicular.
In short a great place to stay. Very relaxed and quiet especially when park is shut.",4,2014,08,12
28,Fantastic,"We spent 3 Nights 4 days at 
"" La Florida "" and we were very impressed with the service and the cleanliness. 
All the staff are helpful and attentive.
We definitely recommend the hotel if you want a break away, peace and quiet and to be made to feel like royalty...👍",4,2014,08,08
28,B E A utiful !!',"I booked a 4 night stay as a suprise for my wife on our 10th wedding anniversary, it was me who got the suprise when we arrived to the most fantastic hotel and staff!

The location give the most amazing view over the city of Barcelona I would highly recommend booking a sea view.

There is a local bus stop right outside the hotel and costs less than 3 Euros per person, which drives directly to the centre.

The staff were exceptional all very happy and made us feel so welcome, I cannot thank everyone enough for making our 10th wedding anniversary so perfect I hope to visit again in the near future.

Thank you !!!!!",5,2014,07,25
28,15 July Trip,"Excellent standard of hotel and staff but look a bit closer at the finishes in the rooms and you will then see they need some tlc - head boards damaged, mini bar chipped, bathroom door missing!

Location - get the bus T2A into the city but make sure you know what time they run late...usually last bus is around 9pm but this changes.

Taxis - about 20 euros back to hotel but every time we used one they got lost...make sure they definitely know where the hotel is before they start driving!!!!

Sun loungers.....good luck with getting one! The Germans had their towels out every day and the Hotel should stop this! 

Food and drink at the pool side bar....very expensive!!",4,2014,07,24
28,"Wonderful few days, the positives far outweigh the negatives, here's a summary of both","We stayed at this hotel from Sunday to Wednesday, it was wonderful! Here's a summary of the positives and negatives.

Positives:
- service was outstanding (a little slow sometimes, but friendliness and attitude more than made up for this)
- room quality was excellent, we had a city facing room and the view was as good as it sounds, also the bathroom was exceptional - I want to replicate this in my own house
- food was delicious throughout (there are two restaurants, a poolside restaurant/cafe/bar and a fine dining restaurant, both were exceptional)
- ambience throughout the hotel was highly relaxing, luxurious, and comfortable
- the views are breathtaking!

Negatives:
- the cost of food at the poolside cafe/bar is a little high, however the quality of the food and the atmosphere both make it worth the cost
- the journey to the center of Barcelona is a little far, however this was completely fine for us as we only went into Barcelona twice (one night for dinner and drinks, and then the next day to the beach and for lunch - both times we caught public transport there and then a taxi back), the rest of the time we were perfectly content sitting by the pool in the hotel - and for only two visits it's really not too far at all

Overall it was a wonderful experience, highly recommended!",5,2014,07,24
28,A hotel with a view,The location is great but management should make some adjustments to match the service with the view. It is far from city centre and better arrangements are to be made to satisfy all their guests. All guests pay for five star service  . The views are great and the spa is good. All ground floor staff are friendly and helpful.. The pool is great and a room on the corners have two balconies which is great.,3,2014,07,23
28,Fantastic find. Will return,"The hotel is situated at the very top of a hill and over looks the whole of Barcelona. Absolutely stunning views from the terrace/pool area. 
Greeted on arrival with a glass of cava each and bags taken to our room. Check in was very professional, efficient and fast. We arrived 4 hours early for check in and our room was ready and waiting which was great. 
Pool and decking area for sunbathing is fantastic with plenty of loungers - even when it got busy on the weekend. 
Beautiful L'Occitane spa with fantastic and attentive staff. Loved the treatments and they are about the same price as what you would pay here in a decent spa. 
Highly recommend the Almond body wrap!
Rooms are spacious with a huge bathroom. Lovely Superking size bed and all very clean and fresh. 
We didn't eat at the hotel apart from for breakfast but an ok variety - continental and them the standards bacon, eggs, sausages and waffles/pancakes. 
Food is very expensive at the hotel as are drinks - hence why we ate out in the evening. 
There is a fee shuttle which takes you into the icy centre at 10am, 12.30pm and then 4pm. It picks up from Barcelona 30 mins after the above times. 
So for the evening you need to either take the bus down the hill (T2A) which is €2.95 one way or a can which will be about $15/20. BEWARE the taxi metre will start as soon as it pulls into the hotel so do. Or keep it waiting as we once paid €10 extra for a 4 minute wait. 
Taxi cost from airport to the hotel was only €28 on the way there but for some reason cost us €49 on the return journey!! 
High highly recommend the Tapas restaurant Cervecería Catalana. They do not take reservations and if you arrive after 8.30/9pm expect at least an hour wait for a table. Well worth it though. We had 2 litres of sangria, 12 dishes and 1 pudding for €56. 
Would definitely return to this hotel without a doubt. ",5,2014,07,21
28,Privilege in staying in this captivating abode  outweighs other considerations.,"In the hills of Collserole,sits this epicurean's choice with breathtaking views over Barcelona and the Mediterranean sea,thanks to its 512m elevation. It sits in a privilaged position dominating the city. In an incomparable setting,imbued with history,lux,art and design... your choice is easy and your heart soars.
       Short visits without a car are the go. eating at the abode is simple. Book a time for dinner at the Orangerie restaurant and swoon at the sheer magic created here.The pool is great with every creature comfort catered to. Free shuttle twice a day motivates you to lift your body from poolside.
      Super,super repose,quiet nights and blissful sleep.

28,"Hidden treasure of serenity, stunning views and gracious staff.",What a surprise!  I booked through an offer of 4 nights with 5th night free through hotels.com.  Even with that offer it was in the higher range of my price point but I was intrigued by the reviews which were quite positive and gave the hotel 5 stars.  I wholeheartedly concur! We arrived after a 12 day cruise with a particularly exhausting itinerary.  We wanted to wind down and are now so unwound that even packing for our trip home seems intrusive.  We thoroughly enjoyed the location--even the amusement park next door seemed charming-- booking the shuttle into the city center was simple and both prompt and personal.  Everyone took pains to answer our every request with enthusiasm.  We will be sad to depart.  Thank you La Florida!,5,2014,07,15
28,Didn't quite deliver,"The hotel is gorgeous and the views were breathtaking. We went for a larger room with city view which was really lovely.
However, the food at the pool bar & cafe let it down as it is quite pricey without really giving you that extra quality you would hope for. On the flip side, the orangerie restaurant for the evening meal was fabulous with great staff, beautiful wine and excellent service. Xenia their sommelier was very knowledgable and approachable and made each evening we spent there a delight.
The other downside to the hotel was the transport. There is a shuttle bus advertised on their website but when we were there it had ""an issue"". Meaning our only option was to drive ourselves into Barcelona or take a taxi. It was no great hardship but you feel a hotel of its standing would have made an effort to meet its commitments rather than just leaving us to our own devices after letting us book onto the shuttle and make plans. 

If you are looking for a retreat for one night to visit their restaurant - this is perfect. If you are staying longer you may find yourself captive on the mountain with a poor choice & quality of lunch or making your our adventure into Barcelona.",3,2014,07,13
28,A beautiful hotel with outstanding views,"When we pulled up at the hotel I couldn't believe my eyes. The views were amazing-mountains one side and the whole city from the other. Our room had been upgraded to the junior suite which was beautiful. Bed was extremely comfy, two balconys and luxurious bathroom. We only ate lunch In the hotel once as we were busy exploring the city, but the food was lovely. Had a couple of treatments in the spa, which were also great and not too overpriced. Great service from the staff. Free shuttle into town twice a day. Have never felts as special as I did when I stayed in la Florida!",5,2014,07,11
28,Luxury. Understated elegance. ,High atop a hill overlooking the vast city of Barcelona is a true gem. The staff is well educated and accommodating. The rooms are the perfect blend of old school elegance and modern touches. The infinity pool is fab. The staff will ride you into town and it's nice to get away from the bustle of Barcelona. ,5,2014,07,09
28,Epic views and luxury.,"The Gran Hotel La Florida is a luxurious hotel with spectacular views of Barcelona, the sea and the hills in the other direction.  It was an incredible mix of old world graciousness and modern decor touches.  Our corner room had two balconies and walls of windows.  It was spectacular.  It is a bit of a drive (20 min) to the center of Barcelona city, but we were grateful for the distance from the chaos of the city.  We drove in without any problem.  The pool is gorgeous, allowing you to swim from inside to outside - it is lined with tiles and lighted - very beautiful.  We spent the day on a cushioned lounge chair overlooking the city with the sea in the distance, had lunch and then cocktails and dinner on the terrace!  We didn't want to leave.  It was a gorgeous and elegant way to spend time in Barcelona.  Whether you arrive in a Porche or a random rental car (as we did) you are treated with the utmost care and respect.  The clientele was sophisticated and warm and international.  We had a wonderful experience and highly recommend the Gran Hotel La Florida.",5,2014,06,30
28,Great hotel,La Florida is an outstanding hotel on a mountain overlooking Barcelona with impeccable service and the view was amazing (water view.) It's a little far from downtown Barcelona but the hotel provides a free shuttle to drop you off and pick you up after you've wandered around taking in the amazing architecture and shopping. You will not be disappointed if you are fortunate enough to stay here believe me,5,2014,06,30
28,Great food - amazing view,"We stopped here for a drink after visiting the Tipadabo.  We didn't stay here - its REALLY far from the city and action.  
the pool area was really nice and the drinks were more expensive than in the city.",4,2014,06,30
28,Lovely hotel with an amazing view,"My partner and I went here for a week-long vacation and we absolutely loved the place. Just put off a little bit by the expensive breakfast buffet, which was really good but would be better to be included in the hotel room deal. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was sick the whole time we were in Barcelona, but that meant we got to maximize our room, which was really huge and with nice bathroom fixtures as well. 

Since the place is situated on top of the mountain, it was quite a struggle having to go to city center. But the place is made accessible by buses and the funicular train, which we quite enjoyed doing as it kinda takes you back in time. Would love to be back again!",5,2014,06,20
28,Not quite a 5 star hotel. Building is tired and dated. Seriously let down by one member of staff.,"My partner booked this hotel for two nights so we could chill out and relax for the end of our 7 day holiday. The hotel is set in the mountain range but it does have a shuttle bus service which needs to be booked in advance or you can get the metro and then a taxi or get the bus. It is slightly overpriced for drinks as there are no shops/ bars etc nearby (niche market). The room itself needed some tlc but it served its purpose and was very plesant. The bed was comfortable and a good view of the mountain. Temperature is cooler than in the city which was nice. Breakfast on the first morning was ordered and we waited, waited a bit longer. Alex (member of staff) was very apologetic, said the kitchen had made a mistake and are re-making it. Whilst waiting a very rude female kept hounding us saying the kitchen is closed despite what we were saying (she's the one who ticks off your room number, never smiled at us, just looked down her nose towards us). Only one breakfast came out so we shared it and left it at that. The rest of the staff were friendly, helpful and always smiling. We decided to have an evening meal there which came out quite quick but went cold very quickly due to the air conditioning being blasted towards the table - other guests had towels wrapped around them while others complained it was cold. The meal was nice even though cold. In the end I complained, Emile dealt with that complaint in a very professional manner (she's stunning so that helped) and had some drinks sent to the room, thank you Emile x. The next morning, oh yes, Miss Happy at the front of the restaurant area again ticking off your room number didn't acknowledge us but gave us a filthy look. Again the rest of the staff were very pleasant, happy, smiling and very attentive. Most of all the cooked breakfast came out and for two people. Overall it's a nice hotel in lovely settings but let down by one member of staff. And to that miserable female and I hope the management show you this; 
My wife works in a hospital as a Physiotherapist and the pay isn't that good. I work with elderly and disabled people changing their homes around to make their lives a little more comfortable and again the pay isn't good. We are not rich but we work very hard to help others have a better life as best as we can for very little wages but we do this as we enjoy the low paid jobs to help others. So when we save up and go on holiday (which is once every three years) we want to enjoy that time together as we rarely see each other due to working over 12 hours a day each, 6 days a week. On the 7th day, my partner is busy writing patient notes whilst I'm busy writing reports for each elderly/ disabled person. Wether someone spends 200 euros a night or 600 euros a night, it's still a 5 star hotel and everyone there is a guest. And that guest contributes towards your wages. You madam spoilt the remaining time we had at the hotel so maybe a job change would suit you better than working in a 5 star hotel.
To Emile and the rest of the staff, thank you all very much for trying so hard to make up for the mistakes of one person who has let you all down very badly.

28,Stylish hotel with great views,"Positives were the staff, the views, the facilities, the room and the breakfast. 
There were always staff on hand, they were always friendly and exceptionally helpful. The design of the hotel is really good with lots of little features and comfortable spaces. The room was large, very comfortable with a great view of Barcelona and the sea. The indoor to outdoor pool, sun beds, outdoor and indoor tables meant that there was always somewhere comfortable to relax. Finally it was a wonderful breakfast with the whole gamut of food and drink available. 
Negatives, there were a few but nothing that would stop us coming back. The Hotel is in the hills with great views but as we didn't have a car, it meant either eating in the hotel or getting Taxis. The food was all great, but the menu is small - better small and exceptional than large and average. We had 3 minor niggles in the room which the cleaners would have known about, but once we reported them they were fixed very quickly. 
Great for couples, especially if you want to relax and enjoy great views.",5,2014,06,17
28,excellent experience in this hotel,they have excellent shuttle bus service & amazing views & genuine service & tasty and wide gastronomic offer.,5,2014,06,10
28,"Amazing view, Smelly bathroom, Inconsistent service","MAIN POSITIVE 
Great view of the city. 

MAIN NEGATIVE
Strange smell in the bathroom and the toilet. Even after our complain nothing was done about it. Probably the sewage pipes could could be replaced or cleaned.

RESTAURANT
We made a reservation in the restaurant but when we came we discovered that the reservation was not made. We had to wait for 10 minutes even though the restaurant was more than half-empty. The main issue with the restaurant was that we had to wait over an hour for the starters and just sadly watch the people who came after us finishing their main course. I would not mind all of this if it was communicated before and I could make a choice whether to wait or go somewhere else. On the other hand, without any complaint from our side we were automatically compensated with a glass of very good wine. Furthermore, the waiter Daniel was a truly nice person and we greatly appreciate his effort.

BREAKFAST
The buffet breakfast had a nice selection of cheese, ham and fruit. We also appreciated the fresh salmon. However, getting a lemon to the salmon can be a problem. It took the service 15 minutes to bring the lemon I asked for. In the end I myself went to the bar located in the breakfast area and got the lemon right away. Furthermore, except tomatoes there were no other vegetables.

SHUTTLE TO THE CITY
Because the hotel is far away from the city, it offers a free shuttle 3 times a day which is great. We used it almost every day. On hot days we even got a bottle of water. However, be aware that you have to reserve it beforehand because the van can carry only 6 passengers.

OTHERS

The temperature of the shower is hard to regulate because it changes at random times.

In the evening we ordered three times a green tea through room service. Each time it came in a different form and we were also charged two different prices.

When I was reserving the shuttle bus to the city the lady at the reception would say that she would check and call back in two minutes. She did not and I had to call again.

On the day of our departure the hotel wanted to charge me 50 Euros extra. 20 for parking (we travelled by plane to Barcelona) and 30 for the umbrella which I borrowed but supposedly did not return. I borrowed the umbrella for 10 minutes to have a short walk outside of the hotel and when I was returning it I made sure I mentioned my room number not to be charged any extra. In the defence of the hotel I have to mention that it seemed to be just a pure clumsiness. They definitely did not want to get extra money out of me. When I mentioned that those 50 Euros are mistake there was no problem scratching them out of the invoice.

My girlfriend really liked the nice smell in the lobby of the hotel and when she asked about it over the email after our departure she did not get any reply.   

CONCLUSION
Although being a 5 hotel, to us it seemed like the stuff is lacking the appropriate culture of customer satisfaction. I believe that a little bit more consistency and precision in the service could increase the online rating of the hotel significantly. Despite of all the little downsides we would love to return to this hotel for its breathtaking view but only if the issue with the smelly bathroom would be resolved.",3,2014,06,08
28,Good value hotel in the hills!,"My girlfriend and I wanted a hotel with a pool, area to sunbath away from the city hustle and bustle for around 150 euro per night. It's not often this happens but our expectations (for the price) were exceed.

On arrival we were offered a complimentary glass of Cava and we'd been upgraded to a sea view room. Our room had impressive views, as did any view from the hotel. 

The pool area was fantastic with terraced gardens in which to sunbath. The breakfast had an excellent selection of Spanish meats and salami with some delicious goats cheese.

There is an air conditioned bus that leaves every 20 minutes directly outside the hotel for a few euros per person and the journey to the center is only 20 mins. A cab back will only set you back about 25 Euro.

I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxing break in Barcelona in a decent hotel just outside the center itself.",5,2014,06,02
28,breathtaking location,"stayed here now for the second time, last time 6 years ago - the location is just wonderful and the rooms are spacious, clearly worthwhile taking a sea/city view room - pricing is fair for what you get -
good reception service , the restaurant is good but has seen better days .. the spa area is clean, but a little run down - the general impression is that the hotel needs a little bit of money to invest to give it a soft lift again",4,2014,05,28
28,one nighter in Barcelona,"Great views from the mountain top but very far from city centre so go if you need privacy and an amazing view of Barcelona from the infinity pool which is great, but beware the room lighting is terrible hardly any lights you feel like waking in a dim lit room and the wind noise can really make your night terrible the walls and windows are not sound proof and you could listen to terrifying noise all nights.",2,2014,05,27
28,Great stay,"Always at the end of our stay in a hotel we ask ourself the question: ""Do we want to go back to this hotel""? Our answer is YES.
The only 2 negative expererience we had is too many trainees in this hotel and the prices of food and beverage are too high.
      
      ",4,2014,05,26
28,Vantage point in Barcelona,"Forget about staying in the touristy parts of this beautiful city - stay up in the mountain just 20mins from the city and enjoy a magnificent view from the hotel every day and night! The drive to and from the city is relaxing as you meander along the winding mountain road in the bus or taxi, passing small houses, lush foliage, panting cyclists and courageous joggers. next to the hotel is a lookout point for a clear view of the city and the Pyrenees mountains beyond.

The hotel itself is a beautifully conserved early 20th century building with wooden stairs, generous rooms and splendid views. if you hate modern buildings in an art-filled, historic city like Barcelona, this hotel will not disappoint. The cafe leads out to an outdoor pool while there is an indoor spa/pool also, I believe. Service is prompt and polite. 

The only downside is that there are no shops in the vicinity, save for a restaurant next to the amusement park and the beautiful Tibidabo church, both 10mins walk away. But if you plan well and buy what you need from the city, you'll not be caught out for conveniences. For the view and tranquility, this resort on a mountain is well worth the distance from the bustle of Barcelona city centre.",5,2014,05,15
28,"Fantastic Location, with awesome views !","A really special hotel in a special location, the views were breath taking. I arrived earlier than my colleagues and sat with a drink just admiring the scenery.

The whole hotel is very well designed and certainly offers you the components of a luxury break.

My room was split across two floors and really was unique in it's design, huge bathroom, dressing area, sitting area and upstairs cosy area too. 

The only faults I found were that my room had been a little mistreated by previous guests and could have done with a couple of touch ups to the paint work. But honestly it wasn't a big issue.

The staff were friendly, not sure if they were 5 star, but certainly 4.

Food was great - although I only sampled a salad and the buffet breakfast.

Really enjoyable break - highly recommended.",4,2014,05,12
28,Great scenario,"We spent a weekend at this Hotel. Its situated at the top of Tibidabo mountain with impressive views over Barcelona. It is far from downtown but if you appreciate scenic views at a good Hotel, you won't miss. The building is very nice and also rooms, clean and spacious. My ""but"" comes from the maintenance ... they have a sauna area and the days we were there the dry one did not work properly (I tried twice in different days and it was around 40 deg ...) and in the spa showers there was no hot water. They also had a problem with hot water in rooms (low pressure on hot water while in cold one it was perfect ...). Service was nice but maintenance is clearly not their strength. We also had a problem in the bar and the manager came to take charge and they sent a bottle of Champagne to our room ... so they reacted properly.",4,2014,04,07
28,"Great views and great hotel, a bit windy but great experience","Stunning views and great building. Phantastic for relaxing on a great building without city feeling.

Throroughlly enjoyed it and is a call hotel.

Parking charge a bit if rip off and should be included in hotel price !",4,2014,04,03
28,"5 Star looks, 3 Star delivery","Firstly this a beautiful hotel with absolutely stunning views of Barcelona.  If you are interested in the theme park and church then they are right here.

Website states free shuttle bus to the city from February, once we were there on 21st February I enquire. ""Sorry sir, it is not running yet"" - strange as the brand new Mercedes van is parked outside the hotel.  Now as previously stated, the local bus and funicular is easy to use and the staff explained all the ticketing options.  But don't advertise something you don't have.

On the first night the TV was not working, just the blocky image when the digital reception is poor.  After a few hours fiddling and a new TV, the engineer gave up.  We were offered the room next door but that had the same problem.  Next day at reception I was told ""only the local TV stations work at present"" - now this was pure BS because we later moved to another floor and all the channels worked fine.  Don't lie to me!

One morning we were woken early by a very loud noise coming from the room next door.  I called reception to be told ""it was probably just the wind"".  Now unless it was a freek typhoon or the chap next door had a particularly bad vindaloo it was not wind  - it was like a Chinook helicopter.  I called them up to the room and reluctantly they came up.  Turned out they were refurbishing next door and it was the industrial floor sander, at 8am!! Why place a guest next to a room with major work being undertaken?

And of course by evening we had the pungent chemical smell of vapours pouring into our room as they had now lacquered the floor.  At this point I demanded a new room as we would have had blistering headaches had we stayed.  My eyes were actually watering.

Now I must say we were given a beautiful duplex room for our last nights sleep, but the damage was done.

The restaurant, we avoided the posh restaurant due to the reviews and experience with the other one. We stayed for 4 nights and I honestly think I had one properly cooked meal.  Fish was rare, medium meat was barely cooked and had to be sent back, the hot buffet available some mornings was cold - staff just left the burners keeping it warm to go out.  Much like the hotel, looked great but once you delved in it was poor. Lord help you if you want a second cup of tea or coffee with breakfast, once you are seated the staff scurry away never to be seen again.

By our last night with the fumes, I really was ready to explode but my wife used all her charm to calm me down.

I must say the staff were very pleasant at all times, some extremely helpful but most of the situations were caused by the hotel's poor planning or forward thinking.

Overall a place never to go back to.  My recommendation would be to go there to have lunch to take in the view, just make sure your order a cold salad!

Bit like a 5 Star Spanish Fawlty Towers with a view....",3,2014,03,23
28,We had a lovely stay,"My partner and I stayed for three nights in October last year. 

LOCATION: The hotel is a long way from the city centre, but we considered that a plus. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel with half hourly services to the funicular. Take a short funicular journey then change to the subway to get to the city centre. Sounds tedious but, really, it wasn't. If you plan your journey, all in all it takes just 35 minutes. 

OUR ROOM/THE HOTEL: We both agreed we got a bargain. Our room was huge, clean, decorated neutrally but with some character, and our bed was comfortable. We had a big, lovely bathroom, and, yes some of the paint was peeling off the edges but with sweeping views of Barcelona through our bedroom windows, we weren't bothered! 

A pool is a must for my partner and the hotel's one is particularly nice.

SERVICE: Staff were friendly and helpful, although not overbearing.

THE DOWNSIDE: There is nowhere to eat near the hotel and due to previous reviews, we didn't try the hotel restaurant.",4,2014,03,02
28,Great honeymoon,"Although this review is a bit late coming, I wanted to say that we had a great time staying at the Gran Hotel La Florida during our honeymoon. Great views, delicious food, wonderful facilities and friendly staff. We couldn't have asked for much more. 

A few points to note: it was a way out of the town, and although the ride there was a lot of fun, and taxis and metro meant it wasn't too difficult to get back to, it was a little more expensive than we anticipated. Also, the food was quite expensive, but not beyond us for a few evenings in at the hotel and a few room service breakfast treats, which we ate from our balcony over looking the city and the mediteranean. 

While there, make sure you visit the nearby church and enjoy views from the top of their tower, as that's even better than the hotel!",4,2014,02,17
28,Great stay,"Excellent hotel . Breathtaking view over the city from the room.
Excellent service . Very kind and professional staff. Great to enjoy the spa and the heated swimming pool after a day in Barcelona city.
I've already made another booking for my next stay in Barcelona.",5,2014,02,03
28,Nice hotel with brilliant views,"Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend away. The views really make this hotel, we loved waking up to the view over Barcelona! The rooms were nice, although we did notice a few marks on the wall, scratches on the floor etc. We loved the inside pool area and used this every morning. Good hotel overall but wouldn't rush to go back :-)",4,2014,01,31
28,"Stunning views, take your binoculars!!!","This is a really nice hotel, impeccable, stylish, comfortable, elegant but at its heart I found it a bit mean.
It has everything a five star hotel should have, this price is really not bad, the views are stunning and once you have learnt it it really is easy to get into the city.
The pool is amazing if I was a multi billionaire I would have a replica built.
We went for my birthday at the end of October. I told them it was my birthday several times. I didn't get a happy birthday from anyone or even get the room I though I had booked and paid for. Having said that the room we had was fine and the bathroom brilliant..It just wasn't the room i thought I had booked but it was the same category.
A small bottle of water is 6 euros from the mini bar I thought this was mean as most hotels give you water these days all over the world.
If you do go please remember your binoculars for the view ..we regretted not taking ours. 
I am surprised that a hotel of this category doesn't have directions to get into Barcelona printed out ready in several languages for guests. If you get your tickets in advance it costs only ONE EURO to get where you want go although you take the bus, the funicular and a train.
Finding out how wasn't so easy.
Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious the waiters were all attentive but allowed guests in with robes, bare feet and allowed them to play with the utensils to amuse their children and pinch their noses with them and then put them back among the croissants!!! I hope this doesn't happen when you go!
We would probably stay here again, the adventure to and from the city was quick and efficient and a taxi less than 20 euros although it you order one from the hotel it takes about 20 mins to arrive. i still found it a bit mean for a Leading Hotel of the World.",4,2014,01,15
28,An Elegant Hotel Perched High Above the City,"We stayed here in November in a City View Terrace Room. The view was spectacular and we regretted that it was too cold to enjoy the terrace. The property is elegant and spectacularly rehabbed. Our bathroom was huge, with marble fixtures, a shower the size of a walk-in closet and double sinks. The winter rate was excellent, with a large breakfast included. It is indeed distant from the city center, but the winter rate was so reasonable that we could afford the cab rides to and from the hotel and still come out ahead of the rates charged by similarly elegant hotels in the city center. The pool and spa area is beautiful. The only disappointment was the spa service. I booked with hotel personnel a very specific service (hot stone massage) that was advertised in the spa materials in the room. I rushed back from the city so as not to be late for the treatment, only to be told by spa personnel that the hot stone massage had not been available for more than an a year, as the hot stone machine is broken. I was not interested in  the alternatives offered, and so lost precious time that I otherwise would have enjoyed in the city. This was a blip in an otherwise wonderful stay and I would definitely return to this beautiful hotel.",4,2013,12,31
28,Classic old world with mod cons,"I discovered this hotel about three months after it opened and it was absolutely marvelous.  Refurbished old building that had previously been both a hotel and a hospital apparently, it has rustic wood floors and a blend of old world and new.  Clearly a lot of money spent originally to compliment spectacular views of Barcelona, a high end restaurant and beautiful indoor outdoor swimming pool.  I have noticed that over the years some of the wear and tear is beginning to show.  Here and there un repaired cracked tiles or stonework in the bathrooms, one room with noisy pipes, recently had to call down after having just checked in to have hairs removed from the shower room, etc. Service generally good but the hotel has just a hint of neglect which is unfortunate as it has such 5 star potential having qualified in that category for me for years until recently.  Other little things like the tasteless scrambled eggs in the buffet breakfast - better to order an omelette or eggs freshly made in the kitchen as they are far better.  On more than one occasion the mists shrouding the Tibidabo upon which the hotel is built creates a wonderfully spooky atmosphere, as though you are checking into an old world hotel in the middle of nowhere.   However, despite some of the minor flaws which with a little attention are easily fixable, this hotel is most definitely worth a visit and is good value for money despite the extra cab ride to and from the city, and I will continue to stay at this atmosphere-laden hotel.",4,2013,12,27
28,This hotel is fantastic and views are out of this world,"I stayed here for a business conference and the hotel is immaculate, the views from my room overlooking Barcelona and the see were out of this world. the staff were friendly and always asking if you were well and the rooms were clean, very comfortable and spacious.

I will be returning to this hotel for a pleasure visit as I would love to experience the full use of the hotels leisure facilities, the hotel is on top of a hill which gives you views that you would not experience by staying in the city.

Would like to have Coffee facilities in room instead of going to the bar or ordering room service but full minibar is available in all rooms",5,2013,12,05
28,Best of both worlds; City Break combined with relaxing country hotel,"This is an excellent hotel with stunning views, attentive staff and beautiful rooms that are spotlessly clean. It's a little out of town and for me, that is the charm. You go into the hustle and bustle of the city and retreat to the tranquility of the hills, with the hotel set in a very quiet peaceful location. If you want to party down the Ramblas 24/7 don't come here. If you grumble about things being expensive , don't come here. The only complaint I had was the buffet breakfast had cold things that should have been hot. I just had an omelette instead, freshly prepared from the kitchen and washed it down with a few glasses of bubbly to help with hangover that was earned the previous evening sitting out on the terrace until past midnight savouring the wonderful view of Barcelona at night. We will be back. You must try the Tasting Menu with wine flight, great food and excellent wine at a very good price for a hotel of this quality.",5,2013,11,14
28,Fab Hotel,"This is a great hotel, amazing value for money. Pool, steam room etc great. Views were amazingt and the staff excellent. Chose room only rate as headed in to the city for breakfast most mornings. Yes its a not centrally located but we had a direct bus or metro +taxi options. Couldnt fault it for the money.
      ",5,2013,10,31
28,"Only overnight, but a great place to relax","Situated high up on the mountain, a short walk from the magnificent Tibidabo area, the hotel has either a perfect location or dreadful location depending on your perspective. Certainly, it's not easy to get in to the city, but then part of the appeal is being out of the city...

It's an oasis of calm after a busy day of sightseeing or a quiet corner to relax in after hours of meetings. Step in to your room and you're presented with a minimalist, almost rustic, look with plenty of space to unwind in. A huge and comfortable bed ensures a good night’s sleep, while the bathroom is as big as my first apartment. Hardwood floors complement light walls, while big windows bring in the Spanish sun. A large balcony leaves you with the entire city of Barcelona spread out in front of you, looking beautiful in bright sunlight or twinkling with streetlights at night.

Outside there's an indoor/outdoor infinity pool that runs alongside a bar area, the perfect location for a warm summer's evening dip and drink.

It's nearly perfect, with nothing but a handful of detail points that stop it getting the full five-star treatment. Some of the staff are perhaps a little stern, with snappy answers to simple questions, but I could put that down to a language barrier. Its isolation means there's little life around the hotel, apart from the Tibidabo theme park. This 1920's throwback is beautiful to walk around but presents a little extra noise during the day than you might wish for. Finally, the food and drink options are very expensive, even for simple things like a club sandwich.

You're a captive audience on that mountain, and the hotel knows that.",4,2013,10,29
28,Ideal place for a getaway,"This place is located in the tibidabo mountain, with a spectacular view to the city.
We took the junior suite, which is a pretty large room, with the view to the city. 
The shower and bathrooms where large and included an abundant supply of towels and spa robes.
The room is made twice a day, during the day for clean up and at night time for nigthly arrangements which is great.
If your looking for a get-away and not planning on visiting the city this is the place to be.",5,2013,10,27
28,True Gran Hotel,"This hotel is located high on the mountains on the outskirts of Barcelona and overlooking with a spectacular view the city , harbour and beaches . The valley rooms with view over the city are strongly recommended.
Instead of taking every trip to the city a taxi , a bus and the fenicular are as fast , comfortable and at a fraction of the costs.
The spa area is very nice and a must visit",5,2013,10,26
28,What's not to like??,"I'll never understand how opinions about hotel experiences can vary so diametrically among guests offering reviews. Case in point, the gran hotel la Florida in Barcelona.  Our three days there were about the best hotel experience we've enjoyed. The setting was magical with proximity to Tibidabo park, and the  majestic views of Barcelona. The staff to a person couldn't have been more accomodating and genuinely kind. Yes, the incredible breakfast buffet is a little steep, onsite parking as well, and you pay for everything including water. But given the level of luxury that this property evokes, it's very fair. Some of the negative comments seem so petty. Closeup pics of a piece of peeling paint or a loose bathroom tile. Get over it. All your blather does is make people hesitate to book here and make it that much more difficult for a terrific place like this to survive. Spain's economy is struggling. You're not helping.  Here's a tip. If you have a car, you can drive down the hill and park for free in a lot just north of the Mundet metro stop on vall d'hebron.This metro line whisks you anywhere in the city in no time.",5,2013,10,18
28,Do NOT let yourself fool by this tourist trap,"We had a gala conference dinner set at the Florida. More than 100 persons, prepaid and arranged more than 6 months before the actual event. When arriving with the conference guests in 3 busses, we were told that the dinner was in the basement - besides the pool. Nothing could be changed: ""You did not ask for the dinner to take place at the restaurant"". No, we didn't - it was obvious - who would want to dine in cellar-like sorrondings next to a pool - that we did not know existed ???
Very smart, Florida - we had to stay there, because we could not move +100 guests. But we'll never come back - neither will our guests.",1,2013,10,13
28,Mounted On The Mountain,"Sir Edmund Hilary would surely appreciate the lengthy climb to this Spanish luxury hotel which sits approximately the same height above sea level as his base camp would have on Mt Everest.

The wifey and I checked into an aptly named ""Sky Terrace suite"" on August 21st with a small group prior to boarding a cruise ship the following day. - We didn't all check into the same suite obviously !

The suite was located on the top floor and had a large balcony equipped with a generous jacuzzi spa and sun lounges. Very private in case you want to ""Go Commando"" in the spa. The views to the bustling city of Barcelona were fantastic and given the hotels vast distance from the city, the views encaptulated the entire metropolis. - Definately not the place to stay if you are thinking of walking into town! - or back to the hotel!

That being said, the hotel itself is quite nice with the peace and tranquility of the mountain top venue being interrupted on occaision by the screams of the children enjoying the rides at the nearby amusement park. - A library would have been a better idea perhaps? - Shhhhh !

The suite had plenty of glass facing the city and a shower large enough to host the entire Brady bunch or the cast of Gilligan's island with room to spare. Dual vanity basins supplied in the bathroom and the windows in the bedroom/living room and bathroom all open which was a good feature to let in the fresh mountain air or in case you want to jump out and end it all. 

Complimentary Wi Fi was excellent and extremely fast,probably due to the hotels height and proximity to the cities satellite communication towers,which also sit atop the mountain.

We found the front of house service and culture to be quite good and in the evening we had some tapas and drinks on the deck overlooking the city prior to dinner which was lovely.

Dinner was less than memorable ( unless you like to recall nightmares), however we had a set menu as we were in a small group so we didn't get an opportunity to sample an a la carte sitting. - That being said we had some kind of fish dish that would have been best left in the ocean. - Flavour and taste were obviously optional for this offering? - Other dishes also inspired my taste buds to consider committing ""hari kari""

Breakfast was significantly better ( thank goodness) and offered a large selection of buffet or a la carte options.

The property is comfortable,clean and attractive. the staff are well groomed and polite. We probably wouldn't stay here again if we visited Barcelona, but only because we would prefer to be in town where we would be in walking distance to what the city has to offer.

It's a 7 out of 10 for this one from me.",4,2013,10,02
28,Fantastic hotel.....brilliant location,This is a fantistic hotel. We were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. Very attentive staff nothing was too much trouble. Our room was lovely with a panoramic view over Barcelona. The swimming pool and spa is briiliant. Absolutely no hesitation recommending this hotel.  Just remember it is a bit away from the centre of the city but it isno problem to use public transport (which is great in Barcelona) or taxi abotut 20 euro to the centre. If you do get a opportunity to stay here you will not regret it.,5,2013,09,29
28,Barcelona at your feet,"We were a bit nervous pulling into the entrance of the Gran Hotel La Florida. It is remote, perched far about the city, with vast views out to the sea and the mountains. Other than an eccentric amusement park, there isn't much else up there..so you can't run out to a restaurant, you are up here for the experience of the Gran Hotel. 
Check in was a lovely experience: with a friendly staff, a glass of prosecco, and a tour of the hotel.

We had treated ourselves to a suite and it was simple, chic and comfortable. Fabulous bath tub, shower big enough for at least 2 people, huge towels and great amenities. 

The signature restaurant was fully booked, so we had cocktails and dinner by the pool, which turned out to be a very fun experience.  We ate tapas style, chatted with the bartender, and all in all had a lovely evening. 

If you want to be in the thick of Barcelona, this is not the place for you.  If you want a lovely retreat from urban madness, then you've found it.",4,2013,09,20
28,"Barcelona, With a View","I am an avid user of my American Express card and its program, Fine, Hotels and Resorts.  It is an excellent program where it finds these wonderful hotels with extra benefits and amenities.  Once I decide to book, the Gran Hotel La Florida, I came to tripadvisor to read the reviews.  Most were positive, except for the numerous comments about the distance away town, and I was looking forward to my stay.  

Upon arriving early, Maria, as the front desk was extremely helpful in helping me acquire an upgraded room.  The room had a beautiful terrace.  Very nice and relaxing. The hotel carries great products and the showers are amazing.  Even though the hotel is old, its nice that it has BOTH showers and tubs.  The pool is AMAZING.  Indoor and outdoor, L shaped, with the inside actually looking like a Turkish bathhouse.  The staff was extremely polite and helpful.

The distance in to town can be a hassle, however, it afforded me the experience of riding the bus, the tram, the metro and the furnicular.  I would had never done any of those things, if I didn't have to, so I did enjoy the new experiences.  When you want to get back to your room and not deal with the process, that's when it can be a little demanding.  One piece of advice, is to definitely find out the blue buses schedule.  Even though it picks you up in front of the hotel, during some days and some times, it does not run and then you either have to take the metro, furnicular, and red line bus, or a taxi.

I had lunch at the pool and the food was wonderful.  The breakfast buffet can use some help.  The eggs weren't that great and the variety wasn't that great and its pretty expensive.  I would suggest that they improve this part of the hotel.

I love the old character of the hotel.  The views are breathtaking.  Absolutely definitely worth the distance from town.  Feels like your are on top of all of the action.

Oh, I had a spa treatment and I forgot her name, but it also was wonderful.  Short lady with glasses.

Gran Hotel La Florida is a great little boutique hotel and I would definitely recommend it.
I ha",4,2013,09,17
28,Great views - very poor service,"This Hotel has Great views, the location is just perfect for a nice dinner with city views but we wouldn't stay here again.

Unfortunately there are many ""buts"" for a 5star-hotel :
- we arrived around 10am and were told that our room wasn't ready yet (which is fine since check-in isn't until 3pm). They said that it wouldn't be longer than an hour so we decided to wait and leave for the city afterwards. We ended up waiting for three (!) hours - which just ruined our day. On top we had to pay for the coffee and water we were offered while waiting (€6 each)
- room seemed to be okay until it turned out that there was obviously a mosquito-problem. That is of course not the management's fault at all but we had hoped fora little more assistance than just being handed some repellent 
- we paid a little fortune for a ""sea and city view terrace-room"" (room 105) and yes, the views were great and the room nice (even though the facilities are kinda old). What we didn't know is that these rooms are right above the restaurant and bar. There was a wedding during our Second night and the party with very loud music etc went on until 5am - no way to sleep through these noises
- even though we had hung out the ""do not disturb""-sign the room service knocked on our door three times the second morning for no reason (first time at 07:30 which made that a very very short night!)
- after we returned from our bcn-trip the second day the room-service had made up our room very nicely but had also for some reason taken my orthopedic pillow which I always bring due to some serious back problems. I kept on asking the receptionist and the house keeping but until the last day it never showed up again 

Of course we gave them feedback on every single issue we had and I must admit they could've handled it worse: they let us Off the parking Fee (€18/day which we didnt know about) and they called me two days telling me that they'd found my pillow and they'd send it to me via mail - it arrived today.

Still for 5star-hotel we had expected a little more and the things that happenend are just not acceptable so all in all we unfortunately can't recommend this place for your barcelona-trip.",2,2013,09,17
28,It has done its time,"The hotel has a beautiful view of the city and a quite nice furnishing. Unfortunately is very old and very far away from the city (ca 30 mins ny taxi) and expensive run (35/40€). You can see that ot is aged, the doors are old, the paintings coming down and is not kept well. Moreover the gourmet restaurant is not so gourmet....the food was ok but nothing special. Very bad and not at level of 5 stars os the breakfast: diety and low quality food. Very annoying is the fun park beside the hotel: no chance to lay down by the pool as children are screaming loud and you can hear and see them. Don't let you attract from the relatively cheap price compared to other hotels in barcellona. You get what you pay.",3,2013,09,14
28,Fabulous Long Weekend.......,"Just back from a long weekend at the Gran Hotel La Florida, and what an amazing time we had, from the minute we got out of the taxi, everything was fantastic... Staff so helpful and friendly... We Had been in Barcelona twice before so this was a lovely change from the hustle and bustle of the City but yet only an enjoyable bus/taxi ride away.. Pool and spa area fantastic...Rooms fantastic and very clean and nothing was a problem... Terrace restaurant a little pricey but when you looked at the view you got over it!!!!  Will definitely be returning ;)",5,2013,09,11
28,Total Relaxation,"This was the perfect place to end our vacation.  After finishing up on our Regent Cruise we chose this spot for some quiet relaxation before heading back to the states. 
The only suggestion would be to add a few more spa personnel to the spa area.  We really wanted massages and only one of us got a chance to partake.  Definitely would recommend this hotel for a short stay to rejuvenate and get your mind set that its now time to go home.    ",5,2013,09,03
28,Just love this place,"Do NOT go to this hotel if you are on a hen or stag weekend. Do NOT go to this hotel if you are on a tight budget. DO go if you like beauty and elegance and amazing scenery. Our fourth stay at this place and again we just loved our stay.  The dining experience is ok but we like to have an idle lunch here and then taxi down the mountain to a different restaurant each night. The rooms are lovely although I would suggest you don't pay the huge price difference to stay in one of their themed luxury rooms, the normal rooms are always fine and much cheaper. Love the pool, the spa, the view, all the fresh flowers, the staff and the building itself. We like the location but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.",5,2013,09,03
28,Nice place,"La Florida is a nice place. We stayed there in June. The service was good and the room comfortable. Breakfast was normal continental one with a lot of choices. My wife and me enjoyed the stay there and were close to the main spots of Barcelona, perfect location to start visiting. Nice spot for those who want to rest in Barcelona!",4,2013,09,03
28,What a disasterous decision it was to stay here.,"Its hard to know where to begin as there is so much to criticise about this hotel.

We chose this hotel to end our 5 day break to Barcelona. The location looked magical and it was. However, due to the isolated location it is essential that the venue has everything you need for a great escape from the city. This hotel doesnt even begin to provide you with the levels of service or accomodation it should. Its an utter disgrace.

It took us 2.5 hours to check in because they had to show us 6, thats right 6 rooms before we found one that was clean and didnt look as if a minor battle had taken place in the room. All the wooden floors were scratched, the bedding and seating were soiled and the walls looked like someone had taken an hammer to them randomly. I stress this wasnt just in one room but in 5 of the 6 rooms we were shown.

We ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night and it was frankly disgusting. Even the waitress (who was very sweet and helpful) seemed embarassed to serve the food. The wine was served into a chipped glass so that resulted in a 5th of the bottle being thrown away and when they bottle cost  40 euro to begin with that wasnt a great start. The bread was stale. The starters were no more than large pinchos but over £20 each. The mains were atrocious. I had a well cooked turbot that was supposed to come with a lime and coriander sauce. It was just a tasteless green sea of nothingness. My partner had the pork which was served on stale bread that was so hard it nearly broke her teeth.... and it was rare to the point of being uncooked. It was inedible and we explained as such to the waitress who did nothing about it but apologise.

The 2nd evening we thought we would have another try at the pool bar/restaurant. It was like eating food inside a refrigerator. We asked them to turn down the aircon and it never happened. A man with step ladders arrived mid meal and started banging something on the ceiling in the middle of the restaurant but the temperature never altered. It took 3 attempts for the chef to actually cook a burger... thats right, a burger. When I asked for a bottle of wine from the wine list I was told it was only served between 1-3pm????? I demanded a bottle and suddenly it arrived????????????

On the final day we checked out early, booked another hotel in Barca and went and had a fabulous last day. Sadly it was like a breath of fresh air to escape from the place! 

With upgraded rooms, better service, new catering staff this wonderfully located hotel could be fabulous. Until that happens, avoid at all costs.",1,2013,09,01
28,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,"We stayed at the Florida our 2nd week in Barcelona and I sincerely wish we'd stayed there the entire time. The hotel is really beautiful. Rooms are spacious with wide planked hard wood floors. Venetian plaster walls, soft plush beds and enormous bathrooms. We really loved the shower which was roughly the size of our entire bathroom back home. Our room also had a large terrace with a partial view of the city. The terrace was a great place to read and get some quite time but it also had a table large enough for us to have dinner at which came in handy a couple nights.  There was also a waterfall feature which masked noise from the road and hotel entrance which was right below us. Very smart design! 

The public spaces of the hotel were equally impressive. The star feature is of course the indoor to outdoor infinite pool with a view of Barcelona. It was pretty fabulous and the perfect place to lounge and have a Cava Sangria the size of your head. We made a point of doing that every evening we were there. Breakfast is also served on the terrace so we got to enjoy that view every morning. Great way to start the day. 

With facilities as amazing as these it would stand to reason that the staff would be equally impressive. Unfortunately that's not really the case here. If i could choose one word to describe the staff it would be ""hapless"".They were all extremely nice but communication between them was non-existent. We had a $100 spa credit from the hotel but it was near impossible to make an appointment. The Spa manager was also the person who provided spa treatments and as such was never at her desk which had us relying on the reception staff to make an appointment but they were not able to do this as only the Spa manager could make appointments.  It basically took 5 days to get them to book two manicure appointments and on the day of the appointment we were told by the spa they could only accommodate us for one appointment. In addition the spa was really disappointing. It's very possible that for things like facials and massages the spa is top notch however, if you are looking for a mani or pedi, I'd skip it. The manicure I received was not what you would expect from a spa in a high end resort...uneven sort of rough nails...And, the manicurist had a total of 10 bottles of polish all in the hot pink color realm...In the end I emerged after an HOUR with somewhat filed unpolished nails.  I would recommend skipping the spa and enjoying a Sangria by the pool instead!

I've seen other reviews which were critical of the location. Personally I though the location was great.  We had rented a car for our trip and getting into the city was just a quick 15 minute zip down the hill into Gracia to find a parking spot. It was also a good jumping off point for Trips to the Costa Brava. Overall it was a great place to stay.  When we make it back to Barcelona we will most definitely stay here again!",4,2013,08,29
28,This Hotel Deserves More Than 5 Stars!,"I'm still patting myself on the back for having had the good sense to stay at Gran Hotel La Florida during our recent trip to Barcelona.  A 20- minute cab ride from the heart of Barcelona, this beautiful, completely updated grand hotel is an oasis of calm perched on a hill overlooking the hustle and bustle of the city and the expanse of sea beyond it.  After a day of sightseeing, it was heaven to retreat to the quiet elegance of this hotel.  Our room was very spacious, tastefully decorated, well-appointed, and had its own large terrace on which we had lovely meals.  The dining areas are lovely, though we liked dining outdoors on their tiered patio/ pool area best of all, enjoying the view and the ""old Bilbao moon"".  The pool is an artully done indoor-to-outdoor waterway, and the spa and gym are all you could possibly want.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were spotless, the food was great, and, best of all, this may be the only place in all of Barcelona quiet enough to get a good night's sleep.  Don't even bother to look anywhere else.",5,2013,08,27
28,Beautiful and relaxing place,"Stayed here from 13th until 16th August for a girls weekend just two of us. 
Arrived at Barcelona airport & got a taxi to hotel which cost around 30 euros. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by 2 of the staff who opened the taxi doors and got our bags and showed us inside to check in and offered us complimentary drinks of fresh mint or lemon water which was a nice touch.
We got a room upgrade but as we arrived at lunchtime room wasn't ready yet which we were fine about and she said she would show us out to the terrace so we could relax outside and we would be called when the room was ready. She then got us a glass of cava and left us to relax. (We got our hotel deal off living social which included breakfast, cava on arrival, and a treatment) 
We got some sandwiches with chips to share.. The food was quite pricey £17 for club sandwiches and chips but it was nice food. 
When we were shown to our room it was the wrong one and was not ready.. the maid had given the wrong room number to the reception staff but when we went back to reception they offered us the room next door and said we could decide which one we wanted! 
Views were fab, room was amazing. Towels, robes, slippers were provided with toiletries. 
We got the bus outside which goes right to the centre, was 3 euros one way we got a taxi back and was 18 euros so not too bad if there's 4 of you may as well get a taxi. 
Service we received at hotel was great the whole time, we'd return to our room in the evening blinds shut, slippers out night lights on. 
The restaurant is pricey and we didn't rate it that much really.. loads of nice restaurants and tapas bars in the born and Vila 
Olympia which are cheaper too and more food for your money! 
Breakfast was amazing! Everything you could want cereal, fruits, pastrys, eggs and lots of other stuff one guy asked the staff to make him omelette and pancakes which he did. 

Could hear the amusement park but it didn't bother us at all! 

Overall we loved it!! And want to go back! ",5,2013,08,22
28,Stunning location,"We stayed at Florida to start our honeymoon this summer. 
The room, with a city view, was fantastic and finished to an exceptionally high standard. The bathroom was to die for!! The infinity pool and garden were the perfect place to relax and enjoy the stunning views over the city while having a cool drink from the bar. 
Our greatest 'gripe' was concerning the restaurant. When we approached the staff via the garden on our first night and asked if we could get a table we were told in a very cold manner that there were no tables for us. The staff member was very 'curt' in response. We ate by the pool, the food being OK but not really the standard we would have expected from this hotel. We noticed as we ate that the restaurant had many spare tables all evening.  
On a positive, the quality of the breakfast was very good. 
Had we realised how convenient the bus service was down to town we may have considered this however as we were here for 2 days it was fine to stay local and relax. The theme park down the road had no effect whatsoever. We could hear some of the rides but didn't bother us. We popped up in the afternoon to use the cafes there for lunch and to use the little shop for water etc. the church at the top of the hill is also worth a visit.",4,2013,08,19
28,Fabulous location,"We had a wonderful stay here, the staff were so helpful and friendly. Poolside bar is great. The views from way up in Tribidabo over Barcelona are magical; particularly at night. Our room (401) was spacious,clean and comfortable, bathroom wheel equipped. In the bar the gins have to be seen to be believed (humungeous)!! If you need to get into town take the bus from just outside the hotel; they come every half hour, cost €2.95 for a single ticket each way and run until late at night. Buses are clean, tidy and safe and go straight to Pl de Catalunya, excellent.",5,2013,08,15
28,Superb hotel,"We stayed at the hotel from 26th July for two nights. This hotel and the staff are amazing, from the cava on arrival to the facilities everything is excellent. Our suite had the best views ever! The pool and the terrace bar are superb. We were going to go into the centre of Barcelona for dinner but drinking cava beside the pool we decided to have a bar snack and chill out. The journey into the centre is 15 minutes and there is transport available at a very reasonable price, it is worth being slightly out of the city for the outstanding views. We loved this place and would return tomorrow if we could.",5,2013,08,13
28,Mixed Review,"I am looking at my rating and i would say it really should be bit above average but not a very good.

Plus Points 
Very Nice position, fab views, nice room, very comfy bed, large terrace and bathroom, The main restaurant -  we had the best meal of our whole holiday and although it was expensive was well worth it. Quiet hotel not too busy. Nice staff especially Horatio. Good Breakfasts 

Bad Points
Very  expensive for food and drink and there is nothing around it for quite a few miles so 
you have to pay the price (even though we had a car.) The bar food was basic and drab although they did make up some pasta for us one day. The bathroom had a separate toilet and it stunk of urine throughout the whole stay (5 nights) despite me telling the cleaner the day we arrived. I think they need to spend some money updating. The hotel is next to a theme park and there is a path that runs above the swimming pool in this park. While my husband and son were in the pool i was sat to the side of the pool some idiot threw a huge rock over the wall into the pool had it been 1 minute earlier it would have hit my hubby or son,  luckily they had swam around to the indoor section. There was a French/Spanish family sat on one of the tables and they saw this happen too and shouted to alert the bar staff. who called the manager who i understand went to the parc next door . I just thought there should have been some sort of apology ( i know it is not there fault but we were also their paying guests) from the manager - he did seem to skuttle off to a few tables  but never came near me or my husband .

All in all we did enjoy and as we then had 2 nights booked in the centre of Barcelona and a car the distance from the city was not a massive issue, Would I stay again ? No don't think I would as the cost of drinks and food would put me off.",3,2013,08,13
28,Beautiful location,"A beautiful hotel perched above Barcelona. From the moment you arrive you are looked after by the very friendly staff. There is a fantastic pool, spa, health treatments and gym (ask for the air-con to be turned on before you start in the latter). Beds are comfortably firm, showers are powerful and food is good, albeit the bar menu is a little limited, especially if you are a vegetarian. However the breakfast is varied and plentiful. The hotel is reached by a windy road up a steep ascent so be prepared if you get car sick. Altogether we had a lovely stay here.",4,2013,08,07
28,Terrible Experience - Has gone downhill and is more like a three start hotel,"While the hotel's website and some reviews make this hotel seem majestic, after being trapped there for two nights (and having to leave early) I can tell you it is definitely not majestic and is far from being a five, or even a four, star hotel. The hotel is quite run-down and while the staff is very friendly, the managers seem to be trying to reduce costs as much as possible while squeezing every penny they can out of their guests.

Having stayed in a number of hotels in Barcelona (such as the W and Hotel 1898), I now know that there are much better places to stay than the Gran Hotel La Crapola. 

Unfortunately the hotel's website and some reviews make it seem like this is an amazing hotel for a few days or even a week but my wife and I found out that after 1 night it's extremely run-down, there is absolutely nothing around the hotel except an amusement park for young children, the food at the bar is terrible, the ""spa"" is not really a spa (it's just two rooms where they give massages on-demand), the hot tub is luke-warm, the pool is quite cold, and the air conditioning in the room did not work (even after we were told it was 'repaired' turning it on did nothing).

It seems a lot of the hotel is breaking down and in disrepair although they do try to hide it well. The staff were very nice up until we asked to leave early they said it was fully up to the hotel and that they had already told the hotel manager that, so we didn't appreciate being lied to. I do understand that they seem to be hurting for money but a place that tries hard to be five stars really shouldn't treat their guests the way we ended up being treated. 

We ended up leaving early as the hotel is very, very, very far away from the best parts of Barcelona and staying at this hotel was literally ruining our vacation. The gourmet restaurant was great the first night but booked all other nights and the food at the bar is the same for lunch and dinner and not very good... so after eating it for lunch and then again for dinner again (and being told there was nothing else for miles) it was time to get out of there. 

This hotel is great for dinner (great food as long as you eat at the main restaurant, great views) and maybe for one night stay if your car breaks down when you go there for dinner. I highly recommend, however, not staying at this hotel and if you want to see some great views go just for dinner. 

There are amazing four and five star hotels in Barcelona and surrounding the Gothic District that would provide a much better experience - disappointingly The Gran Hotel La Florida is not one of them.",1,2013,08,07
28,"Good hotel, terrible service","We stayed here for a long weekend. Yes, the location is quite remote as it's up in the mountain but we knew that so no big surprise.

Good bits:

- The view is incredible. Literally amazing. Won't get much better than this.

- The room and it's view were fantastic. Very pleased with this.

- The lunch food was all good

Bad bits: 

The following points all refer to the Service, which was extremely slow, inattentive and sloppy at best. This seems to be a typical thing in Spain (and is probably why the economy is so shot) but it is not acceptable in a 5* resort no matter what country you are in. I should also point out that the hotel was extremely empty whilst we were there (with only the Southampton Football team to keep us company) so there is no excuses here. Examples would include:

- Taking ages (i.e. 30mins+) to clear our plates after we had finished a meal, despite waiter/waitress doing menial tasks around us like napkin folding, clearing plates from tables that others had already left, whilst we waited patiently to be served (despite being the only people in the restaurant at the time)

- Despite my above point, it will would still take the staff a LONG time to clear plates of people who had vacated the restaurant. On a couple of occasions we had to sit at tables where dirty plates remained, and it still took a long time to clear them from our site

- When somebody could actually be bothered to serve you, it felt like you owed them something for them taking your order, rather than them being happy to serve you

- The staff seemed upset that we could only speak English

- Probably the worst of all, on more than one occasion, a glass of drink (i.e. water/coke that still had about 1/4 of its drink left in it was taken away. Whilst they are slow to serve you initially, they then try to speed up your meal by taking food/drink away before you have finished it without asking. It was like every time they visited the table, they had to remove something so that they were seen to be doing something and 'attending' to you.

As it was a 'relaxing weekend trip', we didn't let this affect us too much but the reality was that it frustrating throughout. If the room and view wasn't so good, I definitely would have moved to a different hotel.

Considering the economic situation in Spain, I would have expected the staff to be working there butt's off for tips and to keep their jobs by attracting people back. The reality is that the staff at Hotel La Florida were unenthusiastic and disinterested at all stages during our stay.

However, I would like to point out that the front of his staff were excellent in welcoming us and very helpful during our stay. They are the only exception to the above points.",2,2013,08,05
28,"Amazing hotel, helpfull staff, fantastic location. A must","After reading some on the top ten reviews I was worried about our choice, all I can say is ignore them, I am a chef with Michelin star experience and worked all over and I can honestly say this hotel ticks all the right boxes, people slate the wrong things, wana be food/hotel inspectors putting down great hotels like this one, we had 4 truly fantastic days here and will without doubt return, the staff here could not do enough for you, yes the foods a little rustic in places but I would say that! There's a few walls that may kneed a paint touch up but it is the middle of season I'm sure the London savoy has this problems, ignore the negatives as I was amazed when arriving and I'm sure in fact positive you all will be to at the standard of this hotel. ",5,2013,08,03
28,Didn't want to leave!,"The view and pool in this hotel are amazing. We almost didn't want to go and explore Barcelona as we wanted to spend all day at the hotel. It's easy to get to when the amusement park is operating however if you don't have a car heading into the city for dinner could be an issue. Though quite pricey I would highly recommend the buffet breakfast which includes an array of fresh fruit, yoghurt, every type of cheese you could wish for, sliced meats and the list goes on. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Make sure you get a glass of the strawberry water near the reception desk.",4,2013,07,26
28,Most Amazing Hotel,"I have never stayed at a nicer, more accomodating, more luxurious hotel ever.  We spent our earlier part of our honeymoon down in the city where we were able to get all of our touring around and interest of all that bercelona has, out of the way, which is a must.  Our legs were tired and we were beginning to be burnt out since the service industry in Barcelona is not very accomodating to americans.  Right when we showed up we treated like royalty!  Had two glasses of cava right when we checked in and a very in-depth explanation of every part of the hotel (thanks Blanca!).  The view is the most amazing view of the city that you cant get anywere else.  I had no idea until the last night of our stay that if you went out on the deck on the second floor you can see all the way around to the other side.  One side is overlooking Barcelona and the Mediteranean Sea and the otherside is overlooking the rolling mountains.  Breathtakingly beautiful!  Also, the bathrooms in the hotel rooms are awesome!  We were very clean seeing as we never wanted to leave the shower or the tub.
The restaurant is amazing as well! One of my top 5 best meals, ever!  And I am foodie!!  Get the scallops! I said it was like harmony in my mouth!  I believe Pablo was our waiter and he was so great to talk to. I almost wanted him to pull up a chair and sit and eat with us!
Incredibly romantic, amazing service, breathtaking views, luxurious rooms, it is exepensive but totally worth every penny!  (let me correct myself, rooms are completely affordable, but food and drinks were exepensive - and totally worth it)",5,2013,07,24
28,Nice hotel but could be better...,"We stayed 3 nights at La Florida and as most of people have already said the view is really nice. Our room and bathroom were spacious and in good condition. The free wifi was enjoyable and the lobby area was very nice. 

The one thing which was particularly annoying was the fact that it was impossible to keep the sunlight out in the morning. Also the amusing park next door with kids screaming can ruin a bit the pool experience...

I also believe that the maintenance of the hotel is not at the standard of what I previously experienced in Leading Hotels of the World: there were many scratches on the table, outdoor cushion were old, waterfall not working...

I have to agree also that the pool area during the week end was very crowed and the service was very slow but the staff was always friendly. I also have to agree that the breakfast could be better. 

To sum up great location good rooms good value for money but not at the standards of a Leading Hotel of the World. ",4,2013,07,22
28,A far away secluded paradise,"First of all this hotel is barely in Barcelona, lets get this out of the way, about a 30 min drive from downtown and 45 min drive from the airport. 

The hotel has a spectacular view, and the rooms are more than spacious. 

since the hotel is not downtown you can afford to get a suite for about the same price as downtown minirooms. 

and the food is amazing, whether its breakfast, or you are ordering room service. 

the service is very personal and nice, efficient tour at the beginning of your stay will explain everything to you, even come into your room to explain the ins and outs of everything along with things to do in the the city. 

the spa was fully booked and we never got to try it. 

the but indoor/outdoor pool was amazing and if it got too cold you could dip in the Jacuzzi right next to it. 

this hotel is both couple and family friendly without annoying either.",4,2013,07,20
28,It is not a hotel I would recommend- needs a lot of work.,"I travelled to Barcelona in July, along with 14 other people including family and friends for my sisters Hen weekend. We had been recommended the hotel by someone we know and had been told it was one of the best hotels in Barcelona-- let me just say at this point it was certainly not.

Once we arrived in Barcelona we got a private taxi to the hotel- thank god we did this as some of the girls got taxi's that tried to charge them 70 euros which is a total rip off. We paid 100 euros return for 7 of us with suntransfers. 

The hotel is about 40 mins in a taxi, 20 mins of it is up the mountain to the hotel which is situated at the very top. This was certainly a big downside to the hotel, as even though we were not intending to be looking round barcelona in the day's, when we did go into barcelona of a night by the time the taxi had got to the hotel it was on 10 euros plus, which would then end up about 40 euros by the time you got into the centre. -- it was a lot cheaper on the way up to the hotel from the centre. 
We also found that by the time we reached the bottom most of us were feeling sick due to the drivers going extra quick down the mountain and swerving. I would definitely say this was a big disadvantage to the hotel-- if you are therefore up for sight seeing stay in the centre. 

Anyway, upon arrival at the hotel we were informed that our mum and her friend had been upgraded to the terrace room, and due to my sister being the bride she would be upgraded to a 'lovely' suite, with my other sisters being in the adjoining room next door. This obviously sounded like a perfect arrangement and we couldn't wait to see our room. 

At this point we were in complete awe of the hotel- saying wow to everything. We saw my mum and friends room and it was absolutely gorgeous. They had their own terrace area with sunbeds and a table and chairs (four) for eating . It was lovely. The bathroom was great and the room was very clean-- i would therefore recommend this room to be the best so definitely request it. 

After seeing the terrace room we could not wait to see the suite thinking if thats a normal room what will ours be like?!. Let me tell you it wasn't a sweet surprise. We went into the room and it was dark and dingy. At this point we had just had a downpour of rain, and there was a broken gutter over our tiny balcony ( that you would never sit on as it was just too small- id be surprised if you could get one person on it). The gutter had poured water down onto the balcony, therefore it was dirty and stunk. The door out to the balcony was shabby with bits of wood chipping of onto the floor of the room. 

The bathroom- there is an overhead shower and a shower head that you can hold and rinse your body with (like you have on a bath ) the overhead shower head did not work in the shower, therefore we had to stand there holding a shower head up over our heads to wash our hair . (room 505)

Our sisters room was even worse- their toilet didn't flush, there was no bathroom door, therefore if one person was in the shower any one could see in. The fridge door was falling of, It was probably the darkest room I have ever been in - actually horrendous.  (506)

This therefore led to me and the other bridesmaid going down to the reception to complain already within the first half hour. The reception were very very rude. Telling us we couldn't be moved. We tried to explain that my sister was the bride and really it would be great to get her a good room even another suite or a terrace , as it felt as though we had been downgraded and not upgraded. Still the woman said no no. Eventually we spoke to a lovely man who said they could move us the next day and gave us two terraces. He was the nicest of the staff, all the women were very very rude and just seemed as though they hated everybody (haha). 

Ok so from then on we had drinks by the pool which was nice, and some lunch . The lunch was medeoca and very very expensive. 19 euros for a basic burger or club sandwich. Drink prices- water 5.5 euros, cava 8 euros, 13 euros a cocktail. Also note, they should give you all a complimentary cava upon your arrival. They did this for some of us by not others- in the end we demanded all should get a free drink baring in mind the price you pay. 

Later on we had dinner at the restaurant- i would not recommend this l'orangerie restaurant. First of all your sat in a horrible dark pink room. The menu has like 6 things on it, so you need to be very open with what you like an taste's. And all meals start at 31 euro's. It was a very expensive night- but due to us wanting to stay in the hotel we just got on with it. 

The next day we asked the hotel to recommend a restaurant for us and the 14 girls as this was quite difficult to get bookings for. This was the biggest mistake we made. The restaurant booked us in to a restaurant they described as lovely called Farga's . We kind of booked it to cover our backs. They said they did tapas so there would be lots of choice. This sounded like a great restaurant. 
Come the night time, we were all in our terrace room and all decided we would ask the hotel to cancel and go down to the port to get some tapas- the reception went absolutely mad at us telling us if we did not go to the restaurant they would charge my mums card (which she let them scan upon arrival ) with 50% charges (not too sure how much this was ). At this point we realised that the hotel were obviously being given backhanders from this restaurant and they had made a deal with them to get custom. We therefore had to go to the restaurant- which is awful in itself to feel u have to go somewhere you don't want to. The hotel told us the restaurant were super busy and so we were holding them up-- upon arrival to the restaurant there was NO ONE THERE but us. It was actually insane . The food was appauling you kind of actually felt scared to eat it incase you caught something. THEREFORE OVERALL DONT ASK THE HOTEL FOR SUGGESTIONS WITH RESTAURANTS. Also i cannot believe they think its ok to charge your card without permission- THEREFORE IF YOU HAVE BEEN CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENTS AFTER-- YOU NEVER NO WHAT THEY'VE ADDED ON.

The pool area-- looking at the pictures it looks as though the pool has lots of sunbeds. I was actually shocked at the amount of sun beds or lack of sunbeds. Id say there is about 15 max. On most days we would have to pile up lots of towels and about 5 of us lie on the floor- this is literally how bad it was . This is why its therefore better to get a terrrace room as you get two sunbeds of your own. -- honestly the extra money is so worth it. 

The pool and spa was nice - could of done with quite a bit of money being spent on it. 

Overall we all said the hotel looks as though it has been hit quite hard in the recession. It is shabby and old, and could do with a lot of work and money being spent on it. They also seem as though there is a lack of staff- obviously due to lack of funds. 

When ordering food and drinks it takes a while for them to bring it and things like that that you notice. And also the sunbeds in the rooms. When it rains they leave the covers on the beds- whereas if there was a lot of staff in a good hotel these would be brought in- this has therefore led to them being a dirty white colour . All could do with new covers and new sunbeds. 

All the decking could do with some paint just to freshen it all up. 

We paid £89 a night for this hotel- and that is why i don't feel as angry as I suppose some people might paying £200 a night- look on expedia and get some cheap deals! then you will enjoy it more. If we came again we would stay somewhere like the W hotel- meant to be fantastic and in the best position. ( you can see it from the hotel)

Be prepared if you do stay at Gran hotel la florida- you will spend a lot of money in the hotel on food and drinks. 

As a suggestion if any of you are traveling to barcelona on a party weekend or like us hen weekend, we did a cocktail class with bcn events. The class was in the el borne area at a place called collage social club - this was absolutely fantastic. I would really recommend this-- adds something fun. 

We also went to tragaluz restaurant this was fab too! - expensive but great.

Hope this helps - i wish we had a detailed comment when we made the decision - overall i'd therefore say don't waste your money, get yourself in the centre in a gorgeous hotel or one of the sea front. 

Enjoy :)",3,2013,07,20
28,I wish we liked it here.,"The views were amazing! Our room had two balconies with amazing views.  It was our first time in Europe and we really wanted to explore. Unfortunately this hotel was hard to get to and service was not good. There was opened and half eaten food in our refrigerator for our whole 7 day stay. And really,  my husband and i felt the staff would treat other guest better than us. We are opened minded people, newly weds, and we really felt we gave this hotel a chance for recovery. Never happened. I will visit Barcelona again, I will just stay somewhere else. :)",3,2013,07,18
28,"Gorgeous View, But A Money Pit","I booked this hotel for our last night in Barcelona (having spent the majority of the trip in the city, Pamplona and San Sebastian) when we were originally going to have a car. We wound up taking the train to our other destinations and in hindsight I should have cancelled this reservation and stayed in the city once again, because it's not only very pricey to get to and from the train station and airport, but it is also far from any sort of convenient store. I had forgotten to bring an essential toiletry and went down to see if I  could purchase it at the front desk. Shockingly, they don't provide any sort of extras (not even a way to pay for them) for their guests and I would up having to take a taxi to the closet Farmacia that cost 30 euros (since all of the taxis charge to take the trip up the hill). Even though they upgraded us to a very spacious room with a fab view, we waited almost 2 hours for it to be ready and didn't get into the room until almost 5pm, which was disappointing since we were only spending one night here. Despite the fact the air conditioner would not turn off (the staff couldn't even fix it), the bartender charged us extra for a double pour of wine and there were tiny ants crawling in the bathroom floor, we tried to make the best of it.",3,2013,07,18
28,A  Very  Memorable  Stay,"We stayed four days at this hotel to attend a very dear friends wedding , what an excellent hotel with the most stunning views overlooking Barcelona.   Reception staff were so polite and friendly with impeccable English , apart from checking us in , we were given a guided tour of the hotel and taken to our room.   Super bedroom , the bed was seven feet wide and so very comfortable.
Beautiful towels and robes and an unlimited amount of towels around the indoor/outdoor pool.
The buffet breakfast covered every possible taste with high quality foods.
Would definitely recommend this hoteland would stay here again, if you want to leave the hustle and bustle of the city this is the place for you.",5,2013,07,13
28,A little luxury on the edge of town,"We stayed here for 4 nights and if I go back to Barcelona I don't want to stay anywhere else! We don't usually stay 5* but it was a treat. The hotel was clean, well maintained, our room was lovely and there were fabulous flowers everywhere. The pool is great and twice I was the only user. The staff were absolutely the best! They were helpful and attentive but not intrusive or over bearing. It may be 5* but it is not stuffy!  We used the Bus, funicular and metro to get into town with a T10 ticket which was easy to buy See other reviewer below for more details and as they said it was easily done in 35 minutes. A word of caution check your guide book maps with the station transport maps because ours wasn't accurate and it took us a while to work out where we were trying to get to. The signage isn't that intuitive but once you find the right track, the station screens display all the trains stops. Also when going to peu del funicular station which is where you change onto the funicular to go up to Tibidabu and the hotel, don't be on the front carriage as it is a short platform and you won't be able to get off. After this incident we stuck in the middle carriage.  Oh and we heard no barking dogs nor were disturbed by the amusement park which is pretty low key.",5,2013,07,12
28,What A Dump,"I had the fortune of staying at this charming but out of the way hotel when it opened and I thought it was one of Europe's great Destination Hotels. Well 10 years later, things have changed...
I was appalled at the condition of this hotel as it was absolutely filthy, worn out, scratched, broken, mildewed, unkempt and not suitable for any 5-star Hotel in Europe. Shame on Huse Hotels for allowing this once GEM to become an ugly duckling. The hotel is under staffed, the breakfast buffet is deplorable and the hotel allows locals to use the beautiful stainless steel pool (one of-a-kind) and facilities for a fee. The service was quite friendly but clearly understaffed as waits for drinks or meals by the pool were far too long. The view is still magical but this lady has faded. The hotel no longer offers complimentary shuttle service so if you want to go into town, plan in advance, order a cab 30-minutes before you want to go, and be prepared for a 20 to 30 euro ride each way... My pictures will show why this hotel has faded but I had spent 3 nights at the Hotel Majestic prior to this stay which was brilliant and I was so looking forward to a return at Gran Florida and left with the utmost of true disappointment...BEWARE!",1,2013,07,09
28,Relaxing Oasis with Gorgeous Views,"We enjoyed a pleasant and relaxing 3 night stay in this very peaceful part of Barcelona after staying downtown and doing many tours.  It is a great place to relax and unwind by the pool and to enjoy the stunning views of the City.  Upon check-in, the staff greeted us outside as we came out of our taxi and the entire staff were warm, friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  We are also grateful for Olga who went extra mile to make our stay special and who was truly wonderful with our 12 year old son.  If you have children there is an amusement park next door which is great for kids. The breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices.  If you are looking for peace and quiet this is a perfect place to do so in Barcelona.  We did not mind taking the taxi ride downtown and back to get together with friends or go for dinner.  As a Leading Hotels of the World member we enjoyed a room upgrade, internet access and complimentary breakfast which was great.

I would however be very cautious with taxi drivers taking you back to the airport as we ended up with one who took us to the wrong terminal after I clearly stated the correct terminal to him and showed him on paper.  He led us to believe that the airline we were flying with had recently changed terminals which for him increased his fare.   We were familiar with the going rate and were charged double the price and ended up paying 66 euros.  We had left early to catch our flight but the terminals at the airport are at some distance from one another and after realizing we were at the wrong one and taking another taxi back to the right terminal it caused us to miss our 630 am flight by 10 seconds.  We then had no choice but to purchase other airfare with a different airline company as the one we were booked with was sold out for 3 days.  It ended up being costly due to a taxi driver who simply did not care about his customers.  We reported the incident to the hotel to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen to other guests.",5,2013,07,09
28,"Gorgeous views, Excellent staff","Excellent hotel, the staff are fabulous especially 'Bob' who works on the front of house team, hes french and speaks a number of other languages very well i believe but was such a great welcome host. 

The pool staff are also brilliant. Indoor and outdoor pool, hot tub and hidden away in the indoor pool bathroom/shower area is a steam room and sauna. The hotel is sat next to a theme park on the mountain and you can hear the screams of children throughout the day but this isn't a major issue if you have an ipod. You can walk around the back of the hotel to the theme park which is called Tibidabo which has a roller coaster and log flume and a number of other rides if you fancy a day of thrill seeking....better yet you can also ascend to the very top literally of the Sagrat Cor Cathedral which is located smack bang next to the theme park. You can see this cathedral all the way from El Prat airport believe it or not. 

The views from the theme park, Sagrat Cor and the hotel are easily the locations selling points and if you have a really good camera you can grab yourself some excellent pictures. The Nou Camp stadium is only visible from the theme park viewing deck NOT the hotel (just incase you are wondering or care). 

The hotel has its own restaurant which is very expensive but you can book a night there if you wish, it also has its own in-house menu which again is quite overpriced for what you get on some dishes. I am vegetarian and there wasn't alot of option which was disappointing. However the breakfast buffet is good and there are alot of familiar options to choose from for vegetarians.

The hotel never feels overly busy and there is always loads of sun loungers to choose from. It gets very hot in the hills and sun cream is essential, my girlfriend suffered from heat rash on her chest area without knowing how hot it actually was! 

The hotel celebrated its 10th anniversary while we were there and it threw a very swanky pool party which was packed with the rich folk of Barcelona so it seemed, guests were invited to join in with all the free alcohol which we of course lapped up and in the process met 3 other young British couples and had a fantastic evening.

There is a gym and spa which we didn't use but are there if you wish to use them.

Transfer from El Prat airport to the hotel came to roughly 32euros one way.

British Airways are located typically in Terminal 1 which is on the far side of the airport so you literally drive all the way around and the fee ticks up 5euros when your actually in the airport area, had they been in T2 you'd probably get away with 25-27euros instead (just a note for those who want to know).",5,2013,07,07
28,Spa - Couples massage,Couples massage. Did the Orient package. In 1 room both had foot scrub - additional full body scrub. Showered together after body scrub then back to the room for full body massage that included a facial. After the massage we relaxed on the pool deck with good food and cafe con leche.,4,2013,06,30
28,Fantastic views,"A gorgeous hotel. We were upgraded to a suite without having to ask. Breakfast was included, it would have been very expensive I'd we had to pay for it separately, it was only fine, service was slow and our took ages to make toast. The food was inconsistent, for example my friend ordered white coffee and over our stay recieved 4 different variations! 
The staff are very friendly, views are amazing as is the sun bathing area. ",4,2013,06,25
28,Romantic getaway!,"Stayed here for one night to celebrate our anniversary with my boyfriend. Despite living in Barcelona, we didnt realise that there is a direct bus from Plaza Cataluyna that stops directly outside the hotel. Taxi costs about 15-30€ depending on where you get it from. 
Overall experience was excellent, staff were really attentive, the spa / swimming area was more limited than we expected but sufficient. Excellent cocktail selection which was reasonable priced for a 5 star hotel. 
Our room had a fantastic view of Barcelona and our bed was unbelievable comfortable. Breakfast in the morning had plenty to offer including off menu items that could be ordered. 
Only issue we had was when we ordered room service and the food turned up cold however it was reheated and bought back with no problems.",4,2013,06,23
28,Great for a mini break,"Overall a really nice hotel, a bit out of town and could do with a better range of food, but beautiful view and very relaxing. Gluten free friendly.  For a full review check out my blog www.empowernetwork.com/whitewavehealing",4,2013,06,21
28,Brilliant Stay with Amazing Views,"We have just returned from this hotel and found it to be an absolutely amazing experience!!
We were in a deluxe room with a city view. The views were spectacular!!!
The staff were brilliant and so helpful, even printed off our bus tour tickets as we had forgot to.
We hired a car from Reus airport to the hotel, and subsequently left our car outside the funicular station until we departed (mainly due to getting the wrong funicular on the way back from Barcelona and being too lazy to go and collect it).
Navigating around is very easy on a bus to the funicular then jumping on a train to the centre. 
We didn't have breakfast as it was a little too much for us, but we did have room service on the last night that was really worth it!!! Steak and burgers, both cooked to perfection!
The pool was a bit cool, but we were happy in the jacuzzi and lounging by the indoor pool. 
Drinks on the terrace was lovely.
All in all an absolutely amazing hotel, and we would definitely love to return again!!!",5,2013,06,19
28,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for four nights 30 may to 3 June 2013,  with my husband celebrating wedding anniversary and our birthdays. Got a great deal. hotel on website looked amazing and was amazing. We were initially concerned we were a little way out of centre, but were also going to get away from it all and relax. The hotel was perfect for us. We were made to feel very welcome and were shown round hotel whilst waiting for rooms. We got a taxi from airport as recommended by a friend who is from Barcelona, this was a very reasonable €35. There is a bus stop right outside hotel, either to the centre of the city or one that takes you to the funicular, then you get train and mets to centre, taking about 25 - 40 mins to centre. On the way back as we stayed out late we got metro then taxi. Breakfast was included on our deal and there was an excellent choice/variety. We did not have dinner at hotel as we were out and about. Would love to return to hotel again.",5,2013,06,17
28,"Overbooked, reneged on my reservation","This hotel might be nice, but they overbooked and kicked us out, our entire party of three; we'd booked three separate rooms. They said they had a conference there that they were committed to supporting, and we as individuals were out of luck. Pretty clear we were second class citizens. Sent us to a related property, the Rey Juan Carlos 1, which was okay, but it was nothing like this one. They didn't go to any lengths to apologize (no room upgrades, no ""dinner on us"" or anything like that, as far as I could see). I was not impressed by this treatment at all. Book here if you'd like, but you might not end up here.",1,2013,06,16
28,Great Hotel,"We stay in this hotel because they recommend the view of Barcelona at night, an is true the View of the city all the way to bay is Amazing, they have a old building that combined to modern stuff like the pool are fenomenal, the spa is all so very nice and the food to(we have only breakfast and some appetizers with wine at night)We certainly always stain at this hotel in Barcelona ",5,2013,06,15
28,What a view !,"Very pleasant in every way even if some requests were forgotten even if promised. Very polite any way and will stay again. Nice location and not too far from the city. One of the best hotel views ever and worth the 15 min cab ride to the city. Nice pool area and spa.
      
      
      
      
      ",4,2013,06,13
28,CERTAINLY NOT A 5* PLACE!,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel way way up the Tibidabo mountain and yes, the views of the city are spectacular.  Fortunately, there were another couple of friends with us so the expensive taxi rides up and down (approx Euro 20) per ride were shared but you have to plan your day as going back for a couple of hours pm rest and nap before going back out for dinner would really add Euro 100 per day to your stay!  The hotel is tired and badly in need of a re-furbishment, especially the rooms and the breakfast room is truly shabby with awful industrial chic (not chic at all!) cheap wooden-top tables with thin metal legs!  Ghastly stuff and should be chucked out! Breakfast was not included in the price we had but managed to do a deal with them at almost half the price otherwise you would be parched and famished by the time you reached the bottom of the mountain to get a cheaper cafe style coffee and croissant.  There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, which is very mean of them.

The breakfast buffet was very basic and whoever the pastry chef is, needs to go back to school! The pain au chocolate and croissants were dry and mean in size, so overcooked, they were not worth bothering with.  We had to ask for muesli as the basket on the table only contained All Bran (!) and Coco Pops in mini boxes.  As if that's the kind of cereal to offer in an upmarket hotel!  They then produced mini bags of Kelloggs Muesli after that.  The yoghurt with fig compote in little jars was the best though!  Fruit was melon in every colour only and maybe a plate of pineapple.  No blueberries, red fruits or such at all.  Eggs in the hot covered dish were scrambled and unseasoned; bacon was wet and fatty and the toast was appalling!  Dried sliced sourdough left over from days before or that horrid sweet type of sliced white bread the continentals seem to think is okay.  Coffee was passable, so to pay more than Euro 16 each for a bit of muesli and a coffee and break your teeth on stale bread was more than enough to charge! 

HOTEL!!! Please get your breakfast up to 5* standards expected by seasoned travellers!

I was seriously concerned about the beds as someone has written that they were hard and believe me they were fine.  Good quality pillows and the bed linen was excellent, so at least that was a big plus as I had packed a single mattress topper, I was so paranoid about finding yet another 5* hotel in Europe with terrible beds.  There have been a few, I can tell you.

Bathroom was very good - shower lovely and such huge bath sheets!  Wonderful!

One of the curtains was hanging off the pole one end on arrival but I asked for it to be fixed and it was but one of the bedside lights never worked at all and was not fixed even though I told them about it.  Very bad service really.

Staff were very nice though and helpful - no faults there but they did not seem to be aware of how much the taxi ride TO THE AIRPORT costs.  Taking a taxi FROM THE AIRPORT WAS only Euro.25, but going on a Sunday pm when the roads were not busy cost double that!  Outrageous.  They should have sorted this with local taxi cabs for a fixed rate in my opinion.

We ate in the L'Orangerie one evening but it was not worth the money.  Having said that we also had some pretty dreadful food in the city recommended by a posh Spanish lady, so that didn't work.  Any English person never having eaten a lobster paella could do a better version!

Enjoy your visit to Barcelona if it's your first - it is very clean but busy and you will get ripped off a little here and there!  Wonderful Gaudi stuff of course and a very long day trip to Figueres to see the Dali Museum was fabulous.   2 incredible geniuses from the same place!",3,2013,06,11
28,A hotel with views of Barcelona not to be missed,"My wife, two teenage daughters and I stayed at the Gran Hotel La Florida for 3 nights at the conclusion of a week long cruise. I wanted a place to relax in contrast to what one does to relax during the cruise. I will admit that reading all the negative reviews a week in advance of staying here brought concerns of what may lie ahead. Let me start by saying this is a wonderful hotel that prides itself on providing top notch service and has a location to die for in the hills overlooking the entire city and expansive coast line. Given the great weather and clear skies, one can see for 30-40 miles with unobstructed views. It's not to be missed.

We arrived very early on Sunday morning, coming off the ship and arrived at 9:15am. As one might expect, our rooms were not available. The hotel politely explained this, provided a quick tour and directed us to the terrace overlooking the city near the infinity pool. They provided drinks and allowed us to relax while we waited our rooms which they promised would be the first cleaned once they were available. They delivered and we were in our rooms at noon despite a 3pm check in time. The rooms were very large adjoining city view rooms with oversized  terraces. 

The food at the breakfast buffet was excellent. What a way to spend time at breakfast, surrounded by such a view of a city such as Barcelona. I say this and will admit that I am not a touchy, freely person, so the view is really that good. We had lunch on our first day but choose to explore other restaurants in the city where a larger menu and greater variety would be available. 

My family and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The service is exceptional as the staff tries hard to please. That said, there are some aspects that one should consider in staying here. It's a 30€ - 35€ taxi ride depending upon where in the city you are going. If you are in Barcelona for the first time and want to explore and be in and out then a city centre hotel might prove more practical. There are occasional sounds of children having fun from a nearby amusement park. Given it was June, this was only open our first day until 9pm. This noise can be heard from the outside terraces, not inside the rooms, so please do not be overly concerned by it. Lastly, like any hotel there are a few tweaks that one can highlight as needing attention, an example would be to replace the terrace covers over the terrace. This is a nice to have, not a need to have. Everything that needed to work in the rooms and the public areas did so. We had very enjoyable and restful evenings.

This hotel is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World.  I would say this hotel clearly fits within the category.  Having spent other nights in this collection of properties, the hotel and service meet the standards of this group (in my opinion). 

When one takes everything into account, including rooms, service, restaurants, views, room rates, location, this hotel offers exceptional value for the right traveller.",4,2013,06,11
28,Unbelievable views and fantastic staff,"The views from this hotel are truly spectacular. We had a corner room with views of the city and hills surrounding Barcelona with the sea in the distance.The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. The outdoor bar overlooking the city is spectacular. The rooms themselves aren't the most extravagant but views more than make up for it. The location comes with a slight down side in that getting into the city is a little difficult. About a 15-20 minute cab in and out, but a nice drive up and down from Vallvidrera. Make sure to call for a cab well in advance as it can be awhile before they make it to the hotel. We rented a car there for a couple of days...wouldn't necessarily recommend driving into Barcelona, although not too difficult.The hotel is also a great jumping off point to get on the highway to visit the Costa Brava if that is a thought. Overall great place to stay if you don't have to be located in the city.",5,2013,06,08
28,Great place to stay,"A truely wonderful place to stay location wise, its on a mountain out of the City and the views are stunning.. The room was more than we expected with two rooms along with a fantastic bathroom and the walk in shower itself bigger than some bathrooms I have seen and a double balconey....... The staff could not do enough for you they were friendly and most helpful giving great advise........the trips into town were great fun and quick along being cheap using the T10 ticket the buses stopped outside the hotel run every 30 minutes and on time, the last bus back was not that late back, which was not a problem for us, and if you are no late for the bus the taxis are not a crazy price, but talking about crazy prices that is the only disappointment about the hotel, the price of the food in the hotel was overpriced and the one day we did have breakfast it was very ordinary.....that being the only reason way I can not give it 5 Stars excellent rating, but saying that it would be the only hotel in Barcelona we would consider staying at......",4,2013,05,30
28,Week away,"Stayed here in May. Great hotel, as per other reports the location is a bit out of Barcelona, but if you get a T10 ticket you can access the bus 111 which drop you outside the funicular this take you straight onto the metro and into Barcelona. The whole trip is 40 mins! And for 9. 80 euros! For 10 trips easy! If staying at weekend get t2a or t2b bus. Round trip two people 10 euros but cheaper than taxi 

The hotel is lovely and quiet! The staff are fantastic! Nothing is to much! They are extremely helpful.  I have read the reviews re the dog barking! We slept with our window open facing the MountainsNo dog barking and no noise! The fun fair is only open Saturday and Sunday! 

Spa is lovely, views great! 
Breakfast not so great but was included in our overall price!

Would stay here again! It's not the savoy but it is lovely",4,2013,05,16
28,Exceeded expectations,"Combined a stunning location with a stylish and artistic renovation of 1920s architecture, very comfortable and spacious accommodation with attentive and friendly service.  Divine food and drinks which ranged in price from mid to high, but offered quality and value every time.  Price included a spectacular breakfast and relaxing and attractive spa.  
Having something of a horror of amusement parks I had lost sleep worrying that it might ruin our break, however we found it charming in style and moderate in volume and if anything enhanced our time listening to people in the distance having fun.  You could walk through the park-like surround for free.  We also walked to the main entrance by road (a relaxing stroll from the hotel) enjoying a stunning sunset behind the mountains, and then a glorious view over Barcelona watching the lights transforming dusk into night.  Heavenly.",5,2013,05,15
28,"No where up to standard of a ""leading hotel of the world""","Well where do I start we have stayed in many varying degree of hotels around the world and I can quite honestly say this was one of the worst!

The hotel is:-
1) is tired and tatty and well overdue a renovation
2) The food is quite dreadful even the burgers and club sandwich left a lot to be desired.  Even after sending the food back it arrived re heated and the same burger with the same cut in it even though it was under cooked in the first instance.
3). No snacks in the mini bar as per the mini bar menu
4) no complimentary water as is the norm in such hotels
5) no coffee making facilities 
6) the room wasn't cleaned and then even after a request to house keeping at 7pm they never arrived however after more chasing when it did arrive the room was not cleaned properly and bathroom was not restocked 
7) we sat in bar waited 15 minutes to be served but eventually gave up
8) no shuttle offered into Barcelona however we were told the only way to get into Barcelona was to get a cab or a long journey by public transport changing from bus to metro however by cab expect to pay €60 to €100 euro round cab journey to and from the hotel
9) poor air conditioning in room
10) No movies on TV
11) Dogs barking all night outside hotel
12) Noise from theme park next door to prevent enjoyment of pool area
13) Duvet stained and filthy
14) on the 2nd night there was a delivery to the hotel about midnight that made so much noise as to wake us

Quite honestly I would class this as worst leading hotel of the world ... No idea how it got the accolade of leading hotel if the world! 

There are two positives one from the friendly staff quick to please but sadly no action from management and the view is great but a quick drive and photo would suffice.

To top it off on check we explained our concerns and issues and we were told to expect a call from management and no one one called.  Obviously they take customer service really seriously ""not""!",1,2013,05,15
28,Great hotel - great view - expensive food,"Had read many of the reviews before booking and given the overall consensus went ahead and booked. Definitely a good choice, for us, having been to Barcelona and stayed in town once before.

The only significant 'negative' points from the bulk of reviews for this hotel have been the cost / atmosphere in the restaurant and the distance from town. The first is well founded. The second should, for the most part, be ignored.

I am afraid that for the 'average' customer the prices for food are too high, but from what we saw and ate nothing wrong with the quality. Service, throughout the hotel, was second to none. Sad that a restaurant with such a great view of town was, for two of our three nights, empty.

Breakfast, if you were paying separately, was again too expensive for most. We had carefully chosen B&B, as most, if not all guests at breakfast, seemed to have done. We could not have wanted more in terms of selection and freshness. (Have seen reviews mentioning how long it takes to make toast. Overheard someone saying the same and next morning a new toaster appeared.) Told off by my wife for having Cava - two glasses - but how better to start the morning, whilst looking out over the city spread out below.

Now for the transport / distance from town.

Several of the earlier reviews gave us confidence that it was not the issue some have made out. Given the many positive points of this hotel don't let transport be a reason to reject this hotel. 

The suggestion of a taxi from airport to / from hotel is perhaps reasonable, especially if you have suitcases and the weather is hot. Can't confirm cost or what percentage of taxi drivers know the way, as we elected for the Aerobus from airport to town and the T2A bus on from Catalunya Square to the front of the hotel. However the T2A bus option will only work when the amusement park is open. (Saturday, Sunday, Public Holidays and 5 days out of 7 during July and August) Areobus is 10Euro return and the T2A 3Euro ech way.

If the T2A is not running, or if you don't have heavy suitcases and are arriving at the hotel during 'normal' hours then having arrived at Catalunya Square pop down to the metro and buy a T10 ticket (9.80Euro). This gives 10 trips on the city transport network. You can share the one ticket across a group, each person 'swiping' through in turn, using the same ticket and each journey is valid for 75 minutes across three modes of transport. This will get each member of your group from town to the door of the hotel for 98cents! Take the S1 or S2 train from Catalunya to Peu de Funicular. Take the connecting funicular tram to Vallvidrera Superior. Right outside the station is the 111 bus, which takes you to the door of the hotel. Sounds a trek, but we did the whole trip on one occasion in less than 35 mins. Allow 45. All for the one 98cent fare. A taxi or the T2A bus will take at least 30 mins.

The 111 bus runs every 30 mins. From the funicular it runs at 16 and 46 minutes past the hour. The only 'issue' is the last bus is 2118 so you need to leave town by 2045. From the hotel the 111 bus is again every 30 mins (think 55 and 25 past the hour). One evening we arrived back after the bus had finished and walked to the hotel. 30 mins with a very safe, fenced, sidewalk, albeit an up hill gradient all the way! The plus point being a view of the city. (No option of a taxi, unless you phone and book.)

There are a few reviews mentioning the decor. The hotel was restored in 2003. Yes - there are a few marks on the walls and the odd scratch on the floor, but my wife, who is adverse to anything 4* or less, was very happy. Perhaps the reason why the odd mark on the wall had not been painted was that the walls are polished plaster? Again, service from all staff was always with a smile and could not be faulted. Also don't worry about a 'mountain view' room. We looked across the mountains to the Pyrenees with the snow still visible. You can look at the city from breakfast / pool / terrace all day.",5,2013,05,08
28,By far not a 5 star,"Where to start. They started to lie to us saying there was no possibility to give us a room upgrade (lhw members)because there were fully booked.  In the room they gave us   were   2 letters, one for us offering a bottle of wine ( who was not there) and the other offering a massage to a lady named X. The room was nice and had a lovely bathroom but we could hear the wind howling through the window.  By checking on the internet we found out that there were rooms (for the upgrade) left on different booking sites.We mentioned it and  than to maked it up by giving  us their most beautiful suite with fantastic views over Barcelona. On our last day our flight back was late in the evening and they promissed us a late check-out; the day we left they gave us a letter that it was not possible because the room was booked ( they didn't offer a solution) So we were sitting on the terrace for many hours ( listening to the screaming from the amusement park )
Cleanliness: The room was cleaned like in a 2 star.  They forgot to change towels and the dirty towels were stil laying on the ground  at 5 o'clock in the evening  They didn't clean the bathroom.  They didn't  vacuum the carpet ,so it was really filty. they just made our bed. The toiletries were really basic (compared to casa fuster) and forgot to change the kleenex 
They have a gourgeous heated swimming pool and jaccuzi (nice big size)  and a lovely terrace overlooking Barcelona but the down side of it,is the amusement park next door. You hear the people screaming out loud and the roller coaster thunder all day. That is not my idea of a relaxt afternoon. Really regrettable because the view is just super. 
The lounge/bar area is very cosy but far too small. A capacity of 7 couples  able to  sit down. The other guest were really searching for a place to sitt. When the weather is sunny you can sit outside but with bad or cold weather (like in our case) it's really a problem.
Breakfast is not bad but certainly not a 5 star (compared with casa fuster hotel)The floor in the breakfast room was not cleaned.  One night we had a diner in the hotel and  it was nice food but we  think the price is much to high for what you get ( between 25 and 30 euro's for a fish plate) In town you can eat very good and much cheaper. If you don't have a car, you are almost obligated to stay because of the downtown trip. (25 minutes and ? euro's) It seems they are aware of it.
Leaving the hotel we received our bill and by checking it, they did put a amount from food and drinks  we didn't order. So they checked it and made the correction. The staff members were all very friendly and helpfull (that was 5 star)
Finaly the conclusion is that this is not a five star at all:  cleanliness, situation(amusement park) breakfast and to be honest the fact of the many things that hapened from the moment we arrived till the moment we left. 
We had a very good price for the room that's the reason I gave a 5 for value. Location (poor)because of the noise of the amusement park of course for the view it would be excellent. The service(poor) because of the dirty room and breakfast room not worth a 5 star but the service of the staff  was excellent.
So you see much mixed feelings.
Would I come back? No",2,2013,05,08
28,Romantic weekend away,"We always wanted to stay and finally got the chance.  Great hotel design and in the mountains over looking BCN. It feels like you are staying in a holiday home instead of a hotel! Really loved so many things about the hotel but would have changed a few things.  The room we had was large with a fab terrace with a good view but the room was tired and in need of refreshing of the walls, furniture and linens, the bed was super hard and there was a local dog that barked literally all night - for the 3 nights we were there. The staff was aware of the problem but could not do anything about it. BTW a car is recommended as taxis can get expensive.",4,2013,04,19
28,Good Hotel,"Our stay at the Gran Hotel La Florida was very good, the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly
and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel is situated high on a hill top overlooking Barcelona with amazing views.  The spa facilities are excellent. However the down side of this hotel is the price of any food you want to buy, for example; 18 euros for a chicken club sandwich & 19 euros for a hamburger. Also if you want to park your car at the hotel they will charge you 21 euros per night, I parked my car round the corner outside for free. If you want to use public transport there is a blue bus down to the city every half hour, travelling to the bottom of the hill is best and getting the Metro at Penitents station, however it is best to buy a metro ticket for 10 journeys as it will only cost 9.80 euros. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and although I did enjoy my stay, I thought that the state of the rooms were not quite up to scratch, for example, marks on the walls which normally I would not consider to be the case in a 5 star hotel.",4,2013,04,12
28,Beautiful,"I dont know why people had so many problems with this hotel. We were looking for a romantic place to stay and thankfully this place was rated it no 2 in romantic hotels in Barcelona, so came up in the search, otherwise would not have found it. I know the main attraction here is the View - but by god!! What a view - I think it paid for itself in terms of the experience - was so relaxing, calming and beautiful. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a romantic getway. It is located on top of Mount Tibidabo so is located around 15 min from the city. The service was good and their pool and food was great too. For entertainment I would head to the nearby Mirabelle restaurant and disco - try their paella it is to die for!
Rooms are comfortable and spacious with a separate living area and the hotel is quite fancy. If you are looking for a place to just relax, not really bothered about sightseeing and to spend some quality time with the family - this is a great place. there is an amusement park nearby if the kids want some entertainment.",4,2013,04,12
28,Lovely,We had a wonderful time. The hotel staff were brilliant and really looked after us. If I had to be picky the restaurant was a little bit over priced. The views are amazing from the hotel which is situated high up on a hill over looking Barcelona. It was great to come back and relax after a busy day. Xx,5,2013,04,12
28,Divine,"Our time at Gran Hotel La Florida was a piece of heaven.  It was so nice to step away from the busy city and nestle into the delightful space of Gran Hotel La Florida.  The views, ambience, and staff went beyond my expectations.  I have never met such an accommodating and authentically kind staff.  The service was impeccable.  The room was cozy, antiqued yet still modern.  They have an eye for detail at La Florida.  After staying here for a week, I felt refreshed, relaxed and glowing.  Thank you so much.  We will certainly return.",5,2013,04,09
28,Fabulous 5* overlooking Barcelona,"We had a wonderful stay here in early April 2013 for our wedding anniversary. It's beautiful. We're not used to 5* hotels so didn't quite know what to expect. Staff couldn't have done any more to help. Room was spotless & luxurious too. Buffet breakfast was everything you could need and more. Pool & Spa are amazing, as is the view.

Providing, you're ok with travelling in/out of city, it's well worth staying here. If you can afford taxis, go for it & enjoy the convenience (I think it's about 25 Euros each way depending on time of day/night, and about 35 Euros from the airport). 

If you're on more of a budget (as we were) then you just need to plan a bit more with public transport. It's accessible by a combo of train, funicular & bus - all of which are covered by a single journey on a t10 card. Here are our tips:

1. On arriving at the airport, IF you don't fancy public transport with luggage etc, then just get a cab straight to the Hotel - with hindsight, we would have done this - saves time that you can use in the pool instead!

2. As soon as you can, buy yourself a t10 card (for under 10 Euros you get 10 integrated journeys - i.e. 1 journey can be a mix of train/tube/bus/funicular lasting up to 1hr 15 mins). At the airport you can get these at the RENFE station (Terminal 2) and I think at Tabac shops. The t10 ticket is valid on the RENFE train to and from Barcelona airport to the city centre. It can also be used on the No. 46 Airport bus and the Airport NiteBus N17, but can't be used on the express Aerobus service.

3. If you want to take the budget route, there are a number of options to get to Placa de Catalunya (see 2 above re options).

4. Once at Placa de Catalunya, using your t10 take the FCG Line S1 or S2 (really frequent) to ""Peu de Funicular"" where you switch to the funicular ""Valvidvrera Inferior"" which takes you up to ""Valvidvrera Superior"". Turn right out of the station and wait at the bus stop for bus 111 which will drop you off outside of the hotel - but bear in mind, it's a half hourly service and the last bus is 9.15pm!  This section from Catalunya to the Hotel usually took us about 40-50 mins, and was our usual way of getting into & out of the centre.

5. Alternatively, if the Tibidabo theme park is open, you can take the Tibidabo bus from Placa de Catalunya - just under 3 Euros single (t10 not valid on this bus) and this gets you to the hotel too.  We didn't have this option on arriving as it was a Thursday in low season (park not open) but we were able to use this on departure on a Sunday - took about 25 mins.

6. Whatever you do, DON'T get the Tibidabo Funicular - it's a tourist trap - t10 cards are not valid and it costs 7½ Euros each.  Learn from our mistake! 

7. When coming back from town late at night, we used our t10 cards to get to Vall D'Hebron Metro, and then managed to hail a taxi on the main road junction there within 5 mins, even at 1am; taxi fare 13 Euros.

….hope this is useful.

The transport is either costly (Taxis) or cheap, but time consuming (t10 card). 

Either way, this hotel is SO worth it.",5,2013,04,08
28,High level of service with perfect view,"Perfect service, friendly staff. You need sunglasses for breakfast but the view is extraordinary - it is one of my top hotels.
Clean rooms, nice and high quality interior with perfect SPA - ideal place to stay and look down to Barcelona ",5,2013,04,06
28,Thank you Secret Escapes!,"We would not have found this hotel without Secret Escapes and we are so glad we did. It might seem a long way out from the centre of town but in so many ways it is worth it.As ever it is excellent people that make the difference and from the moment we were met outside the entrance we were made to feel special and very welcome.Check in was easy and then followed a tour of the hotel and a glass of Cava.Our room was spacious with a fantastic view of the city ,with a huge bed and a great bath room with plenty of large fluffy towels and nice shampoos and stuff.We ate on the terrace a couple of times and on both occasions the food was good and the views exceptional .The swimming pool was the best of any hotel I have ever stayed in,very long with a superb view at one end and most of the time we had it to ourselves..lovely!
There are three buses an hour into town,it takes about 25 minutes and costs 3 euros or a taxi is a little quicker but costs 18 euros or if you are feeling energetic try walking..it's a nice walk down,we didn't try it up and you feel you deserve a cava at the bottom.We loved this hotel in every way and we will be going back next Easter whether they want us or not...in fact I want to go back now and we only came home yesterday....",5,2013,04,01
28,Gran Florida Hotel - 4 night stay,"Fantastic hotel in an amazing setting.  Staff were all extremely helpful attentive.  We were given all the help necessary to find our way around all the sights and the hotel is up in the mountains, this proved invaluable.  The deluxe room we stayed in was charming, spacious and the mountain views were enchanting.    Would have no hesitation in recommending this delightful hotel and will definitely be returning soon!",5,2013,03,11
28,"Great location, great customer service","I stayed on different weekends in November 2012. The staff are wonderful, extremely helpful, kind and friendly; something that is quite rare these days even in 5-star establishments. The spa and pool area are fantastic. Breakfast excellent.

The location is divine for anyone who has been to Barcelona before and doesn't need to be in the centre. Just hire a car at the airport as it is only a short drive into town down the hill. The view from the hotel is magnificent.

The only minor issue I have is the fact that rooms of the same 'city view' category differ vastly in size, and you may end up with a delightfully spacious one, or with a rather cramped one. I had both and know which I prefer...

Go. Highly recommended!",4,2013,03,09
28,"Nice hotel, good service, location could be better","I have just returned from a long weekend with my husband at this hotel. It has a boutique feel and the service is good. There was sometimes a shortage of staff about, but the ones that were there were extremely friendly and attentive - they always remembered who we were, what room we were in etc. 

We stayed in room 404 which had two large windows and a small balcony - no great views though from this room, though undoubtedly many rooms will have wonderful views due to the location of the hotel on top of the mountain. 

The room was spacious, the bed was really large and comfortable with good quality linens,  I felt the bedroom itself was not quite up to 5 star standards, but was definitely a good 4 star room. The flooring was a little scratched and the walls a little patchy and crying out for some sort of point of interest on them, but these are small points really. 

The bathroom was very nice,  finished to a high standard and had wonderfully relaxing lighting which was perfect for a long soak in the bath. The toiletries provided were L'Occitane - lovely!

The hotel has a nice lounge bar which is lovely to relax in and a spa which we did not make use of as we spent all of our time sight seeing. We had room service one evening and this was quick and attentive and friendly. The food was of a good quality - we only had a snack really, but it was nice and they brought dessert to us half an hour later so that it was fresh - a nice touch which not every hotel thinks off (or certainly not without a second tray charge!)

The downside to this hotel was that it is so far out of the way. On average a ten min taxi ride from the centre of town which can be costly if you are to go out in the day and then again in the evening. I hear there may have been a free shuttle but nobody mentioned this to us. So do be prepared for costly taxi fares to get into the centre of the city. 

Once in Barcelona I would advise using the hop on, hop off bus tour ""Bus Touristique"". This enabled us to visit all of the sites we wanted to with ease, and the information given on the tour was really interesting as well. 

On the whole it felt probably more of a 4 star than a 5 star hotel as it definitely wasn't uber luxe, but it was certainly nice and provided a comfortable and welcoming base for a sight seeing trip. 

I would recommend it with the above points in mind, but personally would probably select somewhere more central should I visit Barcelona again.",4,2013,02,21
28,Always great La Florida,"I just came back from a short break at La Florida with my fiance.
It is the second time we come here and we had a great time again. The staff is always wonderful and they recognized us!! The hotel is in a great location and this time we didn't even go in town, we stayed in the whole 2 days; room service, great dinner at the restaurant.
Will come back a third time!",5,2013,02,01
28,Favourite Hotel - Ever,"My wife and I love Barcelona, we have visited many times and even travelled there once just for the day to get engaged. For my 40th birthday in October 2011 we decided to return. Instead of staying in the City itself, we wanted something special. And this is what we got.

The location is stunning. Anyone who doesn't like the location must have rocks for brains. It is stunning, high in the mountains, so you have 'escaped' but with an amazing view of the City. 

We were desperate to return and so we went back in October 2012. We were so lucky to be upgraded to the Miramar suite - breathtaking views. We just sat watching the day turn to night, the lights of Barcelona viewed from the hotel will stay with me forever. Drinking vintage champagne added to the ambience - amazing

The pool is gorgeous, the lobby Lounge amazing with a fantastic 'waterfall'.

The staff are attentive but not intrusive. Spot on.

As we have had a grim Winter, I knew just what we needed to cheer us up. A couple of days back in Barcelona at this amazing hotel. So in March we head back for our 3rd visit. I'm sure it won't be our last. If you're a romantic, you'll love this place. Just relax and take it all in. Love it, love it, love it!",5,2013,01,26
28,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at...,"My fiance and I stayed at this hotel in June 2012 and I have been meaning to write a review ever since.  We have traveled quite a bit throughout the US, the Caribbean and Europe and I have to say that this was far and away one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  On this particular trip, we stayed a few days in the heart of Barcelona, drove to France and then came back to Barcelona for a few days which was when we stayed at the Gran Hotel. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately by the staff who offered us champagne while they checked us in.  We were then given a tour of the hotel, during which we mentioned that we were on this trip to celebrate our recent engagement.  Within a half hour of getting to our room, the receptionist who had given us the tour hand delivered a complementary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate! 

Our room was absolutely amazing and impeccably clean.  We had a view of the entire city (the hotel is situated on top of a hill/mountain), a bathroom covered in marble, plush bathrobes and the biggest shower I've ever seen.  We spent the rest of the day swimming in the indoor/outdoor pool (which was spotless) and eating a fabulous dinner on the pool balcony overlooking the city.  

Yes, the hotel is quite far from the heart of the city but definitely worth staying for the incredible views, fabulous service and luxurious feel of the rooms.  As a first time traveler to Barcelona, I would actually recommend staying a few nights near the hustle and bustle of La Rambla and then a few nights here.",5,2013,01,15
28,Thank you,"My girlfriend and I planned a trip to this great city in March of this year, upon arrival we were greeted and shown to our room which could only be described as perfect, the rooms were big and the amenities provided were more than enough. The view from the room could only be described as spectacular, we had booked a room with a view of the city. The amenities of the hotel were also of a very high standard, with an excellent spa and gym, and the restaurant being of a very high standard. I have seen reviews stating how the distance between the town is very far, to which I would agree however if you are willing to travel this hotel is more than worth it!!!!!!",5,2013,01,01
28,Nice hotel but far from city,"I stayed at this hotel with my family on a business trip. There was not much on site for my son to be entertained with... No garden or anything. The view was great though... Rooms were ok sized, food was average. The service was great too... The second day we stayed there we got stuck in the city due to bad weather (as the hotel is up a hill and roads were closed)... This was unexpected bad weather and the hotel helped arrange a hotel for me in the city to stay the night... Although i had to pay for it myself...
It was an ok stay... Would be good for a romantic getaway and if you plan to use taxis a lot.",3,2012,12,28
28,The best hotel view of Barcelona. Unmissable.,"Great hotel, beautiful weather. An infinity swimming pool which my son and wife loved. Great breakfasts as well. Room service was a bit slow though. The downsides are the hotel is located a good 20 minutes from the city centre but there were complimentary minbuses during the day. At night you need to take a taxi though. There is a wonderful amusement park further along the mountain side which is perfect for kids. Dinner was a bit formal but good though quite pricey. Ovrall I really enjoyed the hotel but would also recommend splitting your stay in Barcelona to take advantage of the town centre and its nightlife. I stayed in the Ritz afterwards. (See my other reviews)",5,2012,12,09
28,Stunning views,"Having stayed three nights on business at this hotel, I would very much like to visit again. My room had a stunning view which I was really able to appreciate on the last morning when the sun came out. The air up on this mountain is life invigorating and so fresh, I wished I'd had more free time to enjoy it. Staff are friendly and attentive whilst staying professional. The room itself was spacious and comforable and the pillows were of a high quaility as was the bed. My friends room had an outside hot tub but the weather was a bit too wet to enjoy it. Also, lovely Christmas decorations made the whold experience a delight.",5,2012,12,03
28,Get a Terasse room,"The hotel is nice and service good, probably a bit worse than I would expect from a Leading Hotel of the World hotel. BUT, the views if get a good room are priceless. All of Barcelona and the sea right in front of you. Location for sightseeing not optimal.",4,2012,11,28
28,"Great Hotel, Slightly poor experience","First off, this is a superb Hotel, with great facilities and location (if you like a view). Generally very attentive staff.
I arrived early and they offered me a courtesy drink whilst awaiting my room which was nice. They were excessively keen to valet park the car which was less nice as I had to organise my bags (last night of a weeks golfing trip). I felt a bit harrassed on this point. I was given a tour of the Hotel which was nice. On check-in I had been told that the room I had booked (with big picture windows) was not available so they had upgraded me. Unfortunately to a suite that had a nice view of trees with a little bit of Barcelona in between. They did not pick up on my comment at check-in that the view was what I had come for! On the weekend there is a bus direct to the Plaza de Catalunya and a Taxi back cost ~20Euros. The swimming pool is very nice and the outdoor one is stunning. There is a large Jacuzzi style pool.
On check-out I was left to wait for 15 minutes (big difference from the valet harassment the day before!) and then discovered the valet charge (20 euros - to be expected) and also a spa charge (10 euros per use of the Jacuzzi !!) and an admonishment for not having booked it first! In the tour of the Hotel they had declined to tell me either about the pre-booking requirement or the charge. This did leave a bit of a bitter taste to what should have been a superb stay.
In summary - superb building, great views if in rooms above 1st floor, expect extra charge creep.",4,2012,11,16
28,Quiet Hotel,"The hotel is on top of Tibedabo and the view of Barcelona is fabulous.  Our  room was huge as was the bathroom.  Its quite a long way into the city and the only way back at night is by taxi.
The breakfast was ok but the evening meals were poorly cooked and not much choice, however, the staff were so friendly and nothing was any trouble.
As Spain was on a general strike the day we were to return to UK, we had to hire a private car to take us to the airport it cost 100 Euro which was a bit of a downer for our three day break.",4,2012,11,15
28,Disappointed!!!,"Yes, the hotel has a beautiful view over the city, but after that, it has little to entice you to go back. It may be fine for a conference, when you are at meetings all day and then take an organized trip into the city for dinner, but for a couple or two just going there to primarilly see the city, it is much too far from the city attractions. The problem is compunded by the fact that there is also nothing near the hotel such as another restaurant or stores. 
So the location is bad, but what about the service and the food in the hotel. We booked a dinner reservation in the main dining room the first night we got there. The service was awful and the food was not much better. We got so upset with both that we eventually left without eating and never went back even though we made the mistake of booking a room at this hotel for 4 nights. 
There is no alternate dining location in the evening other than the outdoor terrace, which is OK if the weather is nice, but the menu is limited. You can also eat in the lobby bar, if you don't mind eating off of coffee tables. The breakfast arrangement is also awful. They only offer a buffet and you can't sit in the breakfast room, if you don't want the buffet. You can go to the outdoor area if the weather is OK, but if it is not, they frown on letting you sit inside.
The rooms are nice, but don't let them offer you the Japanese Suite unless you want that decor. Our room was not ready when we got there so they said they would ""upgrade"" us to that suite. We refused it when we saw it because we did not like the decor and it looked out onto the roof of another part of the hotel. I would not take that room even if they gave it to me for nothing - well maybe I would if it was only for one night.
Most of the staff are congenial and quite willing to help, but I believe the place is just poorly managed and organized. I am not in the hotel business, but I have travelled enough to know what to expect and I certainly expected a better experience than what my wife and I got from this hotel. If you are going to Barcelona for a vacation to see the city and the attractions it offers, you will do yourselves a favor by staying closer to the city in a hotel that offers a much better location and an overall more acceptable experience.",2,2012,11,07
28,Stunning views!,"Amazing hotel right at the top of Tibedabo in Barcelona with stunning views of Barcelona and the Mediterranean beyond. Arguably the best views of any hotel in Barcelona. Great breakfast buffet with complimentary champagne. Friendly staff and great cocktail bar. Incredibly friendly staff, we got upgraded to a suite overlooking the pool. Great hotel with great service and a real classic five-star!

Now, just a few small negatives: You absolutely need a car to stay at this hotel, the bus service is sporadic and taxis will get expensive if you travel into central Barcelona twice a day. On the flip side renting a car in Barcelona is cheap and driving is easy so really didn't suffer from that. They also have valet parking at the hotel. The hotel is not exactly run-down but is starting to show needs of a bit of polishing all around. Also, on Saturday night there was a wedding with dinner and music by the pool area and a drinks reception in the lobby. That was OK by us as we actually enjoyed checking out the party and the guests from a safe distance, but if you are easily disturbed or have small children with you this probably wouldn't have been great.

All in all really enjoyed it, for the price we enjoyed incredible standards with just a few small drawbacks.

Tip: Continue the road up from the hotel and check out the old fairground featured in the movie ""Vicky Christina Barcelona""!",4,2012,10,26
28,The most fabulous view of Barcelona,"It sits up on the mountain overlooking all of Barcelona - an amazing view.  We also had a view of the church that sits on Tibidabo and it was spectacular.  It is about 20 minute ride from town, but buses will take you down or a cab ride is about 15 to 20 Euro's, depending on how far you want to go. After a full day in the city it was great to get back up to the hotel, overlook the city and just relax.  The restaurant has a delicious menu and the food was prepared to perfection. It is peaceful, relaxing and the service and the food is amazing.  The staff is most helpful to provide you with information, tickets to attractions or anything else you may need.",5,2012,10,08
28,Good but cracks showing...,"Much has been said about this hotel's location and its view. The view is amazing but it does mean it is away from the city center. Whether you do by taxi (20€), bus+funicular+metro, or drive yourself, it will take about 30 min. If you are visiting the city for the first time, I'd say it might be more convenient to stay on the center. However, if you are looking for a special location to enjoy the city from and are not on a tight schedule, then dont let the distance steer you away from this unique hotel.

My problem with this hotel, and the reason I was tempted to give an ""average"" rating, is that there were a couple of things I simply would not have expected in a 5-star hotel. First, when I called the reservation before I booked the trip, the guy who answered took my number and said he'll call back in five minutes but it never happened. Then, I emailed to the reservation address but was explained later that no one works in Reservation over the weekend and the email is not even checked.  

Also, although I booked two rooms they only had the record for one when I arrived. The issue was quickly resolved but  it, along with the proficiency of the staff, made me feeling a bit unsure of their operations.

The other area that is showing cracks, perhaps literally, is the facility itself. Consider this: the air conditioning didn't work so I had to call and they had to do several things before they finally changed something in the room to restore it. In the shower, something that would normally covet the drain was missing, exposing the disgusting piping underneath. I reported this but it wasn't during my three day stay. The shower faucet was missing a screw cap. The toilet seat was missing a pad underneath and kept drifting sideways. 

I think this may well have been an unfortunate combination of typical issues but it does show that the maintenance perhaps needs to be improved.

So overall, this hotel doesn't even begin to compete with impeccable service and perfectly maintained rooms you  find in the best 5-star hotels in BCN. However, it's unique location  combined with charming style of the facility does provide a comfortable place to enjoy Barcelona from. Plus, when you consider the fact that hotel rates in BCN have risen drastically in the last several  years and there are a lot of bad 4-star hotels in the center charging the same as this hotel, this does as good choice.",4,2012,10,07
28,An amazing view overlooking all of Barcelona with an excellent service.,"I booked a big sea view room with a terrace which has an amazing view and tanning beds. The food is amazing. The hotel is about 25 min from city centre, bur there's a bus at the hotel door to take you there. The staff is very helpful.
It is definitely worth it. ",5,2012,10,05
28,Charming hotel with superb staffs,"My husband and I had just stayed at Hotel Florida for 4 nights to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We chose the hotel based on our friends' recommendations and we were impressed!

The hotel is extremely charming and luxurious. As we are quite used to the small/tired looking 5-star hotel rooms in Europe, Hotel Florida came as a very nice surprise. We booked a city view room (which really is a suite) has a breath-taking view of the city as well as the near-by church. The room has very spacious bathroom, living/bed rooms and impressive high-ceiling. We also loved sitting in the hotel's garden terrance enjoying our morning latte and bathing in the warm Oct sunshine. 

Staff is another highlight of the hotel. Front desk receptionists, Anna and Lisa are extremely helpful. Both of them often went out of their ways to help us (booking restaurants, finding train schedule, even showing us the way to take the metro by riding with us on the bus). We left our power charges at home so had to constantly ask the ladies to help charing our iphones and blackberries. They have always helped with smiles. The tapa restuarant suggested by Anna was one of the best places we have experienced in Barcelona. Thank you so much!

A quick tip for the future travelers:
-Location is hotel Florida's strength as well as weakness (that's why we gave it 4 stars instead of 5). The hotel is located on top of a mountain. While it's lovely for travelers who wish to get away from the city, it's not the most convenient if it's your first time in Barcelona. We are now staying at our second hotel, which is in the city center. We wish that we have stayed at city center first then at Hotel Florida second. It will allow us to enjoy Hotel Florida even more and we won't feel pressured to go down to the city every day. That said, it will only cost c.20Euro to go to city center by taxi and c.2-3Euro by cable car/metro. Not a big deal at all.

Lastly, just a few tips for the hotel mgmt to improve further:
-Breakfast. It was the same offering every single day. I wish that the mgmt will consider changing things up a little and making it more exciting.
-Pillows. Way too soft. I had to use two just to get by. Would be great if the hotel can offer better pillow selections. 
-DVD player. We didn't have a DVD player in our room. While it's very nice of the staff to arranged a seperate TV/DVD machines to be sent to our room, the image quality and sound system were quite poor. For 5-star hotels now, i believe that it's generally expected a good DVD system is installed in each room.

Above all, I wish to say that Hotel Florida is one of the best hotels we stayed in Europe. We certainly look forward to return in the future years.

28,Food and beverage is an outrageously poor value.,We ordered pasta for room service that was about four ravioli for 18 euros.  Just a tasting not an entree.  We had the same problem with every meal.  This has been written about by other critics of the hotel.   For sure they have cost cutting situation in the hotel that is not in the best interest of the guests.  We took this up with the hotel by bringing the plates to the front desk.  It was comical.,3,2012,09,27
28,Nice but overpriced,"The hotel is very nice and their staff are friendly and accommodating but they charge over $300 US per night and Spain is going over a cliff financially.  The rooms have nice views and some have terraces and or balconies, and the hotel has an amazing location atop a mountain.  

They charged me for four nights despite only staying three and telling them at check in I was leaving in three nights.  There is nothing in the area, and while you can run or walk in the area their gym was lacking for a Leading Hotel of the World.  Several pieces of equipment did not work and they had no newspaper delivery.  

Charming but a bit over priced and limited unless you are sightseeing all day every day.",4,2012,09,24
28,Fantastic Views,"We throughly enjoyed our five night break way to Barcelona. We couldn't fault the hotel in any way. The staff were all friendly yet professional and the food, drinks and were lovely. The views of the city were amazing. We would recommend this hotel for those in need of a restful peaceful holiday. There is a theme park next door but to be honest you hardly notice it so don't let that deter you from staying here. We hope to return one day :-)",5,2012,09,24
28,A handicapped so-called 5-star hotel that profits a lot from its view.,"We had booked 4 overnight stays in their much-coveted terrace suite, which turned out to be characterised by an amazing private 25 m2 terrace with a view of all of Barcelona  as well as the coast line. 
The suite is large, but it feels as if they have forgotten to put furniture in there, as there is only a bed, two chairs, a broken mini-bar and an old television that has no HDMI socket. 

The bathroom is large and nice, but just like so much else at this hotel, it is handicapped by something as simple as the towel racks not being screwed in properly, which means that they are drooping, and if you attempt to hang a towel on them, they fall out of the wall. In some places, the screw had been replaced by a plastic ""strip"".

The light in the suite has resistive faults in the wiring, which means that it had a life of its own and turned on and off by itself. If someone walked across the floor in the room above ours, we had a ""strobe""-like light show in our room.

The restaurant tries to be a nice gourmet restaurant, but unfortunately, only the prices are at gourmet level (EUR 28 for 2 scallops), as the quality and the selection are completely unacceptable. Since you are living far away from everything, the food has to be top notch, as you have no alternatives, unless you want to go on a 20-30-minute taxi ride.

I am usually very fond of Americans, but the US is a large country, and unfortunately, 20 of the tiresome kind were staying at the hotel, new rich Americans who thought they could act as if they owned the whole world. They partied loudly all night like it was 1999. Even though the hotel staff asked them several times to keep it down, they simply turned up the volume, and this continued all night. If all Americans acted like that, it would be more understandable why half the population of the Earth sincerely hate Americans. Unfortunately, this scenario meant that we had no quiet or breathing space during the first night at this establishment. 

The hotel staff had forgotten to inform us that they were holding a large wedding on Saturday, so when we found out ourselves, I gave their hotel manager 10 minutes to find us a new 5-star hotel and said that I had no intention of paying for the night we had stayed there. I obviously paid for food and beverages, fair is fair, even though the food was unacceptable.

The spa area was also rather measly, and the treatments offered are characterised by the fact that we are once again dealing with cosmetologists who simply want to promote various spa products instead of offering some enjoyable massage that you can actually feel. 
The pool area and the associated facilities are, just like the rest of the hotel, close to being decrepit, so I will spend no more time writing about this.

The view is worth 5 giant stars, but because there are problems with pretty much everything else, I will give a total of 2 stars, and I hope that I have made very clear that I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2012,09,18
28,A different prespective of Barcelona,"Barcelona has always been one of our favourite European cities and this time we chose a different environment for our accommodation, and what a good move it was!  The view from the hotel which is perched +500m up at the Tibidabo Hill, is second to none.  Try to get a room with a City View, but even if you don't, you could always have a drink at their terrace bar anytime of the day, and you will be rewarded with one of the most beautiful sights of Barcelona.  Our favourite time to go to the terrace bar was around 7:30pm.  We would order a couple glasses of Cava and then settle in on one of those double-size sun-beds and just enjoy the sunset with the city lights coming alive at the tip of our toes.  So romantic!  

We ate at their restaurant l'Orangerie a couple times and both experiences were good.  The food was delicious and innovative, and the price we paid was well worth the money (mind you we live in Geneva, so are used to high food prices).  A 3-course meal with a bottle of wine and sparkling water, for 2 persons came to approx. EUR160.  The portion of the appetizer was big but the main course was just right.  The restaurant was not big so advance booking is highly recommended.  One night we had no reservation and could only dine at the terrace bar.  We ordered burger, fries and salad and the meal was excellent, and a good alternative for those who want to save some money on dinner .  The only thing that kind of ruined the ambience at the l'Orangerie was the squeaky shoes that the servers were wearing.  Perhaps management could look into that.  Breakfast was ordinary with no great variety, and service could be slow sometimes.

I wanted to try the massage at the Spa but it was almost always full.  As we wanted to go out in the afternoons, the only option for me was in the early mornings.  Sadly, the Spa did not offer earlier appointments than 10am, and I think they also close quite early.  So, it's either you miss breakfast, or you would have to sacrifice an afternoon not going out, so you could have your 2hrs appointment.  The pool seemed great and fun, but my husband said the toilet near the pool was filthy.  

The room we were allocated was on the first floor with a side-view to the city (Rm 117).  It had a small balcony but since it was on the first floor, the noise from the street below could be disturbing (ie. buses and sometimes children shouting on their way to the Tibidabo Amusement Park). There was also lack of privacy in the balcony when you are on the first floor.  One early afternoon we were having a drink on our balcony, and 2 staff were arranging tables below in the terrace area, I guess we were talking and they heard us and just kept looking at us.  Not sure if that was the right gesture at a 5-stars establishment... We did try to ask for a higher floor room but it was not possible.  The mini-bar was also warm in the first 2 days but we had no trouble bringing back cold drinks from the bar to our room to enjoy.  Other than that, the room was spacious and clean, and the bedding was very comfortable.  The bathroom was definitely 5 stars and we were impressed with the big shower room and the expensive marble furnishing.  It was also a good idea to have ""his and hers"" separate closets.

Many people talked about the inconvenience of getting into town, which we had no trouble at all.  We knew the hotel is quite some distance from downtown, but if you do your homework and ask the hotel for information, it is very manageable.  It is simple as 123, 1 you take the Air-conditioned Mini-bus no. 111 across the hotel's entrance for a 10mins ride to the Funicular Station, 2 you take the funicular that runs approx. every 5-10mins to the terminus, and 3 you take the direct train (S1 or S2) underneath the Funicular Station to the Pl. de Catalunya and it's done.  If you have good timing, the whole journey to downtown takes around 30mins max.  It's no different than traveling within London or Paris on a normal day.  You come back the same way but just reverse direction.  The last Mini-bus leaves the Funicular Station at around 9pm going back to the hotel.  How hard is that?  If you cannot do this, there are plenty of taxis in town to take you back to the hotel.  Nevertheless, do keep in mind it can be hard to hire a taxi to go down.  The day we were to leave, we asked the hotel 2hrs in advance to book us a taxi at 2:30pm to the airport.  We waited for more than 20mins and there was no taxi for us.  Within those 20mins, we could see other hotel guests also anxiously trying to get taxis, and we were at one point so scared that we would miss our flight!  That was a Thursday afternoon and not during rush hour, so my advice is to book the taxi early and remind the reception, if you want to go home on time.

Another thing that made the hotel special was actually the Tibidabo Amusement Park next door.  We didn't pay the EUR28.50 admission to go into the ride area (think it's a bit much because there were only a few interesting rides there), but had fun just walking around the SkyWalk Area and ate cotton candy.  It really reminded us of old times, and again there was a viewing platform where you have a great view of Barcelona and its ports.  From the park, you could also see the hotel not far from the distance, and I think it looked even more magnificent from the park than close up.  The old church at the entrance of the park was also grand and especially beautiful when it was lit up at night.  We saw a lot of cyclists climbing to the top of Tibidabo, and if you prefer to jog in the nature than at the treadmills in the hotel gym, this would be an excellent choice.

To sum it up, we really had a great time staying the 5days at the Gran Hotel La Florida despite a couple of imperfections.  The hotel is romantic, relaxing, good value for the money and built in one of the most beautiful locations in Barcelona.  There is definitely room for improvement for the service standards, but this is Spain/Catalan and hard to compare with the same standards one might receive in other 5-Stars establishments in the Far East or SE Asia, for example.  If you have broken your wallet before at other downtown/waterfront hotels just paying for the location (and probably not getting the 5-Stars treatment), I urge you to try the Gran Hotel La Florida next time.",4,2012,09,16
28,Peaceful elegance,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay! Terrific though small spa, glamorous pool perched on the mountainside, views of the city lights, charming kittens on the property, old-world but comfortably so.  A nice alternative to noisy, hot downtown. We will return!",4,2012,09,08
28,"Great accommodations, best city views.","Came to the Hotel thru an American Express Fine Hotels deal, and it was just as described, a Fine Hotel. Probably the best views of the city, curvy roads to get to it, but that was part of the experience. Food was good, pool was great, views were outstanding. The rooms (we reserved two, one upgraded) were ok, again great views from the windows, but have been in superior rooms with Amex while in Cannes and Monaco. Breakfast is included as well as a credit for the spa which is booked solid. However Amex had told me that the credit could be applied towards dinner, but the staff in the hotel said the credit is only for the spa, which was booked? Didn't make sense. The only time available is Friday at 10 and 11 am, but then I don't get to see the city(?). Didn't come to Barcelona for the spa, so I guess the credits will go to waste, must be just a gimmick. We had a bottle of champagne in one of the rooms which was a nice touch, and the staff has been very helpful. Only disappointment has been with the spa ""credits"". Will report again this Saturday when we depart. So far a solid 4 and a half stars.",5,2012,09,05
28,Nice,"Liked it,but 5Star,get serious ,very understaffed ,all in all,best views anywhere,you get what you pay for,would stay in town next time. Need rental car to get around,unless you like taking the,,,,,,,Bus!",4,2012,09,03
28,Still an amazing hotel,"Although there are more and more high end hotels in Barcelona, La Gran Florida is still a unique hotel, if only because of its location. It is tricky to get to (although a city bus strays right outside the hotel) but we rented a car (valet parking, no other option, €20 a day) and the GPS found the hotel without any problem. We were offered a glass of complementary champagne upon check. We got upgraded to a suite which was amazing, but I think standard rooms are specious, very nice in room amenities, incomparable views. Very quiet room and thankfully proper black out curtains as the sun is bright in the morning. There is a nice breakfast buffet, which we enjoyed poolside (€25 pp). The pool was one of the highlights of the property. It is designed so that some swimmers can do laps while other can play in a shallow area. Overall a beautiful property. May be not somewhere I would choose for a business trip but great if you are looking for a luxurious property away from the crowds for a short stay.",5,2012,08,31
28,Favourite hotel in Europe!,"I first visited this hotel 6 years ago and was worried I would be disappointed on this return trip - I wasn't!  If anything the place has got better. Stunning building, stunning views, exquisite decor, elegant surroundings - the flower arrangements, etc are just beautiful.  The place is an oasis of calm elegance but not stuffy in any way.  Even the cheapest rooms are large and have amazing views.  It is near the top of the mountain and you have to pay for taxis if you're going up and down to the City but if you've seen Barcelona then you won't want to leave this hotel except for a day or so. Slightly disappointed in the evening restaurant food, we thought the standard would have been higher but the service is exceptional and the snacks, lunches, tapas are excellent. We ate casually after the first night in the restaurant.  If we had been on our own we would have eaten in the restaurant again but others in our party didn't want to eat formally.  Great pool and spa. Staff all great.",5,2012,08,24
28,Excellent views Good hotel,"Excellent views of Barcelona make this hotel so beautiful.Well appointed spacious room.
Good service but very difficult to communicate with some members of the staff.
Breakfast was very good BUT the toaster is ridiculous  2 slices take 10 minutes to cook.So if you are waiting to use the machine Breakfast will be over before it is your turn. Lovely Cava for breakfast with choice of juices washed it all down.
Good value hotel accomodation only a 10 minute bus ride to Playa Catalunya 2.80 euros one way
Staying here made it feel like you were no where near a major city.
We used a taxi from the airport and were ripped off by the driver.Should really be 25 euros at most
Better to use the Aerobus for 9 euro return to the centre Playa catalunya Then the T2A bus to Timbadao. Sounds hard work but was really easy and much better than suffering a ""Ayrton Senna"" type taxi ride.Bus every 20 mins from the square Opposite corner to Apple store.
The Hotel has  good spa facilities and a very cold swimming pool but good for you on a cold day
Free Wifi the whole hotel makes email easy.Speed reasonable but you have to keep logging in and out.
Restaurant very slow service but it is Spain,Cava served while you wait.
Mini bar and bar similar to other hotels of this type.San Miguel 5.5 euros Bottle of cava 25 euros 
Coke 5.25 euros 

The amusement park nearby was very popular and was a little noisy while sunbathing 
Certainly we will go back here next time I go to Barcelona",4,2012,08,23
28,Not a 5 star experience,"Great location and well serviced by public transport 5 days of the week.  So disapointed by my stay in this hotel, I would sum it up with one phrase 'not enough'.  Not enough staff, sun beds or food choice.  For €28 per person for breakfast I was expecting amazing, what we got was ants on the fruit plate and rotten nectarines.  Food choices were limited and there was just not enough staff, for example I wanted to eat in their restaurant one evening, I had not booked a table but as there were less than 50% of the tables occupied I did not expect that to be a problem, it was and the reason was not enough waiting staff.  I was there for 5 nights and there was never enough sun beds on their terrace for hotel guests, some mornings not enough towels and overall just not a 5 star experience.",3,2012,08,23
28,BIRD'S EYE VIEW,"Excellent location with a magnificent view of the city of Barcelona , and not only! You can feel it is a Grand Hotel from the moment you  arrive to the moment that you check out! I slept in the suite at the 6th floor and I was impressed by the bed!!Not only beautiful in design but also I experienced a unique sleep! Sleeping on the clouds at the top of Barcelona! Dinner at the hotel restaurant which offered the new summer menu with fresh and invigorating tastes. Too bad, the weather didnt help! Really intend to go back to try also the spa.",5,2012,08,20
28,Wonderful - if it is what you want!,"The cooling breezes rustling through the pine trees; the location high above the city; the gourmet restaurant (which is excellent value for money);the traditional decor - are all wonderful - if you aren't looking for an inexpensive modern hotel in the heart of the city. The service is good. The snack menu is adequate and would be improved by the addition of  a range of tapas but this isn't enough to detract from the overall experience.

It's not cheap and you get what you pay for but it's definitely worth making sure that you want to buy what they are selling.

",5,2012,08,06
28,Stunning views of the city,"This was my first time to this side of Barcelona. Although the distance from the hotel to the city was quite far, the location was beautiful - overlooking the city and the sea. To get to the city, you need to travel by bus or on foot to the nearest town and then get a cable car down to the main square. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you were looking for a quiet, relaxing weekend with the girls or with the significant other - the hotel has fabulous spa facilities and is very tranquil.",4,2012,08,03
28,Excellent Rating As Long As You Like Quiet (we did),"My daughter and I loved this hotel.  It sits up high atop a mountain overlooking Barcelona.  The view from your hotel balcony at night is breath taking. They offer a free shuttle to town at certain times, we missed it and had to take a taxi back (about 20 euro, not cheap.) Nonetheless, we prefer to be away from the noise and enjoyed the quiet retreat and spectacular views from our truly beautiful room/balcony.  Pool was great, very relaxing and again, million dollar views.  If you stay here, keep in mind that you have to eat at their restaurant - nothing else available within walking distance... croquettes were to die for - great wine, cheese & olives.  Apparently the FC Barcelona  team stays or have stayed at this hotel - my daughter was on the look out for a Messi sighting!",4,2012,07,20
28,Nice hotel but no attention to detail,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July.

Our overall impression was that the hotel has a lot of potential but it is somewhat lacking in the smaller attention to detail.

To summarise the good things were as follows:

- Beautiful views of Barcelona and away from the hustle and bustle
- Lovely spa and swimming pool area with plenty of towels available
- Loved the L'Occocitane complimentary products in room
- Bathrobes in room

The not so good aspects were this:

- Even with the direct bus (that only runs in the summer months) the hotel is quite far from town and on the one occasion when we did get the bus, funnicular and metro it took nearly an hour each way!
-  Breakfast is so ridiculously overpriced we didn't even bother trying it as we were told it was 28 euros per person
- When I went to use the spa area on Wednesday evening both the steam room and the sauna were not on.
- When I used the steam room on Thursday a guest had left some rubbish behind - this was still there on Friday evening
- My husband had goggles and swam underneath the water in the swimming pool - he said that around the jet water areas there was some rubbish that had built up.
- 3 dirty glasses were left behind the sofa in the bar lounge area that were visible from the pool.  These were there from Wednesday to Friday - so eventually we handed them in to the bar staff.
- The bathroom in our room had peeling and cracking paint around the ceiling edges as if there had been a water leak from the bathroom in the room above.
- With the turndown service there was not even a complimentary chocolate or a bottle of water provided which I would have thought be standard if you're providing a turndown service.
- The staff weren't particularly friendly or helpful.  For example when I ordered a cafe latte at the bar I got a hot chocolate instead.  When I said to the waitress that I didn't want chocolate but coffee she replied by saying that she's French and she knows what a cafe latte is.  I then explained to her that a cafe latte is not the same as chocolate chaude - at which point she murmured something about the menu being confusing before replacing my drink.  When it came to paying the bill they still tried to charge me the higher price of 6 euro which was for the hot chocolate.

Overall it may sound like I'm nit picking but I do feel that the above points have reduced the enjoyment of our stay and for that reason I would not go back to stay at this hotel again.",3,2012,07,14
28,Lovely hotel!,"Really lovely,nice and small and quiet,friendly welcome with a glass of bubbly,but service at breakfast was mixed,cold at times.

Hotel rooms are large and well appointed,lovely L'Occitane products,huge shower,clean and lovely pool,which is inside and out,sunbeds single and double available.

Breakfast had a good selection plus cava,nice fruit and pastries plus eggs etc,you could ask for fresh cooked omelettes,fried eggs etc,and I loved the waffles!

Only downside is the trip down into the centre,but if you allow time and money for this,plus this means location is remote and quiet (good things!) then it's fine!  Buses go every half hour into centre,2.80 e single,T2A,when park is open plus if not the Bus Barri 111 goes from the park to funicular to train,all cheap and easy!Skywalk is open at times when park is shut so bus 111 runs then,and is reliable etc.If not,taxi is max 20e from hotel and they are easy to find,make sure you ask for straight direct route from city to hotel.

Is lovely,recommend it and I would stay there again in a shot!

Enjoy!",4,2012,07,12
28,"A room with a view, and that's about it!","We booked an ocean view room and we had a great view. We arrived early for check in, they said the room would be ready in about 3 hours,which we expected, we had planned on using the spa. However nothing was working, the hot tub was closed, the steam room and suan was not on. 6 hours later our room was ready,once we were in the room we found it to be very worn , not what you woud expect at this level of a hotel.At check in we my dinner reservation in their restaurant, we went down for dinner ,they did not have our reservation, the staff was not friendly, they where serving dinner on the terrace, however  they seated us in side in the empty restaurant. The service was bad,the food was even worst and over priced. This is not a 5 start hotel.",2,2012,07,12
28,Not worth the price.  You can go see the view for free.,"There was nothing five star about this place.  The front reception seemed to always have to run around to get anything done.  We waited hours for our room to be ready.  The heated pool was freezing in July.  The spa area was not working when we arrived.  We had to go tell reception and it seemed like they did send someone to turn on the steam and sauna.  Its not a true attended to spa area.  It's a hotel with a steam and sauna.  

The room was okay.  Seemed a bit worn for what was suppose to be five star but the view was amazing.  The only place you can walk to is a cathedral and an old amusement park.  So the hotel is reallly your only option for food.  The fine dining restaurant was a waste of our money.  

We made reservations that was confirmed twice by the hotel and the restaurant could not find any record.  The place was empty since we went early getting a seat was not a problem there was noone there.  We asked to sit outside and was denied because they where all reserved.  We where placed inside the dining room as the only people eating there.  What really got us was that another couple asked for a table outside and they went and retrieved one and set up for them.  The wait staff seemed overwhelmed with only a few tables to attend to that night.  The food was not worth the money we spent.",1,2012,07,12
28,"LUXE, LUXE AND LUXE","I was one day at this hotel and the experience was perfect. 
Welcome with coffe or cava, very nice spa and very very big rooms and bed. 
Nice views to Barcelona city.
Drinks or meat are very expensive, but it's what you can expect at this kind of hotels. 
18 Eur for an Hamburger is too much.",5,2012,07,10
28,Price for food and beverages is ridiculously high,"I love this hotel.
Located 15mns outside Barcelona, amazing sighseeing, nice rooms, nice pool, nice and relaxing garden.
BUT, the hotel is outrageously taking advantage of its location oustide Bracelona where there is no restaurant nearby, to overprice the food and beverages.

You really feel like you are trapped and I really dislike this feeling !

Very much a pity as the place is gorgeous if ones want to be outside but close to the city !",3,2012,07,07
28,Lazy service' do not go with a small child,"We arrived about 4pm - our room was not ready - they said it will be in about 45mins. After 45 mins I asked if we can move in a new girl in reception told me that we have to wait another 45mins.. Finally when I asked for hotel manager they by miracle found us a room - and it was 7pm.. 3h waiting for room in a 5* hotel?? When we've entered the room there were no baby cot inside (we specified this in our booking) it took another hour before some sweat smelly guy marched into our room with hammers and screwdrivers and started to buld our baby cot.. hard to belive isn't it? This was not the only one: toilet seat was broken, there we no doors to the toilet etc. Avoid at all cost!!",1,2012,07,01
28,"Beautiful views, poor service","I booked one night stay in this hotel thru American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program requesting early check in.
My room was not ready when I arrived.
When I finally got to my room it was dirty, closet doors looked like it has moisture damage, an awning was missing from the terrace and room walls & furniture had scratches all over. In addition, the room was set up for wheelchair access.
I have requested another room which took another few hours.
When I finally got another room it took about 40 min to bring up my luggage.
At that point I was up for 24 hours.
Room decorum is very simple & light fixtures look more like props from a theatre set - not appropriate for a 5 star hotel.
There is no lock or chain on the door. Maids & waiters knock on the door & go in without even pausing for a second. The ""Do not disturb"" sign does not stop anyone.
I had to block the door with a chair for the night.
The terrace & the view are magnificent.
This hotel is located on the mount Tibidabo & it is far away from everything which makes it inconvenient for sightseeing, but perfect if you need some peace & quiet.
The food was good.
I will not stay in this hotel again.",3,2012,06,27
28,Absolutely amazing !!!!!!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 days city break in April. We wanted quiet location and this was a perfect choice. Hotel is around 500m above Barcelona, surrounded  by the nature, magnificent views and a harmony -  very relaxing. We had very spacious, sunny room with enormous shower and a little patio outside. Hotel wasn't busy at all, maybe because we stayed during the week. Therefore everyday after visiting city I was relaxing in the Spa and pool area and usually I was there alone!!! Spa was open late - till 10pm. From the outside pool you can see whole Barcelona, the same as from the outside bar. The easiest way to get to the city is to walk along the path on the right side of the hotel, which takes you to a small village, where ticket for -funicular- can be purchased (2 Euro), which goes straight to city centre playa de Catalunia. I woudn't recommend to pay for the bus to the village, because the viewes from the path are amazing- we could even see camera flashes on Camp Nou football stadium from there!!  The taxi to the city centre cost around 30 euro, but drivers have problem with finding La Florida, therefore is always better to ask if they know where is it first. Hotel is advertising on their website free shuttle, however when I asked for it, I have been told that this is not available anymore. That was our first trip to Barcelona, surely not the last and surely the next  will be in Gran La Florida again.",5,2012,05,28
28,"Five Star View, Five Star Hotel","We stupidly decided to drive to this hotel after an international flight and use the rental car’s GPS.  We had a horrible time finding it with the GPS. Some very kind locals helped steer us in the right direction.  However, once we finally arrived at the hotel we were delighted.  We were warmly greeted by the reception with Cava and quickly checked into our room.  Our room was one of the rooms with the private terrace.  The view was outstanding looking out over Barcelona toward the sea.  The room was large with a clean, modern design feel.  Bed comfortable and room quiet.  The bathroom was enormous with “his and hers” toilet rooms, large multi-headed shower and deep tub.  Although it was a bit cool, we managed to have our breakfast on the terrace of our room.  The amusement part was closed when we were there so I cannot comment on the noise from the park. Room service was fast and the breakfast was excellent. The indoor pool was very nice.  I can see how the outdoor common terraces are a draw during the summer for drinks and brunch.  Because we were so tired from travel, we chose to eat at the hotel restaurant.  It was a great meal but not a place I would go out of my way for. In terms of location, the hotel is not very convenient if you want to visit the city.  Our plan was to stay here before heading up to Costa Brava the next day. So the location did not bother us. All in all, this was a fabulous hotel, a great start to our vacation and next time I’m in the area I would definitely find an excuse to treat myself to at least one night at this hotel.",5,2012,05,23
28,View with Calm,"We stayed here for a special birthday weekend, and knowing Barcelona well, this is a wonderful escape from the bussle below. The staff could not have been more helpful, and our corner room, with views over Barcelona and to the Coll Serolla behind was truly magnificent. 
I am a great fan of Barcelona, and there are certainly different hotels for different occasions there. Some might complain about the distance from the city, but this hotel is unashamably what it is! The view is to die for, and the general ambiance beit excellent breakfasts and a great indoor / outdoor pool make this a special experience.
After many years of wondering what the Florida would be like, we're really glad we found out!",5,2012,05,20
28,Fantastic hotel overlooking Barcelona,Third or fourth stay here on car launches. It's on a mountain inland of Barcelona with an old amusement park alongside. Absolutely stunning views of the whole of Barcelona to the sea. Good food. Fully five star. Fully justifies its status as a 'Gran Hotel'.,5,2012,05,17
28,A Gran'd' Hotel indeed,"Elegantly stylish, traditional and with only about 75 rooms, a little individual the Gran Hotel is one of the best places to stay in Barcelona.  I say 'in Barcelona' but in fact the hotel is just outside on top of Tibidabo with the most amazing views over the city. And this is the only drawback as to get into Barca you need to either use public transport - which is quite ok - or take a taxi - about 30 Euros.  Staff are polite, friendly and efficient. Food is tasty and reasonable...and I have been told that the pool and spa are great.",5,2012,05,16
28,Amazing!,"The only negative thing I can say about this place is that it is far away from the city. But then again, why would you stay here if you wanted busy nightlife right outside your doorstep? The rooms are beautiful, the pool area is great and the view is amazing. I stayed for just one night as it is by no means cheap, but it's a luxury well worh spending your money on.",5,2012,05,03
28,Too far away from the beautiful Barcelona,"Magnificent hotel but nothing near it except an amusement park.  Spa a bit cold and we used it once for that reason.  Bus only operates when amusement park open (in april just at weekends) otherwise you have a 25 euro taxi fare each way into Barcelona.  We ate in bar on one evening and were disappointed with lack of atmosphere there.  We were the only people there on a Saturday night.  60 euro for tapas and wine for 2 people.  Breakfast was lovely, room and view from balcony was gorgeous but looking out at Barcelona, we kind of wished that we'd stayed in the hustle and bustle of the city.  Really depends what you're looking for but for me, when I go to beautiful Barelona, I will stay central (eg lovely hotel regina near placa catalyuna)",3,2012,05,03
28,Did not  live up to expectations,"Just got back from a 3 night trip to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary. I will start with the positives: first impressions were very good, with the Hotel in a beautiful location with amazing views of the city and the mountains. We were greeted with a welcome drink and shown around the hotel by a member of the front desk. The room was spacious and the bathroom excellent in appearance). I had pre-booked a table at L'Orangerie, the hotel's restaurant. The food was of a very high quality and the wine list extensive. The Armagnac to finish off the meal was one of the largest I had ever been served. The cost including wine came to 160 Euros which seemed about right given the quality. 

From here things started to go down hill (no pun intended). I had written to the manager beforehand telling him our stay was a special celebration and if there was anything they could do to make the stay special it would be appreciated (possibly  flowers in the room, fresh fruit or champagne - nothing and I would have gladly paid. We retired to the room, only to find the Television didn't work, the telephone didn't work, the closure mechanism on the plug in the sink basin was broken and the bathroom scales did not work. The next day this was reported to the front desk staff. We spent the whole day in Barcelona, got back at 9pm and the TV had still not been fixed. We mentioned it again, A maintenance man appeared within 5 mins, managed to get it working but the picture quality was awful. I got fed up complaining so I left it.

After 2 days touring the city on foot and on bus tours, we decided on our final day to use the excellent spa facilities. Breakfast at 28 euros pp was a let down and did not match up in quality to L'Orangerie restaurant. We opted for the continental breakfast out on the terrace at 16 euros. Fresh fruit was plentiful and delicious but the pastries were very disappointing. We spent 2 hours in the Spa and on the Terrace and not once did a member fo staff come out to see if we wanted a drink. Wandering back to the indoor Lounge bar in bath robes or a swimming costume  to get a drink was unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. I did not expect Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental standards of customer service but I expected better than this. 

The best feature of the hotel is the Spa and the outdoor terrace, so it was disappointing to find that when the sun came out and all we wanted to do was sit out and enjoy the truly magnificent views, all the seat cushions had been left out to get soaked in the overnight rain!. 

There are no outdoor heaters and so I would recommend that anyone wanting to stay at the hotel and enjoy warm evenings on the terrace it would be best to go in Summer.

Plenty of other guests have commented about the 20 min bus trip, so I will not bother. The second night we had an evening meal in the city; as the last bus leaves at 8pm we got a taxi. A word of advice, make sure the Taxi driver knows where the hotel is. Ours didn't, the driver got totally lost,, the journey took an hour instead of 20 mins

I totally loved Barcelona and have put reviews of restaurants we went to on a different review. Our stay at La Florida should have been special, a truly memorable 5 star experience, instead it was no better the 3 star",3,2012,05,01
28,A wonderful relaxing 2 night experiance,"Amazing views both city view and mountain views. Although the hotel isn't in the city it only takes around 20mins in a car to travel to the city but a little longer via public transport. I don't believe the free shuttle bus is available anymore.
The front of house staff were very helpful, pleasant and polite, unfortunately catering staff were a little slow at times and had some difficulty communicating. We ordered room service on the first night which was delivered luke warm, when we complained the food was promptly collected and returned however as the same meal appeared to be reheated both the chicken and steak were quite tough to eat- un-enjoyable. Breakfast was delicious with a good selection.
The spa are, indoor pool, suana etc were fabulous.
The rooms were spacious, clean and well presented however there was an offensive smell that came from the bathroom which had been masked with air-freshener on our initial arrival.
Overall a lovely stay, only downside was the food, although we are quite particular about what we eat. Expensive for our means and but would definitely stay again if finances permit",4,2012,04,24
28,A wonderful hotel overlooking the city,"Just back form a great long weekend in Barcelona.  This was our 2nd visit to the city and opted for a slightly out of town hotel - one with amazing views of the city.  We were a little nervous about traveling between hotel and the city, but this was not a problem.  Although the hotel no longer runs a free shuttle, there is a cheap (2.60euros each way) bus that runs from right outside the hotel.  This departs at 20 minute intervals and the journey takes about 20 minutes to plaza catalunya.  

Could not fault our stay - although one little grumble was the lack of tea and coffee in room.",5,2012,04,10
28,Great hotel,Great views. Very romantic. Great service. Some say it is a bi far from downtown Barcelona but I disagree. Free shuttle takes you downtown and back.,5,2012,03,22
28,Perfect for a one night escapade,"If you are planing to visit Barcelona this hotel is not very convenient as it sits on top of a mountain behind the city and the only way to get up there is by climbing up (with your car, that is) a very winding road that make the city seem even further away.

But if what you want si a a city getaway then this hotel is perfect for you. You won't be disturbed up on the peak and once there you can view the whole city without having to deal with its noises and traffic.

Service is excellent and the spa is nice, especially the outdoor infinity pool.
Of course it is expensive, but it's a five star luxury, right?

Rooms are very big and their terraces very pleasant.

Breakfast is unbelievable, t would be worth going up there just for it.",5,2012,03,16
28,Did not meet my expectations,"I will not mention or complain about the hotel being located outside the city. I was perfectly aware of this and I know Barcelona pretty well.

A lot of people enjoy the location and the view. I had an early walk in the morning to go to visit the Sagrat Cor church and it was perfect.

Now the hotel itself. I checked in around 4pm and the receptionist gave me a tour of the hotel.

My room (410) had a city view (4th floor and a small balcony).  Room was OK but will not consider it as Deluxe. One tip: the beautiful deluxe rooms surrounded with big windows featured on the hotel website are located on the second floor.

I'm a Leading Hotel Member and get a welcome gift and a one-category room upgrade (subject to availability) amongst other privileges.

I found on the desk a card on a mineral bottle. I opened it and it was a welcome card from the General Manager wishing me a pleasant stay and ""I have the pleasure to present you this bottle of extra virgin oil from our region as an exclusive gift""... At the beginning I thought it was a joke as there was no olive oil but a bottle of water.

Therefore when they deliver my luggage I made the remark and the girl indicated to me that they would bring the bottle of olive oil…

I found that this way of doing this was something strange for a Leading especially when they have my flight details and time of arrival so.

Anyway, I took a shower (shower head was had white limestone trace… and I have to carry out the soap and the shower gel from the sink to the shower… normally in other hotels of such category they put soap and shower gel in the shower or on the bathtub) 

Anyway, I only stayed in my room about 1 hour as I was meeting some friends downtown.

When I came back at 3am in the morning:

No turndown service
My wet towels were still there (the towels in the bathroom have not been changed)
I had used a glass to take some medicine and it was still on the desk

However the olive oil gift has been delivered. My question is: how come the person who came did not notice there was a dirty glass.

However, the unbelievable surprise was the mini bar. Attached is a picture!!! Frankly speaking I don't know where they pick up this mini bar but this is just unacceptable for a co-called luxury hotel.

Wi-Fi never worked though I mentioned this to the reception as soon as I arrived but nobody really cared. They asked me if I had duly selected the network... I mentioned it again when checking out and I was told, ""It seems that we have a problem our technician is checking"".

Breakfast was more than ordinary: the ham and the chorizo were so dried. I really don't know when they have been cut. Bacon was over cooked and the scrambled eggs did not look at all like this.

I always enjoy breakfast in Spain as they have a specialty ""Chocolate a la taza"" which is a thick and delicious chocolate. I ordered one and got a kind of ordinary Ovomaltine chocolate.

In conclusion the service in this hotel is not up to a Leading Hotel.

The only positive thing was the price: 120 Euros a night. But considering that you'll need to take a cab (20 Euros one way) you may reconsider your choice if you really want a top-notch experience.",2,2012,03,14
28,"2nd time around, and still love it!","I've just come back from my 2nd visit to La Florida, and can't wait to go back again.  If it's your first time to Barcelona, you need to be aware that it's a 20 minute taxi ride to get into central Barcelona, however, as this was my 3rd visit to Barcelona I preferred to stay in this amazing hotel again as opposed to a hotel in the centre of Barcelona.

From the Cava in reception when we arrived, followed by a guided tour of the hotel, the service in this hotel is impeccable.  The staff even run to open the door for you when you enter and leave the hotel. 

The main pulling point of this hotel is the location, being on top of a hill at Tibadabo, with stunning views overlooking Barcelona.  It's a beautiful old building, built in the 20's that has been tastefully restored into a modern boutique hotel.  The sauna/spa area with the indoor/outdoor pool is full of contemporary stainless steel, with an infinity pool overlooking Barcelona.  Both the indoor and outdoor pool are open all year round, however the inside/outside glass panel is shut during the winter to keep the indoor part of the pool warm.

This is the 2nd time I was fortunate to be allocated a room with a double balcony, one overlooking the mountains where I could see the snow capped Pyrenees, and another with a view of Barcelona and partial sea view.  The beds here are huge, with the bed linen, including duvet covers being fully changed on a daily basis.

As this is a superior 5* hotel, the price of food and drinks at the bar reflected this.  An orange juice was 6 Euro and a coffee was 5 Euro.  As I had not paid extra for breakfast to be included, it worked out a lot more cost effective to walk up the hill for less than 10 minutes to Tibadabo Park (the old theme park) where there is a cafe/restaurant directly opposite.  This served reasonably priced food and drinks.  It was also a pleasant walk before breakfast breathing in the clean air, high above the city, before sitting outside the cafe looking up at the church.  

All in all, I would highly recommend La Florida to anyone who wants to go to a low-key boutique hotel where they will be looked after.  You can stay here for a whole weekend and not change from your sumptuous towelling bathrobe if you so wished.  It was perfectly normal for guests to be sat outside on the terraces in dressing gowns and slippers eating breakfast.  Likewise, I spent my first evening lounging around the bar in my dressing gown after I had visited the spa.  I can't wait to go back!",5,2012,03,14
28,Excellent,"I´ve chosen this place to ask my girlfriend to marry me.
The staff was very helpful arrange everything. I booked a room overlooking the city and the view was breathtaking!
We had candle light dinner and presented the ring with the dessert...she said yes!

We will be back every year to celebrate our anniversary!

Thank you",5,2012,02,29
28,It's not only the view!,"Our first impressions were very good, as we pulled up in our hire car and were greeted by a very friendly guy offering us a welcome drink, to take all our luggage to the room and to park the car. Reception were equally friendly, and we were given a quick tour of the hotel before being taken to our room. The room (106) was large with a private terrace overlooking the pool and the fantastic views to Barcelona. The bathroom was large as well, with a huge shower and separate bath. The room had a fridge, but no coffee making facility. Turndown replaced towels but left no water or chocolates!
We ate in the bar, which was good - but be aware that the tapas portions are huge, and one would have sufficed for me. Breakfast was a very comprehensive buffet, and very good.
The only problem we experienced was a smell in the bathroom: we disguised it with Chanel, and it was gone in the morning!
The hotel is a long way out of the centre of Barcelona, which wasn't a problem for us, as we had a car and were only staying one night, but it might be if you want to go into town for an evening.",5,2012,02,28
28,Too far away and not understanding of the customer but very pretty,"We came to see our son who is studying in Barcelona. When we made the reservation it sounded like (from their promotion) that it would be relatively easy to travel to City Center from the hotel. Not true.

When we found this out we asked if we could please not check-in because it would be a problem seeing our son. We were told that they would abide by the hotel rules for cancellations and charge us for both days. I asked if we could split the difference and at least let us go for one day. That did not work either. Very unusual way of treating a customer. 

We decided to have lunch there at their lovely restaurant with truly spectacular views of Barcelona. As it turns out they have a large number of cats roaming around the tables, when I put my hands in my lap one of the cats leaped up and bit me - almost piercing the skin. 

When I told someone at the main desk about being bit they said yes it's a problem and they are trying to manage it. I can't believe that they would tolerate a customer being bit by what could be diseased cats. 

We left immediately before we had staid a single night!",3,2012,02,18
28,"A piece of heaven on earth, fantasic facilities, pure luxury, great setting, helpful staff & excellent food.","We booked this break for my husbands 40 th on 14.2.12 after reading the reviews on trip advisor as we wanted some relaxing us time. We paid 89 euros per night (& booked directly with hotel) and booked a mountain view room 503. The luxury room and facilities totally exceeded our expectations. The swimming pool and jaccuzzi were divine after a day exploring the city. On arrival we were given a glass of fizzy and a tour of the hotel. Our room was large and the bed was comfy and huge. From our window we could see a old style fun fair which was not in operation, I believe it only runs in the main season.
It is important to say that the hotel over looks Barcelona and is not central to all of the sights. However you can get the train from catalunya square to the end of the line and then the 111 Tibi bus, which stops virtually outside the hotel. Just ask at the tourist info at catalunya square. We chose a taxi for 15-20 euro as it is a lot quicker and as long as you figure this into the price of your holiday it's so much easier. The staff at hotel are very knowledgeable re transport and getting around the city. A guest at the hotel recommended a restaurant for authentic paella: 7 portes or 7 doors in English ; this was outstanding and not usual yellow rice and prawns, gorgeous. It was 22 euros each so not cheap but worth it. This restaurant is located at the port past the Marina. Just ask it's been around for many years. The old town and the port were my favourite places and a stroll from catalunya ( main square) down la rambles takes you past the old city where the cathedral is and directly to the port.. About a mile.  The underground is clean and easy, just purchase 2 euro ticket from the machine to travel anywhere in the city.
We loved our stay but the hotel made it for us even though it's in tibidabo outside the city. The peace is amazing. The food outstanding and the best sangria I had during my stay. We will be returning. ",5,2012,02,17
28,Misleading !!!!,"For a 5 star hotel, this is the worst experience ever.  We bought a romantic package for 405€ which was a one night package with welcome drink, dinner, breakfast buffet, cava and bath in room and 25% discount of spa treatments.  When we arrived they did not give us the welcome drink , we had to wait for our room to be ready but after and hour and a half of waiting we had to go and ask for our room.  The room was okay but we were ready to go for spa and relax during the day. When we were in our ropes in the spa looking for the service we were suppose to get we were told that there was nothing available. Not even the day after.  Still the reception lady told us that the spa is open for us until 20:00.  
When came to dinner we were told what we were gonna have for dinner. On the internet there was never mentioned that there was a set dinner. 

Anyway, over priced and really not worth 405€ !!!! 

",2,2012,02,04
28,As good as it gets.,"Our stay at La Florida Hotel Tibidabo was from start to finish blissful, a great location then it hits you between the eyes with the elegance and charm of the place, our room wasn’t the best or worst room in the hotel but it was fantastically comfortable, we had a stunning view of Barcelona from it.
We ate in the Restaurant on only one evening but the service was fantastic and the setting again made me feel like I was James Bond, the pool and the bar at the pool was so cool you could imagine Lionel Messi wondering past, the hotel was so special that there was a loan car for guests to borrow for a morning or afternoon",5,2012,01,25
28,Oldie but Goldie!,"I have been a very frequent visitor to Barcelona over the last ten years. As those of you who have traveled there more than once will also know there is a new design hotel operning pretty much every other month.

Because of that I neglected the Florida for many years mainly because of maybe its only big disadvantage being the quite far distance from downtown.

Apart from that the Florida offers great 5 star service and a unbeaten scenic view of the city and its surrounding. The restaurant, lobby and rooms are very tastefully decorated yet not overdone. The spa is well above average with a great indoor/outdoor lap pool and many spa treatment options. The breakfast selection is extraordinary for Spanish standards!

If you are not coming for business and don´t have to go into town twice a day the Florida is a perfect hideaway for a quiet weekend especially during the winter months as they offer great weekend packages.",5,2012,01,13
28,Panoramic city views at bargain 5 star Barcelona hotel,"Large rooms with balconies, huge bathrooms, complimentary wifi, and use of heated inddoor pool/spa topped by commanding city/mountain views at bargain prices make this irresistible 
The 20 min/2euro ride to the city center are more than adequately compensated by all the positive attributes and the bargain price compared to many of the downtown hotels",5,2012,01,05
28,An excellent experience meeting most of my expectations,"We stayed in this Hotel for 3 days and two nights. We had a warm welcome, and were allotted a room right away on arrival. The hotel location is on a hill top, giving a marvelous view of the city on one side and the mountains on the other. We got the mountain view, unfortunately all the city views were booked. But never mind, there is a church closeby which is one of the tourist attractions. Here one can see a breathtaking view of the city. We had a car, so the transport did not bother us. It takes around 20 min to get to the city by car. The rooms were good, although our beds leg was broken and was replaced by a stone... This was the only bad thing I found, other than this  the hotel staff were very friendly, and service was quite good.",5,2012,01,05
28,Romantic and relaxing haven in Barcelona!,"We booked this hotel on 'LHW' at an excellent rate for three nights and I am so glad we did! After spending the whole day walking around the busy streets of Barcelona it's so lovely to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the sparkling city by night. 
The food at this hotel is really amazing! My husband and I were very satisfied after every meal. 
Through LHW we were upgraded to a room with a very large balcony overlooking Barcelona. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was huge with 2 shower heads, and another bonus is the l'occitane amenities! Hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. 
We took a taxi up and down the mountain which was very easy, but if you are on a budget there is a local bus.
Can't wait to go back to Barcelona :)",5,2011,12,18
28,"Amazing views of Barcelona, beautiful hotel, amazing for the price!","Booked through LHW and got an unbelievable rate of 67 euros a night for off peak time. Got an upgrade as well which was a bonus, had a balcony looking out over Barcelona from the top of Tibidabo. It is near the cathedral and Tibidabo theme park, but it was very quiet at this time of the year so it was very relaxing. Welcomed with champagne and shown around, very good food and a great hotel all in all. Staff were also excellent and very helpful. It does cost about 20 euros each way into the city by cab, but it is worth it to be outside the city and in a quieter area. Very comfortable bed!",5,2011,12,13
28,"View, architecture, swimming pool","The view of Barcelona is great from here. Swimming pool is really faboulous as well as all the Spa area with Saunas, steam bath and more. Try the Aqua Spa and a feet massage.
We have been upgraded to a city view room (thanks!) and the personnels really tried all their best to make our staying confortable. bar is a bit slow. Very bad WiFi connection, if available ; not working in the room.
A bit far from the city centre, it took us about 20 min. By car to go.
Breakfast is too expensive.",4,2011,12,11
28,the view amazing,"i stay here with boyfriend for part holiday in europe. this amazing hotel up on top of mountain. The decoration very nice and staff some very nice but some not so nice. Some staff not want to help. Mostly everything perfect, the food very good and we relax so much when we here.",4,2011,12,01
28,Great views and customer service,"A very pleasant stay, really. Getting out is easy as long as you know that it is by bus/funicular/train (all three) to get to Plaza Catalunya (about 30 min.). So I suggest to buy the T-10 or transport card for 10 trips when visiting for more than 3 days since it is good for all these 3 means. Taxi may be the only option to go back to the hotel late at night (about 15 to 20 euros depending on where you take it). Great spa and food too. But the best of all, besides the gorgeous views of the city and The Sierras, is the Customer Service. Don't feel guilty if you miss out the city for a day... ;-)",5,2011,11,29
28,What a fantastic hotel!,"We arrived via public transport and were pleasantly surprised by how straight forward it was to get the metro, finicular and bus. (we had researched prior to arrived) We arrived at nine pm after a long day's site seeing and flying out of Gatwick at 2am, so a little dreary.  We were totally surprised to discover that we had been upgraded to their 530Euro suite.  It had amazing views from the double aspect room, a delightful balcony with a jacuzzi.  The bath was big enough for the both of us (side by side) and we vowed that night never to leave it.

We spent a total of 4 days in Barcelona and enjoyed our time at the hotel, the breakfast was special with a selective array of food, you were paying for quality of choice not quantity of choice.  The view out of the restaurant window was wonderful.  To view the city while drinking your freshly sqeezed spanish orange juice was fabulous.

The pool and spa area were very enticing and the only downside was the temperature of the outside pool at that time of year - a little chilly but we had fun in our nice and hot jacuzzi upstairs. 

I would recommend everyone choose this hotel for their city break in Barcelona, yes it is out of the city but it is wonderful to spend your evenings and early mornings gazing at it from your balcony, planning your days sightseeing.

We were there at the beginning of October 2011 and it was a good time to go.  Not too busy in the hotel or the city, but still warm enough to sunbathe.

Full marks Hotel de la Florida.  We love you ad we will be back.

Natalie & Phil",5,2011,10,23
28,"Lovely hotel as long as you're aware of the ""downsides""","I stayed here for a few days with a friend as a ""get away from everything"" break.  The hotel itself is beautiful and the spa is amazing.  

There are a few things that some would see as down sides but if you're aware of them then I think that they don't really make much difference.  

The hotel is a short way out of Barcelona itself and the only way to get there and in to Barcelona by public transport is either by taxi or by bus, funicular and train.  However, the upside of this is that the location is pretty quiet (we went when the amusement park was mostly closed so there wasn't noise from there).  There is apparently a shuttle bus from the hotel in to Barcelona but this only  runs in the summertime.

The other downside is the food.  We had buffet breakfast with our package and it was amazing - fruit, cereals, meats and cheese, croissants.  

there is a restaurant at the hotel for food in the evening and also a bar that serves food.  The prices are quite high and unfortunately I can't say if the food was worth it as I am vegetarian - the one vegetarian option on either menu was patatas bravas at the bar.  Because of the location, there's no where else to go for food (apart from a cafe by the amusement park) so we brought food in Barcelona itself all the time.  

However, despite these, I had a fantastic time at the hotel, using the pool and spa facilities and sunbathing in October!  The staff were also amazingly friendly and helpful.

The room that we had had a mountain view which was beautiful, especially when sat on the private balcony.  The room itself was massive and was really nicely decorated - the bathroom was amazing.  

I would definitely recommend the place as long as you're prepared for a bit of travelling.",4,2011,10,11
28,a good hotel for relaxation & views,"We stayed at the Hotel La Florida in August and we realised quickly that this hotel is for relaxing, taking it easy and enjoying food, with great views. 
The pool area is fantastic, we had a fish pedicure and a massage. 
I thought the service of the bar/lunch at the pool was very slow, and the breakfast was good, but could be better for a 5 star hotel. 
The hotel is really a place to go to if you want peace, pampering and wonderful views of Barcelona. 
The staff were very friendly and our room (terrace view) was incredibly big with an amazing shower and lovely terrace in the sun.",5,2011,09,20
28,fantastic and best for totall relaxation,forget all the rankings...this hotel is best...vieuw is one and only..personal is very personal/friendly/familywise...hotel is luxurious but familiar/homely at same time.....t2 bus stops for hotel..takes you in 20 min to centre =euro 2.80..so dont have to take cab..in summer months...also possibility use privatcab of hotel...so why its not top of rankings..for me is biggest riddle..i also know other 5 star in barcelona..but no...this one is by far best.,5,2011,09,01
28,A Beutifal location,"A beautiful property. Only there one night. Met a friend who had booked a 3 nite stay. The view of the city and the amusement park is breathtaking. The pool and spa area is fantastic.
the bathroom was luxurious.
I would like to go back and stay for a few nights.",5,2011,08,30
28,Nice Place,"We had a corner suite with views of San Cugat. The hotel is nicely situated on top of a hill, next to the amusement park. There are free shuttles going forward and back from the city, but at night we have to come back on a taxi, which is around 20 Euros from Plaça Espana. The pool is very nice, and the restaurant offers a good meal. Overall we had a nice stay, and would recommend the hotel.",5,2011,08,23
28,Fantastic hotel just outside Barcelona,"I spent four nights at the  Gran Hotel La Florida and had a great time. The hotel overlooks Barcelona and sits in a wonderful setting. The hotel itself is very well laid out. Rooms are comfortable, well designed and pleasant to use. Pool and terraced sun decks are lovely. Fantastic food (both formal and informal). Service is a little laid back but this is Spain so what do you expect (that's a compliment, not a criticism).",5,2011,08,20

28,"Spectacular, Romantic, Breath-taking Views, Not Central","This is not a hotel for someone who is going to Barcelona for the first time  and wants to constantly go in and out of their hotel to walk to the various sites.  This plase is for relaxation and luxury.

We stayed at the Florida at the end of our 1st trip to Barcelona, but after we already had stayed in the center of town, done some side trips etc.  By then, we wanted to just stay somewhere stunning and relax.  Florida was perect for this.

You have to take a 20 minute taxi ride. Once there, you are on top of the world.  Phenomenal views.  This term gets over-used, but really- the views of Barcelona are spectacular.

The infinity pool starts indoors, and continues outdoors to the edge of a cliff. overlooking Barcelona.  Perfection.

Expensive, but worth it.  We stayed for 2 nights and it was a worthwhile splurge. We did not encounter any of the negatives that people are mentioning.",5,2011,08,05
28,Breathtaking view of Barcelona,"This was the perfect hotel for us for 4 nights in July 2011. We wanted to stay someplace peaceful just outside the city, and this hotel was the best views of Barcelona you can imagine. It's at the top of a winding road high above the city, so if you want to be able to walk out your hotel door to bars & clubs, then this place is not for you. The stainless steel pool & jacuzzi are wonderful, as is the entire bar area. You owe it to yourself to order an Aperol Spritz or a glass of wine and enjoy it from one of the many terraced levels by the bar.",5,2011,07,26
28,Loved the views - it was a beautiful place!,"Stayed at Gran Hotel La Florida after our cruise in July 2011.  Despite the distance from the city, we would definitely stay there again!  It was about 40 euro taxi ride from the cruise port up the winding hill and mountainside of Tibidao.  

The hotel views were gorgeous!  We could see the entire city (even our cruise ship) from our room window.  We rode the free shuttle down to the city center (best to reserve the day before) then rented scooter for two days ~60 euros.

Food is very very expensive at the hotel and not really for my palate (and I eat everything).  I find the prices scale down as you go down the mountain.  Also, its a bit windy and cold compared to the city area - so bring wrap or cover!  (sometimes a good 10 degree F difference).

I would come back to Gran Hotel La Florida in a heartbeat, but budget for transportation!",5,2011,07,25
28,Fantastic room and views but something not quite right about the service,Fantastic room with fabulous panorama of Barcelona and the comfiest bed ever. Some absolutely delightful staff individually - but (on a less positive note) when we arrived late on the Friday there was nothing to eat except for very basic nibbles (despite having advised the hotel beforehand that we would be late arrivals) and then on the Saturday night we were refused (rather bluntly) dinner (the small restaurant was full and most likely the fabulous panorama attracts customers from far and wide  - although as newly arrived visitors how were we to know this?) so had to make do with an OK bar meal on terrace (delightful waiter making up for his colleague's earlier brusqueness).  For the price (5 star) strongly consider we should have been advised when we arrived to  reserve table by the hotel management as we took it for granted guests had first preference. Two weddings on the Friday and the Saturday perhaps also diverted management's attention from the regular guests; and it is always risky when a hotel is running two businesses at the same time!,3,2011,07,18
28,Pick another Hotel,"The hotel has a beautiful  view, but that is all.

Staff is extremely slow on service and the facilities that are list are typically unavailable.  If the hotel has booked  ( which they have every nite I have been here)  the pool, bar and terrace are off limits!!!!   This is the only reason to be at this hotel.   Combine this with the long distance from the city and you have the wrong hotel.",1,2011,07,15
28,Best View in Barcelona!,"(My family and I stayed here for 3 days before our cruise) We landed in Barcelona on June 8th and were there for 2 nights and 3 days. When we arrived that night, there was a Fashion Show going on. Caught off guard with all the people and excitement buzzing around the front of the hotel, we were told that we can attend the event and eat/drink for free! Our trip started off with a bang. The taxi took about 60 Euro for 4 of us with 7 bags to get to La Florida. - They added additional charges for more bags.  
Lets start off with the ""likes"" : The Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is much smaller than the big chain hotels so they can offer more of their time to the guests. As you arrive they greet each visitor with Cava - very similar to Champagne . The view is great! It really allows you to have a sense of direction of the city before and after you go sightseeing. The rooms were spacious with very nice and big bathrooms. The breakfast is buffet style but they offer quick breakfast near the pool, which is cheaper. we used the quick breakfast every morning and found it very good. It was foggy most mornings when we were there, but still had a good view of the city for the majority of the day. The facility is just as nice as the pictures. The pools are amazing, they also offer a hot tub and the pool bathrooms include steam room and sauna! 
Now for the ""dislikes""
We had 2 rooms. one with a mountain view - the cheapest room and one with a ocean view. our ocean view had basically the same view as the mountain view. the next day we complained because we were paying more and it wasn't worth it. So they finally moved us to the real ocean view room and it was remarkable. WAY NICER! they were hesitant to switch us to the better room, which is the only reason we didn't love this hotel. So i recommend if buying an ocean view room to ask for the rooms completely facing the ocean. not on the side of the building. or stay on the mountain view towards the front of the hotel.  Also, our tv wouldnt allow either of the rooms to order movies because we were already ""checked out"" on the first night. They fixed this the next morning.
All in all, we really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again. I would recommend it to anyone for the view. We took the shuttle into town every day, and took a taxi (19-25 euro) back to the hotel at night. If you want to be close to the city, this is not the place for you. If you want to relax away from the noise and have a romantic stay, this is the place for you at an affordable price. Or if you don't mind staying in town for long periods of time to prevent going up and down the mountain.You cant beat it. I will add a picture of the first ""semi ocean view"" and the ""real ocean view"" sorry i took these really early before the fog was gone. Enjoy the hotel!",5,2011,07,11
28,We loved the hotel hope to come back,"Stayed at the hotel for three nights and found it to be a quite oasis within easy distance of the city centre. Amazing views, great service friendly staff overall. It has all the amenities of a large hotel but personilsed feel of a boutique hotel. Staff was helpful friendly and informed. Used the amazing pool with my daughters loved it with a infinity style pool overlooking the city. Hope to be back soon.",5,2011,07,08
28,A real shame.........,"It was OK - just....... It wasn't exactly bad, frustratingly though, you sense it could be great.
But life is too short and right now there are far better places to be in Barcelona.

The good:-
-Beautiful and Grand original building, that has had a cleverly designed renovation which maximises it's limited outdoor space to brilliant effect.
-Fabulous panoramic views over the city below.
-it's uniqueness.
-The staff are helpful.
-lovely sunbathing / pool  terrace area with bar and  lunch menu service.

The bad:-
-Strange, chaotic check in area. (if its busy, be prepared for a long wait to be seen)
-Hotel is showing many signs of wear and tear in most areas - giving a very unpolished ""dog eared"" appearance overall.
-Fixtures and fittings are generally of a low quality or poorly maintained. 
-The Spa staff were excellent,  however we found the Spa facilities to be woefully inadequate with most of them unusable i.e. broken showers, sauna, no toiletries or amenities AT ALL, not even tissues or soap. Nor does the Hotel provide bathrobes or slippers for the Spa (you are expected to go from the changing room to the treatment rooms - on another floor, via  public areas and a lift wearing only a towel)
-And girls beware if using the Spa  - I couldn't believe it but, they have a male cleaner for the womens changing rooms and  -  Oh yes you guessed it!  he walked in while I was naked.
-The Hotel is on a road congested with continual slow moving  tourist coaches and  buses to the nearby Tibidabo fairground, hence a lot of noise and fumes during fairground opening hours.
-If you value peace and quiet, take your MP3 or some earplugs because as well as the traffic noise, you can see the fairground from the Hotel (and hear the screams of those on the rides)
-Hotel is a long distance from the ciy centre and there is nothing much nearby.

My experiences at this Hotel left me feling sad and disappointed, particularly for the staff. I accept that some of the negative points I've mentioned may be beyond  control, but this Hotel should be allowed to regain some of it's former Glory and be so much better.
While there  - we saw  major renovation works to the forecourt being undertaken ............If only the owners could focus more on the details, to be objective and prepared to listen to feedback then make basic operational and cosmetic changes as well as structural ones.
If they do this, I may be tempted to visit Gran Hotel La Florida again.",3,2011,07,07
28,Excellent for Couples,"If you want a romantic place to stay in Barcelo this hotel is the one. Perched atop a mountain overlooking the City. It's a little bit of a pain to come and go to the city especially if you have kids like we did.
Overall excellent service and stately rooms.",5,2011,06,21
28,"perfect, just perfect","the staff are so friendly, always willing to oblige, a welcome glass of cava, making for a relaxed atmosphere, great food, fantastic terrace with fab pool and the view overlooking Barcelona, just stunning, from first thing in the morning till last thing at night, will be going back again.....................",5,2011,06,17
28,Nice and relaxing,"We stayed in the hotel for a week in june 2011.
Its a beautiful hotel, with the most amazing view of Barcelona that you can get.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Nice bright and spacious room and a lovely bathroom with l´óccitane products. 
We came with a baby, who got his own wooden bed, with lovely embrodiert cover; a 5 star bed for a little prince :)
The hotel is located in a national park, Collserola, with possibilities of walking and biking. We walked around and enjoyed the view and there are villages up there with cozy resturants in the wood (fes  Resturant Ideal in the village Vallvidrera).
And next door to the hotel there is an old charming funfare.
We had a rent-car with can be recomended due to the location, but the free hotel shuttle is great, just book it a day in advance. Parking in the hotel is 21 euros a day.

But since its a 5 star hotel we had high expectations, so i want to comment on a few things that were a bit dissapointing.
- the womens showers in the spa was really dirty, layer of dirty plaque all over the floor tiles.
-the caldarium smelled of fungus
-the swimmingpool was too cold, 24 degrees. (we acyually checked with a thermometer, to see if we could take the baby in)
-the duvet in the room did not have a proper cover, but rather sheets that were folded over it, so in the morning i found myselfe sleeping on a uncovered duvet. 
-the staff was really friendly and helpful, but a bit slow, and it seemed that there were lack of people taking charge. 
-the breakfast was nice, and one could enjoy it on the fantastic patio with a view of the city. Champagne breakfast available. But there were no vegetables at all, witch was a bit dissapointing for salad lovers.

In general we really enjoyed our stay, and i can recomend it. But we re not left with a feeling that we really want to come back to la Florida on our next Barcelona stay, it lacks the ""WOW"" factor that we were hoping for.",4,2011,06,12
28,Leaking ceiling!!,"My husband and I checked into this hotel for 3 nights last September. We were impressed by the check-in staff, who were very charming. That night however, the ceiling of the room that we were in started leaking incessantly. When we called the front desk, they said that maintenance would come in only after 7am, and in the meantime, to bear with it. It also appeared that they knew it came from the bathroom upstairs - so why put us in a room where they knew there would be problems? Didn't enjoy our stay what with interrupted sleep and all. 

Also, the taxi rides were costly, as we were told that no shuttle buses were running.",3,2011,06,12
28,Wonderful hotel,We stayed at this hotel - what a surprise - perched on top of the hill overlooking Barcelona.  Staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfasts were great and the best thing was the free shuttle to the city.  If you're looking for somewhere a bit special this is the place.  It was our 50th wedding anniversary and we were upgraded and given a bottle of champagne as a present.,5,2011,05,09
28,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for one week in February 2011. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff is very helpful. It is up and away from the city of Barcelona - but we found that to be a good thing after being in the city all day. You can take a taxi from downtown to the hotel(17-20 Euros) or take the metro/funicular/bus. Public transport is easy and inexpensive. What we did was take the metro/bus during the daylight hours and a taxi later in the evening. Worked out well for us.

I would stay at this hotel again. The restaurant was also very good and the pool/hottub excellent! Perfect ending to a wonderful day in Barcelona!

Enjoy!",5,2011,04,06
28,Absolutely beautiful hotel - lives up to the 5 star rating!,"I have pretty high standards and this hotel met every one! The hotel is marvelous... revamped old building, very charming, beautifully decorated, free wifi, staff was so nice an accommodating! The ONLY rub is that it is not centrally located. The hotel is on Tibidabo, which is the hill overlooking the city... that means amazing views, but you need to taxi (about 20 euros one way) or use public transportation (which includes a bus to the funicular, funicular to train, train to city - about 45 minutes). The free hotel shuttle was not operating when we were there, which was a small bummer. On the other hand, not being in the city central means peace and quite. This was not my first time to Barcelona, so I quite enjoyed being removed from the bustle of the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but if you want to be located in the middle of this city, it's not for you.",5,2011,03,01
28,best pool in Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel with the friendliest staff I have ever come across. No shuttle bus when we were there so some taxi rides but it was worth it. Food, rooms and service all exceptional.",5,2011,01,25
28,Missed the bus,"This hotel has it all...great location with panoramic views, good food, a first class spa and friendly service.  The only drawback to our visit was that (in January) there was no offer of a shuttle bus despite it being advertised on  La Florida's website, nor was the local direct service bus operating (operational from April), leaving us with hefty taxi fares...40 Euros (at least) for the round trip.  

The alternative to all this was to hop on a bus, then get the furnicular and then catch a train...",4,2011,01,24
28,Amazing building with urgent maintenance needs,"We stay at la Florida only one day, I know the hotel since 6 or 7 years ago, is an amazing restored building from 1925 or so, but the last 2 years, the maintenance is zero, things are falling apart, some taps are not working and need a deeply paint everywhere, fix the windows, etc, is a shame for a building like this and after the huge restoration nobody is taking care of this things.",3,2011,01,05
28,"Nice property, but it has its drawbacks.","The high points: the view is spectacular and the staff is nice (if inefficient).  Gran Florida is good hotel for those who want the best of both worlds -- access to the city, but a quiet, picturesque location to retire to at the end of the day.  Despite its location off the beaten path, we never had problems catching cabs or arranging alternative transportation except on NYE night, which was totally understandable.  That being said: despite the relatively recent renovation in 2003, the property is showing wear-and-tear (threadbare furniture, stains on the bedding, black scuffs all over the walls, leaking fountain in the pool area, etc.).  On our last night there, the sewage system backed up and the aroma was evident throughout the property, but most particularly in our in-suite bathroom.  The staff laughed it off, which was inappropriate given the severity of the smell. Also, the service in the restaurant is almost nonexistent, and the food is disappointingly flavorless and not properly cooked -- raw chicken, yuck.  While a hotel's restaurant doesn't usually factor in to my evaluation of the overall quality of the facilities, in this case because the hotel is so far away from downtown and there are really no other options on Tibidabo, I think it's worth mentioning how bad it was.",3,2011,01,04
28,"If you're willing to ""brave"" public transport and spend a few bucks on taxis...","If you're willing to ""brave public transport and spend a few bucks on taxis, Gran Hotel La Florida should be on your short list of potential Barcelona hotels.

GHLF is a true 5-star property. Service and setting are top-notch. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on and the bedding, towels, robes, etc. were of the highest quality. 

Explore the hotel's website; this will show you exactly what you'll be getting for your money. And point of fact, you really do get more than your money's worth here; perhaps because the hotel is not in Barcelona city proper the bang for the buck ratio is extremely high.

The irony is, it's the fact that the hotel is ""outside"" the city - above it in fact - which probably accounts for the great deals available.

(Just as a guide, pre-booking will get you a rate of 140-euro a night or even less; with my package deal through Sceptre Tours I paid far less than even that!)

Our fifth floor room lacked a balcony, but come with three rather than the usual two near floor to ceiling windows. It was quite a large room, especially when considering the marble bathroom had separate rooms for 1) the sink tube, 2) toilet/bidet, and 3) shower.

The shower itself offered an adjustable  double rainfall-head fixture and while we didn't use the tub, it also offered a shower hose option.

Aside from the phenomenal view of Tibidabo Amusement Park and the Temple de Sagrat Cor out our window, each room is equipped with a large wall mounted flat screen  TV offering a few channels in English.

Each room has a mini-bar fridge with room enough to add your own goodies should you decide to save a few bucks by stocking up on ""snacks.""

GHLF is a spa hotel, but beyond the various professional treatments, the hotel offers all their guests use of the large, heated indoor/outdoor pool and indoor hot tub as well as the locker rooms which off both ""wet"" and ""dry"" saunas and both waterfall and multi-jet massaging showers.

We flew home on the afternoon of December 11th, but prior to checking out of the hotel, I was swimming outside that morning! (The setting of the outdoor pool/sunbathing/dining area is simply stunning... overlooking both the entire city of Barcelona and beyond it the Mediterranean Sea.)

We had a wonderful lunch at the hotel one day - at the main restaurant (L'Orangerie) and while not light on the pocketbook, the experience is well worth the cost for the romantic ""foodie"" memory. (Again... the service as well as quality of the food was outstanding.)

We had snacks and cocktails on evening at the hotel lobby bar (Barca - the idolized local football team was staying at our hotel that night!) one evening and I've gotta say... again... bang for the buck we couldn't complain!)

Oh... and something I found especially neat - something that put a smile on my face each night - was that come nightfall, from anywhere in the city you can point to the ""star"" represented by the stunningly lit up Temple de Sagrat Cor at the top of Mount Tibidabo (the spot from which legend states Lucifer took Jesus to survey the world the devil would give him dominion over if only he would grant Satan his allegiance) and tell folks... ""yep... see that light up there... that's where my hotel is!""

So... downside:

The only downside - to some - is that GHLF is ""apart"" from Barcelona in terms of exploring the city and the surrounding regional area.

Bottom line, you're going to be taking taxis at least part of the time (definitely late at night) at between 11-15 euros a ride. That said, compared to the cost of having a rental car in Barcelona (hotel parking charges, city parking charges... the rental charge itself) we're talking chump change. Plus... the taxi ride ""home"" each night is kinda relaxing... at least we found it to be so.

Here's what I'm gonna do folks - I'm gonna map it out for you!

Here's the deal: In the summer months all the public transportation options to get up there are open. ""Off season"" your options are more limited.

Basically, here's the way to get from ""town"" to the top of Tibidabo where the amusement park, cathedral, and most spectacular views of Barcelona and the Mediterranean can be found:

Find your nearest metro stop. Check out the system-wide map. Look for the the FGC S1 and/or S2 lines and if they're not available directly from the metro stop you're at, take the most convenient (other) metro line which will get you to the FGC S1 and/or S2 line.

With me so far...??? Basically what's complicated is that while the Barcelona transit system is integrated, its component systems are labeled individually. More on this later...

Anyway... continuing...

Once you can hop on the FGC S1 or S2 train take this train in the direction of the Peu del Funicula stop and get off there.

Get off the train... follow the signs for and proceed to the Funicular - specifically the Vallvidrera Funicular.

I know what you're saying... you're saying: ""Bill, what the heck is a funicular...?!?!"" Allow me to explain...

A funicular is a cliff railway, a cable railway in which a cable attached to a pair of tram-like vehicles on rails moves them up and down a steep slope; the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalance each other.

A funicular is not a cable car. A funicular is not a tram. A funicular is not a subway car. A funicular is... er... a mode of transportation in and of itself.

So... anyway... hop on the funicular (which is located at the top of the same structure which serves as the metro stop - it's all the same building; you're never leaving the building!) which will take you up the mountain to Vallvidrera Superior.

O.K. Allow me to make this easy for you. The funicular goes up and down. Period. There are no intermediate stops. The lower stop is Vallvidrera ""Minor"" (though they don't label it as such; rather, it simply coincides with the ""Peu del Funicula"" metro stop) while the upper stop is Vallvidrera Superior.

(*ROLLING MY EYES*)

It is confusing, folks. And to add to the confusion, there are actually two distinct and separate funicular lines both heading up Tibidabo mountain - located some distance apart geographically - with the other funicular line reached via a different FGC line (L7) and involving taking what's known as ""the Blue Tram,"" which runs between the metro station ""Ave. Tibidabo"" and the other funicular! This, however, is the route that's only open regularly during the summer months and other peak times. Just FYI!

Oh... and when the amusement park is open... there's also an express bus known as the T-2 which runs between center city's Placa Catalunya metro station and... er... a bus stop adjacent to Gran Hotel La Florida. (Again... the key determining factor on whether this bus exists is whether the park is open or closed; open means bus, closed means no bus.)

O.K., now where were we? Oh, yeah... we've now made it up to Vallvidrera Superior via the open and running all year-round Peu del funicular.

Exit the funicular. Walk out the funicular station doors and emerge facing the street. Turn to your right - to the cross street; the main avenue - and you'll see a red bus stop sign marked ""Barre Bus 111."" The Barre 111 bus (a ""local"" minibus) makes its stop there at 20 minute intervals and it will take you on a five minute drive further up the mountain - directly to the amusement park (or alternately to the Gran Hotel La Florida).

Got all that...?!?!

Seriously... here's all you've gotta know: Off-season, to get from anywhere in Barcelona city proper to the top of Tibidabo and back, you simply need a single metro ticket or a single ride's worth of of a multi-ride ticket. Your ticket will be read by the entry/exit turnstiles you'll pass going on the metro to the funicular to the bus as one uninterrupted ride. The entire trip should take you no more than 40 minutes from city to mountain summit or reverse.

FOLKS... if you've made a reservation at GHLF and have never stayed there are are unfamiliar with Barcelona transit, print out the above ""directions"" and bring them to the hotel with you.

From the airport it's a 38-euro cab ride to the hotel. Why so much when on the map - as the crow flies - the hotel is only 5 or 6 klicks from the airport and Barcelona taxis are reasonably priced? Simple; because you're not driving as the crow flies! 

The same applies to the taxi fares from the end of the metro line proper up to the hotel. You're driving up a mountain - not flying in a straight line. Regardless of whether your catching a cab from the FGC F1/F2 line last stop or or the L7 stop, you're still looking at a 10-12 minute taxi ride from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain.

Anyway... armed with a print-out of the ""directions"" I've just laid out, you'll be able to get your concierge at the hotel to lay out your various options on a map and further explain to you how the timing and seasonal availability (or non-availability) of public transport works.

I know it sounds like a lot, but once you get the hang of it by doing it, it's actually a breeze!

Bottom line: The pros far outweigh the cons of staying at Gran Hotel La Florida. I highly recommend this hotel!

* Oh! And to wrap up the ""directions"" part of this review, here's another recommendation:

You're first full (or near full) day in Barcelona... get a two-day tourist bus pass and on the first day use the tourist bus as a means of ""quick"" initial sightseeing and getting your basic bearings while on the second day utilize the ""hop on, hop off"" feature to really explore Barcelona. The two-day pass is just a few euros more than a single day pass and believe me, combining what your own research has shown you about the city (guidebooks and such) with what the hotel concierge can tell you combined with the tourist bus routes... that will set you up perfectly for getting the most out of your trip to Barcelona.

** Oh... and last but not least... for city metro travel... just get T-10 (ten rides; passes can be shared between multiple users) passes as needed for 7.95 euros a pass. My wife and I averaged going through less than one T-10 pass per day.",5,2010,12,28
28,Everything was perfect.,"Very nice place, great views, a real part of dream, good staff and beautiful facilities. Everything was perfect except the construction noise during the total time, woke up at 7:30 every morning, impossible to sleep in the morning, let alone take a nap, it was the only inconvenience! But all the same size. The view from the dining room very good breakfast. Very good location.",4,2010,12,08
28,Far away from town but a very pretty hotel,I like the hotel a lot and the room is spacious and modern.  It was cold up in the mountain and the wind made it worst.  It was hard to have to take 3 different transportations in order to get to town.  But the view from the room at night looking at the city with all the lights glistering is worth the extra effort.  Everything went well until after I checked out of the hotel and on the way to the airport that I realized I left my Blackberry in the hotel room.  The taxi driver called the hotel for me and asked someone to check the room for my Blackberry.  But it was too late and my Blackberry had vanished within 30 minutes.  I got to the airport and called and asked to make sure they check the room again.  No luck I was told.  I gave the hotel front desk my email address and my work number in case my Blackberry turned up magically.  I have not heard from the hotel management after 2 weeks.  I am surprised that a 5 star hotel would not follow up on an incident like mine.  I find it hard to believe and I have reservation of recommending this hotel to my friends.,4,2010,12,01
28,"Amazing location, good service, good food, lacks maintenance","Amazing location, good service, good food but the building lacks a lot of maintenance which gave us the idea the hotel is not doing to well. Amongst the items to be upgraded is the air conditioning which made a lot of noise. Gran Hotel La Florida is located just below Barcelona's tv tower.
We had a little problem finding the hotel because there was some reconstruction work being done on ther roads towards the hotel.
We only stayed for one night. Maybe we just had the wrong room. It's worth a try however we prefer the W in Barcelona.",3,2010,11,22
28,"A fabulous mountain retreat, wish we were still there!!","My husband, my parents and I ended up at Gran Hotel La Florida after our 12 night cruise (which made it only from Barcelona to Nice) was cancelled the second night out due to a broken rudder. We were lucky the cruise got cancelled!  This hotel was fantastic.  We were there for eleven nights and would have been happy to stay much longer.  We had gorgeous, roomy suites with beautiful views (and that wasn't even the best view they offer).  Watching the magnificent sunsets from out room was spectacular. Our rooms were spotless, and the entire hotel was very well maintained.  The rooms are well appointed and bright.  The entire staff at the hotel were extremely nice and went out of their way to be helpful.  It is a bit of a ride to town, but well worth the trip, which we made once or twice a day.  It was so nice to come back to the room after sightseeing and relax or go to the lovely pool before going to dinner.  Both the restaurant and the bar serve good food and there are many other great choices that are only 10-15 minutes away by taxi.  I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to going back.",5,2010,11,21
28,Wow factor,"What a spectacular hotel! 
It is highly priced but it is very much a top range hotel however, it does price out the noisy elements. 
Very good views, very good food, very good helpful staff while a smile, good pool and a good cardio gym.  
The complimentary shuttle to the city centre adds more value. We can see why a royal family would stay here.",5,2010,11,06
28,"If they sold rooms, I'd buy one today!","This is one of my favorite hotels in the world.  It's incredibly clean, modern, and comfortable. Huge room with luxurious bathroom (including a shower and soaking tub).  A sexy pool and outside lounging area.  Our room had a beautiful balcony with vast views of Barcelona.  The food and the service were impeccable, and I dream of returning!

The only downside is the location.  This place is great if you're looking to relax and casually hit up downtown... but if you have an aggressive tourist check-list, you might be better off staying in the central area.",5,2010,10,24
28,IF ONLY MORE HOTELS WERE LIKE THIS,"Loved it, great service, amazing views, funky sexy hotel with amazing pool. Only down sides - restaurant a bit OTT and not really a walk to Barcelona  - I would recommed this hotel without reservation.",5,2010,10,23
28,Amazing!,"What an amazing hotel. The location is out of this world and the staff were so friendly. We were upgraded to the Sky Terrace which was perfect. The complimentary shuttle service is also very helpful.

I can't wait to spend many more nights at this hotel. Anyone who wants an incredible city break should seriously consider this hotel.",5,2010,10,16
28,Are these reviews for two different hotels?,"it seems that these reviews either love it or hate it and there's no in between. 

Most of the whining seems to come from people who don't like to spend money on travel. This is a five star hotel, not a two star hotel. Things cost more here plain and simple. If you get a deal on the room through Jetsetter don't expect that those levels of savings will magically transfer elsewhere (good grief!). It's also not smack dab in the center of Barcelona. Don't mark them down for picking a location you didn't think through.

The good is beyond good: 

The service here is attentive and the staff remember who you are, and what your preferences are. It's not American style where they come by and check on you ever 5 minutes which is sometimes rough on Americans. If you're on vacation this should be kind of nice once you get used to it. The food is prepared by people who care about quality of ingredients and taste. Delicious.

The location is spectacular. The views are a visual treat as is the property itself. The bar outside is wonderful, the pool and spa are top notch, and L'Organerie is delightful as it comes, and the sommelier is simply brilliant.

If you're worried about the shuttle reserve it in advance by calling them. It won't be a problem. The hotel is outside of town and, yes, a cab is going to cost you €20-30. The last shuttle is at 7:45 at night which is very early by Barcelona standards (the earliest seating at l'Organgerie is 8:30pm). One night we were about 5 mins late for the last shuttle and they waited for us. Well done there. There's also the 111 Barri bus that will take you right outside if you prefer public transport. Apparently take the bus to a cable car which then takes you to the metro and into Barcelona!

Things that need improvement:

The facial in the spa was wonderful, the massage was average at best. There are no proper massage tables, just a skinny recliner with a hole to poke your face through when you flip over. My arms kept falling off as I would relax. I asked for deep tissue and didn't really get that, neither did my companion. Clearly these very nice people are aestheticians first with a bit of massage training. It was far from horrible but just get a facial and skip the massage.

While you can email the front desk replies are a bit spotty. I tried to reserve the shuttle in advance via email and schedule a pick up from the airport (€80 which is about double the price of a cab but it is a lovely chauffeured high end car). In the end I had to call on the day before departure to make these things happen via phone as a couple of emails went unanswered.

All in all this trip was in my top 10 best ever and staying here was a big part of this.",5,2010,10,04
28,horrible hotel experience,"I booked this through Jetsetter.  It was my first experience with Jetsetter and most likely my last.  The service was terrible for starters.  The wall paper was coming off the walls in some places.  The windows are not child safe at all.  The ""free Shuttle"" to town was completely booked all day so we had to pay $50 each way for a cab down to the city. To top it all off,  my husband and I were attacked by bed bugs.  I had over 70 bites on my body.  I didn't know I was bitten until I got home and went to my dermatologist to find out what the itchy bites all over me were coming from.  To finish it off a couple of them hitch hiked their way into my house.  So several thousand dollars later, this mess will be cleaned up.  What a way to end vacation.",1,2010,08,26
28,Relax..Enjoy..and come back again,We spent our honeymoon there I was sorry that it was only 3 days on special rate that included breakfast..would have loved to stay more. Great hotel to spend time on your honeymoon!,5,2010,08,24
28,Avoid like the plague,"We first visited this hotel in it's opening week back in 2003 on our honeymoon and had an amazing meal in the restaurant. We were given a mini tour of the hotel and were hugely impressed by the decor and the sumptuous rooms.

I booked two nights there in February this year as a 40th birthday treat for my husband and to say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement.

The Sunday brunch was appalling and very expensive and there were very few staff on hand. The food in general was very poor and the service non-existant. 

The first night, we ate in the bar area which lacked any sort of atmosphere. My husband sent his soup back as it was cold and tasteless; the waitress came back after about 5 minutes and said that the chef had tasted it and it was fine and she plonked it back on the table in front of him. We refused to pay the bill and walked out, closely followed by the waitress and chef who insisted we pay. My very angry husband adamantly refused and it all got a bit heated. We did not pay in the end.

On the second night, the main restaurant was empty and unwelcoming and the service was slow at dinner. The food was at best average and so overpriced.

It's clear that a hotel management company now runs La Florida with a minimum of staff and very sub-standard general management. Back in the days of Stein Group ownership, I was happy to pay over the odds for the exeptional quality and attentive service.

The rooms are tired and the decor shabby and there was little evidence that anything has been properly maintained.

We actually complained to the acting manager on checking out and she promised that the management team would be in touch. It's not August and not a word.

Do yourself a favour and spend your money somewhere else.",1,2010,08,24
28,Very nice hotel -- fantastic view.  Nice way to recover from NY red-eye!,"I stayed at the La Florida for 1 night with 12 people (we had 4 rooms).  Rooms are terrific -- quite large.  Our favorite rooms were the ones with the beautiful extended decks.  They were less expensive than the JR suite -- and far nicer in my opinion.  What a fantastic way to relax ... a nice cool drink, room service and hanging out watching Barcelona below us.  The pool is lovely.  Unusually clear water -- amazing clear actually.  I loved it as did my kids.  Final note -- we had lunch and dinner here -- also very good.

This is a pricey stay -- but worth it.  I would go again absolutely.",4,2010,08,11
28,Excellent Service,"We stayed here for a long weekend and loved it.  I was a bit apprehensive about the distance from the city, but after arriving I knew we made the right choice.  The infinity pool which is half covered and half outdoors is excellent.   Our room was facing the ocean and the views were breathtaking with Barcelona in the foreground and the ocean beyond.
The hotel food and drinks are a bit on the pricey side but the food was good.  After a long hot day sightseeing in bustling Barcelona, retreating back to the hotel was a very welcomed.  It is about 20-30mins away from Barcelona with taxis costing between 20 - 30 Euros which compared to London taxi prices was a bargain.  
There is a theme park right next to the hotel which you could hear but it really wasn't that bad, the hotel still felt very peaceful.  Its worth taking a walk up to the theme park as there is a beautiful church next to it which is worth a visit.  The best thing about the hotel, apart from the beautiful rooms and excellent bathroom was the service.  All the staff were so helpful and friendly and recommended some great things to do.  If you have some time, it is defiantly worth getting on the train and visiting the small seaside town of Sitges (it takes about 30mins to get there from Sants station), this was a recommendation from one of the waiters.  Thank you to all the staff at the hotel, it ,made our stay.",5,2010,07,28
28,so relaxing after a few nights in Barcelona,"We spent 3 nights on La Ramblas and then retreated up to Gran Florida for 2 nights of chilling.

Amazing service; we were checked in and given 2 glasses of bubbles and a tour of the pool and spa area, then shown to our room.  We booked a Mountain view terrace - there is no view (as per prev. reviews it's trees, a powerline and the entrance) but the room was massive and luxurious, a monster sized bed (after our 2 singles on wheels in the city very welcome!) the shower was huge and the bathroom gorgeous.  While we didn't have the views of the sea-side terraces (which we could enjoy from the pool anyway) we did get the sun - from breakfast to dinner.  Once the pool area lost the sun we'd go back to the room and sit on our loungers until 8.30.  No noise at all from the car park or road.  

It was worth getting the terrace as the restaurant (which is amazing) is basically silver service and night 2 we just wanted to relax (not having wine refilled 1 sip at a time) so ordered room service.  Then we decided to get room service breakfast which was a lot nicer than the buffet.

I would definitely recommend this as the hotel to finish your barcelona stay - you're too far away to really access the city easily (20€), but it's great to do the touristy thing then get out of the craziness and seriously relax somewhere special.  

Never heard a peep from the adventure park next door (although surprised it was there, literally next to the hotel on the hill).  If we had been motivated to leave the poolside we may have checked it out.  I wouldn't let it put you off staying (we were there Mon/Tues)",5,2010,07,24
28,"Hotel Looks Great on Paper, Then Reality Hits","My first hint that I should have canceled my reservation came when I kept emailing the hotel to request information on Barcelona and arrange limo transport to/from the airport and they rarely responded.  Even a phone call to the hotel didn't do the trick.  Finally, my travel agency got the information i needed.

This was the first international trip where i arrived in the morning and I didn't have a room ready for me upon check-in.  I arrived at the hotel around 1115am and I didn't get to my room until almost 2:30pm.  We were told to lounge by the pool for about an hour which turned into several.  No complimentary drinks or food once we left reception either.

The view of Barcelona from the pool is breathtaking, but the moment is continually interrupted by the screams from people enjoying the thrill rides at the amusement park next door.  This is so absurd you have to laugh as people seem to be screaming right over your head.

We booked a Terrace Room with a mountain view.  From our room there was no mountain view....our Terrace Room overlooked the hotel entrance.  Moving was pointless because we were told the hotel was full. We also discovered the door to the adjoining room was unlocked and we could walk into the room next door.  Someone from the hotel had to lock the doors.

While there was no mountain view from the terrace room we could see bushes, the hotel entrance and the street (see pictures).   There was a small architecturally designed waterfall which did a nice job of drowning out the sound of cars and the street,

After we were shown to our room, our hostess told us we needed to book the shuttle if we planned to use it to go into the city.  The shuttle only runs 4 or 5 times a day, and we found it impossible to book seats.  Expect a 20 euro cab ride each way to/from the city centre.

Our first morning, several staff members knocked on our door..we discovered our second night that there are do not disturb signs available -- we just didn't have one in our room and we didn't realize we had to ask.

We were suppose to stay 5 nights, but the logistics to get to the city, the screams from the amusement park, and the parking lot view were just too much.  We checked out after two nights.

After checkout, upon reviewing my amex statement, i noticed the hotel charged me for our last day spa use even though we had a 80 euro credit and the spa should have been free.  We were also charged for round trip limo even though we only used the limo to get to the hotel from the airport.

For a five-star, boutique hotel this place was very disappointing.

The hotel itself is very charming, but it's extremely isolated and the amusement park destroys the ambiance during the day.",2,2010,07,18
28,Fabulous Hotel- Great Service - Great Food- Amazing Views,"My boyfriend (now fiancee) and I stayed in this hotel in May. Barcelona is mine and my fiancee's favorite city (in fact he proposed right by the hotel - at this cathedral Sagrat Cor).
The service was excellent- it couldn't have been better. The outdoor heated pool and terrace were amazing. The food on the outdoor terrace was delicious. 
I recommend staying here on a second trip to Barcelona - because it is quite far from the city centre and a 20 euro cab ride- or you have to plan your entire day around their shuttle service- which only runs till 7pm.  
On our trip, we stayed in the hotel all day- laid out on the terrace and ordered food and in the evening we went to the City to eat dinner and hang out. 
Suggestions: Cabs can get very expensive. Book the free shuttle to the City but make sure you book in advance because spots run out. The shuttle only runs from 10am to 7pm. You can also take a cab to the metro which is 10 euro. Get the 10 trips tickets for the metro- it ends up working out to 7 euros for all 10 trips. If you take a cab from the city back to the hotel-make sure you ask the cab driver if he knows where the hotel is (we had an issue with this- the hotel is in the town of Tibidabo). The cab from the city to the hotel is approx. 20 euro - 25 euro. There is also the option of taking the bus- T2- which is next to the hotel and runs on weekends to placa catalunya (city centre). The T2 bus stops running from the City at around 9pm and also 9pm from the hotel ( when the amusement park closes). I recommend seeing Sagrat Cor (the cathedral next to the hotel) - not bc I was proposed to there :-) - but because it is the highest point and the view from the top is absolutely amazing. I love this hotel and will return next year sometime. I couldnt have stayed at a better place. There is also an amusement park next door (its the one in the movie - Vicki Christina Barcelona). We didn't go to the amusement park but regret not riding the ferris wheel. Also there is free wi-fi in the hotel. So you can also use your wireless phone.",5,2010,05,30
28,Fabulous Views but extortionate prices for food and drinks - a real pity.,"My husband and I stayed here on a short break to Barcelona.  We have to agree by saying the views from the hotel are fabulous.  Also, our room was very nice - two windows with great views.  Hotel is generally very impressive, although a little jaded in parts - e.g. the spa which needs a good coat of paint (mould around the upper window frames - wooden floors which were badly scratched).
Yes, the shuttle bus only holds six and is often booked.  We found our way round on public transport - first - a bus outside the hotel down to the next village - then take the funicular railway down to the metro - then the metro into the centre (got that!).  We quite enjoyed this, but we are mobile and enjoy this sort of thing.  However,, the last funicular is at 9.00 pm, so no late nights.  The last hotel mini bus also returns at 8.45 pm.  This means you must get a taxi, which is approx. 20 euros one way.  We did this on the last night, but it would have been costly every night.
We didn't have breakfast - we bought our own croissants and fruit from a supermarket in Barcelona centre - no shops or cafes near the hotel - apart from the theme park cafe which wasn't very nice.  Breakfast in your room is 32 euros each - coffee is 7 euros per cup.  On the last day we stayed around the pool, but felt frustrated because of the cost of the food.  It was 21 euros each for a burger - similar prices for sandwiches (this is how we came to walk up to the theme park cafe which was very poor and was only half open).  The whole food problem meant that we had to eat our own 'imported' breakfast., get down to the town centre for lunch and then stay there all day - have our evening meal and then do the return - metro, funicular, bus journey.  For anyone less mobile I think this would be a problem and would be very tiring.  It also means you can't go back midday to change.  We knew the hotel was out of town, but it's not 15 minutes away as they state - it was closer to 30 minutes on the mini bus and the public transport route is complicated - which no-one tells you.  Our main frustration was due to the fact that we weren't prepared to pay the prices they charge for food.  Don't get me wrong, we have been lucky enough to stay in some fabulous hotels in our time - and we're not mean - but we really felt as if they saw us literally as a 'captive' audience.  I can't understand why they don't make the prices more reasonable and then people would stay around the hotel and the pool and there would be more atmosphere.
All in all - the hotel is very impressive in parts - the views are fantastic - but we won't be back.",3,2010,05,28
28,"Super View, but lots of problems","We stayed at this hotel due to its being part of Leading Hotels and descriptions from Trip Advisor.
All reviews about the view are absolutely correct. The hotel's location overlooking Barcelona is spectacular and a wonderful place to have a drink or dinner overlooking the city.
But, the location is also a very costly problem.  The hotel advertises that is has a free shuttle.  However, the shuttle was not available at reasonable times, because it is a van and holds only 4-5 people.  It was fully booked at all day times and does not run in the mid-afternoon at all.  So, we ended up with a 20 - 30 Euro cab ride each way to and from anything we wanted to do in the city. It's about a 30 minute trip.
The room we had was large and had a wonderful view of the sea.  However, the television did not work, and it took more than 1 hour to fix it. The maid did not leave soap for the shower and there were no face cloths.
 The worst part was when I got in the shower, the entire shower apparatus came crashing out of the wall and fell on the floor!  The room obviously had not been maintained.
Because of the location of the hotel, I had emailed them three days before our arrival asking if they had a car and driver that could pick us up at the cruise terminal. I asked the price and how we would find the driver - with a sign? at a certain location?  
I never received an email back. No information or quote on the price. I assumed they did not provide the service.  So I never confirmed a car and driver with them.  When we arrived at the cruise terminal in Barcelona, we disembarked, walked out and got in a cab.  There was noone there with a sign with our name or a car and driver for us.
When we arrived at the hotel, we mentioned this and the desk clerk said, ""But I sent a driver - I emailed you.""  I said we had never heard from them and never confirmed the pickup as we did not know the cost.""  He said, "" I took it on myself to book the car for you. You must pay for it.""  We said we would not pay as we had not confirmed the pickup and had not gotten a ride. We took a 35 Euro cab instead.  He absolutely refused to remove the 90 euro charge from our bill.  We will dispute this with our credit card company.
In addition, we had booked a package that included buffet breakfast.  Because we had to leave before the restaurant opened, the desk clerk said he would have a continental breakfast sent up to our room instead. We thought this a nice gesture.  When the breakfast arrived - coffee, juice, pastries - the room service person handed us a bill for 56 Euros.  We said breakfast was included - she said, ""not in your room.""  We didn't eat a bite but took the bill down to the front desk. It took 20 minutes to get this straightened out.  
We had ordered a cab for our departure to the airport.  Because it took more than 20 minutes to get the bill straightened out (and yes it still included the car and driver cost), the cab starting fee had climbed to 10 Euros before we even left.  
The hotel was quite empty.  I understand why. 
There are other great hotels in Barcelona. I recommend staying in one of them. I certainly will next time.",2,2010,05,19
28,Best View Ever!,A wonderful splurge after our cruise. Restaurant was priced too high. Shuttle to downtown. Sacre Cur and Tibidabo park just a walk away. And the view from the room was wonderful!,5,2010,04,09
28,WOW! what a beautiful place to stay,"an extended stay taking in arsenal f c champions league game
so good the barca galacticos stayed there!
small but classically appointed with mountain top views down on the city from the outside infinity pool while enjoying a cerveza or cava
magnificent rooms with top quality tv/audio setup big comfy beds and service fit for a king(and thierry henry)
bit of a trek to town though but worth it
not cheap but really good value.",5,2010,04,09
28,Top Experience - and great staff.,"Having read some of the negative reviews on this site, I can't say that my experience mirrored those. We had a wonderful time. I travelled to the hotel with my other half and toddler for a long weekend in March 2010, mainly to get away from the awful winter weather in the UK and hoping for some sun. I was attracted to the fact that the hotel had an indoor pool (a rarity in Barcelona) which meant that even if the weather was a bit rubbish we could use the spa and pool.
From start to finish we had a great experience - only a few things annoyed me (more later). First - location. 15 minutes from the airport, at the top of a hill overlooking Barcelona. Trust me, the photos on the website and even the ravings of those of us who have been there don't do it justice. It is a truly magnificent, 180 degree view, which takes in the whole of Barcelona and on a clear day it was pointed out to us that the islands we could see in the distance were the Balearics! Stunning and well worth spending the extra cash on a sea view room.
We stayed in a junior suite (separate sleeping area for junior) which was on a corner and therefore had a splendid view to the front and the side - I could have just stared at the view all day. Massive bathroom with the biggest shower I have ever seen, including a small child-sized shower attachment (trust me, if you have kids, this is a great thing). Truly comfortable beds.
The pool area/jacuzzi were stunning - very long pool, could have done with being a bit more heated but overall lovely. Did not swim outside as it was a bit too cold.
Did not eat in the Orangerie as it seemed really pricey but no one tried to pressure us into it and there is a lobby bar which serves food all day so if you just fancy some tapas and a cocktail, you can eat there for a fraction of the price.
Yes, the hotel is a bit out of Barcelona and we were a bit peeved off to find that the shuttle minibus thing was booked up every single day and we had to get a cab. I'd definitely recommend booking this a few days before you arrive. but a taxi was very easy - 10 minutes down the hill - 20 euros approx each way and we had no trouble finding someone to bring us back. In many ways being out of town means a completely peaceful and tranquil hotel experience.
Staff were really phenomenal. On our last day, we woke up to find a covering of snow - which meant it was impossible for a taxi to come up and get us to take us to the airport (don't worry, this is very rare apparently!). The hotel were fab, commandeered the shuttle to take us to the bottom of the hill and arranged for a taxi to meet us there. Also when our toddler was ill, the hotel staff sorted out medicine for him and were on call for calling a doctor and all sorts. overall, very nice staff.

I guess my only gripes would be the price of all the extras. The room rate was very reasonable indeed. But 36 euros EACH for breakfast? We had a look at breakfast and it did not seem worth it - instead we go a cab into town and had breakfast down there, all much cheaper and more pleasant anyway. Room service was also nasty - 25 euros for sandwiches, 30 euros for a salad - and if you are eating in because you have a baby sleeping, this adds up no end. One night we thought we'd try to get a babysitter but the price quoted was 25 euros an hour, plus taxes plus 50 euros for a taxi  - which would have been about 150 euros for the night - no thanks!
But if you can avoid the extras, then this is a fabulous hotel. Quiet, friendly, beautiful and well run. Have fun.",4,2010,03,09
28,The Best Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is an old Hospital that's located at the top of the Tibidabo Mountain In Barcelona. It was completely redone and it its I believe less than 50 Rooms. From up there you can see the Entire city and of Barcelona, It only takes 15 to 20 mints in a Taxi to get there from the Airport. 

The Service, Location, Food is Superb. I have done my share of traveling, and this is so far the Best of the Best.",5,2010,03,05
28,Couldn't be better!!,"Having looked on trip advisor, we were slightly worried about chosing this hotel as some of the reviews were quite negative. However, we needn't have worried because this hotel is absolutely fabulous.

We upgraded to have a city view room and this was stunning. Although the hotel is a 10 min taxi ride from the city centre, the view both at night time and in the day, made this totally worth it. The rooms have balconies so you can sit out and take in the scenery and, even in winter, it's warm enough to be out there at night time. Rooms are clean, spacious and the bathrooms are beautiful!

Previous reviews had suggested that the staff weren't very friendly or helpful, however, we found the complete opposite. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. 

We didn't eat at the restaurant as it is very expensive and you can get better value for money down in the city centre. Also, the rooms didn't have kettles which was a shame as we'd brought tea bags with us (typical british!!). However, we just rang room service every day and they brought up a jug of boiling water. My advice - take a travel kettle!

Overall, this was the best hotel i've ever stayed in on a city break. Taxi fares are about 20 euros into the town centre but the hotel runs a free shuttle service down into the city centre which was very convenient and reliable (it's a mercedes people carrier, not a mini bus as the name suggests!)

I would highly recommend this hotel to couples looking for a romantic break to an amazing city and a hotel with true 5 star facilities and atmosphere.

Visit the magic fountain!!!",5,2010,01,03
28,what a change!!,"So we returned to Hotel Gran la florida, and it was so much better than  one+ yearago. The room was upgraded  to a beautiful city/sea view, with a large terrace and lounges, table and chairs, big room, immaculate,etc. The service was outstanding, and the staff extremely helpful. They have added a cozy  lounge area making it far more inviting.And of course the view is still amazing.I am sure we will return.",5,2009,11,17
28,Expensive hotel - lovely room -awesome view - facilities were closed,"This hotel is set up in the hillside of Barcelona - taxi's charge extra to go up the hill - 40 euros to the airport and from the dock yard.
We booked the hotel because of the Spa and pool.  They had a special for 155 eruo on the website. We called to confirm. They raised the rate on Saturday night to 255 Eruo's but we wanted to have the pool and spa.  When we arrived we were told that the Spa was rented out for a wedding and that we could not use the Spa /pool hot tub on that Saturday night. Which was the reason we booked the hotel. The staff would not give a discount to 155 on the room nor did that offer a breakfast.. nothing - too bad.

So please confirm that you have the use of the facilities prior to booking. Make sure you have taxi fare.  Breakfast is 28 eruo per person and tea is 8 eruo.

Beauitful view, and room and the Spa and pool is lovely. They have a free shuttle from the hotel to downtown you need to book prior to going.",3,2009,10,23
28,"Wanted to like it, but too overpriced and wannabe trendy","My partner and I stayed here for a romantic getaway over a long weekend. I'd researched barcelona intently and thought this best suited our needs (to be able to relax, but also enjoy Barcelona's culture).

Our stay was okay, but unfortunately, it didn't really tick either boxes. The hotel is too far from Barcelona for ease (30 minutes each way) and if you wanted to stay out and relax, you had to get the credit card out. The cheapest pool lunch you could get was a £6 mini bottle of coke and a £22 small, frozen pizza. I don't take umbrage at the cost of the food in a 5 star hotel, just that the quality was poor and the drinks were very overpriced.

The hotel has a very architectural looking pool and spa area, but a lot of it wasn't working when we went (cleopatra baths, ice baths, steam room etc).

The hotel itself was well styled and the building was lovely - very spacious and airy. The rooms were decent, the bathrooms cavernous, but the hot water was unreliable and scalding / freezing in turn every 30 seconds. Our tv only showed channels in a green tint, I'm not sure if the reception was bad or if it was just our machine though.

My overall feeling was that it's not living up to its star rating - maybe a 3.5star. The decor is lovely, but the edges are a bit ragged if you know what I mean....just something missing. The atmosphere was a bit strange, but maybe I'd just been reading too much Carlos Ruiz Zafon??",3,2009,10,11
28,Ammazing,"I really liked the hotel one of the best hotels ive been in  , the service was good and the view was unbelievable its a bit far from the city a 20 min cab ride but its worth it , you can go to the city have fun enjoy but at night you go to this ammazing hotel far away relaxed place , i really like it the room service was good the pool is ammazing , but i didnt like the restaurant food :) i prefer eating outside local rest and food , i liked the Amusment park it was so nice if your there go to KRUGER house game :p and let me know after you been to this game :)",5,2009,09,05
28,Disastrous,"We had booked to stay 3 nights as part of our honeymoon but checked out after just one night. Because of the heavy rain we could not appreciate the views and without those there is absolutely no justification for the 5 star status. The manager was rude and unhelpful when i expressed disappoinment with the room. Although we had gone for an upgrade to a terraced room, it as like a large cell- cold and uninviting. The bathrooms are lovely though. Be wary of loud music from the bar beneath the terraced rooms. There was no cosy lounge which would entice you to curl up with a book on a wet day- in fact there were draughts and towels on the ground soaking up the rain downstairs. Dinner was a disgrace-One restaurant was closed and the other booked out albeit that we were residents. This should have been explained to us when we were shown around on check in. extremely disappointing.",1,2009,09,01
28,Probably the Nicest Hotel with a View in the World,"On top of Tibadabo and the background for the amusement park scene in Vicky Christina Barcelona, this is one spectacular property.  An indoor/outdoor stainless steel pool, terraced patio area and an unobstructed view of the entire city and Mediterranean.  Truly five star hotel.  Restaurant was closed for remodel but the Tour De France came very near the hotel one morning.  Made up for everything else.  Down side is that if you want to be close to the Rambla and the city, this is a 25 euro ride up the hill.  But they have shuttles that take you down and pick you up that go all day and stop in the evening.  I have stayed at this property three times in the last two years and it is a destination for me now.  If you have one of the AMEX cards with a certain color, you are likely to get upgraded to a better room, junior suite or the tower suite.  Same staff each time.  Great for solo break even as you can totally chill and decompress.",5,2009,08,21
28,"Beautiful Views, Great Facilities, Indifferent Staff/Food","Stayed 4 nights at this hotel and the views are breathtaking when you first arrive. Oddly, there is a fairground next door, which can be slightly offputting first of all, when you are laying on your sunlounger and can hear screams from people on the rides. However, you do stop noticing it after a while, so don't let this put you off.
It is about a 25 euro taxi drive in the centre of Barcelona and although the hotel does have a bus shuttle service, it was always booked when we wanted it, even by calling a couple of days in advance plus, there seemed some significant gaps in the times they departed/returned. There also seems to be a bus (T2) that goes by the hotel from the city centre, so that might be worth looking at, although we didn't try it.
The spa and pool are excellent and the rooms are spacious and well equipped.
I highly recommend you book a package with breakfast included, as we didn't (it wasn't an option on the deal) and it can cost 28 euros each, as we found to our expense the first morning. However, you can get coffee and pastries at the bar for a more reasonable 12 euros.
As the hotel has 48 rooms, the loungers are at a premium and so unfortunately, you tend to have to resort to placing your towel on them early in the morning before breakfast. 
The food is OK, but pricey, compared to what is on offer in town. The best lunch was the burger! The salads have a lot of lettuce and not much else and the choice is limited. Re evening meal, we had the BBQ the first night and again at 45 euros each, it was quite poor, as you only had two kebab sticks each and a small salad.
Finally, the staff. Some were excellent, others were moody and seemed to be doing you a favour. Also, the pool bar closes at 1am, which is very early and I know they are probably worried about noise upsetting guests, but this is probably the earliest you'll get back to the hotel after a meal and so having some options for evening drinks is expected in a hotel of this quality. There did appear to be a nightclub downstairs, but it wasn't open while we were there and not sure I wanted that anyway!
Overall, a great hotel, which just needs a few tweaks to food, staff & facilities to make it truely excellent.",4,2009,08,13
28,An Expensive But Worthwhile Treat,"We spent two nights here prior to a cruise and are glad we treated ourselves with this escape up the mountain above Barcelona.  If the limited shuttle isn't available, it's only a 17 Euro cab ride down to the main attractions of the Old City and La Rambla.  The view is amazing, especially from inside the most attractive (indoor-outdoor) pool we've ever enjoyed.  The staff was very helpful as we dealt with lost luggage and other smaller requests.  The drink prices are staggering, but that's about the only bad thing I can say.  After the cruise we spent a night down on the pier at the Eurostars Grand Marina just to be closer to La Rambla and the airport.  Both hotels, like most of the city, are exceptionally tourist friendly making Barcelona a perfect choice for our vacation hub.",4,2009,08,04
28,Fantastic hotel,"The booking service for my job put us in this hotel. At first, we were worried that it was so far away from downtown. However, when we arrived, we didn't want to leave! The service was great from the moment we arrived. We had forgotten to get euros at the airport and my colleague went inside to change some money to pay the taxi. A few minutes later, a lady from the front desk came running out and grabbed our bags and insisted we come in and the hotel would take care of the bill. She went and paid the taxi for us and said they would just add it to our bill. Then, they automatically upgraded us to views overlooking the city. It was just amazing when we went to our rooms. The rooms were absolutely spectacular. We had drinks at the poolside bar and just relaxed on that amazing terrace that overlooks the city. Tibidabo is next door but wasn't a distraction at all. We ate dinner later that night on the terrace and had the nightly barbeque. It is quite a wait as there are only five tables and they don't hurry you out at all. If you're an impatient person, you definitely won't like this but we again just enjoyed the view and wine from the bar. Once we were seated, we were the last customers for the barbeque and they gave us an extra plate and a half of the main entree for free since we had to wait so long. The next day when we had to check out, we waited until the very end because it was so relaxing. I will definitely recommend this to anyone and plan to come back on holiday with my husband. Also, free wifi and free computers in the lobby area. The pool is amazing too; I didn't have enough time to enjoy it.",5,2009,08,02
28,Great place on the top of Barcelona!,"An amazing view of Barcelona from the hotel room or restaurants. The shuttle (free) is very convient to go in center of Barcelona. Food is quite good but overpriced...you could discover very nice restaurants in Barcelona for cheaper price and much quality.
Service was quite friendly and nice with young waiters and waitresses. We recommend to take the shuttle for your day discovery and a taxi to come back late at night!!!.
Could be noisy due to poximity of Tibidabo amuzing parc.
We will come back to this place in the future.",4,2009,07,24
28,Great views dreadful service,"Before we arrived the service was great. I had booked the restaurant for dinner sat/sun, i had mentioned that it was a special occasion, i had seen the website and upon arrival all seemed fine. The hotel looked amazing, the view from our room was amazing, the mojito was delicious. Unfortunately the following day teh cracks appeared. It started with a droning noise which turned out to be from the fun park next door. That was followed by a wedding that caused us to be moved, then the waitress at the bar gave my wife a glass dripping with rose...that literally dripped all over my wifes white trousers. On complaining all the staff smiled politely until one of them decided salt and water would solve the problem. Next minute she was dousing my stunned wife with salt! Dinner was uneventful and the food was good albeit vastly overpriced. The following day all the sun beds were taken with the previous nights wedding guests. That evening we tried the bbq as you are unable to eat from the bar menu...again vastly overpriced. That was followed by more inattentiveness from the staff. The following day the bill was wrong. When told of all our problems, our complaints and disappointment the girl at the desk smiled politely, shrugged her shoulders and left us standing there. I will not revisit unless something dramatic happens to improve the service of this over priced, over valued average hotel. The view was great though!",2,2009,07,02
28,Beware theme park next door!,"Billed as an Urban Spa, we were a bit disappointed in this hotel although it is in a spectacular setting with amazing views from the terraced area at the back of the building. We didn’t realise it is right next door to a theme park which is screened by a fence but you can still hear screaming kids on the rollercoaster rides. The amusement park is also being extended and there were bulldozers tearing up the ground a few feet
from where we were sitting which wasn’t very relaxing. Sadly there were also roadworks on the other side of the hotel at the front, and our room overlooked the entrance so we were woken by diggers and workmen at 8.00am each morning - not very relaxing. But spotlessly clean, huge, comfy beds and perfectly serviceable rooms though without any UK TV - the hotel seems a bit dated in parts: lots of black slate everywhere and dim lighting. Overall the service was patchy and although the shuttle bus was excellent and saved us the huge cost of a taxi into Barcelona each day, you have to book quickly as there are only six seats on each trip and it gets very busy. The hotel is small and there is little outside space for sitting in the evening - it gets quite chilly at night so remember to take something warm to wear! It is also very pricey - we paid 28 euros for a continental breakfast and 15 euros for a gin and tonic which we felt was eye wateringly expensive - and we are used to the prices of hotels like the Anassa in Cyprus, which is truly a 5 star spa hotel. Still, we enjoyed Barcelona and if you can get a discounted price from somewhere like lastminute.com and are prepared for the noise factor, it is still worth a visit. Eat out, use the free shuttle bus and take your own Bombay Sapphire and tonic!",3,2009,06,28
28,Superb Valentines Treat!,"This was a surprise valentines trip organised by my husband, on route from the airport I could see this fabulous building at the top of Mount Tibidabo and mentioned how wonderful it would be to stay there and I was thrilled to find that we were going to!

With amazing view across the city from the decked area with comfy seating areas nestled here and there, the sun came out and it felt like a summers day…perfect.  

Our room looked out onto the same view, it had a large bathroom, bedroom with french doors onto the balcony and a seating area.  We were lucky enough to enjoy 2 nights here and had a fabulous breakfast served in our room on our last morning.

We enjoyed a lovely meal on the first evening, everything was first class and they were very accommodating to any requests regarding changes to the set menu.

Yes it was expensive, but 5 star hotels tend to be and given it was valentines weekend no doubt the prices were hiked up even more!  But it was an experience I will not forget and of course Barcelona itself was amazing, what a way to experience it for the first time!",4,2009,06,22
28,Best hotel I have ever stayed in.,"From our driver who picked us up at the airport to our room and the awesome views and rosewater greeting, every moment of our stay was perfection.  The hotel arranged a private car for a tour of Barcelona and we were fortunate enough to have Senor Bai, the owner of the service and a wonderful gentleman give us the ""insider's"" view of the city.
Thanks to the concierge we saw a beautiful city and enjoyed a wonderful stay with terrific service.  We will be back....This review is much delayed as I was searching for La Florida for future reservations and came across TripAdvisor and had the opportunity to share our experience.  You will never find this experience in the downtown hotels of Barcelona or anywhere in the U.S. You get what you pay for at this hotel.",5,2009,06,21
28,Nice but expensive,"We travelled to Barcelona to meet up with some friends for a birthday celebration and they chose this hotel. On arrival we were greeted by the staff who gave us a complimentary drink and showed us around the hotel. The terrace has the most amazing views over the city as did our room which was perfectly acceptable for a 4 star, but not really 5 star. The bath rooms were spacious, but the shower temperature was a nightmare constantly changing between freezing and tepid at best. 
The award for the worst room service must go to this hotel. We ordered breakfast the first morning and after a hour we phoned to find out where it was and the guy who answered said they forgot to ask for the room number so they didn't make it. Ok, mistakes happen, he did arrive 15 mins later with a bottle of complimentary cava. The next morning we ordered again, the waiter arrived with the breakfast but without any cutlery , milk or butter! The breakfast was €56 each. The toast was cold and dry, the bacon and eggs were cold. The following morning (our last) pretty much the same thing happened again, and I met one of our friends on the stairs because we were both trying to catch the waiter as we both had been served without any tea cups, milk, butter etc!
Having said that, sunday brunch food was good, but the drinks were just monstrously expensive. €14 for a Bloody Mary, same for a glass of wine.
I think they charge so much for drinks because the hotel is quite isolated and they haven't got to compete with any other bars.
One other thing, there is a theme park close to the hotel - and you can hear people shouting and screaming quite clearly from the rooms and the terrace throughout the day.
Gran Hotel La Florida - good, but not good enough.",4,2009,06,17
28,Super righteous!,"**I do apologize that this review has just been posted.  I'm a world traveler and I've just started to use Tripadvisor for advice when choosing hotels or restaurants. So because so many reviews has helped me...I figured I'd give back! Okay, now on to the review...

This hotel was perfectly situated in the clouds of Barcelona. I arrived a few hours early and my room was not quite ready, so the staff (who were very pleasant if I may add) held my luggage and provided me with a complimentary drink while I waited for my room. They gave me a tour of the facility and provided me with information about the hotel as well as the city. I had lunch out on the terrace, and by the time I finished, my room was all set. When I arrived to my room, I was baffled by the breath taking views from the balcony. 
The room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower and the bath was soothing. The room was so relaxing, that I did not even leave my room the first night...(please be aware that I was very eager to see the city, but the bed wouldn't allow me too)The room service was decent, although expensive. Breakfast for 1(small bowl of fruit, green tea, omelette, pineapple juice, oatmeal, and toast) $50 bucks...no exaggeration!! I also ordered dinner from room service and again it was decent, it was also very late coming up to my room.  I ordered the ravioli and ended up having to eat it with no sauce because they brought up sauce with meat, and I specifically asked for a vegetarian sauce. I'm not the type to complain though...I just think it was a communication barrier, but overall, the room service agents were very nice as well as the housekeepers! 
I didn’t get a chance to take advantage of the pool and spa. Because I was only in Barcelona for a couple days, but I'm sure it was relaxing. I also didn’t utilize the free shuttle, service into the city, because they had specific times when they left and returned to the hotel, so I opted to use the taxi services, so I could go as I pleased (its about 20-25 Euro one way). 
Some people complained about the drive to and from the city, and about how far the hotel was from everything. I beg to differ...the drive wasn’t bad, it would take me 15-20 minutes to get to the city center, and the taxi ride was pleasant. Taxi drivers were friendly and very conversational.  I speak only a little Spanish, but I can understand the language very well, so we had some interesting conversations. 
Overall, if you’re looking to be in the midst of the hustle and bustle, don’t stay at this hotel. But if you’re trying to relax in a hotel thats situated on top of a hill that boasts beautiful views of the city of Barcelona and want to be treated like a king or queen, I recommend you stay here.

Some valuable information: I noticed that I was the only single at this hotel. One might feel out of place if you’re there alone, but again, if you’re like me, and you just want to enjoy life and be treated like royalty, checking in alone will not make you feel out of place. I was in Barcelona to visit a good friend for his birthday, but the next time I go, I will be accompanied by my girlfriend, because it is an experience that you should share with someone.",5,2009,05,24
28,What a view!,"We stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon and it was perfect!  Gorgeous views, quiet and very romantic.  If you are looking to be in the center of the city than this place isn't for you, though they do offer a shuttle service to and from the hotel.",5,2009,05,12
28,Not as Good as We were Expecting,"After reading some reviews on TA we were very much looking forward to our Stay in barcelona.  Barcelona is awsome, the people are great.  However the hotel was not up to the standards we expected.

On arrival, from a long flight from the US, we turned up in a taxi cab to arrive to a locked door, no-body to greet us.  We waiting outside in the cold and wind for about 5 mins before someone 'greeted' us, although the 'greet' was more like a scowl.   I felt like a bit of a nuisance to be there although we were on time and not too early.   We sat in silence at reception, no welcome, or dink to greet us - very poor from a 5-star hotel.

The hotel room was beauiful, big, clean and spacious with a very big shower but there were cigerattes on the balcony.   

The food and the restaurant staff was amazing.

All-in-All a nice hotel that needs a bit of an over-haul in terms of decorating and some of the service, and a few finer touches could be added to mak it a real 5-star accomodation.    

Some of the interior look rather run-down also.   

Shame as there were beautiful views of the City at Night time.",3,2009,01,12
28,Terrible location,"it was supposed to be the best hotel in Barcelona, but...

It is just too far away from the city itself. No way to walk around the area. It is either renting a car or a taxi. It does have some amazing views, but definitely too far away.",2,2008,12,30
28,"Very nice hotel, but...","A very nice hotel with superb views overlooking Barcelona. The service was good overall, the room and bathroom were both beautiful and very comfortable, and he pool area (both indoor and outdoor) is truly superb. 

That being said, I found that the hotel never got things 100% right. It never pushed its offering to reach true 5 star level: the rooms, despite being very nicely designed, are already showing signs of wear (parquet scratched, holes in the lamp shades, temperature of the water in the shower can be temperamental, some light bulbs not working properly). The same goes for service: it was always polite, but not always friendly or genuine. While I had a very nice time overall, I still cannot say that the hotel has any ""wow"" factor or that you feel particularly ""looked after and pampered"". It seems to me almost as if the hotel staff politely provides the ""minimum required"", but does not really go out of the way to make your stay truly memorable. 

The location is good for those wanting to have some down time and relax by the pool. For those looking to max out their visiting time in Barcelona, it would probably be better to stay in the city itself. The hotel has a free shuttle at regular intervals, but 

1) the timing is not always convenient
2) it takes about 30 minutes to get to/from the city
3) the last shuttle back is at 7:45 p.m.
4) it is nice to be able to come back to hotel in the middle of the day to rest up for a little while, or drop your shopping bags. You could not really do that at La Florida because the hotel is just too far away. 
5) the shuttle only accommodates 6 guests, so in high season, you may not get on and would be forced to take a taxi 

Overall, a very good hotel, but still needs to improve a bit to be truly 5 star.",4,2008,12,13
28,"Location, location, location","As other reviewers note, this hotel has fabulous views over Barcelona. In all other respects it is not what it claims to be, e.g. the best address in Catalunya or, for that matter, a world leading hotel. A great deal of effort and no doubt money has gone into the ""design"" aspect, yet the result is peculiarly lacking in personality and the finish is poor close-up. The giant water features are somehow reminiscent of a shopping mall. My junior suite was more simply bare than, say, deliberately minimalist, and the wooden floors were severely gouged by furniture being dragged about. The restaurant produces complicated food in tiny portions with amazingly little flavour for the amount of work that went into it, and at high prices. Service is charming but youthfully inefficient and though the ""service my room"" card hung on the door of my suite all day - on a busy landing, not hidden away in a corridor - the room was only actually serviced at 7 p.m.

So, provided you can get a good rate, go for the views - but in that case, why not just go for lunch? The place is too far from town to be a convenient base for visiting Barcelona.",3,2008,10,11
28,What a view!,"The hotel Gran la Florida truly exceeded our expectations. Our room was very luxurious with two balconies and fabulous views over to the mountains and to the city. We were here on our honeymoon and we didn't want to leave the hotel although it was our first time in Barcelona.

The Spa's pool area was spectacular and the whirlpool had very warm water.

The hotel is a bit far from the city, but it offers complimentary shuttle service. Breakfast was ok, but not as luxurious as you would wait from a five star hotel. The staff was great: very helpful and always with a smile. 

Gran la Florida offered really good value for the money and we will definitely come back here.",5,2008,09,25
28,over price,"we have just been to la gran florida fo two days , we had a deluxe room with view on the parking , view to attraction parc
it shouldn't be a deluxe room.the room was noisy and  awful view,,,,
service is ok but it should be better for a leading hotel , they forgot few things during the breakfast
we had two lunch at the snack , the food is not bad but its not good either it just ok , its quite exepnsive fo Barcelona. we order some tapas and hamburger , all food was just ok , nothing really good...
I don t mind  to pay at all but Iam expecting a better service and qualite..

28,Sunday Cava brunch!,"We love this place - even though we only live 40 km away in Sitges, we go there for the all you can drink cava brunch on a Sunday - a fabulous buffet, all you can drink cava, and stunning views over the whole of Barcelona.  Only this time instead of falling into a taxi to take us home, my partner booked a room for us to stay in.  The room was beautifully furnished, although it was beginining to look like it needed a few little touch ups.  The view was stunning over the Med and the National Park.  The staff were gracious and pleasant, which beleive me, in Catalonia is definitely not the norm.  Next day a hearty breakfast and a dip in the beauutiful metalic infinity pool, followed by a lunchtime Mojito.  I love it!",5,2008,09,01
28,The most sexy and beautiful hotel in Spain,"This hotel is beautifully located in on the heights of Barelona with spectacular views..the hotel is amazing,from the rooms to the the decor of the public areas and fantastic outdoor pool and terrace, this is by far the only place to stay in Barcelona.
The place is so sexy and welcoming, a real luxury hotel with a very hip and warm atmosphere.
The classiest place ever..",5,2008,08,29
28,2nd anniversary at Gran Hotel La Florida,"We celebrated our second anniversary here and were very pleased with the hotel. The staff were excellent and we had a lovely welcome upon arrival.  The setting of the hotel is fabulous and in the evening can be seen from miles away due to the cathedral opposite being lit up at night.
Breakfast was lovely and the croissants were to die for! We had dinner in the orangerie restaurant which was very nice but did not warrant the 170 euro price tag!
Generally, the drinks and food are very expensive here and a cab into town is around 20-25 euros.  We knew about booking the shuttle service so did that ok as there are only six people per trip so you need to book in advance. Last trip back to the hotel is about 8pm so you are restricted unless you want to get a cab back.
Did not feel comfortable walking around Barcelona, partic around Las Ramblas and be aware of Ravel, very dodgy!
The stainless steel swimming pool was great and had no problem getting a sun lounger!
Good points are lovely hotel, great position at top of mountain, facilities and staff.  Bad points are price of food and drinks and conveniance to centre of town.",4,2008,08,21
28,"Nice room and spa, some service problems","Nicely renovated hotel, blending modern style with Art Nouveau. Lovely large room with seating area, great view of Barcelona and a gorgeous bathroom (huge separate shower). Very high standards of housekeeping.

The spa is superb, with an indoor/outdoor steel pool, saunas and a good fitness room.

The service had some of the greatest contrasts I have ever seen: world class at the front door and the reception, terrible (very young and inexperienced) in the restaurants, the bar and the spa. The food ranged from average to bad, including the breakfast buffet (mini jars of Hero jam!).

The location is great if you want to get away from the city for a few days, but it is not good  for visiting Barcelona. The shuttle only accomodates six and has an awkward schedule. Public transportation to the centre is complicated.",3,2008,07,19
28,Heaven in the hills,"It was my 60th birthday and my dear wife wanted to treat me to a romantic long weekend to Barcelona. We chose La Gran Florida as our base and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made a great choice. Our welcome at the hotel was absolutely superb, check in efficient and friendly and service impeccable. Our room was stunning with views stretching miles. I could go on and on but both my wife and I agreed that this was the best hotel we had ever stayed at. In fact we loved it so much we didn't venture into Barcelona at all preferring to enjoy the hotel instead. The stainless steel pool, the secluded sun decks and the position high on a hill overlooking the whole of Barcelona are good enough reasons alone worth checking in. However, the food is as spectacular as the setting. Most important of all every member of staff from the manager to the bell hop made us feel really special. I have seen reviews refering to the hotel as expensive but I would prefer to describe it as exceptional value for money when you receive this level of service and quality. We have vowed to return at the earliest opportunity. After many years in the travel industry I strongly urge you to experience this wonderful hotel.",5,2008,07,16
28,Disappointement!!!,"-It is FAR FROM BARCELONA!!!not what they say on their website-at least 20-25 min
-The Shuttle is not Flexible
-Taxi Cabs (most) will not give you a rid up to Hotel
-It is Noisy -There is a Park Next to it
-The Rooms are Retro Fit
-The Food/Beverage so Expensive!!! a Burger is around 35 Dollars! and one Tea (Room service) is around 15 Dollars!
-They Charged Extra on My Credit Card  without my approval!!! when my trip was prepaid, I had to deal with them for one month. No Apology, No Email Return

The good points:
-The Bathroom and Pool",1,2008,07,14
28,"Shoddy Service, Not Worth the price","I was expecting a great hotel, and really got spotty service for the rates of 500+ euros we paid. My wife and I stayed over 10 days in La Florida, and yes the location is beautiful and the rooms are OK, but service was bad to terrible specially in the restaurant and in the room. 

We had a huge leak in our junior suite (room 502), we reported this two days in a row, and nothing happenend. We did not even get an apology. 

Turn down service was on and off, sometimes they closed the drapes and left water, and sometimes they forgot. our complementary arrival 'gift' if you can call it, was a bottle of water and the card didn't even have my name.

Finally, the restaurant service was poor and quite slow. The second morning, after paying 56 euros for a continental breakfast, we ordered some poached eggs. After 45 minutes we asked our waiter for the eggs again, and she literally said its not my problem, its the kitchen. My wife that worked at the Four Seasons for 5 years tells me that this would have been a suspension or firing of the waitperson. We did get our eggs after 1 hour. 

Finally, their shuttle service only fits 6 people, they have 70 rooms, so you will really not get to downtown barcelona, so its 15 euros each way, to get to downtown. You can't walk it. So add this to your costs. Its not the cost, but just the nuisance to call a cab every day, and wait another 15 minutes. 

So, you are better off staying at Hotel Arts, or the Majestic these are truly great and professional hotels.

The only highlight was a Brazilean lady in the concierge/reception staff, she did a great job for us in some difficult restaurant reservations. 

Don't pay 500´Euros if you want only the view, you can go to the La Florida bar in the afternoon, have a great time, and pay 100 euros, and stay in a better hotel. 

Regards,

Erik Seiersen",2,2008,07,08
28,Wonderful Experience,"I used Trip Advisor to learn about this hotel so I wanted to give-back to the Trip Advisor community.  I booked this hotel as a special graduation gift for me and my 18-year-old niece.  We were also joined by my friend.  The three of us stayed in the charming roof terrace suite, featuring a private sun deck, views of the mountains and sea, and a wonderful bathroom.  The rate was $966 Euros per night, per the rates quoted on the site.

Things that delighted us:

The room was wonderful and exactly as described on the website--large, modern, beautiful.  Breathtaking views from the deck.  Best ammenities ever--robes, slippers, chocolates, stereo system, L'Occitaine bath products.  Free access to WIFI.

We liked the semi-remote location on the hill overlooking the city.  We had just spent a week in the center of Madrid and it was nice to have several days up in the hills.

The staff was gracious, helpful and goodlooking.  The young staff was very international with--we spoke to staffers from Spain, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, the United States, and Portugal.  Communication was very easy.

The shuttle to-and-from the city from the hotel was very convenient.  It gave us the freedom we wanted and security that we could get back without hassle.

The buffet breakfast was terrific, with a wide variety of fruits, breads, meats, fish, and sweets.  Great service in a nice sunny atmosphere.

Nice spa treatments--book ahead of time by at least a day if you can so that the hotel may get the right type of spa specialist for  you.

The pool area bar was wonderful during the day and evening.  We sunned, swam, rested, drank and ate there several hours per day.  In some ways we wasted the sun-deck in our room.  We liked the atmosphere of the pool bar.

Things that could have been better:

The hotel is very intimate, which means you are really aware of the other people around you. During our stay there were two groups of business people staying at the hotel--a young group of Brits and a group of French representatives from the Dodge motor company.  Whenever these groups came to breakfast or the pool bar their phones were ringing or they were powering up computers.  This was slightly annoying because they changed the entire atmosphere of the restaurant or bar--seeing them made me think of work, when I was trying to relax on my vacation and not deal with phones and computers.  On the day we were leaving, the hotel announced that they were closing the the pool bar area that night for a special event for the Dodge people.  I'm glad we were leaving because that would have been annoying.  There is no other place to hang out if the pool area is closed.  I recommend that if you are looking for a quiet time here, check first to make sure no groups are staying in the hotel that week.

Overall, this was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning in the future.",5,2008,06,20
28,The Most Amazing Hotel We Have Ever Stayed In,"I booked the hotel through Lastminute for my boyfriends birthday but checked the reviews first on Tripadvisor. Lastminute have some great deals for this hotel which make this more affordable. The hotel is stunning so we felt really lucky to have got such a good deal as the prices normally are very high. 

Room - beautifully decorated, with the biggest bed ever and crisp, expensive bedlinen. We were also lucky to have a room with views of Barcelona.

The Bar - I just had to mention this as we still talk about the Vodka Lemonades that we had there which were the nicest we had ever had and we have had a few!! 

The downside is that you are a cab drive into the city but I prefer that rather than having a noisy hotel in the centre.

I would recommend everyone to stay at this hotel once in your lifetime.",5,2008,05,18
28,A Beautiful Retreat,"My wife and I enjoyed the first night of our honeymoon at this wonderful hotel in the hills above Barcelona.  Staff was wonderful.  Public areas of the hotel are beautifully done and the hilltop setting offers spectacular views of the city and the med.

We upgraded to a ""Terrace Room"" with hopes the terrace offered a nice place to enjoy the view.  It doesnt.  The terrace rooms have no view and are basically patios with fences.  Very dissapointing as I think we would have had better views in a less costly room.  That said, the bathroom and rainshower were great.

Restauraunt was good, not great.  Service was very good throughout dinner but problem with a few ants in a dessert was handled poorly by management who rather than simply apologizing and offering a drink offered an excuse.  We had a great time and were not banking on a freebie, but were a bit put off by the excuse.

Grounds and pool are beautiful.  Church atop hill is beautiful and it is worth a climb to the top to see the views.",4,2008,05,13
28,What a setting!,"The setting is dramatic and as beautiful as at any hotel i've stayed at.  The hotel is also lovely, though possibly trying a bit too hard on the boutique stakes (the pool, for instance, whilst it looks amazing and has a real wow factor, it feels its more like something to look at rather than something you would want to have a cool refreshing swim in).

The terrace is also amazing and generally the hotel oozes quality.  Staff extremely good.  Didn't have any meals other than breakfast here, but breakfast was decidedly average i thought.

Would i come here again?  Yes definitely, on a romantic long weekend.",4,2008,04,25
28,The relentless pursuit of excellence - or otherwise,"If five stars are to mean anything, it would surely be the relentless pursuit of excellence and a passion for detail. La Florida scores highly in most areas, and performs woefully in others.

Let's do the easy bits: stunning location; breathtaking views; gorgeous terrace; warm and attentive restaurant and bar staff; and a truly amazing terrace with our suite.

So why fall down on basics like concierge service, room-keeping standards and security?

No surprises: I do not consider myself lucky to be the first person in the concierge's five years to have had his room broken in to* and cash stolen.  His indifference and the lack of any apology, any explanation or any help marked him out as unfit to do his job and the hotel as well below par.

Which brings us to an immutable truth about quality service: it's a cultural thing within a hotel.  

Either the bosses at the very top share a passionate belief in customer care and transmit that daily to their staff through their every action, or they don't. And at La Florida, customer care is just another box to tick, not part of its philosophy.  

For a hotel with such potential, that is a great shame.

* by the way, there was no sign of a break-in to my room and no explanation as to who else had keys.",2,2008,04,16
28,Excellent Hotel.  Excellent Staff.,"My wife and I spent our 10 year anniversary at La Gran Florida.  The staff goes above and beyond what I would ever expect here in the USA.  They are so incredibly polite and upbeat and they always make sure that you have everything that you need.  The view was spectacular at the top of Mt Tibabado, the hotel sits next to one of the most spectacular churches that you can see from anywhere in Barcelona.  I noticed that many of the other hotels are in very busy, touristy areas, but this one is all by itself.  There was an amusement park close by but it closed in the evening and never made much noise anyway.  The Gran Florida was extremely clean well taken care of.  The second to last night we were there, I lost my wallet.  In a mad frenzie to cancel all of my credit cards, the hotel staff helped me contact everyone in the states and even prepared a bubble bath with candles in our room to help relax us!!! I'm not one for bubble baths, but my wife considered it so thoughtful that a hotel staff would do such a thing.  Our best experience was the staff, they really care that the customer is completely satisfied. We would definitely return, no question.",5,2008,04,03
28,Most Luxurious Hotel in Barcelona,"What a phenomenal hotel!  The staff and rooms are beyond anything I've encountered in the US.  The hotel sits atop Mt. Tibidabo, a short cab ride from the main attractions of Barcelona but the view is to die for.  It's distance from the city gives it a very ultra-exclusive feel.  The rooms are state of the art modern and sleek.  The restaurant was fabulous.  Chef Dani is a genius with food, he created a beef dish that is baked in clay.  He monogramed ours with our anniversary date and it was served tableside.  You get to break the clay with an antique hammer and then the entree is transferred to a giridon and plated for you.  Nice touch.  Each course was lovelier than the last.  I went to El Bulli a few days later but think I enjoyed the meal at Hotel La Florida better.  The stainless steel pool is the only one of it's kind in any hotel and makes the pool area even that much swankier.  The staff to guest ratio is high and makes each guest feel as though they have their own staff and/or entourage.  What's truly sad is that every hotel after this one.....pales in comparison and you long for the luxury and bankroll to stay here all the time.",5,2008,01,29
28,Glorious Stunning Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel in December 2007 with my girlfriend (now fiance).  I chose this hotel particulary to propose in Barcelona and ensure the weekend was done in style and we were not dissappointed!    The room was immaculate, the hotel staff couldn't be more helpful.    Great swimming pool as well which merges into another pool on the terrace outside.   It is about 10 minutes drive in a taxi from Le Rambles in the centre of town so if you want something in the centre don't chose this hotel, saying that I would return again and stay at this outstanding hotel in Barcelona that had breath-taking views from our room.  
Not really a hotel to bring children (we left ours at home) but great for romantic breaks, lovers and for peace and tranquility.",5,2008,01,21
28,Breathtaking views,"Breathtaking views. I have stayed in many great hotels and this is the best I've ever stayed at. The staff are fantastic, the shuttle service is regular and punctual, and the facilities are next to phenomenol!!! Restaurant expensive but worthwhile with table views of the city. Relaxing environment also. Will be returning to the hotel.",5,2007,12,03
28,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel in August this year for a long weekend and thought it was lovely. The rooms where gorgeous, the staff were excellent and the views were breath taking. The only downside was the cost of the mini bar and meals/beverages in the hotel. 

It is fine to pay extra for a nice hotel, but the mini bar etc.. was very over priced more like day light robbery, so that was slightly disapointing. The spa treatments were also very over priced. 
But overall for a special break away i would highly recommend it. Be aware though that the hotel is around about £18-£25 taxi drive away from the centre of Barcelona each way. The hotel does have a free shuttle, but it gets full very quickly so book your place well in advance!",4,2007,11,26
28,Great View,"We stayed here for 3 nights in October.  We deliberately chose a hotel away from the city centre so that it would be quiet and we would get great views.  Well we did get great views and our terrace was superb for chilling out and watching the world.  However we did not get quiet.  Sadly the theme park next door, which we were well aware of and thoroughly enjoyed with our son, was a tad noisy.  At first the screams of enjoyment were amusing but a whole day of it did get tiresome.  Having said that it was only at the weekend and it did all stop at 8pm and didn't start till about midday.

The other issue we personally suffered with was a wedding being held in the hotel. The price we paid for having a superb view and terrace was that we were right above the wedding venue.  The thud from the music was bad enough ( and this went on till gone 3am) but also the noise from drunken guests who regularly wandered past our room to get to theirs.  I'm sure elsewhere in the hotel this was not a big problem but it was for us.  So be warned, as delightful as the few rooms are with their terraces, on a Saturday night it is probably better to be elsewhere in the hotel.

The other problem we suffered was the inability to get a table in the restaurant. To cut a long story short don't assume anything, book a table before you arrive.

Overall this hotel is lovely with stupendous views.  However it does not really merit a leading hotels of the world badge especially for the price paid.",2,2007,11,11
28,Too far from the centre,"4 of us stayed for 2 nights in October 2007. We had a very good deal from a travel website and paid £Sterling 112 per night including breakfast and an upgrade to de-luxe rooms. We all thought that was about the right price and would not have been happy to have paid much more. The staff were very pleasant, the bed was superb, the views were great, breakfast was full of good choices. The downside was the location. 20/25 minutes away from Barcelona centre and a hopeless shuttle bus that ran from 10am to 6 pm and only took a small number of people. Cabs cost around 40 euros return to the centre. My advice is, if you want to see Barcelona book a city centre hotel. Also, in the summer a large theme park/fairground attraction is right next door and that could be noisy.",4,2007,11,01
28,Nearly perfect!,"My wife and I stayed here for 7 nights in September- We choose the hotel because we really needed to kick back and chill out but we also wanted the option of hitting the city when we felt the urge for a bit of action! La Florida is a great hotel, no doubt about that but they do let their standards slip from time to time and I did witness levels of service that I would usually associate with 3 star hotels. The staff in the bar and restaurant were new and they were badly trained, in general the hotel seemed understaffed and I did witness other guests getting extremely frustrated with the speed of service at the pool bar. Luckily I did not experience this myself as I developed a rapour with the barmen from day one! The senior barman at the poor bar is a real professional and it was only on the nights he was off the place struggled!

No doubt the food and drink here is over priced and I would not recommend anyone who cares aboout paying €7 for a bottle of water or €20 for a sandwich going here. You are paying a serious premium for the pleasure of eating and drinking in what must be one of the coolest properties in Europe! We absolutely adored the property- it really is classy and there is a calm chilled out ambience to the place that is hard to imagine. We actually only ended up going out twice in the whole week as we were so relaxed we could not be bothered moving! 

The pool/spa area is great- very quiet. The thermal suite is poor however- they went for a black interior in the steam rooms and it is not ageing well- it looks dirty even though it is not. This black interior was in keeping wih the general design of the spa but I think the designers got this badly wrong! A more traditional marbel interior would look far better- I have been in dozens of steam rooms in spa's across the world and this one rates at the very bottom! That said everything else is excellent in the Spa, but unfortunately as in other depts. of the hotel they do on ocassion let the standards slip and thats a pity. 

We had a room with a tearrace on the first floor- great room, great bathroom and a superb deck with sunloungers [not that we used them as we could not drag ourselves away from the pool]

All and all a great experience!
We will be going back as soon as we can- we loved the hotel and I have no prob recommending it.",5,2007,10,04
28,Hotel with a view outside the city center,"I stayed at Hotel La Florida for one night on September 18th, 2007. As a Leaders Club member I made my reservation through Leading Hotels, the rate for a standard room was 246,10 Euro taxes and breakfast included.

There are many nice but also some negative aspects so that I rate this hotel in total with three stars (=neutral/average compared to other top class hotels).

But in detail: On the good side were

- a prompt doorman service, luggage transfer, personal check-in with a glass of champagne,
- guidance to the room with nice introduction to the hotel facilities and history,
- upgrade to room no. 501 with Barcelona view and a spacious bath with impressive shower stall, tub and separate toilet,
- personal welcome card in room (in my native language), a complimentary bottle of water, fruits and a welcome gift (""Zen candle stick""),
- very nice and clean spa with indoor-/outdoor pool,
- cozy atmosphere in the whole hotel and plenty of staff,
- restaurant L'Orangerie with good value for money (solid six course tasting menu for 64,20 Euro),
- turn down with additional bottles of complimentary water,
- free internet access and many copies of international papers in the lobby.

On the other hand there were some negative aspects:

- the hotel is located in the nowhere of Barcelona, a complimentary shuttle service runs a few times a day but all seats for all shuttles during my stay were already booked when I checked in (at about 3 pm - the maximum capacity are six seats per shuttle only!),
- one finally has to use taxis when going to downtown Barcelona what takes first about 15 minutes until a taxi arrives and furthermore costs about 30 to 40 Euro for a return trip to the city center in total (the taxi drivers bill the arrival as well so you start with an amount of 5 to 6 Euro),
- there was no clock in the room - not even in the TV or telephone display - and the staff wasn't able to organize any watch or alarm clock during my stay (I had this unusual experience one night before at Casa Fuster Hotel, they finally provided a clock but failed in other things),
- there was no shoehorn or any shoe cleaning item in the room and a shoe shine wasn't done overnight (although I placed my shoes outside the door at about 11pm),
- annoying minibar pricing: a Coke (0,2 l) costs 8,56 Euro (!) and you won't find any other shops or foodstores in the neighbourhood,
- there was no DVD player available, not even on request,
- there was plenty of young staff, very friendly but inefficient (e.g. no help with the clock, not even a response/ the headwaiter at L'Orangerie first showed a half board card which wasn't valid for me, came back with the regular card and after request with a tasting menu offer but didn't know what was included in the tasting menu/ the cutlery wasn't replaced as there were no towells replaced in the spa although there were up to four employees around...)

Anyhow a nice hotel but not a ""leader"" in the hotel business. When you accept the mentioned disadvantages and be prepared staying outside of Barcelona it might be okay.

28,One of the best hotels I've experienced!,"I've travelled the world and stayed in a fair few luxury 5* hotels along the way (as well as a lot of not so luxury hotels!).  After reading the reviews I expected La Florida to be a very nice 5* hotel, but it exceeded any expectation I could ever have had.  5* doesn't really hit the mark.  From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable.  We arrived late at 11.30pm, pulled up outside reception, and got greeted, with our car keys being taken away, and the car being whisked off to be parked.  We got seated in the little private reception area, and they opened a fresh bottle of Cava for us (this is normal for evening arrivals, no special occasion).  Check in was smooth, and we had a tour of the hotel before being presented with our 4th floor sea view room, which was on the corner of the building which meant we had 2 balconies facing different sides of the hotel.

This hotel is aimed at adults, who like to relax, and who like nice interiors.  The rooms are tastefully furnished, and there's a wide choice of rooms available.  The swimming pool is a beautiful stainless steel infinity pool which overlooks Barcelona.  Unlike a lot of 5* hotels where the bar music extends to a cheesy pianist, La Florida has a low key resident DJ in the bar on Friday & Saturday night (think this may only be in the summer), who played relaxing chilled out tunes all night, similar to chilled Hed Kandi.  

The dress code in the evening was whatever you wanted to wear.  I saw women in slinky long dresses, as well as women in shorts and flip flops.  You can either sit at the bar, or at the table seats overlooking the terrace and the lights of Barcelona, or laze around on the sofas (literally laze horizontal) . This hotel felt like a home from home, where anything goes, and you feel like you can really relax if you want to. The food was nice, but fairly expensive for Barcelona.  The service was slower than I'd normally expect, even for food that's cooked from scratch, but that's the only negative point that I would have with the hotel (and it's not a big negative, it just stood out from the rest of the hotel which was spot on).     

We chilled out in the steam rooms, which were very hot!  They have a seperate female/male spa section with a hot steam room each, and a dry hot (steam?) room with soothing lights and sounds.  You can also reach an inter-connecting shared male/female steam room from both the male and female facilities.  The spa has lots of showers and  L'occitaine products to shower and moisturise (these are also the standard products in the bathrooms of the hotel) .  This is perfect if you check out of the hotel at 12.00 and your flight doesn't go until the evening as you still get full use of the hotel facilities. 

The gym is small, but fairly well equipped, with the emphasis being on the treadmills (in my experience, the most used equipment in a hotel gym).  There are bowls of apples in the gym, reception, and other public areas, so plenty of healthy snacks to munch on throughout the day.  They also place caraffes of water with fresh mint or fresh lemon in the public areas so you can help yourself to drinks whenever you want. 

All in all, there was nothing that we wanted for at this hotel.  It is a superior 5* hotel, with facilities that made you feel that you were truly being looked after without the stuffiness of a lot of 5* hotels.  We were lucky to pick up a sea view suite at 180 euro a night on a special offer.  From looking around, the normal price is a lot more.  Whatever the price, this place is worth splashing out on.   From day one I was completely relaxed. That's worth more than money in my book. It's worth it, go enjoy yourself, and relax and have some well earned fun.

28,Great hotel,"Great hotel away from city approx 15 euros in a taxi-design suites very special if a little expensive-great staff-amusing to have the small amusement park up the hill didn't detract from the setting
Little short on loungers on terrace full by 10 am -terrace menu limiting main restaurant has to be pre booked-overall throughly recommend
",5,2007,09,12
28,"Superb accommodation, but overpriced","This hotel has so much to offer; beautiful, large, well designed rooms, breathtaking views of Barcelona, the stunning Zen zone where you can enjoy the stainless steel pool or relax on the terrace. The staff on our trip were courteous, professional and helpful. The location of the hotel is problematic and I think they should consider doing more to help guests get in and out of the city. More flexible shuttle trips and, in particular, later shuttle trips to return guest from the city after midnigt would certainly ease the problem. Otherwise it will cost 15 - 20 euros to travel from the city centre. We also found that most of the taxi drivers did not know  where the hotel was located (we may have been unlucky) and on our last evening the taxi driver, who appeared drunk, took us on some bizarre route which cost us 25 euros! We did discover that the metro line 7 can take you to Avenue Tibidabo which is at the foot of the mountain and cost us about 10 euros from there to the hotel. However the metro closes at 12pm during the week.

While we were happy with the cost of the rooms, the cost of food and drink in the hotel is exhorbitant. I expected to pay a premium for 5*, but the charges are really excessive. The worst example was breakfast which we only had on one day and cost us 68 euros. for this princely sum we were supplied with a meagre selection of very poor quality pastries, some cereal and poorly prepared eggs benendict which was also cold! I don't mind paying more for 5* luxury, but I at least expect to get what I paid for.

You will enjoy La Florida - we certainly did, but unless you are happy to fork out 200 euros for a meal (2 people), 56 euros for a basic breakfast (again for 2 people) eat in the city which is relatively inexpensive. Make good use of the shuttle service into the city as this can half your taxi bill and if you are not returning after midnight take the metro to Avenue Tibidabo for a less expensive taxi journey to the hotel.

28,Wonderful Retreat!,"Beautiful hotel on top of the hill, overlooking the city of Barcelona and the sea. Hotel shuttle bus to town, nice breakfast on the terrace overlooking the sea, extremely wonderful dinner place, not exactly inexpensive but sooo delicious! Great service. Nice pool area. We even walked from the hotel downtown (2 hours thru the beautiful and cool woods) every day and took the shutlle back uphill. The only thing on Saturdays: due to the Tibidabo amusement park nearby it might get a bit loud until well after midnight but who's there to go to bed early anyway! It's not so noisy during the week (only until 9pm or so which is nice). Definitely one of our favorite hotels in the world, small and something special. Make sure to get a room with sea view, it's worth the price difference!

",5,2007,07,15
28,Marvelous boutique hotel,"After a long and bumpy  taxi ride from the airport to La Florida, steping into the hotel was like entering another world of quietness, beauty and cosy luxury. Check in takes place in a lounge like mini office with 2 desks.

 I was escorted to my room. As a leading hotels of the world's leaders club member i was upgraded to a corner room with city view. The whole bedroom size is fine, decorated with subtle luxury taste, high ceiling, bathroom rather big with fantastic shower and ""l'occitane"" products, flat screen framed tv. Lots of personal touch in the room like my favourite newspaper, cookies, fresh fruits, chocolate box and a gift (candle changing its colour when it's burning). Lots of bottles of water.

Dinner at ""l'orangerie"" restaurant was a great taste and food experience. It's overpriced for barcelona criterias and prices but in line with gastronomic restaurant prices all over europe. Exceptionnal chilean wine, straberry and mint sorbet. The veal flet and truffles sauce on a brioche slice was devine. One tip before you have dinner there, make sure you book a table by the window and make sure you actually get it as it might not be the case (table reservation handeling is the down side of that place).
Perfect slept. I had breakfast at the restaurant's terrace with a terrific view of barcelona. Well appointed buffet with hot/cold, sweet/salted options. After a lazy morning on my balcony, i had a late lunch still at the restaurant terrace. Full lunch menu at 35 euros.

I only stayed there 1 night and wish i'd stayed there few more days. Though some pieces of furnitures would need a make over (especially sofas and armchair in the public area) it was like being home in a hotel. Perfect retreat out of busy barcelona where you can spend the day, the hotel provides free shuttle downtown  to plaça catalunya (20mn drive). La Florida is on my top 3 hotels in the world.

28,Magnificent Urban Oasis,"Gran Hotel La Florida-
July 3,2007
Reviewer:Brooklyn NY
""Magnificant Urban Oasis""
.
My wife and I just returned from 5 days and nights in Barcelona. We had planned on staying the beginning of our trip at La  Florida and then stay more centrally at the Majestic in Eixample but loved La Florida so much that we cut short our stay at the Majestic and returned for our last two nights to La Florida.  Service was warm, attentive and personal. Check in was a delight as we sat at a table with our front desk person who made sure we had drinks as we went over the details ,.He then brought us to our room while the bellman brought our bags- very classy. In fact service was exemplary and most attentive throughout our stay.  The room at the start was huge on the second floor with floor to ceiling windows with a magnificant sweeping view of Barcelona. The bed was a super comfortable King size. The bathroom was similarly huge with double sinksand a separate bath and shower . The pool was spectacular , located both inside and outside and heated just right for a pleasant swim. There was a multi tiered seating area beneath the pool with all seats facing the panoramic view.(One word of caution-if you arrive at the pool too late most seats are already taken sort of like some of the Caribean resorts we have visited so plan ahead a bit to get a seat) Breakfast was delicious with tons of cheese, bread and meats and the setting most romantic outside overlooking Barcelona.  We generealy relaxed poolside for a couple of hours before heading into Barcelona by the free Hotel shuttle. The shuttle did tend to fill up so again if you can plan , you should make a reservation in advance. We usually just took a taxi back whenever we wanted to at around 15 Euros. We decided to return for the second portion of our trip because after exploring Barcelona for most of the day into the early evening we wanted to relax at our oasis. Barcelona is a great city but it is loud and crowded and we just wanted to escape at night . If we were only staying a couple of nights perhaps it would have been better to stay in the center of town , but with a more relaxing 5 days we enjoyed our relaxation time at La Florida and still had plenty of time to visit all the sights. When we returned our second room was a little smaller with more normal sized windows but we had a balcony which more than made up for the slightly smaller room-
In short La Florida was the perfect hideaway for a 5 day trip to Barcelona. It was the best of both worlds-a luxury resort hotel only about 20 minutes from all the sights.

28,Nicest hotel in 30 years of travel,"I have traveled extensively, and have stayed in many 5 star hotels.  This was by far the lovliest hotel of all my trips.  The view is spectacular (ask for ocean/city view), with beautiful decks and lush rooms.  The room service was somewhat slow, but we didn't care.  The pool here is extraordinary, the spa wonderful.  An added bonus for us was a cathedral and AMUSEMENT PARK within walking distance!    I HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

28,We loved it !,"We just returned from Barcelona 5 days ago. We had 4 nights at the Gran Hotel La Florida. We absolutely loved it. We had hesitated in staying there, because it is on Mt. Tibidabo, a little away from the main parts of the city. Once we arrived, we were thrilled we had chosen this hotel. It was actually a pleasure being away from the city. Barcelona is teeming with people. La Ramblas is kind of seedy. We were disappointed in that area. Lots of guys at night were drunk or on drugs. We went once and then stayed away.
Back to the hotel. They were extremely accommodating in getting us transportation anytime into Barcelona. They run a free shuttle throughout the day. We would usually take the shuttle into Barcelona, and then take a taxi home at night. It was easy to get a taxi either way, and cost about 15 Euros. 
The hotel is physically beautiful. I had read other reviews about the pool area, and it is magnificent. The outside pool area is terraced overlooking the city (the inside pool flows into the outside pool). Breakfast can be outside on the terrace which I highly recommend.  The rooms were beautiful. The bathrooms were all beige marble, elegant and spacious. There was a separate shower and tub. The views from all the rooms are gorgeous. All rooms have flat screen TV's (not that we watched very much). 
The hotel is smaller and more intimate, yet large enough that we felt anonymous when we wanted to be. The staff were extremely helpful. We loved it and would stay again anytime. You would not make a mistake by staying here, even if it is a 15 - 25 min. drive into Barcelona. The drive was nothing and didn't detract in any way from our time in Barcelona. It was a plus. I only wish someone had saved me from agonizing over the decision to stay there vs. in Barcelona. We are very happy we chose this hotel!

28,Great service...NOTTT!,"400 euros a night is fine if you get good service but from the moment
we parked our hire car at the front door and lugged our bags in, looking right, then left for reception I had a bad vibe.

OK, so what there wasn't a porter to help..things would get better?

At reception we had this terribly snooty type that looked down her nose and considered we may be just worthy enough to stay in her fine establishment. Not one smile...not one

Right, I pondered, let's just see what the room was like.

Got there, noticed chips on the front door of the mini bar, smallish room but thought what the hell... been travelling for ages, I'm not going to move now.

Then we were given the free shuttlebus times to get into Barcelona city centre and noticed that the last bus back to the hotel wasn't 2am, or even midnight but 7.45 pm! So no chance of dinner in Barcelona unless you want an expensive taxi ride back late (according
to Time Out that would be if you were lucky enough to get a taxi). I complained and got upgraded to a super uber deluxe suite. I said to the General Manager that I just wanted to leave but she informed me we could but would be charged the full room rate, despite the hotel being half full.

The hotel is looking a wee bit tired as well-managed to escape after one night and landed up in Hotel Majestic... much better thank you.",2,2007,06,14
28,Do not go alone .,"I have been there on a business trip.
I will begin with the negatives.
1.I was alone.
2. I idid not have car.
The place is fantastic, with incredible views of Barcelona, and its the place for a romantic get out.It's not the place for business.This implies that is far from down town, half an hour with car.If you have a car, its ideal. Please take into notice, that there is nothing(restaurant, mini market), lets say at least 10 km from the hotel.
The food is around 70 euro  per person, which is somehow expensive. 
Wrapping up, do not go there if you are going with friends to chill out in Barcelona.
However, if you want to make your partner a perfect getaway, go.You owe it to yourself .
",5,2007,04,23
28,The perfect retreat,"The best thing since sliced bread.  Seriously!

Let me put it to you this way... it is the ONLY hotel that overlooks all of Barcelona.  It is romantic and classy, yet modern- has breathtaking views, and they have thought of everything so that you don't have to.  

Sure it is a trek from city center, costing roughly €14 for a one way trip... however, if you have the money to spend, and you are looking for something that will take your breath away, then I assure you, La Florida IS the place to be.

The hotel itself is beyond amazing.  It is 5 stars- and yet it doesn't have that big, overwhelming feel of a five-star hotel.  Second, it is unbelievably classy in every sense of the word.  Whoever came up with this design - the concept of having a hotel such as this on the top of a mountain overlooking all of Barcelona, and whoever decorated the place, definitely deserve an award.  

The architecture is top-knotch.  Make sure that you reserve a room with a sea view because then you can see all of Barcelona.  Also try to get a room with a terrace.  Believe me, you WON'T be disappointed.  While everyone else is riding the blue tram to get to this height and experience this view for a few hours- you will have it all day and all night long.

The indoor/outdoor pool is the kind that kids dream of... you can start off inside, in a HUGE relaxing granite sanctuary and then swim under a glass wall and boom, you are outside!  The other great thing is this pool is heated so you can use it in the summer or the winter.  And the best thing?  It is open until midnight.  Some of the best moments I had at this hotel were when I went swimming at 11pm in the freezing cold.  I swam outside under the stars and looked over the edge of the pool to see the lights of Barcelona below while the steam rose up and reminded me that it was only 42° outside!  

Even if you do get cold (which you will if you stay in the outdoor area long enough), there is a very, very warm hot tub waiting for you indoors on the other side of the pool.  
In the summer there is also an indoor/outdoor pool bar that sells refreshments and sunscreens.  
Aside from the pool, you also have a state-of-the-art gym with a television and lots of cardio machines... also saunas, and a spa where you can have body treatments, facials, nails and hair done.  

The outdoor pool area also has an enormous sun deck, so you shouldn't have a problem finding a lounge chair for sunbathng. 

The restaurant, L'Orangerie is also to die for-- just make sure you make reservations as soon as possible (I would recommend when you make the reservation to the hotel).  Of course, they do eat later here in Spain so if you are looking for an 8:00 dinner- you might be the only ones eating- so it shouldn't be a problem. 

Another added amenity, that we didn't even know about until we arrived, is that the Tibidabo amusement park is right next door to the hotel.  Don't worry, this isn't a Six Flags or a Disney World enormous amusement park... rather a classy and discreet park that was built on the side of Tibidabo mountain back in the early 1900's.  Most of the rides are gentle and not scary at all.  They are (what avid amusement park goers would say), rides for ""beginners"".  It is a great place for young kids... or really for anyone just looking to experience some relaxed fun on ""fair-type"" rides. 
However, I will say that because this park was built on the side of a mountain, there is an added feel of excitement on some of the rides... after all, you feel like you are at the height of an airplane when you can't see the ground beneath you!  

Make sure that you pay the actual entrance fee (€22)-- don't just buy the tickets (€11)... the tickets only allow you to use the rides right at the entrance, on the first level, so you will be missing more than 3/4 of the park (the park works its way DOWN the mountain on 6 different levels).  

In the end, Gran Hotel La Florida is the perfect escape.  To be honest, I wouldn't recommend the hotel for anyone who is only in Barcelona for a couple of days and who want to see as much as they can... but if you are there for 5 or more days, I would suggest staying in city center for the first three days (Omm or Hotel Majestic) and getting your sight-seeing out of the way (the tour buses are a great way to get a quick overview)... then move to La Florida to get in your relaxation.
  
In the end, it will probably be the best part of your trip!

28,Beautiful location,"This is a beautifully desined boutique hotel on top of a hill overlooking Barcellona. The view is absolutely breathtaking. The staff at the hotel were very polite and tried to accomodate us the best they could. However,  the service industry in Spain generally leaves something to be desired!
The rooms were spatious and elegantly designed. The terrace with the bar and the swiming pool are magnificent. Going to Barcellona proper is a trip in itself and the shuttle service is really not frequent enough so if you want to experience Barcellona in its fullest, this hetel is probably not ideal but if your looking for a romantic stay in a secluded, elegant hotel you cant go wrong with this hotel.
",4,2007,02,02
28,Nice for the swimming pool,"Gran Hotel La Florida is a small nice hotel. BUT if you want to compare with other Barcelona hotels like Casa Fuster, i would say you have to make a choice between a nice hot water swimming pool and spartiate room ( Gran Hotel La Florida ) and a very nice room, very clean and well decorated, with lots of bath cream, soaps but ridiculous small pool ( Casa Fuster ).
Another detail i did not like at La Florida was the Occitane bath products: in a five star hotel, you can not offer those products! Restaurant, room service was nice at La Florida. At Casa Fuster, room service was too long as they forget my first order.
Next time i am in Barcelona, i will probably choose again Casa Fuster.
",4,2006,12,22
28,a great hotel with a great view,"A superb hotel because of its location on Tibidabo hill with a panoramic view of Barcelona, 
because it is quiet away from the noise of the bustling city and surrounded by green terraces, 
because of its genial staff, particularly the concierges
and because of its great indoor pool and spa area. 
L'occitane bathroom amenities are provided. Breakfast offers a rich choice of salmon, cold meets and cheese but the choice of bread and pastries is limited (for example wheat bread is not available).
The hotel can be reached by public transport, from the plaza Catalunya, you take the FGC lines S1 or S2, every 10', to the Peu Funicular, then the funicular uphill and the ""bus del barri"" 111, every 30', leaving from the funicular station at quarter after and before the hour. Five minutes later, you arrive at the hotel.
An alternative is the complementary hotel shuttle, about 7 times a day to the intersection of the Diagonal and the Gracia, but reservation is necessary.
Finally, a taxi costs about € 14.
The low ranking in the popularity index seems to be biased downwards due to a negative but irrelevant comment.

28,Fantasy Palace,"No question but this is the smartest hotel I came across in Barcelona. It is your private luxury palace and the ultimate in beauty, light, and personal service. The outrageous prices are fully acceptable for what you get. The pool/ spa is top class. The views are amazing, and from all the rooms.
BUT and there is one: it is an hour's drive from the city into the mountains. Cab drivers need to be told to take the road to Tibidabo (where the funfair is) or they can spend hours driving in circles. The cabs are cheap enough and it is pleasant and cool when you get there, and such a relief to get out of the city itself. The resort is exclusive and inhabited by the seriously chic and wealthy. If you like that kind of thing or are on honeymoon...
",5,2006,12,05
28,How much for a gin and tonic?!?!,"This was my third trip to Barcelona, (first on my hen weekend, the second at Valentines) and I thought this hotel would be nice. My first mistake was to book a hotel so far away from the centre (silly me) and the second was to book a place so hugely over priced! I had a lovely room with a nice view of the city, a beautiful bathroom and very nice toiletries. A huge plasma TV which seemed to want to fall off the wall! The whole place was lovely, but too far away. We used the free shuttle bus to get into town, but it finished too early for it to be of use to us in the evening. All in all, we spent at least €40 per day in taxis including the free shuttle service. At the weekend, it was near impossible to get a seat at the times we wanted, and the return journeys were always full, so book ahead if you want to secure a seat.

In the evening we had drinks in the bar, the service was better than I had read much to my relief BUT the prices were frightening! On the first night we ate at the restaurant, the starters were lovely, but the mains was too fussy and too many flavours – the meal costs us over €280 for 2 people, no desserts, but 2 expensive riojas (€125). Needless to say, we didn’t eat there again as it was not worth the money.

This hotel is suited to couples who want to get away as the whole place is stunning, with views from the pool and bar – which incidentally is closed after Sept, so we were very disappointed. The rooms are beautiful and well kitted out with very high ceilings. I loved the place, baulked at the prices and got criticised by my husband for the amount of money and distance we had to go to get decent tapas and some night life! For those that have had enough of the touristy Barcelona (does that happen?) and are not shocked at paying €15 for a gin and tonic,  I think they will enjoy this place.

28,Great View Great Staff Great Food,"This hotel is in a great location. Stayed for a long weekend and never left the property. Having booked a special package i was amazed at how well it all worked. The check in was smooth and efficent, the Spa manager joined us in reception to work out when we wanted the treatments that were part of our package. We were shown to our room and the staff member made sure we were happy with the room and the facilities. 

We went straight down to the pool which has great views and great areas to lounge about. There were plenty of staff to bring drinks. The only delay seemed to be with food which did take a reasonably long time to arrive but was great when it did.

Dinner in the resturant was excellent and not overly priced for the quality. The wine list is long and varied.

One of the highlights apart from a massage from Tommy was the Sunday brunch. Huge selection and free Cava. Seemed to be plenty of locals enjoying the views and the food.

Some people have commented on a lack of language skills amongst the staff. We certainly didn't find this to be the case. Would we go back. yes.

expensive but worth it.

28,Looking for 4/5 star? Skip this hotel.,"Stayed recently in La Florida with my wife for a week. 

The hotel has an exceptional view and very nice premises including some spa utilities..but there is a problem: service is really really substandard.

Only one janitor and the Italian-born lobby boy were up to their tasks and responsibilities. The rest was a disaster. 

The excellent food of the very pricey hotel’s restaurant, L’Orangerie (quick dinner; 250 euros for 2), was totally ruined by very irritating service. 

Unfortunately I noticed too late that the issue of service had been posted here in previous reviews, even several times.

My advice: Not worth spending the money on the view and suffering a very bad service day in day out.

28,"Amazing view over Barcelona, spectacular swimming pool","The hotel view  over Barcelona is amazing. The pool is the best we had see so far. The room was nice, spacious, with a big bathroom. The hotel is a design hotel, recently refubish. Exactly what we like small, luxury, design hotel. However, the service can be improve, feels like it is under staffed.

28,Be Careful,"Everything about the hotel was wonderful except the fact that I was robbed, while I took a shower, by one of the maids. The service, spa facilities, room, food and of course the view where all excellent. I had nothing but glowing things to say about the hotel until the next to last night of my stay when I hopped in the shower and closed the door to the bathroom so that the maid could enter and fold down the covers of the bed and leave chocolates and water as they do each night. My husband went down to the business center to check his email and such. I left my backpack, with the wallet inside, by the bed. I heard the maid come in, then go out after a minute or so. I thought nothing of it, but when I got out the bed wasn't done nor were the refreshments left. I thought that it was really strange, but still wasn't completly alarmed until I noticed my backpack looked misplaced and things from my wallet scattered. I opened it and to my panick all of my cash($200) was taken!!! She didn't take my credit cards though but arranged them in a stack in one of the pockets. I know that my wallet was looted during my shower because just before that,  I took my debit card and lisence out to give to my husband to put in his wallet for the night out and my wallet was in it's normal state. I had no hard proof other than my honest word and of course she denied it. I had to try and forget about it, but it will have forever tarnished the memory of my trip. I was traumatized that it happened in a five star hotel while I was in my room. The manager said that the maids are used to people leaving valuable things out and never steal, well she picked something that she could get away with that he himself said the cops probably wouldn't come up there for just $200. The amount wasn't the issue it could have been $2. It's the fact that it happened as it did. It's a great hotel but be very careful!!!!

28,An Amazing Hotel for a Honeymoon!,"The hotel was magical and beautiful in more ways than one could describe.  The service was outstanding and the views breathtaking.  We ventured to the Tibidabo Mtn for our honeymoon and didn't wish to leave because the grandeur service and comfort provided to us by the Hotel.  The stainless steel indoor/outdoor infinity pool and spa was a design like no other.  Every corner of the hotel was a breathtaking surprise!  The hotel design was spectacular and perfectly done.  Plan to stay for a minimum of 2 days to truly enjoy all the wonderful amenities.  I look forward to returning soon.  As a reminder to Americans, there is no need to tip at the restaurants in Spain, it is already included.  Enjoy!

28,Awfull service,"This was my 6th stay at the Hotel and I can agree with other reviews that the service is getting worse and worse. 
First, even if it seems unbealivable, no one helped us with carrying our luggages to the room. Second, maiden came into the room while we were resting and the ""not disturb"" card was on the door. Thay awaked us from our ""siesta"". But what was more amazing is that they phoned us one minute later to ask us when would it be possible to clean our room (they've had 4 hours to do it since we were on the pool having lunch). For lunch, it took for ever for having a club sandwich, almost an hour. And finally, on our check out, no one say a simple ""thanks"" while paying the bill, they charged us breakfeast when it was suposeley included in the reservation and we had to wait for our taxi for almost 40 minutes. 
It is a shame because the hotel is great, rooms are very nice and location is unique. But the service is really pathetic.

28,Luxury & Design without 5-Star-Service,"I'm frequently travelling to Barcelone and it was my 5th stay in La Florida. The rooms - independend from the cathegory you choose - are all wonderful, very tasteful decorated and mostly offering a spectacular view over the skyline of Barcelone. Fantastic bathrooms and nice amenities. BUT: the service was perfect two years ago, and actually lot of stuff has changed (including the director) and the result is a really unadecuate service for a 5-star hotel. Seems they have reduced also the number of stuff. Still no limousine service and the shuttle service consists about only one shuttle and an inaceptable time-schedule.

The worst experience was the breakfast. What this hotel offers for 30,-€ ! has definitely the level of a 1-star hostal. The restaurant is nice, but nothing special - food arrives cold on the table...

My check-out was unbelievable - no concierge, no bellboy - i had to bring all my baggage by myself to my car, avoiding another 30-minutes waiting time...
",2,2006,04,09
28,Amazing views,"We stayed at this hotel for one night following a few nights staying in central Barcelona. The position of the hotel is amazing. We had requested a corner room and the hotel had provided this. We had amazing views from the two huge windows and balconies and an amazing view from the huge bathroom window. 

The room was nice, but not outstanding. The bathroom, however was definitely 5 star.

The reception service was great, but the maid service was not so good. They came in to turn down our beds whilst we were at dinner, but failed to replenish wet towels or used toiletries. We were also disturbed by them twice in the morning, depsite the fact that we were checking out.

The food and wine in the restuarant was great, but the service was not amazing. I was served fois gras, but it took them another 10 minutes to bring some toast. The main course arrived very quickly after the starter and then it took an hour after finishing our main for them to offer us dessert/coffee.

The pool and spa area is really lovely and it was great to swim in the warm outdoor pool looking at views of Barcelona.

We thought the shuttle service was great and it was a nice touch to be given a bottle of water on the shuttle.

Overall, it is a great hotel, mainly because of the location and views. I would definitely stay there again!
",4,2006,04,02
28,"good 4-star experience, not quite 5-star and by far not up to ""leading hotels""..","The hotel is beautifully located on top of a hill that overlooks the entire city. No question - as far as the location and the place in general is concerned - it's as good as it gets.
Judging from previous reviews I must conclude that they’ve had a steep learning curve. The service and staff was the most outstanding about this place from the very moment we came in. Warm welcome by multilingual receptionist, short checkin time, no queue etc…
The amenities of the hotel are reason enough to go there. Descriptions of the pool, lounge and restaurant can be found in previous reviews.
During our stay we noticed several details which I as a frequent traveller appreciate very much:

-when calling the reception you will always be addressed in the language used during checkin.
-weather forecast and chocolate will be on your bed when coming back from dinner. You will also find a bottle of still water on you bedside table.

Following items were disappointing:

-the shuttle service virtually not existing…. There is just few departures per day. This is especially a problem because out of 6 taxi drivers none knew the hotel. We had to show them on the map, one even refused to take us. The hotel does not offer any alternatives such as a limo service. And honestly – even if they’d charge a couple of bucks for it – it’s a five star hotel and the “free shuttle” argument doesn’t really count that much. Transportation must imperatively be provided – no matter whether for free or not.
-The room furniture is beautiful but partly in bad condition. (e.g. there should not be any cables hanging down from behind a flatscreen TV)
-Internet reservation did not work (well it worked, but they didn’t get it…)
-Entertainment system did not work as it should
-The food is ok but by far not what I am used to from hotels of an equivalent category
-Air conditioning didn’t cool below 23.8 degrees C

But after all this is a very good hotel. Obviously you may have high expectations at a place ranked as a 5-star leading small hotel of the world. 
It would be a top 4-star place but as a 5-star hotel – which it is – I am not quite satisfied.
And the restaurant – still being ok – does not have a Gault Millau rating, comments on the web are anything between bad and good. I my view it’s nothing special, but the location makes up a lot. I my consideration this hotel is top ten of Barcelona.",3,2006,02,07
28,"Majestic Facility, Miserable Service","My wife and I stayed for three nights at the Gran Hotel La Florida while on our honeymoon this past June.  The hotel itself is stunning - gorgeous, very well furnished, and perfectly positioned on Mt. Tibidabo; views of the countryside from one window, views of the downtown Barcelona from another.  Excellent pool and poolside facilities, well appointed restaurant.  Stunning views (I know I said it before, but it bears repeating).

BUT - it is as if the hotel owners refurbished the place to the highest standard, and then simply walked out the door and handed the keys over to their children.  The dining room was complete chaos from a staffing perspective.  This is particularly disappointing because the kitchen turns out some impressive dishes.  We were made to wait nearly two hours for the table we reserved (as guests of the hotel) and, when we finally complained (which is the last thing anyone wants to do when celebrating) the manager offered no apologies, only cava - which, while good, took 20 minutes for him to fetch.  Lunch service was similarly unimpressive - nearly two hours (yes, two) for a club sandwich; served with a heaping side of no acknowledgment, no apology, no excuse.  One notable exception in the confusion cafe the only one, in fact) was the sommelier - the man knows his wines, is in command of the bottles and glasses, and incredibly personable (his name may be David, but I cannot recall with certainty).

The ride down (or up) the mountain is another adventure - cabs wince at the notion of going up the mountain (many will order you out of their car, drive off before you get in or, failing that, wince, complain, and attempt to impose a surcharge for the trouble - do not pay it.)  The hotel's ""shuttle"" runs on a mid-day only schedule that is obviously more for the benefit of the reservation book at the hotel's restaurant than the guests who stay there (as noted, the restaurant has its own set of problems).

Yes, the views are impressive (truly) but be warned - you may tire of them while waiting for your table, cocktail, or lunch!

28,A Breathtaking Experiance,"The hotel perched a 15min drive from the outer skirts of Barcelona (20mins from Airport)on top of the Bilabado Mountain, next to the, so beautiful Catherdral ~ lit up spectaculary at night and so spiritual, over looking the whole city ~ The panaramic views from our 3rd floor duluxe double room were outstanding, inc a terrace (which during the warmer months would of been wonderful! A bit breezy and cold in the new year hols!)
The personel are very pleasant especiallly the bar/resturant staff and concierge. Relaxed atmosphere with the most romantic and relaxing Spa. The pool starts inside and ends out side overlooking the city.
The drive up and down by taxi into La Ramblas costs around 20euros, however there is a free hopper from the hotel at certain times. Very helpful! The best restuarants we ate in were in Gotic ( Agut ) and The 'Rec' area Little Italy and surrounding cocktail bars and resturants. The highest rated hotel in the centre Jazz hotel also looked nice. Overall our friend proposed to his girlfriend on the balcony of the catherdral and she accepted making this break one of the most relaxing and special weekends away ever! Truly a romantic hotel and location for relaxing or enjoying Barcelona.

28,Top Hotel,"This is one of the best hotels in the world. The rooms are modern / luxurious with magnificient bathrooms and good space. The terraces have spectacular views of the city. The nearby church and funfare are picturesque. The staff are helpful and discreet. Seasonal reductions make it very affordable too for a 5 star hotel. It's only a shame the room service menus are not more locally-inspired rather than ""international"". However if you want Miami-style Latin luxury in Europe this is the place. Highly recommended.

28,A Truly Spectacular Hotel!,"I was initially hesitant to book Gran Hotel Florida because it's so far away from the city.  It is admittedly not the best place to stay if you want to spend every day in the city, but is well worth a day or two taken out of a hectic tourist itinerary for a bit of relaxation.

The rooms are spectacular!  I cannot think of one thing I would change.  Our room had high ceilings and enormous floor-to-ceiling windows, and although it was one of the least expensive rooms, it was on a corner and had a panoramic view of the city.  Overly generous in terms of space, the room included a good sized hallway and two separate his and hers closets.  The decor was tasteful and elegant... creams and neutral tones without being the least bit generic (and I am on the picky side about that sort of thing).  The floors were hardwood.  The bed was comfy.  What's more, the room seemed as though it had just been given a fresh coat of paint and a thorough cleaning.  It was impeccable!

My favorite aspect was the bathroom.  To begin with, it was spotless.  It was a huge, luxurious space that I actually felt comfortable in.  Most hotel bathrooms, even pretty nice ones, can make you feel kind of icky.   The bathroom, completely done in travertine, offered a separate tub and shower, two sinks, tons of open shelving, a makeup mirror, towel warmer, bathrobes, plenty of plush towels, and an enclosed toilet area.  The shower was phenomenal.  It was so big you could have fit 5 people in there.  The dual showerhead and high water pressure were heaven.  And there was no drain to clog and leave you standing in a pool of water, because the shower uses a system that allows the water to run off the outside edges of the shower to a hidden drain below the floor.

Check-in/checkout was an intimate, personal experience.  The concierge was able to efficiently help us secure tickets to a show at the last-minute.

The only disappointment was the spa.  The treatment room for the massage had a clinical feel to it and the masseuse was sub-par.  Perhaps I'm used to American spas, which focus mostly on pampering guests.

Highly recommend this hotel!

28,Amazing service!  Amazing hotel!,"My husband and I just got back and we must say that we could not have been more pleased with the hotel and its service.  Unfortunately, the airline lost all of our luggage but the hotel staff bent over backwards to make our time in Barcelona easy and utterly enjoyable nonetheless.  In fact, our best meal in Barcelona was at the hotel's restaurant L'Orangerie. If you like small rooms and busy streets, stay in town.  If you are looking for romance and world-class relaxation, stay at Gran Hotel La Florida.",5,2005,09,07
28,"Spectacular hotel, disappointing service","My husband and I booked this hotel as the start of our honeymoon.  After getting quite lost trying to find the route to the hotel, we finally arrived at the hotel whose architecture and design are nothing short of breathtaking.

The lobby was inviting, decorated with comfortable sofas and bright flowers.  The gentleman who checked us in walked us around the hotel, showing us the restaurant, pool, and the sculpture pieces, it was nice to have an inviting welcome.  Our room was amazing - corner view of the mountains and the eastern side of the city with huge, two-story windows that went nearly from floor to ceiling - while lying in bed we could see the lights of the city twinkling at night.  I also would love to steal this hotel's decor for my own home - beautiful stone sinks and steam shower, beautiful bed linens, huge plasma tv....

The pool was great - very chic, and most definitely not a place for kids.  The panorama set before you is breathtaking and a great way to spend a relaxing afternoon.  I ordered drinks which were fairly reasonably priced (for a 5* hotel). Other reviews complained of noise from the hotel's surroundings - the amusement park was closed the week of our visit, so I can't say how loud that was, but I never noticed any noise from traffic coming up the mountain.

Our complaints came from the service.  I tried to get recommendations for restaurants IN Barcelona for my birthday dinner - we didn't want to eat at the overpriced hotel restaurant plus we wanted to see the city - but the concierge sent us to this awful tourist-overrun place called Shoko - don't go there.  After an awful dinner, we returned to the hotel and when I questioned the desk manager about checking out the next day, he told us we were booked for another night!  I told him there must be a misunderstanding, I had told the clerk upon arrival we were staying 2 nights instead of 3, but the desk person was adamant and told us we would be charged for another night if we decided to leave.  I was so infuriated!!! Even if it were a misunderstanding, he should have given me the benefit of the doubt!  Apparently customer service is a new concept here.  I left the lobby in tears, my birthday completely ruined, and went back to our room.  The desk manager came to our door 10 minutes later with a curt apology, he had found the notice of our earlier departure in another file.  I'm sorry, but that just didn't do it for me.  If he wouldn't have found that paper, we would have had to foot the bill for another 300 euros!!!!

We'd love to come back, but the staff needs some serious help.

28,Literally on top of the Hill!,"Almost by coincidence we booked a room at La Florida for just one night. We traveled with our two small girls (2 and 3) and got a wonderful, large room from which we could see all of Barcelona and the sea. Nice!
When we arrived in our room, there were wonderful, new wooden cots with very nice linens prepared for our daughters. Complete with Teddy bears, and nice, new mobiles with little furry animals over the cots. We like to stay in nice hotels, but this was the most inviting cots we have ever seen for our kids!
We (and the kids) loved the indoor/outdoor stainless steel pool and pool area. It's not the place where you let the kids loose though (no shallow pool or stuff like that), but we weren't planning to do that anyway.
Our experience with the staff was 100% pleasant, professional and friendly. We had drinks and food by the pool, dinner in our room and ate a very nice breakfast at the outdoor restaurant. The bath and showers in our room was an inspiration (as we plan to redo our bath at home...). Probably the nicest we've seen.
This is not the place you want to stay if you're planning to go to and from the hotel and the sights in Barcelona, it's too far away from the city center. (Rent a car if you're planning to travel to and from the hotel a lot!) But for us it was as a perfect, relaxing and luxurios stop during our two week-long stay in Barcelona and the Costa Brava, and we'd love to make it part of our plans on our next visit.

28,Awful Servie,"Really nice setting...but the service is so awful that its impossible to enjoy your stay.  Service in the restaurant and pool bar is awful.  The service in the spa is non-existent...and the overall reaction from management when we complained about the problems was complacent.

28,Hotel is Stunning But What Service?,"The hotel is a stunning property.  The rooms are expansive and comfortable.  The shower was absolutely amazing.  The views are spectacular and this is a good hotel if you are looking for some quiet.

The service, on the other hand, is non-existent.  Some of the staff try very hard while others totally ignore you.  We were not allowed to order a salad from the pool menu at the main restaurant, even though they had no salads on their menu and it was 90 degrees.  The table next to us at the restaurant was allowed to order from the pool menu.  It was very confusing.   Getting a simple sandwich at the pool had 1-2 hour wait.  

We could not get a table at the restauarant for two on Sat. night and were told we can sit and order from the pool menu (which is next to the restauarant).  So we opted for room service, which was not any better.  While we waited for over an hour for our food, they called us after 30-minutes if they can get the table?  Anyhow, I have lots more stories like this.  The hotel is gorgeous but it needs to have someone in charge who knows how to run a hotel.
",4,2005,07,19
28,"Overrated, Overpriced","For a hotel rated as 5* gran lux, I was expecting something truly outstanding from this hotel. Sadly, It let us down in a number of areas:

* The beautful pool area is situated next to a road and not far from an amusement park, so your relaxation is constantly interrupted by traffic noise and distant screaming.

* For a five star hotel, I noticed an astonishing number of maintenance oversights: cracked (and frankly dangerous) floor tiles, scratches and dirty marks on the walls of my room and various other problems.

* The hotel is in the middle of nowhere - there's nothing around except the amusement park. Don't be fooled by the ""minibus service"" - it runs only 4 times a day and not at all in the evening. So you'll be stuck using the outrageously expensive bar and restaurant. 7 Euros for a glass of draft beer. 15 for a perfectly ordinary club sandwich. The restaurant charges michelin star prices without quality to match. Call me cynical, but I suspect the minibus not running in the evening is a ploy to keep you captive to their overpriced facilities.

The view is awesome, but you'd be better off just taking the funicular railway up and taking a walk round than staying up here. Stick to the town instead - there's plenty of better hotels and you get to choose whatever bars and restaurants you want.
",2,2005,07,04
28,WOW!!  What a hotel!!,"What a gorgeous hotel!  It's very close to the amusement park at Mount Tibadabo - don't let that fool you though - this is not a hotel for kids.  Luxury doesn't describe it!  Very sleek and modern.  We spent an entire day relaxing by the stainless steel swimming pool.  The pool area is terraced so it's fairly private and affords an unbelievable view of the city all the way to the coast.  Despite the haze - we could see the cruise ships in port.

We didn't eat at the restaurant but the pool menu was great - we had some American sandwhiches on day 12 of a 14 trip.  It was marvelous!!  The staff was very nice - there was one gentleman at the concierge who seemed a bit haughty.  We were headed to Montserrat and he was really pushing the tour - which didn't meet our timing requirements.  We ended up doing the train on our own and are so glad we did.  It was marvelous! 

The hotel is a dream and a perfect, relaxing way to end a hectic vacation!  Enjoy!!

28,Amazing views of Barcelona,"I stayed all-to-briefly at La Florida for business in June 2005.  The views of Barcelona are spectacular.  The hotel staff is extremely attentive, and the hotel itself is elegant.

The lobby is set with red candles and trendly smooth jazz.  During check-in, one is greeted with a welcome drink and a comfortable chair to sit.  My colleague and I had requested deluxe rooms, and we were pleased to be upgraded to Jr. suites upon checkin!  My room had a wrap-around balcony and a wonderful view of the city. 

I wish I had time to enjoy the spa.  It looked very nice.

Breakfast buffet was tasty, offering a nice variety of foods.  Eggs, sausage, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, meats, cheese, and more.

28,Heaven in the Hills,"After missing a train from Madrid and driving the five hours to Barcelona with a child, we were beat.  We also got terribly lost looking for the hotel, as it sits atop a mountain, and the hour was getting late.  Which makes finding this hotel all the better.  What a treat.  We got to our room, and breathed a collective sigh .  The bathroom was beautiful and the shower could've fit 6.   We were scheduled for three days and ended up canceling our other reservation and extended our stay for  7 nights.  If you want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle this hotel isn't for you.  If you like the idea of a wonderful respite and choosing when you want to go into the city this is for you.

The staff is 5 stars, from housekeeping to the bar to pool service to the front house.  We had a room with a large deck area, totally private which was wonderful.  We could order in and take it outside and have a lovely dinner alfresco in our fluffy robes.  The pool is amazing, our son was in heaven with the outside/inside pool option.  There was only one other family there, but it wasn't like the kids were doing cannon balls.  They were all very behaved.    I loved the tierred deck , the view, the spa facilities ( sauna etc..was wonderful after all the travel) .  It's a mellow and relaxed vibe, and we felt totally refreshed and ready for our next leg of travel.  Our last stay was the the Montage in Laguana Beach and the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point and this was better.  Highly recommend, hope to be back soon!

28,Great place ...,"It would be unfair not to give this hotel an ""excellent"" rating due to the history and beauty of the place. It is stunning with amazing views over Barcelona etc. The hotel is only about 4km from the city centre and it will cost you around 15-20 Euros by Taxi each way (this varies a bit depending on the taxi driving and whether he decides to take for a roundtrip!) - although there is a free shuttle service at 12 noon & 5pm each day (there may be one later also? ). The rooms and facilities are excellent and the stainless steel pool is the highlight. Staff were friendly and helpful. The thing to watch for is the food - we were disappointed by it - especially the ""soup of the day"". I could have made a better soup with my eyes shut. I think they had boiled the kettle and put an OXO cube in and that was it. ;-) Prices are quite high also. For 2 people, expect to pay 50 Euros at breakfast and around 150 to 250 Euros for an evening meal (although the sky is the limit if you want the best wines/champagne). If you don't want to pay these prices, then your only a short way from the city where you can find just about everything. Overall, you can't fault the hotel, as it really is stunning. Well worth a visit.

28,great place to relax,"We have just returned from a mid week break. We had a deluxe room with sea-view. The view is absolutely stunning if you get a corner room with 180 degrees of the cityscape. These views facing east get the morning sun. If you like sitting in the evening sun on your balcony then opt for the cheaper mountain view rooms. This is particularly pertinent as there didn't appear to be any public veranda getting the evening sun. the staff were extremely helpful and not at all snooty even though this is a top of the range hotel. the best thing has got to be the stainless steel pool with water outside maintained at 35 degrees. The only downside was that the cold water in the bathroom taps was never cold. Is this to get you to drink the overpriced water in the mini-bar? I would definitely return.

28,"Almost, but not quite 5 stars!","This review would have started with 5 stars had it not been for the restaurant. 

We were looking for luxury and pampering after two days of hustle & bustle in the centre of the city.

We found it – the Gran Hotel La Florida, it is fantastic, situated way above the city at the top of Mount Tibidabo. The hotel has the most wonderful views of the city and the surrounding mountains. 

We had one of the best deluxe rooms in the hotel 311 – two balconies both with amazing views. The room had the biggest bed, Plasma screen and every conceivable luxury you can imagine.

The service was excellent throughout the hotel, cava and chocolate dipped strawberries delivered to the room, a bottle of water by each side of the bed every night, all this PLUS the weather report for the following day! 

The pool area was like a Hollywood nightclub complete with projected TV art, although the service at the pool bar was a little inconsistent. 

This hotel really is the best we stayed at – the only let down was the restaurant, the food did not live up to the descriptions on the menu – David Stein says that his group of hotels have “meals that are exquisite, but not pretentious” – the food at L’Orangerie restaurant in the hotel was extremely pretentious. However the lobby and room service food are excellent although the Patatas Bravas portions could have been a little more generous!

Overall this hotel is amazing; the views make it extra special.

28,Fantastic Hotel,"It was our first visit to this hotel.  It was fantastic - upon arrival, a member of staff showed us around the hotel and the spa facilities.  By the time we finished our tour, our bags were already in our room - the lady proceeded to show us our room and wow! it was a breath taking view.  As it was a valentines week-end there were many deals you could go for, however we opted for a deluxe room with a city view and it was worth it.  The spa area was brilliant, the pool was great - the staff were great.  Clean and to a very good standard.  The food was out of this world.  For a week-end to pamper yourself great... it is a bit further out of the city, but a taxi ride which took no more then 10 mins into the heart of the city.  My advise - if you are going to visit the attractions, hop onto a tour bus, as they stop at the best places and you get discounts into the various attactions.  All in all a fab Hotel!

28,"Great Hotel, but a few drawbacks","I booked this hotel through last minute.com (after consulting this site) and got a great price for Valentine's weekend. Upon our arrival we were informed that we'd been upgraded to the Japanese Suite, 1 of 8 designer suites with private facilities.
The room and garden were truly amazing and made for a fantastic weekend. Sadly due to the location in the hotel of the room it didn't actually provide a view, except of the inside of the pool area and the carpark out front. But hey we wanted to visit the city and the view from the terrace made up for it. The price of drinks however was another matter, 13 Euros for 2 glasses of orange juice on our arrival put us off using the bar or the restaurant.
Sadly the shuttle bus was out of service for the entire weekend, odd that it was back in service first thing Monday morning, and so every foray down the mountain had to be made by taxi. We went to the same destination 3 times by 3 different routes and 3 different charges. 1 guy even had the front to try to old ""double back"" routine on us taking us about a kilometre out of our way to try to bump the fare. I let him know he'd been rumbled as most taxi drivers speak English even if they don't let on. On average expect to pay between 15 - 18 Euros from/to Placa Catalyuna.
As stated we avoided the bar etc due to the high prices and took our own drink into the room. We would have appreciated tea & coffee making facilites especially in the mornings, thank God for Starbucks. You would think that in a suite that has a listed rate of 1500 Euros per night you'd at least get a kettle.
The pool area was great, it's made of stainless steel and has no deep end. The view from the pool over the city is amazing, especially as you dont have to get out of the water to see it. The pool door was closed but we, as others, ducked under to get outside.
The staff I encountered were all very courteous, even the guy who came to check our mini bar at 22:35! and I can recommend this hotel. However I do suggest that bookings are made though a third party as the savings can be vast.
I can say that I would stay here again.

28,Customers unwanted !,"They don't answer two email request for a reservation, the online reservation system on the site doesn't work.

I tried to book three rooms for two days, but I gave up/ don't want to spend any money there.

They probably don't want customers, my advice to you ... respect their wishes. The service is probably the same, they'll forget about you the moment you paid.

28,romantic hideaway,"Just returned from 2 days at the florida for my husbands birthday. We had a great time, we had a room upgrade and was given champage and chocolate strawberys. The spa is fantastic, take a swimsuit.
The only downside is it is very quiet but we didnt mind that. The restaurant is very expensive our meal was 230 euros but it was good. It says there is a nightclub but it is only open during the week.

28,Fabulous Florida!,"The hotel Gran Florida is an exceptional experience, from the wonderful staff to the beautifully furnished rooms, not forgetting the fantastic pool/spa area.
Well known ´faces´abound, forget the Hotel Arts, this is THE place to stay when in Blarcelona!
The view is amazing.......although it isn't in the city there is a shuttle service to town and isn't it nice to be away from the crowds once in a while?!
",5,2004,12,28
28,An example to all boutique hotels.....,"The Gran Hotel La Florida doesn't pretend that it's in the centre of Barcelona, so don't go if you're looking for a city centre hotel. 

Part of the beauty of this place is it's rural peaceful location with fantastic views over the city, all within a complimentary 15 minute transfer of the centre. Even the basic rooms are a good size and very chic, with stunning bathrooms and plasma TVs. The pool area is fabulous and the spa facilities are excellent. The hotel restaurant is very romantic, dining on the terrace is a particular pleasure and the Sunday brunch buffet with Cava included is a great way to while away a Sunday afternoon. 
My wife and I stayed for three nights at the end of August and although we didn't have great weather we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return. I couldn't recommend this place more highly for a relaxing romantic break in a luxurious and comfortable environment.",5,2004,11,11
28,TERRIBLY LOCATED,"If what you want is to visit the city. Do not stay in this hotel. No taxis nothing to do around the hotel. Nice rooms but very boiring weekend... For a taxi you need to wait minimun 30 minutes ... Terribel experience!! Check the location in a CITY MAP before booking a room here !!!

28,"Stunning views, beautiful hotel.","We stayed at La Florida to celebrate our 10th Wedding anniversary after much research of hotels in Barcelona (inc this site). We chose La Florida as it offered the 'retreat' feel as well as being 'in' Barcelona. 15/20 mins (15/20 euros) in a cab and your in the center of everything. The hotel runs a shuttle bus up and down the montain about 10 times throughout the day and night, but you would be wise to book as on one occasion it was full, all other times just the two of us. 

We opted to book a car with driver from the airport (service offered by hotel) which was a great start to the break. It was 70 euros (inc tax) which is around twice the cost of a taxi, but well worth it. A very polite and informative driver in a beautiful E class mercedes. As you wind your way up the mountain, you keep getting glimpes of the hotel, purching at the top pumping your intrique as to what it's going to be like. From the front, the hotel doesn't look 'that' special, but as soon as you pass through the doors, you know you have arrived somwhere very special. We were seated in two high backed comfy chairs and handed a rather delightful refreshing drink (never did find out what it was) whilst we went through the checking in formalities. We were then given a brief overview and history of the hotel before being shown to our room. I felt that the receptionist (front of house person) who intoduced us to the hotel was very proud of La Florida and he seemed genuinely pleased to be showing us its many charms and features. We had a Garden room (#3) which had a big garden and decked area with a large table and four chairs  & parasol, 2 steamer chairs and a jucuzzi. Fantastic views of Barcelona and the sea beyond. They have  blinds / awnings that you can pull over all the decked areas so those with balconies above can not see you giving you a feeling of total privacy. The room was very nicely furnished with a huge comfy bed with fantastic pillows and realy soft linen, 2 armchairs, desk etc with Plasma TV on the wall at the end of the bed. 3 different huge doors lead to the garden which had the sun in it from morning until late afternoon. The bathroom was huge with a bath, two sinks, fantastic shower room (huge!), a toilet/bidet room and a  copious amount of thick towels, bathrobes and slippers. The room was fantastic, however when lying in bed, you could here doors closing and footsteps in the hall as most common parts has stone/marble floors. 

In my opinion the jewel of the hotel is the terrace which cascades down the mountain. Its beautifully furnished, with lots of thickly cushioned steamer chairs all with fresh towels, parasols tables etc. At the top by the bar area their are lots of different seating options with patio heaters and 'massive' sun canopies. The service here was particuly attentive and polite. In the evening their are lots of candles all the way down the terrace. A DJ, who appears to hide behind the bushes played mellow 'contempory' jazz at a low volume. It was nice for us (mid thirties) but the kind of music that would have my parents muttering discontent. Breakfasts were served either on the terrace in the morning sunshine or inside. Fantastic coffee, freshly squeezed juices and all of the trimmings including a good choice of newspapers from all around the world. We had dinner in the 'Orangry' restaurant on the Friday evening and although it was very busy the service was very good. We sampled the chefs tasting menu for 70 euros a head which was pretty good, but what was better was we opted for the tasting menu with wine for 100 euros which exposed us to five (one for each course) fantastic wines. The somelier explained each one to us in detail and if you liked it, he kept topping up your glass, so we were suitably lubricated as we left.

We arrived on a Thursday, and left on a Sunday. On the Thursday and Friday, it felt like we had the hotel pretty much to ourselves along with a few other decerning travelers and the few business people. On Saturday morning it felt very different, rather busy with a mix of European couples on 'celebratory' weekends (alot of British) and a few families. Also the fair ground across the mountain opens at the weekned, resulting in a lot of traffic (hardly any during the week) and the noise from the fair (not intrusive but there). 

Everywhere was spotless, the health spa and the pool are very difficult the expalain...very 'cool' The hotel has a nice personable feel to it. We took a look at the arts hotel...no thanks...to business like. La Florida is a fantastic hotel to start the day, then to head into town on the free shuttle (don't forget to book) do some sights, have a few beers and tapas, some shopping and when you start to tire know that you can return to La Florida and look down onto the city with a real sense of contentment that you chose this hotel.

We would definitely return and recommend, although would try and incorporate some weekdays for the 'special' feel.

28,"Pure Catalan pleasure....a ""must stay"" hotel","We flew BA business class to Barcelona, so straight away we were being subjected to indulgence, so when we arrived at the hotel we knew we were not going to be disappointed. The hotel is set ina hilltop, over-looking Barcelona city, which is a must to capture on camera. The staff are attentive to the extreme...you certainly are treated like royalty. The decor is second to none. The artwork is asthetically pleasing to the eye. Although the rooms are tastefully decorated, some can seem quite small for such a grandour hotel, so it wasn't a problem for us to be up-graded to a suite (it's worth asking). The marble used in the bathroom is exquisite..the shower-room alone was vast. We had a room with an extensive balcony, with sun-loungers, which gave a fantastic view over Barcelona city. A courtesy bus is provided by the hotel to take you down to the city if you haven't got transport (recommend you get a hire car), however, it is worth booking this well in advance, as it only takes 16 guests.
The Orangery restaurant is excellent. Their monkfish is to die for, and their lamb is wrapped and baked in clay,which they present to you at the table. Their wine list is excellent. The somelier is very knowledgeable and I would recommend asking that he recommends a locally produced Cava. They even have a 1914 fortified wine which is an excellent accompanyment to their vast array of cheeses from around the world.
It is worth asking the front desk to recommend a local vineyard. We visited one in the Pennes region, who spent over 3 hours with us showing his very private vineyard. This was at the most, the highlight of our break.
There must be around 3 staff to each set of guests. This hotel is pure pleasure and a must be stay.
We even had the opportunity to breakfast next to Calista Flockhart (Ally McBeal fame).
I would recommend a massage at least. This is a great finish to the whole experience the hotel provides. It certainly is another world!

28,Feel Like a Princess,"Gran Hotel La Florida is a beautiful five-star hotel overlooking Barcelona.  Customer service was top-notch and very friendly.  Spa facilities including workout room, massages and indoor/outdoor pool were fantastic!  I was wowed by the bathroom in our room!  My friend and I had a cooking class with the chef and enjoyed every bite!  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return in the future!
",5,2004,08,19
28,TOTALLY LOVELY,"I have just left this hotel and am on my way back to the UK. It is really excellent. The food is wonderful, service in the restaurant slow, however the view is enjoyable! - once the food has arrived it is very much worth waiting for.
Rooms are well designed and clean. The journey to Barcelona central is 15mins max but the hotel supply a shuttle service if you don't want to pay for a taxi - if you have been to this city before, it is a lavish place ideal for relaxing in luxury! This is a great place for a 2 day stay.
Swimiing pool and spa facilities are lovely - nicest swimming pool I have ever seen!
",5,2004,07,11
28,Gorgeous and inviting -,"This place is worth every penny - I found a special 1-year anniversary rate and was quite pleased with the service, cleanliness, and overall polished yet unpretentious image.  Sure, it's a 15 euro cab ride from passeig de gracia (center of the city), but don't count that against  them - you should go into it knowing that it's not centrically located. If you're willing to pay the extra cab fares to sit in the lap of luxury, then this is the perfect spot. Stunning views of the city, and a really great indoor/outdoor pool. We had a standard room that was spacious and beautifully decorated. It'll be interesting to see if people like staying here despite it's distance from the city, but I recommend it for a night or two - just for some pampering. If you're going to barcelona to sightsee, and dont want to stay so far away, try the hotel arts. ",5,2004,05,14
28,Far and Away,"After all the press about this hotel, we decided to splurge and stay here on our recent trip to Barcelona. We thought it was really pretty inside, but not very quiet. We could hear all the noise in the hall as the rooms are around an open court. The restraunt was alwful. I would go out for dinner, but therein lies the problem. You are as far from anyplace as you can be. Looking down over the city is nice, but if you want to be in the city, do not stay here. A bit disorganized and not the nicest manager. We won't stay here again. Way too expensive and stuffy. Cabs are cheap, but can take an hour or longer to get there. We felt trapped.",2,2003,11,19
28,Hotel on the hill,"This hotel location is its greatest asset and biggest drawback. The hotel overlooks the and is not accessible by direct subway or other public transportation. It can be reached via three rail, trolley and lift transfer. Take a cab or car if you want to get anywhere on time.It is an excellant retreat overlooking the City. Almost a country hotel for a City trip.The rooms and common areas have been completely remodeled in a very tasteful fashion.The spa is well equiped with high tech machines and the pool is over the top. The service is pleasant but could use a little polish. Spa and steam rooms were not turned on and I had to find someone to open exercise room in the morning. I think a good check list could overcome the problems. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the City is great. I did not have dinner but the restaurant was always crowded at dinner, people eating under the stars and above the clounds.Overall an excellant choice if you want to be away from the bussle of the City. A 15 minute cab ride, 15 euros if you want the bussle.",4,2003,09,07
28,IT'S TIME TO IMPROVE,"Several things to comment on, 1.-the water area was full of children jumping into the water, disturbing the rest of the guests, I understand that if it is a relaxation area this is not the best option. 2.- You pay €25 for parking per day, and the car is outside, it was raining all night and when you picked it up in the morning it was completely wet. 2.- Too many children, at breakfast it seemed like a street rush, the children running to get their chocolates, we had the misfortune that at the next table a child returned everything he had eaten, this can happen, but I think a hotel with those characteristics would have to be Adults Only. 3.- And finally, and as a specific comment, I would not allow people to come down to breakfast in beach flip-flops in a luxury 5-star hotel. It is not very pleasant to be having breakfast looking at people's feet. The hotel would like it. It is missing a start-up (sheet metal and paint) it is true that it was closed for two years due to the pandemic and now we have to generate money to invest in making it beautiful, but it is already needed.",3,2024,03,04
28,Hotel with incredible views and charming place,Fantastic hotel with incredible views over Barcelona. Very close to Tibidado on foot. Very good cuisine with very nice staff.

Afternoon/evening cleaning service is only available every other day; also little attention is paid to room problems and maintenance",3,2024,01,01
28,"In the seemingly most luxurious house, the worst experiences","The hotel was supposed to be the crowning glory of our Cote d'Azur trip - but it didn't happen.
If you like staying away from Barcelona, this is perfect. You have a fantastic view of the city. But you can't get into the city center without a taxi.
The hotel is dirty, the bathroom is moldy, the furniture is broken, the service is lousy. Although we were assured that our dog (30 cm tall) was allowed, we had to eat in the lobby and the wait to be served took 30 minutes. We will definitely never stay here again.",2,2023,10,29
28,The best views in a great hotel,"Magnificent hotel with the best views of Barcelona and great service. Its terrace, pool and spa facilities are still a 10 out of ten.

In August very competitive prices",5,2023,08,06

Lamentablemente, todo el resto no está a la altura, y no es ni la sombra de lo que un día fue. Raciones tacañas (p. ej.  2 espárragos) a precios de alta gastronomía en los entrantes. El pescado del día, una merluza mal cocinada y, lo peor, en malas condiciones, que no se podía comer del mal olor que desprendía. Pedimos una ensalada Cesar’s para por lo menos comer algo: fue peor el remedio que la enfermedad! El Chef debería aprender a preparar este plato tan internacional y conocido. En fin, los precios sí que están a la altura (a gran altura). El servicio, irregular y, en algún caso, muy desaliñado. No volveremos.",1,2023,05,18
28,"Grosse Zimmer, super Aussicht, nettes Personal","Das sehr schöne Hotel La Florida besticht durch die wunderschöne Aussicht über Barcelona, die grossen Zimmer, den schönen Pool und die netten und zuvorkommenden Angestellten.

Das Hotel ist ca. 20 min mit dem Taxi von der Innenstadt entfernt (um 20 EUR). Dafür wird man mit einer grandiosen Aussicht und ruhevollem Aufenthalt belohnt. Das muss jeder für sich selbst entscheiden, ob die Lage für einen Barcelona-Aufenthalt ideal ist. Für einen reinen Shopping-Trip ist eher eine Aufenthalt in der Stadtmitte optimal. Wenn man sich noch ein wenig erholen will, dann ist das La Florida absolut empfehlenswert.

Unser Zimmer 118 hatte einen kleinen Balkon und eine wunderschöne Aussicht über Barcelona. Das Bett war sehr angenehm und bequem. Das Zimmer war generell sehr gross und das Bad ebenfalls. Zimmer in dieser Grösse werden in anderen Hotels eher als 'Junior Suite' verkauft.

Auffallend war bei unserem Aufenthalt, dass ausnahmslos alle Angestellten sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend waren. Insbesondere Chantal im Bar-Bereich hat uns immer mit einem Lächeln und mit zuvorkommenden Service begrüsst. War immer sehr angenehm.

Der Poolbereich (Innen- und Aussenpool) ist sehr schön angelegt, hat eine gut ausgestattete Bar und schöne Liegen. Bei unserem Besuch wurde angefangen, den  Aussenpool zu beheizen. War perfekt - so konnte man scho morgens um 8h, wenn die Pool-Anlage offiziell öffnet, gemütlich Schwimmen gehen. Perfekter Start in den Tag!

Für einen Kombi-Aufenthalt (Shopping / Sightseeing / Erholung) würde ich das Hotel vorbehaltlos empfehlen. Für reines Shopping ist die Lage eher suboptimal.",5,2023,04,24

28,Una gran decepción !!,"Supongo que tenía muchas expectativas por el hecho de ser un hotel 5 * GL, pero realmente más allà de decir que el edificio es precioso y que tiene unas vistas fantásticas a la ciudad y una buena piscina, poco más de bueno puedo decir. Encontré algunos detalles de falta de limpieza y mantenimiento en las instalaciones, sobre todo en la zona de la piscina interior. Pero lo que más me sorprendió fue el servicio del personal de los restaurantes, muy poco profesional y sin iniciativa, tanto en el desayuno, en el almuerzo que hicimos en el bar de la piscina, como en la cena en la terraza. Yo sigo una alimentación de tipo vegana, y me sorprendió que no hubiera en la carta opciones ni tan solo vegetarianas (o al menos marcadas con un símbolo como tal). Sí que es cierto que en el menú del servicio de habitaciones vi 2-3 opciones marcadas con una hoja verde (supuestamente vegetarianas), pero en la carta del bar y en la del restaurante dichas opciones no estaban. Hasta este punto, no sería en si un problema, porqué fuera de carta siempre me pueden ofrecer algun plato, en cualquier bar o restaurante que vaya, por sencillo que sea. Pero resultó que no, el personal fue muy poco flexible, no sabían que ofrecerme, y cuando me ofrecían algo era vegetariano, no vegano, o sea que ni sabían la diferencia. Un camarero joven y novato tuvo encima la osadía de preguntarme que qué tal un txangurro, si me iría bien. Alucinante !! Finalmente, ante la falta de propuestas por parte del encargado, al que hice venir, al ser incapaz el camarero de saber qué ofrecerme, fui yo misma quien le sugerí si me podía hacer el arroz del senyoret solo con verduras. Fueron a consultar al cocinero, y tras una espera eterna, me dijeron que sí podían. El arroz estaba bueno, pero a saber con qué caldo lo hicieron, ya ni quiero saberlo. Al pedir la cuenta, cuál es mi sorpresa que me lo cobran a precio de paella de pescado y marisco !! Me pregunto cómo a estas alturas en qué la comida vegetariana y vegana está ya muy normalizada por todo el mundo, un hotel de esta categoría no esté a la altura, ni que fuera por el hecho de que tienen muchos clientes extranjeros, de países donde aún es más común, con los que seguro querrán quedar mejor que con los clientes locales. Todo sumado, una gran decepción !!

28,No merece ser un 5 estrellas gran lujo y sí un 3 estrellas.,"En el momento de hacer la reserva telefónicamente, insistí que quería una habitación con balcón y con la mesa y sillas correspondientes. Me interesé también por la limpieza del hotel en general ya que del 11 al 13 de junio de 2021 estuvimos en el Hotel Miramar, y en habitación encontramos cucarachas, hormigas en la cama, goteras en el techo, Polvo por todas partes etc
Al llegar al Hotel La Florida, ya me sorprendió tener que abonar por anticipado la estancia completa. Nunca en nuestras estancias en hoteles de 5 estrellas y Relais & Chateaux, hemos tenido que abonar en la recepción nuestra estancia por anticipado. Lo que provoca una sensación de falta de confianza hacia el cliente, aun teniendo el número de mi tarjeta de crédito.
Nuestra primera sorpresa es que, en el balcón, ni sillas ni mesa, detalle que, a pesar de pedirlo, no se cumplió. Fui a recepción y finalmente decidimos no hacer el cambio de habitación.
El sábado después de desayunar, y aprovecho para decirles que el desayuno no contemplaba las expectativas de un hotel de su categoría, pasamos la mañana en la piscina y más tarde comimos en la terraza de la misma. A las 15:30 decidimos ir a la habitación a descansar y cual fue nuestra sorpresa que la habitación no estaba hecha. Bajé a recepción y un empleado suyo de malas maneras me dijo que la normativa del hotel hablaba de que tenían tiempo hasta las 17 h. para realizar la limpieza.
En ningún momento se nos comunicó tal normativa, y sí la de hacer el check in a partir de las 15 h. y el check out a las 12 h., así como el horario de desayunos.
Tardamos mas de media hora en tener la habitación lista, pudiendo descansar en ella a partir de las 16:15 h.
Opino que el Hotel se debe a los clientes y no al revés. El cliente es pieza fundamental para el desarrollo de cualquier Hotel o empresa.
A partir de ahí, observé los detalles de la habitación de los cuales adjunto fotografías. Cabe decir que tuve la oportunidad de hablar con un cliente holandés que opinó lo mismo que yo. Era su tercera estancia y según me comentó, sería la última debido a la limpieza y mantenimiento del Hotel y sus instalaciones.
No es de recibo que un Hotel de 5 estrellas Gran Lujo, tenga el balcón sucio y lleno de telarañas, que falte el mando a distancia del televisor, que coloquen dos tazas con sendos sobres de infusiones sin tener ni cafetera ni hervidor de agua, que la bañera esté en las condiciones de suciedad como demuestran las fotos, que en la ducha al utilizar el grifo de agua fría, quede en mi mano, que la banqueta de los pies de la cama haya tanta suciedad, que en la pared del WC se observen goterones de orina de anteriores clientes, etc. etc.

28,Un hotel único y especial.,"Celebramos el cumpleaños de mi marido y solicité una habitación con vistas y he de decir que no me han defraudado, la habitación era espectacular y las vistas eran increíbles por un lado toda Barcelona y por el otro veiamos las cumbres nevadas de los Pirineos, una sensación única. 
El trato desde el minuto cero atento, servicial pero cercano y acogedor, gracias a todos en general.
La habitación con una cama comodísima y un baño amplio y bien distribuido y al tener una gran terraza y un balcón la sensación de amplitud y luminosidad excepcionales.
Cenamos en Bistro 1925, personal eficiente y muy amable, hicimos una cena de tapas varias y sin quejas de la calidad de lo que comimos, el desayuno muy bien.
Las instalaciones del hotel muy cuidadas y sus terrazas un placer para perderse en las vistas.
Lo recomendamos sin duda ninguna.

28,La magia de un hotel,"Día de parque de atracciones del Tibidabo , regresando tarde al hotel , día de cumpleaños infantil . Cuando entras ya tienes la sensación de transportarte a otra época sin desmerecer la tecnología de un hotel moderno . Habitación con vistas a la ciudad a 360 grados , anochece , nos preparamos para intentar cenar , sin reserva en el restaurante del hotel , nos consiguen mesa , y empieza la magia del detalle porque si los detalles no sorprenden con amor no se produce la magia . No desvelaré el menú degustación , merece mucho la pena visitarlos , un día para recordar . Intenten reservar en días de sol y calor para disfrutar de su espectacular piscina .",5,2019,11,12
28,Preis Leistung unterirdisch,"Das Grand Hotel profitiert vom anhaltenden Barcelona Boom. Heißt auch: Die Gäste kommen - egal wieviel Mühe man sich gibt. Das Personal ist bis auf wenige Ausnahmen nicht geschult - weiß nicht, was 5 Sterne bedeuten und man Gäste auf diesem Niveau hofiert. Club Sandwich für 18 Euro mit trockenem Brot ein schlechter Scherz am Pool. Sicherlich werden wir dieses Hotel nicht mehr aufsuchen.",1,2019,11,05
28,Muy Gran Hotel La Florida,"Pareja
Descubrí por Internet el Gran Hotel la Florida y quise dar una sorpresa a mi pareja. Y fué acertada.
No conocia este paraiso!
Solicité detalles para sorprenderla. Champany, fresas con xocolate, ramo de rosas, desayuno en la habitación y check out a las 14h.
Llegamos al hotel y en recepción nos atendieron ràpido, muy amables y con discreción de los detalles solicitados, ya que estaba mi pareja presente y no sabia nada. Fué perfecto el check in. Todo ofreciéndonos una copa de xampany solo llegar. De inmediato nos ofrecieron un tour por el hotel y enseñarnos las instalaciones y servícios que ofrecian en el cielo del Gran Hotel la Florida. Que maravilla! Que bonito todo, todo.
Llegamos a la habitación, 208 una suite de lujo a dos vientos con ventanales de estilo franc és. Vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona a la que nosotros la bautizamos como la pecera de feliz, preciosa. Éramos como dos peces mirando como anochecia y sin saber si eran màs bonitas las vistas que ofrecian a la ciudad de dia o de noche. 19:30h llega el servicio de habitaciones con un ramo de rosas rojas, champany y fresas con chocolate. Tacto y amabilidad del camarero de habitación perfecta. Gracias. Mi pareja aun creia que estaba en un sueño y decidió no despertar, o no querer dormirse para disfrutar de cada momento, de cada lugar del hotel.
A la mañana vino un àngel con el desayuno, que no ahorró detalle alguno en explicaciones de cada una de las delicatesse servidas y elaboradas por el excente servicio de cocina. Gracias, todo delicioso. 
No queríamos irnos de nuestra pecera. Bajamos, mucho màs tarde, rosas en mano, a recepción. Check out. Snif. Ha sido fantasia hecha realidad, nos habeis sorprendido y tratado de manera inmejorable, calidez y cariño. Gracias, muchas gracias de verdad de la buena. Este Gran Hotel y su personal se nos a grabado para siempre en nuestros corazones. Volveremos seguro. 

Una maravilla. Un balcón a Barcelona. Todavia no hemos salido del hotel y ya queremos volver. Las instalaciones , los servicios que ofrecen, el trato amable, el magnífico personal... Que os suban el sueldo y os den màs vacaciones. Sois Excelentes. Muchas gracias a todos. Nos veremos pronto.
Besos y abrazos,
Montse y Ramon",5,2019,11,03
28,Espada romántica al cielo de Barcelona,"Nos dimos un capricho para celebrar nuestro 30 aniversario y quedamos realmente satisfechos.
Upgrade de regalo: La habitación con vistas a la ciudad y al Tibidabo espectaculares, de lujo.
Cena degustación con maridaje en el Barcelonas de inolvidable recuerdo con una atención inmejorable.
El Spa, los muchos rincones para el descanso y la lectura, la contemplación de la ciudad a nuestros pies... nos faltaron horas para disfrutarlo todo.
La única pega fue la relación precio/calidad de la cena en el Bristo1925. En nuestra opinión mejorable.",5,2019,10,12
28,Patetico,"Timadura de pelo, malo y caro. Comida pesima a precios desorbitados, algo ilogico para el sitio donde está, muy decepcionado, nunca más. Adjunto una foto de la cuenta para ver los precios, eramos 2 personas.",1,2019,07,27
28,Barcelona a tus pies...,"De los mejores hoteles de Barcelona, en todos los aspectos. un lugar para desconectar de todo y todos. muy buena comida, la que ofrece en todos sus restaurantes. un spa espectacular y sin olvidar se de las vistas!",5,2019,07,19
28,Muy bien!!,"La terraza es espectacular. Hemos estado tomando algo con unos amigos muy fresquitos, un día que en Barcelona hace mucho calor. Es posible aparcar en la entrada del hotel. El trato es excelente y el precio, muy ajustado.",5,2019,07,07
28,Hat die besten Tage hinter sich!,"Die Punkte gibt es für die Aussicht, welche einmalig ist. Das war es leider schon mit den positiven Aspekten.
Das Hotel wirkt heruntergekommen und alt, Preis/Leistung stimmen da null!
Es gibt genau 10 Liegen am Pool, quasi keine Chance eine zu ergattern. Der Spa ist lächerlich, zudem herrscht dort reger „Toiletten Verkehr“ der Bistro Besucher- mit Straßen Schuhe! Sehr entspannend und hygienisch, wie man sich vorstellen kann. Wir waren sehr traurig und enttäuscht, unter einen 5 Sterne Hotel haben wir uns etwas anderes vorgestellt. ",2,2019,06,18
28,RESTAURACIÓN <* (0),"Quizás deba dejar de ir a este restaurante que parece ser su establecimiento como Gran Hotel ***** la restauración no es lo suyo. Ambos comensales (2), desistimos en el segundo intento iniciar y terminar nuestro plato. Sólo un solo corte en mi plato y solo una pieza de 6 en el otro plato. Menos mal del aperitivo que al no tener sello de la cocina (jamón serrano y quesos), pudimos más o menos decir que habíamos cebado. 
Servicio excepcional. Pero no tuvieron en cuenta los dos segundos abandonados en la factura. 
Señora Cristiana Roures, la Dirección de ese hotel no merece esa cocina. Lo siento pero nefasto. Consulte mi comanda de dos Petronas del día 12/06 y de importe 232,00 €. Propina incluida. ",1,2019,06,14
28,Heruntergekommene Pracht,"Schöne Lage mit phantastischem Blick auf die Stadt, allerdings mit dem Nachteil einer weiten Taxi-Fahrt ins Zentrum(20 Min.,25€). Es kann auch vorkommen ,dass man nachts auf der Rückfahrt Probleme hat, eine Fahrt zu finden oder Mond-Preise aufgerufen werden.
Das Hotel macht insgesamt einen etwas heruntergekommenen und renovierungsbedürftigen Eindruck.In unserem Zimmer veraltete Einrichtung ,defekte, fehlende Badezimmer-Tür, Spuren von Wasser-Schäden im Bad, verrostete Balkon-Geländer.    Die Sauberkeit, zum Beispiel auf der Terrasse des Restaurants mangelhaft, ungepflegter Boden,viele Stühle mit Vogel-Kot. Auswahl und Qualität des Essens eher durchschnittlich.     Service insgesamt nicht unfreundlich, aber häufig überfordert und langsam.            Insgesamt hat dieses Hotel definitiv kein 5-Sterne-Niveau,vor allem, wenn man die guten Alternativen in Barcelona vergleicht. Der schöne Blick allein reicht bei weitem nicht aus, um all die Mängel auszugleichen.",2,2019,06,10
28,Vista spettacolare ,"Vista spettacolare su Barcellona, per questo hotel proprio sulla sommità del Tibibado. Bella la piscina, stanze grandi, buon servizio. 
L’unica pecca sono state pranzi/cene (ero ad un meeting di lavoro), dove i buffet era veramente ripetitivi e non molto buoni",4,2019,05,26
28,BODA ESPECTACULAR-IS A MUST,"El mejor hotel en Barcelona para celebrar una boda con clase e íntima.
La clase, el saber hacer y la elegancia de empleados, instalaciones y servicios son insuperables.
Sofía, que organizó la boda, es un tesoro.
Todo perfecto. Muy por encima de cualquier espectativa y a un precio muy correcto y acorde con la clase del hotel.
Puede que en el pasado haya tenido algún fallo, pero las opiniones negativas que hay en TA desde luego hoy en día no son aplicables.
Por favor los habituales de los bares de polígono no opinéis que estáis amargados por los 1000 euretes mensuales que ganáis y este sitio os está grande. Y lo que hacéis es embrutecer las opiniones reales de los que si que estamos destinados a este tipo de gran hotel.
La Verdad Duele",5,2019,04,28
28,Celebración aniversario,"Espectaculares vistas de Barcelona. Alucinante la habitación, espaciosa y muy cómoda y con una decoración y servicios muy cuidado. Saludo en especial a Claudia que nos atendió con un trato exquisito y darles las gracias por los detalles que hicieron que la estancia fuera inolvidable.
Terrazas para disfrutar de las vistas en buena compañía y mención al spas y su fabulosa piscina de acero inoxidable.
Sin duda volveremos a repetir!!!",5,2019,04,17
28,Café con las mejores vistas y un trato excelente,Fuí una tarde a tomar un café con unas amigas y recomendable 100%! Trato de 5 estrellas por parte de los trabajadores y unas vistas increíbles de Barcelona. Una manera diferente de conocer la ciudad desde lo alto!

100% Recomendable y repetiremos seguro!",5,2019,04,04
28,"Hotel con un servicio de masages impresionante, vale la pena.","Hotel súper agradable con habitaciones grandes y cama muy cómoda. Aunque que el hotel esté en Barcelona, se requiere medio de transporte ya que está al lado del Tibidabo con muy buenas vistas a Barcelona. Ideal para desconectar.
Nosotros lo que queremos descatar sobretodo es el Spa con un servicio impecable, unas profesionales muy atentas que te hacen vivir una experiencia inolvidable. Desde el momento que entras allí, te ayudan a relajarte completamente y están por ti a 100%. gracias a todas por el excelente trabajo y profesionalismo. Volveremos encantadas.",5,2019,03,31
28,Kurzurlaub ,"Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter war in allen Bereichen vorhanden. Aufmerksamkeit und hilfsbereit. 
Im Zimmer hat es leider im Bad nach Schimmel gerochen sehr penetrant doch die Aussicht war wunderschön - siehe Bild. 
In der Damensauna hatten wir ein sehr unangenehmes Erlebnis- benutzte und schmutzige Badetücher und Mäntel lagen in der Sauna, die obere liege Flächen sind bereits sehr schräg sehen aus als würden die Bank brechen. Die Duschen waren sehr schmutzig. 
Im Frühstück wir Egg Benedict angeboten jedoch konnte der Koch es eindeutig nicht zubereiten - pochiertes Ei war gekocht und Sauce Hollandaise war wie klare Suppe am Teller. 
Alle Punkte wurden beim Check out angegeben. ",3,2019,03,10
28,Top Hotel - nur bei gutem Wetter geeignet,"Top Hotel, top Service, top Terrasse und Spa, top Blick vom Gipfel des Tibidabo direkt neben dem Freizeitpark (den man nicht hört). Etwa 15 Minuten ins Zentrum (Placa Catalunya) mit dem Bus oder Taxi. Es gibt kein Hoteleigenes Shuttle. Schöner Poolbereich (innen & außen). Insgesamt sehr ruhig. 

Leider hatten wir 3 von 4 Tagen Pech mit dem Wetter dadurch war die Sicht sehr eingeschränkt weil man quasi in den Wolken wohnt oder darüber. Zudem ist ein starker Hurricane aus Portugal über Barcelona gefegt und die doch schon etwas in die Jahre gekommene Balkontür hat dem nicht Stand gehalten und sprang Nachts auf, sodass wir innerhalb Minuten packen und das Zimmer wechseln mussten. Dies war aber Dank des hilfsbereiten Personals kein Problem.

Das Essen war insgesamt in Ordnung aber keine Spitzenklasse.",5,2019,02,21
28,Hotel la florida ,"Trato por parte del personal excelente. Nos alojamos en una suit en la 6 planta con vistas al tibidabo. Cama cómoda y el desayuno en la cama tremendo. Única pega las ventanas, cuando hay aire entra y tienes ruido por la noche. 
Recalcar, el servicio de spa, en concreto los masajes. Excepcional, me tocó con Ester y es una profesional de pies a cabeza. 100% recomendable. ",4,2019,02,10
28,Calidad-Precio bien,"Pasamos una noche y todo fue muy bien excepto 2 temas: 
1. No había albornoces para bajar al spa y nos dijeron que había un problema con el proveedor. 
2. En el plato de ducha había una rachola de haber hecho obra y el cristal de la mampara estaba rajado (aunque se sostenía).

Estos 2 hechos no son acordes a un 5 estrellas GL.

El resto muy bien calidad-precio. ",4,2019,02,04
28,"Bueno hotel, pero no tiro cohetes.","La piscina está muy bien, las vistas son geniales, y la suite grande con dos habitaciones es genial y espaciosa. Sin embargo la comida fue una pena, y que me quisieran cobrar el desayuno cuando estaba incluido en la master suite solo por subírmelo a la habitación me parece querer sacar más de donde ya no hace falta sacar más. Después les escribí para comentarles que esto me desagradó, y ni siquiera me contestaron.
Dudo mucho que vuelva.",3,2019,01,21

Hotel che cura il dettaglio!La Spa non è molto grande, Jacuzzi e piscina interna ed esterna con vista! Bei momenti in un luogo che ricorderò! ",5,2018,11,06
28,Buenas vistas y buen hotel,"el hotel sigue con su política de contentar a su publico el restaurante esta bien y es necesario ya que esta lejos del centro de Barcelona las habitaciones cambian mucho si son con vistas a la ciudad o no , el bar concurrido en la tarde de los fines de semana con publico agradable, lo mejor la decoración y las vistas",4,2018,09,26
28,Espectacular ,"Es un remanso de paz y tranquilidad con unas vistas y unas instalaciones de ensueño

28,Todo es bello pero no muy amigable,"Un hotel encantador con buenas vistas en la recepción sin una botella de champán prometida para el desayuno. También vale la pena el champán, nadie lo abre y todo está delicioso. No hay una tienda donde puedas comprar agua y comer algo",4,2018,09,07
28,trato nefasto,"Fuimos a comer un domingo al mediodía al Bistrot. La camarera que nos atendió (francesa que no dominaba el español), tenia algún problema no se muy bien con quien ni con qué, pero era sinceramente una impertinente y una amargura que no regaló ni media sonrisa.... Pagamos por comer 4 personas 190 € (dos primeros mínimos a compartir (osea un aperitivito) y cada uno un segundo mini, con botella de vino y postre) y este precio merece que cuando sales a tomarte el café en la terraza: 1º: no tengas al lado a un troglodita semidesnudo que no sabe comer con vestimenta adecuada y que nadie le dice nada. 2º intentamos ponernos en primera linea de las vistas (que es lo único que valía la pena) y desde unos 50 metros salió a voces nuestra camarera diciendo no se puede ahí!!. Por fin nos sirven cafés para 4,  bueno 25 € más...En definitiva si pagas eso, ni quiero un troglodita al lado comiendo como un mono semidesnudo, y no quiero que avisar a la camarera porque me falta algo y que me conteste : ahora no puedo! (de mala manera) y nunca vuelva a ver que quería...la comida no valiía gran cosa (por ese precio he probado mil veces cosas mejores y sí...no es ese entorno quizás...pero es otro tb con encanto y maravilloso...En definitiva del 1 al 10 le doy un uno por la vistas, el resto 0.  El que manda o dirige la restauración no lo hace bien y por tanto el personal no sirve, y el servicio al final es cero. NO vuelvo. Gracias",1,2018,08,29
28,Experiencia diferente para conocer BCN,"Se trata de un 5*GL situado en un lugar privilegiado. Es general bastante bien, quizás demasiados franceses y el servicio muy orientado a ellos, La cocina pasable para ser 5*, pero el precio tampoco es desmesurado. Salvo el desayuno , pues no es diferente de un desayuno 4*S y cuesta el doble. Lo mejor, la piscina y las vistas.",4,2018,08,25
28,COCKTAIL EN LA TERRAZA,"Estuve con unas amigas para celebrar el reencuentro del verano y fue espantoso el servicio.   Para llegar a la terraza nadie te indica y está complicado.  Una vez en la terraza parecíamos invisibles.  Pedimos un poco de agua para quitar una mancha y tardaron tanto que la mancha se secó, la camarera nos miraba como si no nos entendiera y al final nos trajo un vaso de agua con cubitos para beber.  Un desastre.  jamás volveré.  La vista bonita pero el servicio horrendo.",1,2018,08,21
28,Cumpleaños Feliz!,"Celebramos mi cumpleaños en la terraza de La Florida, en el Spa, la Piscina... El lugar es maravilloso, vistas geniales y verdaderamente bonito. Gracias a Abel por su predisposición, a María de conserjería por como nos recibió y al camarero francés de la terraza, que a pesar de llevar solo 3 semanas trabajando parecía conocer la casa a la perfección. Muy recomendable si vives en Barcelona y quieres relajarte fuera de la ciudad sin recorrer muchos kms. Volveremos!!!",5,2018,08,14
28,Grata experiencia,"Este hotel es encantador y dispone de unas instalaciones muy cálidas y discretas.
El servicio del personal es excelente y las habitaciones muy bien cuidadas.

Las Penthouse Suites son muy confortables y espaciosas, perfectas para un fin de semana de relax en pareja.",4,2018,08,13
28,Espectacular ,"He venido en varias ocasiones a este hotel , tanto en invierno como en verano y el servicio y la atención han sido siempre fantásticas , la única diferencia es el clima y que no aprovechas la zona exterior . Pero la calidad que ofrece y el trato exquisito .
En esta última visita destacó las buenas recomendaciones de una de sus camareras ( Xenia ) y el trato amable del personal en general . 
El hotel además de las vistas tiene una carta de menús degustación exquisita !
Sin duda volveré a venir .",5,2018,07,30
28,Excelente,Solo lo puedo calificar como excelente. Por su situación. Por servicio y por la calidad. Recomiendo totalmente cenar en el restaurante del hotel Prive Barcelonas. Tiene un menú degustación que está a la altura. Y resalto el servicio. El personal es espectacular. Son auténticos profesionales. Solo puedo decir. Muchas felicidades por todo. Si señores. Así se trabaja,5,2018,07,28
28,"Terraza bonita, servicio pésimo","Les Terrasses Bar&Lounge, tienen unas vistas privilegiadas de la ciudad, pero el servicio es pésimo.
Aunque haya mesas libres ante las vistas a mar, no te las ofrecen, y una vez sentado, tardaron casi una hora en atendernos, sin estar las mesas llenas ni ser una hora conflictiva. Los camareros y camareras pasaban por delante sin mirar ni preguntar.
Muy poco profesional.
La carta es buena y los ingredientes de calidad, pero la cantidad es irrisoria (un entrante de ceviche con 5 trozos tamaño sugus, surtido de quesos con ocho trozos tamaño sugus...)",1,2018,07,08
28,Hotel tranquilo con excelentes vistas,"Es un hotel clásico con bastante zona exterior de jardines, terrazas y piscina. Las vistas desde el hotel son sensacionales. Puedes divisar toda la ciudad de Barcelona y perder tu vista en el horizonte. Si lo que quieres es hacer turismo urbano, no es muy recomendable, puesto que está en la montaña y alejado del centro. Si buscas desconectar y tranquilidad, el lugar es perfecto.",4,2018,05,29
28,Diesmal war ich enttäuscht über Service und Qualität... auf der Terrasse,"Die Ausicht von der Terrasse ist und bleibt einmalig. Ich war schon oft hier, aber dieses Mal war vermutlich das letzte Mal. Die Terrasse war fast leer - die Tische jedoch dreckig. Der einzige Kellner war leicht überfordert und ein Abwischen des Tischs schien nicht möglich. Haben uns ein paar Snacks bestellt - allesamt waren nicht schmackhaft (mini Hamburger; Hummus; Nachos...). Wir haben, trotz der Aussicht, die (hohe) Rechnung verlangt und sind gegangen.",2,2018,05,28
28,"Sube a las nubes, disfruta de las vistas y descansa cómo un Dios","El Gran Hotel Monumento La Florida, es un establecimiento de 5 * GL, en él que vas a descansar cómo si fueses dios, la comodidad de sus colchones es impresionante.
Ahora bien el Hotel si por algo se distingue es por sus impresionantes vista sobre Barcelona hasta el mar, así cómo por el otro lado toda la plana del Vallés. Sólo por esto ya merece la pena alojarse o disfrutar de éste Hotel.
Sus instalaciones están muy bien, tiene una magnífica piscina de la que disfrutar todo el año, jacuzzi, saunas, gimnasio, etc así como servicio de SPA.
El Hotel tiene un jardín terraza en él que se puede disfrutar en su terraza de una magnífica copa o comida y de las impresionantes vistas, también disponen de un jardín interior para los días de mal tiempo.
Los salones son amplios y cómodos para un relax tranquilo con una decoración muy acorde al lugar de gran belleza.

Disponen de 2 restaurantes con buenas cartas y variedades.

Las habitaciones son amplias y con todo lo necesario, el baño es completo y grande con bañera y ducha y todo lo necesario. Dicho esto destacar las camas comodisimas pero en las decoración y mobiliario de las habitaciones se nota un poco la edad del Hotel.
Nuestra habitación disponía de dos pequeñas terraza y que decir de las vistas, son IMPRESIONANTES !!!! 
Disponen de aparcamiento y es recomendable reservar ya que no es muy grande.

Disponen de un servicio de lanzadera que te acerca al centro de la Ciudad.
En definitiva un Hotel muy recomendable para gente romántica y que quiere tranquilidad y poder relajarse cerca del bullicio de la gran ciudad.

Muy recomendable!!!!",4,2018,05,25
28,Le sobra el GL,"Es un hotel que no tiene ningún tipo de mantenimiento y el servicio nada delicado.
Solo llegar al hotel, en el porche de acceso del hotel, lleno de goteras, no sabía dónde ponerme si en el porche o en la calle para fumarme un cigarro.
Entré en la habitación, la verdad q muy espaciosa, pero solo entrar, veo una lámpara con la pantalla torcidita no, torcidisima!!! Segundo signo de dejadez
En el correspondiente baño, por cierto, inmenso, con una alógena fundida.
Di opción al segundo día para encontrarme La Luz repuesta, y nada.... encima me encontré los pijamas tirados en una butaca en lugar de ponerlos en la cama.
Aahhh!!! Y los cristales sucios (de días)
Por la mañana justamente a las 10:30 llamo a recepción para preguntar hasta que hora es el desayuno y me contesta una chica diciéndome q era hasta las 10:30 acompañada con una risita como diciendo : “mala suerte...”
Menos mal q no fui con intención de disfrutar del hotel, llego a quedarme el día entero me hubiera dado para escribir un libro.
Creo q si quieren continuar con la misma política mejor que hagan una inversión de toallas y albornoces nuevos y se ahorran el poner GL despues de las estrellitas, porque  la decepción del cliente se magnifica. 
",2,2018,05,02
28,Un break en la semana,"Hotel la Florida, en carretera Rabassada de Barcelona, excelentes vistas, un maravillosa terraza con piscina y un precioso lobby. 
Ideal para hacer un desayuno, un brunch, o un aperitivo en ese entorno y desconectar, o una reunión de negocios donde quedar bien. 
Excelente decoración.
Personalmente creo que el restaurante no tiene buena relación calidad precio, solo 4 platos principales, y otros 4 entrantes, a unos precios desorbitados para el tamaño y calidad. 140€ una comida para 2 personas, sin postre, y no estando conforme con uno de los 3 platos para 2 que pedimos, ningún comentario ni disculpa. 
Con lo cual, lo recomiendo muchísimo para una cerveza la sol, un brunch, y disfrutar de las vistas y la tranquilidad, no de la gastronomía.",4,2018,04,10
28,¡No es un gran lujo sino un engaño!,"Cogí habitación con vistas al mar y me la asignaron con vistas a la ciudad y montaña, en la primera planta, y con un árbol que lo tapaba todo. Al bajar a desayunos, la azafata que acomoda, nos pidió esperar a que acabara de enseñarle todo el buffet al huésped de delante nuestro, es decir, 5 minutos de pie, quietos, por carecer el salón de personal (en un gran lujo, bastante lamentable). Básicamente, no repetiría en este hotel, ni de asomo.",1,2018,04,01
28,Toller Business Trip,"Wir waren für einige Tage mit einer größeren Gruppe vor Ort. Der Blick auf sie Stadt und das Meer von der Terrasse war wirklich toll. Auf der Terasse kann man toll sitzen und den Ausblick genießen. Dafür, dass es im März einen Wintereinbruch gab und wir diese kaum nutzen konnten, kann das Hotel nichts. Etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig ist, dass man durch den Pool/Spa-Bereich mit normalen Schuhen auf die Terrasse gehen muss. Die Fitnessgeräte stehen ebenfalls im Poolbereich und nicht in einem separaten Bereich. Der Pool  ist recht lang, so dass man schon ganz ordentlich schwimmen kann. Separat gibt es noch eine Art Whirpool. Das Mittagessen wurde im Bistro als Drei Gang Menu serviert. Qualität und Services war sehr gut. Man kann im Bistro auch a la carte essen. Wir hatten ein Abendessen in einer Art Private Dining Room. Etwas irritierend, da wir in diesem Raum tagsüber auch unsere Meetings hatten, aber das Essen und der Service haben überzeugt. Die Zimmer sind sehr groß, haben einen Schreibtisch und auch ein großes Bad. Je nachdem wie man wohnen möchte, aber 20-30 Minuten Taxifahrt bis in die Innenstadt muss man schon einrechnen. Zum Flughafen mit dem Taxi ca. 45 Euro.",4,2018,03,25
28,Bellissimo,"Bellissima sia la vista, che la struttura incredibile, è un hotel cinque stelle gran lusso, attenzione ai dettagli maniacale e personale sorridente e cordiale. 

Prezzi per quanto riguarda la caffetteria altissimi una spremuta allungata con l’acqua o con succo di arancia viene a costare €7, un succo normale di frutta cinque. 

Considerata la vista e come si viene accolti, investimento meritato.",4,2018,03,25
28,Impresionates vistas,"Auque esté algo alejado de la ciudad, este muy buen hotel reune muchas buenas ofertas, habitaciones amplias y muchas de ellas con excepcionales vistas sobre la ciudad, un buen servicio y una buena restauración. Buen equilibrio general. ",4,2018,03,10
28,Le sobra el GL,"Un gran hotel en bcn, la ubicación única y bonita para las vistas de Barcelona, pero la carretera de curvas es lo peor, el hotel con su personal es de lo mejor, la cena en el restaurante Barcelona 1925,cara no, lo siguiente, la bebida un abuso, agua 6€,cerveza 7€, infusión 6€,ami gusto excesivo, la comida normal por el precio alto.. las instalaciones muy limpias con el personal súper atento, el tema del parking exterior es otro tema k no nos gustó... 21€ noche en la calle i si lo pides k te lo dejen al parquing del hotel es de 21€ igual, sino ay que aparcar 500m cuesta abajo y subir i bajar con las maletas.. detalles que no nos gustaron por ser un hotel GL...el spa justito, la terraza espectacular",4,2018,03,08
28,"Buen Hotel, caríssimo restaurante","El hotel y el Spa están muy bien.
El restaurante tiene una carta poco variada y el servicio es muy justito.
Precios injustificados para comida mediocre.
La vista es excelente.
El servicio muy afrancesado, ninguno hablaba español.
Es la segunda vez que lo visito porque las vistas son geniales, pero no volveré porque es caríssimo  por lo que recibis a cambio",4,2018,02,19
28,Buen hotel con un SPA que no está a la altura,"Nuestra estancia fue muy buena, al llegar nos sirvieron una copa de cava y nos hicieron un upgrade de habitación con vistas a la ciudad (inmejorables). 
La habitación era muy espaciosa y el baño espectacular, aunque la bañera un poco pequeña. 
El desayuno ofrece mucha variedad y estaba todo muy bueno. 
Nos hicimos un masaje en el spa l’Occitane y fue maravilloso. 

Lo malo:
Nos esperábamos mucho más del spa, solo dispone de una piscina (que para nuestra sorpresa, el agua estaba fría), un jacuzzi y sauna (en vestuarios por tanto separas por sexo). No había personal controlando la zona. 
El servicio de habitaciones nos dejó perplejos, por la mañana, al no tener puesto el no molestar, entraron las de la limpieza mientras dormiamos (9.15am). 
El personal es un poco escaso, tuvimos que llamar varias veces a recepción pra que nos plancharan una camisa y nos la devolvieran. 

Según nuestra opinión, es un gran hotel pero deben cuidar un poco más esos pequeños detalles. ",4,2018,02,18
28,Un día muy romántico ,"Es la segunda vez que vamos a este magnífico hotel, y tengo que decir que es fantástico, celebramos un día muy especial, todo es perfecto, si tengo que poner un pero, sería que esperaba que la bañera fuera un poco más grande...
Las vistas son espectaculares y las hemos podido disfrutar tanto de día como de noche.
El lugar es ideal para cualquier celebración especial, espero volver otro día, quizás en mi cumpleaños.",5,2018,02,17
28,Aniversario pareja,"En teoria GL pero nada más lejos de la realidad: 
En nuestro pack love actually incluia unas fresas y cava, tardaron tres horas en llegar después de reclamarlo....
Para relajar la espera, un baño, que sorpresa al comprobar que el agua salia marronosa, en el baño faltaban cosas esenciales como el secador, un simple peine o cepillo de dientes.
Si vais al Spa no os ducheis no sale agua caliente.
El horario de desayuno pone hasta las 11, ojo porque a las 10.30 retiran el buffet.
El local del Restaurante Barcelona cerrado, el menu degustación lo sirven en el bar, eso si, vistas espectaculares.
Para rematar después del check out, nos dieron las llaves del coche diciendo que estaba fuera en la entrada, ni nos sacaron el equipaje y para colmo el coche no estaba como nos indicaron.
El personal amable pero desbordado totalmente.
Por desgracia nos olvidamos una cadena de oro en la mesita de noche, llamamos de inmediato desde casa, era un recuerdo familiar, no ha aparecido, es una lástima pero lo peor es que habiendo insistido al hotel, y prometernos revisar la habitacion, hablar con gobernanta... todavia esperamos su respuesta.

28,Fantastische Aussicht und Historie allein machen es nicht.....,"Sicherlich ist die Lage des Hotels mit fantastischem Blick auf Barcelona das eigentliche Highlight. Wir hatten eine Ausflug auf den Tibidabo gemacht und ich war als Leaders Club Mitglied auf dieses Gran Hotel gespannt. Die Anfahrt von der Innenstadt mit dem Taxi dauert ca. 20 min. und kostet ca. 20,- Euro. Zunächst muss die herrliche Außenterrasse erwähnt werden, wovon man eine fantastische Aussicht auf Barcelona und das Mittelmeer hat. Das im Jahre 1925 erbaute Hotel hat schon eine recht lange Geschichte hinter sich, u.a. vom Militärkrankenhaus zum heutigen Luxushotel. Das Restaurant machte auf mich von der Einrichtung einen eher einfachen Eindruck. Auch der so gelobte SPA mit Innen- und Außenpool (37-Meter lang) war zwar recht groß, aber ohne weitere Besonderheiten, im Gegenteil...die Fitness-Geräte standen lieblos im Poolbereich. Von der Außenterrasse mussten wir durch den Poolbereich zu den Sanitär - Räumlichkeiten, die auf uns nicht den gepflegtesten Eindruck machten. Aber vielleicht lag es an den vielen ""Außer-Haus-Gästen"" an diesem Tag, die für den Gesamteindruck für uns bestimmend waren. Ein Renovierungsbedarf war für uns in diesem Bereich offensichtlich, wenn man sich weiterhin mit der absoluten Luxushotellerie messen lassen will. Die fantastische Aussicht und die Historie allein machen es nicht....! Der Service war aufmerksam, wenn auch nicht hervorragend. Zum Beispiel bestellten wir mehrere Gläser Champagner, die u.E. aber definitiv nicht frisch waren; vielmehr einen fahlen, abgestandenen Eindruck auf uns machten....",3,2018,02,12
28,Servicio habitaciones,"Un excelente hotel donde destacan los detalles... Sobretodo, el servicio de su excelente personal. Nos hizo la habitación una chica que creo recordar se llamaba ""Doris” un trato magnifico de principio a fin. Desde el primer día hasta el ultimo, nos llamo la atención TODO, pero sobretodo el servicio de habitaciones. Volveremos! ",5,2018,02,07
28,Tranquilo y muy acogedor,"Hotel tranquilo, cómodo con personal muy atento. Las habitaciones muy bien equipadas y acogedoras. Las instalaciones son excelentes. Queda apartado del bullicio de la ciudad lo que proporciona tranquilidad y desconexión. Ideal para pasar un fin de semana de relax, celebrar una boda o una reunión de negocios. ",5,2018,02,01
28,Kurzer stop zur teatime,"Für eine kleine Pause hielten wir hier inne.

28,Grandisimo hotel ¡,"Desde la ubicación, las maravillosas vistas, el trato impecable por parte del personal, es un hotel 10, el desayuno era asombroso y en el restaurante con unas vistas asombrosas... cenamos genial. Es de los mejores hoteles que me he alojado.",5,2018,01,10
28,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"Hemos ido a celebrar el cumpleaños de mi pareja y la verdad es que ha sido el mejor día de nuestra vida:

El hotel está situado en la montaña, con las mejores vistas de la ciudad (os lo dice alguien de Barcelona). Levantarse de la cama y ver la ciudad a tus pies, no tiene precio.

La habitación espectacular: la calidad de la cama, la limpieza, el tamaño, la ducha, las amenities occitane...

El desayuno de una calidad y presentación inmejorable: los zumos naturales, los cafés, los embutidos y los quesos, los yogures, tartas, bollería...todo espectacular.

Y lo mejor de todo: el servicio. Desde el recepcionista, hasta el camarero, todos me han transmitido mucho cariño y una sonrisa.

¡Muchas gracias a todo el equipo del Gran Hotel La Florida!",5,2018,01,04
28,Agradecimiento a Doña Cristina Roures,"No quería dejar la ocasión para agradecer a la Directora General, Doña Cristina Roures,  su atención a mi comentario respecto a algo puntual, que en su momento ocurrió, con motivo de mi cena en el restaurante el pasado año en estas fechas. Comentar que posteriormente a esa estancia, repetí de nuevo cena en su restaurante y estuvo, como no podía ser de otra manera, perfecto. Felicidades. 
Añadir y como critica a TripAdvisor que, no entiendo como no se pueden hacer comentarios posteriores respecto al primero y respecto al mismo establecimiento, hasta pasados unos meses. Debiera ser inmediato. Mi respuesta al GRAN HOTEL FLORIDA hubiera podido ser casi un año antes. Ello produce cierta anomalía que no deja de perjudicar al establecimiento. 
FELIZ NAVIDAD.  ",5,2017,12,23
28,THIS IS IT!,"Obwohl ich schon seit 1999 in Barcelona unterwegs bin, habe ich im Jahr 2017 erst diesen Ort entdeckt. Nun, es bedarf einer ausgiebigen Wanderung, um das Hotel zu erreichen, es liegt in Transsilvanien Barcelonas und es ist in etwa so schwierig erreichbar. Dieser Ort ist einfach unglaublich und atemberaubend. Das Hotel ist sehr kostenintensiv, doch nicht teurer als andere Luxushotels in der Stadt. Die Aussicht ist atemberaubend. Man kann auch als Tagesgast die Terrasse nutzen und einen schönen Nachmittag in der Sonne verbringen. Mein Tipp ist, einfach mal als Besucher zu zweit hundert Euro für Essen und Getränke bereit halten, oder auch nur mal eine Nacht dort verbringen und nicht an das Geld denken. Es lohnt sich, denn aus meiner Sicht war ein Besuch in einem Hotel noch nie derart prägend wie hier. Wenn ich dort bin, fühle ich mich wie im Paradies. Übrigens besonders empfehlenswert in den Monaten Dezember, Januar, Februar und März, denn zu der Zeit ist der Freizeitpark, der sich in der näheren Umgebung befindet, geschlossen, und es ist dann wesentlich ruhiger.",5,2017,12,22
28,Magnífico hotel con excelente servicio,"El Hotel es muy agradable con vistas espectaculares de Barcelona y el Tibidabo. El servicio y la atención son magníficos, una joya en las afueras de la ciudad. La terraza es muy agradable, al igual que los restaurantes y la zona de piscina. ",5,2017,12,10
28,Un hotel perfecto!!!!,"Nosotros estuvimos una noche en el hotel, fuimos con una niña de 3 años. Teníamos una habitacion reservada y nos cambiaron la habitación con vistas a la ciudad. Para la niña tenia todos los detalles, zapatillas para ella, jabones y cremas, es todo un detalle. La habitación muy amplia y con detalle de bienvenida que es de agradecer. El baño super amplio y con todas las comodidades posibles. El personal es muy amable, cenamos en el hotel y comimos muy bien. El desayuno espectacular. Tiene varias piscinas que son enormes, la exterior es impresionante y tiene varias terrazas con unas vistas de la ciudad de Barcelona espectacular. Volveremos seguro. Gracias!!!",5,2017,12,08
28,No es un gran lujo,"Hotel con vistas estupendas de toda la ciudad de Barcelona, siendo espectaculares de noche.
Tiene varias terrazas, piscina interior y exterior, spa donde hacen masajes y tratamientos y restaurante.
Las habitaciones son amplias, con un lavabo lujoso y extrema limpieza.
Sin embargo, el trato del personal y el estado de conservación del edificio, distan mucho de un hotel de 5 estrellas gran lujo. En mi opinión, debería ser un 4 estrellas.
Lo más destacable y sin posibilidad de crítica alguna, LAS VISTAS.",3,2017,12,07

28,Decepción ,"El pasado día 17, reservamos habitación para nuestra noche de bodas, nos pareció un hotel con encanto, para un día tan especial. Llegamos sobre las 00.45h, nos felicitaron y como nos apetecía tomar una copa, nos dirigimos al bar, antes de subir a la habitación, pedí un gin tónic con una de las ginebras que me ofrecieron, la sorpresa me la llevé cuando me trajeron la copa ya preparada, sin enseñarme la botella de ginebra, ni mucho menos me dieron opción a indicar la cantidad de ginebra que deseaba, ni de hielo. Ante mi comentario de cómo lo traían así , me respondió el camarero que siempre lo hacían así sin más, y por mi insistencia y queja de que no me parecía correcto, tratándose de un hotel de su categoría, me retiro la copa con desgana, y me trajo otra con los ingredientes por separado. Es una pena que no se cuiden estos aspectos. Como incidencia pequeña y a título de comentario, en la habitación no tuvimos ningún detalle de recién casados ( Así es como miman a los clientes).......",2,2017,11,20
28,Estancia en Gran Hotel La Florida,"Muy por debajo de nuestras expectativas.
No se puede negar que es un gran Hotel, pero la categoria del mismo (*****GL) y el precio, creo que obliga a ser perfecto, y no lo es ni de lejos.
Sitio precioso con vistas inmejorables.

Los problemas: 
- Poquísimo personal para atención al cliente.
- Muy mala climatización en espacios comunes, hemos estado el 18 y 19 de Noviembre y el frio en ciertas zonas comunes del hotel es inconcebible.
- Los espacios comunes interiores son muy reducidos.

- La piscina SPA: al no estar vigilado en ciertos momentos se convierte en un parque de recreo acuático inaceptable, ruido enorme, toallas por el suelo, poquísimas tumbonas que no invita a quedarse pq al salir del agua te tienes que quedar de pié,
falta de toallas en muchos momentos, la ducha de chorros averiada todo el fin de semana, suelo encharcado constantemente en toda la zona.
- Dormitorio: nos dieron el dormitorio adaptado (minus) sin avisar, no me parece bien
cuando tienes las expectativas de ir a un Hotel de ensueño, y que no se mal entienda, creo que como mínimo hay que avisar.
Teníamos la ventana y terraza encima del parking de la entrada principal, no se podía abrir las cortinas ni por supuesto salir a la terraza pq quedabas completamente a la vista de la entrada principal del hotel como un escaparate.
Lampara de noche rota con la pantalla descolgada, el wc i la ""picaÇ"" atascadas de agua y la ducha perdia agua he inundava todo el baño.
La decoración de la habitación muy pobre rozando el ambiente de tanatorio, y todo un poco ""demodé""

Cosas buenas:
- El restaurante 1925 excelente.
- El  SPA BY L'OCCITANE excelente, nos hicimos una masaje maravilloso, atención perfecta.
- La cama muy bien, muy cómoda, (se hecha en falta carta de almohadas)

TODAS ESTAS OPINIONES SON EN BASE A LA CATEGORÍA DEL HOTEL I LAS EXPECTATIVAS CREADAS QUE SUGIERE EL HOTEL Y SU PRECIO.

28,"Bonita estancia, precioso lugar !","El marco es simplemente único. Marco incomparable, buenas instalaciones y servicio excelente.  TODOSlos empleados son amabilísimos y hacen que la estancia sea aún más agradable. Si se pretende estar lejos de Barcelona pero a 10 minutos en coche, esperfecto.",4,2017,11,02
28,Un panorama imperdibile.,"De destinazioni interessanti nella capitale catalana ce ne sono molte, ma questa è abbastanza inconsueta, posta sulla sommità del Tibidabo, vicina alla famosa chiesa che domina Barcellona. Certo, se il tempo a disposizione per la visita della città è poco, la collocazione non è tra quelle più comode. Ma se siete già stati da queste parti, potreste considerare questa scelta alternativa. Il panorama splendido unito all'ospitalità e al servizio inappuntabili, per non parlare della tranquillità assoluta e del fascino della residenza d'epoca, potrebbero costituire delle ragioni valide.",4,2017,10,21
28,Un poco decepcionante,"Es un hotel bonito, con encanto, tranquilo ideal para pasar unos días de relax. El trato del personal es muy bueno en general, exceptuando la primera noche que habíamos olvidado traer el cargador de móvil, y nos dijeron que no podían ayudarnos. A la mañana siguiente Gisela fue muy amable y mientras desayunábamos nos cargó el teléfono móvil.

Por otro lado, la habitación era amplia, y con buenas vistas a la montaña. Los muebles necesitan renovación y las paredes una mano de pintura. La cama era enorme y muy cómoda. Había poca decoración, y no era muy acogedora, rompía con el estilo del hotel que era muy bonito y acogedor.

Lo peor de la estancia fue el baño de la habitación. A pesar de ser muy amplio y elegante, olía FATAL! Desprendía un olor mugriento a cañerías que hacía bastante desagradable estar en el baño. Lo dijimos en recepción varías veces, y no se solucionó el problema ni recibimos una alternativa.

Respecto al desayuno, está bien pero para el precio que tiene de 20€ es un poco escaso y además por una tortilla al gusto tienes que pagar 5€ extras. Además termina a las 10:30, un poco temprano.

El hotel está alejado del centro, a unos 15-20 minutos en coche por una carretera de montaña. Te ofrecen la opción de un shuttle bus que sale a las 10, a las 12 y a las 16 hasta Plaza Cataluña, pero hay que reservarlo con antelación, cuando llegamos el jueves a las 14 el próximo libre era para el día siguiente a las 16, por tanto de poco nos sirvió.

En resumen, nos esperábamos más de un hotel de esta categoría.",3,2017,10,15
28,Cena en el Restaurante Barcelona del Gran Hotel La Florida,"Excelente MENÚ DEGUSTACIÓN!!!
Un viaje gastronómico complementado con un maridaje perfecto... lleno de poesia.
Gracias Luciano por tu saber hacer como metre y gracias Xenia por introducirnos en el mundo del maridaje con tanta maestría, cada vino....y su historia envolvía mágicamente cada uno de los platos. Ayer fuimos muy felices en el restaurante Barcelonas en el Gran Hotel Florida. El equipo que formáis tiene tanta química que nos hicisteis sentir únicos deleitando cada sabor y cada sorbo...
Recordaremos siempre está cena, deseosos que en un futuro, muy pròximo, podamos disfrutar de nuevo en el Gran Hotel La Florida, de vuestra compañía. Volveremos SEGURO!! GRACIAS!!!

28,NUESTRA BODA TUVO UNA ORGANIZACIÓN PÉSIMA,"El hotel es muy bonito, cierto. La decoración preciosa. Pero mi boda fue un auténtico despropósito. 
En los aperitivos ""olvidaron"" servir un arroz de la Costa Brava con cigalas, que era casi el plato estrella de los aperitivos, que estaba contratado y pagado, obviamente. 
La respuesta de la empresa no puede ser ""había muchos otros aperitivos y la gente no repetía"" No, la gente no quería repetir pero yo sí al menos probar un arroz que contraté.
El setting no lo respetaron según mis indicaciones.
Con los cafés, también olvidaron los ""petits fours"" (también contratado y pagados por adelantado, obviamente)
De los objetos que el hotel me guardó para pasarlos a recoger a la mañana siguiente, extravió unas chucherías que yo compré por un importe de unos 40 euros.
La comida de los niños, infame. Unos macarrones hervidos a los que le echaron un tomate de tetrabrick por encima. Sin gratinar, sin una mala especia.... Y el pollo rebozado duro como una piedra. 
Nada recomendable. Un día tan especial que me dejó con un mal sabor de boca, que no quiero ni oír hablar de ese día...
Que me devolvieran al cabo de 20 días (y varias reclamaciones) el importe del arroz y los petits fours no compensa la mala imagen de ese día ante mis invitados (por cierto, la devolución no alcanzó ni el 5% del importe total de la celebración)
No hay derecho a daños y perjuicios, claro. Pero sí a advertir a otros usuarios que busquen celebrar su boda allí.",2,2017,08,27
28,"Vistas, tranquilidad y calidad","Inmejorable terraza, con unas preciosas vistas de Barcelona, y comida de calidad. El servicio, en general bastante atento, aunque para el nivel del hotel sería un punto a mejorar. Ideal tanto para comer algo más o menos asequible (mínimo a partir de 60€), o ya con un gasto mayor. El hotel es un lugar tranquilo y elegante. Perfecto para ocasiones especiales.",5,2017,08,27
28,Terraza con vistas preciosas ,"La terraza cuenta con preciosas vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona, que se aprecia más en los días claros.

28,Carísimo ,"Nosotros decidimos celebrar nuestro aniversario en el restaurante. Una relación calidad/precio desorbitada. Gazpacho a 15 euros, segundos platos a 30 euros.

",5,2017,08,04
28,"Decepcionante, quiero y no puedo","Lo único recomendable es la oferta del restaurante y el servicio del mismo. Referente al alojamiento deja mucho que desear en relación con la categoria del hotel y precio. No es admisible que tratándose de un regalo para una celebración y siendo residentes de Barcelona te alojen en una habitación sin vistas a la ciudad, te sorprendan con un plegatin que no era necesario, y el servicio de habitaciones y recepción no atiendan la demanda. El pack regalo incluía una copa de cava que en ningún momento fue servida. El coche no lo aparcaron en un garaje, tal como nos indicaron a la llegada.",2,2017,07,30
28,Ideal para una ocasión especial,"Fantástico, increíble, único... qué decir de uno de los mejores GL de Barcelona. Fuimos a celebrar aniversario de pareja y no defraudó en absoluto. Servicio perfecto, piscina interior climatizada, habitaciones espaciosas con un baño perfecto, vistas a la ciudad... Y encima con un precio nada desorbitado en comparación con sus semejantes.

28,Deja mucho que desear para tener cinco estrellas.,"Mi empresa nos llevó de celebración aquí. Puedo decir que tanto el sitio como las vistas perfecto pero el aire acondicionado no lo notábamos en ninguna de las tres salas que estuvimos y era horrible estar ahí. También destacar que la tarima de madera del exterior hay muchas rotas y sueltas, a una compañera y mi se nos metió el pie entre dos ya que se hundió y gracias que no nos hicimos daño pero si que se me estropearon las sandalias.
La comida para ser un hotel de cinco estrellas dejaba mucho que desear (buena presentación pero no calidad) por no hablar del servicio, se quedarían sin postre para todos y contaron el brownie por la mitad, lo comentamos y nos ignoraron.
No voy a generalizar, pero si que tengo que resaltar el mal servicio y los malos modos con el que nos trato y habló  el camarero Anas [--], no es normal que alguien que está cara al público trate de esa manera y hasta con un punto de vacile. En cambio felicitar al camarero Mus por su buen trato, siempre con una sonrisa y teniéndose que hacer cargo de la barra el sólo ya que su ""compañero"" Anas se fue y nos dejó a medio servir por decirle que la copa no estaba buena y es porque ponía soda en vez de tónica en el gin tonic, se fue y no se negó a cambiarlo.",1,2017,07,10
28,"Muy recomendable, excelentes vistas","Fui a cenar con mi pareja la noche de la verbena de San Juan. Las vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona son increíbles. Cena muy correcta: cocina mediterránea de calidad, pero el servicio un poco justo. Supongo que en esas noches de tanta afluencia de clientes deben contratar empleados eventuales que hacen que la rapidez y corrección en el servicio se vea afectada. Quiero pensar que es algo muy puntual. A la hora de marchar nos pidieron un taxi, pero había demora de una hora por ser noche de verbena, el camarero que nos había atendido durante toda la cena se limitó a decirnos que el taxi tardaría una hora y cuando quisimos pedir una copa para entretener la espera nos dijo que a esa hora 01:05 ya no se servían copas. No nos dio alternativa y marchó sin más. Al cabo de un buen rato sin saber nada de nuestro taxi, decidimos nosotros mismos ir a la recepción a indagar, esta vez el recepcionista, muy atento, nos ofreció quedarnos en sus sofás del vestíbulo y nos invitó a una cerveza mientras el taxi llegaba. Qué diferencia de trato con el cliente! Volveré sin duda, pero procuraré que no sea noche de ningún evento tan especial.",4,2017,07,04
28,¡Un acierto!,"No era la primera vez que nos alojábamos en este hotel y, una vez más, no nos defraudó. La situación: si buscas alejarte del bullicio de Barcelona, es la elección perfecta. Vistas impresionantes de toda la ciudad y tranquilidad total. Además, está justo al lado del parque de atracciones del Tibidabo, ¡una combinación ideal!. El hotel: es grande, bonito y elegante. A destacar la zona del Spa y las espectaculares terrazas desde las que puedes disfrutar de una vista increíble mientras te tomas un combinado del bar. La habitación: espaciosa, limpia, bien equipada y con unas vistas privilegiadas. El servicio: es cierto que algunos trabajadores son temporales o hace poco que han llegado, pero todos se desviven por el cliente. La comida: no soy ningún gourmet, por lo que mi opinión no es profesional, pero no tengo ninguna queja al respecto. El precio: estamos hablando de un hotel de lujo y el precio es razonable. Seguro que volveremos.",5,2017,06,27

Qué más se puede pedir? El trato en recepción maravilloso, el restaurante en la piscina genial con una atención muy amable. Si vas, no dejes de visitar el Tibidabo y entrar en el templo......único! y recorrer el parque donde las vistas de la ciudad  son espectaculares, además de poder disfrutar de algunas atracciones si  necesidad de pagar una entrada completa al parque.

28,Un desastre. Nada recomendable.,"Hotel con mucho potencial, unas vistas preciosas y buenas instalaciones. El servicio y el funcionamiento del hotel son un desastre absoluto. La comida mala (pan de hamburguesa duro, pollo seco, mal café, nos pusieron agua caliente en un día súper caluroso a medio día…), son lentísimos para todo, para cobrarte, para traerte la comida, hasta para ponerte un café en barra se tiran más de 15 minutos… Personal nada agradable en general y desorganizado. El wifi funciona muy regular... El desastre alcanza niveles tales que intenté comprar un par de cosas de una tienda de ropa que tienen dentro del hotel y fueron incapaces de cobrarme después de hacerme meter el PIN de mi tarjeta en 3 datáfonos diferentes y de estar 20 minutos esperando a ver si lo conseguían... Desde luego no esperas algo así ni en un tres estrellas, y teniendo en cuenta que te cobran hasta por respirar la sensación de insatisfacción con el servicio del hotel es absoluta, no lo recomiendo nada.",1,2017,06,16
28,No me lo creo!!!!!,"Que quede claro que no pase la noche en el hotel, pero mal comí y peor cene. Casi todo el servicio es extranjero, lo cual no es para mí ningún problema pero empieza a serlo cuando en un hotel de esta categoría no domina el idioma. 
En la comida, una ensalada y un sándwich nos querían cobrar una botella de Moet, increíble. Y la calidad de la comida más que justita.
 En la cena, una ensalada a la que le faltaban ingredientes y que después de comentarlo al metre no hicieron ni caso. Las botellas de aliño es antes vacías, el pan de la hamburguesa de 15€ estaba como una piedra y la carne malísima, las patatas estaban fritas con aceite que no solo era de patata, malísimas.
Menos mal que el postre estaba bueno y las vistas increíbles pero es que no esperas más de un Hotel 5 estrellas gran lujo. ",1,2017,06,15

Desde que llegamos JAVIER nos recibió cómo si estuvieramos en casa, amable y muy educado, después de enseñarlos la habitación fuimos al spa tan maravilloso y tranquilo, puro relax.
Más tarde cenamos menú degustación con maridaje, la sommelier XÉNIA estuvo más que a la altura, yo no soy mucho de vinos y cojí maridaje por mi futura mujer, pero gracias a xénia esa noche disfrute cada vino y espumoso que nos brindó. 
El servicio y amabilidad de Luciano también tengo que recalcarlo, un 10.
Después del gran si, tomamos unos gintonics bueníssimos.
Al día siguiente, despertarse con esas vistas no tiene precio, El buffet de desayunos espectacular, mucha variedad y el servicio de 10.

El desayuno correcto.
La terraza exterior tiene su encanto, junto a un bar y una piscina que nos recibe con unas vistas impresionantes. Merece la pena.

28,"Luxushotel mit spektakulärer Aussicht und erstklassigem Service - ""The leading hotels of the world""","Das geschichtsträchtige Grand Hotel La Florida wurde 1925 erbaut und liegt 300 m über Barcelona, auf dem Berg Tibidabo. Der Blick reicht über die ganze City Barcelonas, das Mittelmeer und die Pyrenäen. Die pulsierende Weltmetropole Barcelona von hier aus zu überblicken ist ein unbeschreibliches Erlebnis; ein besonderer Zauber ist es, das Lichtermeer am Abend zu genießen. 

Viele Berühmtheiten sind in diesem historischen Hotel bereits abgestiegen, wie Penelopé Cruz, Harrison Ford, Ernest Hemingway, James Stewart, Antonio Banderas, die Spieler des FC Barcelona, ...

Wir wurden sehr freundlich und professionell empfangen und fühlten uns hier gleich wohl. Unser Zimmer im 5. Obergeschoss war großzügig und wir hatten einen grandiosen Panoramablick. Klimaanlage, 37'' Flat-TV, kostenloses WLAN, Minibar und Kosmetikartikel von L'occitane sind nur einige der Annehmlichkeiten, die man in diesem Luxushotel vorfindet. Kleine Risse in den alten Gemäuern dürfen Sie nicht stören, das macht den Charme dieses historischen Gebäudes aus. Der Zimmerservice brachte uns jeden Abend ein Fläschen Wasser für die Nacht und stellte uns die Hausschuhe ans Bett. Das Frühstück lies keine Wünsche offen. Wir genossen vorzüglichen Lachs, Schinken, frische Obstspieße, Sekt, Croissants und viele weitere kleine Köstlichkeiten. 

Vom Flughafen Barcelona zum Hotel waren wir mit dem Mietwagen ca. 35 Minuten unterwegs. Das Valetparking im Hotel gehört zum guten Service. In die City von Barcelona fährt man am besten mit dem Shuttlebus oder man stellt das Auto an der Metrostation in Penitentes ab. Von hier fährt die Linie L3 in die City (Haltestelle Catalunya) oder bis zum Hafen (Haltestelle Drassanes). Es sind von Barcelonas Hausberg Tibidabo bis zur Innenstadt ca. 20 - 30 Minuten.

Auf dem Tibidabo, dem höchsten Gipfel der Serra de Collserola steht die Kirche Sagrat Cor. Die Kirche und der Park drumherum laden am Morgen zu einem schönen Spaziergang ein. Vom Hotel aus sind das 2 Gehminuten. Gleich am Morgen kann man hier noch den freien Blick und die Ruhe über der Stadt genießen, bevor die Touristen kommen. 

Wir bedanken uns sehr herzlich für den erstklassigen, freundlichen Service und den angenehmen Aufenthalt im Grand Hotel La Florida.",5,2017,04,21

Völlig daneben, dass zu guter etzt, die ohenhin knappen restlichen Verweilmöglichkeiten auf Grund einer Veranstaltung, umgebaut und weiter eingeschränkt wurden.

No puede ser por casualidad, y parece más probable que la propiedad tenga eso como seña de identidad del hotel. Lo consiguen. Además, muy buena la cocina en el restaurante y estupendo el desayuno. En cuanto a las instalaciones, elegancia y ambiente burgués que te traslada a mediados del siglo XX, y cómodas habitaciones: no muy grandes quizás, pero con todo lo necesario, decoración personal, cama excelente, un buen cuarto de baño con todos los detalles y, sobre todo, absoluta tranquilidad para descansar.

28,Muy buen servicio,"Hoy hemos ido a comer a la terraza del hotel porque nos apetecía comer al aire libre, ya que hacía un día expendido.
Así lo hemos comentado con el portero a la llegada al hotel. 
Una vez en el restaurante nos han orientado para escoger la mesa que tendría sol más rato, nos hemos guiado por sus comentarios y hemos escogido una que creemos ha sido una buena elección. 
La atención al cliente ha sido excelente por parte de Giorgio, quien nos ha atendido durante toda la comida. Es una persona atenta, amable y con buen humor. Además de buen servicio tanto del vino como del resto de platos. Ha tenido el detalle de traer la carta en francés (sin pedírselo) ya que ha notado que uno de nosotros era francés. 
Un buen detalle!  
En el café, hemos ido a la parte interior, ya que hacía viento, el cambio ha sido muy fácil gracias al buen servicio de Antoine (el responsable de sala). 
Al salir, el portero recordaba lo del sol, y nos ha preguntado que si habíamos tenido suficiente. un buen detalle por su parte! 
En general, sólo diría que han tardado un poquito al traer el primer plato, pero las vistas y el buen servicio, lo ha compensado muy bien!! 
Muchas gracias por este buen rato!

28,Gran ruina de nuestra noche de bodas,"Gran hotel la Florida
Gran ruina de nuestra noche de bodas
Habitación fría
Mal servicio
Incumplimiento de los servicios contratados y pagados
Gran incompetencia del personal, y ningún responsable para dar la cara

El 17 de diciembre, decidimos pasar nuestra noche de bodas en el Gran Hotel La Florida.
La experiencia fue la siguiente:
Llegamos a la una de la madrugada del día 18; Al llegar a la habitación, y comprobar el frio que hacía, se lo comunicamos al único empleado que había en recepción del  hotel, que es quien nos acompañó a la habitación, quien efectivamente al comprobar este hecho en el propio termostato, que en aquel momento marcaba menos de 17 grados, nos confirmó que efectivamente el aire acondicionado estaba apagado, indicándonos que procedería desde su ordenador de recepción a programarlo a 26 grados.
Durante una hora y media, estuvimos en la habitación con el abrigo puesto.
Durante dicho periodo, nos volvimos a quejar de la temperatura, incapaces de ducharnos en el baño, que estaba congelado.
Cuando por fin nos dio una “explicación”, esta fue la siguiente:
La temperatura subía 2 grados a la hora, ósea  que con un simple cálculo nos dimos cuenta que la habitación estaría a 22 grados sobre las 4 de la madrugada.
Ya resignados a ello, y puesto que en la habitación no había ni un simple peine para el aseo, pedimos dos cepillos de dientes, que nos fueron entregados 40 minutos después.
No se atendió nuestra reclamación de los servicios contratados y pagados  en el spa, aduciendo que no tenían constancia de la  la reserva
Los dos bonos contratados en el restaurante Barcelona de dicho hotel para la comida del día 18, no se nos atendió,  aduciendo que eran para la cena del día 17. Incomprensible, que contratáramos una cena degustación en dicho hotel a sabiendas que haríamos el chek- in a partir de las 12 de la noche, e incomprensible que no se nos advirtiera del hecho telefónicamente al  hacer la reserva.
El trato de  los tres empleados del día 18 por la mañana, lamentable. Ningún responsable para atender nuestras reclamaciones",1,2016,12,18
28,Lujo y tranquilidad,"Situado en la montaña del Tibidabo le permite tener vistas privilegiadas de la ciudad. Las instalaciones están muy bien cuidadas y con todo lujo de detalles. Es ideal para hacer celebraciones, bodas o reuniones de negocios.",5,2016,12,15
28,El servicio no está a la altura de un hotel de esta categoría ,"Mi pareja y yo llegamos a las 15h. al hotel para realizar el check-in, ya que fue la hora que nos dieron de entrada.
No nos dieron la habitación hasta las 17h., haciéndonos esperar en el bar del hotel. Nos dijeron que el cliente anterior tenía el privilegio de salir más tarde.
Durante la espera, compartimos una botella pequeña de agua, que tuvimos que pagar (a precio de oro).

Para empezar, en un hotel como este, no deberían pasar cosas así. Y, además, me parece una vergüenza que ni siquiera tuvieran el detalle de invitarnos al agua que bebimos mientras esperábamos durante dos horas. 
Me gustaría añadir que me cuesta de entender que a mediados de Octubre todavía no tuvieran en marcha el sistema de calefacción y que tuviéramos que pasar frío.

Es una lástima que hoteles tan impresionantes como lo es el Hotel La Florida, por sus instalaciones, su situación, su prestigio y sus elevados precios, no estén a la altura de lo que se espera de un hotel de esta categoría.

28,Disappointing/ Decepcionante,"Buenos días,

Había estado en el hotel anteriormente, en boda etc y esta vez vine para pasar una noche con mi pareja q venia expresamente de Londres y quería ensenarle Barcelona, en mi opinión,  desde uno de los mejores sitios de Barcelona, tanto por la vistas como por el lujo del hotel.

Ciertamente no fue para nada lo esperado. 

Estuvimos únicamente una noche, de sábado a domingo, y por ser un hotel de estas características esperaba un servicio excelente.

He estado en muchas hoteles de la misma categoría y muchos otros también de otras categorías y creo que se distinguir que esperar según el hotel.

La aventura fue la siguiente:

Llegamos el sábado por la tarde y tuve que esperar 15-20 minutos para hacer el check in. Posteriormente tardaron casi una hora en subir las maletas (con lo que no pudimos disfrutar de la zona de spa por una hora por tener que esperar las maletas). La persona que subió la maleta amablemente se disculpó, pero la hora de espera no la quito nadie. 

Seguidamente llamaron a la habitación para comunicar que la tarjeta que había dado de depósito no funcionaba, y tuve que bajar a recepción. Una vez más, espere 20 minutos hasta que pude ser atendida ya que 'una de las personas de la recepción no se sabía dónde estaba'. Acabe dejando efectivo para el depósito para no perder más tiempo. La persona que atendió en ese momento (no recuerdo el nombre) no fue demasiado amable.. 

Cenamos en el hotel, y por suerte no tengo nada que decir- el servicio fue excelente y uno de los camareros fue muy amable. 

Desayunamos en el hotel y me sorprendió que un camarero en particular no sabía que era un plato de yogur que había elegido. Una vez más, en un hotel de 3 estrellas lo entendería, pero en un hotel gran lujo, esperas que por lo menos los camareros sepan lo que están sirviendo.

Pedimos dos cepillos de dientes y dijeron que los subían a la habitación acto seguido, y el acto seguido se convirtió en 40' que tuve que volver a llamar para recordarles. Se habían olvidado y los subieron acto seguido. 

Para hacer el check out estuve 20' más esperando.

En resumen, el hotel y las instalaciones son magníficas pero el servicio no está a la altura, o al menos no lo estuvo en mi experiencia.
 
Queriamos volver porque justo el domingo no se pudieron ver las vistas por la niebla, y queria llevar a los suegros cuando viniesen a Barcelona, pero despues de esta experiencia no voy a recomendar el hotel. Ni para pasar la noche, ni para bodas ni para nada.

Normalmente no me tomo el tiempo de hablar sobre el mal servicio, pero en mi opinión es inaceptable en un hotel de esta categoría. 

Todo lo que aquí he redactado se lo hice saber a Carla de respuesta a su pregunta sobre cómo había ido la estancia, con lo que su respuesta fue le sabia mal y que no podía hacer nada en ese momento hasta que no hablase con el servicio y que hoy recibiría un email después de que ella hablase con el servicio. No he recibido ningún email.

Decepcionante.
 
 
Un saludo.
 
Atentamente,

Si te planteas taxi (30 euros ir a la ciudad) resígnate a esperar otra media hora mínimo porque el hotel tiene muy mal organizado esto. Deberían de tener un servicio de bus más regular o una parada de taxis allí. Si lo que te planteas es quedarte en el hotel como en un resort, la piscina es pequeña con amacas lejos de la piscina y el SPA nada resaltable. Muchas mejores opciones en Barcelona ciudad. El personal es muy amable pero le falta organización/ dirección. La habitación buena y grande y cama muy cómoda. Si no fuera porque cuesta 300 euros la noche, lo puntuaría como normal. ",2,2016,11,13
28,Objetos personales que desaparecen y personal inepto,"Mi pareja y yo nos alojamos en una Suite Junior y dado el precio esperaríamos por lo menos algún detalle de bienvenida por pequeño que sea, cosa que nos hemos encontrado en otros alojamientos de menor categoría. Al llegar a la habitación mi pareja le preguntó al recepcionista (el cual nos acompañó para mostrarnos el hotel) si tendrían un par de velas que dejarnos, el chico preguntó que de qué tamaño y dijo que lo miraba y nos llamaba. No lo hizo. Volvimos a llamar y nos dijo que lo miraba y nos llamaba; volvió a no hacerlo. De repente entra una camarera en la habitación estando nosotros dentro! Para dejar dos botellas de agua y dos trozos de chocolate? Seguimos sin saber si son los detalles que no tuvimos al llegar o si es una compensación por lo de las velas... en fin.  Un trato en general distante, frío y muy robotizado por parte del personal. 

Salimos del hotel y por la noche me di cuenta de que me había dejado mis gafas, con la funda y el líquido que utilizo para guardar las lentillas en el hotel. Estoy 100% segura de que se quedó allí ya que no me moví de casa en todo el día. Bien, llamo a recepción y me dicen que van a preguntar a objetos perdidos, que ahora me llaman. Pasa un buen rato y siguen sin llamarme (no se cuánto se tarda en preguntar si han encontrado unas gafas) y me dicen que no hay nada, que deja una nota para que me llamen por la mañana cuando hablen con las chicas de la limpieza que estuvieron en la habitación. Tampoco me llama nadie por la mañana, soy yo la que debe volver a llamar y me dicen que las chicas todavia no han llegado, que en 10 minutos entran ( a las 09.00h) y me llaman. Mentira otra vez. Yo estoy trabajando y a la hora del descanso (ya al mediodía) tengo que volver a llamar y me responde un recepcionista MUY MALEDUCADO, llamado Marcelo o Mariano ahora no lo recuerdo bien (tenía acento argentino o uruguayo) el cuál me dice que no hay nada y que si quiero que deje el teléfono para que me avisen si aparecen... 
A lo que yo obviamente pregunto extrañada que; si supuestamente ya han preguntado a TODAS las personas que deben preguntar, y han buscado donde tenían que buscar, ¿por qué de repente iban a aparecer? A esta pregunta, el recepcionista responde, textualmente: Pues si no quieres que te llamemos no te llamamos. No te llamamos entonces si aparecen, no?  Simplemente el tono me parece aberrante y vergonzoso más cuando he trabajado como recepcionista durante bastante tiempo y jamás se me habría ocurrido responder así a un cliente ni mucho menos se me habría permitido hacerlo. 
A toda esta situación hay que sumarle que yo llevaba ya no se cuántas horas con las lentillas puestas dado que no veo absolutamente nada sin ellas o sin gafas y que necesitaba saber YA si mis gafas estaban allí (a pesar de estar 100% segura de que allí se quedaron junto a la funda y el líquido de lentillas) para ir a hacerme unas gafas de urgencia, con su correspondiente demora. 
Siguiendo con la conversación telefónica, yo le pregunto al chico que si no han preguntado ya a TODAS las chicas que limpiaron la habitación y me dice que sólo a las que han entrado durante la mañana… Yo, desconozco cuantas personas entran a limpiar una habitación y con extrañeza le pregunto que si acaso hay muchas chicas limpiando las habitaciones a lo que él responde vacilándome con un: si, muchas.  Así que me estaban diciendo de primeras que NO estaban mis gafas cuando ni siquiera habían preguntado bien… por lo tanto le digo que me diga su nombre (por lo maleducado que ha sido) y que ya llamaré yo por la noche dado que ninguna de las personas que han dicho que me llamarían lo han hecho. Llamo y la respuesta es la misma, que no hay nada y que ya han preguntado a todo el mundo… Ésta vez  hablo con un tal Francesc, nada que ver con el anterior. Éste se muestra educado y pide disculpas pese a no ser culpa suya toda esta situación; la verdad es que lo agradecí mucho en ese momento en el que ya estaba maldiciendo a su hotel y todos sus empleados. 
Total, que pese a estar allí mis gafas no han aparecido, me van mandando como una pelota de un lado a otro entre recepcionistas ineptos, no se comunican entre ellos, no son capaces ni de preguntar y llamar para informarme… Irrespetuosos e ineficaces pero eso sí, a la hora de cobrar ningún problema con el datafono! ¿5 Estrellas Gran Lujo? 
Fue un regalo de mi pareja porque siempre hablábamos de casarnos en el Tibidabo y celebrar la boda en este hotel pero no queremos ni imaginarnos el trato que podrían recibir nuestros invitados! Descartado y no se lo pienso recomendar a nadie, voy a desaconsejarlo expresamente dado que no quiero que nadie pase por la misma mala experiencia que nosotros y encima pagando un riñón por unas simples vistas de la ciudad, porque es lo único que tiene el hotel, las vistas. 
Una vergüenza que se permita que esto ocurra  y sinceramente es imposible que no estuviesen mis gafas allí, pero viendo el descontrol que muestran entre todos sus empleados estoy segura de que no se han molestado lo más mínimo en que pueda recuperarlas.",2,2016,11,08
28,UN ROBO A MANO ARMADA.,"No se os ocurra ir. Nosotras estuvimos este fin de semana pasado porque lo vimos en internet y las vistas eran preciosas. Eso es lo único bueno del hotel. Nada más llegar te retienen de tu cuenta 100 euros por si consumes algo del minibar. Me pareció un detalle horrible. En el desayuno si pides tortilla a la francesa te cobran 5 euros de suplemento. Si pides mantas adicionales para la cama, no solo te dicen que no tienen sino que además te preguntan para qué las quieres cuando a ellos les importa un comino. Nuestra habitación no tenía secador de pelo. El techo de parte de la habitación a punto de caerse. 
Todo lo anterior y encima un personal torpe y sin estilo.",1,2016,10,18
28,Hermoso Hotel,"Excelente hotel ubicado en la cima del Tibidabo, desde donde se puede ver todo Barcelona. El personal es muy atento y amable, las habitaciones son amplias, lo mejor de todo es la terraza del hotel, donde se puede disfrutar de algún coctel o pasabocas y si vas en verano, puedes tomar el sol. La comida del restaurante es deliciosa.",5,2016,10,14
28,Was für eine Aussicht ! Segen und Fluch des Standorts,"Das Hotel hätte eine ""Ausgezeichnet"" verdient wenn es zentraler liegen würde , es liegt oben auf dem Berg , die Aussicht auf Barcelona ist genial. In die Stadtmitte braucht man je nach Verkehr 45-60 Minuten. 
Das Personal ist sehr professionel und freundlich, die Zimmer und das Bad geräuming gut ausgestattet und sauber.",4,2016,10,13
28,Amazing!,"Hotel stupendo! Sono stato per lavoro in questo hotel per circa 3 giorni ed oltre alla bellezza della location ( meravigliosa vista dalla camera e dalle terrazze comuni su barcellona) ho apprezzato la camera molto ampia e ben fornita ed il personale in reception cortese,gentile e rapido.
L hotel possiede una piscina ed un idromassaggio riscaldato semplicemente stupendi! Gli unici difetti che ho riscontrato sono la ""approssimativa ""pulizia delle camere con riferimento solo ad  alcuni particolari ( ho visto di meglio in altri 5 stelle), ed il servizio a colazione e cena un pó confuso.
L hotel é abbastanza distante dal centro,e fornisce un servizio di navetta molto comodo ma non molto utile, considerando che la prima corsa é alle 10 e l ultima alle 1630; pertanto bisogna utilizzare il taxi.
Nonostante la forte distanza dal centro (20 -30min in taxi circa) consiglio l hotel e ci ritorneró di sicuro!",5,2016,10,09
28,""" Muchas Gracias ""","Después de un fin de semana con varias incidencias , tuvimos la suerte de contar con la atención personal  y la profesionalidad de su Directora , la Sra. Cristina Roures. Gracias a ella , el hotel La Florida , se puede llamar Gran Hotel.

28," restaurante mejorable"," solo puedo opinar de restaurante tipo Bistro que tiene este gran hotel. Me da pena cuando te ponen un jamón bastante crudo en un plato pequeño y todo amontonado pero que te cobran como si fuese un jamón perfectamente curado y bien presentado. ",3,2016,10,04
28,"Aniversario estropeado, decepcionante estancia","Antes que nada, me gustaría decir que escribo esta opinión con ánimo de que el hotel mejore ya que se trata de un lugar emblemático para la ciudad (a mi parecer), aunque nuestro aniversario se vio estropeado por la decepcionante estancia y no lo recomiendo nada de nada por ahora, especialmente si esperáis algo romántico en pareja.

Recepción y Hall:
Como no llegamos en Mercedes y pregunte por el aparcamiento el botones me soltó un ""a que vienen?"" que nos dejo estupefactos. Tratándose de un hotel no voy a venir para ver una película. Una pregunta de ""Dispone de reserva"" habría sido más educada y acertada para un 5*GL. Supongo que por eso ni tan solo nos ofrecieron algo de beber en la recepción.
Nada más entrar ya podemos observar un grave defecto de mantenimiento en la pintura de las paredes. Una zona afectada de alrededor de un metro desconchada o con una humedad sin reparar. Por lo demás, unos espacios muy bonitos y amplios que hacen sentir que estas en un sitio especial, quizá pondría algo más de iluminación ya que es muy tenue.

La habitación supuestamente ""DeLuxe"":
Entendemos que no tienen obligación de cumplir las peticiones, aunque deberían intentarlo con alguna. Sobre pedir habitación en planta alta, con vistas a la ciudad nos asignan planta 1 (porque en planta 0 no hay) y ""vistas"" montaña que comentare luego. Por lo que comentan está lleno por un evento y no han podido hacer más.
Nada más subir lo primero que sorprende es que la habitación queda ""apartada"" del resto. El carrito de ropa sucia en la puerta no es nada lujoso y las constantes entradas y salidas de la sala de servicio adjunta molestan enormemente.
Al acceder comprobamos con decepción que las supuestas vistas no son más que una vista perfecta a los carros de ropa sucia de la lavandería inmediatamente debajo de la ventana, tapados deficientemente por un toldo, y una absoluta falta de intimidad ya que desde la única ventana podíamos ver cómo tanto ciclistas y transeúntes te saludan desde fuera, algo que nos obligo a pasar la cortina y quedarnos con una habitación ""interior"".
El baño es muy bonito y la zona de ducha amplia y nos gusto mucho. Aun así, el alicatado había sido reparado con muy poca gracia ya que restos de borada se ven perfectamente desde el inodoro.
Las amenities si que son de Occitane pero insuficientes, un único sobre con 2 bastoncillos de orejas y ni cepillo de dientes ni cuchilla de afeitar.
La televisión es complicada, sin menú de hotel y sin canales de pago.
Lo que sí está muy surtido es el minibar, pero con unos precios que si son de 6 estrellas. Una lástima que el resto no esté a la altura.

Esta habitación en concreto (115) no deberían ofertarla y menos a parejas, quizá para compartir y con camas separadas podría tener futuro.

La zona de aguas:
La piscina es espectacular y aquí si que no puedo decir más que: Impresionante. Supero con creces nuestras expectativas, aunque lo que no me gusto es que es la zona de paso a la terraza y se pierde mucha intimidad, algo que se agradece cuando estás en traje de baño.
Indicaciones escasas sobre el equipamiento adicional, la mitad de duchas y duchas de chorros fuera de servicio, y lo más decepcionante de todo: la sauna por debajo de 50 grados, según me comentaron en recepción se apaga automáticamente si no se usa en un rato... Imperdonable.
Ya nos defraudo en gran medida que no avisaran que la sauna no es mixta y que hombres y mujeres deben acceder por su lavabo (llame para informarme previamente), lo que imposibilita compartir este momento en pareja.
Tampoco encontramos hammam o baño de vapor (ni mixto ni separado). Deberían plantearse bien disponer de este equipamiento y que sea mixto, ya que en cualquier otro hotel con SPA disponen.

El servicio.
Llegados a este punto me gustaría comentar el servicio de recepción y botones.
Tras trasmitir mis quejas al equipo lo único que pueden decirme es que existe un evento y que no pueden hacer nada al respecto ya que están completos. Me parece fantástico que realicen eventos y tengan una ocupación del 100% (o si me apuran hasta superior), pero no creo que deba pagar mi reserva por un acto ajeno.
No veo nada oportuno que me pregunten si mi reserva viene de agencia o directamente desde su WEB; acaso no tengo los mismos privilegios y no he pagado mi estancia igual? Entiendo que reservando directamente sus ganancias sean superiores, pero el servicio que recibe un huésped debe ser el mismo, en otro caso no oferten con agencias.

El Desayuno continental:
Otra gran decepción de un punto fuerte que los huéspedes esperan con entusiasmo.

Tazas de zara home desportilladas, escasa variedad y poca cantidad en la mayoría de las bandejas son los causantes de la gran decepción, por no hablar del frio que hacía, algo que supongo es para disuadir de quedarse mucho rato.
Nada especial en el surtido respecto a cualquier desayuno continental de cualquier hotel con la mitad de estrellas. 
Ni un solo ejemplar de prensa internacional o deportiva.

De abuso cobrar un suplemento de 5€ por unos huevos Benedict después de pagar el desayuno continental que no es nada barato.",2,2016,10,03
28,La Florida de tu vida,"Habia escuchado hablar del hotel en varias ocasions y esta vez decidi probar. El lugar no puede ser mas bonito, unas vistas que quitan el hipo desde un palacio en la cumbre de Tibidabo. La bienvenida fue tremendamente acogedora, tanto el coserje como la recepcionista fueron extremadamente amables conmigo. En general todo el personal destaca por su simpatia. Me hicieron sentir como en casa. 
En mi segundo desayuno, la camarera me llamo por mi nombre y recordaba que tomo cafe ameriano.
En la tienda de complementos la dependienta, encantadora, me ayudo mucho a comprar regalos de ultima hora. 
Solo cene un dia en el hotel, reserve una mesa en la terraza y como ya hace algo de frio por la noche, tuvieron la pevisión de guardar una mesa en el interior por si acaso. 
Por ultimo agracecer también a la mujer de la limpieza que, ademas de dejar la habitación impecable, me dejo unas chocolatinas de chocolate blanco ya que le comente que era mi favorito.
Gracias por todos estos detalles, habeis hecho de mi estancia un verdadero placer.
Volvere pronto!",5,2016,10,01
28,""" un GRAN LUJO "" corto""","un GRAN regalo de cumpleaños de parte de nuestro hijo y su pareja del cual disfrutamos y del que nosotros en su día hicimos disfrutar a otros.un sitio único con una vista privilegiada.
porque lo de GRAN LUJO un poco ""corto"" en nuestra opinión pues porque creemos que como en otros hoteles que hemos estado y que incluso no son de 5* faltaban detalles.por ejemplo una botella de agua de cortesía en la habitación, maquinilla de afeitar en el lavabo,maquina de café e infusiones o incluso una copa de cava en la recepción ( cosa que en otros hoteles nos han ofrecido) otra cosa es una toalla adicional por la noche.
habíamos pedido una habitación con terraza y vistas a la ciudad y al mar nos dieron la 105, amplia y con un gran baño una terraza grande y las vistas espectaculares ( otro pero, el muro que separan las terrazas tendría que llegar hasta el final pues mas de uno mira para dentro de la habitación del vecino ).
por la noche cuando llegamos nos encontramos un detalle un trozo de pastel. al día siguiente nos quedamos un rato para seguir disfrutando de las vistas y la piscina, una gozada.
el personal excelente.",4,2016,09,25

Pero haciendo una pequeña descripción del hotel, deciros que es una maravilla. Un espacio elegante, con muchos detalles preciosos y seleccionados con cuidado. Dispone de unos patios que invitan a relajarse tiene unas zonas de relax de primera.
Entrando al tema de la terraza, para mí es una de las mejores de Barcelona tanto en vistas como en diseño. Un lugar para tomar algo con amigos o pareja, donde aciertas siempre. 
Las consumiciones no son excesivamente caras. Y se puede disfrutar de un baño en la piscina. 
El personal muy discreto y correcto.

Si mas allá de la habitación tengo que recomendar algo es su restaurante, es caro, claro, pero una vez estas allí arriba merece la pena, como sugerencia pedir los nachos con guacamole, no tienen desperdicio. 
La piscina interior-exterior esta genial y para poderse uno bañar en pleno febrero a nosotros nos vino de perlas.",5,2016,07,30
28,Gran decepción ,"Estuve en una reunión de empresa en este hotel. La elegimos por su ubicación y por la fama que tiene. Lamentablemente me defraudó. Problemas con el aire acondicionado (tuvimos que pedir hasta en 5 ocasiones que lo regulasen bien), servicio de restaurante muy lento, pérdida de llaves del coche por parte del servicio de aparca coches y un sinfín de pequeños detalles que denotan que no es, ni de lejos, un 5* GL. La impresión es que hay un problema en la gestión o han habido cambios en la misma, porque el personal no tiene ni la experiencia, ni el perfil que cabría esperar.

En Barcelona hay otros hoteles que tienen realmente está categoría",2,2016,07,24
28,Noche en pareja ,"Elegimos este hotel por la cercanía con el observatorio Fabra y la verdad nos encantó, aunque claro tratándose de un 5 estrellas así tenía que ser.

28,No hace falta pagar el precio de la habitación con un café también disfrutas de la vista,"Me gustan los hoteles de 5 estrellas GL, por este motivo un amigo me recomendó que fuera, y nos lo regalamos como escapada por Sant Valentin. Cogí una suite, cena en el restaurante, later check out, masaje, parquing, en fin prepare una salida especial.
Al llegar, la recepción, que intentan que sea muy personalizada con copa de cava ya fue un poco desastre, puesto que había una pareja quejándose. Nos llevaron a la habitación y la vista es espectacular, realmente cada momento es diferente el sol hace que Barcelona cambie y se muestre espectacular. 
Quisimos  tomar  un café, fuimos al bar, y nos dijeron que estaba cerrado, preguntamos por que y fueron a preguntar, al rato nos dijeron que al ser sant Valentin estaban preparando la sala para una fiesta, que si lo deseábamos nos daban una manta y podíamos tomar el café en la terraza, con las vistas geniales. Así lo hicimos, al terminar pasamos por recepción solicitamos que nos dirán cepillos de dientes y un peine, puesto que de amities solo había jabón y poca cosa más.
Cojimos y nos fuimos al spa, Nada  recomendable, niños, ruido, parecía la calle central, el spa, esta conectado con el bar exterior y de hecho la piscina enlaza con el exterior, al igual que la puerta que niño tras niño dejaban abierta, así que como lo que queríamos era relajarnos, optamos por marcharnos.
Al llegar a la habitación, comprobamos que el cepillo de dientes aun no estaba y la verdad es que pusimos buena voluntad, os ahorrare el resto.
Mucha gente descoordinada, la sensación es que estaban desbordados en todo momento, una lastima.
Volveré, pero a tomar café. Un hotel de su categoría no puede permitirse tal descontrol, cuando me mandaron el formulario lo escribí y lo envié. Para los posibles huéspedes soló comentar que en otros hoteles de Barcelona de la misma categori me han atendido mucho mejor.",3,2016,06,23

28,Un hotel único que tiene que mejorar algunas cosas,"Nos alojamos en nuestro primer aniversario de boda - conmemorando que la noche de boda que habíamos pasado en este mismo hotel - y reservamos para ello una habitación con terraza individual y vistas al mar. Tumbarse en esa terraza, con esas vistas es una gozada. El servicio puede mejorar; avisamos de que llegaríamos sobre las 13h (volábamos desde Madrid) pero no nos dieron la habitación hasta las 15h. Para colmo, cuando fuimos a pedir la habitación a las 15h nos dijeron que la habitación estaría ""a partir de las 15h"" lo cual no es muy de recibo en un hotel 5* gran lujo (la reserva la hicimos directamente en el hotel, sin promociones ni descuentos). Tras otro par de incidentes relacionados con la atención y quejarnos en la recepción del trato recibido nos pidieron disculpas y nos invitaron a una botella de cava e hicimos las paces. Eso sí, por la noche no pudimos cenar en el restaurante del hotel porque estaba completo... no podrían avisarte al hacer la reserva de la habitación o el check-in de que reserves en el restaurante si quieres cenar?

28,"Bonitas vistas, pero con MAL SERVICIO","Mi marido y yo con mi hijo de tres años, nos alojamos dos noches en el hotel para pasar un fin de semana en Barcelona. Durante la estancia, todo era correcto. 

En el mismo día que hicimos el check_out, nos dimos cuenta de que habiamos olvidado la manta del niño en la habitación del hotel. Enseguida llamé al hotel para preguntárselo. Me dijo el chico del hotel que iba a hablar con la empresa de limpieza el día siguiente y me llamaría para darme la respuesta. 

Al día siguiente, por la tarde, sin ninguna llamada de hotel, llamé yo otra vez al hotel. La señorita CARLA me cogió el teléfono. Después de que le conté la historia de la manta, CARLA con una actitud tan negativa me dijo que no sabía nada aún de la manta. Le comenté que había hablado la noche anterior con su compañero y que me iba a dar la respuesta. Aquí ella enseguida me dijo que su compañero había llamado a la empresa de la limpieza pero le dijeron que no había nada en la habitación... Todo el rato, CARLA se limitaba en hablar, muchas veces su explicación era un NO solo, sin mostrar interés de solucionarme el problema. De mi parte, insistía yo que la manta estaba en la habitación seguro y le repetía varias veces, al final, me dijo que iba a hablar con la empresa de limpieza y me contestaría pero sin saber cuándo... 

Más tarde, llamé al hotel otra vez para saber si la señorita CARLA había hablado con la empresa de limpieza o no, y me dijo su compañero que la llamaría YO en cinco minutos más tarde, que ella estaba hablando por teléfono. En este caso, debería ser ella o alguien de su hotel, quien me llamaría en cinco minutos, no YO... además, tiene mi número de teléfono en la mano.... Aquí otra vez muy desesperado por la profesionalidad de su personal!

Nueve minutos después, llamé al hotel otra vez, era CARLA quien me cogió el teléfono y otra vez me dijo que no estaba la manta en la habitación después de haber hablado con la empresa de limpieza... seguía con su actitud negativa, como si fuese yo quien la estaba molestando!!! Era una sensación increíble de hablar con esta chica!!! No pude aguantarla ni un minuto más y le pedí que me pasara con su jefe, que era señor Cesar, quien me encontró la manta enseguida, que estaba en el hotel la manta...

Non avvicinatevi nemmeno!!! Spendete troppo e mangiate nulla! La responsabile del ristorante ha evidenti antipatie per gli italiani... 
Non lo consiglio !!",2,2016,05,23
28,"""Un lugar especial......con sorpresa""","Es un lugar especial con unas vistas de la ciudad espectaculares . el hotel tiene un aspecto muy cuidado y podríamos clasificarlo como boutique . Tiene un spa del que no pudimos disfrutar con un aspecto genial . La habitación que nos dieron en el primer piso era algo ruidosa ( se oía la música del bar que paró a las 21h )y además se oían los gritos de la gente que estaba en el parque de atracciones ; las camas eran cómodas . El aire acondicionado de la habitación no había manera de pararlo y lo conseguí encontrando y apagando el conmutador que le correspondía . La mala experiencia fue que nos abrieran la habitación a las doce y media de la noche otros huéspedes con la llave en la mano diciendo que teníamos un problema ; a parte del susto , es inaceptable que esto suceda en un Hotel que pretende ser referente . Las disculpas fueron inmediatas y una botella de cava en la habitación fue el pequeño detalle con el que pretendían que desapareciera el malestar que nos crearon . En fin una experiencia agridulce .",3,2016,05,18

28,Gran lujo con grandes errores,"Atención. Este hotel está compitiendo en una liga (Arts, W, Claris,...) que le obliga a ser perfecto. Mi crítica va en este sentido.

El hotel tiene, a día de hoy,necesidad inmediata de obras de mejora que un mantenimiento (bastante recortado, por cierto) no puede suplantar. 

En habitaciones: 1. Maravillosos ventanales exteriores de madera que no cierran hermeticamente y con falta de mantenimiento exterior (aceitar, barnizar, ...); 2. Platos de ducha con piezas rotas; 3. Mando de gobierno de la climatización inutilizado. 

En spa: 1. Zona húmeda (hamman) inutilizado con puerta rota 2. Duchas con mandos que se caen. 3. Sauna con cuadro de sonido sin tapa 4. En zona jacuzzi, un pilar en el que aparece un cable eléctrico a techo. 5. La mayoría de máquinas de gimnasio están en las piscina (con la humedad que hay allí), salvo las cintas de correr que están en una sala anexa que se accede desde la propia piscina lo que aprovechan los niños mojados para jugar en ellas.

En exterior: 1. La cubierta sobre la piscina tiene piezas rotas o faltan piezas (en zona entre lucernarios que dan a piscina). 2. Fisuras en revoco de pared sobre ventanal piscina. 3. Mobiliario echo de palets astillados y podridos.

Pero lo peor ha sido una consideración de principio arquitectónico. Me refiero a las comunicaciones interiores en el hotel. Mi experiencia nace de la complicación que le ha resultado al hotel el que se celebre a la vez una boda en el interior y un aperitivo en el exterior. Esto fue anoche.

1. No puede ser que permitan que los platos de comida que llevan los camareros al mejor restaurante del hotel circulen por el lobby. No puede ser que el lobby se llene de olor a comida.
2. No puede ser que los invitados al aperitivo exterior, para no pasar por el salón donde estaban celebrando la boda, pasaran por la piscina. Por allí pasaron todos, incluso un perro!!! y no uno cualquiera: un bulldog!!. Los clientes que estabamos en el jacuzzi, o en la piscina, no entendíamos nada. Por donde nosotros teníamos que ir descalzos, pasaba la gente arreglada con zapatos de calle. Dejaban la corredera al exterior abierta y entraba una corriente de frio insoportable. 

En definitiva: este hotel ha de ser glamour, ha de ser calidad, ha de ser exclusividad. Quiero mi anterior hotel. Este no me gusta. Me lo han cambiado.",2,2016,05,08
28,Hotel 10,"Estuvimos celebrando nuestro primer aniversario de boda. Desde la primera toma de contacto te hacen sentir especial.

Estuvimos en una habitación con terraza en primera planta, no hay que decir que las vistas eran espectaculares y más en una de estas habitaciones. El restaurante perfecto en calidad precio, cogimos menú degustación y cada plato es una sorpresa. Recomiendo este hotel 100%, para cualquier ocasión, nosotros fuimos en pareja pero habían familias con niños que al tener el tibidabo al lado es comodisimo.

28,Gran Hotel con grandes pegas,"La construcción en lo alto de la montaña y el emplazamiento son fantásticos. Si buscamos relax y estar incomunicados sin duda lo recomiendo.

Ahora bien, más os vale llevaros comida. El restaurante es muy caro y tampoco nada del otro mundo. Desayunar es caro.

Dada la ubicación taxis para todo. Y encima no deis con el botones que no tiene ni idea y me tuvo 40 minutos esperando cuando había taxis disponibles que pensé eran para otros huéspedes. Llegué tarde a mi reunión.

El gimnasio inexistente. 3 máquinas y 1 rota, ni una sola pesa. Eso sí bicicleta y cinta de correr que no falten pero algunos queremos hacer pesas.

La piscina impresionante, pero no se por que razón los del bar exterior tenían la puerta abierta al exterior por lo que la temperatura en cierta zona era fría, fastidiando la experiencia.

Para un hotel de 5 estrellas flojo en servicios. La habitación sin embargo buena.",3,2016,04,30
28,Un Gran Lujo,"Gran Hotel, con las mejores vistas de Barcelona, 5 estrellas Gran Lujo, recordemos que de ésta con ésta categoría no hay muchos en toda España. Tranquilidad y relax máximo. Atención impecable, quizá demasiada gente extranjera atendiendo, somos conocedores de su proyección internacional, pero es una observación que no pasa por  alto en un país donde la falta de empleo es crítica.  Muy buenas instalaciones con amplias habitaciones y lujosas, provistas de casi todo lo  en un cesario en en G.L. Sólo encontramos a faltar el peine, cepillo de dientes desechable y abrillantador de zapatos.  Cama kingsize, cojineria y ropa de cama a la línea de su categoría. Todas las toallas  que hacen falta y más. La llave a la antigua usanza, con su depósito a la conserjería, que ya no existe como tal, otra moda estandarizada actualmente. Todo muy correcto.
En cuanto al bufett de desayuno, sería su punto más débil, siempre desde la perspectiva de su categoría máxima, bastante justito, encontramos a faltar surtido de panes y panecillos. Tostadora poco práctica, a la que te descuidas te quemas, recomendaríamos una con rodillo de entrada y salida. Estas críticas son con ánimo de no ofender y nos las tomaremos como constructivas.

Padezco de Cáncer incurable (eso dicen los médicos, aunque yo no me lo creo ;) y en una semana de diagnóstico duro decidí ir con mi sobrinita y mi perrita (previo pago de 50€ por ella) a pasar una noche y olvidarme de todo durante al menos un día... La semana había sido dura, recibir un mal diagnóstico que no te esperas me desestabilizó un ""poquito"" y durante la semana hice muchas compras, ropita, restaurantes... Y cuál fue mi sorpresa al hacer el check out? Me habían bloqueado las tarjetas por seguridad, por compras irregulares. Llegados a este punto y habiendo de marchar a una visita médica inminente, propuse pagar mediante transferencia. Banc Sabadell (el mío) a Banc Sabadell (el del hotel) es decir, entrada inmediata del importe. El trato fue bochornoso. Absolutamente cruel. Me exigían que fuera a sacar efectivo (mientras mi sobrinita se quedaba allí de aval) o que no me podía ir... 😳 ... Increíble, absolutamente fuera de lugar. No volvería ni gratis. El peor trato y el rato más bochornoso que he pasado en la vida.

Yo siempre tengo problemas para dormir en cama que no sea mia y aqui puedo decir que descanse. El baño es impresionante, sobre todo la ducha, grande y súper cómoda. Los detalles del baño de l' occitane de provença, en el mismo hotel hay una tienda donde adquirirlos si lo deseamos. El spa no es que sea una maravilla, pero para relajarte un poco no esta mal. El desayuno muy bien, y el café con leche al fin en una taza como dios manda, grande,👏. Lo que no me gusto fue que a la entrada te obsequian con una copa de cava, pero si no te gusta no te dan opción a otra cosa. En general es perfecto para parejas y para relajarte.",5,2016,02,21
28,Las vistas y la decoración- lo mejor!!,"Mi pareja me regaló una noche en el hotel para el San Valentín, ha elegido un pack muy completo que era late check out, cava con fresas en la habitación y un masaje en el SPA. 
Admiraciones por la elección de ambientador del hotel!!
Tuvimos la suite 302 que tiene vistas a montaña y ciudad, es impresionante tomarte el café con esta vista impactante de Barcelona.
Hemos tenido  una recibida impecable con mucha atención del conserje y la recepcionista, que nos enseñó las instalaciones del hotel y nuestra habitación.

Decidimos ir a comer en la terraza a disfrutar al sol y era el único que pudimos hacer. Más de media hora no nos atendieron. A los primeros 10 minutos nadie salió a vigilar su rango,decidí ir a la barra para coger una carta y el camarero no me dejó pedir la bebida con la excusa que ya vendrá su compañero a atendernos. Me fié de sus palabras y volví con la carta a la mesa. Salió un camarero, me vio con la carta abierta y mi mirada hacia él, pero no reaccionó de ninguna manera. 

Lo peor era,que bastante después que nosotros se sentaron otra gente y han sido atendidos directamente trayéndoles la carta y unas mantas.Hemos esperado un poco más, pero ya el hambre apretó y tuvimos que entrar dentro para que alguien nos hiciera caso. 
Allí el servicio también era un poco lento, la ensalada César no era nada fresca, por la noche la repetimos y era mucho mejor. Las bravas que eran 6, las trajeron frías..El postre era impresionante! A todo eso el personal era muy amable.

A la cena era todo correcto, pero faltaba un poco de ambiente en la sala como unas velitas y música un poquito más fuerte, se podía escuchar el ruido de los cubiertos.

En el informe para el cliente ponía que el desayuno es hasta las 11h, bajamos a las 10.35h y los camareros nos dijeron que es hasta las 10.30h, nos dejaron entrar porque lo teníamos incluido. No se si nos confundimos nosotros al leer o hay un mal entendido.

Después del desayuno hicimos el masaje en el Spa, nos atendieron super bien y salimos muy contentos.

El hotel es precioso, pero para mi el servicio del restaurante no está en la altura y es muy mejorable!",3,2016,02,16
28,Kleinod mit spektakulärem Blick,"Das Gran Hotel La Florida liegt auf dem Berg Tipidabo über Barcelona. Hier hat man 24 Stunden einen fantastischem Blick über die Stadt. Nachts ein echtes Lichtermeer. 
Das Hotel hat eine eigene Atmosphäre und mit dem Taxi (oder dem Bus, der direkt vor dem Hotel hält) ist man in 10-15Minuten im Zentrum von Barcelona. An den Wochenenden nehmen sich die  Barcelonès hier ihre Auszeit und flüchten vor der Hitze des Kessels in die frische Brise. Reservierungen für das WE sind entsprechend frühzeitig notwendig. Das Personal ist sehr nett aber hin und wieder überfordert. (Wenn man einmal ein tolles Zimmer gefunden hat, unbedingt Zimmer-Nr. merken, denn selbst wenn man von außen auf den entsprechenden Balkon zeigt, weiß das Personal oft nicht wie die Zimmer-Nr. lautet. Bei Emails mit Zimmerwunsch unbedingt hinterher telefonieren und um Bestätigungsemail bitten.)",5,2016,02,15
28,Espectacular!,"Si quieres visitar Barcelona y después de una jornada dura de turismo estar en un hotel maravilloso, con unas vistas increíbles de la ciudad, con un muy buen restaurante para cenar y con una habitación preciosa, esta es la mejor opción.

Les recomiendo muy mucho este hotel. Es una maravilla.",5,2016,02,13
28,Decepción,"Después de 6 años, mi mujer y yo pudimos y decidimos hacer una escapada romàntica. El objectivo era encontrar un Hotel en Barcelona con servicio de masaje y Spa. La agència de viajes nos ofreció 5 opciones, y por desgràcia elegimos la peor, Hotel La Florida.. Nos confirmaron una sesión de masaje a las 18.00h y al llegar nos comunicaron, que no nos podian ofrecer este servicio y no les quedaban más horas disponibles para este dia. Ni nos contactaron ni avisaron con anterioridad.. La decepción fué enorme!! Tiraron por los suelos nuestra ilusión, nuestro objetivo y la escapada que tanto nos costó realizar. Se me ocurren muchas formas de subsanar la desafortunada situación que nos crearon, pero la dirección del Hotel no estuvo a la altura y menos haciéndose llamar Gran hotel, de 5 estrellas y Gran Lujo.. Que para mi, le sobra una estrella y el título de Gran Lujo.. 
Después del mazazo, decidímos ir a lo que ellos llaman Spa, y duramos 2 minutos por el Frio que hacia y porqué no es ni Spa. Si, hay una piscina, pero el jacuzzi es muy pequeño y la sauna minúscula. 
La situación del hotel, es fatal.. Se tardan entre 25-30 minutos para llegar a Barcelona, no es nada practico. Yo no pagué el parking, pero quisiera advertir a otros viajeros que si por mala suerte tienen que alojarse ahí, deberan pagar 21€ al dia! 
Nos cobraron 4,95€ de tasa turística por pareja, otros hoteles de Barcelona cobran 1€ por persona.. 
Me he hospedado en mejores habitaciones que la de este hotel por la mitad de precio, y la bañera es muy pequeña. 
En fin, un desastre!",1,2016,02,10
28,Demasiado frío y demasiadas estrellas,"Mi mujer me preparo un fin de semana sorpresa en este hotel, y la sorpresa fue el enorme frío que pasamos.
No es de recibo que un hotel 5 estrellas no tenga un sistema adecuado para mantener las habitaciones a una temperatura adecuada. La temperatura de la habitación a duras penas llegaba a los 20 grados. Tampoco es de recibo la respuesta del personal, se trata de una suite muy grande y por eso le cuesta calentarse, pues monten un sistema adecuado!
Creo que deberían prohibirse en los hoteles de esta categoría los sistemas centralizados donde el hotel te controla la temperatura (ya he tenido malas experiencias en varios). En un hotel de lujo si un huésped quiere estar 15 grados y otro a 30 están en su perfecto derecho, para eso pagas.
Una lastima que lo que iba a ser un fin de semana memorable, haya quedado en un resfriado y empañe el recuerdo de una buena cena en el restaurante del hotel.",2,2016,02,07

NO NOS GUSTÓ:
-El agua fría de la piscina (climatizada???)
-Baño sucio al llegar a la habitación
-Detalles de falta de mantenimiento (manetas de puerta sueltas, mosquitos aplastados en la pared sin limpiar, paredes con manchas, cortinas que no han sido repuestas)
-Instalaciones del Spa en obras.
-La luz del espejo y un armario, se quedan siempre encendidas día y noche.
-Parking de pago (21€ dia)
-Desayuno 28€
-Las cortinas dejan pasar algo de luz, por lo que la habitación no queda 100x100 oscura.
-El sistema de AC/Calefacción no es nada funcional.
-Los precios del minibar y room service son excesivos!
-Había un olor desagradable de tuberías en el baño.
-El teléfono de la habitación ha sonado 3 veces por la mañana sin ningún motivo.
-Tener que pedir el welcome water pack para la habitación
-Se echa en falta un surtido de café y té, con máquina para calentar agua al menos.
-La pobre conexión de wifi en algunas áreas, especialmente en habitaciones en plantas superiores.
-Que para acceder a la terraza exterior, todo el mundo tiene que pasar por la piscina interior (incluso los que no son clientes, dándote así una sensación de inseguridad y timidez al verte en bañador).",3,2016,01,21

Il personale della reception gentilissimo e sempre disponibile ad esaudire ogni richiesta tempestivamente. Piscina e idromassaggio fantastici (con acqua calda). Da consigliare sicuramente.",5,2015,11,16
28,Muy confortable,"Un agrado visitar Barcelona y quedarse en este hotel, sin perder de vista el hecho de que está a veinte minutos del centro: el hotel ofrece un Shuttle tres veces al día o se puede tomar un taxi (25 euros más o menos), ya que encontrar aparcamiento en la ciudad es una utopía. Nuestra habitación era amplia, muy limpia y ofrecía las comodidades esperadas, y si algo faltaba bastaba una llamada para que el personal, atento desde la recepción hasta las señoras del aseo, respondiera con prontitud y eficacia. El desayuno Buffet es delicioso y muy variado, el Spa y la piscina agradables, quizás sería buena idea poner un limite de horario para niños y así ofrecer tranquilidad a partir de cierta hora.

Sus habitaciones son amplias y completísimas. El hotel dispone tambien de un SPA, con una piscina metálica que sale al exterior. El desayuno excelente y si tienes tiempo antes de dejar la habitación a las 12, puedes hacer un último uso del SPA. Para desconectar, disfrutarlo bien acompañado y volver.",5,2015,10,27

Eso sí barato no és, pero por el sitio que estás, las vistas que ofrece, y la profesionalidad del personal lo vale. Por cierto si teneis la oportunidad de daros un masaje, no lo dudeis.",5,2015,10,14
28,Einmalige Lage und viel Komfort,"Wenn man das Hotel einmal gefunden hat, und ein Eckzimmer gebucht hat, dann gibt's Luxus pur; die Aussicht phänomenal; die Lage, die Ruhe;

Una muy excelente experiencia, una noche en un hotel especial y una degustacion y un maridaje de vinos que resulto ser un perfecto viaje para nuestros sentidos.

Muchas Gracias por la experiencia!

Situato un pó fuori Barcellona, ma comunque raggiungibile tramite navette, e posto sulla collina del Tibidabo.

Interni meravigliosi, Spa L'Occitane favolosa, piscina suggestiva e terrazza panoramica con vista incantevole sulla cittá.

Cena meravigliosa tutta con luci soffuse e piccoli assaggi deliziosi.

Per quanto riguarda le camere, non avendo pernottato, non ho notizie in merito, ma per la cura, la pulizia ed il servizio a noi riservato mi sento vivamente di consigliarlo!",5,2015,09,25

Han superado con creces la anterior ocasión: la habitación perfecta, con un salón y dos balcones desde los que teníamos unas vistas espectaculares, en la 4 planta.

28,Grand Hotel mit großartiger Aussicht und nur kleinen Abstrichen,"Wir waren mit unserer Großfamilie 4 Nächte im La Florida. Historie und Lage beeindrucken spontan. Check-In, Parking usw. klappten tadellos. Eck-Zimmer (312) im 3.Stock etwas abgewandt vom Tibidabo-Rummel war völlig einwandfrei, kleine Aufmerksamkeiten und großartiger Ausblick. Telefone am Zimmer sind etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, wir konnten sie nicht bedienen. Betten sind sehr gut, ebenso der Zimmerservice und der Wäscheservice. Abnutzung des Mobiliars konnten wir (wie andere Gäste) nicht feststellen.

Sehr reichhaltiges Frühstück, intern. Zeitungen, angenehmer Service. Abendessen auf der Terrasse war gut, für die kühlen Temperaturen im August auf dem Berg gibt es Decken. Taxi in die Stadt braucht etwa 20 Min., preislich überschaubar. Man fühlt sich jedoch etwas ab vom Schuss in dem ansonsten so quirligen Barcelona! Empfehlenswert für Reisende, die Wert auf einen großzügigen Pool und Grünanlagen legen. Wir hatten das Hotel nicht ausgesucht, waren jedoch durchaus zufrieden, und das obwohl während des Aufenthalts etwas störende Filmaufnahmen stattfanden. Persönlich hätten wir eher ein Hotel in der Nähe der Rambla ausgewählt. Insgesamt war die Zustimmung zum Hotel in unserer Familie sehr gut. Vielleicht daher mal wieder.",4,2015,09,07
28,Estancia que no cubrió las espectativas,"Estuvimos un fin de semana de julio, con la intención de tomarnos un respiro, sin niños, y para disfrutar del momento.

Hotel con instalaciones excelentes y una ubicación espectacular, las vistas en la terraza son inmejorables.

Lo que nos defraudo un poco es la atención recibida, en un hotel de este nivel, mejor que te reciban con una buena sonrisa.

Sobretodo por favor tomen nota que en un desayuno, no pueden recoger la comida mientras sigue habiendo clientes en las mesas o al menos avisar que retiran los platos en breve, justo cuando se termina la hora del servicio. Da muy mala imagen.

Saludos ",3,2015,08,30
28,Un lujo,"Alta hostelería catalana. Simplemente espectacular, tanto en trato como en instalaciones. Para turisteo la verdad es que queda un poco a desmano en el tíbidabo, pero merece la pena ver Barcelona desde alli. Los precios son elevados pero acordes con el servicio ofrecido",5,2015,08,28
28,Esperienza magica,"Sono stato in questo hotel diverse volte. La prima volta per un ricevimento, poi sono tornato per aperitivi/cene e per un intero week end in primavera dello scorso anno. L'esperienza é sempre stata magnifica. Alta qualitá sia nel cibo che del servizio. 
La posizione isolata sul montjuic che sovrasta la cittá la rendono un luogo magico. La piscina con la splendida vista del mare e di tutta Barcellona é una gioia per i sensi. Degna di nota anche la spa all'interno della struttura. Lo consiglio per qualsiasi evento per renderlo speciale.",5,2015,08,18
28,UN FALLO DIFICIL DE ENTENDER,"El Hotel tiene un primer hándicap que es su ubicación en el Tibidabo, primero por que la camino, largo y con curvas continuas resulta incómodo, y segundo por la proximidad del parque de atracciones, ruidoso y no siempre agradable.
Por lo demás es un excelente hotel; las habitaciones de tamaño adecuado, y correctamente equipadas; con buen equipo de TV y sonido.
Excelente el restaurante La Orangerie, especialmente la ""Sommelier"" una profesional apasionada con su trabajo. Y la comida digna de estrella Michelin.
La zona de Spa piscina no resulta demasiado agradable, aunque está bien pensada; pero se mezcla demasiado con el bar/cafetería del hotel.
El bufet de desayuno correcto, sin nada digno de mención ni para bien ni para mal.
Y el servicio correcto, con un pero.
Tuve que dejar la habitación antes que mi mujer y como es lógico dije en recepción que dejaba la cuenta abierta full credit; pese a ello al salir, incomprensiblemente le reclamaron un cargo por el servicio de habitaciones del desayuno... aunque reconociendo que tenían un bloqueo de 100 euros más que suficiente para cubrirlo.
No entiendo un fallo de este tipo en un hotel de este nivel; que lo baja de 5 gran lujo a 5 raspado, y hace bajar la calificación del servicio.
En fín, casi nada es perfecto.
Y me sigo quedando con Casa Fuster.",4,2015,08,07
28,todo perfecto excepto....,"Hotel maravilloso situado al lado del tibidabo,es decir unas vistas espectaculares, pase un fin de semana inolvidable con mi familia,todo perfecto hasta que fuimos al bar de la piscina para comer, nuestra confusión fue que los camareros ninguno hablaba catalán, y mi sorpresa aun peor,es que casi ni me entendían en castellano. Mi reflexión es que un hotel de esta categoría ya sabemos todos que es imprescindible hablar idiomas, pero que estés en tu casa y que no te entiendan nada nos pareció lamentable. Eso si un matiz solo nos paso en bar de la piscina,resto del hotel nos entendió todo el personal y lo demás servicio y atención excelente, sobre todo restaurant orangine. Gracias",4,2015,08,03
28,Románticas vistas de Barcelona,"Fuimos para pasar un fin de semana en pareja y la verdad es que desconectamos un montón y estuvimos muy a gusto.

Las bebidas del bar son un poco carras, pero el resto es perfecto.",5,2015,07,24
28,Barça zu Füssen,"Wer dem Gewimmel der Rambla auch einmal entfliehen will, der hat im Hotel Florida ein gutes Luxushotel mit einer unglaublicher Aussicht auf dem Hügel unweit des Tibidabo Vergnügungspark, aber eben ausserhalb des Zentrums. Hier thront man regelrecht über Barcelona und kann an klaren Tagen Sehenswürdigkeiten wie die Sagrada Família oder Torre Agbar scheinbar aus dem Häusermeer rauspflücken. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig, das Bad mit riesiger Dusche versehen und in Naturstein gehalten. Gewisse Möbel haben zwar kleine Gebrauchsspuren, aber das Zimmer ist sauber und der Schlafkomfort gut.",4,2015,07,16
28,Gran decepcion- Great deception,"El miercoles 1 de Julio decidimos ir a celebrar nuestro septimo aniversario, y escogimos este hotel de cinco estrellas. Gran error.
Al reservar pregunte por su restaurante, L'Orangerie, tiene una terraza con vistas a Barcelona, ademas es un restaurante recomendado, quise reservar una mesa , pero me dijeron que no hacia falta, que no tendriamos problemas pues no tenian reservas. Le comente lo importante del dia, pero insistio. Y me confie.
Al llegar al hotel, nuestra primera vez, la habitacion no era lo que esperabamos por el precio y categoria del hotel pero.... Llame a recepcion para de todas formas reservar, y sorpresa! No habian mesas! Desde mi reserva habia transcurrido dos horas. Estava lleno, ni terraza ni sitio, quizas hacia las diez tendrian un hueco, eso si en el interior... Me quede sorprendida, y le comente lo sucedido. Al cabo de quince minutos llamaron y sientiendolo mucho no habia mesas, que cenaramos en la cafeteria que tienen en el hotel... Decidimos marcharnos. 
Insistieron sin muchas ganas que nos quedaramos, pero poco mas. Vino una señorita encargada de las reservas del restaurante, sin mucho exito tampoco. 
Ni el hotel, ni el personal supieron arreglar una situacion que no creo fuera tan complicada.
Encontramos otro hotel y cenamos en un restaurante romantico en Montjuic, taberna Martinez, en fin no volveremos.",1,2015,07,06
28,MALA,"hay algunas cosas que me han sorprendido y decepcionado un poco del hotel. En mi opinión, y por mi experiencia laboral y lo que he podido comprobar personalmente en este hotel, carece de las estrellas que tiene, y del GRAN LUJO, es una verdadera pena que sea asi. 

Lo que más me entristece es que es la estancia en vuestro hotel, fue un regalo de bodas que nos hizo una amiga, todo muy bien organizado y preparado por ella. Nos buscó un chofer en casa para que nos llevara al hotel, y a nosotros no nos dijo donde ibamos, era todo sorpresa.

Comenzando con la llegada al hotel, el personal de recepción no nos explicaba nada del tipo de habitación etc... etc..., solo que firmásemos para autorizar el depósito, nosotros estábamos comentando lo del regalo, que estábamos todavía procesando información y leyendo los sobres que nos había preparado para la sorpresa mi amiga pero a ellas les daba igual, eran un muro frio, nada simpáticas, muy cortantes y de escasas palabras. Lo poco que preguntamos, no sirvió de nada, porque se nos informó mal, o no se nos dio información: como por ejemplo: cómo puedo llegar a la ciudad, te comentan que te pueden pedir un taxi, pero no te dicen nada de que disponen de un servicio de lanzadera gratuito, y que si te interesa, lo reserves con tiempo.
Si llegas antes de las 3 no te sirven la copa de bienvenida prometida, y tienes que bajar a reclamarla porque en la recepción no hacen el gesto de dártela ni ofrecértela, es un poco vergonzoso, cuando debería ser un DETALLE DEL HOTEL, y más en nuestro caso, regalo de bodas.... y ni un pequeño detalle por su parte que marque la diferencia del hotel, y te haga recordarlo o lo haga especial para que quieras volver, o lo tengas en mente para recomendar a otras personas. 

Ahi no queda la cosa. En la habitación, aparte del molesto ruido del aire acondicionado, y de la carretera que pasa muy cerca, tienes que aguantar el ruido de abrir y cerrar puertas vecinas, y de la señora de la limpieza a las 16.00 horas, etc... un ruido constante que se oye en exceso. Es como si le faltara una puerta entre medio de la habitación y el pasillo de entrada, porque tiene el marco puesto, pero carece de puerta corta ruidos.

En el baño, nos encontramos con muchas toallas, pero cual fue nuestra sorpresa??? muchas de ellas estaban mojadas... o sea, eran usadas!!!! por eso no estaban plegadas correctamente, si no colgadas del toallero, algo que nos pareció raro al principio, cuando las cogimos, vimos que no estaban limpias, nos dio mucho asco, la verdad.
Sin embargo, se habían olvidado poner la toalla de bidé, un poco desastre. 

Continuando con el baño: La tapa del WC de un color amarillento y sucio que daba mucho asco al sentarse, un hotel de lujo no debería permitirse tener este tipo de cosas, que son tan baratas de cambiar, y marcan la diferencia. El soporte del papel del wc se aguantaba a duras penas de un tornillo, porque el otro estaba suelto. Daba miedo estirar de él, porque daba la sensación que nos lo quedaríamos en las manos. 

No nos hicieron la descubierta de la cama, a pesar que en la web está publicado, asi que sumamos más cosas de las que carece, lo mismo que de una carta de almohadas.... y que hoteles de su categoría lo tienen.

Esa noche cenamos en el hotel, y la verdad que la gente del restaurante se portó muy bien con nosotros y la comida es de calidad, no tengo queja, pero al parecer, a partir de las 22 horas, se quedan sin calefacción, y empieza a hacer mucho frio. Esto hace que no se disfrute muy a gusto de la cena, porque hace tanto frio que deseas terminar rápido.

Al dia siguiente en el desayuno, no nos informaron que podíamos pedir platos calientes, y teníamos que escucharlo por el resto de mesas. Estas informaciones deberían compartirse con todo el mundo. O tan sencillo, que esté escrito en un papel en las mesas. Me parece un poco discriminatorio, que a unas personas se les informe y a otras no.

Al marcharnos, dije muchas de estas cosas en recepcion, pero como he dicho antes, las recepcionistas, son en mi opinión las que más carecen de tacto y trato en un hotel de esta categoría, asi que se quedó impasible la chica que nos atendió, que fue la misma que nos recibió el dia de antes, Mariona. Y cuando les comentamos que queríamos volver en el bus lanzadera que había visto en la página web que había este servicio en el hotel aunque ella no nos lo comentó, nos comentó que estaba lleno, a lo que le repliqué, que si esa información nos la hubieran dado el dia que llegamos, hubiésemos podido reservar, y qué solución teníamos??? para ella, tomar con la T10 el bus normal del TIBIDABO que deja en PLAZA CATALUNYA, tal cual, bus que tampoco va con T10, que se tiene que pagar, asi que informaciones, mal dadas, tras otras informaciones.... muy normal no me parece.

No puedo entender si en mi propio idioma no me dan bien la información de algo tan básico como el transporte o el desayuno, como van a tratar bien a los turistas en un idioma que no es el propio???  No es agradable que pasen estas cosas, cuando vamos de viaje a disfrutar y relajarnos. Y más cuando se elige un hotel de una categoría tan alta como 5 estrellas y valorado con el GRAN LUJO!! 

Lo que más me duele, que fue un regalo de nuestra amiga que lo ha trabajado mucho y nos quiere!!! y esta gente con estas pequeñas cosas lo ha estropeado.",2,2015,06,29
28,Comida familiar,"Fuimos a comer al restaurante del hotel. LA comida buena, pero un poco escasa por precio. El servicio impecable, y el hotel i las instalaciones impresionantes. Un lugar realmente agradable para compartir una comida y sobremesa con unas vistas de lujo. Repetiremos seguro.",4,2015,06,29
28,"Pleiten, Pech und Diebstahl","Wir reisten am Sonntag an. Der Weg vom Flughafen dauert mit dem Auto ca. 30 Minuten und ist unkompliziert. Man erkennt den Tibidabo schon von Weitem und das Hotel darauf liegt wirklich idyllisch- von Weitem. Wenn man das Hotel erreicht hat, sieht man den Vergnügungspark, der direkt an das Hotel angrenzt. Dort ist Betrieb von früh bis spät. Der erste Schock!

Das Parken am Hotel ist bequem, jedoch ziemlich teuer. Die Woche kostet 150€
 (- meine ich). 
Der Eingangsbereich und die Rezeption ist schön, die Rezeptionisten sind freundlich. Es kam jedoch schnell das Gefühl auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte. Man fragte uns, ob wir telefonisch nicht informiert wurden. Auf die Verneinung und die Nachfrage worüber wir hätten infomiert werden sollen, geriet der Rezeptionist regelrecht aus der Fassung, gab uns aber kein präzise Antwort. Es war jedoch klar, dass irgendetwas nicht stimmte. Wir bemerkten erst einen Tag später, welche Bedeutung dieser Tatsache zukam.

Erstamal weiter zum Check-in: Man sagte uns, unser Zimmer sei noch nicht fertig (es war 15:15 Uhr) und wir mussten warten. Nach einiger Zeit kam eine junge Dame, führte uns im Hotel herum und brachte uns zu unserem Zimmer. Sie klopfte nicht an, schloss auf und wir traten ein. Blöd war nur, dass das Zimmer belegt war und sich sämtliche Personen darin aufhielten. Wir gingen zurück zur Rezetion, es gab wieder Aufregung, sie nahm einen neuen Schlüssel und brachte uns erneut in unser Zimmer. 

Das Zimmer war im 3. Stock, nicht sehr groß (aber ausreichend), einen Balkon hatte es nicht (hätten wir aber aufgrund des Freizeitparks auch nicht genießen können), dafür gab es aber große Fenster und einen gigantischen Ausblick. 
Die Möbel sind ziemlich zerschlissen, einfach nicht neu, aber in Ordnung. Das Bett war sauber und bequem. Das Bad war grundsätzlich auch ok, nur war unsere Toilette eine echte Frechheit. Die Klobrille war gelb/braun und zerbrochen und das Waschbecken war verstopft und lief somit nicht ab. Dies alles war dieser Sternekategorie nicht würdig. Wir hatten Übernachtung mit Frühstück gebucht. Das Frühstück war genügsam, aber anständig. 

Nun also zu der Unsicherheit des Rezeptionisten: Es war nun also wie gesagt Sonntag. Den Rest des Tages und den Montag waren wir unterwegs und kamen erst spät zurück. Als wir aufs Zimmer kamen, lag dort ein Brief mit der Bitte sich umgehend an der Rezeption zu melden, der wir auch nachkamen. Dort teilte man uns schmucklos mit, dass wir das Hotel am nächsten Morgen zu verlassen hätten, da die Spieler des FC Bayern München das Hotel spontan für zwei Tage beschlagnahmen würden (Halbfinale der Champions League). Äußerst unglücklich daran war, dass unsere Buchung seit 5 Monaten bestand, wohingegen die Buchung des FC Bayern München erst eine Woche vor Anreise eingegangen ist- sie wurden als Gegner erst durch Losverfahren, eine Woche vor Anreise, zugeteilt. Der Rezeptionist wusste also schon bei unserer Anreise darüber Bescheid, dass wir das Hotel zwei Tage später wieder verlassen müssten, gestand es uns aber noch nicht- dies musste ein anderer Kollege einen Tag später übernehmen.

Nachdem wir uns erst weigerten zu gehen, drohte man uns mit Polizeigewahrsam, so dass wir unsere Sachen packten, um das Hotel zu verlassen. Bei dem Packen bemerkten wir dann, dass meine nagelneue Lederjacke aus dem Schrank verschwunden war. Auf Nachfrage bei der Rezeption, sagte man, dass man die Möglichkeit habe die Videoüberwachung der Flure zu kontrollieren. Dies tat man auch, beteuerte aber, dass nur die Putzfrau zu sehen war, die mit einem Wäschewagen das Zimmer betrat und verließ- dabei sah man aber keine Lederjacke. Man könne sich also nicht erklären, wo die Jacke sei und, dass ein Abhandenkommen von Dingen aus den Zimmern höchst ungewöhnlich sei. Das wars. Das Thema war damit für das Hotel erledigt.

Auf den Umzug haben wir uns nur unter der Prämisse eingelassen, dass wir in dem Partnerhotel Miramar ein Zimmer Upgrade mit Meerblick bekommen und bei der Rückkehr ins La Florida ebenfalls ein Upgrade bekommen. Widerwillig im Miramar angekommen, wusste niemand von einem Upgrade und wir bekamen ein Zimmer was quasi Souterrain lag und alles andere als Meerblick bot. Eine erneute Panne also.

Bei der Rückkehr ins La Florida bekamen wir dann ein geräumigeres Zimmer mit einer Sauberen und sogar heilen Toilette....Der Ausblick war auch hier wieder großartig.

Es lief also insgesamt alles schief, was nur schieflaufen kann. Dabei trat das Hotel unfassbar unprofessionell auf, was wir von dieser Hotelkategorie einfach nicht gewohnt waren.

Wem es nur auf den Ausblick ankommt, ist mit diesem Hotel bestens bedient. Wer allerdings Wert auf gehobenen Service, Selbstverständlichkeiten und Ehrlichkeit legt, sollte lieber ein anderes Hotel wählen. Ich kann nur sagen, dass man sich an den Ausblick in zwei Tagen ""gewöhnt"", über den Rest ärgere ich mich aber heute noch.",2,2015,06,09

Por otro lado, la boda no estaba a la altura del hotel: el aperitivo dejaba mucho que desear (la típica paella pasada, pan de cristal blando, la cortadora de jamón no dominaba mucho el tema del corte...). La calidad de la comida no está ni mucho menos a la altura, aunque lo espectacular del lugar es capaz de salvar este inconveniente.",4,2015,03,23

28,"""Enamorada de este rinconcito""","Nos dimos el capricho de una pequeña escapada en nuestra propia ciudad.
El lugar elegido Gran Hotel La Florida, mucho más que un hotel, toda una vivencia y experiencia.
Resumiría mi estancia con estas palabras: lujo, detalles, mimo y servicio.
Lujoso resort urbano junto al Tibidabo con unas vistas increíbles a la ciudad de Barcelona y Mediterráneo. En cuanto entras al hotel puedes sentir la magia de este lugar, te atrapa.
Disfrutamos de su piscina, de tomar un cocktail bajo el sol, del gym, de su spa l'Occitane y de la cuidada gastronomía del restaurante Orangerie.
Estuvimos alojados en una habitación Deluxe con vistas a la ciudad, habitación amplia con todo lujo de detalles y comodidades. 
Destacar el staff y servicio del hotel, sonrisa permanente, predisposición, amabilidad y profesionalidad.
Me sorprendió que desde el centro sólo tardamos 15 minutos, además el hotel dispone de parking. Para aquellos que no tengan coche el hotel ofrece un servicio gratuito de shuttle.
Salí enamorada de este rincón dentro de mi ciudad y consiguieron que mi estancia fuera una experiencia que sin duda repetiría y recomiendaría.",5,2015,03,10
28,DESIGN E POSIZIONI ECCEZIONALI,"La prima cosa che colpisce entrando in questo hotel è la cura del design anche dinamico (vedi cascata d'acqua sul vetro della sala o della scala interna) con una grande sensazione di relax, incluso il sistema di riscaldamento "" a circolo"". Bellissima e di quualità la piscina in-out con vasca in acciaio. Buon ristorante, un po' caro. Vista e posizione eccezionali, consiglio al Signor. AlessioPi16 di mettersi gli occhiali o di bere meno per il semplice motivo che la vista non puo' essere in alcun modo turbata da ""palazzi alti e orrendi"" dato che questo hotel si situa su una collina di diverse cetninaia di metri. Non valuto ""eccezionale"" questo hotel per esserci stato poche ore, ma mi riprometo di farlo per un weekend.",4,2015,03,09
28,Cuestión de detalles,"Cuando reservas habitación en un hotel de 5 estrellas como es el Grand Hotel La Florida, esperas una estancia no solo agradable y confortable, sino cuidada hasta el último detalle. Es más, esperas que sorprenda. No ha sido el caso de nuestra estancia. Desde el momento de llegar hasta el momento de irse se ha respirado un clima de desorganización y falta de profesionalidad del servicio evidente.

- Recibimiento frio (donde está la copa de champan prometida en la reserva)

- 2 horas de espera a que tuvieran la habitación preparada

- Equivocación al traer las maletas (casi 1 hora más de espera)

- Carta de bienvenida que no iba dirigida a nosotros

- MiniBar exageradamente caro y sin agua de cortesía. Sí o sí tienes que consumir.

- Spa ""sin más"". En cualquier gimnasio las instalaciones son mejores.

- El teléfono de la habitación no funcionaba y una de las picas estaba embozada. La habitación estaba limpia en general, excepto debajo de la cama (lleno de polvo). A la cama se le notaban los muelles. Eché de menos alguna silla, mesita o tumbona en la terraza (no había nada).

Resumiendo, falta de cariño y atención a los detalles que esperas de un hotel de esta categoría y que solo puede aportar una dirección/gerencia presente en la gestión del establecimiento que se preocupe por formar a su equipo y por mantener el nivel de exigencia necesario. El equipo parece todo muy joven e inexperto para llevar un hotel de este nivel.

El hotel es genial y su situación inmejorable, pero faltan los detalles. Es lo más complicado de conseguir pero es relativamente barato ya que depende de la voluntad de las personas.",3,2015,02,15
28,Fin de semana,"Hemos pasado un fin de semana en el Hotel. Las instalaciones son fantásticas, y el servicio también.

Nos hemos alojado en una Junior Suite, enorme, con unas vistas increíbles, y una cama muy grande y muy cómoda. Lástima que no tengan puerta en el lavabo, un fallo increíble.

Hemos tenido la posibilidad de probar la comida y muy buena, también la cena especial de San Valentin, un menú exquisito. 

Sólo comentar que nos ha parecido desorbitado el precio del parking, 21 €, creo que es algo que debería estar incluido en la habitación. Y algo que nos ha sorprendido no muy gratamente, es que teníamos el desayuno incluido, y llamamos al servicio de habitaciones para que nos lo trajeran, avisándoles de que ya lo teníamos pagado, y nos dijeron que no suponía ningún coste entonces.

La sorpresa ha sido al dejar la habitación que nos han cobrado una burrada por ese desayuno (lo mismo que por una comida), y al comentárselo a la recepcionista, nos dice con una gran sonrisa y sin inmutarse que eso tiene un coste, y que se olvidaron de decirnoslo del room service... La próxima vez intentaré acordarme y grabar las conversaciones para poder poner una queja ante una situación de abuso como esta, ya que hemos pagado dos veces el desayuno, y una de ellas de ""regalo"" para ellos.

No estaría mal que en esta época de invierno, la terraza tuviera calefactores exteriores para poder disfrutar más de el bar.",4,2015,02,15
28,Excelente Tarde en La Sala ,"Fuimos a conocer este hotel ya que no había nada abierto un domingo por la tarde y nos encanto. Está retirado del centro de Barcelona pero si tenéis el automóvil , vale la pena hacer el viaje y de pasada conocer Tibidalbo. 

Me gusto mucho la decoración y el ambiente zen de este sitio además de que el personal es muy atento. 

Tomamos un chocolate con churros , un par de capuchinos, unas bravas y unos gin and tónics que estaban excelentes. 

Es caro ? Obviamente;
Bravas : €8
Gins : €14 c/u 
Capuchino : € 6 
Chocolate & churros : €10 

Pero vale cada centavo en una ciudad siempre tan congestionada de turismo y rebasada de malos tratos en ducha industria. 

Regresare a cenar !!!",5,2015,02,08
28,Único!,"Un hotel que cuida al cliente y lo mima hasta el último detalle. Tiempo atrás estube no con mucha satisfacción, y para paliar mi estancia me han invitado a pasar una noche estupenda con una cena de lujo en la mejor de las habitaciones. Está siendo estupendo. Maria Cano",5,2015,02,07
28,Molto bello ma non è un 5*GL,"Ho utilizzato questo albergo per un evento aziendale e in linea di massima ci siamo trovati bene. Il punto forte dell'albergo è la vista, che in una stagione più mite, è anche ammirabile dalla piscina e dalla bella terrazza. L'hotel è sì lontano dal centro, ma questo non può essere frutto di critica in quanto è una cosa che si sa, quando si sceglie questo hotel per il proprio soggiorno. Il personale è cordiale e disponibile. Per essere un 5*GL però ho trovato qualche piccola pecca: il servizio navetta hotel/centro è scarso, molto limitato (6 posti 2 o 3 volte al giorno) e su prenotazione molto anticipata. Non vengono offerti molti ""frills"" come uno si aspetterebbe in un hotel 5*GL e ci sono dei piccoli disservizi (ex.la sauna non era in funzione nonostante la spa fosse aperta già da qualche ora, ci sono delle parti un po' vecchiotte e poco curate, per chi ha un occhio attento).",4,2015,02,03
28,Como una princesa!,"Mi pareja me dijo que iríamos a un hotel de carretera...y bueno....que sorpresa la que me llevé yo!!

Vistas al mar con grandes finestrales y todo de detalles para que te mimen.

28,Entrañable puente de diciembre,"El pasado puente de diciembre mi madre y yo decidimos pasar el puente en Barcelona.
Al ser un fin de semana especial, por pasarlo las dos, decidimos hospedarnos en un hotel con encanto.

Nunca antes habíamos estado en este hotel y hemos quedado encNtadas.
Empezando por la localización, la limpieza y el personal tan atento y servicial.
Recomendable 100%.",5,2015,01,26
28,Excelente elección,"Después de nuestra visita a Barcelona con mi mujer solo podemos decir que todo resultó perfecto gracias a este hotel. La ubicación del hotel estupenda cerca de todo lo que hay que ver en Barcelona. Las habitaciones ajustadas a nuestras necesidades y decir que muy muy limpias. El servicio muy amable desde que entramos hasta que salimos del hotel, cosa que en otros hoteles deja mucho que desear. El restaurante con una carta amplia y de lo que probamos todo estaba riquísimo. Y para relajarse que era lo que necesitabamos mi pareja y yo el Spa está súper bien. En resumen. Si quieres disfrutar de Barcelona este hotel merece mucho la pena. ",5,2015,01,26
28,"Perfecto. Y encima, con las mejores vistas de Barcelona","He estado en bastantes hoteles de lujo de Barcelona, pero el hotel La Florida se sale de lo común. Primero, por su emplazamiento, que ofrece impresionantes vistas de la ciudad. Merece la pena pagar un poco más por una habitación orientada al mar. En segundo lugar, por el hotel en sí: estupendas las zonas comunes y estupendas también las habitaciones, donde destacaría la tranquilidad y confort, o un baño con ducha enorme y todos los complementos dignos de un gran hotel. El mobiliario de mi habitación no era moderno, pero tenía esa elegancia de muebles que en su día eran 'top' por calidad y diseño, y que están bien mantenidos. Puestos a pedir, no estaría mal que hubiese más perchas en los armarios. En cuanto a la comida o el desayuno, seré claro: merece un 10. La cena fue excelente y el desayuno no se queda atrás. Y para redondear el trabajo, un servicio atento, profesional y tremendamente amable, desde la recepción hasta el último camarero. Seguid así. Para mi ya sois una de las referencias en la ciudad. El lugar ideal si te lo puedes permitir y no necesitas estar en el centro de la ciudad",5,2015,01,25
28,Excepcional,"No soy muy asidua a dar mi opinión sobre hoteles, restaurantes y demás pero creo que esta vez la ocasión lo merece, celebramos el cumpleaños de mi pareja a la cual decidí regalarle una estancia con cena en el Hotel Florida por sorpresa. Desde el inicio todo fue perfecto, empezando por la copa de vino de bienvenida apreciando la maravillosa vista de la ciudad, siguiendo por la desconexión en el spa y terminando con una habitación de ensueño. 
El hotel Florida sin duda reúne los mejores ingredientes para hacer un plato espectacular, pero son las personas las que lo elaboran y queremos agradecer tanto a Isabella como a Victoria por su amabilidad su simpatía y que tuviera siempre una sonrisa, así como también toda la organización fueron cómplices de toda esta sorpresa siempre atentas de cada detalle para que nuestra velada fuera inolvidable, a Xenia por transmitirnos y contagiarnos su pasión por el vino y la manera de maridarlo, y finalmente a María por sus geniales explicaciones antes de servir cada plato fue una cocina de autor espectacular! Es el servicio de personas así el que hacen que una experiencia bonita se convierta en inolvidable! ",5,2015,01,23
28,Excelente,"Estuvimos 4 dias y el servicio fue exquisito! Que decir de las vistas de la ciudad, inmejorables. Hicimos una tarde de spa y masajes únicos...hotel recomendable para estar alojado en barcelona sin estar en el bullicio.",4,2015,01,12
28,Genial,"Estuve en el Gran Hotel la Florida hace unas semanas y no quería dejar pasar más tiempo para compartir mi experiencia.
Nada más ""aterrizar"" ya nos estaban esperando; el chico de la puerta se sabía nuestros nombres! Aluciné!
La habitación increíble. Llena de detalles y unas vistas a Barcelona que pocas veces había podido apreciar. 
Comimos en el Café 1925. Muy rico y sencillo. No necesitábamos mucho más porque el "" plato fuerte"" llegó cuando bajamos al Spa. Que tranquilidad y que silencio se respiraba! Profesionalidad 100%.
Sin duda, de los mejores hoteles de Barcelona.",5,2015,01,12
28,Il tempo si ferma... dominando Barcellona!!,"Ormai la sesta volta che torno in quest' hotel!!
Ogni volta che penso dall'aeroporto di raggiungere la collina del Tibidabo per arrivare in quest'hotel, penso che sarebbe stato meglio sceglierne uno in centro....ma poi quando scendi e provi la sensazione di dominare la meravigliosa Barcelona fuori dal caos, tutto cambia  e capisco puntualmente che è stata la scelta giusta!!
Un po' surreale a pochi km dalla città ( si può tranquillamente alloggiare li anche se si ha appuntamenti di lavoro in centro )  questa struttura che somiglia ad un castello delle favole e' davvero incantevole!! Personale all'altezza molto gentile, molto belli gli spazi comuni, spa carina ma soprattutto la piscina interna e' gradevole con una vista spettacolare su Barcelona!! Ristorante buono con un Jamon Iberico selezionato straordinario!!! Il pezzo forte ( per questo merita il massimo dei voti ) restano le camere vista città, letti molto belli e curati nella qualità delle lenzuola e dei cuscini, molto spaziose e ben arredate con bagni in marmo grandissimi con vasca e doccia per due persone!! La vista in notturna sulla città e sul Tibidabo illuminato, mentre ci si sta per addormentare e' quello che ogni volta, mi spinge ad uscire un po' fuori dal caos facendo qualche chilometro per uscire per qualche ora dal mondo dove sembra che il tempo si sia fermato... Davvero bello e consigliato!! ",5,2015,01,11
28,"Buen hotel, mala experiencia en mi boda.","Tengo un problema con este hotel, las estancias siempre han sido inmejorables, buena comida, excelente servicio, el problema fue cuando hice mi boda en el, dejo muchísimo que desear la atención, preparación y ejecución. No estuvo a la altura del lugar, la situación en inmejorable, tiene unas vistas extraordinarias pero el servicio fue nefasto.",4,2015,01,11
28,Perfecto!,"Un hotel genial ,con unas vistas impresionantes de Barcelona ......l
La habitación genial con todo lujo de detalles .....tenía vistas a Barcelona y a la montaña ......fue un fin de semana inolvidable .El servicio muy atento..... Y la comida del restaurante muy buena.",5,2014,12,15
28,Boda de ensueño,"El día que Isabella y yo decidimos dar el paso de casarnos no tuvimos dudas de donde queríamos celebrarlo, miramos otras opciones, pero ninguna le hacía sombra, ni por la localización, ni por la profesionalidad, ni por lo que nos ofrecían, y sobretodo por todo lo que nos unía entre el hotel y nosotros, celebraciones, cenas, cócteles con esas increíbles vistas, sin duda había feeling, y por eso nuestra decisión ya estaba tomada, el Gran Hotel La Florida iba a ser el lugar para celebrar nuestro día.
Nos pusimos con los ojos cerrados en manos de los profesionales del hotel, ya conocíamos las instalaciones, sabíamos lo que queríamos, soñábamos con casarnos en ese marco, pero la realidad la superó.
Elisabeth  fue la persona que personalmente se encargó de todos y cada uno de los detalles, una wedding planner de lujo, atenta, dando consejos valiosos, con su profesionalidad nos aportó mucha tranquilidad, desde el primer día que reservamos la fecha, que nos reunimos con ella para iniciar todo, sus aportaciones, su larga experiencia en bodas, no dejó de estar pendiente para que todo saliera según nuestro deseo, y sin duda se notó, en nuestro día no nos tuvimos que preocupar de nada, ella estuvo pendiente de todo para que nosotros solo nos dedicaramos a disfrutar, una pieza importante en que todo saliera tan perfecto.
Todo salió perfecto, desde el día que nos acompañó para poder tener las increíbles vistas que nos acompañaron todo el aperitivo, la atención de los camareros fue increíble, en los tiempos de entrega de comida, en las bebidas, todo según lo habíamos contratado. La cena en el salón Café 19--, que era donde nosotros soñábamos hacerlo estuvo espectacular, con las vistas de la ciudad y con todos los platos deliciosos. Indicar que cuando hicimos la prueba del menú pusimos alguna observación, y todas y cada una de ellas fueron correspondidas el día de la boda, tanto en el aperitivo como en la cena. Respetaron a los alérgicos, los celíacos, todos quedaron muy contentos.
Especial mención hay que dar a Marcos, la persona encargada de la cena. Con él hicimos la prueba del menú, estuvo atento a todas nuestras indicaciones, que el día se llevaron a cabo. Y El día de la boda estuvo a cada instante pendiente de que todo estuviera perfecto, de cual detalle. Un gran profesional que nos aportó mucha tranquilidad ya que la cena no tuvo ningún fallo, todo estuvo delicioso.
Otro gran agradecimiento es para Pepe, el florista, el encargado de todo luciera tan y tan bello, las decoraciones de las mesas eran espectaculares, sus consejos en cuanto a la decoración, aportó una elegancia, una finura, todo a la altura de un hotel  5 estrellas gran lujo.
El fin de fiesta fue en el Club Luna, la discoteca donde pudimos disfrutar del baile, de la barra, un lugar íntimo donde pudimos acabar nuestro gran día.
Consiguieron superar nuestras expectativas, hicieron todo el equipo que guardemos un recuerdo muy bonito de ese día. Todos los invitados nos felicitaron por el lugar, porque todo salió tan bien y gran parte del éxito lo tiene el Gran Hotel la Florida porque hizo una trabajo excelente, y sin duda aconsejaría a cualquier persona para que realice su boda en este hotel y con estos grandes profesionales. Seguirá habiendo este feeling con el hotel y seguiremos celebrando y compartiendo momentos porque vale mucho la pena.",5,2014,12,10
28,Vistas y relax,El hotel está situado al lado del parque de atracciones del Tibidabo con una situación privilegiada. Nos dieron una habitación con una terraza genial con las mejores vistas de barcelona que te puedas imaginar. También vale la pena comer algo en la terraza del hotel.,4,2014,12,07
28,Bonitas Vistas de Barcelona,"Las vistas son lo mejor de este hotel, esta relativamente lejos del centro, el restaurante ha decaído mucho , me atrevería a decir que incluso es malo, carne dura y fría, servicio desagradable, bodega cara. habitaciones correctas.",2,2014,12,02
28,Pessimo,"Nessun cocktail di benvenuto, ho dovuto pagare la mia bottiglia d'acqua (6 euro) mentre aspettavo che la mia camera fosse sistemata. Nessun servizio navetta per il centro cittá in quanto la navetta è da soli 6 posti e fa 3 volte andata e ritorno (su prenotazione). Solo la piscina al di fuori della spa, niente bagno turco o sauna. La reception attacca al telefono prima del cliente. La vista non è fantastica dato che a Barcellona ci sono dei palazzi alti e orrendi. Dopo le mie lamentele, ho ricevuto una lettera di scuse e uno champagne da circa 5 euro (prezzo online).",1,2014,11,30
28,Muy mala orientación al cliente,"Al llegar, en lugar de propocionarnos una habitación con vistas a Barcelona, que era la que ya habíamos pagado, nos dieron una que daba a montaña y a la zona norte de Barcelona. Al pedir el cambio, la respuesta de recepción inicalmente fue desabrida en el tono y cortante en el contenido: ""!Pues esta habitación la vendemos como con vistas a Barcelona!"" Finalmente nos dieron otra mejor. Pero el aire acondicionado no dispone de un termostato y pasaba de expular aire caliente a aire frío. El técnico optó por desconectarlo. Luego pusimos la TV y sólo se veían, de los canales estatales, TV1 y TV3. El técnico que subió nos comentó que había cambiado la sintonización en España (de esto hace un mes) y que él en su casa tampoco captaba los canales que no veíamos. Durante la noche, incluso con el aire acondicionado desconectado, la tempertaura de la habitación ha subido muchísimo y hemos tenido que entreabrir una ventana a las cinco de la mañana. Por la mañana, durante la ducha, el agua hacía ciclos de temperatura con los que pasabas del agua muy caliente a agua tibia. Realmente incómodo. Y para finalizar, a la hora del chek out no me han solicitado la llave de la habitación (porque es una llave y no una tarjeta) y por descuido me la he llevado a casa. Al llegar (vivo en la misma ciudad)  les he telefoneado inmediatamente para ofrecerles la alternativa de pasarla a recoger por portería (abierta doce horas todos los días laborables) o enviarla por correo. La respuesta ha sido que debía desplazarme de nuevo al hotel para devolverla. Ante mi negativa, han dicho que preferín venir a buscarla. Después de todo esto, es imposible pretender que el hotel sea considerado como ""lujo"", tal como lo publicitan.",2,2014,11,23
28,Decepcionante,Hotel 5 estrelles gran lujo inexistente. No havia secador en la habitacions ni zapatillas para estar por la habitacion. Armarios desconchados y sin cajones en el armario del baño. muy sucio. Muy mal servicio. Decepcion absoluta. El restaurante muy malo y extremadamente Caro. El agua de la piscina climatizada estaba fria.,1,2014,11,16
28,No está mal,"La verdad esque no está mal aunque no pude dormir mucho porque mi compañera enfermó pero nos atendieron muy bien. El parkin perfecto , lastima que mi compañera muriese esa noche, pero no tubo nada que ver con el hotel.",3,2014,11,05
28,Muy inferior a lo que se espera de un 5 estrellas gran lujo,"El 25 de octubre de 2014 mi esposa y yo fuimos al spá del ""Gran"" hotel La Florida.  
El público no corresponde con la pretendida categoría. Unos alemanes nos quitaron las hamacas y toallas en la piscina. 
Un francés se debe dedicaba a recoger agua del jacuzzi y escupirla sobre su hija.
De las duchas del vestuario masculino solo una daba agua caliente. 
Sin embargo,  el tratamiento een el balneario fue magnífico. Eso sí,  el balneario es de L'Occitane y ajeno al hotel. Amparo nos trató exquisitamente 
",3,2014,10,25
28,Un oasis en Barcelona,"Fue un regalo de mi pareja, escapada romántica.
La habitación superior, con ventanales franceses, cama extra grande y dos ambientes era todo lo que necesitábamos. Además, tenía preparado un baño romántico con espuma y aceite y pétalos de rosas... Genial!
Por la noche, contratamos room service y la calidad y el servicio... excepcional!
No nos queríamos marchar!
Lo único... en algunos aspectos se nota el paso del tiempo en las instalaciones, el minibar se veía anticuado, el suelo rallado... Pero no es relevante cuando tienes esas vistas panorámicas de Barcelona.",5,2014,10,09
28,BONITO HOTEL CON VISTAS PANORAMICAS,"Bonito hotel para relajarte y desconectar sin salir de Barcelona. Tranquilo de ruidos y vistas panorámicas,,Excelente zona de Spa equipada de piscina interior con vistas al mar. El servicio muy profesional y atento. La cena excelente. Por poner algo a mejorar, el desayuno un poco justo.Habitaciones muy espaciosas y completas con inmejorables vistas. sin duda recomiendo este hotel para una escapada romántica con tu pareja.",4,2014,10,07
28,Un sueño de hotel,"Este hotel está frente al Tibidabo, por lo que tiene unas vistas espectaculares. La habitación en la que estuvimos es sencillamente perfecta: grande, silenciosa, con una cama king size comodísima, el baño con bañera y ducha separadas. Las amenities, de l'Occitanne, son una pura delicia. La recepción del personal mientras hacen el Check In es un gustazo, con copa de cava incluida. 
El SPA es perfecto, las toallas a tu antojo, y la terraza con las hamacas ante una vista espectacular de Barcelona. 
El restaurante de la terraza también es perfecto para una cena informal, la comida deliciosa. 
Es un hotel perfecto para una escapada, como fue nuestro caso, que fuimos para celebrar un aniversario y la verdad, nos hubiéramos quedado a vivir. 
Volveremos sin ninguna duda.",5,2014,10,07
28,Vistas y trato excepcional,"Ha sido la segunda vez que he vuelto, y la verdad es que cada vez que voy mas me gusta. Las vistas son, sin lugar a duda, las mejores que puedes tener hacia la ciudad de Barcelona. 
El trato del personal es perfecto. 
Nunca me he alojado, pero estoy segura de que se debe estar genial, ya que la decoración del hall es impresionante, la piscina exterior tambien, y la terraza es aun mejor. 
",5,2014,10,05
28,Traum-Wochenende!,"Romantisches Grand Hotel, toller Pool (komplett aus Edelstahl). Restaurants fanden wir gut, aber nicht überzeugend - lieber in eine der tausend Tapas Bars in der Stadt gehen. Das Taxi ins Zentrum kostet rund 20 € pro Fahrt, da das Hotel oben auf dem Berg und somit etwas weit ab vom Schuss liegt.
Tolles Frühstücksbuffet!",5,2014,09,29
28,Fantastica estancia,"Hemos estado una noche en Gran hotel La Florida. Personal muy amable en todas las estancias del hotel . Junior suite con vistas fantásticas a la ciudad. Habitación grande y limpia .Baño grande, con muchas toallas. El SPA muy bonito y agradable. El servicio de masajes inmejorable. El desayuno bien. Del restaurante no puedo opinar pues no usamos este servicio. Volveremos con nuestros hijos sin duda!",4,2014,09,21
28,Ambiente tranquilo y vistas inmejorables,"Pasamos nuestra breve luna de miel en el hotel y fue inmejorable. La habitación y las instalaciones nos gustaron, pero ver amanecer desde el balcón sobre toda Barcelona no tiene precio. Repetiríamos una y otra vez.",4,2014,09,04
28,Realmente un 5 estrellas lujo,"Lo primero que describiría a este  hotel es que realmente merece la catalogación que tiene como 5 estrellas lujo. Nos alojamos con un paquete de escapada romántica de una noche con cena. 
En primer lugar una mención al trato recibido por el personal tanto a la llegada como durante la estancia. Resultaban muy amables y detallistas sin caer en la pesadez y la pompa como ocurre en algunos establecimientos de este tipo. Lo mismo con los camareros durante la cena. 
La habitación que elegimos daba a la ciudad ( las hay con vistas a la montaña), merece la pena este tipo de habitación por las increíbles vistas desde el Tibidabo a todo Barcelona. La habitación espaciosa y con decoración elegante y muy bonita. El baño en tres cuartos separados con ducha y bañera. Durante la estancia y mientras cenábamos nos prepararon un baño romántico, que fue perfecto cuando subimos el agua estaba a la temperatura ideal acompañado d pétalos de rosas y una fondie de chocolate y fresas. 
Las instalaciones del hotel muy bien a destacar la zona de spa, cuya piscina interior se comunica con la exterior donde hay una zona de bar restaurante. 
El restaurante tiene una terraza en inclinación desde donde ves toda la ciudad tomando algo. 
La cena degustación del paquete fue correcta con calidad en los platos. 
El desayuno muy variado y rico. 
Un lujo de hotel recomendado para ocasiones muy especiales. No es barato pero lo vale de sobra. 
Lo recomendaríamos100%.

28,Immer gerne!,"Zum zweiten Mal waren wir in diesem Hotel oberhalb Barcelonas.....Erneut waren wir von der Lage und dem einzigartigen Ambiente begeistert.....Als Start unseres Sommer Urlaubs an der Costa Brava verbrachten wir erneut 2 perfekte Tage im Hotel!!!
der Standard entspricht spanischen 5 Sterne Hotels.....Kleinigkeiten dürfen den Gesamteindruck nicht schmälern!
Lage und Ambiente überzeugen einfach und sollten genossen werden! Ohne Wenn und Aber.....
Wir kommen bestimmt wieder......",5,2014,08,31
28,Boda maravillosa,"Buenos dias, 
Solo queria hacer un comentario respecto a la celebración de bodas en este hotel. Nosotros estuvimos en una boda el año pasado y fue increible. El cocktail (aperitivo) en la terraza con todas las vistas eran el marco perfecto para acompañar a todos los platos que nos fueron sirviendo , todos buenisimos. La cena fue en el interior y a pesar de estar en la zona de la piscina la decoración era preciosa, no notas en ningun momento que en realidad es una zona de aguas, yo me enteré mucho después. El servicio impecable, siempre con una sonrisa. Por eso no he entendido la opinión respecto a la boda abajo descrita.Nos gustó tanto que hemos decidido regalar a una pareja de amigos una noche con un paquete este fin de semana. Ya os diré cuando se vayan qué tal fue. Espero que lo disfruteis!",4,2014,08,27
28,Repetiría cada año!,"Es un hotel que descubrí hace años y la verdad es que cada vez me gusta más! Nunca había estado en verano y aún es más agradable, porque la zona de la piscina y las tumbonas con esa impresionante vista, no tiene precio. Como he estado varias veces, he visto varias habitaciones, y la verdad es que en general todas son buenas. si puedes pagar un poco más, mejor que sea con balcón, pero sobretodo pide que tenga vistas a la ciudad porque , aunque las de vista a la montaña también son bonitas, si eres de fuera, que no es mi caso, y no has estado en Barcelona, las que dan a la ciudad son muy bonitas. Las habitaciones estan decoradas como debia de serhace años este hotel, con encanto clásico pero si ser ñoño. Los baños son muy espaciosos y en la mayoría tienen bañera y ducha. El spa con la piscina interior es una gozada, y normalmente no hay mucha gente. Los servicio s de masajes etc, son caros, pero como en otros sitios de esta categoría. El desayuno buffet muy bueno y variado. La única pega del hotel es que al ser un hotel alejado del centro, es indispensable coche, ya que tienen un servicio de shutel al centro pero muy limitado, creo recordar de solo 2 horarios. En taxi hasta el centro son unos 10€. Un hotel totalmente recomendable para ocasiones especiales porque es muy romántico. en familia , mejor ir a otro sitio. El precio si lo miras con tiempo, sale muy bien para ser un 5 GL.",5,2014,08,21
28,No adecuado para eventos,"No celebres tu boda ni un evento importante allí. No recibimos lo que habíamos contratado. Nuestros invitados (120 personas) hablaban de la escasez y falta de comida, cuando nosotros habíamos pactado algo bastante distinto. El servicio de camareros muy bueno. Faltas muy grandes por parte del ""management"".",1,2014,07,27
28,Una boda y no volvería,"Estuvimos en una boda en mayo. Estuvimos esperando al aperitivo una hora y media (con bastante hambre, la verdad). Muy mala atención por parte de la organización, vi a los novios tristes por cómo iba todo. La boda era de cocktail, y hubo platos que se acabaron volando y otros que se repetían una y otra vez. Los camareros excelentes, pero si la dirección no funciona, poco pueden hacer. Una pena.",1,2014,07,16
28,Cuanta amabilidad,"Fuimos a comer un dia. Que guapa la persona que nos atendió en recepción y nos acompañó al restaurante. Qué vistas...qué bonito...
Con la piscina cerca y las vistas y a la vez la tranquilidad que se respiraba.",5,2014,07,10
28,Se les ha caido por lo menos una estrella,"Reservé 4 habitaciones para mi familia y unos amigos durante la primera semana de Julio. 
Empiezo por LO BUENO:
- Vistas impresionantes de Barcelona.
- Mayoría de personal amable y con buena disposición (aunque no siempre les acompañan los resultados).
- Buen trato del departamento de reservas para negociar la mejor tarifa posible.
- Conociendo las deficiencias del hotel, muy bien reflejadas en los comentarios de Tripadvisor, volveríamos siempre que el precio se adecuara a la categoría real del hotel.
Resumiré la PARTE MALA:
- El mantenimiento de las habitaciones deja mucho que desear (por ejemplo: la 209 tiene el controlador del aire acondicionado del dormitorio roto e inservible, el equipo hace mucho ruido con ventilación fuerte, hay bombillas fundidas, entre otras la del espejo de afeitarse/maquillarse del baño, se notan reparaciones de pintura en la pared...)
- No hay forma de conseguir en todo el hotel un cartel de ""no molesten"" porque dicen que se los llevan los clientes. Tuve que fabricarlo yo con papel ya que por la mañana han abierto dos veces la puerta para limpiar estando nosotros dentro.
- Seguramente podrán comprobar que debajo del sofá grande del salón se encuentra una avispa muerta, que debe llevar tiempo allí. Limpieza deficiente.
- Un día pedimos que hicieran la habitación a las 11:00 por tener que arreglarnos para una boda y a las 17:00h no la habían hecho.
- A la llegada, se olvidaron poner una cama supletoria solicitada en la reserva para mi hija.
- El restaurante es caro y muy pero que muy normalito.
- Aún sigo ""peleando"" para que me envíen una de las facturas correctamente y me abonen una cargo a mi visa de 536€ realizado por el departamento de reservas, que no tienen controlado.
- Mi habitación (junior suite) estaba reservada para 4 (matrimonio, una niña y un bebé), sin embargo ponían toallas para 2 y he tenido que pedir más en varias ocasiones.",2,2014,07,10
28,el mejor hotel de Barcelona,"con gran sorpresa, ya que es un hotel de los que apenas se sabe nada. La ubicación es maravillosa, rodeado de pinos, haciendo terrazas que caen hacia Barcelona y el mar...Habitaciones espectaculares. Un Spa, que la piscina sale hasta el jardín, donde puedes desde tomar una copa a comer con barbacoa. El personal es muy profesional y agradable. Esta lleno de esos pequeños detalles que hacen especial un hotel.",5,2014,06,27
28,Excelente Hotel 5 estrellas!,"Fuimos por tres días en una escapada de la ciudad, y realmente es un hotel que vale la pena. Un 5 estrellas REAL. Las vistas son incomparables, la gente amable y siempre con una sonrisa. Sobre todo gracias al chico que nos atendía en el Room Service que lo hace aún mejor. La piscina es muy grande y se ve todo recién pintado y cuidado. El Hotel te permite estar alejado del bullicio de la ciudad pero al mismo tiempo estás en el centro en 15 minutos si así lo deseas. Si lo que se busca es un Hotel que piense en los detalles, este es el Hotel. VALE LA PENA IR. Felicidades por una gran estancia.",5,2014,06,25
28,Fantastica opción para parejas,"Opción de lujo a buen precio en Barcelona. Tiene todos los detalles de un gran lujo; fantasticas instalaciones, servicio perfecto, y unas vistas espectaculares de la ciudad. Muy buena opción para fines de semana romantico. La terraza con la piscina y la zona de spa son el punto clave de este hotel. La cocina tambien es recomendable.
Como inconvenientes hay que tener en cuenta que se encuentra a las afueras y necesitas 20minutos para llegar al centro de barcelona. Te ofrecen un servicio de shuttle varias veces al dia. Si no esta disponible siempre podeis bajar en el bus de linea. ",4,2014,06,22
28,Excelente!!,"Un trato excelente, instalaciones increibles.

Un hotel ideal para desconectar del ajetreo de la ciudad, del día a día. Sin la necesidad de tener que hacer kilometros y más kilometros, te encuentras en un entorno muy agradable a 15 minutos del centro de Barcelona. 

Muy, muy recomendable!!!",5,2014,06,18
28,Expectativas rotas,"Decidí regalarle a mi pareja por su cumpleaños una noche en este hotel. Tengo que reconocer que por el precio y la fama del hotel, tenía las expectativas muy altas por lo que la decepción fue bastante mayor. Las vistas son espectaculares y la atención es bastante buena, pero creo que descuidan muchísimo los detalles además de algún ""error"" en cuanto a limpieza.
A la llegada al hotel el recibimiento es impecable, te aparcan el coche, te dan una copa de cava mientras esperas para el check in y cargan tus maletas. Pero una vez en la habitación vimos que, aunque lo había pedido expresamente por email comentando que era un regalo para mi pareja y quería una cama doble, las camas eran 2 individuales. Tuvimos que esperar a que vinieran a juntarlas y tener a la chica un buen rato en nuestra habitación para conseguirlo. Al mirar en la papelera había una bolsa de patatas vacía y los restos de una manzana, los muebles de la terraza estaban llenos de telarañas y la luz de la terraza no funcionaba. En la habitación NO había secador de pelo, ni los típicos carteles de ""no molestar"" y además la puerta del minibar no funcionaba por lo que la nevera no enfriaba. Esto sin nombrar la falta de detalles como agua de cortesía, flores, bolígrafos, cerillas, o cualquier detalle que esperas en hoteles de esta categoría.
Los precios del bar eran exageradamente caros, pero obviamente tienes que consumir allí porque no hay nada en kilómetros a la redonda.
Y... OJO con el parking, porque ese señor amable que te recibe a tu llegada y te pide las llaves del coche sin decirte nada más, resulta que te cuesta 21€ por día en el momento del check out.
Como punto fuerte sin duda alguna, la piscina y las vistas de la ciudad. 
En general, el hotel no está mal y tiene cosas que le dan un encanto único, pero ni de lejos es un 5* Gran Lujo.",3,2014,06,16
28,Da favola,"Sono stata settimana scorsa in questa favoloso albergo con mio marito e i mie due figli, mia figlia mi ha detto che li pareva di essere in un castello de principesse ! Il cibo ottimo, il personale gentile e attento, la picina bellissima e il trasporto per arrivarci comodissimo, in più c'è un parco giochi acanto con tante giostre che ai mie figli a piasciuti tantissimo . Lo raccomando tantissimo per le familie .",5,2014,06,10
28,Todo muy bien excepto el restaurante L'Orangerie,"El Hotel tiene una situación inmejorable dentro de la ciudad, la decoración está muy bién cuidada, el olor que hay en todo el hotel es fascinante y el servicio también es muy correcto. La única pega que le hemos encontrado es el menú degustación del restaurante l'Orangerie. La noche que cenamos  se celebraba una boda en el Café 1925 y además de tener que escuchar la música de la boda, tardamos 3 horas en cenar, parece ser que la cocina estaba muy ocupada con la boda y entre plato y plato tardaban tanto que se nos hizo la cena pesada y aburrida.",4,2014,06,06
28,Lujo decepcionante,"Reservamos una noche en este hotel para una ocasión especial y la verdad es que dejó mucho que desear. A la llegada nos dijeron que nos havían hecho un upgrade a una Suite duplex y nos hizo mucha ilusión, pero pronto sabríamos porque ""la regalaban"". Las cortinas tenían un millón de agujeros, viejas y deshiladas, la carta de bienvenida era para alguien que no eramos nosotros (estaba en alemán), la bañera preciosa pero no salía agua, la ducha estaba llena de cal y el agua salía por todos lados, sin presión. Por la mañana avisamos a mantenimiento pero en una hora no subió nadie, como teníamos que irnos al final nos dutxamos como pudimos. También usamos el spa y es una pena porque está totalmente abandonado y descuidado, el desayuno buffet muy escaso para un hotel de esta categoría. Al salir lo explicamos todo a la recepcionista y ni se disculpo, le pedimos una encuesta de satisfacción y dijo que no tenían, que lo apuntaban en un papelito y pasaban nota, la verdad es que alucinamos. No hemos recibido ni un email del establecimiento, creo que no les llegó nada. La verdad es que no volvería y no lo recomendaría a nadie. Lo mejor sin duda las vistas, está en un sitio precioso.",2,2014,06,04
28,"Tiene categoria de gran lujo, pero no lo es.","Cuando uno va a un hotel gran lujo, lo que espera es la perfeccion en todos los detalles, ya que en principio se trata de lo mejor de lo mejor. Pero eso no fue lo que nos encontramos y es una lastima, porque las espectativas eran altas.
Para mi los detalles son imprescindibles y la verdad es que parecía estar en un cuatro estrellas. Nada mas entrar en la habitación nos encontramos que la puerta del minibar no se acababa de cerrar, el cabezal desconchado, así como la parede que toca a las mesitas de noche y las cortinas manchadaas. El tope de la puerta que a su vez podría hacer de colgador en el lavabo estaba descolgado (se ha de decir que se dijo y enseguida lo arreglaron) y el lavabo sin puerta (aunque antiguamente habría habido una, ya que la guia estaba), lo cual carecía de sentido darse un baño, ya que te pelabas de frío por carecer de puerta, al igual que cuando sales de la ducha.
Al nivel de servicio y del resto del hotel, simplemente correcto. La verdad es que está situado en un sitio privilegiado con unas vistas increibles, por lo que hace despistar de como está el comedor (en concreto las mesas con poco mantenimiento) y el tipo de buffet del desayuno, que es más bien escaso y sin muchas pretensiones. 
La verdad que nos decepcionó un poco por lo que he comentado antes, al ser de gran lujo esperas que todo esté perfecto y que no te de la sensación de estar en un cuatro estrellas.",3,2014,05,31

28,Falta de comunicación entre el personal y poco resolutivos,"En general buena,pero puntualizar tres cosas.
Reservamos una honneymoon con salida a las 14:00 y desde las 12:00 entraron 4 personas distintas a limpiar la habitacion!nos pareció terrible,rompieron la magia de noche de bodas!!la otra cosa necesitamos un cargador de movil y no fueron capaces de subirlo a la habitacion tuvimos que bajar a buscarlo y entre ellos no se entendian tampoco y lo peor el personal habla mejor el inglés y apenas el español!!realmente nos fuimos con mal sentimiento.ah!tambien tardaron en llamar al taxi.
gracias",5,2014,05,06
28,Fin de semana de relax,"El hotel está ubicado en una localización inmejorable a la que accedimos con el servicio de transfer del mismo hotel. Nos dieron un upgrade a una de las habitaciones de diseño, preciosa. Disfrutamos del servicio de spa, a cargo de dos personas extremadamente amables. Los problemas que pudimos encontrar fueron solucionados rápidamente, y todas nuestras dudas resueltas. Como punto débil comentar que muchas de las personas a cargo del servicio contaban con (evidentemente) poca práctica en el puesto. Destacaba el excelente trato de los profesionales con más experiencia. Claramente recomendable.",4,2014,04,29
28,gran servicio personalizado,"Noche de celebración de cumpleaños de mi pareja.Habitación con vistas espectaculares, gran atención del personal, detalle de cumpleaños... todo perfecto .
El hotel no está en el centro de la ciudad pero merece la pena el desplazamiento!",5,2014,04,23
28,Una experiencia de Lujo,"El sitio más exclusivo con las mejores vistas de Barcelona, ese es el Gran hotel La Florida. Un hotel que derrocha elegancia con sus colores tenues y una magnífica decoración, la lámpara central es simplemente un magnífico diseño que impresiona. La piscina de aluminio con una longitud espectacular es magnífica para disfrutar nadando varios largos, para luego relajarte en el jacuzzi y la sauna. El que conoce el Hotel sabe lo que es disfrutar de una velada cuyo fondo es todo un espectáculo la grandiosidad de todo Barcelona a tu alcance.
El personal destaca por su variedad de nacionalidades su conocimiento de todos los idiomas que hacen un ambiente internacional que agradece las atenciones que les brindan en su propio idioma 
Y todo ello con la mejor de sus sonrisas, todos nos han regalado su elegante atención y sobre todo sus sonrisas, gracias.
El restaurante Orangerie nos sorprendió con su elaborado menú degustación, con una salvedad los postres, más variedad no tan autóctona se agradecería.
La carta de la cafetería si sería deseable que introdujeran más variedad, menos escasa y con precios más adecuados a lo que sirven, especialmente los 9 tacos de queso presentados en una lata de sardinas.
Destacar las camas del Hotel, simplemente invitan al descanso absoluto, con unas magníficas sábanas perfectamente planchadas y suaves.
Nuestra estancia ha sido deliciosa, es nuestra segunda vez y seguro repetiremos.",5,2014,04,21
28,"UN ERROR, UN CARO ERROR","Si quieres un hotel a 30 minutos del centro en coche o taxi, este es tu hotel. Si quieres un hotel en el que por el solo hecho de dejar tu coche en la entrada, te cobren por el parking sin avisar, este es tu hotel. Si quieres un hotel con un baño que huele mal, o con una ducha en la que aparece un hierro oxidado en el desagüe, este es tu hotel.
Lo único bueno que tiene es la ubicación, que permite divisar todo Barcelona, el resto no se adecua en absoluto a una supuesta categoría de cinco estrellas, desayunos buffet escasos, sin elementos básicos como el agua en más de una ocasión....
Y mucho cuidado con la factura al salir, aparte del ""regalo"" del parking (17EUR/día) por haber dejado el vehículo en algún momento en el hotel, con independencia del tiempo, aparecen gastos no realizados tanto en la habitación como en la cafetería.
No lo recomiendo en absoluto....
",1,2014,04,16
28,Uno de los hoteles con más encanto de Barcelona,"Este hotel siempre nos ha parecido el más bonito de Barcelona, parece dibujado en el cielo ahí en lo alto de la montaña del Tibidabo…

Pero cuando lo visitas no sólo es bonito, tiene mucho encanto!

Hemos pasado un fin de semana disfrutando de una habitación con vistas a la ciudad increíble! hemos disfrutado del spa y de nuestra preciosa habitación, me han encantado las amenities de l'Occitane y el detalle de entrar a media tarde a abrir la cama…

Tampoco hay que perderse su cocina, cenamos en la terraza (cubierta) del Cafe 1925 con comida deliciosa y preciosas vistas a la ciudad de noche… y un aperitivo en la misma terraza, en la parte descubierta para contemplar el perfil de la ciudad de día, si el día está despejado se ve hasta el mar y se puede distinguir hasta el oleaje, impresionante!",5,2014,03,24
28,Buen hotel,"Personal muy profesional, habitaciones limpias y con un completo cuarto de baño donde no faltan las zaptillas para andar por la habitación.
Desayuno muy completo y las vistas desde la terraza son fantasticas, tanto el amanecer con el atardecer son una pasada.
Lo recomiendo,",4,2014,03,17
28,5*... No Gran lujo,"Desde luego se merece las 5* pero no el gran lujo. La atención al c/in es sencilla, sobria y perfecta. Las zonas nobles del hotel muy bien decoradas y cuidadas. Piscinas, jardines y el servicio de bar inmejorable.... pero todo pierde con lo más importante en un hotel, las habitaciones.

Nos ofrecieron un upsell gratuito a una habitación, en mi opinión terrible, de dimensiones enormes y sin a penas mobiliario lo cual crea una sensación un tanto desconcertante. Pero no deja de ser una apreciación personal. 

En cuanto a los detalles del mantenimiento y limpieza de la habitación es donde, según mi opinión entra el gran lujo y en el hotel, brillaban por su ausencia... grifos con embellecedores rotos, baldosas de la ducha sueltas, enchufes en este caso el del secador también despegado, espejos con huellas.... son pequeños detalles que en conjunto hacen que un hotel de estas características pierda el mimo, que diferencian a los hoteles de éste tipo.

En general un buen hotel que lo es gracias al entorno, instalaciones y al personal. Pero no va más allá.",4,2014,02,13
28,Muy buena ubicación pero poca profesionalidad.,"Personal poco cualificado para considerarse un 5 estrellas.

Falta de sensibilidad al idioma del país. Salvo dos personas (recepción y restaurante) el resto de personal no entendían y además se bloqueaban cuando nos dirigíamos en catalán. Que pena que en un hotel de Barcelona te sientas tan poco acogido.

El restaurante, de muy buena calidad, todo y que fué la primera vez que pidiendo un steak tartar, ni me preguntaron cuales eran mis preferencias de sabor ni tampoco lo prepararon en la sala.",3,2014,02,11
28,Excelente Hotel para un buen fin de semana,"Este hotel yo no lo conocía, pero mi esposa en el 25 aniversario de boda, y juntamente con los profesionales del hotel me hizo pasar una noche inolvidable, la verdad que este hotel, el entorno que divisas toda la ciudad d Barcelona, y la vista desde fuera mirando el hotel tiene  sus encantos, lo aconsejo para ir en pareja y con amigos",5,2014,01,31
28,hotel en decadencia...,"Quería sorprender a mi marido con una noche en hotel con spa, de 5 estrellas gran lujo, Ni 5 estrellas ni gran lujo.  Cuando llegamos el spa no funcionaba, la habitación con el suelo totalmente rallado (pongo fotos para que no penséis que exagero), el minibar roto, con una bandeja encima por patatas (muy cutre).  El secador pegado con celo.  Los productos de la marca Occitanne que te indican en la web... nada de nada...  Nos fuimos del hotel y prometieron en llamarme ayer algún responsable porque no querían que nos fuésemos con esa mala impresión... aún estoy esperando... Nos dieron la opción de una habitación mejor pero ya estábamos desilusionados, desencantados...No entiendo como puede estar catalogado de 5 estrellas y aún más, de gran lujo.  Lo único bueno, las vistas, que no dependen de la calidad del hotel.  Nada recomendable.  Echaron a perder mi fin de semana.",1,2014,01,14
28,Hotel el gran desastre.,"Al llegar nos han recibido bien con Copita de cava.  Cuando nos han enseňado el hotel, una chica de prácticas le dice a la chica del hotel que el spa ni funciona. Primer palo porque nos nos habían dicho nada y era una de las cosas que nos apetecía para el fin de semana de relax. Cuando nos suben a la habitación me quería morir, pequeňa, suelo totalmente rallado, mueble Bar roto... Llamamos a recepción por lo del spa, y nos dicen que lo van a arreglar que está a 22 grados y que sube medio cada hora x lo que descartado.  Para compensar me dicen que me preparan un baňo romántico en la habitación en una baňera que no cabía ni yo sola, así que no quiero ni pensar los dos metidos.  Le digo que no y que además la habitación es un desastre que ni merece para nada la categoría de 5 estrellas GL.  Ya de mala leche, me quitaron la ilusión del fin de semana romántico con mi marido, por lo que a pesar de ofrecernos después una habitación superior hemos decidido irnos y al menos nos han anulado la reserva.  Una pena porque las vistas preciosas pero la habitación fea, antigua, estropeada....  no recomendable.",1,2014,01,11
28,Unas vistas de ensueño,"Pasamos la nochevieja en el hotel y todo fue maravilloso. Las vistas del hotel por su ubicación lo hacen de ensueño. Una noche inolvidable. 
Lo mejor de la habitación es sin duda la cama, el tamaño y la comodidad son espectaculares.
Algo a mejorar en la habitación podria ser disponer de secador de pelo.",4,2014,01,09
28,Posizione incantevole ma lontano dal centro,"Per chi volesse passare qualche giorno in relax a Barcellona, questo hotel potrebbe essere la scelta giusta in quanto dotato di un bel centro benessere, piscina esterna e vista mozzafiato sulla citta. Sì, perchè il Gran Hotel La Florida si trova sulla collina prospiciente Barcellona, in posizione più che decentrata. Chi vuole fare un giro in città deve mettere in conto dai 20 ai 30 minuti di taxi prima di arrivare, ad esempio, nelle ramblas. Per il resto l'hotel è una struttura di gran lusso con camere e servizi adeguati al rango. Buona cucina, ottima colazione (completissima) e spazi comuni smisurati.",4,2013,11,24
28,Hotel de ensueño,Suelo ir cada semana a disfrutar de una comida a veces cenas y en alguna ocasión disfrutar de las vistas en la terraza del hotel.Por su inmejorable situación y maravillosas instalaciones le hace un lugar especial y sobretodo muy tranquilo. lo recomiendo a aquellas personas que busquen paz y sosiego.,4,2013,10,04
28,Entorno precioso y personal muy atento,"Mi marido me dio la sorpresa de pasar una noche en este hotel. La atencion del personal es excelente, muy atentos en todo momento. La unicacion del hotel preciosa counas vistas impresionantes. El hotel en si a simple vista cumple con las expectativas de un hotel de cinco estrellas. Nos alojamos en la suite junior 603, habitacion amplia y luminosa con sofa, un vestidor a la entrada impresionante con dos armarios enormes, cama comoda y grande, lavabo muy grando con doble lavabo, bañera y ducha muy grande. La limpieza de la habitacion dejaba bastante que desear, ni en un 3 estrellas me he encontrado con... Pelos en la cama, el vaso del lavabo para los dientes con el fondo lleno de pasta de dientes, puede pasr porque lo lavan en lavavajillas pero creo que eso se tiene que revisar. El techo de donde estaba el water sucio, habian pintado y habia churretones de pintura en las baldosas, una pena porque eran muy bonitas y el suelo tambien, olia mal, no tenia buena ventilacion. No disponiamos de cepillos de dientes, gorros de ducha, maquinilla de afeitar...aunque dejaron una tarjeta, arrugada de haberse mojado y secado, indicando que si necesitabamos algo lo solicitasemos en recepcion. La puerta del lavabo no existia, imagino que se rompio y no la volvieron a colocar, era corredera porque se veian loas railes en el techo, la eche en falta sobre todo por la noche. Los grandes y bonitos ventanales tenian sucion los cristales. Nos extrañó muchisimo todo esto, hemos estado en muchos hoteles y nunca nos encontramos algo asi y menos lo esperabamos de uno con esa categoria. Nos llenaron la bañera, petalos de rosa, cava y fresas con chocolate, perfecto!! lastima que la bañera era pequeña para dos, me toco la parte del tapon y como tenia una muesca en la pintura me hice cortes en dos dedos!! Lo del vaso lo dije al marcharnos y ademas de pedirnos disculpas nos dijeron que teniamos que haber llamado fuese la hora que fuese y lo habrian solucionado, lo del tapon se me olvido comentarlo. Teniamos cena incluida, comida correcta, pan muy bueno y atendidos en todo momento, qzas demasiado porque nos retiraban el plato casi con el ultimo bocado en la boca, a m me gusta mas pausado entre plato y plato. El spa muy bonito, encontramos el agua un poco fria para estar climatizada, pero nos gusto mucho sobre todo las tumbonas escalonadas que te dan intimidad. El desayuno nos gusto mucho, muy variado y abundante, me gusto mucho la leche con mente y la de canela. E personal muy atento. Al pedir cafe directamente nos llenaron la taza con cafe de ese aguado, americano, le pregunte si no tenian expresso y me dijeron que si. Creo que debian preguntar primero. E general la experiencia muy buena aunque vuelvo a repetir que me esperaba mas para un 5 estrellas.",4,2013,09,11
28,Es bonita su vista,"Se ve Barcelona desde su terraza que queda al frente de su piscina, el hotel en general es bueno, lastimosamente no tuvimos internet en la habitacion 119.
Me gusto mucho el spa, tome un maravilloso masaje relajante y la piscina en forma de 'L' comunica la parte externa con la parte interna.",3,2013,09,02
28,Perfecto,"Pasamos en este hotel espectacular nuestra noche de bodas y que decir...¡Fue simplemente perfecto! Las habitaciones son estupendas y disponen de un gran balcón y grandes ventanales con unas vistas increíbles de toda la ciudad y del fantástico castillo de montjuic...La libre entrada a la piscina (exterior e interior) y al Spa son otro punto más a favor. También aprovechamos para comer en el restaurante L'Orangerie y quedamos encantados. En definitiva, un gran hotel con una atención excelente.",5,2013,08,31
28,Dilemma,"..ist der Titel meiner Beschreibung dieses Orts, weil ich mich fragen musste, wie viel meiner Erwartung ich in diesen Report mit einfliessen lassen wollte. Ich denke, jeder der hier schreibt muss sich diese Frage stellen, eine objektive Berichterstattung ist auch nicht unbedingt zu erwarten. Dennoch ist es wichtig, seine Neutralität und Motivation zu überprüfen, bevor man eine schlechte Bewertung abgibt. Meine Motivation ist nicht Ärger, sondern Entrüstung über Zustände in diesem Hotel. Lesen Sie selbst. 
Machen Sie sich Ihr eigenes Bild.
 
Unsere Ankunft im Gran Hotel stand unter einem guten Stern, wir hatten soeben die ersten drei Tage in Barcelona in einem perfekten B&B verbracht (siehe dazu den Bericht über das ""circa 1905"" in meiner Liste) und waren aufgrund dieser Erfahrungen auf noch mehr Luxus und Dienstbarkeit eingestellt (schwer zu toppen allerdings, das gebe ich zu).

Bei Ankunft wurden wir über alle Massen hinaus freundlich empfangen, Valet Parking, Türschlag öffnen, freundliches Lächeln und sofortige Abnahme des Gepäcks und Verfrachtung in einen Wartebereich vor dem Conciergebereich.

Dort wurden wir mit einem Glas Cava und Wasser bedient und warteten auf den Eincheckvorgang.

Nach einer Viertelstunde Wartens wurden wir registriert, ein von zwei Zimmern sei noch nicht fertig (wir kamen gegen drei Uhr nachmittags an) aber wir könnten ja schon mal das Hotel besichtigen und das erste  Zimmer in Besitz nehmen. Taten wir auch, wurden freundlichst von einer Mitarbeiterin durchs Haus geführt um schliesslich in einem von zwei Zimmern zu landen. 
Die Aussicht ist wirklich phänomenal gewesen. Spektakulärer Blick vom Tibidabo auf Barcelona. 
Beim Öffnen der Fenster erschreckten wir uns zuerst über den herrschenden Lärm, er kam vom Rummel nebenan. Das wurde natürlich in keinem Reiseportal erwähnt, es gibt von Mittags an bis nach elf Uhr Nachts Freizeitpark-Betrieb mit ratternden Achterbahnen, lauten Fahrgeschäften und schreienden Vergnügungssuchenden. (Wie sich später herausstellte, ist der Park sogar älter als das Haus, daher auch die Schutzisolierung) Gut, dachten wir, die Fenster sind schallisoliert. Schade nur dass wir gerne bei offenem Fenster schlafen. 

Der zweite Schreck überkam uns bei näherer Betrachtung der Einrichtung dieses Zimmers. Die Böden, Vollholzparkett völlig zerkratzt vom Hin und Herschieben der Möbel, unverspachtelte Löcher an der Wand und dreckige Fenster. Die Kühlschrankbox in einem bemitleidenswerten Zustand mit ausgeschlagenen, ausgefransten Rändern. Auf der Bettdecke undefinierbare Flecken.
Das Bett in diesem Zimmer war gut, ein Queen Size Bed mit Boxspring Matratzen. Das Bad auch nett, Marmor und Sandstein mit großen Spiegeln und künstlicher Beleuchtung weil ohne Tageslicht und mit einer sehr schlechten Entlüftung, was in den Folgetagen immer wieder zu extremer Geruchsbelästigung (Gestank wie Gulli) führte.
Wir warteten nun in diesem Zimmer für fast eine Dreiviertelstunde auf 1. unsere Koffer, 2. den Zimmerschlüssel für das zweite Zimmer. Beides kam nicht, auch nicht nach wiederholtem Anruf beim Concierge. Man war jedesmal sehr apologetisch, alles kommt gleich, jaja, aber das Zimmer nebenan ist eben noch nicht fertig usw. 

Ich bin dann auf dem Flur dem Zimmermädchen begegnet, die mir völlig perplex mitteilte, dass das zweite Zimmer schon Stunden fertig wäre. Daraufhin ist meine Frau entnervt in die Lobby gefahren (wir hatten Hunger und wollten an den Pool. Geht aber ohne Badeklamotten nicht) um dort persönlich mit dem Manager zu sprechen. Sie traf unten unsere Koffer an, einen Menschen der gerade dabei war, sie zu verladen um sie auf ein anderes Zimmer als unseres zu schicken. Aber erst nachdem er eine andere Fuhre erledigt hätte. Das verbat sie ihm, was dazu führte dass  unser Gepäck zuerst nach oben gebracht wurde, wo sich dann in unserem zweiten  Zimmer das  Gepäck anderer Gäste auffand, was dort anstelle unserer Koffer deponiert worden war. Da waren wir schon sehr geladen. 

Beim anschliessenden Aufenthalt am Pool erschraken wir uns wegen der Preise für Tapas und andere Poolbar- Kleinigkeiten. Wir haben für drei kleine Tapas und zwei Tee sowie eine Fanta mehr als 60 Euro bezahlt. Nebendem, dass die Qualität und Quantität der dargereichten Nahrung nicht als sonderlich aussergewöhnlich beschrieben werden kann, war das dünkelhafte Verhalten der Bediensteten ein schwerer Schock für uns. Man ignorierte uns nach bestem Wissen und ich hatte wiederholt das Gefühl, dass wir völlig unwichtig wären. Selbst die Rechnung wurde mir erst nach mehrmaligen Bitten präsentiert. Das geht gar nicht.
Habe ich schon erwähnt dass dies ein Fünf- Sterne- Hotel ist?
Der Room Service am nächsten Morgen war sichtlich überfordert, er brauchte eine Dreiviertelstunde um uns zwei Tee zu bringen. Das war eine überflüssige Entschuldigung zu viel.

In unserem 2. Zimmer wiederholte sich übrigens das Muster aus dem anderen Zimmer. Auch hier die Böden verkratzt, die Kühlschrankkombi demoliert, der eingebaute Wandschrank aussen verschmiert mit dreckigen Fingerabdrücken, Löcher in der Wand, nicht gestrichen und die Fenster schwer zu öffnen und mit abblätterndem Lack versehen. Das Bad sehr luxuriös, groß mit Tageslicht und grandioser Aussicht auf Barcelona. Aber auch hier wieder Klogeruch, nicht zu beseitigen.
Keine Frage, das Haus ist alt. Aber es wurde 2003 komplett saniert und renoviert. Es sollte also eigentlich noch in einem guten Zustand sein. Den haben wir nur in der Lobby vorgefunden. Überall sonst herrschte eine deprimierende Vernachlässigung. Das Haus wird bevorzugt gebucht als Hochzeitsort von Barceloniern, das durften wir auch erleben. Dagegen ist nichts einzuwenden. Wogegen ich aber stark protestiere, ist dass alles von den Hochzeitsgästen in Beschlag genommen wird, die anderen Gäste daher zu Statisten degradiert werden und sich jede Unverschämtheit seitens der Hochzeitler (in unserem Falle war es eine Gruppe Kinder, die man mit infernalischen Schreien von ihren Nannies am Pool zu animieren versuchte, wo wir anderen Gäste unser Heil in Flucht gesucht hatten). es kümmert auch keinen vom Personal, ob wir dadurch einen Nachteil haben. Ganz offensichtlich ist dem Personal das Geschäft mit den Spaniern (KATALANEN) wichtiger. Die Wünsche aller anderen Hotelgäste wurden systematisch vernachlässigt. Man muss schon eine sehr dicke haut haben, um das akzeptieren zu können. 
Noch was zum Poolbereich: Dort gibt es Grand Lits, die auf angestrichenen Europaletten (!!!) liegen. Es reicht nicht mal für eine ordentliche Unterlage für die Poolbetten.
Das Frühstück war nicht im Preis inkludiert. Ich habe für drei Tage in diesem Haus 1.100 Euro für zwei völlig verwahrloste Zimmer bezahlt. Das Frühstück hätte noch einmal 32 Euro pro Person gekostet. Dank unseres Mietautos entschieden wir uns daher dankend für einen Besuch im Forn in Sarria, wo wir uns ordentlich satt essen konnten für ein Sechstel des aufgerufenen Preises.

Das Erlebnis dieses Aufenthalts endete mit dem Auschecken, wo wir wiederum erneut ignoriert wurden, bis ich mir die Freiheit nahm, eine Mitarbeiterin darauf hinzuweisen, dass wir fahren müssen. Da erbarmte sie sich. Ich war dann noch einmal und letztes Mal sauer, dass man ohne uns darüber vorher zu informieren, für jede Nacht fast zwanzig Euro für Valet Parking in Rechnung gestellt hatte. Das hätten wir auch anders machen können....
Zum Punkt Personalknappheit: Es ist nicht so, dass nicht genug Personal da war. Sie waren bloß alle miteinander beschäftigt. Ausserdem scheint es die mehrheitlich russischen Gäste nicht zu stören, so bedient zu werden. Das sagt eine Menge über den Sittenverfall in diesem Haus aus.
Ich habe mich am meisten über mich selbst geärgert, dass ich nicht einfach gegangen bin als das Drama anfing. Dummerweise hatte ich schon vorbezahlt um in den Genuss von 30% Ermässigung zu kommen. Diese Zimmer hätte also mehr als 200 Euro im Normalfall gekostet. Unglaublich!

Ich habe eine Liste von 10 Punkten zusammengestellt, was Erwartungen an spanische Hotels angeht. Vielleicht  hilft es ja dem geneigten Leser etwas.
10 goldene Regeln für spanische Hotels:

1. 5 Sterne in Spanien bedeuten nicht dasselbe wie 5 Sterne weltweit.
2. achte bei Buchungen darauf, dass Frühstück, bzw. der gewünschte Leistungsumfang inkludiert  ist.
3.bezahle nie im voraus. So kannst Du noch immer gehen, wenn es Dir nicht passt. 
4. schau Dir die Örtlichkeit vorher genau an, passt es zu deinen Wünschen?
5.Schau nach versteckten Kosten-> Valetparking!
6.mach klar, was du willst, freundlich und mit Nachdruck!
7. sei dir bewusst, dass du dem Hotel egal bist. Der Druck kommt vom Geldbeutel.
8.du hast kein Recht darauf, vom Hotel gut behandelt zu werden. Wirst du gut behandelt, liegt es an der Person, nicht am Hotel. Siehe Punkt 7.
9. sei kritisch. Weise das Personal auf Missstände hin. Das gibt ihnen Gelegenheit es zu bessern oder ändern.
10.checke die negativen TA Kommentare. Kleinigkeiten im Einzelfall addieren sich zu unangenehmen Erfahrungen im Total und in der Rückblende.",2,2013,08,27
28,Cócteles bajo cero,"La calidad de los cócteles es muy baja. En un pasado había visitado con cierta frecuencia la terraza desde donde se puede contemplar una espectacular  vista de Barcelona, sobretodo en una noche de verano con estrellas.El pasado sábado regresé de nuevo  con mi esposa para recordar y disfrutar de un entorno tan agradable. La decepción fue total. Pocas veces había bebido unos cócteles tan insultos y mal preparados. Con la categoría que se le supone al hotel no puede admitirse servir unos cócteles que desmerecerían el prestigio de cualquier coctelería.",2,2013,08,26
28,Una succesión de molestias,"Hola, 

Cogí una oferta de una noche romántica en este hotel. Llamé varias veces para reservar y ya empezó mal...Me tenían que devolver las llamadas para confirmar la disponibilidad: no lo hicieron. Volví a llamar varias veces, y por fin hablo con ""Reservas"" que me comenta que no se había reservado y que sería mejor que viniéramos durante un día de semana porque les va mejor (ellos deciden cuando el huésped se quiere alojar??...que morro! ).

Consigo ir un fin de semana después de una discusión larga con la operadora.

Llegamos y nos hicieron un upgrade: nos fuimos a una suite Deluxe con vistas a la montaña. La habitación muy grande, y muy fría (aires acondicionado a tope), vista a un árbol + cámara de vigilancia + parking, suelos de parquet rallados, paredes golpeadas, el aire acondicionado de la habitación ruidoso, espejo del baño sin funcionar y si lo tocabas si podía caer. 

Llega la hora del baño romántico con cava y bombones, todo junto (confirmado al hacer el check-in). Cuando llegamos a la habitación, solo teníamos el baño preparado. Llamamos para pedir el resto y nos contestan “enseguida”.  20 Min más tarde (baño enfriándose – no íbamos a bañarnos y salir del baño para abrir la puerta al room service que venía con el cava – decidimos esperar a tenerlo todo), volvimos a llamar y la chica nos contesta que hay que esperar más…mientras tanto, se enfría el baño…por fin, llega room service que se quedó hablando y contando su vida durante 5 min y nosotros con ganas de tomar nuestro baño romántico…

Salimos del baño y nos damos cuenta de que hay un charco (literalmente) de agua en el suelo de la entrada. Agua del aire acondicionado de la entrada, caía del techo por la bombilla de luz (peligroso…). Llamamos para que alguien de mantenimiento viniera. Esperamos un poco y nadie vino. Al ir a  cenar, lo recordamos a la entrada.  Volvimos de cenar, entramos a la habitación, y todo igual...suelo mojado, gotera…llamamos otra vez y recepción comenta que no sabe nada y lo va a preguntar …devuelven la llamada a los 2 min…(por primera vez, cumplen con la palabra!) y comentan que ya estaba reparado (MENTIRA!) al cual contestamos que si está reparado, entonces podían haber limpiado… resulta que sigue goteando y volvemos a llamar, y nos proponen cambiar de habitación (eran las 12h de la noche) y nos dan la suite Sky Terrace vistas a la montaña.

La verdad es que la habitación y las vistas eran muy bonitas. Lo único es que solo habían hecho la cama. La habitación estaba sucia (y la chica del check out reconoció el día siguiente cuando nos fuimos, que no tuvieron tiempo de limpiarla): que fuerte!
Para estar tranquilos pongo el cartel “no molestar”. 

El día siguiente, bajamos al bufet - comida muy regular: jamón malo y cortado grueso – unos 2mm - churros duros, kiwi, melón sin sabor, y los platos vacíos. Tardaron 10 min en reponer comida ya que la gente les estaba pidiendo.
 
Volvimos a subir y estaba un chico tocando la puerta (el cartel seguía puesto). Le preguntamos “Que hace aquí, está el cartel?, y contesta que venía para el mini bar. La verdad es que el cartel se había girado… y lo volví a girar delante de sus ojos…”no molestar”.
Aprovechamos la terraza y nos pusimos a tomar el sol y de repente tocan la puerta otra vez, con el cartel puesto al cual contestamos que “no” e entra un chico para buscar un carrito…con el cartel puesto y nosotros DESNUDOS… un Horror…

Nos vamos…

Al llegar a casa me doy cuenta de que me olvide de mis pendientes. Llamo al hotel, nadie contesta, vuelvo a llamar y el chico comenta que ahora lo miran y me dicen algo. A la hora, vuelvo a llamar… nadie contesta… a la 1h30 vuelvo a llamar…misma historia, espero 3h y voy a dormir… el día siguiente, ninguna noticia. Les mando un correo a las 9h, ninguna contestación. A las 16h vuelvo a llamar, y me dicen que lo han mirado en la segunda habitación y nada. Le comento que era en la primera y le mando un correo con las indicaciones de donde los dejé (al irnos tan rápido, me olvidé…) y pregunto por el director. Me ponen en espera. Dsps de 10 min esperando, decido llamar por el otro tel y me contesta una chica diciendome que se cortó la otra línea y que habían perdido mi número y me habían mandado un mail… al cual le comento que todavía estoy al teléfono con el otro número y que sigo en espera y que el mail no lo recibí... Por fin, me pasan con alguien (la room service manager, no el director…) y otra vez a explicar…

El día siguiente - por fin, una persona profesional - me devuelve la llamada y me dice que NO los han encontrado… me los han ROBADO ya que donde estaban puesto no podían caer ni al suelo ni en la pica… 

Resumen de este experiencia: un fin de malo, con muchas molestias, una incomodidad tremenda, personal falso y poco profesional  – lo que tenía que ser un fin de romántico, impresionante se transformó en una muy mala experiencia. Viajo mucho e este hotel NO vale sus 5 estrellas GL. No lo recomiendo a nadie. Mejor ir al Arts o Wela en Barcelona.
Gracias y Saludos,",2,2013,08,08
28,"traumhafte lage, bedingt für Städtetrip","uns hat das gran hotel la florida sehr gefallen. angefangen von einem fantastischen empfang und ein traumhaftes zimmer kann man weit ab von allem etwas die seele baumeln lassen. taxi ins zentrum kostet ca 15 - 20 EUR; an Flughafen haben wir 45 EUR bezahlt. Einzig negativ waren die etwas happigen preise im restaurant, die meines erachtens nicht gerechtfertigt sind. zum relaxen für 1-2 tage vor oder nach einer cruise oder eines auftenhalt in barcelona ist das hotel ideal !",5,2013,07,23
28,Bonito Hotel,"Estuvimos la noche de fin de año. El personal del hotel fue correcto y profesional, tuvimos algun problema a la hora de hacer la reserva, pero supongo que fue por reservar en una fecha algo especial. La habitación era muy bonita y correcta para un hotel 5*, pero algo justo para un 5* GL. Basicamente el GL lo adquiere gracias a sus vistas, que son espectaculares. Nuestra habitacion se encontraba en la 1 planta y justo en frente había una carretera, pero había escaso trafico. En general creo que es un buen hotel.",4,2013,06,24
28,Hotel aceptable... si fuese de 3 estrellas,"Tenía muy buenas referencias y expectativas sobre este hotel de 5 estrellas GL (dicen). Para empezar hay que reconocer que el personal es muy atento, no parecen tener la culpa de la crítica que voy a hacer. Fui con mi pareja a este hotel con la intención de descansar y disfrutar del supuestamente magnífico spa. Logramos descansar, la habitación cumplió nuestras expectativas. Pero el spa es, como comenta alguien más por aquí, MUY MALO. Increíblemente malo para un 5 estrellas GL!!! Efectivamente la piscina estaba demasiado fría, me es igual si estaba a 27º o no: estaba fría! La ""sauna"" era una porquería, no llegaba a 30º cuando se supone que las saunas están a 80-90º y son para sudar y abrir los poros, 5 estrellas GL!! En las tumbonas para relajarse no se podía estar mucho rato, te pelabas de frío. No pudimos entrar en el jakuzzi porque estaba repleto de gente que hacía turismo por Barcelona... hasta que al final nos hartamos y nos apretamos dentro: pues muy bien, un jakuzzi normal y corriente, pequeñito y casi a oscuras estábamos. Después de la decepción del spa fuimos a cenar por la noche para corroborar la bajísima relación calidad-precio del bar (baja por el alto precio, la calidad era aceptable). No quisimos arruinarnos en el restaurante l'Orangerie de platos carísimos y menú degustación de 72 € (creo recordar), ya que las críticas iban por el mismo camino...

A decir verdad, me dio la sensación de estar en un hotel de 3 estrellas caro. Me sorprendió mucho que este hotel sea calificado de 5 estrellas, con la coletilla-rintintín Gran Lujo (GL)...",2,2013,06,10
28,5 estrellas con vistas espectaculares a barcelona,"Vivo en Barcelona, ayer me aloje en este hotel y seguro que volvere! Las vistas son de las mejores que hay sobre la ciudad. Buscaba un ohtel que me permitiera salir de la ciudad sin ir muy lejos, estar servida como un 5 estrellas, y relajarme en un paisaje bonito, y lo consegui todo! La zona de la piscina/jardin esta muy bien diseñada en escaleras para que pueda tomar el sol sin sensacion de estar amontonado alrededor de mucha gente. La piscina en si, es climatizada asi que aun siendo junio nos bañamos sin problemas! y la piscina se inicia en el spa y sale fuera del hotel, super original! 

La habitacion, estuvimos en la junior suite 502, en la quinta planta, en el torreon, vistas ciudad. Recomendaria la segunda planta ya que tienen los grandes ventanales. En la tercera planta las habitaciones tienen balcon/terraza. En la cuarta tienen balcon pequeñito, y en la quinta no tienen. El baño es precioso, la ducha de 1,5 m cuadrados, enorme, y todo de marmol muy bonito! Es cierto que podrian mejorar detalles que con el uso se han ido desgastando, pero el edificio del hotel, antiguo de prinicipios de siglo, da un encanto diferencial. Y ademas no es un hotel muy grande, asi que no llegas a sentir que estas rodado de mucha gente.

La comida, cenamos en l'oragerie y comimos en el bar, mi opinion  es que hcen mucho mejor los platos de carne que el resto. Para los de carne la calidad precio es correcta, para los otros seria un poco caro. El postre de chocolate de l'orangerie, espectacular!

Muy recomendable para escapada romantica, con servicio de 5 estrellas, y vistas increibles!",5,2013,06,09
28,Relax a un paso de la ciudad,"Estuve en este hotel 1 noche en navidades. La decoración es preciosa y acogedora. Mi habitación con vistas a la ciudad muy recomendable, aunque se están quedando algo antiguas.
A destacar: el spa, incluído en el precio de la habitación. También el descanso que se encuentra tanto en el hotel como en los alrededores (un paseo precioso).
No me gustó el desayuno, demasiado caro para lo que ponen. 
Está lejos del centro, pero es ideal para los que quieren escapar de la ciudad sin tener que ir demasiado lejos.",4,2013,06,04
28,"Solo merece la pena la atencion del personal, lo demas de hotel de 3 estrellas","Estuve alli durante 4 dias, ni que decir tiene que no es barato; las vistas desde la terraza espectaculates y el servicio del hotel perfecto; las habitaciones son grandes pero las chicas de la lim`pieza un desastre. Lo peor de todo con diferencia...el catering del hotel, por que yo creo que alli no tienen ni cocineros, la comida realmente malisima, el vino mediocre y el precio del menu a ese nivel...una estafa. En el desayuno faltaba de reponer siempre algo y cuando lo sacaban era en bandejas envueltas en papel film...No volveria nunca",2,2013,05,20
28,"Localizacion increible, hotel decepcionante","El hotel tiene infinidad de posibilidades, el edificio y la ubicación que son geniales así lo demuestran.

Es normal que ya hace algunos años que no sea un GL. ya que la atención a los detalles esta totalmente descuidada. El servicio es bastante correcto pero no con la excelencia que se espera de un establecimiento de este tipo.

El peor spa en el que hemos estado con diferencia, solo tiene una piscina donde el agua estaba bastante fría y poco mas, el día que nos hospedamos tuvimos la mala suerte de encontramos con una familia entera con sus múltiples niños pequeños, corriendo, salpicando y gritando por todo el spa, ninguno de los empleados les llamo la atencion, ni hiceron nada para que los demás huéspedes disfrutáramos de la tranquilidad que se supone un spa ofrece; una experiencia mala como pocas que recuerde.

El restaurante tiene una relación calidad precio pésima y una carta pretensiosa, que deja bastante que desear.

Lo mejor del hotel las vistas y la hamburguesa de buey, es decir que no vale la pena alojarse en el, pero si subir a pasar la tarde.",3,2013,05,03
28,cattiva comunicazione,"arrivato giovedi sera: descrizione di una magnifica piscina e spa. venerdi e sabato piscina e spa chiusi per un evento privato (!)
arrivato giovedi sera: descrizione del ristorante oramgerie come luogo magnifico per cenare: prenoto venerdi per la sera stessa e riconfermo la prenotazione nel pomeriggio: arrivo a cena con mia moglie: solo panini e snack, nienete servizio ristorante perche' c'' un evento privato
sabato mattina: ordino la colazione in camera alle 10: arriva alle 11,30 e pure sbagliata

trattamento ridicolo",1,2013,04,27
28,Me esperaba un hotel mejor,"Me aloje en el hotel por una boda que tenia en el mismo. La boda muy bien, aunque fue tipo cocktail pero todo muy rico.
La ubicación es buena si se quiere tener buena panoramica de Barcelona pero mala si se quiere hacer turismo ya que esta a 20-25 minutos del centro de barcelona.
Estuve en la suite 603 y es una habitacion preciosa pero a falta de limpieza ya que las ventanas que daban al exterior y que eran de facil apertura necesitaban una buena limpieza junto con el resto de los espejos del baño. Para ser un 5 estrellas gran lujo solo tenian gel, champu y crema en muestras de l'occitane pero ni  cepillo de dientes ni gorro de ducha ni nada..
El desayuno muy normalito, escaso en variedad pero no en cantidad.
El personal de recepcion y los camareros muy amables.
",5,2013,03,26
28,Desaprovechado,"Hotel precioso,situado al lado del Tibidabo,y con una vistas de Barcelona a sus pies maravillosas,sin duda lo mejor.Un hotel hecho con elementos de calidad,muy logrados,pero un tanto abandonados ( rozaduras por reparar,tarima de madera sin pulir,etc )
Les falta el ""detalle"" que todo 5* GL debe tener,como son flores o el simple bombón al llegar a la habitación, o cuando se sabe del aniversario, ofrecer la botella de cava...
Servicio amable,habitación ámplia,pero faltaba lápiz,solo había jabón y champú para una persona,sin gorro para ducha,sin agua gratis para beber etc.
El desayuno,con un bufet muy justo,pero esto si,los productos de calidad.
Se salva por el lugar,pero no es un 5 GL,ni de lejos",3,2013,03,20
28,Excelente pero fallan pequeños detalles,"Es un hotel excelente, destaca por encima de todo las excelentes vistas, algo que lo hace distinto y especial, pero al ser un Gran Lujo es inevitable fijarse en los detalles, que todo esté perfecto y hay pequeños aspectos que defraudan. En nuestro caso : tuvimos que pedir la copa de cava de bienvenida que entra en la reserva, no nos la dieron por iniciativa propia. Nos dijeron que nos subirian las maletas pero no llegaron a la habitación hasta 1 hora después y las tuvimos que reclamar a recepción. El Spa es correcto pero incompleto, en invierno sólo puedes utilizar el jacuzzi porque la piscina es de agua fria y sin chorros. No comimos en el restaurante porque las críticas eran muy abundantes por la mala relación calidad-precio, por tanto, preferimos no arriesgarnos. 
Por lo demás, un hotel encantador, que todo y los pequeños fallos, acabas teniendo la sensación de haber disfrutado de algo diferente, romántico y bucólico... te aporta paz y eso os puedo asegurar que hará que paseis por alto el resto de detalles mejorables...",4,2013,03,15
28,Un sogno,"Sono stato varie in questo favoloso hotel, e posso dirvi che è come vivere un sogno.

Mi marido reservó el paquete san Valentín y disfrutamos mucho. El hotel es muy romántico perfecto para una escapada en pareja.
La piscina impresionante y el bar hace muy buenos cocteles. Nos dieron una mesa con vistas a la ciudad y la comida muy buena.
El personal también muy atento. Queremos volver en verano para disfrutar de la terraza que tiene.",5,2013,03,12
28,Maravilloso!!,"Hemos escogido La Florida porque amigos nos aconsejaron.
Las habitaciones tienen vistas impresionantes a la ciudad. El personal nos ha mimado mucho desde la llegada, en el restaurante y en el spa.

Volveremos pronto!",5,2013,03,12
28,Sensationelle Aussicht und (meist) sehr freundliches Personal,"Wir waren im Februar 2013 für 5 Tage in Barcelona und haben für unseren Städtetrip das La Florida ausgesucht. Das Hotel ist eines der Besten in Barcelona - und die Lage einzigartig. Wir haben im Zimmer 411 übernachtet, welches mit 2 Balkonen ausgestattet ist und eine sehr schöne Stadt / Meer-Sicht bietet. Das Bad ist ebenfalls sehr schön und sehr gross. Für 2 Personen so richtig angenehm ;) Für reine Städtereisende ist das La Florida allerdings wegen der Distanz zum Zentrum (Taxi €20) nur bedingt empfehlenswert. Vor allem in den wärmeren Monaten lässt es sich aber im grosszügigen SPA-Bereich hervorragend chillen und auf der Terrasse die Aussicht geniessen ... Das Hotelpersonal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.

Einzige Abstriche mussten wir beim Frühstück machen. Dieses ist überteuert und das Personal war entweder schlecht gelaunt oder schlicht unaufmerksam und unfähig, die Bestellungen richtig aufzunehmen.",4,2013,02,26
28,decepcionado,"me esperaba otra cosa de un hotel de 5 estrellas gran lujo, he salido igual que he entrado,no me he sentido acgido, si muy buena recepcion personalizada pero no,habitaciones frias pero frias con todo la calefaccion no habia manera de poder subirla y la habitacion en si, he estado en otros de muchas menos estrellas y mejores, desayuno normalito por los mas de 20 euros un atraco eso si zumo de naranja natural, solo faltaria en 5  estrellas pero el resto  nada del otro mundo. decepcionado,
y un ruego si van a este hotel, no les dejen que le aparquen el coche, parece mentira que un hotel de esta categoria no se enteren de que los retrovisores pueden ser electricos  a mi no me la han roto pero casi, los han forzado con las manos para abrirlos inandmisible, no volvere",3,2013,02,10
28,In die Jahre gekommen...,"Ich habe geschäftlich eine Nacht im La Florida verbracht. Die Architektur des Hotels hat mir sehr gut gefallen, ist doch der alte Bau mit neuen Elementen kombiniert worden, was den besonderen Reiz ausmacht. Leider wurde aber schon seit längerer Zeit nicht mehr Hand angelegt und langsam ist das Hotel in die Jahre gekommen. Die Zimmer sind zwar geräumig und es gibt keine Spannteppiche, sondern Parkettfußboden, allerdings ist die Einrrichtung nicht mehr zeitgemäß. In meinem Zimmer fehlte ein Abfalleimer (sowohl im Schlafraum als auch im Badezimmer), der auch nicht gebracht wurde, nachdem ich das Hotelpersonal darauf aufmerksam gemacht habe. Der große Flatscreen im Zimmer ist zwar toll, allerdings ist er stümperhaft mit einem Draht an der Wand fixiert, noch dazu an jener Wand, an der auch der Regler für die Klimaanlage angebracht ist, sodass man diese nicht erreichen kann. 
Positiv zu erwähnen ist die fantastische Aussicht auf Barcelona, die ihresgleichen sucht. Für einen Städtetrip würde ich das Hotel nicht empfehlen, da es einfach zu weit vom Zentrum entfernt ist. Schade jedenfalls, dass man ein ursprünglich wirklich tolles Hotel so verkommen lässt!",3,2013,02,05
28,perfecto para desconectar,"perfecto para desconectar, el hotel es precioso y las vistas impresionantes. un gran hotel, con las instalaciones, el spa, la piscina preciosa. Incluso para una escapada dentro de bcn., se renovan las energias.Tambien muy agradable para hacer un desayuno.... El servicio si es bastante lento, pero muy amables. Lo unico que no es nada bueno y no vale la pena, incluso diria malo es el restaurante L'orangerie, mejor optar por las hamburguesas!!!",5,2013,02,03
28,Semplicemente fantastico !,"Ho soggiornato al Grand Hotel La Florida per festeggiare il mio compleanno, che dire tutto splendido! Camera con vista, accoglienza con lo Champagne, servizio ottimo e camere curate in ogni minimo dettaglio, la piscina sia esterna che interna, ideale quindi per le giornate un pò nuvolose, la SPA ... un paradiso !! La colazione è molto ricca con un ottima scelta e varietà sia dolce che salato. Il personale è stato molto attento e sempre disponibile. Che altro dire.... ritorneremo !",5,2013,01,29
28,Espectacular! superando expectativas !,"He salido esta mañana del hotel.. no quería dejar la habitación! IMPRESIONANTE ! 
Quise hacer un regalo a mi novio por nuestro aniversario y reservé una habitación en este hotel Sin duda no me ha decepcionado! Llame unos días antes para preguntar unas dudas sobre las habitaciones y además me recomendaron una que decían que era buena, y así ha sido.. unas vistas impresionantes! El personal excelente! Incluso me ayudaron a montar la sorpresa a mi novio actuando para que no se enterara de nada !! La hab perfecta, amplia y limpia y el resto del hotel a la altura de un 5* GL.
La única pega.. el desayuno.. todo esta bien servido y puesto con gracia y tal pero esperaba que fuera más completo... aún así no estuvo mal aunque 28 eur lo he encontrado excesivo.. y cuando llamé días antes me dijeron 20 eur aprox??! se disculparon por la información errónea y no entré más en el tema ya que por todo lo demás se habian comportado muy bien conmigo.
Recomiendo este hotel! tanto por su ubicación y instalaciones como por la amabilidad de todo el personal! estuvimos muy a gusto! 
Trabajo en un hotel y suelo fijarme mucho en todo cuando voy a uno.. de hecho me fijo en todos los posibles errores!!! y La Florida sin duda me ha dejado sin palabras! Gracias por todooooo !",5,2013,01,21
28,Maravilloso,"Simplemente he de decir que es un lugar dentro de barcelona en el cual te puedes sentir aislado y disfrutar de sus instalaciones, incluso para pasar el dia es magnifico!  Las habitaciones son amolias y super acogedoras, comodas y con unas vistas a la ciudad asi como a la montaña que te hace desconectar",5,2013,01,17
28,"Cuidado!!!!!
Las imagenes de las habitaciones de la web del hotel no coinciden en absoluto con la asignada en mi estancia","Me han asignado una habitación que nada tiene que ver con la solicitada !!!!Y PAGADA!!!  siendo de medidas mucho mas reducidas.
No hay servicio de alquiler de peliculas. Deberían avisar al formalizar la reserva.
En fin, no volvere, seguro.

28,Excelentes vistas desde el Tibidabo con un servicio 5 estrellas,"Impresiona la subida al hotel ya que es bastante pronunciada, pero una vez en el mismo, en plena colina del Tibidabo, y con unas vistas, literalmente espectaculares de la ciudad, sin embargo lo que más destacaría es el excelente servicio, la amabilidad del personal en todo momento, la tranquilidad que se respira en todas sus instalaciones, y su excelente restaurante a la carta.. todo ello te hace sentir durante tu estancia como si estuvieras en tu propia casa.",5,2012,12,27
28,"SPA, Piscina y Gimnasio al nivel de los 5 Estrellas del Hotel",Es una de las mejores piscinas hoteleras de Barcelona y la unica en aluminio de la ciudad. El gimnasio recien renovado y la vista del restaurante hacen que este hotel sea una gran atractiva para fines de semana y reuniones de negocio.,5,2012,12,21
28,Decepcionante,"Había oído hablar mucho de este hotel así que llevé a mi pareja conmigo para un fin de semana relajante (otra cosa no, porqué está lejísimos de la ciudad). La impresión general es que de 5*GL nada de nada. 5 estrellas a lo sumo. Se promocionan con fotos que dan a entender que es un hotel moderno pero es totalmente clásico (si tenéis menos de 35 años no os va a gustar seguro, y si tenéis más dependerá de vuestro grado de exigencia). La habitación era muy pequeña para un hotel de gran lujo. Pedimos vistas de frente al mar pero la cama iba en paralelo con la única ventana de la habitación y sólo se veía parte de Barcelona y un montón de colinas. Tenías que salir a la mini terraza y mirar a un lado para ver el mar. Lo peor: el restaurante l'Orangerie. Sablazo en toda regla por unos platos que tardaron en servirnos lo que no está escrito. Y la decoración horrible: las mesas con manteles granates y blancos te transportan a un bar de principios de los noventa. La iluminación también era horrible. De verdad, el restaurante desentona con todo el hotel. Tendrían que cambiarlo de arriba abajo. Carta, decoración y precios. Al lado hay el longue del hotel con una carta más larga y decente, pero aún así mantiene unos precios carísimos. Personalmente no repetiré. Ni la calificación de gran lujo ni el precio se corresponden a lo que realmente es.",2,2012,12,05
28,Por un dia que salimos!!!!!,"He leido las criticas de trip advisor mientras estaba alojado, de hecho aun lo estoy... En mi experiencia, el servicio ha sido muy atento. Nos recibio Pau, nos dio una vuelta por el hotel antes de llegar a la habitacion, y debo decir q : MOLT BE!!  Luego nos atendio Julia, una joven germana, aprendiendo español, y tambien muy bien. La limpieza del hotel, y de nuestra habitacion, correcta. Sabanas i toallas limpias, baño limpio, perfecto!!
Las vistas, espectaculares, la terraza, un 10!! No hemos disfrutado del spa esta vez, con lo q no puedo evaluarlo. 
El restaurant, si es cierto q los precios son muy caros, pero son acordes con un 5GL...  Todos los platos y los vinos tienen Dos cifras, con lo cual , por poco q pidas sales a 120 euros por pareja. Pero, por un dia q salimos!!!!!   
Se puede repetir,

Josep farreres",4,2012,11,10
28,Top Hotel für alle die Barcelona bereits kennen,"Das Hotel hat einen einzigartigen Standort, direkt oberhalb im Rücken von Barcelona gelegen, auf dem Tibidabo. Dieser Ausblick auf Barcelona ist wundervoll. Die Ruhe des Hotels ausserhalb der Hauptsaison (wenn kein Vergnügungspark geöffnet hat)und die sehr geräumigen, schön ausgestatteten Zimmer sind großartig.
Wichtig: Immer einen Mietwagen für den Aufenthalt nutzen. Die Entfernung zur Rambla oder Placa Catalunya sind ca. 20 Minuten mit dem Auto. Ein tolles Hotel mit großzügigem Spa- und Wellnessbereich. Fazit: Wer Barcelona bereits gut kennt, dem bietet das Gran Hotel La Florida ein wenig Ruhe oberhalb der Stadt.",4,2012,10,11
28,5 Estrellas Gran Lujo,"Acabo de venir de pasar una noche en este hotel, regalo de mi hija por mi 50 cumplaños, ya que desde mi infancia cuando tuve constancia de que era un hotel y enamorada de mi ciudad siempre quise pasar una noche y contemplar la ciudad. Por eso con referencia al precio de la habitación, desayuno y parquing no hablaré de precios ya que es un regalo y es de mala educación mirar el precio. Lo que si os puedo decir es que 2 tequila sunrise por la tarde en el bar y una cena en la habitación compuesta por una botella de cava, una botella grande de agua, un entrecot, un sandwich de pollo, bacon, ensalada, tomate y mayonesa (estaba buenisimo) y dos postres nos ha costado unos 170 euros. El hotel precioso una edificación sobre la montaña de Collcerola al lado del Tibidabo del año 1929. Las vistas maravillosas, pero ya os he dicho que adoro mi ciudad, mi hija nos cogió una habitación con salita y nos dieron una que hacia esquina, por lo que tambien teniamos la vista trasera, desde donde veiamos las montañas de Montserrat. El baño una bañera grande y una ducha enorme, albornoz y zapatillas. Servicio de prensa en cada planta. Desayuno mediterráneo, el embutido de muy buena calidad, diferentes clases de pan y como es tradicional en Cataluña, tomates para poder hacer ""pa amb tomàquet"", y bolleria. Bueno que si se puede pagar os lo recomienendo.",5,2012,09,30
28,Una panorámica increíble.,"Sólo tuve el placer de disfrutar de sus instalaciones durante un día entero (SPA, Restaurante, Terraza y hamacas). Conseguí una estupenda promoción a través de una página de terceros a un precio muy competitivo.

Las vistas y la panorámica a la ciudad de Barcelona son impresionantes. En cuánto al aparcamiento, tuve la suerte de encontrar en las cercanías del hotel pegado a la carretera.

El trato del personal fue correcto y amable en todo momento. La verdad sea dicha, me quedé con ganas de estar alojado en una de sus habitaciones.

En cuánto al SPA, pues estuve muy a gusto. Relax, tranquilidad en su medida. Logras desconectar de todo durante unas horas y cumple con su cometido a la perfección.

Eso sí, en cuánto al bar-restaurante exterior, los precios son desorbitados. No tengo ninguna queja referente a la comida que disfruté en el día que estuve, es más, fue todo delicioso. Pero considero que los precios tanto de bebida como de comida en plan de ""tapeo"" son demasiado elevados.

Evidentemente, cuando vas a un 5* GL, sabes que te encuentras este tipo de precios y servicio, pero no está de más destacar que por una mera botella de agua o refresco pagues 2 veces más de lo normal.

Si tengo la oportunidad en adelante, quizá me escapo de nuevo. Pero esta vez, pernoctando.",4,2012,09,28
28,Muy lejos de un buen hotel,"Había oído malas críticas pero quería darle una oportunidad. El hotel es muy bonito y sobretodo por las vistas que ofrece pero el servicio es lamentable, peor de lo que hubiera imaginado y por ello no puede merecer la categoría que tiene este establecimiento. Personal no cualificado (parece que deben pagar muy poco lo que dista mucho del precio que cobran por sus servicios), comida malísima y lejos de ser propia de un hotel 5*GL. El hotel en si es bonito y sus vistas pero podrían poner más amenities en el baño (por favor, es un 5*!) y si no se puede cambiar, al menos tratar de disimular las rozaduras de su mobiliario. Me da mucha pena que un hotel así se suponga sea de los mejores de la ciudad.",2,2012,08,14
28,Dominare Barcelona,"Siamo stati per 3 giorni in questo hotel. Che dire? Tutto di gran lusso. All'arrivo ti offrono lo Champagne. La vista è magnifica, soprattutto se nuoti nella piscina a sfioro e guardi tutta Barcelona. Abbiamo avuto la fortuna di pagare una camera fronte montagna ed averne una fronte mare (potere di Booking.com!!). Fantastica!!!. La camera spaziosissima ed il bagno altrettanto. Bagno turco ed idromassaggio ok, ma la sauna era a 110°, non praticabile. L'unica pecca è che si è a circa 12 Km dal centro di Barcelona (circa 20 Euro di taxi a tratta). C'è comunque un pulmann che va da Placa Catalunya al parco divertimenti di Tibidabo. Noi ci siamo attrezzati con scooter e devo dire è stata una mossa azzeccata: è bellissimo e facile da girar; scopri veramente tutta la città. Altrra nota un po' negativa è la vicinanza con il parco giochi: durante il giorno si sentono i rumori e le urla della gente.",4,2012,07,25
28,Sehr schön - und gleich wieder gebucht.,"Das Hotel ist optimal für eine Städtereise. Sensationeller Blick auf Barcelona und das Mittelmeer. Immer ein paar erholsame Grad kühler als in der Hitze der Stadt und immer ein wenig Wind. Taxifahrt unproblematisch (ca 20 bis 25 Minuten). Ich war mit meinem Sohn in einer unglaublich schönen Turmsuite (upgrade) dort und habe gleich für Oktober für meine fünfköpfige Familie zwei nebeneinanderliegende Terrassen-Suiten mit Verbindungstüre gebucht.

Die Preise sind einem der ""Leading Hotels of the World"" angemessen und üblich. Wen das stört, sollte hier nicht buchen.

Der Service ist sehr gut. Fast jeder Wunsch wird erfüllt. Nur einer (noch) nicht:

Abends hat man theoretisch drei Gelegenheiten, draußen im Hotelgarten über der Stadt zu Essen: Sehr schöne Tapas an der Bar, fast jeden Abend Barbecue und im Restaurant. Allerdings neigt das Restaurant leider hartnäckig dazu, seine Terrasse selbst dann geschlossen zu halten - angeblich wegen des Windes, auch wenn der nur lau ist -, wenn es kein Barbecue gibt und ""nur"" die Bar aufhat. Selbst dringende Wünsche helfen da nicht. Das ist eine Zumutung und muß anders werden, denn wer will bei dieser Lage schon drin Essen? Allerdings: Die Tapas an der Bar und das Barbecue sind klasse und man kann sich einen schönen Platz im Garten mit freier Sicht auf Stadt und Meer suchen.

Besser kann man in einer Stadt nicht wohnen.

Ach ja: Das ab und an zu unrecht kritisierte Frühstück ist ganz prima, u.a. Champagner, frischer Orangensaft, das unvermeidliche Rührei, vor allem aber Landestypisches (Tapas, Gebäck etc.)  Nur wer schon beim Frühstück nicht unterscheiden können möchte, ob er in Berlin, Hamburg, Düsseldorf oder Frankfurt is(ß)t, wird sich hieran stören.",5,2012,06,29
28,empfehlenswert,"Das Hotel liegt auf dem Berg von dem zwar ganz Barcelona zu sehen ist (traumhaft!!), die Fahrt in die Stadt aber 20-30 Minuten mit dem Taxi in Anspruch nimmt. Man fühlt sich im Zimmer sofort sehr wohl. Platz, Ambiente, Ausblick, Ausstattung mit Anspruch auf Luxus.Traumhaftes Frühstücksraum mit autemberaubendem Ausblick. Es gibt allerdings leider keine Möglichkeit, vor 7.00 zu frühstücken, es sei denn man ist bereit 17 Euro für Kaffee und ein paar Kekse auszugeben, das aber auch frühestens um 6.30.",4,2012,06,24
28,Servicio lamentable,"No merece 5 estrellas ni desde luego la categoría de ""Gran Lujo"". De cuatro habitaciones hubo dificultades para hacer el check-in en tres (y eso que llevaban dos meses reservadas porque asistíamos a una boda), a otros invitados les asignaron habitaciones de otras reservas y finalmente nos dimos cuenta nosotros mismos con lo que simplemente registrarse a la llegada fue eterno (a los propios novios no les tenían la habitación preparada cuando llegaron...). En la cafetería de la piscina tardaron 1hora y media en servir y con la mitad de la comanda mal, por lo que parte de las personas se tuvieron que ir sin comer porque perdíamos un tren. Hubo problemas con las duchas y la ilumnación que no se subsanaron en dos días y desconocían cómo tramitar una denuncia por hurto que actuamente en Barcelona se pueden hacer desde el hotel se justificaron diciendo que  ""el compañero que hizo el curso entraba al día siguiente a las tres de la tarde"". Hay dificultades para que los taxis vayan a hacer un servicio a este hotel por la distancia por lo que hay que solicitarlos con antelación y tener suerte.

Hay muy poca profesionalidad y nadie se reponsabiliza de las constantes negligencias. Yo no vuelvo",1,2012,06,20
28,no merece ser un cinco estrellas,"Nos alojamos un fin de semana en una junior suite.
Salvo las vistas,el Hotel necesita a gritos una reforma.
Baños antiguos y estropeados.Spa descuidado y diria que hasta sucio.
El restaurante falto de servicio.Al haber una boda ruido hasta altas horas de la madrugada.
No creo que pueda sobrevivir si no se plantean una reforma a fondo.
Seria una pena desperdiciar el entorno.
El servicio lo intenta pero son pocos e inexpertos.
Una pena.NO volveria jamas ni lo recomendaria.
Como mucho seria un cuatro estrellas y mal cuidado.",2,2012,06,09
28,Estancia relajante,"Nos alojamos en enero de 2012 en este magnífico hotel.
La situación, junto al Tibidabo, hace que el desplazamiento desde y hacia la ciudad sea un recorrido que da cierta pereza, si bien es un hotel para disfrutarlo.
La conexión con la ciudad, además de coche propio o taxi, puede hacerse con los autobuses del parque del tibidabo (creo recordar de 9:00 a 17:00) y enlazan desde la puerta del hotel con la plaza Catalunya.
El hotel se alza imponente sobre la ciudad y tiene unas magnificas vistas hacia esta.
Las zonas comunes son agradables y decoradas de forma neutra.
La zona del bar, es relajante y está muy bien para tomarse una copa, tiene sillones confortables, si bien me pregunto que debe pasar si el hotel esta lleno, ya que en bien del confort y el espacio hay pocas plazas para disfrutarlo.
La zona del Spa está francamente bién con una piscina que se comunica con el exterior y zonas de sauna y baño turco. Muy relajante.
El restaurante me causo una grata impresión, tanto en la cocina como en la atención y espacios.
La habitación, con vistas impresionantes a la ciudad y mar, si que tenía algunos puntos que merecerían prestarles mayor atención, como puede ser el tejido del sofa un tanto desgastado y la solución de la televisión que no tenía la calidad que se merece el hotel.
El personal muy atento y el desayuno correcto, si bién eche en falta platos calientes.
Sin duda volveré a visitarlo.",5,2012,05,16
28,Tolles Grandhotel in spektakulärer Lage,"Dieses Haus ist ein wahres Luxushotel, sowohl was die Größe und Ausstattung der Zimmer betrifft als auch die Dienstbeflissenheit des Personals und die Ausstattung an Bars, Restaurants, Terrassen.

28,Un 5 stelle GL con GL di troppo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel durante il nostro viaggio a Barcellona alla fine di Marzo 2012.All'arrivo siamo rimasti stupiti favorevolmente dalla struttura:interni curati nei minimi dettagli ed eleganti!Dal nostro terrazzo si godeva la vista bellissima della città di Barcellona!La camera (Delux) era grande,i bagni con pietra dai colori naturali,enorme doccia da 4 metri quadri e addirittura la vasca,tutto insieme!.Tutto era perfetto.Bellissima la zona SPA,la piscina lunghissima in acciaio; interna ed esterna che rendeva i fine giornata, dopo le passeggiate a piedi per la città, molto gradevoli!
La nota un po negativa per i miei gusti è stata la colazione(io che la adoro) sicuramente non degna di 25 euro a testa!In 15 minuti nessuno ci è venuto a chiedere se volevamo latte,caffé o etc.La scelta delle paste (solo mignon e assolutamente non di pasticceria) era scarsissima.Cosi ce ne siamo andati.
Il costo del taxi variava da 16 a 20 euro.Una sera abbiamo preso il taxi chiamato dal hotel(la compagnia con cui lavorano loro) che ci ha fatto pagare 35 euro,il doppio!Ovviamente lo abbiamo referito al albergo dopo sperando che gli faranno la festa.
Non so se i problemi riscontrati siano un caso.Pero siamo rimasti relativamente contenti.",4,2012,04,08
28,Sablazo en las alturas,"Se nos ocurrió ir a visitar el hotel para una posible estancia y nos quedamos a comer. Personal no cualificado aunque con buena intención,  la camarera que nos atendió creo que no había descorchado una botella de vino en su vida, tardaron en servirnos una eternidad, se nos ocurrió pedir menú dado que la carta era muy escueta, y por 60€ por cabeza salimos con una tostadita con tomatitos muy bonitos, la carne de segundo debía de ser de una pobre vaca vieja, probablemente congelada en varias ocasiones y cocinada con poco acierto tras sacarla del microondas, nos quejarnos y nos volvieron a repetir la carne y tras media hora más nos volvieron a servir mas de lo mismo. El postre de menú de 10€, evitamos pedir café para evitar el dolor de estómago que nos produjo una cuenta de la que no tuvieron ni el detalle de deducir la carne que ni probamos.",1,2012,04,03
28,Auf der Höhe,"Gerne bin ich wieder bei meinem Besuch ins La Florida zurückgekehrt. Die Lage auf dem Hausberg samt Aussicht ist einfach nicht zu toppen. An- und Abreise benötigen etwas Planung, es sei denn man steigt ins Taxi, was besonders in den Abendstunden zu empfehlen ist. Der öffentliche Seilbahnverkehr samt Zubringerbus stellen für spanische Verhältnisse relativ früh am Abend den Service ein, besonders in den Wintermonaten. Reist man mit Kindern, freuen diese sich am Vergnügungspark in der Nähe. Die Zimmer sind allesamt ruhig und die Aussicht nochmals ""breathtaking"".",5,2012,04,03
28,Buon albergo ma lontano dalla città,"Prima di tutto - non è il posto più conveniente per i turisti. Si trova lontano dalla città e dal traffico rende ancora peggio. A parte di questo La Florida è un hotel molto buono, soprattutto quando si sceglie una stanza con vista sulla città. Edificio è vecchio, ma dentro tutto è bello e moderno. Vista perfetta significa che è un buon posto se volete visitare i luoghi in giro per Barcellona. Mi è piaciuto stare lì.",5,2012,03,31

28,Gran cama,"Ya escribi con anteriolridad una critica de este hotel,pero he visto una invitacion ha descubir a otros viajeros las mejores camas y sin duda alguna este,creo que es el punto mas positivo que encontre en este hotel.

28,Vergonzoso,"Ya no es lo que era.Siempre les quedaran la vistas a la ciudad. Fuimos a comer para celebrar un aniversario. Después de una hora en un comedor muertos de frío porque no sabían poner la calefacción les pedimos un cambio de mesa. Nos ponen de cualquier manera en una mesa fuera del comedor y de las vistas. En una sala de paso. Nos tienen media hora mas sin servir-nos. Para colmo cuando aparecen y nos sirven, el primer plato estaba frío. La mesa no tenia copas, ni agua, ni servilletas, ni pan. Solo un plato frío. Ante tal escándalo y reclamando la presencia de un responsable,el cual me reconoció que el servicio no estaba al nivel de la supuesta categoría del hotel, cogímos toda la familia y nos fuimos. Con la llegada a Barcelona de hoteles como el Mandarin Oriental o el Starwood ,que si que son de gran lujo ,La Florida  tiene los días contados . Con todo merecimiento.",1,2012,02,12

Il personale (TUTTO LO STAFF) si è dimostrato davvero accogliente, sorridente e cordiale.
La nostra stanza aveva una vista da togliere il fiato e la camera in sè era davvero meravigliosa, sia nell'arredamento che nella pulizia.
Abbiamo usufruito anche del centro benessere...un sogno.
Siamo stati benissimo, non solo per la struttura che sembra un po' un castello, ma anche eprchè, nonostante fosse un Grand Hotel, il personale era alla manoe  questo non ci ha fatto sentire a disagio.

Al hacer la reserva nadie nos indico que había un 50 cumpleańos y que iba durar toda la tarde-noche.

La habitacion enorme, nosotros estuvimos en una de luxe, con unas amplias vistas de la costa barcelonesa, y el Vallés, silenciosa y decorada en armonioso conjunto con el resto del hotel, limpia y funcional.

28,Stark nachgelassen,"Das Gran Hotel La Florida war einst eines der besten Hotels der katalanischen Hauptstadt. Leider hat sich dies mittlerweile geändert. Entweder fehlt das Geld oder die Liebe zum Detail, denn die Zimmer sind mittlerweile teils unansehnlich. Weit vom bisherigen Standard entfernt. Und auch die Leistung des Restaurants ist weit unter dem bisherigen Niveau. Aktuell ist das La Florida die Tarife, die es für ein Zimmer verlangt, nicht mehr wert.",3,2011,11,16
28,Barcellona ai tuoi piedi,"Da dove si gode la migliore vista panoramica su Barcellona? Dalla collina del Tibidabo, sopraelevata quel tanto che basta per ammirare l'intera città fino al porto e al mare. Al Tibidabo, non lontano da una chiesa e da un parco giochi, si trova il Gran Hotel La Florida, costruzione in vecchio stile che assomiglia ad un castello delle Alpi bavaresi e che da anni rappresenta uno dei simboli della dinamica città spagnola. E' la seconda volta in un anno che mi capita di essere ospitato in questo hotel e di conseguenza ho pensato di recensirlo per i lettori di Tripadvisor.
Premetto subito che è scomodo, nel senso che dal centro città occorrono almeno 20 minuti di taxi per arrivarci. E' il prezzo che si paga per avere in cambio un panorama straordinario. La struttura ha il fascino di quei vecchi alberghi un tempo sfarzosi oggi in po' appannati per via del logorio degli anni. Ha il pregio di essere diverso dalla gran parte degli hotel moderni che si assomigliano. Si capisce subito che ha un passato e che forse avrebbe bisogno di qualche intervento di manutenzione. Le camere però sono spaziose e con tante finestre: anche da letto si riesce ad ammirare il panorama sulla città. I bagni sono stati ristrutturati e dispongono di un ampio vano doccia molto funzionale: l'arredo e le poltrone sono un po' invecchiate, ma contribuiscono a creare una certa atmosfera.
Per chi vuole essere sempre collegato ad Internet c'è un wi-fi che funziona bene e ad alta velocità sia nelle parti comuni che nelle camere. Ed è gratuito.
Alla vecchia struttura alberghiera è stata aggiunta una parte nuova e moderna che si affaccia su un giardino, sempre con vista sulla città. Qui si trovano un bar all'aperto ed una piscina: si nuota ammirando Barcellona. Se il tempo fa le bizze, la stessa piscina ha una parte coperta al riparo dalle interperie. Non ho provato il ristorante, lui pure con una parete a vetri per continuare a vedere anche da tavola Barcellona dall'alto, ma posso assicurarvi che la colazione è di ottimo livello e devo immaginare cho lo sia anche il ristorante. Addetti gentili al ricevimento, poco personale in giro, ma di sera passa la cameriera ai piani per preparare la camera per la notte e per chiedere se avete bisogno di qualche cosa. Nel complesso mi sono trovato bene entrambe le volte ed ho apprezzato in particolare il silenzio che circonda le camere. L'unico difetto del Gran Hotel La Florida resta la sua lontananza dal cuore pulsante e godereccio della città. Ma se si vuole avere il panorama non si può pretendere di essere sulle Ramblas!

28,Hotel muy tranquilo con muy buenas vistas.,"Hotel lujoso y muy tranquilo, con personal muy atento y muchos servicios.
El hotel se encuentra alejado del centro de Barcelona, a unos 7/9 kilometros, eso puede ser algo bueno y algo malo. Bueno porque es muy tranquilo y no estas escuchando miles de coches y gente, como puede ser un hotel en la ciudad y malo por estar lejos del centro y tener que desplazarte hasta allí para ver tiendas o visitar lugares, por ejemplo ir en taxi puede salir algo caro.

La decoración esta muy bien conseguida, por lo menos en las zonas de recepción, salones de reuniones, restaurante y el bar, pero no tanto en las habitaciones.

Las habitaciones son muy grandes, con tv grande con canales de España e internacional y películas a la carta, aunque hay diferentes tipos de habitaciones, vista a la ciudad, vista montaña, con terraza, suites, etc. Recomiendo vista a la ciudad con balcón, cuidado por que no todas tienen balcón.

Gran piscina de acero ubicada en la zona de spa y el bar con vista a la ciudad.

El bar terraza tiene una zona chillout muy grande con muchas tumbonas.

Ahora resumen de las cosas negativas:

El precio por habitación me parece excesivo.

Nevera mini-bar muy pequeña que no enfría mucho con precios abusivos y absurdos, ejemplo botella pequeña de agua por 5 €.

La ""manía"" que tienen últimamente muchos hoteles de quitar la puerta del baño y poner una puerta corredera que no aísla nada y resta privacidad.

La TV plana es una chapuza, no se podía orientar bien hacia la cama, el colmo es que no tiene TDT y se veia fatal con franjas, la emisión al parecer es analógica no digital, olvida ver la MTV o La Sexta3 por ejemplo. La TV tiene un programa personalizado del hotel con un menú arcaico, donde puedes elegir TV, películas a la carta, juegos, etc. Pero bastante malo, por ejemplo una película a la carta cuesta 14 € ¡¡¡

En la habitación no ponen nada como detalle de bienvenida, ni agua ni cava ni algún bombón.

Precios abusivos en el desayuno, 28 € por persona. ( será para que nadie vaya).

Precios del restaurante y bar también abusivos, por curiosidad pregunte precio de una CocaCola; 5€. 

Si llevas coche particular y quieres dejarlo en el parking hay que pagar 21€ por día, precio carísimo y es inexplicable que quieran cobrar eso sabiendo que la zona es casi imposible estacionar, el colmo es que me di cuenta de un detalle, y es que en la parte trasera del hotel hay una acera donde se puede aparcar los coches pero el hotel a colocado pivotes en toda la acera que pertenece al hotel para que no lo puedas estacionar por allí, un poco mas abajo si se puede, pero por la noche no hay ninguna iluminación. Hay que tener poca vergüenza (directivos del hotel) para hacer esto y así cobrar el parking.",4,2011,10,07
28,"Un hotel perfecto, sabiendo que vas a 9 km. del centro.","El grueso de nuestras vacaciones lo pasamos en este hotel. Sin lugar a dudas una decisión acertadísima, gracias sobre todo a la oferta que conseguimos, ya que la tarifa oficial del mismo es desorbitada.

Teníamos claro a donde íbamos, ya que leo alguna critica respecto a la ubicación del mismo, en ningún momento dicen que estén en el centro de Barcelona, ni tan siquiera cerca, esta en el Tibidabo a unos 9 km. del centro de la ciudad, esto por supuesto tiene sus ventajas y sus inconvenientes.

Gracias al navegador llegamos sin ningún problema, como siempre la primera impresión cuenta, y desde luego que fue muy grata, aparcamos el coche en la puerta y de inmediato sale una persona de recepción a recogernos las llaves e invitarnos a realizar el check in.

El mismo se realiza en una mesa, no hay mostrador de recepción al uso, lo que hace mucho mas personal el tramite.

Nos atiende Sergi, un profesional como la copa de un pino, en todo momento nos informa de todo con celeridad, nos invita a una copa de bienvenida y nos acompaña para enseñarnos todas las instalaciones, en ese medio tiempo ya tenemos asignada la habitación y todas las maletas en la misma, tengo que añadir que durante toda la estancia también pudimos comprobar como todo el personal del hotel esta a tu entera disposición para facilitarte la estancia, y además de Sergi quiero destacar a una compañera suya de recepción que no recuerdo su nombre, pero que era Italiana, de Roma… muchas gracias desde aquí por todo.

Llegamos a nuestra habitación en la primera planta, y con vistas a Barcelona… con una pequeña terraza para poder disfrutar de la misma, pero por culpa del mal tiempo no lo pudimos hacer, la habitación es amplia con una cama de 180 muy cómoda, televisión de 37 pulgadas, armario amplio para poder ubicar todo, y sobre todo un baño enorme, muy bonito y con un plato de ducha que ya lo quisiera yo para mi casa, todo perfecto con amenidades de L¨occitane, además del periódico matinal y apertura de la habitación por la noche.

Disfrutamos del hotel y sus servicios, tales como el jacuzzi interior, la piscina, Sauna, Masajes, y mi mujer de un pilling a cargo de unos peces (garra rufa) quiero recordar, durante el día y sobre las 11 de la mañana marchábamos a recorrer la ciudad, pero al llegar por la noche, nada mejor que un baño, Sauna y a relajar para cargar las pilas.

Además el “problema” que se puede suscitar con la ubicación del hotel, el propio hotel te lo soluciona, ya que tienen un transporte diario y gratuito que te deja y recoge en el centro de Barcelona, en el Paseo de Gracia, esquina Diagonal… cada hora suben y bajan y te despreocupas de transporte, nosotros hicimos uso de el todos los días excepto el primero que decidimos bajar en coche, y viendo el  trafico en Barcelona comprobamos que era una opción muy mala, lo mejor el coche en el parking y a disfrutar de la ciudad.

El desayuno del hotel se sirve en un salón con una terraza con vistas a la ciudad, el problema era el fresco que hacia por las mañanas y las pocas ganas que teníamos de pasar frío, pero bueno la opción existe y seguro que en verano se disfrutara y mucho.
El desayuno es muy correcto, sin grandes alardes pero no se echa de menos nada en mayor o menor medida, como pero… la tostadora, en cuatro días no conseguimos tostar ni una rebanada de pan, al final cansábamos y la tomábamos de cualquier manera, bien es verdad que en ningún momento comentamos nada al personal de desayuno, que viendo su efectividad, seguro que habrían tomado alguna medida, pero bueno por lo demás todo perfecto.

Como anécdota final, el ultimo día y a ultima hora de la noche nos quedamos sin televisión, se apago… llamamos a recepción pero ya no había nadie de mantenimiento, aun así subió una persona para intentar solucionarlo, pero no fue posible… no obstante ya era hora de ir a dormir jejeje.

Sin mas recomendar encarecidamente estas instalaciones, destacando sin lugar a dudas el personal del hotel,  y en especial a Sergi y su compañera Romana (lamento no acordarme del nombre insisto), Gracias por todo y sin lugar a dudas cuando volvamos a la ciudad repetiremos hotel

Un saludo.

28,Hotel muy tranquilo y bonito,"Soy de la ciudad, no estaba haciendo el turista. Sólo quería pasar una noche tranquila y romántica.
El restaurante Orangerie es buenísimo y muy tranquilo, como todo el hotel.
El hotel es romántico, silencioso , tranquilo y con unas vistas espectaculares,. Por la noche no se oye un alma.
Estaba en una habitación deluxe y la verdad es que era normalita aunque cómoda. No era una habitación de lujo, la verdad. eso sí, super limpio.

El personal del hotel nos trató estupendamente. Fueron super amables pero hay que ir sin prisas pues son lentos sirviendo. Además cuando dejamos el hotel venía una boda y dio la sensación de desorganizacion...

En general, excelente",4,2011,05,30
28,"Di "" gran lusso"" c'e solo la vista.","Hotel situato in cima al monte Tibidabo, alle spalle di Barcellona, con vista veramente mozzafiato. Per tutto il resto e' un  albergo di buona categoria; le stanze necessitano qua e la' di interventi di manutenzione ed anche alcune parti comuni come i consunti tappeti dell'ingresso. Molto distante (20/30 min. di taxi o shuttle bus) dal centro di Barcellona.",4,2011,05,27
28,"Precioso Hotel pero con importantes carencias, servicio desayuno de **","Acabamos de volver de pasar un maravilloso fin de semana en Barcelona. Estaba muy ilusionada en esta escapadita que ha sido casi perfecta. Hemos estado un fin de semana en este Hotel que es precioso.
La verdad es que iba con cierto temor por algunas de las críticas aquí leidas, algunas creo que sin fundamento, otras con toda la razón. 
Al llegar recibimos una acogida con todas las atenciones y cordial, al tener cierta prisa nos acompañaron rápidamente a la habitación. Puede ser por este motivo que no nos mencionaran (y a nosotros tambien se nos pasó) la copa de bienvenida.
La habitación preciosa, aunque me hubiera gustado más una con vistas a Barcelona, por la que pregunté pero me dijeron que no había disponibilidad. La verdad creo que ni lo miraron, pero bueno, ya digo que la habitación era muy bonita.
Al abrir la neverita ¡ohh sorpresa!, había una  madalena a medio comer. No nos dió muy buena impresión la verdad...avisamos a una persona del servicio que en ese momento (las 18,40) estaba supervisando los mueblebares.
La bajada a barcelona muy bien con el servicio del Hotel, puntual y comodo. Ésta es una de las críticas que he leido y que creo que no tiene fundamento. Hay una buena comunicación a Barcelona, ya sea con el del Hotel o con autobús que sale justo delante del hotel cada vente minutos. La vuelta si uno quiere cenar en Barcelona, es necesario hacerla en taxi. Las dos noches que estuvimos utilizamos este transporte y puedo decir que, en contra de algun comentario que he leido,  el precio fue muy razonable, 15 Euros la primera noche y 16 la segunda.
La sorpresa vino con los desayunos; despues de la primera noche en la que llegamos muy tarde al hotel nos levantamos tarde y llegamos justo al desayuno, cierran a las 11. A esa hora ya no quedaba casi nada y lo poco que quedaba estaba siendo retirado. Pedimos nada mas llegar unos huevos y nos dijeron que de acuerdo, despues de 10 minutos sin noticias volvimos a preguntar por ellos a otro camarero y éste sí que cursó el pedido. No había nada de fruta, el zumo de naranja no era 100% natural, la bolleria consistía simplemente en croissanes...etc. No se que cobran por los desayunos (hice la reserva con una oferta que me incluía el desayuno) pero supongo que no debe ser nada barato, me hubiera subido por las paredes si hubiera tenida que pagar este desayuno aparte. 
Nos fuimos a dar una vuelta y a comer y a la vuelta para una pequeña siesta la habitación no estaba hecha. No son cosas importantes pero un Hotel de 5***** no debería permitirse estos fallos. 
Al día siguiente día de nuestra partida, bajamos a desayunar esperando tener mas suerte y la cosa fue peor! el peor desayuno de hotel en mucho tiempo. No había nada, y aun no eran las once! Lo estaban retirando todo! Nadie vino a preguntarnos que deseabamos, tuvimos que ir detras de los camareros (por cierto el mismo que el dia anterior no nos habia hecho caso, repitió la jugada, igual no nos entendió...). Horroroso desayuno, incomprensible para un Hotel de esta categoría! Deberían tomar ejemplo de los Paradores, del Eurostars Gran Marina en el mismo Barcelona, del Palacio del Bailio en Cordoba, del Hotel Xerry Park en Jerez (de supuestamente menos categoría y que les da 20.000 vueltas en el desayuno!).
En resumen, bonito hotel, preciosas habitaciones, pero el servicio no es el esperado en un hotel de 5*****, la dirección debería preocuparse de este punto si quiere ser un Hotel de lujo. He estado bien pero no repetiría, ya que hay mejores en Barcelona, el trato en el Eurostars Gran Marina fue exquisito!
Así que SI RECOMIENDO el Hotel por lo bonito y porque yo consegui una buena tarifa (no pagaria 200 Euros por noche en este Hotel) pero no lo recomiendo por el desastroso desayuno.",3,2011,05,16
28,Preis/Leistung stimmt nicht,"Das Hotel hat definitiv eine tolle Lage hoch über der Stadt mit einem genialen Ausblick - aber den lässt sich das Hotel auch teuer bezahlen. Wir hätten uns jedenfalls in der Preisklasse einen wesentlich höherwertigen Standard vorgestellt. Unser Zimmer war dringend renovierungsbedürftig. Und gegen das Gegröle einer französichen Reisegruppe hat das Hotelpersonal rein gar nichts unternommen. Für den Parkplatz verlangt das Hotel übrigens €21 pro Tag extra, darauf wird man nicht hingewiesen.",3,2011,05,08
28,Sehr gut geführtes Hotel mit atemberaubendem Blick über Barcelona,"Das Gran Hotel La Florida ist für mich der ideale Ausgangspunkt für einen Aufenthalt in Barcelona. Ob privat oder geschäftlich, nach einem Tag (oder einer Nacht) in der aufregenden Metropole ist die Rückkehr auf den Tibidabo ins La Florida nach ca. 25 Minuten Fahrt eine Wohltat für Körper und Seele: ansprechend eingerichtete Zimmer und Suiten, geschmackvoll gestaltete Empfangsräume, ein wundervoller Wellnessbereich mit In- & Outdoor-Pool sorgen in Kombination mit dem sehr aufmerksamen und sympathischen Personal für eine private, fast familiäre Atmosphäre.

Absolutes Highlight ist der wunderschöne Blick über das einem zu Füßen liegende Barcelona. Tagsüber vom Pool, am Abend von der Restaurant-Terrasse oder nachts von der Außenbar: atemberaubend. Der Aufpreis für Zimmer mit Meerblick ist eine lohnende Investition. Für den hoteleigenen und kostenfreien Shuttle in die Stadt empfiehlt sich eine Reservierung, ansonsten ist die Fahrt auch mit dem Taxi kein Problem.",5,2011,05,04
28,El lugar perfecto...,"todo un sueño...

28,Un hotel magnífico,"Este hotel tiene una ubicación  maravillosa, el pasajero tiene a Barcelona a sus pies. El hotel posee un bar al aire libre, dispuesto en forma escalonada, con pérgolas llenas de flores, donde se puede comer y tomar algo gozando de unas vistas espectaculares.
Las habitaciones son muy amplias, limpias, cómodas hasta lujosas.
El desayuno buffet es muy bueno.
El personal dispensa un trato acogedor y muy eficiente.",5,2011,02,14
28,Der Geheimtipp für Barcelona,"Das Gran Hotel La Florida ist aus meiner Sicht das interessanteste Hotel in Barcelona. Es ist ganz oben auf dem Tibidabo gelegen mit der wohl besten Aussicht über Barcelona. Das Hotel selbst ist ebenfall sensationell und 5 Sterne ganz sicher wert. Von dem ausgezeichneten Service über das tolle Restaurant, bis hin zum Wellnessbereich, einfach super. Wer einen Geheimtipp für Barcelona sucht ... hier ist er!",5,2011,02,13
28,What a feeling,"Hoch über Barcelona, am Montjuic, liegt das Florida, eines der wohl besten Häuser in der katalinischen Hauptstadt. Leider istr es preislich ziemlich abgehoben, man bezahlt viel allein für die tolle Aussicht. Aber ein Abendessen auf der Terrasse mit Blick über die Millionenstadt entschädigt für vieles, vor allem, weil das Restaurant Speisen auf sehr hohem Niveau anbietet. Auch das FRühstück ist aller Ehren wert. Hierhin kommt man, das entsprechende Budget vorausgesetzt, gerne wieder.",5,2011,01,29
28,Bestes Hotel in Barcelona,"Wir sind zumindest 2mal im Jahr in Barcelona und versuchen immer neue Hotels auszuprobieren. Bei unserem Urlaub diesen Jänner waren wir EXTREM zufrieden mit dem Gran Hotel La Florida.

Das faszinierende an dem Hotel ist die Lage. Am Tibitabo, dem Hausberg der Stadt, ragt das Hotel herab auf Barcelona. Eine bessere Sicht auf die Stadt kann man kaum haben.

Wir haben ein Zimmer mit Blick zur Stadt gebucht und hatten das Glück ein Zimmer mit kleinem Balkon zu bekommen. Sogar von der Badewanne aus hatte man in diesem Zimmer einen wunderbaren Blick auf die Stadt.

Das Zimmer war ungewöhnlich groß und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels der Stadt ist es zwar nicht hypermodern, dafür hat der historische Bau einen ganz eigenen Flair.

Sehr zu empfehlen, vorallem in der kalten Jahreszeit, ist auch das Spa mit großem Pool, Whirlpool, Sauna und Dampfbad.

Das Personal, das aus allen Teilen Europas zusammengestückelt scheint (aber wohl gemerkt von überall nur die Besten!) war stets hilfreich und zuvorkommend!

Der einzige Nachteil an dem Hotel - der aber wie oben erwähnt auch der größte Vorteil ist - ist die Lage. Ideal ist es ein Mietauto zu nehmen und selbst die Gegend zu erkunden. Man braucht so 20 Minuten bis in die Innenstadt. Negativ erwähnt sei, dass für den Parkplatz € 21 am Tag fällig sind. Unverständlich bei einem Hotel das ohen Auto kaum zu erreichen ist. Ein Taxi in die Stadt ist aber erschwinglich - rund €  20!

Insgesamt: ein Traumhotel! Jederzeit wieder!",5,2011,01,27
28,"La Florida, Gran Hotel","Alles im allen ein kleines aber feines Hotel am Rande Barcelonas. Es gab kleinere technische Maengel, die den Aufenthalt etwas beeintraechtigt haben. Ist aber auf jeden Fall ein sehr romantisches Hotel. Fruehstueck war nicht ganz so beeindruckend, aber qualitativ gut.",4,2011,01,14
28,Ruhig gelegenes Hotel mit fantastischem Blick,"Das Hotel liegt in ruhiger Lage oberhalb von Barcelona und ein gutes Stück außerhalb des Stadtzentrums. Die Anbindung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln an die Stadt ist gegeben, allerdings dauert die Fahrt 30-45min. Dafür besticht das Hotel mit einem wunderschönen Blick über die Stadt und auf das Meer. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sauber mit Terrasse. Das Hotel bietet einen Indoor und Outdoor Pool und einen schönen Spa-Bereich.",5,2011,01,01
28,estupendo pero indiscreto,"Es normal que aún teniendo el letrerito de no molestar, una ""señora"", con uniforme cargada de llaves, entre en la habitación y diga que viene a reponer el minibar, vaya verguenza..............., la encontramos dentro de la habitación., y nosotros saliendo de la ducha. poca ética",3,2010,12,27

Die Aussicht auf Barcelona ist phänomenal, In- und Outdoor Pool-Anlage sind gut. Die terrassierte Bar lädt zum verweilen ein, Zimmer und Bad sind grosszügig. Hier gilt es grösser Distanz zum Zentrum mit mehr Nachtruhe und feinster Aussicht auf Barcelona und das Meer abzuwägen. Für mich stimmts, ich bezahle lieber eine etwas längere Taxi Fahrt ins Zentrum und kann dafür in Ruhe schlafen.Das Essen ist sehr gut, das Personal freundlich und hilfsbereit.",4,2010,12,05
28,Tolles Hotel,sehr schönes hotel mit beindruckendem blick über ganz barcelona. alleine aufgrund des ausblicks zahlt es sich aus hier einige stunden oder tage zu verbringen. toller service und gutes essen im restaurant. das personal war sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. nachtleben und sehenswürdigkeiten - ausser dem hotel selbst und der Sagrada Corazón - darf man sich hier natürlich nicht erwarten.,5,2010,10,29
28,Barcelona zu Füßen,"Das Gran Hotel La Florida thront auf einem Hügel hoch über Barcelona und eröffnet einen grandiosen Blick auf die katalanische Metropole. Das Hotel befindet sich in einem historischen Gebäude. Je nach Lage, bietet sich von den Zimmern der Blick auf die Stadt und ihre Vororte, aufs Hinterland oder auf den Vergnügungspark Tibidabo in unmittelbarer Nähe. Hallenbad, Bar und Restaurant haben eine traumhafte Lage: Morgens die erwachende Stadt vor Augen, abends ein schier unübersehbares Lichtermeer, im Hintergrund den Kreuzfahrthafen. Wer im La Florida logiert, sollte allerdings unbedingt über einen Wagen verfügen; denn bis in die Stadt sind es mindestens 10 Kilometer über eine kurvenreiche Bergstraße.",4,2010,09,26
28,super Blick und einfach schön,"das Hotel ist auf einem Hügel in Barcelona, man hat einen super Blcik über Barcelona, tagsüber und noch besser am Abend, man wird sehr nett empfangen, ich bin kurz vor Mitternacht erst angekommen und mit einem Glas Champus empfangen worden, die Zimmer sind sehr schön, das Badezimmer ist der Hammer, Service sehr gut, Essen einfach super, das Hotel hat eine sehr schöne Spa-Anlage, ich kann das Hotel nur empfehlen",5,2010,09,16
28,Que vergüenza,"Mirando las críticas al hotel La Florida veo que no he sido la única que ha sufrido un hurto en el mismo.
El sábado pasado fuimos a la boda de unos amigos, con 50 invitados, la gran mayoría família y a última hora, justo cuando nos íbamos a seguir la fiesta a la discoteca, me cercioré de que no tenía mi cámara de fotos. 
Durante toda la noche estube entre el salón y la terraza. Por lo que la cámara se quedó por allí. Al ir a reclamarla, aún estaba el servicio recogiendo las mesas etc.. nadie la había visto. 

He hablado varias veces con el hotel para que por favor intenten averiguar algo pero su actitud ha sido bastante pasota, dando a entender que estamos acusando al personal injustamente.. Casualmente no es la primera vez que sucede puesto que he visto otra crítica con robo de cámara incluido...",1,2010,09,13
28,Lujo en lo más alto de Barcelona,"Nuestra visita al Gran Hotel La Florida ha sido maravillosa, buscábamos una escapada romántica y aunque estuvimos tentados por el paquete romántico (395 eur hab doble + desayuno buffet + champan y fresas bienvenida + baño romántico + cena restaurante + 8% iva) al final nos decidimos por la oferta de verano (225 eur hab doble + desayuno buffet con iva inc), comimos y cenamos en la terraza exterior, todo muy correcto, lo mejor la piscina a ras de suelo con fondo metálico y agua cristalina, parcialmente cubierta y parcialmente descubierta, lo peor fue que sólo estuvimos una noche y que nos tocó el segundo piso, cuando el hotel tiene 6 plantas.",5,2010,08,26
28,espectacular,"las mejores vistas de barcelona, el servicio muy bueno, las instalaciones muy bien, estilo deco, y el restaurant ademas del lujo la buena comida, y la atencion es fantastica",5,2010,08,12
28,tolles Hotel,Das La Florida ist unser absolutes Lieblingshotel in Barcelona. Das Hotel liegt weit ausserhalb der Stradt auf einem Berg. Was einige als Nachteil sehen ist für uns Vorteil. Man hat einen traumhaften Blick über die Stadt. Es gibtz einen kostenlosen Bus-service der einen in die Stadt bringt. Das Essen (Frühstück und Roomservice) ist wunderbar. Das Personal überaus nett und die Einrichtung der Zimmer trift genau unser Geschmack.,5,2010,07,26
28,Immer wieder gerne,"Wir waren zum wiederholten mal in diesem Hotel und sind immer wieder begeistert.
Die Lage weit oberhalb der Stadt ist atemberaubend. 
Das Mittelmeer & die Stadt zu deinen Füßen, die Terasse von welcher man das genießen kann, ein unglaublicher Blick mit einem hohem Romantikfaktor am Abend.
Selbst wenn es in der Stadt heiß und stickig ist, oberhalb der Stadt auf den Bergen ist es immer sehr angenehm. 
Es fährt regelmäßig ein Shuttleservice des Hotel runter in die Stadt bzw auch wieder zurück zum Hotel. Hierfür sollte man sich jedoch rechtzeitig anmelden. Sollten alle Plätze belegt sein ist die schnellste Alternative das Taxi.
Dieses kostet, je nach Destination 15 - 20 € / Strecke - bis zum Flughafen sind es rund 50 €
Alternative zum Taxi in die Stadt gibt es  einen Bus bzw die Seilbahn ,was aber deutlich länger dauert.
Wellness bzw Schwimmbad sind hervorragend wenn auch nicht ganz günstig was die Wellnes angeht. 
Das Personal ist immer sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich und versucht dem Gast alle Annehmlichkeiten zu ermöglichen.
Einziger Wehmutstropfen ist, je nach Jahreszeit, daß der Vergnügungspark Tibidabo welcher direkt nebenan ist. 
Da kann es im Sommer schon einmal etwas lauter werden wenn man tagsüber am Außenpool liegt.",5,2010,07,26
28,Ein Traum von Hotel,"Dieses Hotel ist traumhaft. Ok, ich sag' gleich am Anfang, was schlecht ist: es liegt auf dem Tibidabo, dem Hausberg von Barcelona gleich neben der Kirche Sagrat Cor. Man muß also mit dem Bus, Taxi oder der legendären Straßenbahn in die Stadt fahren.
Das waren auch schon die negativen Punkte. Das Gebäude ist sehr schön ausgestattet, einzelne Bereiche des Hauses haben ein Motiv, überall gibt es sehenswerte Dekorationen oder Springbrunnenanlagen. Das Personal ist perfekt und sehr hilfsbereit. Freies WLAN. In den Zimmern kann man teilweise auf dem Bett liegen und die fantastische Aussicht auf die Stadt geniesen. Die Zimmer sind riesig, die Dusche berieselt von der Decke und ist so groß wie in vielen anderen Hotels die Bäder. Wem die Aussicht zu langweilig wird, kann auch zum großen LCD-TV greifen. Das Frühstück ist zwar bißchen spanisch-spartanisch, dafür sind die gebotenen Speisen hervorragend, es gibt spanischen Schinken, Käse, usw. Man kann übrigens im Pool am Beckenrand stehen, und den Ausblick auf die Stadt auf sich wirken lassen. Dazu ein Cocktail... der leider *hüstel* ein wenig teuer ist. Aber wer würde es dem Hotel übelnehmen?",5,2010,07,04
28,Tolle Aussicht,"Das La Florida ist ziemlich ab vom Schuss, liegt aber wunderbar auf der Rückseite des Hausberges von Barcelona. Belohnt wird man von einer wunderbaren Aussicht auf die Berge und die Stadt. Die Zimmer sind toll und die Preise in der Vor- und Nachsaison absolut fair. Die Anreise braucht ein gewisses ""gewusst wie"". Es geht aber nicht nur über die Standseilbahn, sondern auch mit dem öffentlichen Bus. Für die Shoppingtour in die City bietet das Hotel einen kostenlosen Shuttleservice an.",5,2010,06,30
28,Hotel mit Tradition,"Hier hat Hemingway schon übernachtet. Hoch über Barcelona am Tibidabo mit Blick auf die Stadt und das Meer.
Der Nachteil: Das Hotel ist abgelegen und man braucht gute 20 Minuten mit dem Taxi hinauf auf den Berg.
Der Vorteil. Es ist ruhig und der Blick ist atemberaubend. 
Das Hotel ist erstklassig. Die Gastronomie, das SPA , die Zimmer und die Ausstatuung. Alles vom Feinsten. Der Service ist bei einigen Mitarbeitern leider etwas schnöselig.",4,2010,06,09
28,La gran decepcion,"La gran decepcion, el personal del hotel es pesimo, no tienen ni idea de tratar a sus clientes, parece que sobremos.

Me parece que falta una buena direccion, para que puedan saber que es un hotel de lujo.",1,2010,05,17
28,un gran lugar,"estuve con mi familis hace ya un tiempopero siempre he tenido ganas de dejar mi gran impresion por este gran hotel.el sitio es imponente con toda vista de barcelona,majestuosa a tus pies.unas piscinas exteriores en escalera de impresion asi como la piscina interior de acero,preciosa.un jacuzzy,baño turco,saunas y demas completaban el spa.el deauyo servido en el comedor con unas magnificas vistas era muy agradable.mencion aparte es el tema del alojamiento.yo tenia una habitacion normal,pues como seran las suites.unas sabanas de algodon egipcio que eran de ensueño.una gran cama.buena decoracion,sobre todo muy relajante.los baños magnificos.mi hermana viajaba con bebe y le prepararon una cuna de postal,pudiendo escoger hasta el color de las sabanas,y para mi sobrina mayor,albornoz y pantuflas infantiles una monada.una noche cene en el restaurante la orangerie,bueno aunque un poco carito.en fin,luego un monton de detalles que hacen de la estancia algo muy gratificante.",4,2010,04,27
28,que decepcion,"Este pasado fin de semana nos fuimos mi marido y yo a celebrar nuestro 18 aniversario de bodas, pensando en algo especial contratamos un pack romantico en el Hotel La Florida, con baño romantico, cena romantica, etc... fue de todo menos romantico, al menos lo que nos ofrecieron, menos mal que el romanticismo lo pusimos nosotros. Para empezar cuando llegamos nos fuimos directamente a la zona spa de piscina, pasamos mucho frio en esa zona, en teoria en pleno invierno, es para estar a una temperatura superior a la exterior, pues creo que hacia mas frio que fuera, el agua de la piscina "" climatizada"" por decir algo, estaba helada ¡¡¡¡ la zona de vestuarios y saunas, estaba totalmente desantedida y sucia, la sauna no funcionaba, no habia personal, tuvimos que buscar en unos armarios para encontrar unas toallas por nuestra cuenta, la cafeteria o bar de la piscina cerrado, no podiamos tomar nada mientras estabas en las hamacas descansando, total nadie que pudiera atenderte en cualquier momento. Bueno aun asi, teniamos la ilusion del baño romantico, ufffffff  "" que romantico "" tuvimos que hacer contorsionismo para meternos los dos en la mini bañera que nos habian preparado, si,.si mucho petalo de rosa, pero no cabiamos, una bañera individual para dos ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ como va a ser romentico eso ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ en el pack contratado entraba una botella de cava mientras estabas en la bañera, pues si no la reclamamos nada de nada, en el cuarto de baño ni papelera habia ¡¡¡ y ademas el suelo de la habitacion de parcket todo completamente rallado. La cena no estuvo mal, pero la atencion del personal PESIMA ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Ya habiamos estado anteriormente en este hotel alguna vez, y desde luego a cambiado mucho, la atencion del personal no es lo que era. Para poder pagar la cuenta cuando nos fuimos tuvimos que pedirlo casi por favor, te veian esperando en la recepcion y nadie te prestaba atencion. En definitiva, el hotel muy bonito, pero desantendido, y el personal mediocre, no para un 5 estrellas. Desde luego yo no volvere a este hotel ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡",3,2010,03,08
28,Impresionante,Lo mejor del hotel son las vistas de toda la ciudad de Barcelona desde la terraza de la habitación y desde la terraza del bar del hotel.,5,2010,01,30
28,Schönes Hotel im Himmel Barcelonas,Das Hotel ist sehr schön! Ruhige Lage. Zimmer sehr großzügig.,4,2009,12,07
28,Toller Blick ueber Barcelona,"Wir bekamen ein Eckzimmer im 3. Stock mit einer grossen Terrasse und fantastischem Blick ueber Barcelona. Vor allem das Badezimmer war sehr gerauemig. Wenn man im La Florida bucht, sollte man unbedingt ein Zimmer mit Aussicht bestellen, denn die Zimmer mit Blick zum Parkplatz sind nicht unbedingt attraktiv.
Das Personal wirkt etwas unprofessionell, aber bemueht. Wir hatten schon am Nachmittag Bescheid gegeben, dass man uns fuer abends ein Taxi bestellen soll. Es war natuerlich nicht da und wir warteten 40 Minuten (!), bis endlich ein Taxi kam. Niemand vom Personal fuehlte sich dafuer verantwortlich, man entschuldigte sich zwar, gab aber als Grund das Taxiunternehmen an. Es ging uns nicht alleine so, auch andere Paare warteten auf ihr Taxi, das sie vorbestellt hatten. 
Der Pool Bereich mit Bar ist sehr schoen gestaltet, vor allem, wenn man abends einen Aperitif trinkt, hat man ebenfalls einen tollen Blick auf Barcelona.",4,2009,10,23
28,Ni por asomo corresponde a un 5 estrellas,"Vamos a dejarlo en un 4 estrellas tirando a mucho.  Las vistas son espectaculares, pues está situado a 500 metros de altura sobre el mar.  Pero el servicio de transporte público hasta el Tibidabo es incomodísimo y de regularidad pésima.  El interior del hotel está bien, para un 4 estrellas. Los exteriores y alrededores, en cambio, son horribles.  Parece ser que cuando lo reformaron, (pues el edificio según nos contó un amigo que vive por la zona estuvo muchísimos años en ruinas y a punto de caerse), se cargaron media cima de la montaña en la dichosa reforma.  Y según nos cuentan, el ayuntamiento continua por su parte con la destrucción de la cima de la montaña construyendo montañas rusas cerca del hotel, parkings para automóviles, etc, etc....
Total, que una desilusión.  Lo mejor que puede hacer el público visitante de Barcelona es olvidarse de este hotel y alojarse en otros más recomendables del propio centro urbano. Que los hay, y de mucha mejor calidad.",2,2009,08,09
28,Pésimo recuerdo del personal del hotel,"El día 25 de Agosto del pasado año,hicimos con mucha ilusión,reserva en este hotel.El motivo,celebrabamos nuestro veinticinco aniversario de boda,la reserva consistió en tres habitaciones,para nosotros y nuestros hijos y también una cena para todos en el restaurante del hotel,el gasto que hicimos fué considerable,pero si te queda un buen recuerdo,eso es lo de menos,el caso es que esa noche después de cenar,salimos a pasear por los jardines del hotel,ahí es donde empezó todo,nos desapareció como por arte de mágia nuestra camara de fotos,por supuesto no era cualquier porqueria sino la cosa hubiera cambiado,era una canon g9 que acababamos de comprar,dentro todas las fotos de esa noche y algunas más,bueno ningún empleado sabía nada,desapareció como por arte de mágia,que pena en esa zona habian camaras de seguridad nadie se tomo el más minimo interés,al poco tiempo recibí una llamada de un empleado pero yo estaba fuera,por lo tanto no atendí sus explicaciones que eran estas,según el habían removido todo el hotel y ni rastro de mi camara.Mi teoría es otra desde luego alguien del hotel la encontró y adios muy buenas,teniendo en cuenta que esa noche dejé una buena suma de dinero,no les hubiese costado nada tener el detalle de comprarme una camara,pero bueno,yo no soy una persona famosa,entonces que más da,de todas formas,nunca recomendare este hotel a nadie y por supuesto no volvere nunca más,pues guardo un muy mal recuerdo de el.",1,2009,07,29
28,Qué desilusión,"Esta noche hemos estado mi marido y yo en el Hotel La Florida, ayer celebrábamos nuestro 4 aniversario de boda y como acabamos de tener un bebe, nos apetecía una noche de tranquilidad. Pensamos en este hotel , por ser un lugar especial, un poco apartado de la ciudad etc. La noche era estupenda, fresquita pero agradable y decicimos cenar en la terraza de la psicina: QUE DESASTRE!!!!  A parte de que 1 ensalada, 2 coca-colas y 2 hamburgesas nos costaron nada más y nada menos que 75€!!!! Tardamos 1.30 en servirnos la comida. La chica que nos tomó nota nos pareció que no se enteraba de nada, yo después de pendir una ensalada y una hamburgesa le pedí si era mucho y me dijo que las raciones eran grandes, así que anulé la ensalada, mi marido que había pedido lo mismo (pero con otro ensalada) mantuvo los 2 platos. Cuando llegó la comida se habían equivocado de ensalada!!!! Hasta aquí ningú problema, el tema vino después dejaron a mi marido sin comida 1 hora y media y eran ya las 11 de la noche!!!! Pero lo peor no fue esto sino el hecho que cuando fuimos 3 veces a reclamar nos trataron fatal y nos dijeron que era culpa nuestra por haber cambiado de platos!!!

En fin.. me sabe mal xq nos puismo de mal humor y era un día especial para nosotros y más ahora que con la llegada del peque no solemos tenerlos...

Cuando uno acude a uno de estos lugares acude para vivir una experiencia especial y todo el personal tiene que entenderlo y ayudarte a que disfrutes al máximo!!! Si el personal del hotel no entiende este concepto básico, los auguro un negro futuro ... de hecho no parece que les vaya muy bien xq le falta una buena dosi de mantenimiento...

QUE DESILUSION!!!",2,2009,07,09
28,una manera de sentirte mimado,"hicimos nuestro banquete de boda hace 37 años y nos hacia mucha ilusion ver como habia quedado despues de la reforma y realmente no nos defraudó en absoluto,el dia de mi boda no pude apreciar la magnifica ubicacion de este hotel, que maravilla!!!",5,2009,04,14
28,Escapada muy relajante.,"He pasado dos dias maravillosos en este hotel, y es justo lo que esperaba.
Hay gente que critica este hotel por su situación y por estar alejado del centro, pero quizá no han estado bien informados. Es un hotel para ir a relajarse, lejos de la ciudad, donde puedes pasear, tomar el sol, bañarte, y no oir constantemente el tráfico del centro de Barcelona.
El Spa es una maravilla, limpio y tranquilo. La piscina merece un 10, y el hotel disfruta de ella desde los bares, y aún te relajas más. Las habitaciones con unas vistas espectaculares, y en el restaurante l'Orangerie cenamos de maravilla.
Gràcias a todos por el servicio tan agradable, y una mención especial para la florista. La decoración floral es preciosa, sencilla y elegante. Y un consejo si os gusta el Caipiriña pedid el Caipiriña salvaje!!!
Espero volver otra vez!!!!!!!!!",5,2009,03,25
28,Durchgestylts Hotel mit affektierem Peronal,"Alles mit einer Wahnsinns-Aussicht rundherum - je nachdem, wo man sich befindet - über Barcelona, das Meer und das hügelige Hinterland. Wirklich toll. Das Personal ist allerdings weit nicht so geschult, wie es in einem Haus dieser Klasse zu erwarten wäre. 
Der Service hat für ein Hotel dieser Klasse doch sehr viel Verbesserungspotential. 
Hallenbad, Außenpool, Whirlpool, Fitnessraum, Sauna waren sehr schlecht gewartet eben ein bisschen schmudelig.
Zimmer waren super sauber und durchgestylt , aber es ist zu erwarten bei den Preisen .",3,2008,12,11
28,No pienso volver.,"En general la estancia fue correcta, pero sufrimos un serio incidente. Al dejar la habitacion (check out) nos olvidamos un anillo en el baño, al cabo de 3 horas, cuando nos dimos cuenta, ya habia desparecido.  De momento no ha aparecido... Me sorprende que ocurran cosas como estas en hoteles esta categoria. Un saludo",1,2008,10,16
28,Maravilloso hotel,"Es un hotel maravilloso, teniamos una suite con unas vistas espectaculares se veia toda la ciudad, el tibidabo...
El spa está muy bien, la picina y el jacuzzi tb aunque lo mejor es el desayuno, de unacalidad insuperable.
El servicio tb es excelente, todos muyatentos vale la pena alojarse en este hotel sin duda!",5,2008,08,24
28,maravilloso,"Maravilloso hotel en el que hemos sido turistas en nuestra propia ciudad. la Habitación perfecta, con un baño increible. El desayuno es buenisimo y la des de la terraza la vista es increible. Ideal para un fin de semnana romantico y de relax.
