21,Howard’s Visit to the Grand Hyatt,"The executive room was dark and we were greeted by a bowl of mouldy fruit. Went to the executive lounge and that was just as bad, no staff, no food, small selection of colas and water but no wine.
Between 5 & 7 there was a buffet and drinks available in the main restaurant for executive members which was a big improvement on the lack off anything lunch time.",3,2024,10,14
21,Fabulous hotel with superb staff,"This was my first time staying at the Grand Hyatt and I cannot say enough wonderful things about the hotel.  From the friendly chap who opened my taxi door and took my bags, to the seamless check-in, beautifully comfortable beds, excellent rooftop bar/restaurant and helpful staff (calling taxis, finding out where I can buy the pillows that they use, and what size, providing sun screen because I forgot to bring any) I really enjoyed my time here and was very sad to leave!",5,2024,09,17

21,"Most not ""Grand Hyatt""-like Grand Hyatt","No tissue box. The shower floor is slippery, no anti-slippery mat, no place to hang towels but only in the shower, causing the towels to be drenched. No face towel. Dirty stained marks on window. Insufficient lighting in the room. There is no dim light. It's so dark at night when going to the toilet. But had to turn on the brights, waking up the other person in the room. ",3,2024,10,11
21,A hotel worth the visit,A fantastic hotel that’s stylish and elegant with staff to match. The staff in every team were attentive and very helpful and the location was fantastic. We were visiting prior to boarding a cruise and this was the perfect launch point. Easy from the airport and to the cruise terminal.,5,2024,10,07
21,Quick but memorable stay,"Hotel was at capacity for our two day stay, however, the team at GH Barcelona made it a very memorable one! Every member of the team we meet was beyond courteous, eager to help, and always had a smile. We even got an upgrade(honeymoon stay before our cruise) for the second night and they moved all our luggage(with permission) while we were gone for the day. The entire hotel is immaculate and has great design. Great variety of food options at multiple price points. Grand Club has limited hours but a wonderful grad and go spread throughout the early afternoon. Definitely checkout the “Tapas Hour” if you have Grand Club access located on the lobby level from 5 - 7 pm. Not the most convenient spot to downtown Barcelona, but an easy cab ride to all spots and an oasis from the craziness that can be Barcelona. Will definitely return soon!",5,2024,09,30
21,Perfect stay at the Grand Hyatt in Barcelona,"Great modern hotel, amazing relaxed and friendly staff, always helpful and deliver what is needed. Great Concierge, fountain of knowledge",5,2024,09,27
21,Loved it here. Hotel very spacious,The hotel is so big and I loved my time here. The spa is probably the best spa I have ever been too. So much space and sauna room. I enjoyed the spa the most. The views of the city from the room are amazing too. Staff are very friendly. I would definitely come back. I wasn’t keen on breakfast and that is the only constructive feedback. Pancakes and waffles are only nice if made fresh. I appreciate it is a big hotel therefore for efficiency could maybe get a pancake machine which makes these fresh and would still save time. ,5,2024,09,25
21,Don’t be fooled by the photos,"My room’s TV and phone were broken, and when I returned one day my phone charger USB phone charger was bent and broken. I went downstairs to tell the front desk, these two ladies said they would send someone from IT. One of the ladies said she would come up herself as well. I never saw her again. She was probably training the other person next to her - that not setting a good example. About 45 min later no one came to my room. I had to go downstairs again to ask what’s happening - I wanted to relax after a long day and I didn’t have much time before I had to go out again. The front desk staff member said he didn’t know when IT would be able to come fix my TV and phone, and he asked me to call the front desk to check in if they didn’t arrive soon. But my phone is broken so how am I going to call the front desk? That’s some brilliant problem solving right there. They later “replaced” my broken USB charger with another one, but it was probably a cord another guest left behind, it looked old and it was sticky. 

Later I went to the spa where the jacuzzi/pool looked like the aftermath of a Las Vegas pool party with towels everywhere to the point where you don’t even know which lounge chair was occupied. Also the ladies locker room had about 5 pairs of used flip flops strewn around. The pool floors and stairs are made with metal and are very slippery - I saw two people slip on the stairs as they entered the pool. 

Also in the end, I had late check out at 1pm but my key card stops working at 11am. So I make that extra trip down to the front desk to get a new key. We all love doing that right? 

I wouldn’t be fooled by the shiny photos this hotel has on their Google and Expedia listings, this place over promises and under delivers.",2,2024,09,22
21,Amazing Hotel,"From the room, to the pool, restaurants and staff, all deserve a 5+ Star Rating. Truly exceptional experience! I will return and highly recommend it for those traveling to Barcelona!!",5,2024,09,22
21,Not as expected,"Basic things in room did not work ( phone, tv, airco) and duty manager did not take complaints seriously. He was pretty much nonchalant and did not want share even his own name.
Not happy about incheck procedure which took longer than expected. Also super busy at breakfast. 
The room was very average nothing special, shower tales would need some cleaning extra. 
Some depo is charged on your credit card, not received that back yet. Anyhow for what the charge? 
Our request to be placed at higher floor with some view completely ignored. 
No outside bar open in the evening. 
Also super busy at breakfast, long looking for table and again waiting to be served coffee. 
Parking charge 30€ per day but if you drive in and out you need pay at machine every time",1,2024,09,21
21,Never again,"Very disappointing- check in took 15. min, pretty arrogant lady. We requested higher floor and were placed and floor 2. 
room average, outdated, apps on TV don’t work so if you want to see movie, no way. Strange sound from fridge or cooling all the time. Very odd and disturbing. 
Phone to reception does not work either. 
Pool small … 
Even ice machine does not function. 
And they charge you deposit for things you could possibly damage …..
Ridiculous, i will be never back . Expensive and worthless.",1,2024,09,18
21,Great stay!,"Great stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona. Hotel is right next to the convention center as has that feel in the lobby. The rooms are small, but well apportioned and very clean and new. We were upgraded to an Eiffel Tower view and it was spectacular!  The club lounge food for breakfast is great and we made a dinner of the night food three times. 

The hotel is a 4-5 minute walk from 3 metro stations and a 25 min walk from the Arc de Triomphe. It’s an amazing value for the price. ",5,2024,09,15
21,Be careful - this hotel charges your account after checking out and doesn’t bother assisting after taking your money,"The hotel lived up to its star rating with its mass produced styled rooms. During your stay, expect to be attended to, but afterward, when the hotel has charged your account twice for your stay, no one will get back to you, despite emails and calls.",2,2024,09,14
21,"Excellent Location, Great Staff, Modern Decor",We recently stayed at this location while on vacation. From arrival to departure the staff and facilities were nothing less than amazing. We opted for club access and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and midday coffees in the club. The location is great and the hop pn and off bus stop was around the corner. ,5,2024,09,14
21,Barcelona Round 2,"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was simply awesome. While farther away from traditional tourist areas it is located in the heart of a major shopping and dining district. The staff was awesome,the bar a great haven - and the coffee shop a gift. ",5,2024,09,12
21,Barcelona Experience,"Not disappointed at all.
Would recommend the trip and hotel and location. Helpful, friendly and courteous staff at the hotel- Grand Hyatt.",5,2024,09,12
21,Staff exceeded expectations.,Staff go above and beyond. Facility was clean and comfortable. Daily breakfast and tapas were excellent. Spa is a bit small and busy—make a reservation. One block from subway which takes you directly to all attractions in Barcelona. Excellent restaurants nearby frequented by locals. Rooms are a bit dark. ,5,2024,09,09
21,A beautiful vacation,"Barcelona is a beautiful city for visiting and vacation. It offers many great sights, food, and entertainment. We love the city so much, especially our hotel, Grand Hyatt Barcelona. The staff were amazingly friendly, courteous, helpful, and professional.",5,2024,09,07
21,"Fantastic property, incredible staff, a real 5 star!","I stayed at this property for two nights while working remotely and visiting friends. As a Hyatt Globalist member, I received all the perks that come with my status. The staff was incredibly professional, attentive, kind, and helpful—making me feel special throughout my stay. The breakfast spread was outstanding, and the restaurant, which is absolutely gorgeous, also hosts a daily happy hour for select guests.

I was upgraded to a standard suite, and the room was spacious, clean, and modern, with a beautiful bathroom. I couldn’t have been more comfortable! The internet was very fast, which was crucial since I needed to work during my stay. The pool area was pretty and secluded, and the swimming pool itself was a good size compared to other hotels in Barcelona. My only recommendation would be to add more lounge chairs, as it can get quite crowded in the summer.

Lastly, the hotel's location is quite good, though not exactly in the city center. There are a few restaurants nearby, as well as a shopping mall, and it's conveniently connected to other tourist spots via the green line, which is just a five-minute walk away.

I can't wait to be back to this incredible hotel!",5,2024,09,04
21,Best hotel at Barcelona,"Amazing experience, staff very educated, fast service at the pool, perfect pool for a summer, comfortable room and very clean",5,2024,09,02
21,Incredible service and amenities,"The amenities, the service, the welcoming atmosphere of this hotel is the perfect place to stay in Barcelona. Located closer to the airport and beautiful walkway into the city shopping areas. ",5,2024,08,31
21,"Great hotel, beautiful views, top customer service",The hotel is in great location with eqsy access to public transportation. The rooms are very modern and beautiful. I wish they were a little bigger but other than that they were beautiful. Customer service was great. The food at the restaurant in the 19th floor was delicious and the views of the city from there simply beautiful.,5,2024,08,31
21,Lovely rooms and great stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The beds were so comfy and the rooms had everything we could need. The spa is such a lovely relaxing experience and worth the 35 euros each. We did arrive in the spa about 240 though and the sauna and steam room were cold. Took until about 3 for them to warm up. Spa opens at 2pm so I would have thought they would have turned them on in advance for people to use. There is bottled water provided but it ran out quick and I didn't manage to get a bottle. No staff around to ask for more.

Although the rooms were amazing, dirty glasses were put back in their place during housekeeping I have never experienced this in any hotel and expect a lot better from one which is 5*. Also old water bottles were put back where we would usually receive new water.
Location is quite a way from the centre of Barcelona but the metro is close by so it's not much of an issue ",4,2024,08,31
21,A pleasant surprise,"When we booked this hotel, we were kind of expecting an average experience.  The room is lovely, we had a little mishap with the lifts on arrival today as you need to select the correct floor outside and not inside.  The pool is delightful, the service, drink quality and food we have found exceptional.   So far, cannot fault the hotel from the moment we arrived.   We are here for a few days and I’m looking forward to the stay.",5,2024,08,29
21,SAFETY OF GUESTS AT RISK,"*Anyone can enter the hotel off the street and try to get into rooms/lounges to steal from guests*

I had a frightening experience here. I was advised to wait in the Club Lounge while my room was getting prepared. Then I was robbed in the Club Lounge. 

-The hotel does not enforce a key card entry in the elevator and does not have personnel checking guests into the Club Lounge. 

-Video showed a plain clothes thief came to the lounge, opened a bag of mine and stole money and credit card. Then he Went to department store and ran up charges.",1,2024,08,28
21,Great Service And Modern,"The hotel was very nice. Clean, modern and the staff were GREAT. Everyone was very friendly, polite and very helpful.",5,2024,08,27
21,Very good but pricey,"A really nice hotel, very clean and rooms are excellent. Facilities including the pool are very good. The breakfast is excellent but very pricey for what it is. Good location for Camp Nou but need to use taxis or other public transport to reach all other tourist hotspots. A minor gripe - the water is only replaced in your room if you are in there at the time!",4,2024,08,27
21,Fantastic hotel with great staff,We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt. We loved especially the rainshower and the friendly staff. Rooms are spacious and clean. Location is +- 30 min by metro from main tourist attractions. ,5,2024,08,27
21,High Five to the Hyatt,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona for one night in August. The hotel has a decent location, with only about a 6 minute walk to the Maria Cristina Metro station and less than a 10 minute walk to Restaurants and shops. The Hotel itself looks modern and stylish, The Check in experience was Ok if a bit long, When I arrived, the reception area was very busy and there were queues of about 5-6 people deep, that said the guy who dealt me was very friendly and professional. 

The room (508) was very impressive, with a nice design, consisted of a separate loo, fabulous separate rainfall shower and dual basins, so it's great for families. The room also had all the usual amenities, Tea/Coffee making facilities, Safe, Fridge etc. and the bed was very comfortable. 

Check out was once again a bit chaotic, there were people queuing everywhere, however the girl who dealt with me was super friendly, so deserves a mention (I wish I had caught her name). 

Overall, I had an enjoyable stay for the one night I was there and would definitely consider staying at this hotel in the future if it stays a reasonable price.",4,2024,08,25
21,Excellent hotel and facilities,"Stayed here for one night pre-cruise. Excellent hotel and rooms extremely well equipped. 

Friendly and helpful staff and located only 15 mins from the airport. We can’t speak for location of city centre as we had no time to explore l, but really impressed with rooms. Modern with some nice light options and helpful sensor lights. We stayed with our daughter who had a separate put up bed and glad to see the room ready and set up for three of us - you would be surprised how many hotels forget this bit! 

Nice design of room too with separate loo, fabulous separate rainfall shower and dual basins, so great for families.

We ate in the Sofia bar, located on the ground floor with an outside terrace; where we had a burger and club sandwich which were good. We also ventured inside for a cocktail - espresso  martini was excellent! 

Breakfast was excellent with so many options. Three stations to choose from of fruit and cereals, pastries and toasts and a hot section which we didn’t venture to. Helpful and attentive staff served hot drinks and continuously cleared up.",5,2024,08,24
21,"Grand Hyatt, and you can never go wrong.","This, like other Grand Hyatts, is truly the best compromise you can find between price and quality. It’s not located in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, has ample parking, and the prices during our stay were absolutely unbeatable compared to other establishments of the same caliber. I spent 4 delightful days here, and the staff is absolutely friendly and kind. Highly recommended without any doubt!",5,2024,08,21
21,Great Hotel!,"Great hotel, staff and facilities. Situated in quiet location with good public transport links to get around Barcelona.  Had a couple of issues during stay, however these were resolved satisfactorily by Erica at reception. Would stay again!",5,2024,08,21
21,Pleasant stay!,"This is my first time visiting Barcelona, and I received a warm welcome at Grand Hyatt Barcelona! I checked in on the day of my birthday, and the hotel sent a bottle of champagne to my room to celebrate it, which was really lovely. As a Globalist member, I also got upgraded to one of the junior suites, which was spacious, new, and cozy. The room service was timely and the staff had responded promptly to my requests (e.g., to fix TV, for amenties, etc.). The hotel is also close to the metro station and shopping center. I'd totally recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona!",5,2024,08,20
21,Management makes mistakes - Give you a bad feeling about,"Very nice hotel and rooms (although a bit on the dark side with the black interior).

Management is terrible. They make mistakes and give you a bad feeling about it when you point it out that it's not professional instead of apologise.

Due to this fact it leaves a very bitter aftertaste and I will not return.",1,2024,08,20
21,Very disappointed,"Fridge was not working
TV was not working
Speakers in room were not working
Telephone had a technical issue almost everyday during my stay
House keeping service was weak and missed providing complementary water bottles almost every time
I raised complaints yet no one actually attended to them
 ",2,2024,08,20
21,Worst customer service,"Had a very bad experience with the hotel. Stayed there in april for 4 nights on a business trip. Accommodation was paid in advance by the company. Upon check in they requested credit card for guarantee, nothing an usual in a 4-5* hotels. After departure i discovered they had charged 1700 euros from my credit card without any notice. I contacted them several times to request information about the charges and was not given any details. After 3 months, countless emails without response and over 20 phone calls they reimbursed me with 1600 euros without any response. 100 euros was probably lost on the way...Worst experience ever",1,2024,08,19
21,Wonderful!,"Great first out of county trip!! 🤗

I will certainly be back with my family and friends, it was our first time tasting duck and it was SURPURB.",5,2024,08,18
21,"5 star for front desk, rooms, location. 0 star for maintenance in the room","We stayed for 3 nights with our kids. Front desk people were great, breakfast was very good and the serving crew was very polite and friendly as well. Being a Globalist, I was upgraded to a suite, and the suite was spacious and beautiful. We had Sagrada Familia view from our suite. 

The problem was the maintenance staff and maintaining the stuff in the room. The whole stay, the phone in our room didn't work. The crew came to fix, replaced, but couldn't fix the phone. Whole stay, I literally had to go down to the front desk for every little thing as they couldn't get the phone fixed. The sound bar was broken and hanging from the wall. Let the staff know at least 3 times, but never saw the maintenance staff. Water came out from the shower area to the bathroom floor as the shower door was not properly closing, again, complained and front desk immediately called the maintenance staff in front of me but they never showed up to my room to fix.",3,2024,08,17
21,Highly Recommend!,"Excellent hotel. Spent a lot of time chilling at the pool, great vibe over the weekend with really friendly and attentive staff. Good food and drink at the pool also.

Check in process was pretty quick and simple and we were provided a free upgrade. Room was very well decorated but there is a lack of storage in the room.

Bed was super comfy and free water and coffee refills everyday which was brilliant.

Bar and restaurants were fab, staff were really friendly and good fun!

On day of check out we were given access to the gym and full shower and changing facilities so we could freshen up before the flight. Very helpful and and great service.

Location is good, although slightly out the city center it’s 5mins to metro and during the day really quiet and peaceful.

Highly recommend and will certainly go back there.",5,2024,08,16
21,Disappointing welcome and service. Terrible sewage smell in the room,"A few weeks before arriving I called the reception to let them know we were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary at the hotel. They told me they were going to surprise us upon arrival. Unfortunately we were disappointed to not find anything in the room. On top of that we had to wait 30 minutes before somebody was able to check us in at 1 AM. And when the person was checking us in, he didn’t provide any hotel information. We had to ask when the breakfast was the day after or else we wouldn’t have known anything. Not the 5 star service you would expect. The room is nice and the beds are great but their is a very bad sewage smell in the bathroom that spreads all over the room. Overall not the best first night and welcome. We are still staying for 4 more nights so hopefully we can change our minds after this.",1,2024,08,15
21,Pretty Good,"It is a clean hotel, and beds are comfortable. Customer service was wonderful, with a few exceptions. Very good location, there are many shops and cafes nearby but it is a bit far from downtown. ",4,2024,08,14
21,not ok for a 5* house,rooms dark and huge bathroom but also very dark. pool was ok but small. expected more luxurious from a house with 5*,3,2024,08,14
21,Wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona,"Wonderful stay at the grand Hyatt. Very friendly and helpful staff. The king room was clean, quiet. Pool area gorgeous. Close to subway station for a quick ride to downtown. ",5,2024,08,12
21,Barcelona trip,"My stay was very nice as the hotel is located in good place, staff was friendly, food and ambience was amazing. Pool side service was very nice . I would highly recommend this hotel for its staff and service ",5,2024,08,12
21,It was a good memory stay,"It was a great stay the location is close to all the shopping brands and nice restaurants. 

The lobby was my favorite part of this hotel and our view from the room was over looking to the city and mountains in the middle of Barcelona.

I loved and would recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,08
21,Watch out before you step into your room,"I found some shiny pieces in front of my room. I thought that’s the design. When I went to bathroom, I noticed they are broken glasses. Hotel refused to change the room. They came up twice to clean the room but still have broken pieces in the bathroom and in the room. I have pictures and videos.",1,2024,08,07
21,A nice hotel,I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona and had a fantastic stay. The hotel was very modern and clean and the bed was comfortable.  I was in Barcelona on business and the hotel was conveniently located next to the office building I was working at.  Some of the other reviews mentioned limited breakfast hours and I would have to agree with them.  I travel to Barcelona several times a year for business and most hotels offer breakfast around 11:30AM but this hotel closes breakfast at 10:30AM which is very early for Spain.  Everyone likes to sleep late and the breakfast area gets very overly crowded at around 10AM.  Hopefully management will adjust the breakfast hours to a later time so that they can better accommodate the hotel guests.,4,2024,08,05
21,Hotel = 10. Location = 6,We stayed in this hotel as my wife was attending a conference. While it’s outside of the main attractions there is plenty to see in the area. Rooms are clean and modern and the staff is fantastic.  If you’re in town as a tourist there would be better options closer to downtown.,4,2024,08,05
21,5 star hotel with a 3 star service,"Location of hotel is beside the nou camp and have good transport links to the city centre, a department store 5-10min walk away and coffee shops close by.

Checkin - Was very poor, we have been several communications fro the hotel that checkin will be from 3pm but when we arrived just after 3pm  only 1 person at the desk dealing with multiple guests meaning we had to queue and wait. It was very disorgnised and while we were queuing, somebody just walked up to the desk and started getting served, there was no acknowledgement that people were waiting and that there was a queue. The world of hyatt checkin was open and the person was just sitting there waiting for someone to checkin rather than see if they can help with other checkin. It took up to 15mins before someone asked if we needed help and if were checking in. This is not I would expect from a 5 star hotel. While checking in, it was explained the us the room was not fully ready, the room was cleaned but the mini bar was not stocked yet and were told that this will be done asap which we said was fine, but when we arrived to the room, there were still dirty cups and empty bottles from previous guests, this was not just the mini bar not stocked but the room was not fully cleaned. So we decided to freshen up quickly and go out to get something to eat. After an 1.5hrs, we went back to the room and the dirty cups were still not cleaned nor was the mini bar stocked. Why tell us to checkin at 3pm when rooms are not ready? 

Room - were put in level 1 and it had a contemporary style, looked nice and had the normal amenities, but there were problems with the room. The USB sockets beside the bed was broken, there was not a main light which meant it was very dark. There are auto lights for the sink which meant it comes on every time you walk past it, so if you need to go to the toilet during the night the lights will come on and wake up my partner and son. The was a big shower but was a bit of a death trap, as the floor was very slippy when wet and I am surprised not more injuries happened as there is not anti slip. One of the sinks were blocked and had to get them to sort which they did. 

housekeeping - not great, leaving empty bins and not replacing dirty cups with clean ones, seems like they wanted us to clean the cups and buy our own coffee.",3,2024,08,04
21,top hotel,"I visited this hotel for the Barcelona - PSG game, and everything was perfect. The prices were reasonable for the period, and the hotel was impeccably clean.

The spa is amazing, offering a variety of interesting saunas. We had a wonderful time, although I regret not getting to the outdoor pool.

The restaurant on the top floor is fantastic, and the bar in the lobby was a highlight. A Romanian bartender made us excellent cocktails and kindly created a new one when the first didn’t suit our taste.

I’ll definitely stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,08,04
21,Best hotel and service,"Outstanding service by all whom looked after us throughout our stay at grand Hyatt 
We stayed at the hotel as a treat for my husband birthday. All the staff looked after us so well and even provided us with a beautiful room upgrade.
The buffet breakfast was absolutely amazing.
Grand Hyatt is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. If you are going planning a getaway in barcelona rest assured staying at grand Hyatt will not disappoint. The most beautiful and elegant hotel. Thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay so warm and welcomed.",5,2024,08,04
21,Highly Recommend!,"I had an exceptional stay at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Barcelona, where I enjoyed luxurious, stylish rooms that were impeccably clean. The amenities, including the lobby cafe, pool, pool bar, and stunning rooftop bar with city views, were outstanding. Additionally, its convenient location near the city center and excellent service made my experience truly unforgettable. Five stars!",5,2024,08,04
21,Limited breakfast times,"Barcelona is a late night city but the hotel has an unusually early breakfast.  The breakfast hours for hotel guests are 7AM to 10:30AM with most guests arriving after 10AM.   Dinners in Barcelona are very late and most leisure travelers enjoy a slower start to the day.  Why not extend the breakfast hours until 11:30AM or noon so that they can accommodate more guests?  Other than the limited breakfast, the hotel is nice.  It is a little bit far from the tourist area so you will need to take a lot of taxis.",3,2024,08,03
21,Stay experience,My recommendation on the room to work on AC temperature to bring it to 20C or 19 the coldest 21.5C in summer is not enough for me ,5,2024,08,03
21,Exceptional,"Quality of food, service, facilities and ambience were second to none. Unbelievably exceptional stay thank you ",5,2024,08,02
21,Not entirely impressed,"Where do I start, I booked a break in Barcelona for my family, it happened to be my Husband’s birthday on day of check in. 

We were expecting a little more for a 5 star hotel.

Check in experience, we arrived just after 3pm, (check in time), there was a queue about 5-6 people deep, but only 2 desks open for check in, and as soon as we were close to the front 1 desk closed, now down to 1 desk, which ended up chaotic as people kept jumping the queue to ask this one person questions, then we were taken to a back area to check in.  At check in they took all our passport to log, and noting that it’s my husbands birthday (but nothing came of it)! Then told room is cleaned but mini bar area is not ready, but we had travelled since 6am in the morning and really wanted to freshen up before we went out for our afternoon activities so accepted the room. 

We went to the room, which I must admit was clean and cool.  Only complaint was one of the sinks was blocked, I washed my hands and the water and soap suds remained.  On exiting we found the ice machine in the corridor, which I thought would be brilliant to fill my bottle with…. But didn’t work! We headed out for a late lunch and let them know of the sink problem. 

On return from lunch we found that they had unblocked the sink, but our mini bar area was not cleaned yet, still had empty bottles and used cups from previous tenants.

We headed out again to the nearby Camp Nou, on return they had cleaned the mini bar area and refreshed.  In a daily basis they refreshed, but never cleaned the cups we used, we cleaned ourselves in the end, but would’ve been nice to have some washing up liquid. 

When I went to have my first shower in the shower I was told my my husband and son they could see me through the glass, there is light frosting, but when the shower lights come on whoever is outside can see into it. The hair conditioner bottle was empty, some days they didn’t change our towels (which is ok).

So, now for the gripes of the room.  There are auto lights that come on with movement, every time someone went to the toilet at night all the lights in the sink area came on 🤦‍♀️ might be useful for some, but we kept waking each other up! 

There are USB ports for charging phones etc next to the bed, two of them never worked on one side of bed, didn’t bother to complain as we had an adaptor and plug.

Swimming pool hours, on check in my son wanted to swim and was told the pool closed at 7pm, later for us to find out it closed at 9.30pm, so we denied him of a swim opportunity on the first evening. The pool opens at 10am each morning, which I found to be a bit late, as we are early risers and would get our swim and runs in at around 8am then breakfast 9am ready for a day of exploring the city. 

Day 5 and ice machine still out of action!  Not really worth the money we paid, we could’ve paid similar money and stayed closer to the centre of town, it’s a good 20-30mins from Barcelona city centre.",3,2024,08,02
21,Barcelona experience,I was impressed with the service from staff as well as the hotel itself. It made my vacation feel like luxury,5,2024,08,01
21,Beautiful hotel offering 5-star amenities,"Excellent staff from the moment you arrive to when you reluctantly must leave. Beautiful pool area, and the loyalty member amenities were very good as well ",5,2024,07,31
21,Great service and hotel. Very Nice!,"Great service and hotel. Very Nice! 
I was very supriced about this hotels great service and sweet staff. Breakfast was outstanding !",5,2024,07,31
21,Relaxing getaway in Barcelona,Highly recommend the Grand Hyatt. Centrally located. The staff is attentive and friendly. The amenities are clean and beautiful . The pool is a relaxing oasis and spa is a must try during your stay. As a Hyatt member you are offered complimentary breakfast which is excellent! ,5,2024,07,30
21,Love the Hyatt,First time in a Hyatt will definitely be coming again. Beautiful 5star hotel and staff are amazing. 5 minutes from metro and opposite shops and restaurants.,5,2024,07,30
21,A classy modern hotel,"Visited Barcelona for 3 nights, this was the perfect hotel for us. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are modern configuration but very comfortable. Housekeeping were excellent. Nice little pool area which was quite busy at times. I am glad we chose The Hyatt over the W which was chaotic.",5,2024,07,30
21,Excellent choice for a relaxing stay away from the tourist madness,"The Grand Hyatt is my fourth hotel experience in Barcelona and i think this one offers the best in convenience and proximity to restaurants and attractions, access to the center city and a relaxed neighborhood feel.  It is not two steps from the Rambla so if you're looking for the tourist buzz, it won't be here.  But in exchange, there are many decently priced eateries, shopping and conveniences nearby, and easy access to the tourist attractions with Line 3 of the metro. 
The hotel itself is  a high rise, with good air con and facilities including a gym and a pool.  The pool is over 20 meters, but so narrow that it's almost impossible to swim laps since there are always so many people in it.  Moreover it is , disappointingly, only open after 10am.
The rooms are as you would expect from a five star hotel-- decent size, well outfitted.  i like my stay here and think that the price is reasonable.  If i have to return to Barcelona, i will stay here again.     ",4,2024,07,29
21,Will stay again!,Grand Hyatt Barcelona is an amazing hotel. Staff were so helpful and kind. Particular praise to Clara who was a delight and upgraded our room as it was my partners birthday. Everywhere in the hotel was incredibly clean and tidy. Breakfast was excellent and the selection was fantastic. Location of the hotel was ideal as the closest metro station is a 5 minute walk and easy access to the best the city has to offer. Highly recommend Grand Hyatt Barcelona! ,5,2024,07,25
21,Perfect stay for first time visitors in Spain,"We chose this hotel for our first tieme in Barcelona. Everything from the entrence to the rooms to the poll was impeccable. everything was well thought of. Even if this is not in the main city and tourist attractions, the location is still great to take the public transportation. Taxis are always available as well. we appreciate the sweet treat provided by the hotel. We felt well cared for and appreciated as guests. We are fortunate to have been gifted the GOH so we were able to enjoy daily breakfast, the lounge and the afternoon tapas. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2024,07,24
21,Fabulous hotel,"A wonderful place to stay in Barcelona. The room, the features, the food, the service, but especially the courteous and helpful staff who go out of their way to provide any assistance.",5,2024,07,21
21,"Very stylish 5 star hotel, in great area with amazing breakfast","Great Grand Hyatt hotel, very elegant, stylish and modern. Room was big and well laid out. Nothing left wanting in the room except maybe cotton buds in the amenity box. Great team members through out who really looked after us, the management in particular must get a high mention. AMAZING AMAZING breakfast in a beautiful dining room. Beautiful pool and garden area. Worth more than a 1 night stay. We will definitely be back for a longer stay. ",5,2024,07,19
21,Amazing 1 night at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona,"My family and I booked this hotel for our overnight stay before our cruise started the next day. Reason being for their great outdoor area and spa. Unfortunately, we did not get to use the spa. This did not matter though, as the room was a spa in itself. From the shower to all the accommodations provided, it was a great experience for one night. The hotel staff from the get was great! From the bell staff to the front desk, we were greeted promptly and with professionalism. The concierge was able to get us reservations at a restaurant near the Sargada de Familia, which we did not use unfortunately, but I just wanted to show the attention the staff had to each guest. And the bar staff and pool attendants were also great. My wife had ordered a drink that was not to her liking and the bar staff replaced it without cost or question for another. Top notch in my book, so tip them generously. I know it’s not traditional to tip in European countries, but believe me they do appreciate it and the respond in kind. I believe in awarding great customer service. And this hotel, excuse my Americanisms, if this a word, knocked it out of the park! Thank you Grand Hyatt Barcelona staff for a wonderful one night stay. I felt at home immediately and that is hard to do when it comes to hotels, as I stay at a lot of them.",5,2024,07,19
21,Five stars experience in every category. Highly recommended!,My one night day as a Explorist Hyatt Member was excellent. First time in Barcelona and Erica made sure I had an amazing stay. Excellent room with view and outstanding food from the Grand Club access. Can’t wait to go back.,5,2024,07,16
21,Nice hotel but breakfast is too early,"The hotel was very nice and the rooms were large by European standards.  The spa was also fantastic.  My biggest complaint about the hotel and the reason that I rated it only three stars was due to the early breakfast hours.  Barcelona is a late night city and most people eat dinner late and have a leisurely start to their days.  The breakfast ends at 10:30 and most hotel guests have to rush and try to get there before closing.  I don’t understand why management doesn’t keep the breakfast open until 11:30 or Noon so that more leisure travelers could enjoy a slower start to their day.  If you miss breakfast, there are no nearby breakfast restaurants within walking distance of the hotel so you’re out of luck.  Hopefully management will extend the breakfast hours, especially during the busy summer holiday season.",3,2024,07,16
21,Grand Hyatt in a Grand Location,This hotel is in a great location with many very good local restaurants. The staff is friendly and competent. ,5,2024,07,15
21,"Great service, beautiful place","The staff was particularly friendly and the overall service went beyond our expectations! A little heaven in the heart of Barcelona, quiet, green and peaceful. ",5,2024,07,15
21,nothing special,check in was slow and the hotel is far from everything also the hotel doesn't provide enough water for the coffee machine you have to ask for it and then they say you have to pay extra also no top sheet just a comforter?,3,2024,07,15
21,Excellent business hotel with good restaurant,"Really good business hotel, but quite far away from the center. Rooms are spacious and stylish with some intelligent, like motorized shades. Restaurant was good, but service was pretty slow. Bar menu was also good, and perfect opportunity to have snack there.",5,2024,07,05
21,Beautiful hotel in a beauty city,"Very clean, very elegant hotel with wonderful food and accommodations will definitely be coming back. Would totally recommend the Peruvian restaurant at the top of the hotel with a gorgeous view.",5,2024,07,04
21,Amazing stay at a stunning hotel,"Our trip was so great. The check in was absolutely wonderful, and we spent some time in the spa, which was gorgeous and relaxing. The view from our room was gorgeous. ",5,2024,07,02
21,5 night stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona.,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona for 5 nights.  The hotel is decent and modern.   The breakfast is quite nice.  It was fresh, tasty and plenty of variety.  Unfortunately our experience did not start on a  positive note. The hotel does not cater for people who do not have a credit card.  They wanted a €300 deposit for room service and the bar. When I said we don't order room service and we don't drink, the manager/staff changed the narrative to its to cover incidentals too. We had to take out €300 from a ATM to cover the same.  The hotel did not care and us just about themselves.  I  visited Dubai last year and we had a similar question posed to us.  When we said we do not have a credit card, the hotel did not make a fuss. 

The gym is okay. Nothing amazing. 
Expected better from a 5* hotel.  The staff who clean the room were very poor. They did not clean the room properly and we were always calling the lobby to ensure the room was cleaned etc.  The TV and fridge kept breaking down.  We did not have TV for the last two days. Another room was not offered.  Barcelona itself is amazing. Definitely one to return again, just maybe not to the same hotel.",3,2024,07,01
21,Great vacation,My wife and I visited Barcelona for the first time.  This hotel is outstanding!  The upscale amenities and the quality of food at the restaurants was impressive. Staff were helpful at recommending local restaurants and sites to visit during our stay.  We had a great time.  I strongly recommend this hotel!!,5,2024,06,30
21,Room dirty and wasted,"Worst Hyatt experience ever.
Bad CheckIn - out of my two reserved Rooms only one was available.
The Room I got was dirty, unchecked, really wasted - „emergency Service“ was offered - In that case, fresh Towels, flushed the Toilet Once, only after my request whats about the Bed - new Pillow Covers (no blanket and so on) unbelivable.
No compensation offered - no excuse.
",1,2024,06,30
21,Great hotel!!,"Classy, modern hotel. Great service! Exercise room was outstanding. Comfortable beds, and fine bedding. Shower was super too!",5,2024,06,29
21,They take advantage of Tourist,"I recently stayed for 10 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Barcelona. I went to ask the concierge where I can get a Taxi and he told me “They are all out of Taxi’s today”. He then said he can call someone for a private car to pick us up. He asked for my room number which I thought was strange and then when he said our car was here, it was just a normal Taxi. The taxi meter said 75 euros when we arrived at our destination, but he charged us 150 euros because he said the front desk allowed him to. Then when I got my room bill, the front desk guy also charged me 150 euro to order a cab.
 
It seemed a bit fishy because when he told me, he pulled me to the side and was whispering that he can get me a car. He called someone on his cell phone to order it. I believe he scammed us out of 300 euro and the taxi driver was his friend.
 
I will be writing a review about this experience as well as filing a complaint with my credit card company for the fraudulent charge. This is unacceptable to take advantage of tourist when we are paying good money to stay at your hotel.

Also, my room smelled like sewage and was told they can not move me.",1,2024,06,28
21,Cet hôtel a bien changé !,"we have come for professional and personal stays several times in your establishment. we have always been delighted and seduced by the friendliness of the staff, the sense of service and the customer experience. this is why we once again booked a stay for the opening of the new Alpine showroom (we work for the Renault, Dacia and Alpine brands). my husband and I arrived in Barcelona later, he came from Paris, and I from Luxembourg. he was at work, I wanted to get the room when I arrived. I specify that I had made the reservation (in his name). a man (with glasses) at the counter on the left took care of me, and refused from the start to give me the room because my husband was not present. I explained to him that he was working and that he would arrive later. I showed him my passport with my wife's name, the photo of my husband's passport, the reservation by email. he asked me for the card, I explained to him that it was a business trip, that my husband had the card and I only had a personal card. I told him to take the reservation card, he didn't succeed. he explained to me that he couldn't give me the room because he feared a story of infidelity! what a lack of respect! I told him to send him a payment link for the entire stay because I had been waiting for 40 minutes! I paid for the stay, he gave me the card. shortly after two other colleagues got their rooms, a man and a woman with whom we work, and this gentleman dared to make a bad joke on them, by offering to put them in the same room, my colleague explained that she had taken two rooms because they are collaborators, and this gentleman told them that it was a shame, that they would have made a good couple! They were shocked by his words! I tried to look for this person's name, unfortunately he doesn't have a badge! know that it damages the reputation of your establishment, and that we will think twice about coming back soon or sending you collaborators! Mr and Mrs Vitali",1,2024,06,22
21,Great hotel!,The Grand Hyatt was excellent. The staff was very accommodating and even upgraded our room. Would definitely come back in the future!,5,2024,06,20
21,Modern and Excellent Staff,"From the moment our taxi arrived at the hotel we were greeted with friendly, smiling and helpful staff and it continued this way for our whole stay. The hotel is very modern, clean and well kept. Our room was bright and comfortable. The location is not in the center of Barcelona but only a 10-15 ride on the subway which is easy very easy to navigate. We would definitely stay at this Hyatt again.",5,2024,06,19
21,Impressed Amazing Stay,"This hotel really impressed me. Stayed in over fifteen 5 star hotels in past 12 months and this is handsdown the best hotel.  With its size this is really impressive. It  starts upon arrival both porters and reception are effective and friendly.  The room is good, extremely clean and such an amazing and powerful shower. The breakfast was great both in choice and in quality. Good coffee, pancakes and fresh fruit. The staff is attentive and recognizes you after day 1, even more impressive when you realize the hotel was fully booked and it was busy during breakfast. Stayed here for 9 nights and really regretted leaving. Definitely stay again.",5,2024,06,19
21,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed one night at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona after a cruise. The hotel is impeccable! Our King Bed Junior Suite was one of the nicest hotel rooms I've seen, and I travel a lot. The pool area was very nice, with peaceful music and attentive wait service. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2024,06,19
21,We enjoyed our stay.,Great value for money. Very friendly staff. Great restaurant to on the Terrace. Breakfast was wonderful. We just wished they had more vegetarian options on the menu for dinner ,5,2024,06,19
21,Great Hotel!,A 5 star experience at a great price. My wife and I stayed here after our cruise. So glad we did. Great access to shopping and train system. Close to the airport. Top notch staff.,5,2024,06,17
21,Business Trip,"Excellent facilities, lovely hotel. The food was excellent and the staff were friendly and happy to assist.",5,2024,06,17
21,Beautiful Hotel,"Great area, rooms were perfect, everything was at our finger tips!  Staff could not be more helpful, and Breakfast was to die for!  honey still in the combs, great selection of breads and made to order food!",5,2024,06,17
21,"AC and elevators broken, bad management",Terrible service. Check is at 3 pm- we booked an euro 800 suite and still when we arrived at 5 pm it was not ready. Elevators were not working so we could only use the dirty service elevator. The AC in the suite was now working and after 30 minutes of repair it continued to not work. The hotel manager was an Argentine who clearly thought she belonged at perhaps a high government position rather than providing a service at a hotel- she didn’t bother to apologize for everything that went wrong. The kitchen staff and waiters were super nice thought and room service food was good. I would still not recommend it or come back,1,2024,06,15
21,Wonderful time at Grand Hyatt Barcelona,"This was a great stay in a great location!  The hotel has been recently redecorated and you can tell.  The room was lovely, spacious, clean and laid out in a really unique way.  The lobby was expansive, the pool and pool deck was very nice with excellent service.  Cava by the pool is always a good idea.  The bellmen were nice and helpful with our luggage.  We had no problem getting a taxi to the airport at the end of our stay. I would definitely recommend and stay here again. ",5,2024,06,15
21,Amazing stay,"Amazing stay, we stayed at the property for 2 days at a Grand Hyatt suite. One of the best and most luxurious suites we have stayed at.
At 17th floor the suite had some of the most amazing views of Barcelona.

Breakfast was great, lot of options with egg station, pan cakes, avocado toasts etc. 

Station on L3 is 7 mins walk, we had a day passes, and it was convenient. 

Club at 18th floor was good too, and the coffee shop at the hotel is fantastic.

Overall a great stay.",5,2024,06,12
21,Not worth the price,"Very disappointed for a 5* hotel. Room cleaning was great and hotel reception staff was friendly, but they were clearly understaffed. Had to wait at reception queues 3x 15-20min, because there was only one or two staff (out of five reception desks) available.
Bar has great wine on display, but bar staff was very inexperienced with wine (broke the cork and took the bottle away, didn't know prices, wine menu outdated)
Location close to stadium and multiple shops in the area, but quite distant from Rambla, Born, Paseo de GRacia",3,2024,06,12
21,Comfy and relaxing,"We stayed two nights at Grand Hyatt Barcelona and had breakfast included, it had plenty of options and worth including. Location worked out for us as we boarded hop-on bus for city tour and stop is next to the hotel. Rooms were clean and well equipped with everything you need. Staff was friendly. Sometimes waiting time on elevators but overall great experience. ",5,2024,06,10
21,Grand Hyatt Barcelona,"I had an amazing stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona. The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, making me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and had a stunning view of the city. The hotel's amenities, including the spa and dining options, were top-notch. The central location made it easy to explore Barcelona's attractions. Overall, my experience was fantastic, and I look forward to returning in the future. Highly recommend!",5,2024,06,10
21,Pre cruise hotel - with nothing around it,"We had a 3 night pre cruise on Regent. Hotel is far from everything ie you can’t walk to any restaurants. You have to take a cab or subway. Elevators are crazy. All “automated” now, we waited as long as 14 min for a lift!",3,2024,06,10
21,Fantastic anniversary weekend stay,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona! We went for a long weekend to celebrate our anniversary and birthdays. After we checked in, the hotel delivered a lovely tray to celebrate our stay, it had delicious cakes and a bottle of cava. We also liked the location of the hotel, it was just a few minutes walk to the underground metro and that line took us to wherever we needed in the city.",5,2024,06,09
21,Really beautiful rooms with a soaking tub,What a beautiful hotel! The rooms are quite spacious and have the most amazing bathrooms - with a soaking tub!  There's also a really lovely outdoor garden and seating area by the pool. The upstairs restaurant has great food and drinks but the downstairs bar menu is quite limited. The coffeeshop is also good for a quick bite. The location is a bit far out but this just makes for a more peaceful stay.,4,2024,06,09
21,Wonderful Hotel in Batcelona,This hotel is well situated but not I. The main tourist area although lots of restaurants nearby and the Metro ( which is easy to use ) is just a short walk away and is relatively cheap and easy to use,5,2024,06,04
21,Excellent Hotel,"Good Hotel . Accommodating staff 
Rooms very nice . Views from the Rooftop bar were fabulous. A little far from the Centre but easily reachable by taxis ",5,2024,06,04
21,Modern Hotel in Barcelona,This is a beautiful hotel. We mostly really enjoyed it. Two of the men who worked behind reception were not always welcoming or kind. But the bell boy Manuel was the star of the show! Always very welcoming with a huge smile on his face. We very much appreciated his energy and he really helped to make our stay a five start experience.,5,2024,05,30
21,Beautiful hotel with fabulous staff,"Our room was beautiful, and the amenities were outstanding. We definitely would stay there again. The breakfast was plentiful and varied, everything was fresh and delicious. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. A truly delightful experience!",5,2024,05,27
21,Great location in Barcelona,"Absolutely excellent location in Barcelona.  Great neighborhood,  away from the madding crowd. Very helpful and professional Concierge team. Good suggestions and advice. ",5,2024,05,26
21,Nice hotel,"Clean, comfortable rooms with a fabulous power shower! Nice bath products and complimentary water and nespresso coffee. Breakfast was good. Very plentiful and good service. Reception and concierge service were all very helpful. My only negative, which is my fault for not doing my homework, is that it’s a bit out of the way if you’re being a tourist. We had to get a bus or taxi to get to the main points of interest, but there was always a taxi outside and bus stop around the corner as well as the metro. Hooks for towels in the shower area would be a good option too but a minor issue.",4,2024,05,22
21,Exceeded all expectations!,"Our company chose the Grand Hyatt Barcelona to host our semi-annual planning and strategy event. The room was clean and well-appointed. The rain shower and hand-held sprayer delivered good water pressure at a comfortable temperature. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, offering fresh pastries, juices, and hot breakfast selections, including some made-to-order. The specialty coffees were a treat. Our bartenders rose to all our requests for specialty drinks, and our company dinner at the rooftop restaurant exceeded every expectation for quality and service. I hope to return and share the experience with my husband. 

Tip: The property is a few blocks away from El Corte Inglés. It's an ideal venue for picking up family gifts, with a basement food court and a grocery with a gourmet candy shop.  ",5,2024,05,20
21,"Nice hotel, great location","Friendly staff, amazing service. The only disadvantage was the cot for kid - so my kid refused to sleep there, and it was easy for him to climb out, so he slept with us in a bed. But that’s solo my kids problem the rest was great. ",5,2024,05,17
21,"Excellent hotel, poor lifts, very expensive drinks, but otherwise great.","Stayed here on a conference, so had 2 full days in the conference facilities and 3 nights.
Hotel is generally excellent. It’s a bit of a way out of town, but adjacent to Nou Camp and also on Avenue Diagonal which is a large road with lots of shops and restaurants on it, all the way into the city centre. So nearby are even chains like Five Guys, and shopping centres.
Rooms very good and very modern with an art deco touch. Tech includes smart lighting and electronic shades.
Very quiet in room and good bed.
Very nice communal areas.
Staff very nice and friendly.
Fantastic rooftop bar.
A few negatives;
- Lift situation is poor, there are just not enough of them, particularly with a conference on.
- The swimming pool didn’t open until 10am- why? Would have liked a swim at 8.
- Drinks were very, very expensive, two pretty standard G&Ts cost me 35 euro which was ridiculous.

But overall very good and nearly 5 stars from me.",4,2024,05,17
21,Great hotel in a good location in Barcelona,"Very comfortable stay at the Grand Hyatt. Staff was excellent and very helpful, and the food was very good especially at the new restaurant on the rooftop. Location was great, a little far from downtown proper but very close to the metro and easy to get around. My only complaint is that the hallways are very loud, there is not really any carpeting in the hallways so noise carries very well. Also the windows were very dirty. Other than that, excellent stay.",5,2024,05,07
21,Wonderful breakfast!,Recent family stay during renaming to Grand Hyatt. Breakfast was a standout with a wide variety of Spanish and international fare. Look for the honey direct from the hive! Much appreciation to Anna who helped us multiple times. She always greeted us with a smile and took care to ask about our activities of the day.,5,2024,05,01
21,Outstanding Service,"Personnel at the Grand Hyatt performed well-above expctations--friendly, effieint, knowledgeable--and surprisingly delightful. Then quality of the hotel itself is superb, but the employees are even better.",5,2024,04,28
21,Above & Beyond,"A totally memorable experience staying at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona.  Beyond our spacious and beautiful suite, every member of the staff were gracious, helpful and provided hospitality services that are ‘work class’.  If you stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona you will not be disappointed!",5,2024,04,28
21,"Overly Modern, Things Don't Work","This is a modern business hotel without much charm.  They have invested in a lot of high-tech electronics that are not user-friendly and were frustrating to us.  For example, there is not a standard telephone in the suite but a modern hand-help mobile without any icons or instructions, so it was impossible for us to figure out how to call the front desk with a simple inquiry.  I had to get dressed and go downstairs where I learned that the bell hop was supposed to teach us how to use it.  It took a while for use to learn how to use the electronic window shades and the various lights.  Nothing was user-friendly.  The coffee machine did not work.  The air conditioning was feeble.",2,2024,04,26
21,Great service in a nice environment,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for business, and was pleased to discover a very stylish, comfortable hotel, that offered good food, and most of all, very personable service. Best place I've stayed in in Barcelona for a long time. ",5,2024,04,21
21,Best for Business in Barcelona,Great service at all areas make the business stay as comfortable as possible. Very nice staff up from arrival to departure. ,5,2024,04,18
21,Name change to Grand Hyatt,"The Sofia just recently changed its name to the Grand Hyatt.  It was a fabulous experience . Distinctive service. Luxurious.
The concierge was very helpful.  The food was delicious.  Great location. Felt comfortable walking the neighborhood.",5,2024,04,17
21,Hotel Sofia - the perfect hotel experience,"My experience at Hotel Sofia was easily the best of any hotel I’ve been to. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel immediately welcome. From cab doors being opened on arrival, bags being taken straight to our rooms, and friendly smiles & hellos, to the extremely helpful reception staff - we could tell we’d made the right decision. 
The rooms were perfect; modern, spacious, huge comfortable beds, and every amenity you could possibly need. 
The facilities of the hotel were also top notch - the bar was a great experience with amazing drinks and attentive staff. The spa was so relaxing, and well worth visiting after a lot of walking around the City! The food and drinks were exceptional - with room service being a highlight for me. Fresh food at all hours, much needed after such long days exploring! 
Overall I can’t speak highly enough of my stay at the Hotel Sofia - luxurious, perfect location, amazing staff, just exceptional all round! If you’re going to Barcelona, you have to stay at Hotel Sofia.",5,2024,04,03
21,Modern hotel with wonderful staff,"The hotel was modern and relatively newly renovated with plenty of USB charging ports. The room was decent sized for European hotels. The staff were wonderful and professional. I had requested for additional water and body lotion, and everytime house keeping delivered in 5 min, very timely, and the staff were very courteous. The breakfast layout was typical of European 5 Star hotels. The hotel is not downtown but near Camp Nou, but the metro is close by, a 15 min metro ride and you would be close to everything. The only complaint is the bathroom layout, there was no place for me to put clean changing clothes. Our flight was in the morning and the hotel let us checkin by 11AM, which was very nice. Would strongly recommend to friends and family who don't mind not staying in the city center of barcelona.",5,2024,04,01
21,Great hotel wonderful staff.,a wonderful hotel. Brilliant staff. So helpful and friendly. Lupe the concierge was fantastic. The food too was great and Breakfast in particular was incredible  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. ,5,2024,03,31
21,"Amazing facility, access from airports/sightseeing, professional hospitality","This hotel is an amazingly brand new and beautiful finishing, we really enjoyed the stay. Since I am a Hyatt member, I was looking for a Hotel to stay with my 16-years-old son. To accommodate two men, two beds are absolutely required so this hotel came up as a top candidate among other Hyatt hotels. The decision was really right, or more than right, the stay brought us more than two beds. The staffs in the reception were friendly to us though we don’t speak Spanish fluently. They helped so many things. I had a concern on my FCB ticket bought on StubHub and I asked them a general advice. The team worked quickly and called FCB official ticket office and cleared my concern immediately. What a cool job. Lastly the location wise it seemed there was a distance from the central historical area, but taking metro L3 line we were able to access Plaza de Cataluña, Saglada Famila and Studio Olympics, and etc easily. The city of Barcelona is more compact than Tokyo, London and NYC there would be no problem in terms of access. I would rather emphasize the good access from the airport. It just took 20 mins from the hotel and costs only about 35 Euros. Remember how much you have to pay from JFK to NYC or suburbs these days. I would have to pay $200~ for large Uber Black. Lastly, we are so lucky to stay their Grand Hyatt rebranding opening day! I can’t wait to stay again, maybe after Camp Now renovation. The price will be skyrocketing after the renovation - I recommend to book early as you can. Camp Now is just a few mins walk from the Hotel.",5,2024,03,31
21,Brings the family very close together,"The hotel is lovely, with quality facilities and friendly, efficient staff. Also, the location is very convenient for the airport, shopping, restaurants and tourists sights. All good. 
The rooms, whilst beautifully finished, were clearly designed by a single man who travels alone. 
The toilet and shower are in 2 separate rooms that open directly onto the bedroom and the wash basin is in the main bedroom. Zero privacy and makes the morning processes an experience for everyone in the room. Needs a sliding panel to afford privacy, if not a complete redesign.",3,2024,03,30
21,Very Good and Comfortable for a Brief Stay,"I only got the chance to stay one night at the Hotel Sofia but was pretty impressed with my experience. First, I'll try to clarify a couple things--while this is listed as a five star hotel it did not necessarily seem to fulfill all of the areas that one would expect from a five star hotel, BUT the price I paid was very competitive and the overall strength of the hotel left me with a very good impression of the hotel in general. 

Strengths: The hotel staff are very friendly, hotel decor both in the public spaces and in the rooms is very attractive and stylish--I was impressed! Very clean, great bedding, good sound proofing with the windows, and I loved the Natura Bisse bathroom amenities. Air conditioning worked well and I also appreciated the bottles of water they provided in the room. 

Areas for improvement: Not enough for me to take off a star from my rating but I would say that the bathroom towels were definitely not up to the standard one would expect from a five star hotel. Thin and scratchy. Sad. The hotel also did not provide turndown service for the room which is also what one would expect from a five star hotel. Exterior room windows were filthy so I'd recommend the hotel invest in some regular cleaning service.

Overall, I really liked this hotel, would happily return as I enjoyed the location too (being a bit outside the very chaotic center of Barcelona), and of course I'd be more than happy to return if the price was as decent (relatively speaking) as it was when I booked it.",5,2024,03,28
21,"Excellent service, decor and location","We only stayed a night, but we'll definitely be back to plan a longer stay. Location was perfect for us, we didn't visit the restaurant as our stay was a short one. The staff were very professional, friendly and jovial ",5,2024,03,26

Everything was perfect 
The breakfast was very fresh and good

Christian make everything to make our tri romantic and unforgettable ",5,2024,03,25
21,Enjoyable stay.,"Very nice hotel, offering enjoyable dining experiences and service.   The staff is gracious and the hotel is immaculate.  For one person the standard room would have been fine, for 2 people on the smaller size.  From my perspective could have been brighter, a quick fix with another lamp.  It was great the room drapes blocked out the light.  The bathroom amenities were high quality.  Because it was on a side street you don't hear all the street noise.  
The drawback is the lack of common space, especially since the room size is limoited.",4,2024,03,25
21,A most wonderful stay in Barcelona,"From the moment we arrived after a long flight, we felt so welcomed. Miguel at the door Is a true gem who always greeted us with a smile and was always ready to assist. The rooms are well appointed. The beds ( including the single extra bed) were very comfortable- it was hard to leave the room to sightsee. The shower was a delight - huge with rain shower and extra wand. The rooms and the entire hotel was immaculate  and very clean. The breakfast buffet had three large sections with fruits, breads, and a hot section with made to order waffles, pancakes and eggs. Emiliano at breakfast was another gem ! Such genuine and sincere service! The staff overall were incredibly welcoming and kind! It is obvious the culture of this place is to provide outstanding service! I will extol the virtues of this hotel to everyone ! And will definitely return when in Barcelona.",5,2024,03,21
21,A wonderful stay!,"A wonderful stay where we were made to feel like royalty from the minute we arrived. All the team are exceptional and one step ahead of guests offering just the right service at the right time. Breakfast is out of this world. The spa is just fabulous and not to be missed. Thank you Hotel Sofia and your whole team, we really did have an unforgettable experience staying with you ",5,2024,03,17
21,Excellent Location Close-Ish to Airport,"Granted, this was a hotel stay using Hyatt points (so it skews one's perspective a bit) . . . and my wife and I were only there less than 20 hours with us heading back to the U.S. the next morning . . . but this is a high-end and modern hotel seemingly for high rollers (which we admittedly are not).  That being said, I could certainly get used to this kind of deferential staff treatment and terrific amenities.  I must further say for the record that our room had likely the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Lastly, perhaps an indictment of many high-end hotels, but it was hard to tell which snacks/beverages/toiletries were included for our use/consumption or were at a cost.  Kinda makes you afraid to touch anything in an otherwise lovely and posh room.",5,2024,03,16
21,Vacation experience,"Awesome hotel. The entire staff was top notched, exceptional experience with the staff and the hotel amenities. The staff was always willing assist in anything to make your stay comfortable. 
Thank you !",5,2024,03,13
21,Above and beyond - both design and charm of the team,"The hotel is upscale and the rooms are designed functionally yet with a premium edge. The team anticipate every need. Lupe was such a delight throughout our time there. And Javier was thoughtful and enthusiastic at check in. Thank you, to the entire team!",5,2024,03,13
21,Hotel Sofia Barcelona,"I had a great stay at the Hotel Sofia. Overall it was an excellent experience. The staff was highly qualified. The rooms were in great condition, very clean. The bathroom was very modern and spacious. The bed was very comfortable with excellent sheets.",5,2024,03,11

21,"Beautiful property, Great Staff!","The hotel is beautiful, arrived very early in the morning and the staff (Karlota) was delightful, she assisted us with our check in and also did all she could to get us a room all though check in was for later in the afternoon. The rooms was amazing, they provide everything, even a mini bar (extra charge of course). Once in the room we were received with a great welcome touch of chocolate roses and champagne. I also visited the Spa and it was amazing!  (Ask about the Massage promotion for guests). Very well located right behind the hotel is the Barcelona team stadium. And the city tour buses pass right by it and is actually a stop. So if you purchase a ticket for the tour buses company’s you are in luck to have a stop right behind the hotel with a short walk. They have a beautiful breakfast buffet with such fresh ingredients everything tasted amazing! Thank you to all the staff keep up the great work, and hope to be back in Barcelona and in this same hotel to experience it all over again.",5,2024,02,26
21,Excellent service from Daniel,"Stayed here over Christmas with family of 4. Hotel is beautiful and well located. What really stood out is the quality of the staff, their friendliness, helpfulness, and knowledge of the city. Absolutely outstanding service from Daniel at the breakfast buffet!

21,Posh hotel!,Lovely hotel - quite posh with nice rooms and  a nice breakfast buffet. Location is good too - not in the old quarters but if you’re up for a 3-4pm walk - it’s perfect. Else take Ubers and taxis - quite affordable. Gym and pool very good. Trip advisor forces me to write more but I’m done :),5,2024,01,28

21,Awesome hotel and friendly staff,"Enjoyed My 5 days stay. Staffs were very responsive and friendly. Highly Recommending to people visiting Barcelona. Rooms were very clean and lovely. Front desk staff, staffs at breakfast, house keeping were very responsive and  friendly.",5,2024,01,20
21,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,Everything and everyone was 10/10. I will definitely come back here and I recommend this 5 star hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Barcelona. The food was also great! This hotel exceeded my expectations. ,5,2024,01,20
21,Good hotel but disappointed with Spa,Good hotel only downfall is you have to pay to use the Spa facilities which I found a bit odd seeing as I was a guest. I appreciate charging for treatments but charging a guest to swim is a first for me and to only allow 1.5 hour use for £30 ,4,2024,01,16
21,"Disappointed as shampoo, conditioner bottles did not squeeze out and hence had to use body wash to wash my hair. This my","Disappointed as shampoo, conditioner bottles did not squeeze out and hence had to use body wash to wash my hair. This my confidence and attitude in business meetings. Expect this hotel to check basic things such as this. Also over charged than reservation price. Really disappointed with this hotel. ",3,2024,01,15
21,A lovely hotel perfectly situated in a quiet upscale residential area of Barcelona,"Hotel Sofia Barcelona is an exceptional place,  a lovely hotel that is beautifully run with old world polish and graceful Iberian professionalism.  I loved my quiet room with a great view over the city out to the sea -so nice.  The area is very attractive too,  upscale residential with lots of nice local shops and places to eat, but still very convenient to Las Ramblas (fun, but too crazy at night) and most of Barcelona.

The Reception staff was really particularly good.  Geri and Javier were very warm and friendly, and impressively professional,  they set the tone for a really nice stay at this hotel.  I was also very impressed that the concierge, a ‘clef d’or’, got up to check me out at departure to make sure there was no wait.  Bravo to the Reception Staff.",5,2024,01,13
21,"Nice looking room, but the hotel needs work","The hotel had nice looking finishes, but was lacking basic needs for a medium to long term stay. We had several problems with basics like WiFi only working within 5’ of the door which never got fixed despite our repeated talks with their staff. The tub also didn’t even have the hot water hooked up when we arrived and then it started to leak from the bottom of the tub. There also would have been great views, but it looks like the windows haven’t been cleaned since summer so they’re really dirty and it’s even worse during sunset when we’d want to see our view the most. Also, the price for laundry is criminal. It would have been about 600 euro for 4 days worth of laundry for 2 people. Also their spa is about 4x the price as higher rated spas nearby.",2,2024,01,10
21,Friendly staffs and beautiful new year fireworks!,"We checed in on 12/30/ for 2 rooms.
The staffs upgrade our rooms to high floor with view to Plaza España. We were able to see New Year's Eve firewroks! It was amazing. The hotel is not the best but the staffs are great! The staff let us know where to find the good food(where locals go). ",5,2024,01,09
21,Great location very quiet and close to subways,"All the staff are very helpful and friendly.  Quiet and comfortable beds. 
Breakfast was ok. Would not recommend pre buying the breakfast. There is so many great cafes close by.  Highly recommended going thru concierge for your visits to local attractions ",5,2024,01,09
21,Great hotel in BCN,"This was one of our favorite properties in Barcelona. From the friendly hotel staff to the great hotel gym, we loved our stay! There was even a New Years Eve party going on when we were there and we couldn’t even hear it!",5,2024,01,07
21,"SOUND ISSUES:  If a restless night is your ideal, then this is the place for you.","This is a new hotel and it is absolutely beautiful  -- aesthetically.   

Unfortunately, it also is property where I experience my worst night's sleep ever --- a sleepless night due to the nature of construction.  The interior designer apparently specified the installation of flooring consisting of large floor tiles (24"" x 24""?) throughout  Accenting the areas around the bed, are beautiful inset hardwood floors.  I have to admit, the floors are stunning looking, but the designer failed to realize that void of any sound-absorbing materials on those floors -- the very nature of those floors is to allow sound to travel through the rooms completely unabated.

Any it's not just a horizontal sound issue, but the sounds appear to travel vertically from floor to floor completely unrestricted as well.   I am usually a very deep sleeper and even hotels at airports, where the sounds of nearby aircraft taking off and landing, it's simply not a problem for me.  At this property, however, I woke up at least a dozen times during the night.   

It appears there is a systemic problem throughout the building.. There isn't sufficient sound-deadening materials implemented when the project was built.  Even conversations of fellow guests in the common area hallways were completely audible in my room.   Unfortunately, my room was also positioned very close to what must have been a glass and bottle recycling area where the housekeeping staff  appeared to be regularly dropping off bags of glass bottles --- these unwanted sounds, courtesy of the hotel staff, made for a terrible night. 

I had a very early flight the next morning out of BCN.  After making two calls to guest services during the night to complain, I finally got up, showered, had a brief talk with the manager on duty, and by 5 AM, left for the airport.

I have to say that I'm reticent to write this as I am a big fan of Hyatt.  I find their properties to be excellent -- offering both a great combination of amenities and service.  This location is advertised a being part of Hyatt's ""Unbound Collection.""  Perhaps it could be re-branded as the ""No Sleep Collection?""   

In my option, this property needs a thorough study by an audio engineer.  I'm certain there is a remedy to this issue, but in it's present condition, the likelihood of someone wanting to return to this property is very low indeed.   I paid $384.63 for this room for one night.  The TRUE value (with no sleep): $0",1,2024,01,06
21,Do not stay here!,I cannot put into words how rude the staff were at this hotel. We made a valid complaint on the first night and we weren’t listened to. I asked for my money back so that I could move to a much better hotel but this wasn’t listened to. I told them that my mother had recently died and they didn’t care. ,1,2024,01,04
21,"Discover Sofia Barcelona, where luxury and exceptional service unite seamlessly","During my recent visit, I was impressed by the attention to detail and the welcoming ambiance. The Iconic Suite offered an unforgettable experience, and the festive decor added to the charm. While the hotel is tucked away from the bustling spots, Barcelona's heart is just a short taxi ride away, making it ideal for those seeking serenity. The Pool and Spa provide a refreshing escape, contributing to the hotel's outstanding score.
 
The staff, from Gari at reception to the concierge and housekeeping team, redefine hospitality with their warmth and efficiency. Sofia Barcelona's true charm lies in its people. If you're looking for a memorable stay in Barcelona, consider Sofia Barcelona. Reserve your stay today and experience a slice of Catalan heaven. You won't regret it.",5,2024,01,03
21,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I would give this hotel 100 stars if I could. Every aspect is perfect: the service, staff, rooms, lobby, dining, etc. The staff are superstars. They treat each guest with respect and kindness. The hotel dining options are fantastic, and their breakfast service is amazing. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and modern. The lobby is beautiful and inviting. We also loved the location, as it was only a 5 minute walk to the metro station. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,12,29
21,It was okay,"I booked this as a family trip on lastminute.com, what appealed to me was the amenities as it had a swimming pool, sauna etc but upon arrival, we found out it was £30 per person for 1-2 hours. We weren’t informed on the website which was a bummer. As for the rooms, it was average, staff was helpful and nice when needing to fix something or change something. However, there’s no bathtub (unless it’s you get a suite or some sort) the rooms are not very family-friendly as the shower you can see through slightly and the same with the divider. Very awkward when staying with family members in a twin bedroom. More of a couples hotel! 

Watch out when using usb port overnight as it was a fire hazard for me! My phone wire completely melted and burnt me slightly when charging my phone overnight, had to throw it away. Also, be warned it’s very inconvenient if you wanna see the touristy spots, far from central as we had to get a taxi multiple times a day as walking was too far. I’m mainly stating the bad sides of my experience, or then that it’s an average hotel. 

Cleaner knocked on our door whilst one of my relative I shared a room in was inside during the evening as she felt unwell, the cleaner was checking every nook and cranny of the room after gaining access with a room key (probably thinking we weren’t in) even inside the toilet for some reason which is not normal. So beware of your belongings just in case! ",3,2023,12,29

21,"Tasteful venue, Excellent Continental breakfast, Great staff","I loved the wood, gold metal, marble  and concrete combination in the design of the hotel in Barca. Very contemprary. The continental breakfast is overwhelming  and delicious. We loved especially the eggs service, and fresh churros. Emilio, the manager during breakfast was just incredibly thoughtful and always offering ' a poquito mas' and staff services were just excellent. Special kudos to Paulo the reception manager who offered a special gesture for my wife's birthday.  The  hotel is very well decorated. The rooms are a bit tight, but in our case that did not matter as we were mostly outside the room.",5,2023,12,18

21,20 yr anniversary stay without Wifi or TV.,"I went to Barcelona for my 20th anniversary and stayed at  hotel Sofia. The hotel itself and our room was beautiful, some with a staff was a bit cold and would just stare at us. Some of the staff was great. Carlos sent a bottle of champagne  and some chocolates to our room, that was the highlight of our stay.  The entire time we were there, the internet did not work and the TVs didn't work. They did get the t v to work on the last day, but only a few channels worked so that put a damper on our stay. The hotel is in a good location,  close to hop on/ hop off bus, shopping and restaurants. We did enjoy the breakfast buffet.  If the staff was a bit nicer and we were able to use the internet/tv it would be a better rating. ",3,2023,12,08
21,Lovely hotel in an upscale area near the Nou Camp Football Stadium,"Stayed at the Sofia for an International Conference in Barcelona. Received a very friendly welcome at the front desk from Andrea upon check-in during a very busy week as there was also a Champions League football game taking place the following day so the hotel and area were buzzing.  The location is fantastic in a wonderful upscale area near the Camp Nou football stadium, felt safe in this area even at night while using the Metro and public transport.  Received top notch service from Oriol when I required some prints for a business meeting, he followed through on his promise and came through for me while at the front desk.  The rooms are modern and updated, quite large for a European Hotel with some nice amenities within the room and around the hotel.  Staff are very friendly and professional.  As an event planner I would have no hesitation booking one of my groups at this location.  A credit to the Hyatt brand.",5,2023,12,07

21,NOT RECOMMEND FOR FAMILIES FROM US,"My husband was paid for through a conference and invited the kids and i to join since it was during their Thanksgiving break.Upon arrival - i was told the company paid only for 1 and asked if i would like to rent out two other rooms which seemed confusing because i have two minors under 13. Perhaps Language barrier played a role.  I explained to him, that i am okay we will pay the difference- he said that is not possible and was stuck on the fact that one person per one room.  I know that hotels in Europe are small but surely not 1 per room .  
I stopped speaking to this particular person since clearly he seemed new.  When i went to next lady i checked in and told her i will pay the difference which was 30 euro pp per night- WRONG! They charged me 75Euro per kid/per night.  Jetlagged and tired i slept strt 48hr - spoke to both event organizer & hotel supervisor and was told that each room can have an occupancy of 3, understood later explaining the charge of for the breakfast per person. (None of us other than my husband ate at the restaurant) instead enjoyed local food in the last ramblas area.  They confirmed they would take care of the charges and i made sure that was the case.  When i checked out- outside the 300 per night the event organizer had paid- the hotel charged me 200 addtional per night extra.  -Fraud-  they told me for the breakfast (never had) or the “TOWELS” which between the 4 of us were given only two.  Nonetheless after the event organzier called them out for the charges they charged me 90 per night instead with tax totaling 300. This hotel was not family friendly- nor a upscale hotel they claimed to be- this hotel should not have the unbound title- i have stayed at 5 star hotels around the world and never was treated like this.  You pay for what you get- in this case we paid but never rcvd the quality.  They even charged 7 euros if you requested things like a fork/spoon or towel.   They were so focused on my little kids and charging them they never told me we could partake in what the hotel had to offer.  We stayed at Kimoton with over 5000 5 star reviews- total night and day- so family friendly and 0 language barrier.  They gave my kids water bottles and so warm and didn’t make me feel shameful for having my minor children in one room.  They have social hour with free drinks for adults and children were offered pop, chocolates and treats.  Other US & European families commented on how clean and customer service is at their highest level.  Rooms were as large as Sofia- but maybe by 50sqft- but the level of service is high level and puts sofia to shame.  SHAME ON SOFIA HYATT IN BARCELONA for shaming/bullying a mom into paying for a charge i dis not agree nor use because of towels and breakfast we never used nor told to utilise.  Don’t stay there unless you are single, barely in the room and/okay w. Invalid charges.",2,2023,11,30
21,Modern amenities and deocr with old world best-in-class service,"Arriving at the Sofia, we were greeted as long lost friends, That caring and concern was evident throughout our stay. No question to staff was too much for the staff in any department. We learned a great deal about the city from staff.

The hotel is brilliant. Modern everything, subdued colour schemes, super beds and comfortable rooms.

Even though it is out of the city centre, a fast cab ride fixes that. 

It will be our home when we come back to Barcelona.  ",5,2023,11,30
21,"Amazing, cannot wait to come back 🙂","I had a truly amazing experience at this hotel. The room was so warm, clean and had an amazing view! The bed was very comfy & the bath and shower were very spacious! 

When we did encounter a minor issue, the staff's responsiveness and accommodation were amazing! They really did go above and beyond to rectify the situation demonstrating a commitment to guest satisfaction. My interactions with the staff, ranging from the front desk and those assisting with luggage, were all so pleasant. Everyone was so kind and friendly during our stay 🙂 the names i do remember, Iana and Uriel (may have spelt it wrong) but their service was impeccable, if i could remember everyone else’s name, I would list them too! 

The presence of taxi services conveniently situated outside the hotel made getting around so easy! and we were not to far from public transport either :)

The desserts at the cafe were amazing and so delicious. The spa was an absolute haven – peaceful, dreamlike, and the facilities were nothing short of amazing. The spaciousness added to the overall tranquil ambiance, creating such a beautiful experience. definitely another highlight of my stay. Cannot wait to return - Thank you all ☺️

21,Excellent hotel for conference experience,"I attended for a conference and as a business hotel this was very good.  The staff were friendly, the food excelent and the room clean and comfortable.  A little out of town for tourism and restaurants but very close to the underground line so could get into old town easily.  The only gripe was noisy guests coming between 2 and 4am which I could hear through the walls, but colleagues didnt have the same issue, so maybe bad luck!",5,2023,11,23
21,One of my favorite hotels around the world,"This was an unexpected surprise. The staff was kind and generous. The cafe was enjoyable and quaint with the atmosphere of a small bookstore.

21,The Staff Makes The Sofia A Great Hotel,"The staff make this hotel special ! Our last visit here, we met Runa who was delightful. This time we met Oriole and Valeria, with whom we enjoyed talking. The entire porter staff was superb- we were here on the night before our Regent Cruise, and they insured we had all the information we needed and promptly took care of our luggage both arriving and departing. The rooms are interesting in their design and we like having the espresso maker in the room.  The breakfast is wonderful!

They did, however, have someone else’s name listed on the television welcome screen 🥲  during our stay. The hardware in the sinks is also is very worn ( the plug is black but used to be brass).  These are small details but for $600 USD a night at a 6 star hotel they tend to matter more. 

Overall it’s a nice hotel. ",4,2023,11,20
21,Great experience,"My recent stay at Hotel SOFIA Barcelona was great. I enjoyed the room, the SPA, and the breakfast next morning. I was also impressed by the receptionist's (Gari's) unparalleled hospitality, reflecting a genuine commitment to ensuring a seamless check-in process and a great stay. He was warm, thorough, and professional. ",5,2023,11,19
21,Exceptional Service with a Smile,"We've been visiting Barcelona since 2003 and can confidently say that the staff at this hotel stands out as the friendliest and most well-trained among all the places we've stayed. Their service is truly top-notch, always delivered with a warm smile. A big thank you to the entire team for making our stay memorable.

However, we noticed that the SPA team could improve. There seems to be a lack of enthusiasm compared to the rest of the hotel staff. It would be great if they could channel the same energy and warmth that make the other departments shine. Despite this, our overall experience was fantastic, thanks to the exceptional service from the majority of the staff.",5,2023,11,12

This time, I arrived at the hotel at 9AM after an overnight flight and was planning to drop off my luggage only.  However, without me even asking, check-in staff found me a room and the doorman gave me a bottle of water!  (I do not have any status with Hyatt rewards).

21,Amazing relaxing time,"I was there for a business meeting so I did not have to go to the center of Barcelona. 
The hotel is perfectly well made, the spa is very nice and relaxing. Breakfast is huge and well done. Confort in the room is perfect. 

Special huge thanks to oriol who changed my stay and made it perfect! ",5,2023,11,10
21,Unbound at the Hotel Sofia Barcelona,"I've had the pleasure of staying at the Hyatt Sofia Hotel in Barcelona many times, and it never fails to impress. It a luxurious retreat.  The staff at the hotel are incredibly attentive, ensuring a seamless and memorable experience. The spa downstairs is a haven for relaxation and pure indulgence.  
 
The breakfast selection at Sofia offers a wide range of choice you don't find easily elsewhere.  The restaurant for dinner & lunch is high quality and a perfect dining choice - which is useful as there aren't a lot of high-end food options nearby / walking distance.

There were a couple of areas for improvement during my stay. The most notable one was the frustratingly slow Wi-Fi, which persisted throughout my visit. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot for performance, and I wasn't alone in this struggle.  The hotel has limited English channels on the TV, and you can't stream content from a phone to the TV. These inconveniences, while notable, didn't overshadow the overall experience.

In conclusion, despite a couple of shortcomings, the hotel makes up for it in every other way that far exceed.   I can't help but love the Hyatt Sofia Hotel. It remains my first choice when visiting Barcelona due to its impeccable service, luxurious amenities, amazing food on premise and the unforgettable Spa!",5,2023,11,09
21,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff, cleanliness of the hotel, amenities provided - all were above expectation. Also thanks for letting us in early as sometimes the travel time does not match with the check in time of the hotels. Even the location was very convenient to get any kind of conveyance - taxi, tram, bus or metro - all were just a small walk away",5,2023,11,06
21,Almost perfect!,"Javier on reception was amazing. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I booked this hotel specifically for the spa, so was a little disappointed when the indoor pool was cold, as was the steam room, so I couldn’t enjoy it and had to cancel my time there, which the hotel reimbursed me for. I had a junior suite and inside the wall in shower there was some kind of black paint/metal peeling off and on the shower floor, which needs looking at. The water temperature in the bath wasn’t hot enough either. So a few little maintenance touches needed to upkeep what otherwise is a very high standard. The hotel has good transportation links. The view on the 16th floor was amazing, breakfast was great with a wide selection. Cocktails were great, and as I was celebrating my birthday it was a nice touch to be given a complimentary cake and lovely message which was waiting for me in my room after a long day of sight seeing. I recommended this hotel to my mum, for when she visits Barcelona, which is very high praise!",5,2023,11,06
21,Very good stay in general,"Beautiful hotel and quiet rooms, kind and welcoming staff.  I had a minor issue with the room and it was quickly resolved.  It would have been a better stay if they’d offered the ability to make local calls (within Spain) from the room, which most hotels do.",5,2023,11,05
21,Exquisite Hotel,The room was truly one of the most lovely I've ever stayed in. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a beautiful hotel. I had a meal at the restaurant 1MPAR which wasn't great but everything else was wonderful. ,5,2023,11,03
21,When a customer service employee makes the difference,"Hyatt has some employees that love the brand they represent and the job they do. This is the case of Erica Salt, a Sofia hotel Barcelona Lobby and Check-in supervisor. When she realized I was not having the best experience with one of the check-in employees, she took over the situation and helped me having a wonderful time at the hotel. My wife and I enjoyed every second at the hotel. The rooms are clean and nice, the decoration throughout the hotel is welcoming you and the breakfast is superb. I highly recommend this property if you have a trip to Barcelona. ",5,2023,11,01
21,"Stay is NOT only the Room, Bed and Bathroom.",Please add proper food in Hot and Cold condition for the Vegetarian persons. And further Radisson should add Reward points for members with proactive approach as it seems Radisson is trying to fleece customers by Not adding properly the points - Why we have to follow up.,3,2023,10,28
21,Impressed!,"Great hotel - modern, well presented and clean.  The food was fantastic with large variety - breakfast is amazing. Staff attentive, helpful and polite, nothing too much trouble. Fantastic and very relaxing spa. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2023,10,25
21,Modern but far from everything,"Stayed here for 6 nights for a work trip. It’s very modern and updated, but the service is lacking and it’s very far from any of the major sites.

Rooms:  B+
Modern and updated, but some things were so modern- like the telephone- were difficult to use.  The windows were also not noise cancelling as you can hear everything from the street. Robes are TINY and barely fit and I’m a thin woman.   The elevators were also not programmed correctly so you ended up waiting a long time to go up or down. 

Food:  C
We did breakfast and dinner at the main restaurant and found the portions small and nothing special.

Service: B
Checkin was easy and everyone was nice enough, but I had to ask 3x for simple things to be addressed.    If you call the main # be prepared for no one to ever pick up.

Location:  B-
Abundance of cabs nearby and the El Cortes Ingles mall is right down the street as is restaurants and coffee shops. But if you are in the mood to do all the touristy things be prepared to spend 20-30 mins in traffic.",4,2023,10,23
21,A 5 star hotel ,"This is a five star hotel in every aspect except it is in a fairly quiet area although a Metro Station is a brief 5 minute walk. The room is excellent, the reception attentive, the breakfast is 5 star, altogether a great experience.",5,2023,10,22
21,Nice modern rooms with great amenities,Modern and efficient. Room was big and well furnished. Good variety of service proposition. All works well and is well maintained.. Efficient and warm personnel. Nice breakfast and wide choice for breakfast. ,4,2023,10,22
21,First class Hotel,"Fantastic location, super staff, classy rooms and an overall attention to detail which made this family trip really special. For anyone undecided about this Hotel, I would day the location could not be better. Your out of the centre, which is wonderfully peaceful, yet your 15mins from the main attractions by taxi which are always plentiful. There's also better shopping centres 5mins walk from Hotel than in the centre, in my opinion! ",5,2023,10,22
21,Great Anniversary Stay!,"Couple from Canada spending 40th anniversary here. Couldn't have been better. highly recommend.
Staff was excellent, very nice room. Hard to plan a stay from far away but hit the jackpot with this choice.",5,2023,10,16
21,Beautiful Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. Everything about this hotel was great (pool/outdoor bar area, the cafe, the restaurant dining, indoor bar, views, etc.) We really enjoyed our staff and appreciated the kindness of the staff and the lengths they went to meet our needs (e.g., Fulfilling a food order beyond available hours).

We would definitely stay here again, but if we chose not to, it would be primarily due to wanting to be located in a different part of the city to avoid being too far away from the beach. ",5,2023,10,07
21,Excellent hotel and a great stay,"Visited and staued at hotel on a conference. Very spacious, great location and a great stay. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Overall a great experience and enjoyed the stay. Would look to visit again in the future.",5,2023,10,02
21,An amazing start to our vacation,"On our two week vacation this was our first city and first hotel. You couldn’t ask for anything better. Our room was so modern and well appointed. My wife’s highlight was a dressing mirror and table in the bathroom with an outlet there. That is a rarity and we travel a lot. 

The showers were excellent. The staff were always there, smiling and ready to help. 

The location is not the city center, which is what we wanted, but the area was so neat, nice to walk, metro was less than five mins, buses right in front and just a 15 mins cab ride from the hustle bustle. We mostly took metro. 

Do not miss the breakfast it was a perfect start to the day especially the lady making the omelettes.  ",5,2023,10,01
21,"Great Hotel, Excellent Staff","We spent four nights at the Hyatt Sofia.  It is a modern hotel and our room was great, with a beautiful view.  
The staff, including the hostess in the morning, was always cheerful and very accommodating.  We’d like to especially recognize Pol, who was extremely helpful.  
The selection at the restaurant is good. The only drawback is the lack of other good restaurants in the area. Luckily it's a short walk from the hotel to the Maria Cristina metro so getting anywhere is easy.
We highly recommend the Hyatt Sofia.",5,2023,09,29
21,Filthy room,"At first I was impressed when walking into my room, until I saw random French fries on the floor. Followed by clumps of hair in the shower and food crumbs underneath the pillow. Throughly disappointed! ",1,2023,09,27
21,Great stay! Amazingly comfy beds!!,"Arrival was very accommodating and lovely customer service. Rooms were nice and modern and clean. Beds were exceptional, such great pillows and duvet and a very comfortable sleep. Especially with the black out blinds/curtains. House keeping was slow but that’s the only thing I can fault. ",5,2023,09,27
21,Premium Hotel with Excellent Service,The hotel was deserved 5 Star Standard with efficient staff and great hospitality. It's in the safe and friendly neighbourhood. I enjoyed staying and going around the city during a week visit there. Thank you.,5,2023,09,25
21,Great Hotel Stay,"This was our first time in Barcelona. We stayed one night before our cruise. Great location, not far from shopping. Close to the airport and to the port. We arrived at the hotel 8:30 am and our room was available. This was great since we had just come off our 8 1/2 hour flight. Our room was very clean and spacious. The staff was very accommodating. Really enjoyed our stay.    ",5,2023,09,23
21,Excellent,"the room was super clean and beautiful... well equipped. the services very good.  the restaurant was very good, the swimming pool too, but I preferred the jacuzzi and the hotel bar. everything was perfect .",5,2023,09,12
21,What a beautiful experience 😍 ,"Me and my husband stayed here for out anniversary it was absolutely amazing,gorgeous room fantastic stuff and thanks for my brother inlaw who works for the company we had some very generous gifts over all our trip was absolutely fantastic and this hotel was sooo gorgeous, pool was fabulous. Staff were amazing ",5,2023,09,11
21,Business Stay at Hotel SOFIA Barcelona,"Nice design Hotel and the price fit's the star rating, perfect breakfast with nothing to ask.
Small outdoor swimming Pool (not to relax due to the street noises) the Spa are is extra of charge, sorry but a no go for that room prices.
Event levels and staff are OK",4,2023,09,06
21,Excellent hotel,Very clean and spacious rooms. Breakfast was good but need few vegan options too. Spa was brilliant. Located near a metro station which is helpful. Staff are really friendly especially the staff at the front of the hotel with advice about getting around the city,5,2023,09,04
21,Worst experience in my life,"The service has been the worst by far.
Last week, we stayed for 2 nights and thank god we did not stay any longer.
The day of arrival we tried to call the reception twice (1hour gap between the calls) and nobody picked the phone in any of the calls.
We arrived at midnight and on check-in we were allocated to a different room without notice.
In the morning we were confused as the room was very different from the one booked in their website. When we expressed our concern, the staff stated that we should appreciate they upgraded us; and we needed to explain that the room was bigger; however, it was not even finished as the decoration was not matching with the description of the room and even more that we both work in the UK as Doctors and if we wanted to pay for a bigger room we would have, however, the reason we booked that room was because we found the design very cool. It was so embarrassing feeling that we needed to explain ourselves for their mistakes. They became unfriendly but accommodating to our request to change to the room we originally booked. However, we wanted a compensation for the hassle. My boyfriend complained to the reception and their answer was: “we have already swap to the room you wanted, what else you want?” So savage
That morning, during breakfast we were allocated one table in the terrace by the waiters in the buffet, we went to get some food afterwards and when we came back with our plates and sat on the table allocated another waiter came quite agitated instructing us that we needed to be moved as that table was allocated to someone else; his approach was not friendly and he did not apologise for the inconvenience. Really embarrassing.
My boyfriend complained at the reception several times about the treatment and they only gave it to him 2 wine vouchers as compensation. We ordered this as room service and it took them 45min to deliver it to the room. We also ordered two gyn tonics on the same order and they brought just the gin. He asked the waiter how he thought we would drink the gin without the tonic and if he thought we ordered two shots.
At night I complained in the reception stating I would like to put a formal complain in the complains book to the hotel as the service is not the expected for a 5* hotel. We set an appointment with the person in charge (Christian) at 10am the next day; however, at 7:30am a member of the staff walked in to our room without knocking.
In the morning with met with Christian and Raul (his superior) and they agreed to give us 1 night for free and 1 night of parking; they also knew about the incident at 7:30am which was very surprising for both of us as we did not inform anybody about this.
On checked out they wanted to charge us for the room service and we told them we would not pay for it due to the whole inconvenience the room service caused at the night and they made me pay in reception for the parking which I did.
On the receipt they charged in the total amount for the parking, 1night in the hotel, and 2 days city tax- I have been on emails with Christian since I checked out asking to refund the parking as I already paid it apart before we left at the hotel and 5 days later I have not received any answer back from him when I provided him the evidence that I have been charged twice.
I am Spanish, it was meant to be our holidays and the first time for my boyfriend to be in Spain; it has been such an embarrassment for me to receive this kind of treatment in my home country in a 5* hotel. I was expecting far more from Hyatt brand however, it is so sad to say that I would not recommend to anybody to go to this hotel ever and I will question myself twice before I book any stay with any Hyatt hotels around the world.",1,2023,09,02
21,First time visitor,"The staff, in all aspects of the operation and service, were amazing.  Food was excellent, and the hotel in general was very clean.  The location is decent, not so far from shopping, sights, beach ... transportation is always available as this location seemed to be a main hub for taxis.",5,2023,08,31
21,A 5 Star treat!,"This is a lovely hotel with stunning modern design. Very comfortable room/bed. Reception/concierge desks tended to be busy and were helpful enough but not overly friendly. In contrast, breakfast in IMPAR was superb and the staff were absolutely brilliant. The hotel is very close to the Nou Camp stadium abut a wee bit away from the main tourist centres. However the Maria Cristina metro is 5 min walk away and gives easy access.  Really enjoyable stay. ",5,2023,08,27
21,Wonderful,The hotel Sofia was modern and comfortable. The staff was helpful and courteous the rooms were larger than expected and the shower was absolutely stunning. If you are traveling to Barcelona for a cruise or any other purpose I would recommend this property ,1,2023,08,27
21,"Overall, a very nice stay in Barcelona ","Overall had a very pleasant stay! I was staying in room 835 which was lovely and the bed super comfy! The breakfast was also amazing, lots of fresh products and choice. 

The hotel is not very central, but with the bus and tube at less than a 5 min walk everything is reachable quite easily, so that was not an issue for us. 

The only issue I would say is the inconstancy of the staff. When I arrived the First Lady at check-in was a little bit rude. When I told her I saw that I was downgraded from a king to a queen she simply said that they are fully book and handed me my room key. When I ask to speak to a supervisor, the lady (I’m sorry can’t remember her name) was super nice! I really felt welcomed, and she immediately fixed that issue. 

The bellman staff is always welcoming, housekeeping staff and restaurant staff were amazing as well! 

Overall, except for that minor incident, I would love to come back for my next stay in Barcelona. ",4,2023,08,26
21,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful sevice","My partner and I spent 5 days at Hotel Sofia and had a really wonderful time. The decor of the hotel was beautiful and the rooms were really interesting, specifically the Sphere bedroom. Unfortunately we were moved from this room due to internet issues, but to our delight we were upgraded immediately! We were also given a bottle of champagne and some chocolates as an apology. Staff were polite, friendly and attentive. The food was also delicious, specifically the steak. If I were to moan about something (and I'm being picky), I did feel that the spa should be free to paying guests, and at 30 euros per guest, per day, the cost adds up. I was also a little irritated that several guests came in to the spa area with their phones and made videos of themselves and filmed the surroundings, not caring if other guests were in the background. I felt that this would be fine in an outside pool, but shouldn't really happen in a relaxing environment like the spa. A complete phone ban in the wellness area would be appropriate in my opinion.",5,2023,08,23
21,By far on my list of top hotels we've stayed in the world!,"I literally loved my stay here! Very elegant and luxurious hotel, not pretentious or snobbish. Everything was amazing! We stayed for 3 nights as part of a company event. Upon arrival, the lobby was inviting with a beautiful scent (so much that I've searched for a replication) and service was prompt and friendly
The room is spacious and well-designed, obviously constructed with expensive materials.
The location of the hotel is not the best for exploring Barcelona - it's about 20 minute's drive to Plaza Catalunya and the same distance to Sagrada Familia - so if you want to explore by foot, I would recommend staying somewhere closer to the city. However, for a football fan, the Camp Nou stadium is literally 5 minutes' walking distance away!
Cafes and restaurants are close by as well, nothing majorly exciting, but decent. If you want a shopping experience, the shopping mall El Corte Inglés Barcelona is 5 minutes away and has a decent food court.
Highly recommended.",5,2023,08,22
21,Nice vibe - expect little to no A/C,"Hotel Sofia is conveniently located, has a very cool and modern vibe, and the most comfy bedding. Philosophia was delicious with friendly staff and the Bar Sofia bar food was enjoyed with local beers. The prices at Impar were out of control so we ate elsewhere ($50 for continental breakfast is excessive). Do NOT expect that you will have air conditioning comfort in your room - our room temp kept climbing until we were awoken by the uncomfortable heat in the room. We had the curtains closed throughout the day and the A/C ""on"" however the temp in the room kept climbing to 27.5°C/82°F during the night. Of our weren't for the lack of A/C we would stay again. ",4,2023,08,21
21,highly disappointed.,rooms were not up to par. shower smelled funky. a/c didn't work up to our standard. a friend of ours had major issues in their room that they had to be moved upon check-in. we've stayed here before and seems like things are going downhill. only upside... the hotel itself is still beautiful. rooms... not so much.,3,2023,08,20
21,Nice property but poor service,"On the positive, nice rooms and facilities. Pool area is nice but overcrowded as high-season so could not really make use of it.
But do not expect 5* experience, service and house-keeping bordering comical.",3,2023,08,14
21,Choose a good 4* instead,"The staff is cold (except for Adrian who is amazing) and unclear. Rooms are not ready until 3 pm, do not make the mistake of waiting as we did (we were not made aware of 3 pm until we waited there for 2 hours on the promise that the front desk was checking for readiness with maintenance). 

The pool is SO crowded (and pretty small) for the number of people, the staff seemed to do a good job trying to bring food and such. Towels were difficult to find, ended up needing to ask. 

At the end of the day, not super close to anything while the stadium is being renovated, very overpriced for what you get if you book direct with Hyatt (found rates for ~$40 cheaper / per night). No perks of being a Hyatt member on arrival.

Other note- there is an automated light system you may want to know about if you sleep light sensitive. Everytime you walk around sensors will turn on lights through the room. I kept waking my boyfriend. ",2,2023,08,14
21,Don’t stay at this hotel - they employ and support dishonest thieving staff/behaviours,Don’t stay at this hotel. Their staff are thieves and the managers are not interested in reports of such. Disgraceful behaviour of a 5 star hotel and I’m still awaiting a response. Don’t waste your money on this disgraceful establishment .,1,2023,08,10
21,Overall a great stay. ,"The hotel is extremely modern and has a great range of amenities available. The staff are lovely and can’t do enough for you. Location is fine if you are happy to travel to visit the many great sites. Public transport is easily accessible from the hotel.  There are plenty local amenities- shops, restaurants, bars, parks. 
I had a few issues- such as my room not being completely clean when I arrived and during my stay, the safety deposit box not working and a socket on the wall being loose, but staff were quick to rectify this.  Unfortunately, I also had to request clean glasses after they hadn’t been changed by day 3 and  the complimentary coffee wasn’t replenished each day. I also had to request water in the gym on two occasions. 
The pool is small but a lovely, relaxing place to sit. However, space on sun loungers is limited and it closes at 7pm. 
Mini bar is unnecessarily expensive and there is a 6 Euro charge to use  a corkscrew (local shop sells them for €3!). 
The hotel rooms have plenty complimentary shower products, dressing gowns, slippers etc, kettle, coffee machine snd hairdryer, but no iron or cups/spoons in order to make a drink. Two small paper takeaway cups are provided which are not much use. 
I would stay again - the issues I had could easily be avoided with more care and attention - I was just unlucky! ",4,2023,08,06
21,Wonderful Hotel,"Beautiful property. AC could be a bit colder and it’s pre set in all the rooms. Nice location next to University of Barcelona. The breakfast is outstanding, don’t miss it! Staff is very helpful. Would absolutely recommend…",5,2023,07,27
21,Horrible nightmare,The housekeeping stole a lot of stuff from my wardrobe while housekeeping when I was out of the room. The hotel manager agreeing that noone entered the room at our absence except housekeeping and still  denying the theft and not helping anyways.,1,2023,07,26
21,awful beds,"Mattresses worst ever and couldn’t sleep and valet rude. They need to disclose charges on top of prepaid.
They need to replace the mattress felt like sleeping on rocks. Wasn’t told about $200 in additional fees till saw bill at check out , I told
About mattress  they didn’t care or acknowledge it ",1,2023,07,25
21,Very smooth,"I had a two-night stay for business trip. Very nice hotel with excellent service, elegant decor and I really appreciated the total black out. A little out of the centre but transport there was very good. ",1,2023,07,22
21,An Amazing Stay in a Beautiful Hotel,"I booked the Sofia Hotel for a few nights just me and my Husband.  

We loved it!

It was our first visit to Barcelona.  So much to see and not enough time so we will most defiantly have to go back, perhaps in the cooler months!

Took a taxi from the airport direct to the hotel under 30 euro,  on arrival our bags were taken from the taxi straight to our room.  Check in was seamless and welcoming. 

We stayed in the Sphere room which is extremely spacious and very modern. Quite the open plan bedroom which I loved, the shower was more like a room of its own and had some amazing  toiletries.  

Everything was operated with a remote pad (one as you enter the room and one on either side of the bed) to operate the lighting, black out blinds and curtains.  The bed seemed really firm but we both woke up the following morning having had the best sleep ever!  

Make sure you book breakfast there is something for everyone the choice and quality is phenomenal!  Staff are on hand with freshly made coffee, cappuccino, espresso however you like it and as much as want.  Breakfast is in the Impar Restaurant, we had dinner there one night which was also delicious. 

This hotel isn’t in the city of Barcelona and that’s why I choose to stay here, we like the buzz of the city during the day with the quiet of the hotel in the evening, and this hotel is perfectly situated for that purpose.  A few minutes walk to either the tram or metro which are both cheap and easy to navigate into the main hub, around 25 mins. 

There is a big El Corte Inglés also only a few minutes walk away, with lots of little local coffee and food places. 

Husband used the gym while I went for a relaxing massage, if you have time defiantly book the spa.  It is beautiful.  The hotel has a small swimming pool which we didn’t use.

The coffee shop in the lobby is also a must. Its completely gluten free and delicious.

The staff are friendly, knowledgable and the housekeeping do an fantastic job to keep the hotel immaculate.   An amazing and affordable 5 star hotel one which I will be recommending and returning to.
 
",5,2023,07,20
21,Weekend in Barcelona,"Very pleasant efficient staff and airy, cool room.  The only issue is that the mini bar snacks and drinks were hugely over priced!  Primarily a business hotel it would seem, buy as it was a weekend stay perhaps more information could be provided about things to do and see nearby. ",5,2023,07,19
21,Fantastic Customer Service,"While the customer service was fantastic, the room we had could have been more in tune with my adult kids' room, which we were told was an upgrade because of the mix up with our reservation/rooms requested.",4,2023,07,17
21,Great hotel,comfortable. The staff are very nice and responsive. Great location and close to tram and metro for cheaper transportation. First time to stay in this hotel and I will definitely repeat this wonderful experience.,5,2023,07,16
21,Not in prime location,"This was my first time to Barcelona and I allowed my loyalty to Hyatt lead us to this location. The hotel is beautiful,.the bed was.one of the most comfortable I've been in while traveling,  the staff was (mostly) helpful BUT the location was NOT in a happening or convenient location. If you are going for fun, hustle, bustle, action......you should plan to spend the extra time and money to travel here or stay in Las Ramblas",3,2023,07,14
21,Highly receommended,"We stayed four nights at this hotel in the last leg of our three-city tour. This Hyatt class hotel was the best of all three hotels (one of them was apparently a 5-star hotel (underserving in my view). The staff members were pleasant, professional and quickly cared for our needs. The rooms were modern and spacious, and the services were also stellar. Two small negatives are that the hotel was a little far from the city center (and, therefore, the rooms cost less) and the rooms needed more overhead lighting. Overall, however, this hotel was excellent. I give five stars in all respects. Thumbs up for Julia (or Juliet?, at the front desk) who was outstanding. ",5,2023,07,12
21,Best Hyatt Hotel Property!,"We had an amazing stay at the Hyatt Sofia Barcelona. Our suite was luxurious and very calming. My wife did not want to leave. All of the staff were very helpful and professional. The hotel was immaculate- the best property we've been to. And I visit a lot of Hyatt properties. This one was extremely memorable. The young Argentinian waiter in the Impar restaurant was excellent,, cheerful, and endearing. The service at this hotel is the best. We will return in December.",5,2023,07,10
21,Customer unfriendly hotel,"This was a disappointing experience. 

We were a family with 4 rooms.  At the check-in, they could not find our reservation for a long time, and even our request for rooms on the same floor was could not be met.

The rooms, bathrooms, were impractical. 

The hotel's objective is to make as much money as possible.  
Despite there being a smart tv, they actively disabled connection - so we have to watch movies for 7 euros. 

Don't allow any connection even for music. 

The last straw was that our 9 year olds wanted to eat yoghurt before sleeping and accordingly we requested for spoons and were told that we have to pay 6 Euros per spoon.  

It is the most unfriendly hotel ever. 

",2,2023,07,10
21,Would deffinately stay again,"Staff all very friendly. Breakfast was first class. Thought they could have given water each day in the room but only offered free on the first day. Prices for the options within the mini fridge were far too expensive. 7 euros for a very small bottle of coke. 10 euros for a palm size bar of chocolate.
Staff could not do enough though. Rooms cleaned each day any issues sorted. If you require drinks go the little bar on the opposite corner. Very cheap.
Would stay again",4,2023,07,09
21,Excellent hotel with great staff,"Rooms were excellent and clean.
Spa was amazing as well. Staff always helped with sight seeing. Me & my wife wanted to do a tour of Barcelona stadium the concierge helped with this. Truly 5 star hotel.",5,2023,07,08
21,Great find,"Lovely hotel, classy and immaculate. Not overly fussy. Great location and good to be away from the hub bub of the Ramblas. Great transport links and close to the metro station. Easy to get around. Staff were attentive and the concierge gave us lots of great tips for dinner and travelling around the city. Close to El Corte Ingles and another very large shopping mall. Great resturant in the hotel and a cafe which serves only gluten free food and pastry. Worth a try even if  you are not staying at the hotel as the coffee was lovely. ",5,2023,07,05
21,"Horrible Experience, Ruined my Laundry and not Customer Friendly","The hotel housekeeping ruined my silk shorts and emailed me that their insurance company will reimburse me and after providing them what they requested they ignored all emails with no response until now! In addition, they are not customer friendly, their bedrooms are dark and when asked for extra lighting they didn’t seem bothered to even accommodate. We had multiple rooms booked and one of them was empty, when asked to get a light from one of the other rooms they said that room is occupied and I explained that is one one of the rooms under our booking and they just didn’t want to help. I’m shocked that this is a Hyatt branded hotel. The fact that they’re not even replying to my follow ups regarding reimbursement shows how horrible the hotel is.",1,2023,07,03
21,Actually 5 stars BUT!,"Really good hotel! We have chosen the Sofia mainly for its infrastructure like amazing pool and gym. Totally worth the price.
Important for us to highlight the hospitality of Daniel poolside, whom we already knew from the W Hotel. 

Down side:
Location, far off the beaten track
Late check out policy: 25% of room price for 1 hour, 50% for 2 hours and full price after that (300€ in average) !!   Although room had been booked as a member",4,2023,07,02
21,Awesome!!,"This was our first trip to Barcelona. We were looking for a quiet hotel with nice amenities. Hotel Sofia went beyond our expectations!!! Very clean and quiet rooms, the staff was extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I would also recommend spending a few extra bucks for the hotel’s breakfast. 5-Star quality. We will definitely stay here again!!!",5,2023,06,27
21,"Sofia Hotel, Barcelona","Amazing hotel, you will not be disappointed! Stylish, beautiful hotel, everywhere was very clean and well looked after and staff were  very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was out of this world! Will definitely return. ",5,2023,06,26
21,"Incredible staff, impressive property, delicious food","I recently stayed at Hotel Sofia for a personal vacation with my husband for our first time in Barcelona. I was extremely impressed with the staff’s attentiveness, accommodations, and attention to detail. It was better service than I have had in a long time. The hotel has everything you need: multiple f&b options, a pool, gym, and spa (we took advantage of it all). Not to mention, the rooms were impeccably designed. I loved my experience here and would recommend to anyone looking for an elevated stay in Barcelona. One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. Thank you Hotel Sofia staff! ",5,2023,06,22
21,Beautiful Property - quick access to L3 train,"We wanted to stay at a more modern property and chose Sofia even though it was a bit further from the areas we visited.  Nevertheless, the hotel was well staffed, well trained and beautiful.  The amenities were top tier and would love to go back there.  The L3 train was a 5 minute walk from the hotel and took about 25 minutes to Licea station.",5,2023,06,20
21,Near Perfection,"This hotel is beautiful. The amenities (gym, pool) are top-notch. The bathroom in our room was stunning. Very large and well-designed with a standalone tub, high-end toiletries, and a massive shower. The bed was super comfy. The only issue we had was the TV would not allow streaming (like from Netflix or Chromecast). The staff at the front desk was amazing, and the breakfast was one of the best we've ever had at a hotel. Lovely visit!",5,2023,06,20
21,Very highly recommended,I have been staying here since over 25 years. They renovated the hotel. Excellent condition now. The rooms are renewed. The beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and classy. The personnel is very friendly. The front desk young lady Julietta was very welcoming and let us feel like at home. Very well trained. The breakfast  buffet was rich and had many varieties. I very highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value for the prize.,5,2023,06,20
21,Beautiful hotel but not central,"The Hotel itself is beautiful and everything fitted to a very high standard but it does have its flaws.
We were in a Harmony room or ‘standard’ ad I was informed by reception.
The room was light spacious, very comfortable bed and pillows however I felt lacked drawer space , yes there was shelving in the wardrobe but only 1 drawer which for those traveling light like us was ok but not for those needing more storage.
The pool area is lovely but the day we decided to have a relaxing day we could not get any sun beds and people were laying on the floor on towels !  I felt it didn’t cater for the amount of people wanting to relax.
On a positive note, the staff were very friendly, courteous, attentive snd worked very hard.
Although not a central hotel the metro snf taxis are easily available big I don’t think this would be my first choice of hotels to stay if I return .",4,2023,06,17
21,Bad status recognition for World of Hyatt members,"This hotel's upgrade policy is really stupid. Arrived, the gentleman at check-in said ""sorry there weren't any suites available to upgrade you to"". Previously, I always had sort of a suite here, with a very large bathroom, and the bed was pretty big, too. The room they gave me this time (which was supposedly an upgrade) was very small and dark. (I'm a World of Hyatt Lifetime Globalist, but neither they nor I ever mentioned my status explicitly.)

Quick look at the app, two types of suites available, called First Wish and Great Wish or something like that. So I went to the front desk and said can't you give me one of those rooms? Made me wait for ages to talk to the ""supervisor"" who was (wo)manning the WoH check-in and dealing with another complaint.

Then she says, no, we have no suites available. I said, but there are these suites? (the price difference to them wasn't even very big from what I had paid). She goes ""no, they are not suites"". lol? ""But they are 'wish'""? I asked, what is ""wish""? She then said she could give me this type of room if I paid 200 Euro extra. But she couldn't really explain what it was. I said if I can book it if I pay the difference, why don't you upgrade to them? I get it, their policy seems to be to only upgrade to whatever the lower level of suite categories is. But she was so clumsy about explaining it, said, Hyatt tells us that's what we must do, etc. blabla. Way to unnecessarily frustrate a returning guest.

Anyway, I said thanks, but no thanks, I'll go somewhere else - she was kind enough to cancel my reservation without a penalty (supposedly, let's see if there will be a charge).

LHW it is for this stay, and I'm done with this hotel.",1,2023,06,16
21,I’m pleased,"We had 7 wonderful days at Sofia. Great location only 5 min walk to metro station. 5 min walk to great shopping. It took about 15 min to get into the city centre. After being in the city, we really enjoyed getting out where there was more peace and quiet. 
Only thing that was a bit down. The weekend at the pool turned in to kids hell. I have kids my self. How ever I respect that people comes to relax. There were way to much noise from little kids, where the parent dident have a look at them. ",5,2023,06,16
21,Exceeded expectations,"I almost reconsidered booking this hotel because it wasn't that close to the areas I planned to visit and I'm so glad I didn't. The hotel is very modern, high tech and clean! We had a ""sphere"" room and it was awesome! My husband still raves about the shower!  We took advantage hotel bar, coffee shop and spa which were all phenomenal. To top it off, they provided us with great customer service and all the recommendations the concierge had were fantastic. I'm definitely looking forward to going back!",5,2023,06,15
21,Wishing I stayed longer than a night,"Excellent customer service -  rooms may be on the smaller side but modern and practical,   Gym was great as well as pool area.   Everybody very friendly and proactive.   Askef for a higher floor room and was offered an upgrade.  Asked for a check out at 1 pm and was offered a 2 pm one.",5,2023,06,12
21,"Property is great, Staff is not","My stay at Hotel Sofia was moderately pleasant. The facilities are clean, spacious and modern. I recently spent 6weeks traveling around Italy so my view may be skewed in comparison but the service was very mediocre. Staff, will not even greet you, if you dont say anything to them first. I found the staff minimally cordial and almost rude. Its not a place I felt very welcome and every inquiry was met with very curt responses. My stay wasn’t horrible enough to cross Sofia off my list completely but I honestly would only stay there again if I needed to be close to something in the area. ",3,2023,06,11
21,Nice stay,"Quite comfortable room. Really functional, I donde miss anything really. The cleaning service above expectations and very friendly. The shower one of the best i have experienced, may make me come back only because of this.",4,2023,06,09
21,Will not be returning.,"Context: I am a globalist member of Hyatt who stayed with the hotel for 7 days, globalist benefits met expectations, did not exceed. SUA was used.

Pros - 

Fantastic Hard Product, really nice physical hotel. Great beds.
Room service was top notch, did a great job cleaning room every day. 

And thats it.

Cons - 

Horrible location.

Had an 80 minute massage treatment. Was initially at 6:30P, they called us at 6:15 and pushed it back to 7:30P. When we got there at 7:30P, one of the masseuses arrived late and was sweaty and huffing and puffing the first 15 minutes of the massage. Not exactly soothing. Massage began at 7:40P and ended 70 minutes later. Got stolen 10 minutes. Since the massage was at 7:30P and ended at 8:30 they refused entry to the spa after, pretty much just kicked us out of the floor after.

The massage itself was extremely uneven in pressure and very painful. Was never asked if the pressure was good. Wife had radiating neck pain for 3 days following.

As compensation hotel gave us 20% off the treatment and offered us to return to the spa without paying their 35 dollar charge the next day, but after this we had zero desire to return.

The manager we spoke to was very dismissive and seemed to act like we just wanted a freebie but it wasnt about the money, it was about the negative experience.

We ordered room service one night and the pork rib dish came and was a pork shank not ribs. I was hungry and ate it anyways. That night I projectile vomited. I was sick the entire next day. It is the only thing I ate that my wife did not, who was fine, so it was definitely the pork.

The breakfast was free due to status which was overall mediocre. Not bad but definitely not good. My wife did try to bring a bottle of water up to the room from breakfast one morning and a male member of staff rudely yelled at her which put her in a very poor mood for the day. We ended up skipping breakfast many days as we felt wed rather pay for a better breakfast outside. 

We asked for a bottle of water to be sent to our room as out globalist water was finished, as I had been puking the night before, and the hotel staff reported we would have to pay. Wow. For water.

Some of the taxi cab employees were very good. Some of them were not very good and would not follow proper line order when calling cabs for people. They do not address you unless you address them first which is not how a hotel should function. 

All in all this hotel was horrible for us",1,2023,06,06
21,Not a good location for tourist - unless you are a football fan,The hotel is quite modern and generally quite pleasant but it is not within walking distance of the main tourist attractions in Barcelona.  The hop on hop off bus stop is only 2 min walk from the hotel but it takes the bus awhile to get to specific tourist spots.,3,2023,06,06
21,A Good 5 Star Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel offered a very high standard of quality for our business trip. The rooms were spacious and clean. Good use of technology for lighting, air con and black out curtains. the bathrooms were clean and spacious. 

The Bed was very comfortable and space in the wardrobes and cupboard met expectations. 

The staff at check in were diligent and communicated well. All staff presented themselves to a high standard throughout the trip. 

The improvement areas have to be:

The lifts - A poorly designed system and not a good use of technology.
Ironing Board - Needs to be in the room
  ",4,2023,06,05
21,Beautiful,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel. Very modern decor, the room had all push button features. The breakfast was unbelievable. The omelette chefs needed a little more training on presentation and presentation, but they were young. ",5,2023,06,04
21,Spoiling a special occasion,"My Wife and I decided to holiday in Spain for her birthday.

Prior to arriving I reached out to the hotel to ask if they could help me arrange some flowers a cake, some candles and to decorate the room with some balloons. All of which I was happy to pay for in order to make the occasion special for my wife.

I was sent a catalog to select from. I mentioned that my wife hated red roses so any other colour would do. I also selected and cake. I was later told that the cake I wanted was no longer available so I had to select another one. Slight issue as the limited options had nothing which my wife would like, but I ordered one anyway because at least she could have a cake with candles for her birthday. 

The morning of our checkin I received an email saying that the flowers hadn’t arrived so they had placed a bouquet of red roses in the room. They very colour which my wife despises!

When we finally got to the room there were 6 cheap balloons placed on the bed. This was a sad, sad, sad birthday arrival.

I’ve been to hotels before where they filled the room with helium balloons and they went out of their way to make a special occasion. Not the people of the Sofia though. 

Worst of all, no candles with the cake. No none of my requirements were followed and I had to pay for this tragedy!

I would have gladly paid extra to avoid a sad birthday",1,2023,06,03
21,5 Star Excellence in Barcelona,"I stayed for almost one week to attend a conference and also too a couple of day to explore the city. The overall friendliness of the staff was excellent. The hotel was in superior condition and well maintained - rooms were comfortable and quiet, food was also very good. I would stay again!",5,2023,05,31
21,Perfect for our needs,"We needed a place to stay for one night after getting off a cruise in Barcelona.  This checked all the boxes.  We were thrilled we were able to check in early.

21,Loved absolutely everything about this hotel!,"From my entrance, until I left, loved every minute spent here, tried the spa and other areas and loved how clean and how well I got treated by the staff.

21,Extraordinary Service and Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights before our cruise and it was a great choice! The service is extraordinary and the hotel is beautiful. There are plenty of bakery’s, coffee shops and eatery’s within walking distance. The soccer stadium is also within walking distance, along with a park to walk through. It’s about a 24 minute taxi ride to old downtown and Gothic Quarter. We will stay here again.",5,2023,05,14

21,Hotel Sofía exceeded every expectation,"This hotel was modern, clean, and the service truly set it apart. 

Check in with Bruna and Julieta were amazing, welcoming, and set the tone for our entire trip with their warmth and professionalism.

Nacho in Bar Sofia was absolutely incredible, and we had some of the best cocktails we’ve ever had (saying a lot coming from Miami with excellent bars and restaurants). He was truly one of the highlights of our trip!

Isaac from concierge set up the most memorable meal we’ve ever had, helped us set up our taxis, gave excellent suggestions, and took the stress out of our planning. He was a huge part of our wonderful anniversary. 

Everyone we encountered from beginning to end went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. Thank you Hotel Sofia staff! The hotel is gorgeous, but the people are what make it unforgettable ",5,2023,05,09
21,"Luxury, safe and reliable property","Highly recommend this property for your stay in Barcelona. We were concerned about the distance to the city but my wife and I got very comfortable with the metra and bus systems which were very close to the hotel to take into the city. Hotel is also great at requesting taxis for you. Overall, rooms were luxurious, bar was wonderful and spa services were great as well. It was also in a safe area so we didn’t have to worry about pickpocketers in the surrounding areas at night. ",5,2023,05,09
21,Great welcome,"A fantastic and wonderful hotel, 
The service was good, friendly and charming.

21,Short stay,"This hotel is perfectly placed within a ten minute walk of the Nou Camp, and has excellent public transport that surround it to easily get into the centre of Barcelona.

Really easy to get in and out, the restaurant and breakfast is really really great, amazing quality and flavour. I know it is not close to the tourist area but that was not a problem at well.

21,Loud,"Ideal location, beautiful building. The biggest headache was the noise and overall sound.The bedrooms were not soundproof.

21,Everything but the service is great.,"The hotel is lovely. Great area. Comfortable bed. Decent bar. Etc. 

However, that doe not include service.

The hotel has a problem - especially if you are part of Hyatt loyalty program.

Zero - and I mean zero - acknowledgement of status.

But - far more weirdly - is their rules surrounding in room provisions.

Apparently this hotel has a policy of no porcelain in the bedroom! Unless you will pay €4 euros a day. (Apparently glass pitchers are ok as they don’t transmit COVID - at least not for €4).

The consequence is paper cups (2) must last a day for coffee/tea Etc. 

Even more bizarre is that is you buy your own cups - they will be removed.

But your own coffee and they won’t replenish. 

I have always given hospitality providers an opportunity to correct an issue. 

I did here as well.

Sadly no one could careless. A myriad of stupid excuses, meaningless promises and - quite frankly - nonsense.

Even on check out there was a promise of immediate contact.

Nothing.

Don’t let this post put you off - just lower your expectations - especially if you’re a Hyatt Globalist for life.

And you have €400 a night to burn.",2,2023,01,03

21,"Oversold, under- delivered, disappointing, poor value.","I wish to complain that the hotel advertisement (main page and facilities) are misleading and have led to a very unsatisfactory stay.

The spa is the main feature advertised on hotels.com, it’s used as the main picture! Yet it isn’t included. It’s €60 extra per day per room and there isn’t an ""indoor pool"" even though it says so on the main page at hotels.com.

The spa is not only a large amount of money extra but also is completely overbooked and unavailable during our 2 night stay. Massages unavailable for 4 days too. Kids cannot use any of the facilities. A total waste of our time and patience as a family.

There's also some service issues in the hotel - kids beds not ready as promised, cleaners who didnt see “do not disturb” signs and woke us, plus bar staff ignoring us for 10 minutes ato do paperwork instead, then [having returned to our room empty handed and subsequently calling room service for a drink] ironically being told to come down 12 floors to check the menu and order. 

Above all, beware the extreme lack of soundproofing in this hotel!! This is a super noisy hotel with almost ZERO soundproofing on its interior. We stayed in a Junior suite and could hear others going to the toilet, cleaners singing their way through their cleaning routine down the hall and slamming doors everywhere! It is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep in, so don’t even consider it.

It shouldn't be allowed for the hotel to use a picture of a spa that isn't included or available and certainly not to write the words "" indoor pool"" when there isn't one.

Hence my very fitting title of this review. I could hardly write “Upselling and disregard for customers” now, could I?

21,"Smooth service, nice hotel, wonderful experience.","The staff were very warm, accommodating and knowledgeable. The rooms and facilities were lovely. The Hotel is very modern and the spa facilities were very nice. Being relatively newly built, the design was very modern, which might not be to everyones taste. But for cleanliness and style, second to none. ",5,2022,12,22
21,BARCELONA SALES MEETING,"Modern and Chic. Great restaurants and shopping close by. Close to transport. Outstanding service
Great location if you don't want to be in the heart of the city. It's next to the university. Hop on op Off bus was 100 meters away so it was easy to get into the main part of the city. ",5,2022,12,20
21,Very disappointing,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 10 days from 2 December to 12 December. Due to our work schedules, we have few holidays of which we can spend together and so had high expectations for our stay in Barcelona and in particular the Hotel Sofia.
It was downhill from the moment we checked in.
We were not given any information about the facilities in the hotel. The room size was exceptionally small despite the photographs on the website. This is something we could cope with, however, what was not acceptable was the treatment we received in the first few days.

We were given one tiny bottle of water to share between the 2 of us. When I asked the house keeping to give one extra bottle, she point blank refused. The way she answered was very rude and just not what you would expect from hotel staff. If we wanted more, we had to pay the 7 Euros from the mini bar. When we requested a glass, or a single knife from room service, we were charged 4 euro each time.  When staying in 5-star hotel, you would never expect to have to pay additional expenses for a member of staff to deliver a utensil to the hotel.  When we questioned reception about this, they said we must pay a service for a service.  In all the hotels we have stayed in across the globe, we have never heard such utter nonsense. It was clear, customer service was not their forte. 

By day 3 of our stay, we were becoming more uncomfortable and decided to take a break from the hotel and leave Barcelona for a few days and pay an additional cost for another hotel.  On returning, the staff appeared to be more friendly and accommodating but this was after we spoke to one very decent member of staff who we believe shared our woes with the other staff. 

The cleaning of the rooms was very poor.  They left dirty glasses in the room.  If we had asked them to bring us clean ones, we would have been charged so we ended up cleaning them ourselves!  On Sunday, there was a knock at the door and within 5 seconds, the door opened. I was coming out of the shower.

One night we ordered room service.  The guacamole was old and gave us both mouth ulcers.  The next day we ordered food from outside but were charged for the hotel staff to bring it to the room.

My husband and I ended up bickering with one another because the holiday ended up being very stressful rather than a time for us to spend some quality time together.

We paid so much for this holiday and it was the worst experience we have had. The majority of the staff were rude and stuck up. The additional fees were incomprehensible. When we visit places, we like to return the hotels we have stayed in but we will never return to this hotel.  We suggest retraining of the staff to ensure future guests don’t have to endure the unpleasant experience we experienced at Hotel Sofia.",1,2022,12,13
21,Paradise in the Barcelona city centre - Extraordinary service,One of the best hotels in Europe with exceptional staffs and extraordinary service quality. The location is ideal with access to key places within the city. The restaurant and bars in the hotel are remarkable. ,5,2022,12,13
21,Good for business !,"Very nice hotel with amazing design. Very nice breakfast and amenities. Only issue is they put me in a room just above their discotheque and I just couldn’t sleep all night until I went down with my luggage at 4am and changed room. Didn’t get an apology at checkout, this is a big hotel which had 200 of us and another group for a wedding so don’t look for too much particular attention as I am not sure you’ll get it. It’s also a bit far from the city centre walking so unless you are a fan of football I would stay the location isn’t the most convenient for an after dinner walk in the gothic area or the beach ! Saying that it’s a nice hotel enough hotel clean and look good to the eye",4,2022,12,08
21,Best Hotel I've visited!,"The hotel is of an amazing standard and the staff can't do enough for you. The design of the hotel is beautiful an very stylish. The room service is 24hr, which was a very nice extra. I will definitely be visiting again the next time I'm in Barcelona!",5,2022,12,04
21,Awesome,"Edit 112022
this was my 2nd trip to this hotel. I sought this hotel out even though it is not the most centrally located- basis my previous experience. It is not too much out of the center of the city- a cab ride gets you there in 10 minutes. We walked it most of the time- and with the nice weather it was lovely. In terms of the hotel- it is near perfect. The rooms are big, the washroom also large (open style fyi). The shower is great. 2 washbasins, a large cupboard and most importantly space to open up 2 large suitcases. Room was clean, the housekeeping was accommodating and overall hotel was good. The only one gripe I have is the lack of enough plug points in the room or in the hotel in general. I was working remotely from the hotel for 3 days. And I worked off the large table on the ground floor behind the reception- though the area was quiet there were no plug points- so I had to keep on going back to the room or to restaurants (outside the hotel). There were no plug points in the restaurants also. Visited 1MPAR the restaurant in the hotel- but only for drinks. The wine was great. Also visited the coffee shop Philosofia- decent coffee. Surprisingly if you sit outside- you don't get wi-fi (or a plug point). Location Next to University of Barcelona & FC Barcelona stadium. Great place for a run which I did. Also next to one of the larger Cortes Ingles - 5 min walk. Because it is in the UB area - lots of coffee shops. I recommend Cups & Coffee and Santagloria. We walked from the hotel most days - to Sagrada Familia, to Las Ramblas- basically everywhere. Long walks- but then it was good fun- saw a lot of the city. Also next to a great mall L'illa. Also recommend Aspic restaurant. Service Outstanding. Reuben and Issac were exceptional. So was the person at the door on the last day who helped find my charging cable- forget his name

Stayed here on a business trip. 4 days. Excellent hotel in terms of service, room size and especially the washroom- large and almost luxurious.

Had some coffee in 1MPAR- decent restaurant. Had breakfast thrice- decent breakfast though they could improve the choice of cereals. Fruit selection is excellent.

The only reason they don't get a 5 star is because the hotel doesn't give adapters for plug points. Instead they expect you to buy one which is available in the room- which usually would be fine but this one was for 120€. It's a really sophisticated one and the receptionist tried her best to sell it to me- but honestly spending that much because I had forgotten mine- just didn't seem right.

Excellently located. Near the underground, 1 minute from a Starbucks and small bars.

Will stay again.",5,2022,11,30
21,Business Trip,Great trip and lovely hotel. Very friendly staff and breakfast was amazing.  Clean rooms and lovely bathroom. Really enjoyed the whole experience and atmosphere of the hotel. Close to a shopping centre and quick taxi ride to the beach. ,5,2022,11,29
21,Favourite Hotel in Barcelona,Fantastic service - and comfortable.  Good location but not in the busiest of locations.  check in was simple and receptive.  Needs were met quickly.  For business and pleasure - this hotel is perfect for both.  Restaurants are great!,5,2022,11,29

21,Beautiful hotel,"Great stay. The hotel is 15 min. from the airport but you need to take a car/bus/taxi to any central areas. The rooms are beautiful, the spa is very sophisticated (well worth the 30 euros), and for the most part the service was excellent. There were a few bumps and complaints about my stay, but nothing that would change my overall rating from 5/5.",5,2022,11,23
21,LOVELY hotel,"Good sized rooms, loved the the double sink and the sensor lights in the (harmony) room. 
The lifts are pretty cool as well as they support social distancing.

21,Just Amazing,"The Hotel Sofia was the perfect choice for our corporate event with more than 350 attendees. The Staff, the service, food, spaces, meeting rooms were in perfect harmony to create an unforgettable experience for our colleagues. THANK YOU to all the STAFF of the Hotel SOFIA. 
",5,2022,11,21
21,Memorable moments to be repeated.,"Sofia is sublime, sophisticated and sumptuous. I loved my stay. A junior suite on the 16th floor proved a veritable joy. The room was spacious, elegant and comfortable. I had two wonderful night sleeps on a bed that was simply gorgeous. I loved the coffee bar, an oasis away from the busy lobby. Amazingly for such a big hotel it felt intimate. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. I would most definitely return and ask for 1614 or similar. Thank you Louis and Josephine - you both went out of your way to make my stay memorable. ",5,2022,11,19
21,愉快的住宿经验,"The team at Sofia Barcelona is great! The experiences of our staying were really good, nice front staffs, the breakfast is highly recommended. Especially thanks to Christian, Isaac, Gari & Michael to sorted our enquiries during our staying. Rooms are cleaned, the facilities are new, the quality of the service were fantastic!!! Closed to FCB, super recommended to choose Sofia Barcelona for your staying. 

我们在11月初的时候入住Sofia酒店，和家人一起度假并且预定了三个房间，酒店的装修很新，房间也很干净，前台和门口的服务生也很nice。尤其是在住宿期间，Christian，Isaac，Gari和Michael有效的处理了我们的一些住宿要求。酒店提供的早餐简直是太棒了，选择很多且卫生干净，Sofia距离FCB也只有500米，强烈推荐哦！",5,2022,11,18
21,Average service…,"Empty bottles were left in the room…For breakfast they provide tap water instead of mineral water and did not declare it…
At checkout the receptionist didn’t even ask how the stay was.
It definitely not reaches the standard of a five star hotel…

21,Excellent comfort,"The room is really well designed, great light ambiance that serves the working vs relaxing time. Super clean rooms and facilities, great breakfast with plenty of choice. The staff is very nice and helpful.",5,2022,11,14
21,By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"I stayed at the Sofia on business for few days in Nov 22. I had never heard of it before but the website photos looked really nice. 

I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and was instantly amazed by the decor and ambiance. I was greeted at reception with a very warm welcome by the receptionist and then was so overwhelmed when I got into my luxury room. Stunning!

Later that evening I received a gift from the concierge with a personal note, it said… “It’s a pleasure to welcome you to Sofia”. This felt very special and at this point I knew this was the best hotel in Spain, especially when the food in the restaurant is incredible.

From the staff in reception, to the restaurant, to the Spa, I have never experienced such outstanding service before in any other hotel. 
I have stayed at many hotels around the world and this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. This is thee hotel to stay at in Barcelona! ",5,2022,11,13
21,No value for money,The check-in took over 20 mins (due to low staffing and seemed to be a regular issue) WiFi was not working properly so I couldn’t run my business calls and I still have no invoice from the stay as system went down. But the rooms are great and staff is friendly.,3,2022,11,13
21,Gorgeous Hotel!!,"This hotel far exceeded my expectations!!  The lobby is gorgeous and has a wonderful coffee shop attached to it.  The rooms are absolutely stunning with beautiful decor and large bathrooms.  If you are going to see a Barca game, very easy walk to pitch.  You can also get on the hop-on/ hop-off bus at the grounds, making it very easy to get around the city.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  I do wish there were a few more reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel.  I found a handful a block away, but was looking for a bit more variety.  There is a very nice restaurant attached to the hotel, but I did not stay long enough to eat there.  I HIGHLY recommend staying here, and plan to stay again if I return to Barcelona.",5,2022,11,09
21,GREAT STAY,"The hotel is modern, the staff were professional, and the location is great. A shopping mall is within walking distance and you’re close to the soccer stadium. I highly recommend this hotel. Everything was perfect. ",5,2022,11,08
21,Location and  room were excellent but reception staff were not accommodating to forgoing nationalities.,"Amazing would definitely stay, as long as the staff slowed there pace when speaking. Having to ask someone to repeat themselves after an answer or a question can be rude and tedious. Location is stunning

21,Exceptional Hyatt Globalist Experience,"Touring Europe with my parents, we booked two rooms at Hotel Sofia for a short visit to Barcelona. Having stayed at multiple Hyatts in Europe, I have to say our Globalist experience at Hotel Sofia surpassed them all. The open, contemporary style, the spacious rooms with smart technology, contrasted the smallish, older (albeit cute) boutique hotels we've stayed at in Europe. I soaked in all the amenities that I could during my two-night stay and didn't want to leave. I have to give special shout-outs to Reuben and Erik for their exceptional service. 

Upon our arrival, Reuben checked us in. He was fun, courteous, and very informative, explaining all the hotel has to offer and answering every question, including ways to get around the city and best time to be at the airport. To our delight, both our rooms were available before 10 am. As Globalists, we were automatically upgraded to So Suites without even having to ask. The So Suite rooms were stunning - sprawling views of the city, big comfy beds, spacious bathrooms with deep soaking tub, and powerful shower. The breakfast offered a vast spread of meats, cheeses, fruits, pastries, along with hot foods, including made-to-order omelets. There's a self-serve espresso station and latte/cappuccino can be ordered at the counter. With some time to spare, we quickly checked out the spa just before it closed for the evening. The nice lady at the spa gave us a little 'taste' of everything (jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, etc...) - I wish I caught her name. 

Here's where I have to recognize Erik, Front Office Supervisor.  As my husband and I departed for the US, my parents were journeying to London for a few days, then returning to Barcelona alone. Given our wonderful experience at Hotel Sofia and its convenient access to the metro, taxis, and Hop-on Hop-off busses, I booked another stay for them at Sofia through Hyatt's Guest of Honor program. Hotel Sofia stored their luggage, so they could travel light on their venture to the UK. My husband sent a brief email to Hotel Sofia, simply reminding them about my parents' luggage and when they would be returning. Erik replied promptly, not only assuring us their luggage will be delivered, but that their room was upgraded, that they'll have a spa pass, and can enjoy complimentary breakfast with Guest of Honor benefits. To our surprise, mom and dad texted us yesterday to tell us they met a young, sweet gentleman named Erik when they arrived at Sofia who warmly welcomed them back and had everything prepared for their return. Thank you Erik and thank you Hotel Sofia!",5,2022,10,29
21,Our Stay at Hotel SOFIA Barcelona,"The Hotel SOFIA Barcelona was an excellent choice for our stay.  Our room was exceptional.  The internet was high speed.  The restaurant provided us with great selections for lunch and breakfast. The staff at all levels were helpful, courteous, cheerful, and spoke English with ease!   It was a great stay!",5,2022,10,10
21,Terrible service,"We stayed here for 2 days after a cruise, we booked it as we wanted a place to sit by a pool and relax, when we got there the pool was shut, winter they said, it was 28 degrees. We were over charged for our room. The staff basically said not their issue ring booking.com. Service terrible, had to wait for 15 mins to be served in the bar even though we were the only customers. The bed was rock hard and super uncomfortable.  The only good thing about this hotel was the shower. Never have I had such poor customer service in a hotel.",1,2022,10,07
21,Excellent hotel!,"Great place to stay! Modern, stylish rooms, very clean and well maintained.  Public areas including Bars and Restaurants also impressive.  After an early flight we arrived at noon to ask if could leave our luggage until we checked in ar 3pm. However, Eric on Reception told us we could check-in then if we wished. Although all the staff were pleasant and helpful I'd like to make a special mention to Eric, an extremely nice guy who is a great asset to the hotel. Thank you Eric! All in all we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Sofia and would strongly recommend it!",5,2022,10,02
21,Poor experience,"This hotel is definitely not a good choice. It's expensive, the rooms are quite small, the windows are full of dust, plus room cleanliness is peculiar, outdoor swimming pool is way too small and for the indoor pool you have to pay 30euros per day per person although you had already paid for a 5 stars experience. On top of all , the concierge and reception staff contribute to an unpleasant experience, they are always bothered by any question. Definitely for the pricing they offer other hotels have bigger and cleaner rooms and the staff is making the difference.",1,2022,09,28
21,Luxurious Suite in a Nice Barcelona Hotel,"We stayed in a First Wish Suite and were very impressed by its size and comfort. We had a comfortable king size bed with easy access to controls for lighting and blinds. There was also a small dining area in the room, which made it very comfortable for us to eat during our 5-night stay. The bathroom was huge and had every amenity with separate stalls for the toilet and the shower (although there were no locks on the doors). There were two sinks and a bathtub as well. The hotel has a small pool with lounge chairs and also has a spa. The spa was only open from 3 - 8 PM and it was difficult to get treatments there; however, the amenities of the spa were excellent. There was a large indoor pool with many different features, a sauna, a steamroom, an ice room and a salt room. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We loved Isaac at the concierge! The main reasons that I gave this hotel ""very good"" rather than ""excellent"" was because of the location. It was not near La Rambla and the old city of Barcelona. It was easy to take the Metro to get to the central areas, but we did not have the experience of being able to walk out the door to the center of town. Additionally, I felt that the lobby was small and did not have the feel of a 5 star hotel. Overall, this hotel has many excellent features and I would recommend it.",4,2022,09,13
21,Lovely hotel,"The room was lovely, and the breakfast was really nice with a lovely outdoor area. The pool is in a beautiful garden and is very relaxing. Concierge was very helpful and recommended two excellent restaurants.

The draw back was the housekeeping, they would always miss something every day. Once they left a cleaning towel and another time a whole bag of rubbish.",4,2022,09,13
21,Great experience,"Travelling to barcelona several
Times a year.. tried this hotel for the first time. And booked it again for my  next trip.. only downside that i wanted to try the spa.. but it was closed the day i had time",5,2022,09,13
21,Amazing stay!,"I have recently returned from a short city break to Barcelona with a friend (4th/7th Sept) and what an amazing time and stay we had a Hotel Sofia! It’s definitely the nicest hotel i’ve stayed in so far for a city break and I will be recommending and returning in the future for sure.

Check in was efficient, all the staff at the hotel are so friendly and attentive. The decor at the hotel is stunning! It’s so modern and clean.

Our room was lovely, we booked a Harmony room (room 308 for reference). The decor again was stunning, the room is such a good size and we had everything we needed! We had requested an iron in the room which was their on arrival, there was robes/slippers to use and a proper hairdryer (not a travel sized one which is what you usually find in hotels). The mini fridge is expensive so we popped to the supermarket and stocked up on snacks. Housekeeping were great, they came everyday and the room was immaculate.

The bed was the comfiest bed i’ve ever slept in and the shower was amazing, so powerful! The only downside I would say is that the shower is very see through which is fine if you are staying with a partner, but if staying with a friend/colleague or family member this could be a bit of a problem. There is a screen that divides the bed and shower area which does block it off but not completely, this could be different however in a twin room? We had a double so maybe that is why!

We didn’t have breakfast or dinner at the hotel as we ate out for our whole stay so can’t remark on that, although the restaurant did look lovely. 

We spent our last day by the pool which was so nice! After having two full on days in the city it was lovely to be able to chill before catching our flight that evening, all the facilities were still free to use even after we had checked out. We were able to use the spa/gym facilities to shower and change before leaving too which was great.

The location of the hotel was perfect, the metro a short walk away which takes you straight into the city, taxi’s are everywhere around the hotel and if you choose to do the Hop On Hop Off bus while you are visiting one of the stops is right outside the hotel.

All in all a fabulous trip, I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Barcelona and I’ll be returning myself if I return in future.",5,2022,09,08
21,Very nice hotel near Camp Nou stadium,"We booked a room at the SOFIA because we had tickets to the Barca-Man City friendly and wanted an easy hotel to walk back to after the match. It was a great hotel for this purpose but the hotel itself is actually quite nice. We tend to like older classic hotels but this one is very modern, in a very tasteful way. It was the highest tech hotel of any that we stayed in during our 3 weeks in Europe, and we'd definitely stay there again if we were going to a Barca match.",5,2022,09,05
21,Unacceptable to charge this much for what we got,"The rooms have names: is Harmony better than Sphere?  Need 2 rooms, 1 with somewhere nice to sit. Chose Infinity room. Web site said a First Wish Suite was ""A spacious junior suite capable of satisfying every possible wish, thanks to its exclusive design, impressive views of the city and the access it provides to the privileged ""As You Wish"" services of the private club."" 
The seating area in the suite & Infinity room were identical. 2 chairs by the bed & no way to see the TV. There was a table and 4 chairs like a meeting room. The view was not to the city but the suburbs. The club was permanently closed.
The bathroom was great and room had 5* amenities like a fridge with a small bottle of water for 7€. There was no suitcase rack but a strange seat where you could balance a case.
The web described the Be So restaurant as  “An exclusive gastronomic restaurant in Barcelona with an intimate ambiance and excellent service. An authentic ode to the senses. An explosion of colours, aromas and flavours inspired by the great classics, which are reinterpreted to create an authentic culinary experience full of delicate nuances.""  It was permanently closed.   The Impar restaurant had a great menu on line ""Sorry, the a la carte menu isn't available just this much smaller set menu."" 
We stayed in New York at a 5* place. They too had problems offering services. They told us beforehand and discounted the price as a result.  

1 final complaint: 5 min for the lift wait was usual, once I timed 8 mins.

21,Newly reconstructed hotel,"Newly reconstructed hotel with a modern design. 
Good location next to a metro station. Close to the Nou camp stadium.
We loved the design of the room. The staff was polite.
The hotel has a nice small outside pool.",4,2022,09,01
21,Good hotel with some minor issues,"This hotel is in a good place and walking distance to public transport. Not to far from the center and close to couple of restaurants and starbucks  

This hotel has excellent spacious modern rooms; the hotel is well-maintained with lovely staff. 
The bed was really comfortable

The check-in and out process was so slow because the hotel was really busy. 
I liked the breakfast buffet. It was really nice and worth paying for that. 

The main problem with the hotel is that for everything you should dial number 9. There is no separate line for reception, housekeeping and room service. That is why it isn't easy to talk to the right department. I often had to call many times to get a response. 
The room dining was not great. They don't have good food, but when I complained about the issues with my food, they cancelled my payment, and that was proper customer service. 
Overall, I liked the hotel and I might go back there again in future",4,2022,08,31
21,Love Barcelona and the  Hotel SOFIA,"Great place to stay in Barcelona. Located with easy cab rides to everything. We also were able to walk all the way to Eixample District. We stayed in the First Wish Suite on 17th floor with an incredible view of Barcelona and the coast!. What a suite! beautiful and comfortable. Delicious restaurant. Breakfast was incredible! Pool lovely but too many families and people were in town when we traveled. So it gets crowded enough not to have a chaise lounge or chair to be able to enjoy pool. Bar service was great inside. Lovely, lovely three night stay while we toured the beautiful city. Highly recommend the Sofia.",5,2022,08,29
21,"Stunning property and rooms, unbelievably terrible service.","Forget about your Globalist benefits, the hotel refused to honor the complimentary breakfast even though my name was labeled as 'Globalist' in their system. Per the elite status, I requested a suite upgrade at check-in, which we did eventually receive, but after we kept inquiring about it each hour while we waited. Finally got our room 2.5 hours after check-in.

It's a shame the service is so bad because the property is stunning, the food is great, and the rooms are elegant. The hotel is a short walk away from FC Barcelona's stadium—perfect for a fan experience, but be prepared for pre and post-match crowds in the bar. ",2,2022,08,24
21,A wonderful experience,"We recently stayed at Hotel Sofia for 5 days for my partners Birthday. The whole trip was fantastic.

The Good: The pool and pool bar area. Super clean and stylish. The loungers are comfortable, and the food and drinks great. The pool is quite small, but a very welcome addition. Tip: get down early if you want a lounger. Although staff do remove the towels after a while from those loungers that people have tried to reserve and left, so they do become available.

The Very Good: The breakfast was awesome, such a wide selection. On occasion the hot buffet food was a little bit cold, but it was refreshed very often. And the chefs would prepare omelettes on request. The servers kept coffee cups full and fruit juice aplenty. The welcome to breakfast by the hostess each day was so warm, and she even wished my partner happy birthday without prompting. A lovely touch.

The Excellent: All the staff are so helpful and friendly. They couldn’t do enough for us. Special mention to Isaac (thank you for the great restaurant recommendation with Mirabe), Bruna on check in and reception. She is a delight. And Kasia in the Spa. I recommend  booking spa treatments and making use of the amazing spa while there. We booked in advance. The spa only opens currently from 3pm. 

The whole hotel is very stylish. The lift system takes a little getting used to, but is very slick. And the rooms are tranquil havens, kept very clean by the housekeeping team. 
The location of the hotel is a little way from the centre of Barcelona, however there is a metro in very easy reach. We got taxis so easily from outside the front door, and they are very reasonably priced. So don’t let location put you off. Unless you expect to step out the door and be on La Rambla or in the Gothic Quarter straight away.  

Thank you Hotel Sofia for making a birthday trip extra special. The addition of the candle as a gift from the spa, and a little birthday cake in the room were so welcome and a classy touch.",5,2022,08,22
21,The best hotel we've ever stayed in,"Everything about Hotel was absolutely amazing and luxurious. We were amazed from the moment we stepped out of the taxi. The atmosphere, the staff, the guests, restaurants, the pool side, the SPA. It was the best hotel we've ever stayed in. 10/10 experience and trip of a lifetime for us",5,2022,08,19
21,A lovely place to stay,A beautiful hotel with an excellent customer service. The only downside was the broken kettle on arrival (strongly recommend to do a quality check before handing the room over)  and issues with the sliding door of my bathroom.,4,2022,08,15
21,"Looks nice, but poor service","The hotel looks really nice and it’s close to Camp Nou. 
The problem is that the staff can’t handle the amount of people coming though during summer season and they don’t seem to care about service.
From the moment that we tried to check in our family of 5 with three kids (incl a 1-year old), there was just mistake after mistake. 
I’m a huge Hyatt fan, but management needs to make service adjustments.",2,2022,08,15
21,Worth every star,Faultless and made our experience feel luxurious. We will 100% be rebooking back into Hotel Sofia. The hotel is everything that it states to be. Our room the 'King sphere' had such an affluent feel to it and we looked forward to heading back to our room each night. The location was perfect. ,5,2022,08,12
21,Incredibly Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this hotel, we chose it because it seemed to have a bigger outdoor space than most of the hotels in Barcelona including a large pool area (we were very much mistaken)! They just haven't got any of the basics right;

. There were about 8 members of staff in the lobby when we checked in & only 2 people checking people in / out. This meant it took 15-20mins for us to check in.

. The walls in the rooms are so thin. We were kept awake both nights. On the first night by one of the rooms playing music until midnight & on the second night by a family checking in at midnight & finally going to sleep at 3am!

. The sun lounger situation is ridiculous. They tell you at reception the pool opens at 11am (it actually opens at 10am)... you have to start queuing at 9.30am to even get a chance of getting one of the sun loungers. The pool is tiny for the size of the hotel & its full of people sat on the floor on towels (I have never seen this at a hotel before).

. The beds are rock hard & pillows are absolute crap, they give you one massive one & one that's flat as a pancake.

Positives;

. Really good large shower

. Nice use of technology in the bedrooms

. Decorated to a really high standard",2,2022,08,11
21,Amazing,"They accomodated our needs so well, the staff was very friendly and very helpful- we had some uncommon requests, they handled everything very well. The room was beautiful (Sphere- it was even better than the pictures) and the breakfast was delicious. ",5,2022,08,10
21,A Truman Show hotel,"This hotel is the real ""Truman Show"" experience. You enter the lobby and you have at least 10 members of the hotel staff, each ultra nice, smiling, saying ""Hello"" etc., but when it comes to check in (or out) you feel like Truman buying a trip in a travel agency - it seems like everybody is trying to delay it as much as possible. I cannot understand why it has to take so long to give somebody a key to the room, why they have to inspect all the passports for 10 minutes, do some endless clicking in the keyboard etc. The result is that you have a 5 star hotel with a super-duper fancy intelligent elevator management system and an ultra old-style reception service with half an hour waiting time to check in or out.
The hotel has also a very odd parking management system. I have never seen a hotel in which in order to leave the parking you have to exit the car and go to a guy sitting in a booth, tell him the number of your room and show the bill for the parking (which you pay at the reception). Again, I cannot understand why they cannot simply give you the exit ticket at check out.
The room I got was impressive  - nice deco, great shower, modern interior etc., but the window was so dirty I could barely see anything outside, and I mean really dirty, like not washed for months, a bit of a shame.
Otherwise a nice hotel, a bit away from it all, except if you want to see a Barca game at Camp Nou - the hotel is walking distance from the stadium. 
PS. One more thing about the parking. It says maximum height 2,10 metres, but in fact some parts are much lower, so if you drive a tall car or have a roof rack - pay attention!",3,2022,08,09
21,Isolated and lacks Hyatt standards,"Positives:
Staff friendly, bed very comfortable, room had a stylish look.  Cafe was a real shining point both with staff and what was on offer.

Negatives:

Very slow check in and out. 
Isolated location and doesn’t make up for it in other ways 
Pool has limited space and you have to get there early to stand a chance of using it. 
Restaurant food limited and on the whole not that ground breaking.  Breakfast very expensive. 
Room ok but not completely clean.",2,2022,08,09
21,Staff is too good.,"Hotel is very nice and clean. Best part is the staff they are too good and helpful. 
Only disappointment is with food although the food taste us up to the mark but the quantity is very surprising. The quantity they provide will not even be sufficient for a for 5 year old child. ",4,2022,08,04
21,Very nice,"It’s a nice hotel, the staff always help us and gave us suggestions of where to go. Access to public transportation  where to go. Access to taxis, public transportation was very close. It was a nice stay.   ",5,2022,08,01
21,Fantastic except for our front desk check in process,"This hotel is beautiful and rooms are fantastic.  A pity check in was slow and ft desk clerk attitude unacceptable.   Its a shame because otherwise i would rate a 10.   This one guy made it all wrong.  To be fair, the rest of staff, including the second ft desk clerk, were fantastic. ",4,2022,07,31
21,Modern hotel on Diagonal,"Great hotel. Recently renovated and modern rooms. We also visited the impar restaurant and the food and service were outstanding. 
The rooms have very modern lighting equipment including automatic curtains. The swimming is small but very convenient.",5,2022,07,26
21,Excellent Hotel!,"Great customer service! Room very nice, quick check in and check-out, good location. 
I didnt have any problem with comunications btw my room and front desk. I like breakfast at the Hotel, I like interior design, warm and elegant. 

",5,2022,07,25
21,Looking good on the surface but...,"Quite unwelcoming/unbothered check in on arrival. Chaos at the lobby as lifts did not work properly - in fact, they were inoperative for the rest of our stay, and we had to go down 6 floors by foot. 
The pool looks great on photos, but the fact that there are around 20 sunbeds is hard to understand. Guests were lying on the floor everywhere, not looking like a 5* at all. The fact that the pool opens at 11 am was also rather disappointing.

On a positive note, the rooms have clearly been refurbished recently, and the outcome is great.",3,2022,07,22
21,Pity the decision makers/designers let the staff down. Pool water filthy and cloudy.,Taps turn wrong way.  Faucet splashed our clothes  Toilet door would not close toilet door handle broken. No vanity kit such as cotton wool and we were in the higher grade rooms.  Pool water cloudy grey and dirty which is disgusting unhygienic and totally inexcusable and unacceptable especially in light of the covid suitation and the spread of germs.  Despite all this staff were so so lovely. Pity management let them down ,2,2022,07,21
21,Great room and incredibly clean but below average customer service,"Great hotel in decent location - 5 minute walk from metro. Awesome Breakfast, very spacious suites and CLEAN, mordern. Reason it’s a four star is customer service needs to improve to really make it a 5-star ",4,2022,07,16
21,Facilities are nice and the staff friendly but understaffed,"Sofia decor is up to date and the staff are nice when they are available but they are not always available. The swimming pool somehow only opens at 11am which means if you are on business, you have no chance for a swim - it's also very small so when you do get there it is likely to be filled already. The worst experience came from the Hyatt app. Don't use it to ask for anything at the hotel. I don't understand why they call it ""concierge"" when the response time is 5-6 hours for the chat - not even action. I am not sure if I will put myself through the Hyatt experience again...",2,2022,07,16
21,"Broken blackout curtain and window, switched us to a smaller room and didn’t adjust price.","Our room had a broken blackout curtain and a window that wouldn’t shut. They sent someone to our room at 10 pm at night, couldn’t fix it, then put us in a smaller, less expensive room, but didn’t adjust the price. ",1,2022,07,15
21,Fabulous stay,"Very impressed with the hotel overall.  The location was perfect for us for our short stay to see a concert in the park and also access the city with the metro nearby.  The hotel check In was very efficient ( a special mention to the gentleman who checked us in (and out next day) he as very friendly but professional.  I wish I had made a note of his name!  We were very pleased that both rooms were ready when we arrived and also that our room preferences had been noted and accommodated so thank you! The staff around pool were also very friendly and took time to deliver excellent customer service despite being busy. 
We will certainly stay here again.",5,2022,07,03
21,great property ordinary service,"Lovely property but not Hyatt service. The GM is indifferent. You have to pay for the spa, strangely.The hotel charges for a bottle of water even. the hotel doesnt respect the globalists of world of Hyatt really. The coffee shop closes at tea time that is 6 pm.",3,2022,07,03
21,Poor value of services,"Spa was a supplement while there was no mention of it as being a paying service during booking. Staff was unable to help, everything was so disappointing. No water or coffee refills every day. Breakfast service so average, especially in the kitchen area. Not a large selection of foods.   Would not recommend. ",1,2022,06,29
21,Nice Hotel but Small Room for a Big Price,"I recently stayed here while on a business trip.  The hotel is very nice and has many amenities and several dining options. I was a bit taken aback while sitting in the lobby when I saw a trail of ants moving by my foot -but, hey that is Spain.  It is relatively close to some good dining options and an easy walk to many others.  I was a little take aback by the small size of the room but I was by myself. It might be a bit more challenging if two or three people were in the room.  I was also surprised that they did not have an ironing board in the room - I guess I am just used to them being in the room as I travel a lot and usually press my shirts to get out wrinkles.  My in-room phone did not work - I called the front desk and would start to talk and I could tell the person on the other end could not hear me - after the 3rd time where she hung up, I knew the phone was not working at all.  I asked someone in the lobby to send up an ironing board and an iron and they quickly did so.  Overall, it was a good place to stay but the price was a bit steep.  The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to a train station and there are other public transportation stops just down the street.  You aren't very close to the main Barcelona attractions at this hotel but you can easily get a €10 train pass and get to many of the Gaudi sites that are further North in the city.",3,2022,06,25
21,Overrated,"I expected better service according to the price. 
The check-ing was too slow. They try to charge me with a car park service that I did not use when check out.
I had to ask for amenities for my bathroom. Only hand soap available.",3,2022,06,22
21,Perfect,"Great hotel with very friendly and efficient staff. The rooms are very modern
The hotel is quite large and has several areas to dine and relax
Overall a very tidy and well maintained property just a short distance from the key places in the city",5,2022,06,21
21,Beautiful decor but service and amenities not up to 5 star standards,"Beautiful rooms and hotel but things are not up to 5 star standard in my opinion.
A/c did not work properly (had it on 15 degrees for 6 days and room was still 22 degrees)
Pillows very soft and there is no pillow menu
Have to call reception multiple times in order to reach them
I had booked for 4 nights with work and a cheaper room on my own budget for 2 additional nights - I checked in and they mentioned they’d keep me in the same room (nice gesture) but in fact I discovered in comparing with my colleagues they had downgraded my room for the first 4 nights to match with the lower budget last 2 nights booking (not cool, especially if you don’t inform me).
Reception staff is rude - locked me out of my room because I had not paid a 17 eur laundry charge (i had paid the 3000USD room charge…) which I felt was rude. Did not help me carry my bags from my room when I changed room. ",1,2022,06,20
21,Worse Check in experience in this specific property of Hyatt since despite of being member on World of Hyatt.,"Worse Check in experience in this specific property of Hyatt since despite of being member on World of Hyatt, the check in staff didn’t give any attention and respect it. I reached to the property early morning at 2:30am for check in and checked out at 8:30am on same day to catch next flight but staff rejected my early check/check out request. ",2,2022,06,18
21,luxury hotel not at all,"we got a room where there was already a couple inside. no wellness services included, bad service in the restaurant of the swimmingpool (slow, expensive).
absolutely not a right ration between quality and price",3,2022,06,14
21,Disappointing Experience,"We arrived by taxi from the airport around 7pm on Friday night: When we walked through the front door we noticed a ton of people in the lobby, all looking to be checked into their rooms. There were hardly any places to sit. When we talked to the front desk attendant he stated that the entire Hyatt computer system was down and they could not check our reservation or take our credit card and passport information. We were asked to wait until the lobby area until an attendant could take use to our room. The staff were all super nice and apologetic but they could not give us a room key card so we had to have someone walk us up to the room every time until the computers finally came back up around 10pm. On top of this they put us in a handicapped accessible room, which the layout is specifically for people in wheelchairs. I’m guessing the staff chose this room for us because they knew no one else was staying in this room and wouldn’t have to check in the system. The room and the bathroom were both a bit awkward for taller people. The bed was also really low to the ground and it kind of felt like we were sleeping on the floor. Based on our experience we would not chose to stay here again because of all of the issues we had.",2,2022,06,13
21,Very nice stay!,"Would definitely recommend staying there.
The only thing not so good is the area the hotel is located - which is not really at the center of nothing.

The breakfast is super delicious and the staff is very welcoming.
They have an amazing Spa & the rooms are comfy and new!",5,2022,06,12
21,Amazing Hotel,"Such a magnificent hotel.  For as large as the hotel is, it still feels like a cozy, boutique hotel.  The Staff are tremendous.  Breakfast was good.  The staff at breakfast were great.   The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable.   Location is in a quiet neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle.  Very easy to get taxi's in the area and so it was no issue getting a ride to the main parts of town.   Hotel is a short walk to Nou.  I truly enjoyed my stay an would happily return.",5,2022,06,07

21,Great hotel,Great experience in the Hotel SOFIA in Barcelona. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are specious and very neat. Location is a little further from the city center / harbour but easy accessible.   ,5,2022,06,07
21,Amazing 5 star hotel with amazing staff,"Amazing hotel, super friendly staff, very clean and luxurious hotel. The pool has a good temperature and the sun-beds are very comfortable. The room has all the facilities you need. And it is very spacious. This is my favorite hotel so far. No long lines at the elevator because the elevator has an automatic system. Just tap on the pad for your floor and it will come directly. Also the location is perfect, near the beach and near many restaurants. Also very close to public transport which brings you in Barcelona shopping area within 6 mins.

Price and quality is perfect. We will come back soon with our baby. Because this hotel is super kid friendly as well.

Major thanks to the hotel manager Susan. She solved our problems with so much grace (flight got canceled) she made sure we could relax and that we could let go of all the stress that the night brought us. We are forever thankful for your understanding and your peptalk.",5,2022,06,05
21,"Nice hotel, but lacks the finer touches","Hotel Sofia is a beautiful hotel. Location isn't the best for sightseeing, but is close to the metro and many buses. There are however a few issues with it:

1) Suite upgrade for Hyatt guests: As a Globalist, I typically get upgraded to at least a standard suite, if it's available. However, I was upgraded to a So Suite, which is a grade below the standard suite, First Wish, as listed on the Hyatt app. When I asked the front desk at check-in, they claimed that these were the same, which didn't sound credible at all. I also verified that the First Wish suite was available when I checked in.

2) Shower door: There are gaps around the shower glass door, so the water would splash out of the shower, making the rest of the bathroom really wet. I had to place multiple mats outside to soak up the water. I was just taking a regular shower and not splashing water around...

3) Aesthetics over pragmatism: The design of the hotel seems to place aesthetics over pragmatism. For instance, the tap was impossible to turn if your hands are wet or soapy.

4) Environmental sustainability: I wish the hotel would place more emphasis on environmental sustainability. There's nowhere in the hotel where you can fill up your bottle with drinking water; your only option is either the tiny disposable plastic bottles in the room or tap water. I was initially quite pleased that they used larger sizes for the shower amenities to reduce waste, thinking that they provided that because I was there for four nights. However turns out that they used that regardless of your length of stay, as I got a new set of amenities on my last night.

5) Breakfast spread doesn't change: The breakfast spread is incredible if you're there for a day, but can get really boring if you're there for four, as the spread is the same every day. They have an almond croissant that is really good (with cream filling), but ironically, they don't seem to have that everyday.",3,2022,06,04
21,Wonderful,Very enjoyable stay in stylish hotel with great amenities and cuisine. The amenities are fantastic. Food is delightful. Service was great. Very comfortable beds and gorgeous bathrooms. Mini bar was rather minimal but other than that a perfect get away. ,5,2022,05,30
21,Not a 5 star experience.,"Staff has a bad attitude and gave false information. Clientele is not 5 star worthy destroying the ambiance for everyone else. Spa cost extra, nobody there to take care of luggage or car, pool packed as in not a single bed available. No service.",1,2022,05,27
21,Beautiful,One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Great staff. Breakfast is amazing with lovely choice of hot and cold food. Our bathroom was one of the best I have seen in any 5 star hotel. On a beautiful street with great shopping nearby. Wonderful @,5,2022,05,25
21,Understaffed,No service after 22:00 in the restaurant. It was not possible to get a bottle of wine and two glasses on the terrace. I had to contact the hotel manager. He recommended that I have to go to the bar and take it from there. Unbelievable ,1,2022,05,25
21,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel, everything was amazing. The decor, cleanliness, comfort, customer service, everyone was so friendly! Absolutely loved it! Was a little pricey but worth it!",5,2022,05,24
21,May 2022,Only stayed here for one night and it was the best sleep of my entire Europe trip. Room was amazing and beyond clean. Service was amazing . Gym and pool were beautiful. 5 min walk to metro  line that took us downtown and only 15 mins drive from airport. When I return to Barcelona I will most deffintly stay at Hotel SOFIA ,5,2022,05,24
21,Worst service for a 5* ever worldwide.,"Terrible food service. No meal took less than 2 hours, orders were mixed up. Some orders had to be taken more than 2 times because they forgot to register. Then after long wait they came to say that what we ordered was not available in some cases.

Service was like that transversal across all restaurants, for a períod of 3 days.

Room bathroom hotel is saving on furniture, no place to put your bathroom stuff.

Chicken curry with no chicken, just vegetables!",1,2022,05,22
21,Good but lacking the finer touch,"The hotel was lovely. However the staff often were not very attentive it took over 20 minutes for check in and the delay was not acknowledged or apologised for, for the price paid I’d expect a better level of service.

The hotel also seems to have large events often staying and it it not designed to cope with large groups and also providing a high level of service to other guests therefore long waits for lifts and breakfast can be expected ",4,2022,05,15
21,"Beautiful property, great location",Wonderful a d enjoyable first time stay at the Sophia. Staff are very friendly and proactive to customers needs. Easy ten minute walk to the stadium to watch Barcelona FC. Short drive to Sagrada and other famous sites. Highly recommended. PD2YVR,5,2022,05,04

When my airline (Aer Lingus) has decided to lose ALL 4 of my family’s luggages and my father’s walker, the concierge helped chase the airline, get them back to Barcelona, and return to our rooms… this took a lot of pressure from me on my family vacation, when I have to take care of my elderly parents.

I can’t thank the hotel enough in looking after our needs and providing a fantastic experience!  Truly 5-star, and other hotels should take point from the Sofia.",5,2022,04,28

21,First visit to the Sofia,"The whole experience at the hotel was absolutely superb from check in to check out. The staff, the service, the food, the car park.

21,Three stars hotel with lack of maintenance and staff.,"I was really disappointed with the poor performance of this hotel. I was there for a week. As soon as I got into the room, things look good, but after no time you will realize that they have staff shortage and maintenance. Room Service took two hours, sink was clogged, windows were dirty, 40 minutes line up to get Breakfast, 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar. Nothing compared to other Hyatt experience to be honest. The only positive thing is that Restaurant staff was friendly and the gym was good. That on the side, it should be rated as a 3 stars hotel. ",2,2022,04,13
21,excellent hotel and staff,"the hotel is very impressive and tastefully designed.  Bedrooms are great .. spacious and very comfortable.  Location is very accessible and there are restaurants and bars in the area but not as many as in central Barcelona.  The only thing that could be improved is the F&B I would expect something more unique and varied, but quality was fine and service excellent",4,2022,04,12
21,MATRESS HORRIBLE & UTRAINED STAFF WHO DONT KNOCK,"When you remove the sheets to see why you are so uncomfortable, you will find that they have placed what they think is a mattress cover, but is actually something that resembles an old bumpy, unevenly distributed ball of mess. It feels like you are laying on a big pile of dirty clothes. Unacceptable for such a pricey hotel. One of the elevators was on the verge of breaking and I feel bad for the people who's rooms were nearby because it sounded like a space ship launching into space. Dried up wax all over our floor. Broken faucet in the bathroom. About 15 minutes after we got to our room, an employee barged into the room without knocking and we were in the middle of an intimate moment with no clothes on. He waited at door and insisted that we needed to check out. WTF!!!?? Honestly this hotel has a lot of potential because its quite nice and the customer service was great, but it's lacking in many other areas. Hopefully you will not have the same experience as we did. We will not be back...it's going to always be ""The One"" or ""ABaC Hotel""....",3,2022,04,07

The amenities that they give you are good and with a variety of stuffs to use and consume.
The laundry service is amazing as well and they make sure you receive everything in the best conditions. 
The breakfast is really good, a variety of foods and they all tasted amazing. 
The location is incredible, the neighborhood is safe and modern, with lots of restaurants and shops to go, and the ""hop on hop off"" buses have stops right in front of the hotel. 
If you are planning on going to Barcelona, this is the hotel to stay, I promise you won't regret it.",5,2020,02,19
21,Noisy club in the basement makes it hard to sleep,Hotel with great staff and nice location. Unfortunately someone has decided to place a club in the basement.

21,"Beautiful hotel, great food and really comfortable rooms","I stayed at the Hotel Sofia with work and I was impressed with the rooms. The bed was hugely comfortable and had all of the essential amenities. The restaurant on the 19th floor was great, with a wide selection of food, and the bar downstairs was comfortable and relaxing. Really couldn't fault my stay.",5,2020,02,02

21,Fantastic short stay,Great service from all the staff I interacted with and the food in the Impar Restaurant was fantastic.  My room was well set out and I loved the automatic lights in the middle of the night.  I was only in Barcelona for 3 days and felt very safe and comfortable.,5,2020,01,30
21,very pleased,"This was my first stay at the Sofia, I was very impressed with the attendance, from the reception, the concierge, my niece cut her foot and needed a bandaid, they brought a full first aid kit. That is being prepared. Excellent overall.  ",5,2020,01,30

the Meeting rooms are equipped very well and are very convenient.",4,2020,01,28
21,Gem in the heart of Barcelona,"If you are looking for royal pampering that's where you need to stay. Impeccable services, high quality, attention to detail. A large selection of fine food for breakfast. High quality amenities. Great location. ",5,2020,01,27
21,Excellent,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Barcelona. The staff are always helpful and attentive. I have stayed in many different chains of hotels around the world and on would truly say on this occasion we have been left overwhelmed with the level of service we received throughout our stay. We have already recommend to family and friends to stay in this hotel and will be looking for a Hyatt group hotel for future vacations, based on this experience. This is what I would truly conclude as having received an outstanding service and experience from the start until we left. ",5,2020,01,26
21,Massive Shower,"Stayed here during storm Gloria, the howling winds whistled through the conference rooms but that didn’t matter as the hotel was very comfy. Great facilities, gym, spa, meeting room and even a book room. Lots of comfy chairs around the hotel and places to sit have a cuppa and a chat, lovely bar with lots of seating. Rooms are very nice, massive bathrooms, very nice beds and linen with a good minibar selection, who doesn’t want marshmallows!! The restaurant was great for breakfast although dinner wasn’t that good, room service seemed to be better. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2020,01,26
21,Barca,a fantastic good hotel with very good rooms and service.  I can really recommend this hotel.  it's 5 minutes walk to the football stadium!  very good breakfast and on match day it is an absolutely fantastic buffet not to be missed,5,2020,01,25
21,Lovely Hotel,"Hi, we recently visited the Sofia and really enjoyed the property.  It's very convenient to the airport, about 15-20 minutes away so that's nice.  To be honest, I was a bit worried when we arrived that it was a bit far from the ""sites"", etc...but I was wrong.  There's a metro (subway) entrance about a two minute walk from the hotel and you can get to the Gothic Quarter and other higher foot traffic areas within 20-30 minutes.  The metro is very easy to take and very well organized.  The rooms were quite spacious and the staff went out of their way to make sure that our stay was conformable.  I want to give a special commendation to the evening concierge, Christian.  He went out of his way to help book us a tour and also helped arranged it so a guaranteed taxi would he waiting for us at 4:30am since we had a very early flight out that morning, his service was exemplary. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,22
21,Loved it,"Enjoyed my stay in the hotel was near to the camp nou which was my reason for the visit and near it some restaurants and Starbuck and distance walk for some malls 
 great location and helpful staff and welcoming from the first day until our checkout ",5,2020,01,22
21,Hotel Sofia,We stayed two nights at this hotel and we enjoyed every minutes.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. The room are modern and very comfortable. The location are close to shopping centers and restaurants. If you planning a visit to Barcelona I recommend SOFIA hotel.,5,2020,01,13
21,Bachelor Party,"Last August, me and a group of friends went to Barcelona for a Bachelor party weekend, we ended up staying at SOFIA, and it was the best decision we made, apart from the hotel being absolutely beautiful, very stylish and designed, everything had quality, the beds, the bathrooms, everything in the room was perfect and very comfortable, but what really transformed our trip was the staff, we were extremely well received, and the concierge, Christian, definitely deserves a raise, he booked everything for us, gave us tips on where to go, restaurants, clubs, places to visit, I had his personal number and Christian’s service to us was just unbelievable, that simple thing turned our trip to Barcelona amazing. 
When I go back to Barcelona I won’t even think of staying in a different place, SOFIA is the best choice for me, by far. ",5,2020,01,03
21,Most comfortable hotel with the best staff that I have ever encountered,"This hotel is the most welcoming and comfortable hotel anywhere.   The staff is just incredibly warm and welcoming and really really makes you feel at home.  The rooms are plush and comfortable and fully loaded with amenities.  I had a wonderful stay at this hotel and was sorry to leave, even after four days.   Could not recommend it more.  ",5,2020,01,02

A special thanks to Carlos, Mathieu, Sofia,Marie Clair, Mamadou, Jorge...From the welcom desk. Emilio and the breafast team for there very nice morning services. 
Sara, Ernesto and all the bartenders and waiters for their kindness and their sense of welcome.
The only negative point is on the room : the light, specialy on the desk, a little lack of storage and drawers too and not having wifi on the pool terrace.
",5,2019,12,18
21,Great experience,"We have a great stay and experience at Hotel Sofia during our trip to Barcelona.
Very attentive and helpful staff at the hotel. Good location and very functional and comfortable rooms.
I want to especially point out Christian Brasero who was very helpful all through our stay.
",5,2019,12,07
21,Great hotel,"Excellent hotel, beautiful interior, good food and super friendly staff. Cannot wait to go there back again and try the spa and relaxation :) also location is very near to the football stadium which is worth visiting. ",5,2019,12,06

21,Hotel Sofia Barcelona - home away from home,"Our first visit to Barcelona. 

When we arrived after 13 hours on the plane, we were a little tired yet excited about our trip.

It was a 20 minutes taxi ride to Hotel Sofia Barcelona. Although we have done some readings before booking this hotel, it was a breath of fresh air when we reached there. The hotel is new, clean and sleek. The hotel staff helped us immediately with our luggages and the check-in was a breeze.

We were given a room on the 9th floor. It was a well sized room, clean, modern furnishings with user friendly lighting and drape switches located on both sides of the bed. The overall room design is not just modern but warm and practical. There are motion sensor lights located beneath the bed. The king size bed is comfortable and the wardrobe is spacious.

In our room the toilet is located separately from the bathroom. Normally these are the ones with small issues due to wear and tear, however everything looks incredibly new and clean.

The next morning we went to the Information Desk and met Christian Brasero who gave us some good ideas on visiting the city and suggested some popular restaurants. 

We asked Christian Brasero if the hotel is new and were surprised that it was built in 1978. About four years ago the hotel was closed for an entire year for a total revamp renovation. 

After the renovation the hotel has since been in operation for three years already. Thumbs up to the Housekeeping team for doing such a great job in maintaining the cleanliness and orderliness in the rooms.

Christian Brasero was very helpful throughout our stay, our appreciation for his help.

Yesterday was our last day in Barcelona and we enjoyed everything there especially our “home” at the Hotel Sofia Barcelona for eight nights. 

The staff working at the hotel, those that we met, are helpful, friendly and generous with their smiles. They are great goodwill ambassadors for Hotel Sofia Barcelona as well as for the city.

Barcelona is an amazing smart city with an interesting past. If you are also first time visiting Barcelona and wish to stay a little further away from the center, Hotel Sofia Barcelona is a very good option. 

Below are a few points if you are interested with more information.

(1) Public Transportation: Hotel Sofia is easily accessible by taxis, trams, buses and Metro/Subway. We used the Metro throughout our stay and found it convenient, frequent and fast .
(2) Metro: It took us 7 minutes to walk to the Metro Station Maria Cristina from the hotel. The Metro runs on Line 3, which will bring the commuter to most of the places of interest. Depending on where you want to visit, it’s a matter of a few stops. When we alight at Metro Station Catalunya, it’s around 10 stops and 15 minutes. I think the latest hours we took the Metro was around 8pm and it was ok.
(3) Metro commuters: Similar to those in other European countries. 
(4) Metro safety: Tourists are generally easy targets for pickpockets whether in Barcelona or in other countries, so please take precautions. It was out of kindness that we were reminded to be careful with our personal belongings by the hotel staff, the tour guides and the Metro station staff when we bought our tickets. We appreciated their advice and took extra care.
(5) Shopping around the hotel: Just a 3 minutes walk from the Metro Station Maria Cristina you will find El Corte Ingles, a large shopping mall to explore.
(6) Interesting places near the hotel: Camp Nou, the home stadium of FC BARCELONA is just a 10 minutes walk from the Hotel Sofia Barcelona.",5,2019,12,06
21,Super place,"My first time in the Sofia - I usually stay at the Fairmont when working at the Palau Congresos. It was a very pleasant surprise!

Staff are efficient and welcoming

The room was lovely with a huge walk in shower and energy saving sensor lighting

Breakfast was a generous buffet and the bar had a nice vibe

I will likely still choose more cave trap for a leisure trip - but this was a great business hotel 

",5,2019,12,04
21,"Old hotel, fantastic renovation","We stayed at the Sofia last week and were very impressed by two things - the extremely friendly, helpful and youthful staff and the way this older hotel was renovated that makes it feel new, modern and cool. The rooms are spacious and fitted with really comfortable beds/matresses. The bathrooms are luxurious and ours had a separate walk-in shower and a large Duravit free-standing bathtub - very nice for a relaxing soak after walking a day. We only had breakfast and no there meals in the hotel, and the selection of foods and beverages is very good. Cooked foods, bakery items, fruits, juices, etc etc. The hotel is located next to a subway station and getting around town is easy. The drive to/from the airport is only 15-20 mins. Highly recommended hotel",5,2019,12,02
21,Nice hotel,Stayed at this hotel as I was in town on business and it was conveniently located. Very friendly and helpful staff. My room was spacious and comfortable. I was not impressed with housekeeping - I rang for some toiletries and they never arrived. Not great. Otherwise the breakfast was good as was the stay overall.,4,2019,11,24
21,Amazing 3 night stay,"Great stay for an event I was looking after. Nice bar, good bed, decent sized room and great stacked bar! 

Lifts were an issue if I am being honest, but this is the only thing I can fault.

Will come back.",5,2019,11,18
21,"High on style, but some of the basics could do with some work","This hotel’s marketing wants you to appreciate just how stylish it is, and it is. The rooms are a decent size and well designed, with a nice Nespresso coffee machine (not refilled in my 2 night stay), and good quality toiletries. It’s when you step out of the room that trouble starts- first, the lifts. I was at a conference, and so there were surges in demand in the lifts, but several times the clever predictive mechanism whereby you select where you wish to go and your lift is chosen for you just gave up, and you were stranded for several minutes. I was at a conference and the food for that was very acceptable, the food in one of the restaurants (there are a number) the night before rather less so, with distinctly off jamon in the croquetas and jamon e huevos. So two cheers.",3,2019,11,17
21,Excellent hotel!,"I stayed here for the World Orphan Drug Congress in 2019. After 12 hours of travel, I was exhausted and so grateful to the front desk for granting me an early check in. Roon are exceedingly modern and well kept. I would very gladly stay here again and hope to plan another trip to Barcelona soon!",5,2019,11,16
21,"Hotel SOFIA - a gem perfectly situated away from the hustle and bustle, but a mere 2 stop metro ride from it all!","First off, the young woman who checked us in was terrific.  She was so delightful and helpful.  and each day as we returned to the hotel she made a point of welcoming us back and asking what we did that day and how our experiences were.  She really made us feel welcome and almost like we were returning “home” each evening.

Next, the concierge team was  very helpful in not only helping us find our way around (love the metro!) but also giving us wonderful tips about things to see and do while we were exploring Barcelona.  They made wonderful dinner reservations for us, and each place that he referred us to the restaurant host/ess greeted us and welcomed us referencing that Hotel SOFIA had called.  We were treated like VIPs!",5,2019,11,16
21,Rooms are not user friendly,"I disliked almost everything about the room. Hard mattress, Oversized sinks with very little counter space. Clear glass showers open to the whole room (not great if you are just sharing with a traveling friend). Lights that can not be controlled individually.",2,2019,11,12
21,"Unique room, shower, and bar","We enjoyed the beautiful room, a bit minimalistic but yet decorative with beautiful wood panel wall and ceiling. The walk in shower can be accessed from both sides and it's a party shower. Two different shower heads, quite fancy. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved the hotel's restaurant and its smaller cafe. If you are a book lover, please check out the cafe. To me, It's like a library in my dream. Great food and latte. The only thing is the hotel isn't in downtown. But it's within walking distance to a large retail store, multiple restaurants, bars, and cafe. If you are a soccer fan, it's very close to a training ground of a famous soccer club. I also recommend the hotel bar. The decor is impressive and the gentleman/bartender provided outstanding service. We had a nice stay.",5,2019,11,12
21,Fantastic hotel,"A great place to stay. The staff are really friendly and helpful. Immaculate hotel. An overall fantastic experience. Food was great too. I cannot fault anything about The Sofia at all, will definitely stay again.",5,2019,11,09
21,Great Place to Stay,It was a very clean and comfortable place to stay. All staff were courteous and very helpful. The rooms were very large. It was a no use to have the beds turned down every night and a small piece of chocolate waiting. It is located within walking distance to the metro.  ,5,2019,11,09
21,Great experience,"Our experience from check in to check out was perfect. The hotel is fantastic.  The staff is courteous and responsive. Our room was immaculate.  The concierge went out of his way to assist us with all our questions and made great dinner recommendations. This is the only hotel I will stay at while in Barcelona.  Close to trams, busses, and the metro.  5 stars.",5,2019,11,08
21,Excellent Experience,"We had a great time staying at Sofia Barcelona. As a World of Hyatt member, we were greeted with warmness and offered early checked in due to our early arrival. Bedroom is amazing, clean and comfortable. Staff and super friendly especially Laura and Sophia. We also love the coffee and croissants from the cafe downstairs. Will come back to here if we visit Barcelona again!",5,2019,11,06
21,Great stay in Barcelona,"The hotel is well located with easy access to the airport, underground or other public transport. Hotel staff are very professional, friendly and will attend to your every need. They offered good advise as to where to go and what to see and do. Plus we got a complimentary visit to the spa. Rooms are great, comfortable and well appointed. The hotel restaurants are great with very good menus without having to spend a fortune or there are a large variety of restaurants to choose from within easy walking distance should you want something local. The Hop-on, Hop-off bus can be picked up minutes away.",5,2019,11,05
21,Fabulous!,"My Husband and I stayed for 5nights to celebrate our honeymoon. Upon arrival we were kindly treated to a double room upgrade which was super lovely. The service we received throughout our stay made us feel super special. We were welcomed by staff in all parts of the hotel. The fine dining was exceptional. It was a bit chilly in the restaurant so they allowed us to dine in the lounge which was very very comfy and we still received the same special service. The spa is a dream, you have such a pretty view of the outside and all the trees. I recommend visiting this at night. It was romantic, the decor is superb and we managed to take some amazing pictures. Although you have to pay €45per person after your first visit, it doesn't seem like a very bad idea, considering it was quiet enough to enjoy. On our last night we ordered a mocktail and fries and were treated with double and at no cost! I am not shy of letting people know when I am unsatisfied and as this was our honeymoon, we did not want to leave and made full use of the hotel and its facilities. I cannot fault it and we look forward to returning. I highly recommend this hotel and very grateful. Thank you!",5,2019,11,05
21,Perfect place to stay,"My wife and I had a wonderful time at the hotel. Staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. We stayed on the 14th floor. Our room was spacious and clean. I enjoyed working out at the gym. We didn’t use any of restaurants at the hotel but they look very nice and welcoming. Hotel is located just five minutes waking distance from the metro station, coffee shop, high end shopping mall and a tram station. We high recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,11,02
21,Great hotel,"Room is very nice and clean. the  bed is very comfortable. Staff are awesome. So nice and they greet everyone they meet. The spa is good too and the lady who helps cleaning the area works so hard that she never stops. I felt so welcomed here. I would recommend  everyone.
The location is not around the old town but I love it since its quiet and less tourist.",5,2019,11,02
21,Never want to leave,"Truly an extraordinary hotel - impeccable service, staff can't do enough for you.  Pure quality with all the right touches.   This stay I used the hotel spa for a massage which was amazing from service to ambience.  I was super impressed how staff remembered my name every where I went in hotel, including some who remembered me from a stay 8 months earlier!  A special call out to Blanka who is ever so genuine in the club lounge!  ",5,2019,11,01
21,Underwhelming experience,"I stayed here for a conference so may have had a slightly different experience to some. It's close to the Nou Camp, but nowhere else. There's a metro station just down the road but if I was on a holiday break I'd want to be in the thick of things.  Compared to the image on the website it's an underwhelming building on a busy road junction. The rooms (I had a basic level room nearer the ground floor) were OK but have the bathroom essentially in the main room space which I don't like. Aircon was difficult to get right.
Getting to your room is a pain because despite the sophisticated system, there are long waits for the lift - presumably especially when events are on. The gym was OK but packed in the morning and needs more kit. 
I tried to eat in the library cafe but had to give up because of long waits - fortunately there are other cafes close by. Breakfast was fine.
Overall, it was an underwhelming experience, especially for the high room rate. There will be many better places closer to the centre!",3,2019,10,31
21,What a fab hotel,"Staying here for 10 days and it's one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. The room is so comfy, the lighting really special and everything thought through. ALL staff acknowledge, smile and greet guests beautifully. Terrific experience",5,2019,10,30
21,Excellent quality and service,"Hotel provide upscale service and plenty of amenities. Located just a block away from the FC Barcelona stadium and a short walk distance from malls and restaurants. I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel property and their restaurant offer many dishes to satisfy all tastes. Would consider this hotel again on future trip to Barcelona, Spain",5,2019,10,28
21,Unbound elegance,"A sleek, brilliantly designed hotel, with elegant public spaces.  Our junior suite was at once sleek and relaxing.  The neighborhood is at some remove from most of the tourist attractions, but those are not difficult to reach, and it was pleasant not to be part of the madding crowds.  A fine, book-lined cafe served delicious snacks.  Altogether a winner.",5,2019,10,27
21,Overnight stay,"This was a great stay.  We got there, and the staff made us feel very welcome as soon we stepped out of the cab.  The elevator is very different, in that you need to use your key card on a machine on the outside, and once it recognizes you, then you say what floor you want.  After that, it then tells you what elevator bank you need to go to get to your floor.  The room was good for what we needed.  We did ask for a 1 pm check out  instead of noon so that we could go to lunch and come back for our bags.  However, when we tried to get back into our room at 11:58 am, we were locked out.  We had to go downstairs to the lobby to get our key cards to work so that we could retrieve our bags from the room.  Overall it was a great visit, and it is a great addition to the Hyatt family.  We would come here again.",5,2019,10,25
21,Overnight stay,"I had the pleasure of spending a night at this wonderful hotel as I was on a training course with Nissan Motors.
The room was beautiful! Lovely comfy bed and wonderful food and breakfast.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,10,25
21,The excellence of service,"I had a great experience at the hotel first it’s very nicely designed 
Furthermore I had an issue with the AC immediately a technician had arrived and fixed it the great fact is the phone call after 10 minutes by the front desk verifying that I’m satisfied and all is well 
That’s a great example of excellence in service
The rest of the staff is very professional and polite 
The restaurants are very good and service as well is excellent 
I definitely recommande this hotel",5,2019,10,23
21,Wonderful Hotel!,"I have stayed 2 nights for a conference attendance within the hotel. The room is spacious, the staff is very kind and speaks well english, wifi is one of the best I have ever seen, sleep quality is wonderful with no noise in the room, very modern AC system with no noise and has a great room service. On business side the meeting rooms and organization was good as well. The only down side would be the diversity of the meals served on breaks or meals but this is not major cause the quality of what was served was very good. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. Overall I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,23
21,Great hotel with a convenient location to tour bus services,"My husband and I flew into Barcelona a day ahead of our scheduled cruise to view the sites and our Travel Agent recommended Hotel Sofia during our stay. After nine hours of flying from the U.S., we were greeted by a warm and friendly staff who were so helpful in giving us instructions on the great technology in the room and providing us with directions to the major site attractions in the city along with coupons. A special thanks to Laura at the front desk and to Sofia who personally toured the room with us and provided us with such helpful information. Dinner was exceptional and such a wide variety of quality foods available in the breakfast buffet. I will definitely recommend Hotel Sofia to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona!",5,2019,10,22
21,Fancy hotel in a poor location,"The hotel is in great condition except for an elevator system that didn’t work. Good location if you are going to watch football at Camp Nou, otherwise not. The room was great and so was breakfast and WiFi. Decent gym as well.",3,2019,10,17
21,Superb Place,"I travel a lot and this has to be on my list of top 3 hotels that i've ever stayed at. Everyone here is outstanding from the girls at the restaurant to the people that work at the spa to of course who ever helps you check in or out makes it easy for you. Special thanks to Isaac one of the guys that works at the lobby, not only he is very friendly and welcoming but also extremely helpful when giving you a tour of the hotel and great tips about what to do to in the city during the day or night time. 

The only one thing I did notice a few times I pressed to button of "" do not be disturbed"" and the cleaning ladies did come in , I guess its better to put the sign ""manually"" on the door knob than to press button next to the light because when I did put the sign they didn't come in. Other than that everything was perfect!

I would consider coming back again and also recommend this place to my friends",5,2019,10,09
21,Not what I expected,"Technology took aver the experience in elevators and lighting, making both cumbersome to use at times. Overall room was dark in color and without sufficient daylight. Room size for what was called an upgrade because of my Hyatt status was still small compared to what was expected.",3,2019,10,08
21,Amazing Hotel,"You can not go wrong with this hotel. 1) Comfy beds 2) perfect location close to green metro line 3) awesome staff 4) super clean 5) SPA WAS AMAZING. only drawback is that you only get one free visit to the Spa, other times it costs money. But that's ok! YOU ARE IN BARCELONA. ",5,2019,10,08
21,"Beautiful place,","This is a beautiful hotel and the staff was attentive. Had a weird experience at the restaurant. Order was screwed up, some inflated charges, which was disappointing. The room was amazing, the technology Was impressive.  The TV didn’t work in the evening, but it did the next morning. But, we were in Barcelona, so what?  The staff was attentive and professional. ",4,2019,10,07
21,Sofia makes a difference!,"We returned to Sofia Hotel and didn't regret. The hotel's staff is exceptionally friendly and pays a lot of attention to details! Reception and Conciergerie is super!
If one needs to give a ""minus"" it was the service at the breakfast, when it was hard to get a third round of beverages ordered... ",5,2019,10,07
21,Nice Environment,Clean and Quiet Environment! Great place to stay for business and or pleasure. Short Taxi ride to the downtown and airport with Great bar and friendly staff.  Breakfast provided by hotel is as good as what you expect in a European country but not as variety as staying in Asia!,4,2019,10,07
21,Sofia Hotel,"Excellent business hotel, great customer service - very modern and cool! Stayed here for 2 weeks at the start of September , very impressed by the quality of the hotel and how attentive the staff were...nothing was too much to ask.              ",5,2019,10,07
21,"The good, the bad and the ugly!","I recently stayed at the Sofia hotel during the ESMO conference in Barcelona.  I will start will the good points of the hotel.  Beautiful rooms, comfy beds and amazing pillows.  The housekeeping staff and front desk were awesome!  Super efficient willing to help with whatever i needed.  My room was cleaned every evening bed turned down nicely.  The very bad side of my experience is I never stayed at a  start hotel that served such terrible food and bad service in food and beverage spots.  You get seated outside to order a glass of wine and no one ever comes over to take your order.  It's strange they see you but never come over.  

The bartender was the most unfriendly, poor drink maker not sure he understood certain drinks it is clear he has no real training.  Went to the bar with a colleague and we sat and sat and sat as he wiped down the empty bar just ignoring us.  There was a female with his look to be a manager she too ignored us sitting there.  I finally had to say ""are you open""?  Then the very unfriendly bar keep came over.  He was awful never checked back to see if we wanted a second so we ask for check and left.  The night prior my entire team was at the bar for last call, a waitress pushed by my friends with her tray of empty glasses and dropped them and they broke all over the floor.  Not only did she keep on walking and never apologize she never picked it up.  So we all stood around pushing the broken glass under the bar stool so no one would step on it.  Again who does this at a 5 star hotel.  I will never ever stay there again!  Too bad they had nice front desk staff the door men were great too but if you can get decent food or a drink no point staying there.    My advice, hire a new chef and new wait staff.",2,2019,10,07
21,Very nice hotel with slow service and food is not great,"I stayed at Sofia for 5 nights on business. I am for sure not a picky person at all but the food was really not good. I ordered something off their in-room dining menu on the first night and was coughing it was so dry (and that's a first). The bartenders were outright mean to the patrons, ignoring them as well as just plain rudeness. The hotel was super clean, the front desk and cleaners were so kind. The experience overall was great I just HIGHLY recommend not eating or having a relaxing beverage there. Walk right across the street and sit outside, they are very kind and quick over there.",5,2019,10,07
21,so relaxing ,"my husband and i stayed for 3 nights at hotel sofia in barcelona, and we LOVED it. the rooms were so comfortable and modern. the gym was awesome (my favorite spinning bikes) there is a beautiful pool area, and the lobby was fantastic. off the lobby is a cafe with indoor/outdoor seating ( and full bar). there was an indoor cocktail lounge which made our cocktails precisely as we liked them (not easy in spain). the restaurant is also very nice although we didn’t eat there, just drank. the hotel is located next to the football stadium, and not far at all from touristic buses. nice walk or taxi ride to other sights.  oh, and i have to mention the staff- EXCELLENT- they were so helpful with everything from hailing a cab to answering our sightseeing questions. there was also a spa, but we didn’t have time to use it- maybe next time",5,2019,10,07
21,Great staff and wonderful accomodations,"Just returned from a stay at Hotel Sofia for a one week business trip.  The hotel was lovely and the staff aims to please.  A particular shout out to George, the bellman!  He was outstanding and looked out for me during my week at the Sofia.  The beds were so comfortable and along with the pillow menu, helped to provide me with a decent night's seep. I highly recommend the Hotel Sofia.",5,2019,10,02
21,A week in the sun with friends,"Princess SOFIA Hotel, Barcelona, Spain

15 September ~ 22 September 

My husbands employers had a week long conference based in the SOFIA hotel. Some of the employees took their wives along for a holiday, including me. 

Neither of us had been to Barcelona before therefore knew nothing of the transport or where to go during the day whilst our husbands were busy. So, we, en masse sought out Christian Brasero, the hotels’ City Host and Concierge.

His knowledge of Barcelona and the limitless information he has about the sights and how to get there effortlessly made our touring so much easier.

He gave us information on the Gaudi cathedral, La Sagrada Família, and the ticket prices. Sadly, they were sold out on the days we wished to go. 

He booked a restaurant for the group of 20, explained to the owner of allergies. Then did a follow up the next day to make sure everything went smoothly.

Christian went above and beyond what was expected of him. He is a valuable asset to the Sofia hotel.
",4,2019,10,02
21,Corporate conference ,"Stayed at the SOFIA as part of a company corporate event for four nights.
Pros:
Good location, not too far from airport and shops, restaurants and tram/ metro line in walking distance 
Hotel is very sleek, modern and stylish 
Conference facilities are excellent although all subterranean. After four days on -2 I felt hugely light deprived and caged in 
Food in the hotel was incredible 
Strong WiFi 
Brilliant gym/ pool 
Very reactive front desk. I had a problem with a power adaptor and within minutes of calling the front desk someone was here to help me 
Negatives: although on a high floor and what I thought was double glazing, I could still hear traffic noise
On the first day my room had not been made up by 17:00 which was a little annoying, esp as I left the room and deactivated the do not disturb sign at 07:30 am 

All in all a very solid hotel which was perfectly suited to our concerning needs! ",4,2019,10,01
21,"Home away from Home-Very comfortable, modern decor, best concierge service ever","Very comfortable and modern decor. They have made the best use of technology to make the stay comfortable. High tech gadgets available to use in the room- everything is electronic/ automatic- including night light turn on when moving as it has sensors, so you don't disturb your partner with the light. Breakfast is included and one of the best with lots of choices.
I had to use the concierge service for printing some documents and scanning them- Christian Brasero was so helpful and curteous in promptly printing them for me and then waiting to scan them back to me. I may not have been able to do it so promptly at home.Thank you Christian for making my work easy and helping me! I appreiciate your help.
This hotel is so close to local restaurants, starbucks, metro station and the mall which also has a supermarket. We used the metro pass to move around the city and did not feel the need to rent a car or take a taxi!!!",5,2019,09,29
21,Nice place to stay,Lovely hotel with great service. Has a business/executive feel to it. Delicious food and very clean and the staff are very helpful with any request. It’s not exactly in the main centre but has good metro lines and access to the main areas.,4,2019,09,28
21,Hotel Sofia,"Excellent service in a very modern, upscale hotel.  Restaurants, shopping, all within walking distance.  Public transportation is also readily available for those who want to travel throughout the city. ",5,2019,09,26
21,"Excellent Hotel, very well appointed and rooms lovely.","Stayed here last week at a work event and was very impressed as whole hotel very slick and well maintained.  Not cheap, but as I always say, you pay for what you get. Close to center of town, so taxi's not expensive for trips to Las Ramblas and Marina bars and restaurants. Outdoor pool is beautiful, as had drinks reception round it, but didn't get a chance to swim in it as had limited time, same for Spa.
Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2019,09,25
21,Delightfully Comfortable,"Great professional and friendly staff.  Good security and technology (loved the key card for elevator access) for comfort.  Enjoyed our stay.  Felt that the breakfast was expensive, but it was complete and convenient. While the room is expensive, it is worth it and certainly better than the competition at this service level.",5,2019,09,24
21,Spectacular and Sophisticated Hotel!!!,"I don't think I have ever written a TripAdvisor review, yet always count on TripAdvisor for international travel. I feel compelled to write one here. 

Hotel Sofia Barcelona was spectacular. We were originally booked at NOBU Barcelona and received an email few days before arrival stating NOBU was delaying their grand opening and wouldn't be able to accommodate us. NOBU suggested Hotel Sofia, and I have to say I am so grateful this happened. 

From the moment we pulled up to the hotel, to the lobby, the pool, the coffee, breakfast, spa, gardens, and finally, the best part-the gorgeous rooms-we were incredibly impressed. Barcelona is amazing, but I have to say staying at Hotel Sofia may have been the best part of the trip. So much so that one day we spent the entire morning and afternoon relaxing at the hotel spa and my dad said this was his favorite part of the trip. I cannot stop telling people how much I loved this hotel. 

Definitely will go back again and again.

The small details do not go unnoticed at this hotel-from the pillow menu to the sugar packets to the notebooks-this may have been the best hotel I've ever stayed in.",5,2019,09,22
21,"Superior hotel with first-rate staff, great security features, close proximity to metro","What a fantastic hotel, so glad we stayed here.  As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the doorman and our luggage was delivered to our room - before we even got there.  Matteo (sorry if I've misspelled)  at the front desk was pleasant and helpful, thanks to him, we knew the T10 metro ticket was just what we needed.  We stayed in an Infinity room on the 10th floor, lovely view and the room has all sorts of state of the art features, automatic window shades, ambient lighting, motion-based night lights, good temperature control. The center of the room is a little dark as it's mainly the perimeter that is lighted. The bathroom has a motion-based night light and the shower offers a rain-head and hand held options.  In terms of security, getting to your room involved scanning the room key at the elevator, you are then provided with destination options, such as 10th floor, assigned an elevator, 'B', and taken directly to your floor.  The only thing I could not figure our was how to use the plug the sink in the bathroom - no matter what I did the sink would drain - but had I been more available someone would have been happy to help me.  The hotel is in a nice location, only about a 5 minute walk to Marie Cristina metro - and that's all you need really.   I hope to come back to this hotel soon!!  Well done Hyatt Sofia!!",5,2019,09,19
21,Beautiful hotel with great warmth and service,"Great luxury hotel with modern and sizable rooms.  Very comfortable, and convenient too. There are many cafes, amenities around, and a short walk to subways and shopping, right next to Camp Nou.
Had a lovely stay, and the concierge service was superb!",5,2019,09,18
21,Fantastic hotel,"The staff are warm and friendly and very helpful. The room was beautiful and very restful. We loved the power blind and blackout shade and the layout was really neat. The shower is fabulous, I don’t normally like a rain shower but that one was divine! ",5,2019,09,18
21,Beautiful hotel,This hotel is beautiful and newly renovated. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The only reason for not being an excellent review is the location. The area is very nice but not close to most restaurants and shopping which are mostly downtown. It wasn't hard to get a cab but for the price of the room would have rather not had to pay for a cab to and from downtown. ,4,2019,09,17
21,Great service at an architecturally interesting property,The staff at this hotel are amazingly helpful. I experienced an unexpected acute back problem.  Staff went out of their way to make arrangements for our subsequent travel and followed up to see that everything had worked. The concierge a Christian was exceptionally helpful.  I have travelled extensively and had never had such exceptional assistance and service,5,2019,09,17
21,"Comfortable, sophisticated hotel","Slightly out of the way from convention area and downtown, but the neighborhood seems safe and hotel is a short distance from the metro stops.  Room was top notch-- comfortable, quiet, beautifully designed, great lighting, excellent climate control.  very clean.",5,2019,09,12
21,Wonderful experience at Hotel SOFIA Barcelona,"The staff at this hotel went out of their way to welcome us and make sure we had a pleasant stay.  The friendliness of everyone seemed genuine and warm. The hotel itself was modern and clean, with elegant streamlined decor.",5,2019,09,12
21,"Great service, modern technology, nice accommodations, would return and recommend ","We arrived at 0900, hours before check in, after an overnight international flight. Extremely sleep deprived, we arrived with the plan of dropping our luggage off, changing, and exploring the city until our room was ready. 
Though the room we booked was not ready, they were generous enough to upgrade us so we had a room immediately. They didn’t have to do that, so it was grateful appreciated!
This is a hotel that embraces technology. Want to use the elevator? ..swipe your card, the room you are staying on appears for your selection. Not sure where the light switch is in the middle of the night? ...sensors detect when you’re out do end and floor lights in the bathroom turn on. Want to open and close the blinds? ...there’s a button for that too!
Nice selection of equipment in the gym. Pool long enough for laps, though very narrow, so laps could be an issue if it’s crowded. 

Only down side is that the location was not ideal for us, so look at a map closely before booking. ",5,2019,09,08
21,Excellent high tech hotel ,"Attended a conference at the hotel and I must say that as a location it might not be ideal for a touristic visit, however everything is a short and affordable taxi ride away! 

The hotel is extremely modern with a few high tech elements to it! Love how the elevator has no buttons and how the rooms are managed via touch screens! Hotel is spotless and the rooms are spacious! There is also a very nice cafe/restaurant at the lobby with a lovely outdoor space! 

Finally the staff are very pleasant and welcoming. 

I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel ",5,2019,09,06
21,Comfortable luxury,"This hotel was wonderful, from the moment we walked in the door it was above and beyond our expectations. The bed/pillows were VERY comfortable! Convenient light controls near the bed and throughout the room (including a light in the bathroom working with a sensor which was nice for going in the middle of the night). All the staff were extremely helpful and kind. It’s very close to a metro station which made it easy to explore Barcelona and also easy to get to the airport early in the morning for our flight. It was a perfectly luxurious ending to our time in Spain. ",5,2019,09,05
21,Great hotel with great service ,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights for the trip to Barcelona and glad we chose this hotel. 

-  Room

The room is modern, clean, nicely designed and spacious.  I have stayed in multiple hotels but this is one of the best ones.  

-  Service

The service is top class, everyone was helpful and friendly.

-  Location

The hotel is not very near to attractions, but the bus stop in front of hotel is very convenient to get to city centre within 20-30 mins.  Just hop on and take a seat.  There is also a big shopping mall nearby with a supermarket, in case you need to do some last minute shopping.  If you are planning to catch a FCB Football game, this is the perfect location...walking distance. ",5,2019,09,03
21,"From Beginning To End, A Perfect Hotel","It's hard to know where to start with the Sofia. I arrived weary from a long flight and an average stay at another Hyatt hotel in Barcelona. I needed something better and decided to switch hotels. The minute my taxi pulled up to the Sofia, I knew I was home. The bellmen greeted me warmly and upon walking up to the front desk I was welcomed with a smile and was told that indeed there was room at the inn. Due to my membership with Hyatt, I was upgraded to a Junior Suite on the 16th floor with a sweeping view of Barcelona all of the way to the Carribbean. I couldn't have been happier. 

The room was perfect, from the fixtures and furniture, comfortable bed, rain shower...you name it, the Sofia has thought of it. And if you forget anything, they will quickly bring it to your room. The location -- as has been mentioned before -- is perfect for football fans; just a quick 5 minute walk to the Camp Nou as well as walking distance to a shopping mall that included restaurants and a grocery store. A longer walk takes you to the center of Barcelona and taxis are readily available with a taxi stand directly in front of the hotel.

The restaurants are impeccable with an outstanding breakfast and the Impar restaurant being nearly perfect on every level. There is a somallier on staff with a great command of the wine list, which I made good use of. Unfortunately, because August is vacation month and very slow, the Sofia BeSo and Zuu were closed, but I look forward to a return to discovering what I missed out on. Even the grill by the pool served a top-notch lunch.

But what really sets the Hotel Sofia apart are the people. From Alfredo at the front desk to Christian and Mathieu at the concierge desk to Saleh and the rest of the bell and doormen and so many other employees whose names escape me at the moment. I remember you. I appreciate your smiles and hospitality and for everything you did to make my stay absolutely perfect. The staff at the Sofia are the best!

There's no reason to keep looking. The Hotel Sofia is quite possibly the perfect hotel and easily my favorite hotel in Europe.",5,2019,09,03
21,Luxury,"All perfect
Super service - nice room - stunning hotel in a nice area out of turist zone buy still plenty of shopping and food oprtunities.
Good price/quality especially if you order in advance.
Will be back",5,2019,09,01
21,Barcelona Visit 2019,"Wonderful first class property with food and service to match, from in hotel prepared foods to suggested restaurants and points of interests to visit-- my new go to spot when visiting Barcelona! Prepared for warm weather days, luxurious well air conditioned rooms, with great views from the higher floors! Breakfast was amongst the best meals i had when visiting the region -- consider for personal travel and for business!",5,2019,09,01
21,Nice Place,"Good Hotel, Went during renovations so was quite loud after 12 but thats my fault for staying in too alte, there was only one small outside pool, which was quite disappointing as wanted a nice indoor pool to use.",4,2019,08,31
21,Best Hotel I’ve stayed in for a WHILE ,"Really couldn’t beat this hotel. From start to finish I felt like I was treated like royalty. The aesthetic of the ‘universe’ as they call it is beautiful and so tranquil. Bottles of water and chocolate were delivered to our room every evening which was just incredible and such a surprise. 

One free spa admission each for our stay. The spa is beautiful and made us so relaxed.

The staff couldn’t do enough for you. Albert especially was just amazing. Anything we needed he arranged and was such a lovely face to see every day in the hotel lobby! 
Christian was also a great concierge and provided us with all the information on Barcelona we needed! 

Our room was also upgraded and we were allowed to extend check out. (Check In early was also provided for us!) 

I couldn’t recommend it enough. The location is slightly out of the centre but I actually preferred this as it was easy enough to get into the centre but you had the more relaxed side of the city to come home to every night!

Wish I could give more than 5 stars! 

",5,2019,08,30
21,Excellent Modern Hotel,Very modern hotel with a nice quite location.  Short walk to the Metro to access central Barcelona.  The staff was very helpful in fixing a couple of issues with the room.  It seemed to be a very safe hotel with security taken seriously by them.  My first stay at this property.  I would look forward to another stay here on returning to Barcelona.,5,2019,08,29
21,Friendly & Quiet & Clean,Visited with my family ( 3 kids ) in August 2019. Good location. Very nice lobby area. Excellent coffee at PhiloSofia Coffee Place while books are watching you... very friendly staff.. 700 m walking distance to Camo Nou if yoi plan to watch Barcelona FC Game.. we loved it.. TV sound system was not perfect and rooms could have got bit more lighting in the evenings..,5,2019,08,29
21,"Chic, luxurious, awesome BCN hotel.","The design on this modern hotel is fantastic, from the lobby, to the elevator and rooms everything screams attention to detail. I loved my stay at Sofia. The hotel is located steps from the Camp Nou. You have a subway station that takes you directly to City center and a Hop on - Hop Off Gray Line stop steps from the hotel door. I stayed at a Jr Suite and the room was spacious, the bed dreamy and the bathroom spectacular. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. The gym is very well equipped and the pool while small it is great for a nice splash after a long day of walking.",5,2019,08,29

21,Excellent,"I really liked the hotel, all service personal are very pleasant. The first day we arrived we got macarons as gift from the hotel. The room was so clean, they cleaned the room more than one time at the day. We come every evening at the room and been surprised with free bottle of water and choclate pieces. Nothing could be better. It takes 10 minutes from the hotel to Catalunya with the Metro, the hotel is worth the time.  Its 7 minutes walk from camp nou.",5,2019,08,28
21,"Great new Hyatt brand hotel in Barcelona, great design !",Nice hotel and loved the design of this hotel. Rooms were beautiful and large. The location is not right in the center of the city but I can still walk to many nice restaurants in the area. It's about a 10 minute taxi ride into the city center.,5,2019,08,28
21,Best hotel I ever stayed at. ,"So please by our stay at Hotel Sofia. Amazing design in the room, very comfortable bed, great room service, friendly staff, tasty food (best burger we ever had), nice swimming pool... A great experience all around. Thank you.",5,2019,08,27
21,Great service at a modern hotel,"The hotel was completely refurbished and taken under Hyatt ownership a couple of years ago, and the rooms are now very sleek and modern with a great selection of amenities.  The service from the hotel staff is exemplary, and we particularly enjoyed spending some time around the outdoor pool, which is a beautiful area in which to relax and enjoy a drink from the pool bar.

The hotel has a number of restaurants - we enjoyed in-room dining, for which the food was to a very high standard.  

We highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again on future visits to Barcelona - particularly when attending a match at the Camp Nou as the hotel is just a short walk away.",5,2019,08,27
21,Fantastic Hotel,"Best hotel we have stayed in, staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was beautifully decorated and the rooms were immaculate, comfortable and modern. It was a pleasure hotel Sofia!! We will be back. ",5,2019,08,26
21,Really made to feel special!,"Had an excellent 10 day stay at the SOFIA Barcelona for our honeymoon. Service by Christian on the concierge desk was second to none and we were really made to feel special. I would stay here again as the hotel has excellent public transport links and removes the need for a private car, yet is out of all the hustle and bustle of Las Rambla or Catalunya Square.",5,2019,08,25
21,Modern and high end hotel with great services,"Wonderful hotel in barcelona. Rooms are spacious, modern and very clean. You receive all the things that you need to make your stay very comfortable. Pool is nice and location is not far from the center",5,2019,08,25

The personal is always around if you need anything with a smile , loved the location too far from the crowd and noise of the city and you have many restaurant around and commercial centres where you can find anything you want , we ordered also from room service and it was perfect, Christian is one of the concierge in the hotel and this guy is amazing ! kind , and friendly you can ask him anything you want and he will make your wishes come true a professional person who does his work in perfection , I did ask him many times about any recommendations about places to visit and restaurant and activities we could do together me and my daughter and he gave me the best , we both had a fantastic time never been disappointed at all , the hotel decoration is modern ... there is a lot to write about this hotel ..

21,Vacation,"It's a great hotel with great amenities, however, the location is far form the main touristic areas. 
if you want a more quiet and local neighborhood then this hotel will be perfect for you. Very clean rooms ",5,2019,08,22
21,Brilliant property and excellent staff,"Visited Barcelona in mid-July and stayed five nights at Hotel SOFIA. My wife & I were visiting on leisure and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the property. 

The hotel is very slick, modern and clean. Albert at check-in was very helpful in getting us a room on a high floor. The front office staff was always on hand to say hi and assist us with any questions whenever we arrived and left the hotel.

The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. The bathroom is very big and with a nice rain shower.

A special thank you to two concierge's, Mathieu & Christian, who I interacted with a lot during our stay. They were both extremely kind to assist with attraction bookings and restaurant reservations, and also gave us great recommendations on what to do in the city. I am a big football fan and had a wonderful chat with Mathieu about FC Barcelona and he recommended I visit the stadium for a tour, which is a 5-minute walk away from the hotel. Really great guys who care about their guests.

We had a late-night flight out of Barcelona back to Asia and the hotel staff were helpful in allowing us to use the shower facilities near the pool to freshen up before a long flight back home.

Thanks to all the staff at the hotel for allowing us to have a great time in your beautiful city. We have already recommended the hotel to our friends visiting Barcelona and will hopefully be back again in the near future.",5,2019,08,20
21,Hotel Sofia Barcelona,"This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in by far! Very clean, staff very approachable and helpful and just nice talk to. It is also very affordable for what one receives. Good work guys, and thank you, you have done an amazing job, my partner and I would definitely stay again :)",5,2019,08,19
21,Summer in the City,"This was only my second stay at a member of Hyatt’s Unbound Collection - and actually on the same trip.
The hotel is conveniently located between the airport and the city center.
I had reserved a Wish Suite which comes with 18th floor lounge access and check-in.
Upon arrival I was whisked up to the lounge and from there to my room in the floor below.
The room was furnished very modern, split into a fully stocked bar with premium wines and spirits and dining area, a living room, bedroom with walk-in closet and a bathroom.
The bathroom featured a large rain shower which I have only encountered in one other hotel, namely the Park Hyatt Shanghai. The toiletries were by Barcelona brand Natura Bissée, coincidentally the same featured as in Park Hyatt Shanghai.
The service was always prompt and friends.
Breakfast was conveniently offered until 11 AM daily and featured a wide selection of Spanish and Catalan specialties.
The main restaurant had an equally local menu.
The gym was equipped with the latest TechnoGym equipment and the outdoor pool was surrounded by tasteful deck furniture.
It was noticeable that my visit coincided with the peak summer vacation period as many shops and restaurants were closed with signs indicating that they would only reopen late in the month.
This made for a very relaxing stay without the hustle and bustle of an otherwise vivid city. Hotel Sofia provided for a good pint from which to explore the city.
I am looking forward to future visits of Barcelona and most likely will stay at Hotel Sofia again.",5,2019,08,18
21,Very Disappointing,"A very plush hotel, clean and very modern. 
We were very well received at the reception ...very professional and willing to help .. Thank you Zak for all your help with our reservation. 
We then went to the pool restaurant and what a disappointment !...A five star hotel with the prices to match ..ok that’s normal.. but when you ask for just a portion of bread to go with your very expensive tiny plat of tomatoes and you are blankly refused by the manager and the chef .. not cool .. and to top it all .. we go to pay the bill and they had added a bottle of rosé wine to our bill that we had NOT consumed !",1,2019,08,18
21,Fantastic Hotel. Flawless. Safe. Professional. Clean.,"We spent 4 nights here in August 2019 and had an AMAZING TIME. Everyone on staff was professional, timely and kind. Matteo and Maria at the front desk were very help. Christian at the concierge desk was knowledgeable and sent us to the PEFECT tapas restaurant. The pool could use a few more lounge chairs but the outside bar area is great. All of the bartenders and restaurant staff was great. Housekeeping was stellar. We were on the 1st floor and I was worried about noise but because the hotel is elevated, the 1st floor is actually like the 3rd floor and far from the street. It was super super quiet. Also, the elevator/key system makes the property feel VERY safe. Book this property, you WILL NOT regret it - that's coming from someone who has lived in NYC for 10 years! :)",5,2019,08,18
21,Fantastic Place to Stay!!,"From check-in to check-out, our stay couldn't have been any nicer. The hotel is immaculate and our room was modern and high-tech., We had a wonderful King-size bed that was comfortable and had a variety of pillows to choose from for sleeping as well as a variety of toiletries that were of an excellent quality. Our bed was also turned down nightly with delicious chocolates!!
We weren't in our room very much though. We planned to see and do a wide variety of activities and our Concierge Matthieu helped us navigate them all smoothly and with good advice for us on the best way to do them or actually booking our reservations for us. All of the Concierge's at the hotel were wonderful though including Luis, Christian, and Sofia!
However, when we were at the hotel we were usually hungry and thirsty. This is where the most memorable part of our stay was formed with the friendly staff at Impar and a shout out to Henar who truly became a friend, and Viviana, who encouraged us to go see the ""Magic Fountains"" show (It was fantastic!!). Rafael, at the pool bar gave us many places to go and see, while the bartenders in the back bar visited with us for nightcaps before bed.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we plan to go back again in the near future and revisit sunny Barcelona!!!",5,2019,08,16
21,Great Hotel,"Beautiful property, the rooms are very clean and the staff is extremely helpful. Christopher recommended a wonderful restaurant for us and we enjoyed laying out by the pool.

21,Excellent place to stay,Couldn't fault any of the staff or experience I had from our stay. Had a great time and felt welcome across the whole stay.

The hotel has 5 stars, however according to my experience and evaluation, it’s 7 stars worth it.
We enjoyed staying at this hotel very much and there was nothing that they could have done it better. The location was great, the personal was very friendly and helpful. The gym and the swimming pool were extremely clean.
Especially, Mr. Carlos was extremely helpful and assisted us in every manner possible. Jose and Adriana were also amazing and very competent. Mr. Luis was the perfect guide for us in regards to visiting the best sightseeing in Barcelona.
For this amazing experience was Mr. Raul resposible who is a very skilled Manager. Whenever I think of Barcelona, my memories automatically connect with this beautiful hotel and I recommend everyone to stay at this hotel and enjoy the same experience like I did.  
Looking forward to visiting Barcelona again and being accomodated in this hotel again.
 
Greeting from Austria!

21,Very modern and lovely,"Hotel is very cute. Everything is very modern and new, breakfast was nice and the bar is super cool! Only thing was that we had to wait a long time in the room until our luggage arrived. Otherwise good stay and can recommend. ",5,2019,08,02
21,Wow!,"Hotel Sofia was amazing, the service here was absolutely fabulous! 
It’s location is good, close to shopping centres and a short taxi ride to city centre.
Room we had was spacious, housekeeping amazing, front desk incl concierge incredible. 
Only suggestion for improvement would be to open pool area earlier and leave open later, this area is vital to guests, and its limited hours was rather surprising for a Hyatt. Even just leave it accessible if you don’t wish to staff it longer.
That aside, Highly recommend this very special home away from home.

Go say Hola to Sofia! She’s beautiful

21,Great Modern Stay with Amazing Staff,"Stayed for one night pre cruise.  Staff is welcoming and nice restaurant on site with great breakfast.  Not right in City Center but very close.  Rooms are nice size, modern and comfortable.  Slept great.",5,2019,07,29
21,Very Classy Hotel,"Our stay at Sofia was incredible. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very up to date in terms of technology, design, and comfort. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean as well. The cafe and restaurant have a great atmosphere and the food tastes great.

The location of the hotel is unfortunately far from the center, but it is worth it in terms of price vs quality. Also, there is a shopping mall and plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby as well.

Overall this is such a great hotel. Thank you for a great experience!",5,2019,07,28
21,"Very kind, helpful staff","I stayed here for four nights for business.  I had arrived more than 24 hours late due to a flight cancellation and my luggage was lost.  It was Saturday evening and I needed to be in meetings starting at 10 am Sunday morning.  After I checked in, I spoke to the staff member at the concierge desk and explained that I really needed some laundry done so that I could attend my morning meeting.  The staff member, coincidentally named Sofia, couldn't have been kinder and more helpful.  She said no problem, she would go up to my room with me, help me fill out the laundry slip, and call housekeeping from my room and have them come and get the laundry right away.  I had a clean shirt back in my room in a few hours.  She also had a bag of toiletries delivered to my room within ten minutes of my arrival.  During the rest of my stay she helped me with directions, restaurant recommendations, and anything else I needed.  Her colleagues staffing the front desk, the front door, and the restaurant were all equally helpful and welcoming.  The service I received from the whole staff was at the level one usually receives only at the most high end-hotels, such as the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. 

The hotel itself is very modern and looks like it was recently updated.  The restaurant was very good, with a lavish buffet breakfast.

Overall, this was a great hotel for a business trip and it seems very reasonably priced for everything it offers. ",5,2019,07,27
21,Business Partners' Meeting,"This hotel was great, and their staff was always very pleasant.  I stayed an entire week and did not have any problems.  The rooms are clean, state of the art showers and lighting systems.  High level of security. The food was delicious too.
All rooms are good as I went there for work I just wanted the blackouts to work, and be able to get a great rest prior to my busy workday in the meeting rooms of the hotel.  The audio and media staff were also very professional and always willing to help which is a plus.  Whenever  I'd return to my room in the evenings I always  found a small box with a tiny chocolate on my bed which was a nice touch.  The sheets and pillows were of top quality.",5,2019,07,26
21,I recommend this hotel,Staff are very friendly and helpful. Special Thanks to Ms. Sofia at the information desk. Hotel is modern and clean. Excellent service! I definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends. Thank you! ,5,2019,07,25
21,Excellent concierge staff!  Beautiful rooms - BEST sleep EVER! Spa - AMAZING!,"First off you need to reserve one day at the spa while you are here!  And you MUST make sure of the concierge staff. They helped lay our our entire 5 day visit and they were EXCELLENT at recommending everything from an evening stroll, to helping us get tickets to the chapel, and everything!  Can't say enough good things about that staff!  The Spa is superb and you will want to spend at least 2-3 hours relaxing after all the tours and walking you do around Barcelona.  Loved the beds and the blackout curtains at this hotel. We did also store our luggage with the bell staff and they did an excellent job. I didn't eat at the restaurant as we had reservations elsewhere so can't speak about the food.  We enjoyed our visit so much!  Thanks.",5,2019,07,24
21,High tech and lovely hotel,"Excelente service, location and amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful, high technology hotel, good for business meetings or family getaways. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona!",5,2019,07,24
21,SOFIA Barcelona = Great Rooms and Very Exclusive Wish Lounge,"I stayed at Hotel SOFIA in Barcelona now that it has joined the Hyatt group post renovations.  Hotel SOFIA is located in a nice neighborhood but not very close to tourist attractions.  It is 8 subway stops from the beginning of La Rambla on a direct subway line (L3), but for access to the beach area / Barceloneta then the subway transfers will not be convenient.  For tourists, SOFIA’s location is not ideal and it does not have any of the “wow” factor of W’s location; it is also an inferior location compared to Ritz Carlton or EDITION.  SOFIA is less than 1km from Camp Nou so it is great for people going to an event at the stadium, and I suspect SOFIA targets football teams coming to play in Barcelona or guests attending other events in the stadium.  SOFIA is even closer to the stadium than the Fairmont hotel.  

I was booked in a First Wish suite and found this room to have excellent hardware throughout, particularly the bathroom with high quality finishes.  The shower is large and has a dual rain shower and hand shower which can work at the same time.  The bathroom has Natura Bissé Barcelona products refilled generously daily, some of them in large bottles.  There is a large flat screen TV straight in front of the bed on a wall with soft color tiles.  All furniture is of good quality including leather chairs near the bed.  The only negative about renovations would be the carpet in the bedroom - they could have easily put floor tiles instead.  Most new and modern hotels have floor to ceiling windows but you can notice it’s an older hotel that was renovated because the two windows only cover part of the wall in the bedroom and bathroom; the windows themselves have been replaced and are brand new however.  The window in the bathroom provides good natural light in the entire bathroom, including in the shower because there is a tinted glass so the shower is not dark.  The toilet enclosure has the same tinted glass door – it is perhaps not as good a design as for the shower.  

The bar area of the room looks sharp and includes premium spirits and Riedel glasses.  Just to give an idea of the kind of guests they target in these suites, the mini-bar in the room has Dom Perignon 2009 and several top red wines such as Cos D’Estournel.  For millionaire footballers having a party, it would be awesome.   

Another feature which might betray this being an older property is that air conditioning was not working very well.  Even if we left the room with curtains closed during the day and AC at maximum strength, when we came back it was about 23C.  Also with AC at the max all night, the temperature was still not below 22C in the morning.  So I would not say the room was hot, but we would have preferred cooler than 22-23C particularly for sleep.  

Breakfast is free for Hyatt Globalists members in the restaurant with convenient hours 7-11am.  The quality of the food was very good and the choice of fruits was nice for example blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cherries on a daily rotation.  This being Barcelona the breakfast offerings were heavy on meat which I am not a fan of, but I recognize that others would be pleased with the choice.  There were several cold cuts and three kinds of sausages as well.  The cold buffet had smoked salmon which was very tasty, along with a few kinds of olives and giant capers.  Cereals were provided in individual small bags which might not be the most environmentally friendly thing to do but it’s more sanitary than when cereals are provided in the buffet to all guests in a big bowl.  There were also some gluten-free crackers and cakes individually wrapped as well with a sticker from a local pastry shop.  To cap it off they have free flow Cava available as well.  The layout of the restaurant is well thought out with lots of tables available so breakfast never felt crowded and there are also tables available to eat outside.  Similar to our room, the design of the restaurant is attractive and furniture of good quality.  Regarding service, unfortunately it was not as good as the food.  Once you arrive at the restaurant nobody brings you to a table, after you give your room number they just say “sit where you want”.  As a result nobody took our drink order and we had to ask near the bar area.  For refills it was the same thing, staff was not proactive so we had to ask, in addition staff forgot on a few occasions our requests and we had to either ask again or just let it go, rather than disturb them a second time.  I wish breakfast had been available in the lounge – service was infinitely better there.  

Some of the most exclusive lounges I have been to are Ritz Carlton and Fairmont lounges in large part because they are limited to paying guests – elite status does not get you access.  In Hotel SOFIA, similarly the Wish lounge is accessible only to guests booked in the Wish suites which means there are not a lot of people.  The lounge is open 24/7 with staff available at all times and when we stopped by it was unsurprisingly very quiet given the few Wish suites in the hotel.  Food is limited to some small snacks including fruits or desserts, and you can have soft drinks for free as well.  There is no happy hour with hors d’oeuvres and alcohol at the bar of the lounge is available for purchase.  The price difference between the First Wish suites and the Junior Suites is about 400 EUR which is roughly double the cost of Club access at Ritz Carlton, where you can have food and alcoholic drinks included with lounge access, as is the case in most regular lounges.  The price you have to pay for Wish suites is a bit puzzling: for that kind of money they should have more food on offer and free premium drinks available as well in my humble opinion.  Alternatively (or in addition) they should have an exclusive breakfast in the lounge with special a la carte options and avoid exposing guests to the subpar service downstairs, but unfortunately that is not the case.  As mentioned above since the hotel is so close to Camp Nou, given the pricing level of the Wish suites I can only wonder if this is because their target clientele are rich footballers who might not care if the lounge access costs twice as much as at Ritz Carlton, not to mention that Fairmont Barcelona does not have a lounge unlike many other Fairmonts in the world so a football team that wants 24/7 top service in a private lounge in proximity to the stadium might find that SOFIA is the best choice by far and they might be willing to pay good money for it, but tourists, not so much.  If we focus on the service provided by Wish staff however (rather than food & beverages), you cannot ask for anything better.  

In conclusion we had a nice stay at Hotel SOFIA and paid a considerably low rate; I am assuming business is quiet in July-August for this neighborhood, and other hotels in touristy areas I was considering such as RC, W, and EDITION were all more than double the price and SOFIA was hard to beat at that price.  However if I am going to Barcelona in a different month of the year in the future when there are more business travelers staying in SOFIA’s area, the price would be closer to Marriott chain competitors in tourist destinations and in that case I would not stay at SOFIA because the location is not that great for my purposes and the lounge is suitable for a different crowd than regular tourists.  I believe the lounge is a better fit for groups with lots of money to spend on a business conference or sporting event: you pay for lounge access, then you pay again in the lounge for premium spirits.  If I want to pay for a lounge, I will pay for the one at Ritz Carlton instead.",4,2019,07,23
21,Nice 5* hotel,"Hotel is stylish, staff is nice and kind. Not a huge pool, but really great atmosphere. Breakfast is crazy, so many different types of food. If you want a nice, modern, stylish hotel I can recommend Hotel Sofia Barcelona",5,2019,07,22
21,First choice when coming to Barcelona,"I stayed several times with more than ten nights in this property. Everything is perfect here. Well connected to everywhere you'd like to go in Barcelona, and new facility of the best quality. The design is also amazing in terms of both the feeling as a whole and in details. Restaurant and the spa facility are also what you can't miss. Also, every staff here is very warm and helpful",5,2019,07,21
21,Exceptional,"Stylish, clean, and modern. Very comfortable bed and extensive pillow selection and overall great amenities. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Just make sure you book a room away from the elevator because the soundproofing isn't great.  ",5,2019,07,19
21,A perfect stay,"This Hotel is amazing. Everybody here is so friendly and makes you feel very welcomed. Rooms are beautiful, moderm and spacious. Our room had a Nespresso Machine and a watercooker. I really fell in love with the bathroom. The shower is huge and everything is just perfect. We were in the Harmony Room. 

The pool is really clean and they serve great pool snacks. Staff helps you with everything you need, so just ask them, if you need something. 

There is a Metro Station and a shopping mall about 5 walking minutes away. From there it‘s about 15 minutes to Passeig de Gracia or the La Boqueria. The airport is about 15 Minutes away (30€ by taxi) ",5,2019,07,19
21,Modern hotel in a good location ,"The hotel was about 25 minutes from Barcelona Airport. The Closest metro station is Maria Cristina. Lot of public transport options are available. If Attending any Barcelona football game, then Camp Nou is in walking distance.
It is a modern luxury hotel with nice amenities. They are a very good option for hosting business meetings and conferences. The only observation is that the hallways are darker than usual. There were no lights in the shower area. It felt dark.
Wifi and meal options in the lobby restaurant was good.",4,2019,07,19
21,Hotel Sofía barcelona,"The hotel was amazing, thee room was above our expeditions, the staff was really nice and everything was clean, except it’s location it’s a bit far from the center takes 20min in metro. I would decently come back/ recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,19
21,Well-designed hotel with lovely staff and services,"The room was fantastic! Rainfall shower was heavenly, complementary shampoo/conditioner worked a treat, and the bed was the best sleep I could have asked for. The room also had blackout blinds, which is a huge plus for me. In general, the hotel is beautiful; the decor is very well designed (the lobby is basically an art installation), and the concierge were very polite, friendly and helpful.
As far as negatives go... We left the room to go for a meal, and came back to find chocolates on the pillow and some cava in an ice bucket with a personalised welcome note. Whilst the note was very thoughtful, the fact that a random bucket of ice-cold cava appeared in the room (which we assumed we had to pay for) made us really nervous about touching anything else in the room because we were afraid we'd have to pay for it, and we'd already spilled out to book the room for the evening. E.g. they charge €8 for a packet of gum, so there's no way I want to touch the chocolate that has been left on my bed! Apart from this awkwardness, the room was fantastic, and if we were having another special occasion in Barcelona, I wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2019,07,17
21,Excellent priced luxury option in Barcelona,"I was pleasantly surprised by the level and quality of the finishings, the avant-garde style and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff in this hotel. There is great value for money and everything is there, in the right place. I will definitely come back!",5,2019,07,17
21,Enchanting Sofia!!,"Great place in Barcelona !! Will stay here when I come back again. Service is great, the staff are attentive and the stay was truly delightful.  Very near to the train station and easy access to City Bus tours.",5,2019,07,15
21,One of the nicest hotels I have ever visited,"This was one of the nicest hotels I have ever visited, making my last few nights in Europe so relaxing. I got a really great deal, making it quite reasonable. My only complaints, are similar to most places. The internet connection was a little slow (not great for streaming), and there weren't vegan options in any of their restaurants. 
The rooms were amazing, and extremely comfortable, with any amenity you can think of (and some you probably wouldn't think of, like tiny lights under the side tables, that sense when you put your feet on the floor, and turn on). ",5,2019,07,14
21,Could not have wished for a better hotel,"I stayed in Barcelona for a few days in hotel Sofia and I could not have wished for a better hotel! The staff were so friendly and helpful, the food in the restaurant was outstanding (and a decent price), the bar was lovely, the pool was stunning! I visited the spa, for which the pool was shut which was sad, but they offered the suite at no extra expense which was incredible, the massage was wonderful and the staff were so kind. My hotel room was stunning, always clean and exactly what I was hoping for, I have not a bad word to say about this hotel, 5* all day every day!",5,2019,07,14
21,Great Hotel! ,"Loved the Sofia! Spent 3 nights at the hotel - beautiful room (Infinity on 15th floor), comfortable bed, great shower, unlimited coffee in the room (helped with jet lag), super friendly staff, excellent gym (cardio machines, dumbbells, mats, etc.), and awesome pool. It’s off the tourist circuit, so that’s something to consider when booking. I would definitely stay there again. 

Unfortunately, some guests were shouting in the hallway at 2-3 am 2 out of the 3 nights I was there. ",5,2019,07,13
21,Go for it,"Amazing facilities and staff, very confortable and modern with everything you need. Not on the midle of the action but well connected, even better than staying in the center on my opinion. Food and restaurant staff could improve, but overall an amazing stay!",5,2019,07,12
21,Rude Staff,"The hotel reception couldn’t give me printed bill as they ran out of paper; they promised to give me on email but they never sent and they speak rudely saying they will do it; god knows when. I am still awaiting to receive my bill on email. 
",2,2019,07,11
21,Sofia review,I loved this hotel. Overall great experience just a bit far from downtown and restaurant options. Customer service was also great. They helped me plan and pay for a tour of Guadi’s church. The room was also nicely designed. ,5,2019,07,10
21,Nice and modern hotel but noisy,"The hotel is new and modern. With a very nice design. It has an amazing pool. 

Rooms have a size big enough, with a huge shower. But they are not perfectly isolated. It is hearing noises from the corridor and pipes.

",4,2019,07,08
21,Superb!,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Sofia Barcelona for 3 nights with my husband .  The recently renovated hotel is beautiful and modern with the latest technologies.  The room was very spacious and and beautifully appointed.  But the highest praise goes to the staff who were extremely pleasant and very helpful. We did not pre-plan any excursions for our stay in Barcelona, but the concierges were fabulous in assisting us in sightseeing recommendations and ticketing.  They were instrumental in making our stay in Barcelona exceptional.",5,2019,07,08
21,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff","One often heard phrase especially from the Human Resources department of any Corporation is that people are it’s most important resource.  Especially in the service industry.  And at the Hotel SOFIA Barcelona in the unbound collection by Hyatt, the service oriented staff really make the difference.  

It is a luxurious hotel.  Beautifully designed rooms.  I like the double wash basin, the extremely comfortable king bed and the glass walled shower with rain shower - very intimate for couples.  It also has little convenience features like sensor lights and motorised blinds. 
There are two restaurants and a nice bar.  And a wellness and spa to pamper yourself.  All very nice for a very comfortable stay. 

But it’s the staff, it’s people that stand out.  Warm and welcoming at the check in, Marie Claire and Matthieu it’s a great first impression. 
Arriving late in at nite, tired from a Long journey, you made it a breeze to check in and all very pleasantly.  Matthieu from the concierge desk who heard our plans, shared very useful ideas with us in a very friendly and genuinely helpful manner. The concierge desk truly stands out.  Christian, thank you for putting aside what you and Adrian were working on to help me with my plan for the day.  They carried it out promptly and as if it was the most important task, in a friendly manner.  It was the most luxurious touch - being treated as an individual - this luxurious hotel offered. HR, these are important people in the company.  ",5,2019,07,08
21,Wished our stay was longer!,"Very impressed by the little details of this hotel design and customer service. The reason I booked was bc of the great reviews and our stay lived up to it. I am now looking into other Unbound Collections by Hyatt for future stays, if they are similar to this. ",5,2019,07,06
21,One of the Best hotel,"It is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. Staff were very helpful. I ordered food from room service several times and i found it is very delicious. Very good location. It is located walking distance to “Maria Cristina ”, Starbucks, restaurants, shopping mall, Camp nou stadium, .. etc",5,2019,07,06
21,Great but minor issues," The rooms are beautiful clean and pur Stay was just Perfect and the over all impression is fantastic. BUT they defnitely need to improve the Service during dinner!!! everything else is just fantastic. ",4,2019,07,03
21,"Great stay, great hotel, great staff","My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Sofia very much. The hotel is beautiful, modern and very clean. The views are nice and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and cared for. Kudos to Matteau the Concierge for his amazing service and knowledge and general friendliness. The bathroom was delightful and spa like, and we slept very well in the amazing bed. Look forward to another visit in the future!",5,2019,07,02
21,Love this place,The only place to be able to relax  and enjoy your family time with special people i really  recommend  Everyone to visit the beautiful beautiful hotel this is my fourth time in this hotel i just love it ,5,2019,07,01
21,"Nice comfortable stay at Sofia Hotel, Barcelona","I stayed at the Sofia hotel Barcelona while traveling on work for a global business conference.

The hotel is extremely modern and very close to Camp Nou for all the football enthusiasts.

Las Ramblas is a small 10 minute, 10€ taxi ride away.
The breakfast was very good with an excellent spread.

Although the cost per stay is high but then it is a premium five star hotel.

Recommended for business travel.
",4,2019,07,01
21,Good modern hotel both for business and private tours,"Hotel is fresh after the recent re-modeling, located near Barcelona football club and stadium and next to the University campus in expensive housing zone. 
Cuisine is ok, service is really excellent at reception and room service but not as good as you may expect in the restaurant. 
Rooms are big and comfortable. Smart elevators - be ready they might be smarter than you are ;)",5,2019,06,28
21,2nd visit,"This was our second visit to this fantastic hotel having been last October.  To celebrate a special birthday we returned and were not disapponted.  The service from all the staff went above and beyond and it made our holiday a very special one.  Huge thanks has to go to Christian, one of the concierge staff.  His help prior to our holiday to ensure the best service and seats at all the lovely restaurants we visited as well as advice and assistance during our stay is one of the many reasons this hotel deserves its 5* rating.",5,2019,06,24
21,Beautiful Hotel,"Really nice hotel with fantastic rooms - loved the shower :-)
Friendly and professionel staff - good breakfast.
Would have liked to stay for Holiday but a bit too expensive for that and distance to Rambla too far",4,2019,06,17
21,I am unhappy,"The Sofia hotel is relatively new and tries to be cool by labeling everything starting with ""I am"". The nearby bookstore is called ""I am ...""

Because the hotel is so new, everything looks modern and clean. The rooms are spacious and stylish. There's a huge flat screen tv in every room, but this is were trouble starts. All menu's were in Spanish and most channels are Spanish. If you do find an English channel, chances are it's dubbed in Spanish. Other channels are listed, but don't actually work. Being unable to navigate through unreadable Spanish menu's to switch to English, I am done with the tv.

The room service menu is labelled ""I am hungry"". But when I was hungry, I couldn't find a single item I liked. The Sofia hotel doesn't list a single vegan or vegetarian item on the menu. So I didn't order anything for lunch.

I was in the Sofia hotel for a big event, which used a buffet style dinner from the restaurant. Again: no vegan food. When I explained: no meat, no dairy, no eggs I was offered fish. How silly can you be? Fish is a dead animal, hence: meat. The staff was still helpful and brought me rice and vegetables. This tasted okay, but I had a stomach ache for the rest of the night and hardly slept because of the bad food. The following morning I still felt yesterday's dinner sitting in my stomach like a brick. I feel this wasn't free of animal products afterall.

In order to be modern, the Sofia hotel has USB sockets and 220 volt power outlets. That's great, but the location is wrong: next to the desk. One wants to charge a phone during the night, next to the bed! A phone tells time and functions as an alarm clock. The 220 volt outlet is just too far from the bed to watch a film on a laptop while charging it. Have the designers actually spent a night in a hotel before designing this?

Another mistake is with the light switches: they glow in the dark to make them easy to find, but the icons are not backlighted so the guest doesn't know what the function of each switch is in the dark. Somehow the control for curtains is labelled ""black out"" instead of just ""curtain"".

When I wanted to take a shower in the morning, I could only find slippers labelled ""I am small"". And those slippers were small indeed: children's size! After a phone call to the reception, house keeping appeared at my door within 3 minutes bringing bigger slippers (labelled: ""I am big""). Why aren't these in the room by default? Do adults not use the bathroom? After showering the bathroom was flooded. I first needed towels to dry to floor, then used the remaining towels to dry myself.

During my stay a member of staff came to my room to bring chocolate and water. The lady didn't speak English and I didn't understand why this was brought to my room. Nor could I convince her that I wasn't interested in milk chocolate (not vegan!). I am sorry, but if staff doesn't speak English they don't belong in an international hotel. Or at least they shouldn't be allowed contact with foreign guests.

Breakfast at the Impar restaint in the hotel was like the final insult. The selection of bread is very limited. However, the Impar restaurant does offer a wide selection of nuts and fruits. Both seemed to be of very high quality. However, in the central room hanging legs of dead animals are used as decoration. Animals are living, breathing beings, not decoration. What a lack of respect to animals, and what an insult to vegan or vegetarian guests!

In short: the Sofia hotel looks beautiful, but makes a lot of mistakes that could easily be avoided. Fix the tv, move the power sockets, fix the bathroom and train the kitchen staff in preparing proper vegan food. Because all of these mistakes I am unhappy and I won't be back.",2,2019,06,13
21,Barcelona first time,"Located along avenues diagonal on the very outskirts of eixample near football stadium and by university of barcelona and maternity hospital campus. Very quiet relaxing place. Very nice pool and outside patio areas. Spa is great
 Good views of mt tidibado and of sunrise. ",5,2019,06,12
21,Excellent stay,"Wonderful hotel! The rooms are beautiful and well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. The spa with jaquzzi was amazing. Every member of the staff was very welcoming, helpful efficient and friendly. ",5,2019,06,11
21,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel.  Very nice rooms.  Great facilities.  Staff were excellent!  They were very friendly, knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  Located in a nice upscale area, but not as close to the central tourist area of Plaza Cataluña (about a 10-15 min cab ride).",5,2019,06,10
21,Outstanding customer service!,"My family and I (two adults, two children 8 and 9 years old) was visiting Hotel Sofia Barcelona in February 2019. I cannot fault the hotel for anything, I was just so happy and satisfied with everything! Customer service was outstanding from every member of the staff, they made us feel very comfortable and welcome and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. The hotel has beautifully designed rooms as well as restaurant. The hotel room was high tech with different very impressive features and the hotel also has a turn-down service in the evening. Breakfast was good, enough to choose from, healthy, but also gourmet options. We tried the restaurant for dinner too and we thought both food and wine were impeccable! 
I treated myself with a session in the spa. My very stressful life situation was literally left behind the door when I entered the spa. The spa therapists are very professional and also the treatment itself exceeded my expectations, it was more than I expected. I totally got in zen mode! The spa was well equipped with steam room, ice room, a huge jacuzzi...and much more.
A special praise to one of the hotel´s concierges whose advice really made our trip!! He managed to listen very well to our wishes and needs and picked out a nice set of sighseeings and also good restaurants to visit!
I can imagine this hotel is very nice in the summer, with the outdoor pool and terrace. I absolutely loved this hotel and will definitely be returning!  ",5,2019,06,05
21,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I am a Hyatt member, and stumbled upon this gem of a hotel.  It is located in the business district, which may only be the only downside if you are looking to stay near all the action.  From the moment you enter this hotel, you feel like you arrived home. The staff is unsurpassed, from the doormen, to the reception desk, and the incredible concierge.  Special shout out to Matthew and Christian for going the extra mile.  All their guidance, and recommendations helped make this visit extra special.  Another added bonus, is the spa. You are invited to use the facilities at no cost, for one day. What a nice touch.  The restaurants are also superior.  Be So might have been one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Nico, the sommelier, not only gave us a fabulous wine tasting, but an education as well.  The chef prepares the food with love.  Can't wait to return to my new home away from home!!!",5,2019,06,05
21,Good new hotel!,I was there before the renovation and came back last year when the hotel reopened again. Very nice surprise with new rooms and very nice staff. Good restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Very nice renovation with a good location too.,5,2019,06,05
21,Disappointing has issues,This hotel has been refurbished and is very model not very practical at all. The pool outside isntba pool it's a puddle and no where near enough sunbeds for the size of hotel and large spaces outside that could be used better.  Quality of food leaves a lot to be desired for a 5 star hotel.,2,2019,06,01
21,"Great Wish Suite, your only wish is to stay there permanently :)","Amazing suite....  amazing Wish service team...  amazing food at the hotel BeSo fine dining restaurant... probably the best suite experience I had among all the Hyatt chain of hotels around the world.

The Wish Recepcion take care of all our needs even getting us a nice table in the exclusive 4 hands dinner with a guest Michelin chef from Madrid...  

Probably the only thing that can be better than a Great Wish Suite in Barcelona is the Best Wish Suite.  :)

The hotel is not too far from the city center and is conveniently served by Metro, Trams, and buses.  We tried them all.  The Taxis we took in Barcelona were also honest and helpful as compared to some in Paris which tried to overcharge us.

And the breakfast in the hotel has a nice spread, but the main thing that impressed us was they served Echiré butter for the breakfast buffet.  If you are into butter you know this is the epitome of the finest butter in the world.....  bad for diet plan though.... ;)

21,A Truly Great Hotel,"Efficiant with a staff that realky go out of their way to help you:  they arranged all the bookings i needed and made a few valuble sggestions,  with no fuss and no flurry!   Great comfortable rooms, well furnished and superclean.  I found it great to be away from the bustle of the center and in a quiet suburb because a 10 minute taxi ride took me right to the center.  It is also a 10 minute walk away from the underground which, in Barcelona, is efficient and easy to use ",5,2019,05,30
21,Great hotel near the stadium,"Great staff, super polite and helpful. Extraordinarily designed rooms with separate toilet, bathroom and washing area. Big room, not very well isolated and you could hear noises from other neighboring rooms. Nevertheless, great overall experience. ",5,2019,05,24
21,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"I just returned from traveling to Barcelona for the first time and loved this hotel.  The location was terrific, my only regret was not realizing the hotel was mentioned in the novel I was reading until after!

Taxis picked up right in front of the hotel if you did not go to the bell captain and if you wanted to experience the city via hop on hop off bus, the stop was 1/4 block away (along with a Starbucks!)

We made sure to experience the restaurant Sofia Be So, and loved that they paired wines and entrees based on an aroma test prior to dining!  

My only regret is that we were so busy experiencing the city, that I did not have the opportunity to go to the spa.",5,2019,05,24
21,"Great hotel, great people","Great standard, great staff.
People working at this place are very nice and helpfull.
Standard is great, food - delicious. Room's are clean. All what you need you have :)
It was a please to stay in this hotel for 3 days (2 nights).",5,2019,05,23
21,Excellent Barcelona hotel,"This hotel, near the University, is a wonderful find in Barcelona.  It is a modern luxury hotel with a staff that is as friendly and helpful as any I have encountered.  The rooms are spacious, with large bathrooms.  They are high-tech, which took me a minute to figure out, but well worth it.  It is slightly off the downtown beaten path, but provides for a wonderful walk along the Diagonal to the more touristy areas.  I will look forward to returning there.",5,2019,05,20
21,Lovely modern space with amazing staff,"Hubby and stayed here for the F1 race and our first ever go a it to Barcelona. While it's not close to the sights we still enjoyed our visit very much. Bed was super comfortable and the shower was delightfully spa like. Nice views from the hotel, menus at restaurants we're good and breakfast lovely. The shining star for us was Matteau, the concierge. (spelling? My French is poor.) He was a delight to visit with, gave us unparralled assistance and advice/suggestions. Like the other staff here we encountered he was warm and genuine while helping us. His service was much appreciated. I would recommend a stay here, but be ready to walk a lot, ride subways and pay hefty taxi fees. Maybe a better spot exists for tourists due to this, but biz travellers would love it. ",4,2019,05,18
21,Superb hotel,"The Hotel SOFIA is classy, comfortable and extremely hospitable.  We were quite pleased with the high level of service and attention from all hotel departments and the food was amazing!  The room was comfortable and spacious (for a European hotel) and extremely clean.  I would highly recommend!",5,2019,05,15
21,Glad to be back,"I have stopped at the sofia on many occasions pre refurb. This was the second visit since the refurbishment. Everything is perfect! The look the feel the food and the atmosphere it is everything you would expect.

The sofia is not centrally locates but bony let that put you off. There are ships restaurants and bars all in a stands throw of the hotel. 

",4,2019,05,06
21,Dreadful,"Not central at all. I saw this hotel advertised in conde Nast as a central urban chic place to stay. It’s nowhere near anything.
Rude staff.
Really hard work to communicate with the staff.
240 euros for a late check-out.",1,2019,04,29
21,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"My room was incredible. High-tech appliances TV, Bathroom all up to date. Incredible big bed. Amazing big Hyatt breakfast in the morning. Very nice gym on the bottom floor. 

The best staff in Barcelona. I was treated like a true Princess. Very close to the Camp Nou stadium. Walking distance on the Diagonal to the best shopping in barcelona. Very good for businesses. Nice outdoor pool. I never wanted to leave. Went over and above for the guests. Especially, thank you to Oriol for going over and above for me and my family. Everyone was the best. Also ZUU club on the bottom level has great shows! 
Highly recommend, the best spot in Barcelona. Best staff around.",5,2019,04,27
21,Excellent room and perfect breakfast 😃,"Great experience overall, withe highlights being room quality, services provided, breakfast quality and variety. 
Staff helpfullness all the time.
The proximity to central areas of the city and nearby Barcelona club stadium is a plus!",5,2019,04,26
21,Biggest Bathrooms ever,"I had to stay in Barcelona for a while. Given my client's location, the competitor's flagship hotel was too far away and I was planning to stay for work anyhow.
I was very impressed with the interior design, the size of the slightly upgraded room and in particular the humongous bathroom, which would easily fit a bowling alley...

Lovely service all around. ",5,2019,04,23
21,A big upgrade to this hotel,I stayed at this property 4 years ago and I’m happy I came back now to see how much it improved with the remodeling and the great service. The food at the restaurants is great and all of them with a contemporary touch. The service is very professional and every employee is paying attention to customer needs 100% of the time. A great surprise! ,5,2019,04,18
21,In love,It was in a nice location and LOVED everything about the place. The staff was the best ever and the design and layout was truly delightful. The beds we're marvelous and every person helped out so much. Even more than I would have naturally asked for but it was truly welcomed. The were all fabulous.,5,2019,04,18
21,Great Property,"I am still raving about this property. We loved everything from the welcome to the goodbye from the staff. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here while in Barcelona. The restaurant food was great, the spa was phenomenal.  ",5,2019,04,16
21,Great and modern hotel,A very green conciencious hotel. Very modern with motion sensors. Elevator can be slow during peak hours if there is a conference going on. Hotel staff are great and so in in room amenities. Good location if you are going to a Barca home game!,5,2019,04,14
21,Nice design hotel,"We went for a business event and the hotel overall was nice. Very modern design, beautiful entrance, nice elevators with an unusual functioning system with no button inside. 

Rooms were small but nicely decorated. 
The food was good both breakfast and lunch. 
Great spanish ham and salad and international cuisine. 

The location is frankly not great but fine for a business meeting. 
",4,2019,04,13
21,Fine business hotel,"Close to Camp Nou, only a walkind distance. Reception staff was fine, library bar staff was unattentive, doormen were extremely helpful and friendly, they were a great help for us. Restaurant looks nice. 
",4,2019,04,13
21,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Our family of 6 traveled to Barcelona for a family vacation, and got very lucky to choose Hotel Sofia. The location couldn't have been better because we went to a Barcelona game at Camp Nou and were able to walk in just a couple of minutes. Luis, Christian, Mathieu, Sofie & the rest of the staff were top notch! They went above and beyond to make sure that our stay there was amazing. The hotel is modern and always very clean.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. ",5,2019,04,12
21,Wonderful. Friendly staff and fantastic interior,The experience was great. The staff were amazing - very attentive and the interiors and amenities are great. Gym and spa are wonderful too! Definitely recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure ,5,2019,04,06
21,An excellent hotel,"Hotel Sofia is a wonderful hotel. From the time of booking the stay to the time we left and everything in between we were met with the friendliest and most helpful staff. I could not even name a particular staff that stood out from another as they were all professional and friendly. The hotel is conveniently located on a major road in a very safe area. Shopping and eating are only a few minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel breakfast is fantastic with hot foods including scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausages to fresh fruit (including berries, melons and bananas) fresh orange juice,  and hot beverages, to pastries, bread, croissants and muffins. Everything extremely fresh. 
The rooms are nicely appointed, modern and highly technological with turn down service. The beds and pillows are sooo comfortable. The spa is definitely a must visit place. The concierge was extremely helpful in planning our activities. 
I would suggest the hop on hop off bus to see the sights. It is an economical way to see all of Barcelona in a day or two (There is a stop two minutes from the hotel). Public transportation is only minutes away including the Metro, taxi, bus and tram. Camp Nou is a 5 - 10 minute walk away. If you are a soccer fan, squeeze in time for a soccer game. We were so impressed with the personalized attention to detail that Hotel Sofia offers. We would highly recommend to everyone for exceptional service, impeccable cleanliness, extreme comfort and relaxation and the friendliness/helpfulness of the staff.",5,2019,04,05
21,Amazing Hotel!!,"Beautiful Hotel. Very Courteous, Attentive, and Friendly staff. Very comfortable beds and modern rooms. Great Food! If you’re looking for a Great 5 Star Hotel choose the Sofia! We can’t wait to go back!",5,2019,04,04
21,"Hidden gem, off the beaten path ...","While the hotel is a bit outside of the busy city centre, this is more a benefit than an issue. A quick metro ride takes you to downtown Barcelona and even to the airport. The level of quality of the hotel facilities and the courtesy and dedication of the staff surpass what you would expect of a hotel in this price range. Definitely worth considering when you want to enjoy Barcelona, but don't always want to be in the crowds... oh, and for football fans, Camp Nou is right around the corner ;-)",5,2019,04,04
21,Amazing Hotel!!,"The Hotel Sofia was impressive from the first moment we arrived.  We were greeted by 4 people outside and the service for our entire week was unbelievable.  Everyone there was so nice and helpful and Carlos, the manager, was amazing.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are state of the art with modern amenities.  The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, the shower was great and everything was very clean.  No complaints at all, highly recommend!",5,2019,04,03
21,Great stay with friendly staff,"The hotel was absolutely amazing and the staffs was very friendly and happy to help anytime in anyway they could.Facilities were top class and deserves 5star.
Would like to wish million thanks to concierge staff Christian Braseuq who was been very kind and assist us in every single way throughout our 5 days of stay.
Keep it guys.",5,2019,03,27
21,We absolutely enjoyed it,"The SOFIA Hotel was a perfect place for our city trip to Barcelona. The interior design, the Spa, the breakfast buffet, everything was really nice. Never experienced so helpful and friendly staff in any other Hyatt Hotel. The location is very good though not in the very center of the city, but Metro line is very close and some areas like Gracia are even in walking distance. ",5,2019,03,27
21,Very good option for a stay in Barcelona,This hotel has been renovated and is extremely pleasant. Rooms are very well designed and equipped. The Spa is particularly good. Th location can't be better. I also used the meeting rooms which are well planned.,4,2019,03,25
21,Beautiful hotel with impeccable service!,"Stayed here twice this month for sessions at IESE Business School.  Very convenient location near the school and a short taxi ride to the city center.  Quite a few shopping malls nearby including El Corte Ingles and an El Fornet bakery across the street from the hotel.  Was checked in both times by Alexiane who was extremely warm and friendly and Sofia showed me to the room my first stay.  Both provided an exceptional welcome to Barcelona and their hotel.  The rooms were very well designed and high tech.  Not overly technical that it’s still user friendly and many details very well though out from the motion sensor bathroom and nightlights.  They use Natura Bisse as their bathroom amenity line, use very high quality towels, and proper, Swiss Valera hair dryers.  The bed sheets are incredibly soft and the bed is super comfy with a luxurious pillow topper on a medium firm mattress.  The free water was nice/fancy and housekeeping was on point during turndown service.  Gym is very nice!",5,2019,03,25
21,Close to FC Barcelona,"Great hotel, just a short walk from the Camp Nou.  Perfect spot to stay when attending a match. Beautiful property with outstanding rooms and service.  Hotel was recently renovated and they did an amazing job.  Make sure you check the bar off the lobby.  It is hidden, so don't miss it.",5,2019,03,18
21,A Must Stay!,"Although The Sofia Hotel is not in the center of Barcelona it is well worth the stay.  The service/staff, design, warmth, spa, restaurants, etc is the best I have been in for a hotel chain.  If you can splurge a little I highly recommend the So Suite Room.  Don't miss this hotel",5,2019,03,17
21,"Beautiful , lovely & comfortable",The hotel is at very good location . The FCB is at throw away distance from the hotel . The hotel is very silent with good spread in breafast . The rooms were very comfortable although small in size . I enjoyed my stay there as i was there for 5 nights .,4,2019,03,17
21,Amazing!,"Everything was amazing from the moment I walked in. I couldn’t have asked for more attention, courtesy. I would go back there anytime I’m in Barcelona. The location is perfect. Highly recommend. Thank you very much!",5,2019,03,15
21,Excellent quality hotel,"We stayed at the SOFIA 4 nights. When we arrived we were treated very well. Our concierge, Christian, was outstanding with terrific customer service and plenty of suggestions for food (always on the mark). 
The hotel is absolutely gorgeous with a very modern and comfortable feel. The spa is one of the nicest we have seen. 
Our only concern was that the hotel wasn’t central to tourism but if you are comfortable with the Metro then it’s not an issue as there is a Station very nearby and less than a 15min ride to the major attractions in Barcelona. ",5,2019,03,14
21,lovely and comfortable,close enough to both the airport and the city. beautiful and well equipped rooms. awesome service from bellmen. food at the 1mpar restaurant was very good especially when sharing as portions were large. recommended for business. ,5,2019,03,13
21,Jewel in Barcelona ,"The Sofia hotel in Barcelona is a luxury hotel in every sense of the word.  It is located in the university section of Barcelona, a five minute walk from the Barcelona football stadium, not in the usual tourist section. But it is near the metro and travel in Barcelona is easy.

You enter a spacious, modern  lobby  which gives you a taste of what lies beyond.  The rooms are spacious and very tastefully decorated.The beds are extremely comfortable.  The room, including the bathroom, have motion sensors which turn on small floor lights so that you can immediately get your bearings, go where you want to or turn on whatever light you want. The curtains to the large windows close with the push of a button.

The bathroom is by far the largest that I have seen, including suites in luxury hotels.  There is a spacious stall shower and a large Roman tub. The shower is somewhat unusual in that the overhead shower and the handheld shower can work simultaneously without any loss of pressure. Not necessary, but a nice touch. There is no lack of amenities in the bathroom. Traveling with my son, each taking at least two showers a day, we are always running out of shampoo and body gel. The daily supply here is enough for a sports team.  The only thing I find strange is that there is a smoked glass, see through door on the shower, which I have seen before, but there is also one on the toilet. I would certainly prefer a little more privacy and hope that the management can make some change.

While the physical layout of the hotel is it superb, nothing compares with the service that is offered here. Everyone goes way way out of their way to help you and make you feel comfortable.  It started two days before arrival when I received an email from the concierge offering to arrange for an airport pick up. Arriving from New York at 9 AM I dreaded having to wait in the hotel lobby until 3 PM for a normal check-in. Checking my email while waiting for my luggage at the airport I was pleasantly shocked to get a note saying that my room was already and waiting for me. This type of treatment continued throughout my stay. Everyone you meet continuously asks if they can help you in one way or another.  I am used to excellent service from all of the many Hyatt hotel that I have stayed at, but this is at a higher level than I have experienced before.

This is truly a 5 star hotel, but surprisingly economical.  Whether you are in Barcelona for business or pleasure I recommend the Sofia most highly. 
",5,2019,03,13
21,Magnificent!,"It's always great when you show up to a nice hotel and the staff make you feel like they actually WANT you to be there, that they appreciate you. This was our experience of our recent stay at Hotel Sofia Barcelona. Every single person we encountered from our initial interaction with Erica at the from desk to the concierge Luis who helped us many, many times. The 'smart room' is super-cool and the Spa is tremendous. Overall fabulous stay and highly recommended!",5,2019,03,10
21,Fantastic Hotel,"From the very first minute you walk in the door the experience at Hotel Sofia is fantastic. The reception staff were friendly and this trend continued throughout my stay (6 nights).  The breakfast at Impar is good and once again service was excellent. The coffee shop and bar in the hotel are both worth visiting.  The hotel rooms are well laid out although the desks are small for working at and the lighting is not great for working in the room (not any different to many other hotels around the world).  

The hotel is about 15 mins by taxi from the centre of Barcelona but very convenient for Camp Nou and IESE Business School. We never struggled to get a taxi and the doorman were always on hand to assist with translating if required.

I would highly recommend Hotel Sofia.",5,2019,03,08
21,Another great stay,I usually stay at the Hotel Sofia when I visit Barcelona on business as the location is perfect for me.  The staff is very friendly and always greets me so pleasantly upon my return each day.  The restaurant is consistently great for breakfast and the room is extremely comfortable and quiet.  I'll be back soon.,5,2019,03,07
21,The Most Impressive Service and Atmosphere in Barcelona,"The reason for my review is to make the hotel and future clients aware of Christian Brasero and his amazing professional and personal qualities.  I was recently stayed at this hotel with my company for our annual conference.  

I have had the pleasure of staying Hotel SOFIA for my 3 past visits to Barcelona (two were for professional meetings with my company and once on a personal trip with my wife).  The reason I am more than happy to return is because of people like Christian.  In all my professional and personal travels all over the world, I have yet to meet or interact with a hotel employee like I have with Christian.  He truly goes above and beyond to make my stay as stress free and enjoyable as possible.  What truly makes me feel welcome is that he remembers me; recalling me from my previous visits.  I do not feel like just a customer, but rather someone that is valued.  Going that extra mile to recognize previous clients, that’s what sets apart an excellent employee from a good employee.  He strives to make my stay as comfortable as possible, making sure the room is situated and stocked to my needs.  He has assisted me in procuring the amazing olive oil from Impar and facilitating that transaction so that it is easy as possible.  Because of someone like Christian, I have no reason to ever consider another hotel when visiting Barcelona.  

There are not enough superlatives to describe Christian.  He is a one of a kind employee and he truly is a reason I look forward to returning to Barcelona.  I hope the hotel recognizes how lucky they are to have someone like him within their organization.  

I want to thank Christian, and Hotel SOFIA's entire staff for always making my visits to Barcelona welcoming, personal, and memorable.",5,2019,03,05
21,Awesome luxury hotel by FC Barcelona Camp Nou,"Sofia is a luxury hotel away from the bustle of downtown Barcelona but still close to everything. Rooms are great, especially the suites with the huge bathroom. Staff is super helpful. Concierges have contacts everywhere. Breakfast is everything you could want. Easy access to public transportation. Simply a great place to stay. ",5,2019,03,05
21,Most Friendly and helpful staff!,"I had the pleasure to meet wonderful front desk  staff Albert, Isaac and Matteo at Sofia hotel during the Mobile World Congress. We had a plan for a short one day trip. They suggested Cadaqués  and prepared us a most detailed itinerary! We ended up spending  two days  there worry free and totally enjoyed it!  Could not expected and turn out better!  Thanks guys, and definitely look forward to going back there again.",5,2019,03,05
21,Very impressive service,"Best service I've experienced at a hotel in Barcelona in 10 years of travelling there, and good location, not far from Cortes Ingles department store. I stayed in Infinity room. Very clean, comfortable room, but a little dark. May need to bring a lamp if you need to work from your room. Also, make sure you specifically ask for a room with a desk if you will need one as not all have them (mine didn't). The bed and pillows were the best I've experience (my colleagues all thought so too). I stayed during MWC show when prices are extremely high, but I think it would be good value for money in the off-peak season. Overall, a very pleasant experience!",5,2019,03,03
21,Princess Sofia hotel,"nice updated hotel in a very good location. The front office staff is  great and the restaurant impair has very good breakfast. Overall a comfortable hotel, my only complain is the light in the guest room, its low and the switches are confusing ",4,2019,03,02
21,Luxury in Barcelona,"From the moment you step foot to the moment you leave, it is pure luxury.  The ambience, care to detail, the service.. Everything is pure quality.  I stayed in the suite which was an exceptional size with a bathroom so spacious, clean and luxurious you could enjoy a dinner in there   The suite was very well thought through, from automatic lights, a bar, ample room / storage, quality fittings etc. .  Everything felt clean which you don't find in many hotels  .   The spa is out of this world - hot plunge, cold plunge,  steam shower, sauna, caldarium, salt room, ice room, relax room!  You could spend hours in there... Its priced at 45€ per visit .   Location is a little out, but the experience is totally worth it!   If you are looking for a luxury experience in Barcelona... Look no further! ",5,2019,03,02
21,Sofia hotel,I have an excellent experience in sofia hotel very nice hotel excellent services specially the booking of the football game whith one of their employees his name is Chrestian he did all the reservations in the best seats in the Camp Nou we were treated as i VIP in the hotel and the stadium  .,5,2019,02,25
21,Business Feb 2019,"Stayed here for business for almost a full week. Great hotel with wonderful staff. The only downfall was it wasn't local to much,  always a cab or bus ride away from everything besides the soccer stadium. Room was great, 
spacious but didn't see any plug ins close to the sink for hair straighteners etc, was a stretch of the cord. Would definitely stay here again though!",5,2019,02,23
21,Outstanding hotel with great service,"This hotel is very clean. Rooms are big and spacious. Food is very good and staff are extraordinary friendly and delivers outstanding service.
Great restaurant, spa and wellness area
Walking distance to Camp Nou",5,2019,02,20
21,5 stars for 5 days!,"Great hotel! You never lift a bag or have to get your own cab. The roo. Is so comfortable and very sleek. Perfect for work or vacation. The only minus, if you are. Work trip the elevators become a long wait. ",5,2019,02,17
21,Enjoyed our stay.,"My wife and I went there in late January, as I was attending a conference. We stayed a few days extra to explore the city.  The hotel is in a good location, and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. My wife enjoyed the spa a lot too.  A few of my colleagues stayed there as well, and were pretty satisfied.   Could see the Barcelona stadium, Camp Nou, from parts of the hotel!",5,2019,02,16
21,Taking customer service to an entirely new level,"As a Hyatt Globalist member, I could not be more thrilled to have this amazing property added to the company's portfolio.  

Upon arriving at the hotel, I received a warm welcome from Matteo (a wonderful ambassador for the property) at the front desk who described the benefits I would receive through my Globalist status.  As others have noted, the lobby (and entire hotel, for that matter) is very chic and modern but simultaneously provides a sense of calm and tranquility.  

My junior suite was the perfect size for me.  The bedding was extremely comfortable - I loved being enveloped by a giant, fluffy comforter each night.  The bathroom was one of the largest I've ever seen in a hotel - complete with double sinks, a clawfoot tub and a rain shower - all were evenly spaced out.  

In terms of the area surrounding the hotel, I have never stayed in the ""business district"" in Barcelona (I used quotes because it didn't feel like a traditional business district - there were only a few large buildings and the streets weren't packed like most typical BD's).  The subway is a five minute walk from the hotel and took approximately 20 minutes to reach the city center - very easy to navigate.  

The real star of the hotel is the staff.  I regularly stay in excess of 60 nights at Hyatt properties each year - I can unequivocally say that the staff was one of the most attentive, helpful and accommodating that I have come across.  They consistently went above and beyond to make my stay more enjoyable.

Soon after checking-in and arriving in my room, Christian, one of the absolute stars at the hotel, called to introduce himself and to let him know if there was anything which I needed.  I inquired about ticket options for the Barca football game.  He came back to me quickly with multiple options and also offered his opinions when taking into consideration the location of the seats, the price and the weather (it had rained that evening).  I had a fantastic experience at the game (five minute walk from the hotel).  

There was a taxi strike during the weekend of my stay and ride-sharing options were largely unavailable.  However, each day, Christian provided very clear instructions on reaching my destinations - and he even checked in with me throughout the day via text message to ensure that I was finding everything without problems.

Lastly, Christian was most helpful in assisting me with one somewhat unusual request.  I was traveling alone and wanted to bring paella back to the US.  After what I suspect were many calls to various restaurants, he found an establishment which was able to vacuum seal the paella for me.  I picked up the paella and brought it back to the hotel, where he arranged for it to be placed in one of the freezers in order to avoid spoilage.

I would be remiss to not mention others who also made my stay more special - Matteo at the front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming.  Blanka provide a tour of the Wish floor with beautifully appointed suites and a large lounge.  Jorge and Pol in the lobby along with the entire staff and Impar restaurant were proactive and attentive and always carried a smile on their face.

I was stunned as to the lengths the staff went to make this a special trip for me.  

I've clearly fallen in love with the property and can't wait to return.  Others who are looking to stay here will not be disappointed!",5,2019,02,13
21,Great roon and staffs,"The Wish suit is stylish and spacious. All staffs are very helpful and friendly, especially Michael. Got some excellent advices about the spots in Barcelona. 
The location is within 5 minute walking distance from Camp Nou, and is close to the L3 metro station for going to centre Barcelona.",5,2019,02,12
21,5 nights at the Sofia,"Great hotel, spacious rooms, latest technology, sophisticated, scrumptious breakfast, friendly and helpful staff all around, great location with easy access to transportation. Highly recommended for personal or business stay",5,2019,02,02
21,"Outstanding location, experience, customer care.","The Hotel Sofia has mastered customer experience from the moment you pull up to the facility, to the serene lobby, the attentive staff, the luxurious rooms. Care and precision has been used to design and implement an amazing experience from start to finish. ",5,2019,01,31
21,Amazing ,We have recently stayed at the Sofia. What an amazing experience! The hotel is fabulous and the staff can’t help you enough. We happened to be staying the weekend of taxi strikes! The hotel looked after us with transportation to make my life easier as a full time wheelchair user. The hotel was full accessible and the everyone did everything they could to make our weekend relaxed and enjoyable. Christian on the concierge was fantastic - what an amazing young man with a great attitude to customers. Thank you Sofia for a fabulous stay with you. We will be back. The best hotel in Barcelona by far ! ,5,2019,01,25
21,The staff and the hotel are the best in Barcelona,The staff and the hotel are the best in Barcelona. The hotel is very pretty and the facilities are great. For me the only thing they could make improvements is on the variety of the breakfast. The breakfast is great but it’s not amazing. Once again the star of this hotel is the all staff.,5,2019,01,19
21,great stay in a great hotel!,"Very close to Camp Nou and close to metro! Our stay here was magnificent. Really great hotel with super-rooms, nice beds and over all a very good breakfast on the upper floor with great views! Nice very helpful staff!",5,2019,01,03
21,Amazing Experience ,"The hotel and its amenities are top class. Stunning rooms and great onsite restaurants and bars. The views from the 19th floor aren’t to be missed!

We hosted a multi-day conference and were very impressed with facilities and food. 

Service for lunch in the main restaurant can be slow. ",5,2018,12,30
21,Best service ever ! ,"I had the best experience ever at sofia . On of the best hotel in barcelona.  Its a little far from the center but its worth to stay in . The environment is great and the design is modern and cozy. The stuff there is very helpful and friendly. I had an issue with a lost bag and they help us to return it to my country.  Speacial thank to “christian “ from the concierge desck for his help and collaboration. He work every day to follow up with the airport lost item department to find our lost language. 
I will definitely come back to barcelona and stay again in sofia . ",5,2018,12,19
21,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at,"From the moment the taxi pulled up outside and we stepped into the lobby we knew we had discovered an amazing hotel. The check-in staff were marvellous and very welcoming, especially Matthieu who was very keen to help and friendly.  Our room was not quite ready but we were made comfortable around the lovely pool area. 

Our room, 1602, was very well equipped, comfortable, hi-tech and clean albeit rather small. There was no dressing table/desk and as 2 ladies we found that inconvenient and little too cosy! The beds were extremely comfortable and we enjoyed an extensive pillow menu. The bathroom however was very generous and again very well equipped with lovely linens, toiletries and a fantastic shower. 

Breakfast and Dinner at Impar was superb. Staff and food were faultless. The choice at breakfast was outstanding. We enjoyed dinner twice at Impar, firstly from the ala carte menu and on the second occasion from the buffet and they were both incredible.

The spa whilst beautiful was having issues when we visited and the jets were not functioning properly in the pool which was very disappointing as we were very much looking forward to it. However, I did have two wonderful treatments, expensive but extremely good. 

The highlight of the hotel were the staff, each and every one we encountered were welcoming and obliging.  The concierge service was without doubt the best I’ve ever come across. Christian was professional, incredibly helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable.  He quite simply made our holiday and he will be the main reason we would return for another stay. Also, Luis’ restaurant recommendations were divine; amazing tapas on one night and a special dinner at Windsor on another which ended up being one of the most memorable dinners of my life. 

All in all, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and one I will be recommending to friends and family. ",5,2018,12,14
21,Welcome back!,"Was happy to hear that SOFIA had reopened thier esteemed establishment! Booked my stay for a week last October. The property had a complete revamp. Great guest rooms, facilities and amenities, but most importantly, the staff. Everyone was super friendly, especially Christian. He made our trip a memorable one! Visit him at the concierge desk for unique local insights & personal assistance!

See you guys soon!",5,2018,11,30
21,An oasis in Barcelona,"We had the most amazing time at this hotel. Not only the design and installations are beautiful, they make you feel spoiled! The spa is fantastic! 
Special thanks to the staff, they are marvellous. Breakfast is outstanding!!! We will definitely come back! :)",5,2018,11,24
21,50TH Birthday Celebration!,"This was THE perfect hotel. It had all the right amenities. Perfectly central location and the Staff was exceptional. Very knowledgeable and generous with their services and treats! My mom, sisters and I had the the best time and were reliving and retelling it all yesterday over Thanksgiving dinner! We are truly grateful for the wonderful experience at SOFIA.",5,2018,11,23
21,Can do better ,The facility is good but the quality of the welcome staff drop from visit to visit . Reconsidering going there . There is really an issue with the night shift ! Disappointing really with such an amazing hotel . ,3,2018,11,17
21,One night stay - fantastic,"Stayed here for one night. Arrived at noon and had some great tapas in the restaurant. Staff is very friendly, room is impeccable and had all the stuff you could want. Got a free room service with a snack and a drink. Yeah, my best stay in Barcelona so far!",5,2018,11,17
21,Amazing Experience,"I stayed in the Sofia Hotel for about a week for a Business Conference & event we did there. 
The Hotel's location is a big advantage as its right at the edge of the city. Very easy to access from the Airport and you can literally walk to the main sites of Barcelona. 

The Check in was amazing with very friendly staff and always willing to help. 

The rooms and the facilities in the hotel were a big surprise as it easily compares to some of the very best hotels I have stayed in all over the world. 
Latest amenities, very thoughtful features in the rooms and really comfortable beds with a choice of pillows you can ask for based on what works best for you. 

The Spa, Gym and the Swimming pools are well maintained, clean and offer some really amazing facilities.

The breakfast menu is vast and you can try some choicest Iberian Ham with fresh eggs and a variety of bread and cheese. Even when I stayed longer than a week I never got bored with their variety and customisable menu. 
If you are in Barcelona, this is the place to stay.",5,2018,11,14
21,Best hotel weve ever stayed in!,"The Sofia hotel is something special, and a place we cannot recommend highly enough.

From the moment we stepped into the lobby we knew we were in for an amazing stay. The check in staff were friendly and polite, and made check in easy, along with the hotel Porter who showed us to and around the rooms.

The rooms were exceptional. Clean, modern, well equipped and most of all comfortable. We both agreed it was probably the best night's sleep we've had in months! We even took note of the brand of pillows from the concierge!

Who speaking of, were probably the highlight of the hotel. We had the pleasure of speaking and dealing with Matthieu and Luis, both of whom were professional, incredibly friendly and both very knowledgeable of Barcelona. We got some great recommendations of things to do during the day, and Luis' restaurant recommendations for evening meals were divine; which ended up being some of the best tapas we've ever eaten (see separate reviews).

The hotel breakfast was tasty and extensive, with loads of pastries, cold and cooked foods, fruit, cereals and juices.

The spa is also worth a mention and was incredibly peaceful and serene. We went down at 9.30am and had the entire place to ourselves. The various sauna, steam, ice, salt rooms and plunge pools were all great, and the pool itself was huge and impressive! Also worth noting is the hotel gym, which was incredibly well equipped with more than enough good quality cardio machines, free weights and weight machines to get a decent workout in while you're staying at the hotel!

Without doubt the best hotel we've stayed in, and one we will be recommending to all our friends and family. Genuinely don't have a bad word to say about the Sofia, we will definitely be back! ",5,2018,11,13
21,Extremely noisy,"Reading the other reviews, I wouldn’t believe that I stayed in the same hotel!

Yes, it is an ok looking modern hotel, but if you are looking for a peaceful stay, look elsewhere: this hotel has an incredibly bad sound proofing.

My room was at the corner of Placa de Piux XXIII, so there was constant noise of traffic AND an amateur soccer field right in front of the window, where they played football post midnight even on some of the weekdays. So much fun to listen to cheering and referee whistles late at night...

I actually had even asked for a quieter room upon check in, when they initially put me on a lowest floor, street facing room. Apparently this ”next to the busiest street, next to a 24h soccer field” room a few floors higher was the quietest available. Didn’t want to go back to the front desk again, as they seemed to consider the ask a nuisance in the first place, but resorted to earplugs, which is not ok for a fivestar hotel.

For reference, I travel 1/3 of days every year and this one had the biggest noise issues I have experienced in this category of hotels.",2,2018,11,12
21,Business hotel has been Reopened and modernization,"This hotels is a modern gem in the business district approx 20 to 30 minutes (and euro) by taxi from the airport. Everything is done through touch screens that work very well. The good sized sphere rooms have a large island with a sphere that contains a mirror above washing basins on one side and the TV on the other.
Breakfast was a feast setup in three areas, bakery and cold meats, juices and cereal, and hot dishes. Excellent choices all very fresh and tasty - I tried them all.",5,2018,11,10
21,Lovely modern hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights while attending a conference. The location can be problematic traffic wise if you need to get to the city centre during rush hour. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are decorated to a 5 star standard. The blackout blinds work a treat. The breakfast is fantastic and the bar served by very friendly staff although the bar could do with some decent tonic water to go with the pricey gin. The hotel was at full occupancy when I stayed and I was unfortunately in a room right next to the lifts which did mean some additional noise. Also the water system sounded like it had some air locks as it gurgled away from about 5am when people started to use their washroom. These issues may have been isolated to my room.

Overall a great hotel,",4,2018,11,08
21,One of the best hotel experiences,"I was at Hotel Sofia for a work trip and was impressed with the design, features, facilities, and most importantly - how many friendly staff always available literally everywhere to offer their assistance...never seen anything like it! Kudos to the management of this hotel for building such a great team of people. The beds/ pillows were amazing and comfortable, the library cafe was so cozy....for sure I would stay here again next time if I could choose anywhere in Barcelona!",5,2018,11,07
21,Friendly yet Professional,"I combined a few days holiday with a business conference. Both were excellent experiences. The holiday was relaxing (despite a lot of sightseeing) and the conference was excellent, in part due to the excellent conference facilities at the hotel.

The bedroom was large and the beds very comfortable. Bedroom and bathroom were clean and tidy.

The hotel is located close to the Metro station which makes it very convenient for sightseeing. The metro is easy to use (buy a single ticket that allows you 10 journeys) and is very efficient.",4,2018,11,03
21,one of the best in Barcelona,"stayed there for a full week. the hotel is a truly 5 stars hotel. service is superb. the restaurants are very nice and service is great. breakfast at Impar has everything you can think of. iberico, cheese, eggs, etc. great espresso!!!!",5,2018,10,29
21,State of the art 5 hotels,"Modern decoration, brand new facilities, good bars and restaurantes, excellent services, totally domoticed rooms, with very confortable beds and pillows. High class products in the bathrooms. Good location very close to hop on hop off bus stop",5,2018,10,28
21,Luxurious business trip,"Fantastic hotel - rooms have been designed with comfort in mind, and the staff are lovely. Great breakfast selection and generally just a joy to wander around the hotel. Particularly loved the small lights which guide you to the toilet in the night. ",5,2018,10,27
21,Good But Not Great,"The hotel itself is beautiful and the location great. I booked here primarily for the proximity to the Camp Nou. Overall, the staff was extremely professional and accommodating as well. Having said that, there were a few issues with the room. My particular unit had no sound proofing whatsoever. I could here the cleaning staff outside my door each and every morning. Whether it was the opening and closing of doors or listening to them communicate with one another. It was simply unsatisfactory to hear this each day. The other two things was a lack of lighting in the shower and no place to hang your towels except in the shower itself. Oddly enough there was a flood light in the shower but the cleaning staff told me it wasn’t meant to turn on and had no switch to do so either. The hardware to hang the towels were located in the shower only to soak them while showering. Now I don’t know if each and every room at the hotel exhibit the same issues, but nonetheless I’d probably have reservations about booking at this hotel in the future. I mean considering that they are rated as a 5-Star hotel, the finer details in terms of room functionality and overall noise levels should not be an issue.",3,2018,10,27
21,a very nice four day trip to visit Barcelona,"come in and feel very well - from the begining to the end … every day/Hours/Minute
friendly and helpful people .. a Special THANKS to Christian (Concierge) he support us every day with precious tips.
we are coming back....",5,2018,10,26
21,Lovely hotel,"I had coffee at the hotel cafe after a nice lunch at their restaurant Impar. Love the books and library motif. The lobby was also modern and very chic, will stay here in the future if the occasion arises.",5,2018,10,15
21,Business & Pleasure,"Beautifully designed hotel with great attention to detail, very friendly and efficient staff - happy to help and keen to please. Lovely finishing touches from house keeping although the basin designs were style over practicality! Business conference well organised and able to switch our stay to an extended ‘couples-only’ break. Lovely trip to the spa (glad we took advantage of our ‘freebie’ - maybe 2 free trips for stays of 5+ days?)
Breakfast menu varied, bar menu fresh and tasty - didn’t eat in the main restaurant. 
Happy to recommend, would be more than happy to return.",5,2018,10,14
21,Fabulous- best sleep ever,"Our room was so comfortable and so beautiful and so expansive—  The bathroom was as big as the bedroom with a huge comfortable soaker tub separate grand shower stall windows with black out curtains and attention to every detail large vanity lighted makeup mirror area 
Excellent service the staff was very friendly and very helpful",5,2018,10,10
21,Over priced ,Nice design and stylish / looks a bit like W - very modern. But very overpriced - next door Hilton is way cheaper or fairmont in other side better hotel with similar pricing. And at that price I rather stay at the beach ,3,2018,10,05
21,Brilliant modern hotel,"Brilliant hotel near Barcelona football ground. Very modern, with an excellent choice of restaurants of bars. Would highly recommend. Close to metro and bus links. Slightly out of the way but not an issue. Great friendly staff.",5,2018,09,30
21,Elegant and sophisticated ,"Stayed at the Sofia for 7 days, and the newly renovated hotel blows you away from the second you walk into the lobby. The room is high tech but functional, with the likes of motion sensor night lights, and the bed and pillows among the best I’ve ever slept in. The shower is just perfect! Staff are extremely helpful and courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure guests are comfortable. Perfect for leisure or business. ",5,2018,09,29
21,Very good,"Stayed here on a business trip. 4 days. Excellent hotel in terms of service, room size and especially the washroom- large and almost luxurious.

Had some coffee in 1MPAR- decent restaurant. Had breakfast thrice- decent breakfast though they could improve the choice of cereals. Fruit selection is excellent.

The only reason they don't get a 5 star is because the hotel doesn't give adapters for plug points. Instead they expect you to buy one which is available in the room- which usually would be fine but this one was for 120€. It's a really sophisticated one and the receptionist tried her best to sell it to me- but honestly spending that much because I had forgotten mine- just didn't seem right.

Excellently located. Near the underground, 1 minute from a Starbucks and small bars.

Will stay again.",4,2018,09,27
21,Brilliant hotel with top rated staff,"Thsi is a brilliant hotel, one of the best 5 stars I've seen, not the best location in town, but it has all the other bits, good size rooms with modern facilities, very clean and the staff very helpful, nice and polite. 
Very nice restaurant with good breakfast and good food served all day. 
This is my place to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2018,09,22
21,WHAT A WONDERFUL GET AWAY!,"I was invited here to celebrate my daughter's 50th birthday. Some other friends, considered as family, also met us there. The staff, accommodations, amenities, services, location and the beauty of the hotel were all stellar. I was able to recover from the journey that started on Monday morning and ended in Barcelona on Tuesday morning in a totally darkened room. They offered/allowed an early check in to accomplish this. The room was extra modern and very comfortable. The multiple and varied food and entertainment venues were wonderful; and the SPA and pool facilities were simply top notch. This hotel was a real winner and perfect vacation destination.There were issues with the final billing that could be avoided in the future by having a final bill delivered the night before checkout.",5,2018,09,19
21,Great hotel near Camp Nou,"Very nice hotel, great loby, great spa. A bit far from the city centre but enough taxi’s around. Breakfast is very good as well. Room was spacius fully equiped but with a shower only (no bath). A real 5* hotel.",5,2018,09,19
21,Amazed!,"We were still awed by the sleek and modern design of the hotel, despite that we have been to so many top tier hotels. The use of white marbles, cement-looking walls and gold/dark bronze told me that the hotel was designed very recently. The room had this smart design that some lights turn on when you move close. I like the central control which includes the curtains. The tv would turn on itself at random times to welcome you if you are not scared by that!

We had a very warm welcome. The check-in staff was super friendly and talkative. Even cleaning ladies for making up the rooms were very smiley. The staff was very smart. The clean-up ladies showed up immediately after we removed the ‘do not disturb’ tag. The doormen checked for any forgotten items after we got off the cab. Staff showed up and offered help when we got lost looking for the spa. 

We were very delighted to find that we had free access to the spa for once, where we could enjoy the whirlpool, sauna and steam rooms. Of course they had this modern and sleek design as well. It was a much needed relaxing boost to the hectic shedule in Barcelona. 

The interior design of the hotel and the service could have landed it with a 5-point rating yet we were disturbed by some minor issues. 
Cleanliness- I got 6 bug bites and my husband got one on our first night. The issue was gone after they changed the bed sheets second night onwards. 
Admin issues- We were told when we checked in that we had free breakfast and only to find that we were charged for one of the few breakfasts we had when we checked out. The hotel didn’t charge us at that point though they have to improve the management of bookings. Our key cards were not functional on our last night as well. 
Amenities- very basic amenities like toothbrush/paste are not provided unless you call to ask yet they give you so many sewing kits and hairbands. Weird?
Shower room- the door couldn’t be closed and we had to tuck in a towel to prevent it from springing back open. So weird.",4,2018,09,11
21,Excellent,"As a person that travels in the world , I’m visiting in many hotels ...
Sofia hotel in Barcelona was very good to me ,
I’m happy with my choice ,
At the welcome I can see the professional team that work there and give the best service,
The rooms are very beautiful and technological,
The spa area was perfect, 
 I can continue like that for al the facilities that this hotel offer , for me Sofia hotel make my Barcelona vacation perfect with the score of 10 ...
So thank you Sofia hotel and the best worker team",5,2018,09,06
21,Amazing stay!!,"We had an extraordinary stay at Sofia! Rooms were spacious, clean, and had everything you’d possibly need. The pool & the gym were amazing we used them daily. All the staff were so noce & helpful specially Chris at the concierge he made our trip 10 times easier planned everything with us, we love this guy!! We will be back soon for sure!! Highly recommended hotel!!",5,2018,09,04
21,Barcelona  Vacation,"The staff was wonderful and hotel was great.  I will stay at the SOFIA on my next visit to Barcelona.  The hotel has a great marketing opportunity with Dan Brown's new book, Origin since the hotel is mentioned in the book several times.",5,2018,09,04
21,Lovely hotel,"We stayed one night back in May on our way through from Madrid.  A lovely hotel, very friendly and helpful staff and would definitely stay again.  Only thing is the rooms are not suitable for anyone other than partners/couples as the showers are see through to the room.  We had to vacate the room each time my friend or I wanted to shower which is quite crazy.",4,2018,08,31
21,Perfect Stay,"Sofia is one of the most lovely hotels I have been to. It is very modern, clean and luxurious and yet still has a distinctive style. It stands out from the rest of the hotels that I saw during my stay in Barcelona. 

You get one free entry to the spa during your stay and it was really nice. It had a very calm atmosphere and there was an options of rooms to go in, such as the: sauna, ice room, salt room etc. The outdoor pool was also peaceful and it was easy to find loungers. 

Staff were very polite and helpful; our room was cleaned twice a day. I recommend once if you decide to stay at Sofia that you order breakfast to your room as it lovely as the staff go above and beyond in creating an extravagant breakfast. 

To anyone stuck on where to stay in Barcelona, this hotel is definitely worth the consideration. ",5,2018,08,26
21,Awesome concierge and overall service. ,"We did not have a plan leaving SA, only that we wanted the holiday to be special. Christian was our concierge, he was professional, knowledgeable, patient and helped us put together a plan that exceeded our expectations. He helped us navigate our way around using the metro, which made the trip more memorable. 5/5 for service. Hard act to follow! Will definitely stay there in future and would highly recommend to family and friends. ",5,2018,08,26
21,Wow,"Hotel Sofia is pure luxury. Decor is amazing, spotlessly clean, a high end retro style....just beautiful. We stayed in a sphere room. Could not fault it...it has everything you need. Complimentary wine and snacks replenished every day, air conditioned, gadgets galore and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was very tasty with a huge selection. Staff are amazing. Nothing is too much trouble.. they attend to your every need with a smile. The bar man on Friday night (can't remember his name) researched and made a cocktail for me that he had never heard of. Easy access to Barcelona via the metro and lots of great restaurants etc in the local area. 
Go to Hotel Sofia. It's fabulous. ",5,2018,07,30
21,4 nights in luxury,Lovely 5 Star hotel. Excellent staff and the rooms are to die for. Made sure I spent the hot afternoons recovering by the pool. Great automatic motion sensor triggered lighting in the room at floor level for that late night/early morning visit to the bathroom. ,5,2018,07,25
21,An amazing first visit to Barcelona,This hotel was exceptional. We loved everything about it. Amazing staff and food made our stay superb. It has been through fully renovated with a splendid mixture of comfort and use of technology to ease your stay. Amazing!,5,2018,07,16
21,Great hotel.,"Fantastic hotel.Great rooms. Above all impeccable service. The staff are caring and competent.We salute and pay special tribute to Mr Carlos at the front desk.
He goes beyond the call of duty.
We were a family of 12 including young kids and they took care of our every need.",5,2018,07,10
21,Best hotel in Barcelona,"The service is so incredible, the rooms so comfortable, makes it 1000% worth being slightly off the main drag (which in fact very accessible via underground station Maria Christina), perfect for families, groups, or even couples. The staff made this one of our best family holiday weekends ever (and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world). Nothing is too much, everything is done with a smile, and the staff are there to serve and make sure you just have a wonderful stay. Well done Hotel Sofia!!!!!!",5,2018,07,10
21,Barcelona stay,"Newly refurbished hotel (Feb 2018). Great food and facilities especially the spa and gym. Although the gym is small its much better than in the majority of hotels. Rooms excellent, beds really comfortable, quiet at night. Its a bit of a way out of the centre but easy by taxi",4,2018,06,28
21,Superb hotel with stunning rooms,"What a great hotel.

Excellent welcome on arrival, shown to room which 8s very modern and stylish.  All the staff were well trained and helpful whatever the request.  Great advice on restaurants from the concierge and extended check out time due to later flight time.

Highly recommended and I will be returning.",5,2018,06,27
21,Simply amazing,"This hotel is great value for your money. Hardware and interior are brand new and high tech. Staff is simply amazing and very friendly.

The hotel has been rebuilt quite recently and they did a good job. There are a lot of facilities to use on the property, including a spa. Entry is free, but only for once per stay. That was kind of a bummer because the alternative is the pool which closes pretty early.

The rooms are very modern with very comfortable beds. The design is quite fashionable with an eye for detail. The TV for example is integrated in the wall and consealed behind a black window. Only once you turn it on, does it become visible. Only downside about the room is the fact that our shower leaked a little bit that made the wooden frame mouldy. Besides that it was perfect.

Our breakfast was included in the room, and probably one of the best I've ever had. The hotel has a restaurant, that looked great but we haven't been there. On the other hand we did order room service and although a little bit expensive it had a lot of flavour and was simply amazing. 

Overal, we had a fantastic stay and we got great value for our money. Only advise I can give to the management is: the mini bar is too expensive. If you would bring the prices down we probably would have drank the champagne. As a result the glasses aren't used very often so they were very dusty. Perhaps you'd like to swap them once in a while. ",5,2018,06,25
21,Best Stay and Service,"I stayed in SOFIA hotel last week for our annual corporate conference. I can go on and on about the hotel beautiful and practical design, the great food and the outstanding service. It is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Good location, very comfortable and welcoming and the staff is extremely helpful, which I did not expect in a European hotel. 
Thank you to Luis, Mathieu and Christian, the fantastic concierge team of the hotel for all your help with every single request, even before I made it.
A special thank you to David from A/V, who seemed to be in 3 rooms at any given time to make sure that we do not have any issues during the conference.
I highly recommend this hotel for any business trip, conference or personal vacation.",5,2018,06,25
21,Business Stay and cocktail,"I have stayed at this hotel for a night to attend a cocktail there.  The service at the front desk was excellent.  They spoke in English fluently and they were helpful and friendly.  As breakfast opens at 7 am and I had to leave hotel at 6.30 am the day after, they offered me to have a lunch box prepared at check out.  And this was done with fresh orange juice, bottle of water, fruit, sandwiches and croissant.  The room was perfect and lightning modern and easy to turn off from the bed.  Bed was comfortable with a huge duvet.  Everything was perfect",5,2018,06,25
21,Still love Sofia !!!,"Don't be put off by the lack of a royal title in the newly updated Sofia hotel - This hotel is fit for Royalty and the rest of us !! This is my first visit back to this hotel since the renovations has occurred - I have stayed here a few times in the past and loved this hotel for its charm and indeed the amazing employees that work there. This visit I was greeted by the new  updated and upgrade lobby .. no longer is the old outdated reception area now we are greeted with a very updated architectural delight  - almost like visiting an exhibit at an art gallery - very bright and welcoming .. The Sofia out does every hotel I have stayed in while in Barcelona with the employees they hire from the door to the front desk and beyond - Everyone was so welcoming and the service was second to none. They all go that extra little bit to make sure they make you happy. ABSOLUTELY amazing. 

The rooms in the hotel are now all upgraded - this is evident as soon as you step out of the elevator on your floor. ""Ultra modern cozy"" is the best way to describe the halls and rooms. The beds are comfortable with an assortment of pillows for everybody's taste. The room lay out (in my opinion) was perfect - everything was perfect. The TV has a good selection of TV channels in various languages to cater for all guests. My other favorite part of the room was the shower - WOW !!! The shower unit in my room was amazing - perhaps the best shower unit I have experienced. 

I had breakfast included - great selection of foods for every tastes - several different food stations to cater for every global taste bud ! I had dinner in the hotel one night - food was amazing. If I could fault anything in the hotel I would have to say the restaurant was a little unorganized and I heard guests around me complain about slow service - I was in no rush so it didn't bother me at that time but I could see how people could get upset. 

Finally location of the hotel is great  - safe and a few minutes walk to the metro which is the gateway to everywhere you need to get to in Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends. I for sure will be returning. Thank you SOFIA for a great stay. ",5,2018,06,22
21,Fantastic - WISH I was staying longer!,"The WISH floors and Team at the Sofia are absolutely exceptional! I am in the hotel business and know quality when I see and experience it, and everything about the Sofia and especially the WISH experience was perfect. I look forward to returning and was sad to leave...",5,2018,06,17

We also had a breakfast at the hotel that was as good as any I've ever had!",5,2018,06,11
21,Excellent Hotel,"Really good hotel with great service and beautiful rooms. Hotel is located about 15-20 minutes to the very center of the city but very easely accessible by metro as there is a metro station 200m next to the hotel. Taxi/cab will take 10 minutes and cost 10 EUR. Beautiful rooms with all amenities you can wish for and even more. Service is excellent. Very nice food as well (breakfast). The bar is lovely with an outside terrace, nicely furnished. I can only recommend this hotel. We had a very pleasent stay and would love to come back.",5,2018,06,10

21,"Modern , smart , friendly , next to football stadium","This is a first visit to this renovated , modern hotel right next to the iconic Barcelona football stadium ( my limo deliver called the church of the city as all show up there on Sunday ). Welcome at the door ( no real bell captain , looks like the front desk work as a team to cover the entrance too). , check in friendly , and  pointed me to dinner at BE SO ( a superb and surprise restaurent in the hotel ). My room is modern and fresh looking , the bedroom and bathroom are equally sizable and comfortable . Internet is free.  The exercise room and pool is very nice too , I am glad I have a chance to enjoy. . The only drawback is this is a bit away from town . The conference however is at the football stadium which is just minutes away  and 30 minute to airport ( with min traffic )  A pleasant experience ",4,2018,06,02
21,Fabulous staff and great room,"The hotel staff is amazing at every level. From the front desk to housekeeping to bartenders and wait staff all were polite, professional and helpful. The facility itself is also top notch.Room was spacious, great bed, nice TV with good international offerings, ample and nice toiletries and blackout curtains that actually provide full darkness. Breakfast buffet was plentiful, fresh and delicious. Location was good and easy access to Barcelona public transportation, the airport, Camp Nou and local shops and eateries. Will be back!",5,2018,06,01
21,Major disappointment ,Just rocked up at the hotel. One of the main reasons for booking this hotel was the heavily promoted pool area. Brusquely told at reception it's not open and will open maybe in a few weeks. Now we are stuck in an out of the way conference hotel we wouldn't otherwise have booked. ,1,2018,05,25
21,"Beware: If you stay at Sofia, you will not want to stay at any other hotel in BCN - ever again","It is the first time in my life that a hotel actually picked up the phone and called me for confirmation after I completed my booking online. This was the first impression.
Then you meet the staff right after you get off the cab. They are super nice. You will notice from the first moment how special they make you feel.
The rooms are also very nice -not the classic 5-star luxury, so prepare to be amazed by the modern details.
What else? Ok, I tried spa and it got a 10/10 from me. Trust me, I live in Dubai and we are quite spoiled there, so when I give such a good feedback, you should listen :)
Breakfast is also good. I’m not a fan of continental breakfast in general, but the quality is good so that’s another plus.
In summary... so far so good. 
I’m checking out tomorrow and I so don’t want to. 
I’m definitely coming back to Sofia.
Thanks team for such an amazing experience!",5,2018,05,23
21,Truly 5 stars in every sense of the word.,"I am a frequent traveler and have been to most parts of the world and  have stayed in all sorts of hotels. But truly, Hotel Sofia is one of the best I have stayed in so far. Impressive  hotel facilities and amenities- clean and modern. Great great great staff- from the welcoming butlers, to receptionists , concierge and housekeepers- all very welcoming and attentive to your needs. Fabulous breakfast spread as well. Staying in the same hotel with the professional tennis players playing for the Barcelona Open is such a bonus too. :)  Im very impressed in fact Im stll due to check out today, but couldnt  wait to write a fitting review.  I would definitely stay here again if I had to go back to Barcelona!",5,2018,04,29
21,Best conference venue so far!,"newly refurbished, possibly the best hotel for a conference, perfect facilities, the staff were second to none, from the doorman to the manager. Pool not yet finished but there is a brilliant spa and a disco.  Everything is automated from calling the lift to closing the curtains in your room. Great location, 30 mins to the beach by car.  The lady in charge of events - Ana and her colleague were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend this for business or pleasure.",5,2018,04,23
21,March Barcelona visit 2018,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Princess Sofia Hotel, Barcelona celebrating a special birthday. We cannot thank the hotel staff enough for their support during our visit, nothing was too much trouble. We used the hotel concierge for their local knowledge and because of that we experienced some amazing restaurants, the food was superb. Our room was a junior suite which was excellent and very spacious. This is a very good hotel and wouldn't hesitate it recommending it to others or a return visit. ",5,2018,04,16
21,A Fantastic Hotel,"The new Sofia hotel is beautiful but what makes it special is the staff, everyone is so sincerely welcoming and attentive. The new decor is modern and sleek. The food is delicious. The service is outstanding. It is a true gem in Barcelona. If you are planning a trip there, this is where to stay. I will be back.",5,2018,04,12
21,So much personality with comfort,"Everything is really well done, with quality and a style of its own. I see this hotel fit for single business traveller, but also for a couple looking for a romantic gateway. What they offer is a cocktail of innovations around all the basic utilities and facilities you would expect from an hotel of this category, and its truly mind blowing. The restaurants & Bars are pure, original and sufficient. Must try the fine-dining ""Be So"". 
Personal plus: The largest hotel shower room i have ever seen.",5,2018,04,05
21,Amazing staff,"We stayed at the Sofia over Easter (29th March 18 to 2nd April 18).

We cannot fault the service at the hotel at all. They were all very attentive and extremely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and any request was dealt with efficiently, effectively and with enthusiasm. 

The hotel is a little out of the centre but there are always taxis outside the hotel, good local bus and tram stops and we enjoyed the 45 min walk into the centre.

The rooms are modern, clean and have good facilities. The cafe and restaurants on site are also excellent. We ate in the cafe one day and had lunch in the main hotel too. The food was fresh and good. The travel host Christian helped us organise our trips and was very helpful. In fact all of the team manning the concierge were great.

We would stay here again as we can not emphasise how great the staff were.  

",5,2018,04,03
21,Fantastic hospitality,"Stayed at SOFIA March 17-18. Chose this hotel as it looked like the nicest hotel close to the Nou Camp football stadium. I stayed with my 9 year old boy.

Service is fantastic at this hotel. From the front desk, to bell boy, to concierge. Friendly, responsive, attentive and extremely proactive. 

Prior to our arrival, I had several email exchanges with concierge about restaurant bookings, and they were very helpful with suggestions. 

We arrived early at mid morning on our day of check in without prior notice, and they were able to put us into a room within a few minutes which was very nice. 

Christian at concierge absolutely made my son’s day by giving him a few autographed pictures of football players from FC Barcelona, the team went to watch play that weekend. Such wonderfully attentive and personal service.

Room was very nicely decorated. Hotel’s about a month old thus there was a particular previously unidentified issue in our room - the cold water wasn’t working in the shower so we had super hot water. It was late on Saturday evening but they managed to fix it in about 30 mins even at that time of the night.

Buffet breakfast was excellent. 

Aesthetic of the hotel is great. Very contemporary and current, yet warm.

I’ve stayed in many hotels over the years and I continue to travel extensively. This hotel had lots of little unexpected touches which made it a fantastically memorable experience. 

I would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,03,25
21,Great hotel! ,"This hotel was great! I attended a conference and from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, I knew this was a top notch hotel. Everyone was friendly and the hotel was very clean. 

I loved the natura bisse amenities, the comfortable bed and most importantly all the power USB outlets for your devices! I would’ve needed 4 converters :) 

The coffee shop was my favorite though. 

",5,2018,03,23
21,"Great modern style, amazing people!","I stayed in Hotel Sofia and the place is beautiful it has been just renovated and still smells like new its in a good location and the staff is absolutely amazing they make you feel like home, I lost my voice on the second day and Christian from Concierge offer me tea to be send to my room, the staff from Front office was always supper helpful Jose Manuel and Carlos, and from breakfast Emilio and Felix totally make you feel like home, absolutely enjoy my stay and will totally recommend is definitely the place to be in Barcelona, we went to a football game with is walking distance, the hotel has a bar/club really cool to check out called Zuu and you have walking distance good restaurants like Santa Clara Restaurant and some shops :)",5,2018,03,21
21,Beautiful and beyond expectations,"They really nailed this renovation. Rooms are remarkable, showers fantastic, blackout curtains great. Everything push button in the room. Can't say enough. This place is it. 
Luxury at finest. I will stay here again.",5,2018,03,18
21,Cultish ,"Hotel’s best asset is not the great location or the magnificent and trendsetter architecture. It’s best asset is the staff and their probably unsurpassed service I’ve ever experienced in Barcelona or Europe. 

Thank you for such an amazing experience 

",5,2018,03,17
21,Best rooms in Barcelona! ,"I was there mamy times before the reconstruction. But now ot is the best hotel to be. The room infinity was so nice. Big screen (never had a TV screen bigger than that!) comfy bed and roomy bathroom (marvelous shower). I can only recommend this place
",5,2018,03,15
21,Beautiful hotel NOT family friendly,"We visited for a total of 3 nights (happy we didnt book any longer) wanting to stay in a comfortable hotel close to Camp Nou. Staff were nice but we never felt welcome. Hotel is not for families! We had to book an extra room just for my 6 year old at a discounted price which Im grateful for since we never used! We've visited many places and 1 room with a Queen bed has been enough for a family of 3. They do have a policy so we had to book the extra room. Hotel is AMAZING, latest technology, beautiful room, friendly staff and 5min walking distance from Camp Nou (reason we stayed here) I will never stay here again though. ",4,2018,03,15
21,Simply Elegant ,"I stayed in the Junior suite room, and it was more than enough . And the food on property is deserves a Michelin star. Simply amazing overall experience. Staff has incredible attention to detail. Definitely will return and recommend ",5,2018,03,13
21,Best Part of My MWC 2018 Experience,"I travel globally and rarely write hotel reviews but the Sofia Barcelona exceeded my expectations. Without traffic, it's approximately 20 minutes from the airport to the hotel. Check in was easy and the rooms are modern, elegant, clean, tech forward and the bed is divine.Every single staff member is well trained, helpful and very thoughtful. One evening after a long day and the harshest weather, I trudged into the lobby exhausted and famished. Isaac, one of the very attentive lobby staff asked me if I needed anything and I told him I needed warm clothes and a good meal. He brought me into the dining room where the wait staff helped me compose my own entree and they told me to go upstairs and change and they'd have everything ready for me. When I returned a short 10 minutes later, they had my table set up, a glass of wine was immediately poured for me and they brought my scrumptious meal. I went from cold and hungry to happy, happy, happy. Every night the turn down service usually included a little chocolate treat but on my 4th night, a little box of macarons were waiting for me. The location is also close to a couple of restaurants and shopping malls so I was able to pick up a bottle of wine and some snacks. MWC is usually a long week for those who attend. For me this year, the best part was returning to the Sofia Barcelona and being greeted by the same friendly doorman every time. The staff are absolutely the best!",5,2018,03,02
21,Up to Date Hotel for MWC,"Stayed here for MWC 2018.  Great up to date rooms and fantastic service from the front desk, concierge and other staff.  The downstairs bar is very nice with live music and there is a really nice coffee shop.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were closer to downtown, but the metro is an 8 minute walk.",4,2018,02,28
21,An amazing Hotel in Barcelona ,"Sofia Hotel has a special style with beautiful rooms.It is situated in a business district in Barcelona max 30 min away from airport. The staff is very friendly and helpful everywhere-reception, restaurant, entrance, spa etc. The food in all hotel restaurants is very good .If you are a footbal fan Camp Nou-FC Barcelona's Stadium is 5 min walking from the Hotel.The metro Maria Cristina Station is 3 min away. It is a very good hotel if you are coming in Barcelona with business and you need comfort and luxury for you and your partners. ",5,2018,02,27
21,"Clean, new and comfortable ","Staied there for 4 days in a biz trip, very clean and modern, totally renewed with supportive staff, nice buffet breakfast, ambianced bar, movie should be purchased to watch on tv, 
Recommend to biz travellers and families for sure.",5,2018,02,27
21,Hyper-modern yet very comfortable,"Sofia is not in the city center, so if you are looking to be within walking distance of the main attractions, this hotel is not for you. However, if you don't mind being a short taxi ride away, and yet want to have a very luxurious experience, you should consider staying here. The styling is very chic and yet the rooms are very comfortable. I would stay here again.",4,2018,02,05
21,Excellant,5 star hotel in every way. The staff are perfect. The rooms are as good as you can get. Yes its just had a refit but has everything you need in your room. I have stayed three times. I travel to Barcelona at least twice a month. This would be my first choice hotel.,5,2018,02,02
21,A beautiful hotel with amazing attentive staff,I visited Sofia for work commitments and from the second we arrived until the moment we left I was given 5 start treatment. The complimentary bathrobes and the attention to details in our rooms gave our stay that extra special touch. I will be visiting here for pleasure next time in in Barcelona. I cannot recommend enough! ,5,2018,01,08
21,Business trip,"I was there during Mobile word congress in Barcelona, the hotel rooms is clean and have a good space for relaxing, prices also normal compare with the same class, having car park is one of the advantages of the hotel as well. a small shops inside the hotel also can be useful for getting and buying gifts.",5,2017,11,08
21,Amazing time we spent,"We had beautiful days in the city. So many attractions including parks musium etc, it was little cold which is not unexpected but not that bad .
Local people are friendly and helpful.
This was our first visit to sofia , we stayed in a Hilton hotel which was a good one",4,2017,11,06
21,Excellent,"We stumbled upon this hotel due to cancellation of our flight it was provided for us but I must say the service, the room and the staff was amazing. Highly recommended and definitely will be coming here.",5,2017,10,27
21,Conference Hotel Barcelona ,"Very well appointed hotel that is impressive as you walk through the front door, outside is nothing to write home about and let's it down. 

Room comfortable and fitted with mod cons like electric blinds and motion sensors on the floor that come on in the dark as you step out of the bed to gently guide you on your way. 

The shower is to die for with a big rain shower and hose with unending water. Complimentary toiletries are fragrant and of a reasonable quality.

Breakfast is a delight with plenty of choice and beautifully laid out by the chef's manning the stations.

Approx 10mins walk from the football ground so if that's your thing then stay here.

My own negatives are 1. that my bedroom window did not drown out the noise for the streets below, only 4 floors up. It seemed to be single glazed so voices and cars below were evident as were the building works. This will annoy alot of people as it wasn't tranquil lying in bed. 
2. My air conditioning didn't work on the first night so the handyman was called at 02:30 so chalk up a sleepless night.

Would I stay here again.. Yes. Could it be improved... Yes, sort out the soundproofing. Hence a 4* overall from me. ",4,2017,10,25
21,Excellent hotel,"Very impressive hotel, staff not really the best, but here i had the best Grilled Octopus of my life. I even returned to the hotel in a next trip due to this amazing dish...hahaha....comfortable enough and good service at the restaurant. Will be back to eat but not to stay at the hotel",5,2017,10,24
21,Nothing is too much trouble.,"Due to a strike by Air traffic control in France we had our flight cancelled and were put in the Sofia for 2 nights. I just want to thanks the hotel staff for the way they handled a sudden influx of 120 extra guests at 11pm.They were so polite, friendly, helpful and just made a bad experience a lot easier to cope with. The hotel is lovely , just been refurbished. We had breakfast and dinner included and the waiting staff were lovely too, especially Victor who was really helpful. So thank you again Hotel Sofia .",5,2017,10,21
21,Work in Orogress,"The hotel is going through a complete refit. What has been completed is so far very good.

The hotel staff are as near perfect as you can get. Always a smile, Nothing is too much trouble and the really want to please. The manager Jordi Maestro is as good as it gets. He notices everything, and hand picked the staff.
Only one restaurant is open at the moment, the food was was very good indeed, Spanish with a twist. The other restaurant will be open shortly.
I visit Barcelona often and I will certainly stay at the Sofia.",4,2017,10,11
21,Best hotel!!,"My experience in Sofia hotel was amazing, the design of the hotel is gorgeous the stuff really made me happy, they are really helpful and specifically a guy called Christian from the concierge, he helped me in everything I really appreciate his help and all the stuff help.
Finally, when i go to Barcelona again defiantly i will choose to stay in Sofia hotel.",5,2017,10,01
21,"Great hotel, ask for the concierge Luis for recommendations","Very helpful staff, the concierge Luis was specially helpful and generous with his time to recommend great spots to visit and dine at in Barcelona. Recently renovated hotel, rooms were nice and comfortable with a choice of pillows.",5,2017,09,28
21,Excellent,"I have stayed at this hotel twice and each visit was excellent. The hotel is very well located, allowing for relatively quick access to other parts of the city via public transport. The hotel is as the name says, Grand, in every respect. At its price point it delivers exceptional value, the rooms are spacious, the lobby well appointed and luxurious and the excellent meals are served in a pleasant environment. Highly Recommended.",5,2017,09,25
21,Great boutique hotel with very nice staff,"We stayed in this hotel for a few days while in Barcelona and very much enjoyed the experience. The hotel has just been re-opened after a long refit and it combines a really cool designer/boutique layout with a convenient location near various landmarks. But the thing that really made our stay remarkable was the staff, who literally went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The rooms are not huge but are very tastefully decorated. The bar is a really co place with a great collection of good whiskeys. All in all a real gem!",5,2017,09,21
21,my fist opinion trip to Barcelona,"Hotel is excellent. Room very big and bright,clean. Bed comfortable. breakfast not expensive, but tasty. Staff only polite and will fulfill all your wishes. this hotel justified my expectation. I recommended",5,2017,09,20
21,6 stars,"If I could give Sofia and her staff more than five stars I would. From the minute we walked thru the front door we have been treated like royalty. 

The staff is so helpful and is so eager to be of great service. The Concierge is extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of what to do. And if they do not know something, then they will find out and get right back to you.

When things weren't absolutely perfect, the staff strived to make it so. To me, that is excellence. Nothing in this life can be perfect all the time. 

Also, the neighborhood in this area is so clean and safe. And the staff knows all the best places to eat. If you want to know where to eat, just ask Luis! If you want football tickets or to rent a moto, just ask Christian. But be sure you have your international drivers license!

We stayed in the Harmony room. And it truly feels that way! We are so happy that we stayed here!

21,Barcelona's grand dame is back in style!,"I had the pleasure of staying at the newly renovated Sofia for 3 nights on a business trip to Barcelona. It had been years and I was blown away by the new design and the exceptional service ! Quite frankly, the new look of Sofia - formerly the gran hotel princesa sofia - is stunning, with some asian accents, everything in the guestroom is very high tech, the rooms are practical and spacious, perfect for a business trip but I can see myself going back for a week end getaway. The meeting space was always one the best in the city but it the new colors make it more contemporary. 
I loved the bar ! such a gorgeous space and architecture. They lost nothing of the old charm of the hotel but it almost looks like a new build !",5,2017,09,19
21,Tolles Hotel,"Wir haben sehr viele Extrawünsche bereits vor, aber auch während unserer Anreise gehabt. Allen wurde auf hohem Niveau entsprochen. Die Zimmer sind wunderschön, sowie der Aufenthaltsraum im 18. Stock und das Restaurant im 19. Mitarbeiter sind alle sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. ",5,2024,08,29
21,Very disappointing. and poor service in the restaurant. Except for the pool. Very attentive staff.,"The overall hotel fine although considering that it is a 5* should be better
For example, 12' delay for Check-out.
Very poor service and information in restaurants. Especially the Sofia-bar in the lobby.  (They had no letter in Spanish. Only in English.) They also did not have it in physique, only in tablet and to top off 4 dishes that we ordered, two did not have them. Please. Very unhappy.  
At first thing did not work the phone in the room coa very important to me, since I was traveling with my husband in a wheelchair.
And final detail, I was told that if I wanted to go to the indoor pool I had to pay 35 euros. I indicated that I had not been informed and it did not seem correct. But nothing... they missed each other, period.
And the carpeted hallway on the 15th floor I advise you change it. 
I have been to enough 5* hotels and the truth has been very disappointing.",3,2024,08,19
21,Delighted,"Very happy, everything as expected, we will definitely repeat, will be our reference hotel in Barcelona.",5,2024,08,14

21,Wonderful.,"The hotel is a real 5 GL. The overall staff spectacular...particularly Henar, the ironing station companions and some veteran waiters....The variety and great quality... gymnasium very well....the only one but they have the staff at breakfast poorly sized. Expensive Peruvian restaurant but Buenos Aires is worth every euro you pay. We'll be back!!!",5,2024,08,12
21,They can't handle,"With two exceptions, a team facing the public VERY Pro, not kind, rather dry, not empathetic and making many mistakes constantly. It is NOT a team for a luxury hotel",1,2024,08,12
21,Wonderful.,"Hotel within walking distance of the metro. The staff of each department is extremely kind and always ready to meet every need.
Special thanks to Clara del FO, who welcomed us with great kindness and illustrated perfectly all the services of the hotel.
Many compliments also to the Guest Experience, extraordinary figure and available 24/24 for every need.",5,2024,07,02
21,A magnificent hotel in an ideal urban setting,"An excellent option as a ""base of operations"" to visit Barcelona for whatever reason. The hotel allows you to enjoy all the services of a first class establishment, to rest and recover after an intense day in the city.",5,2024,07,01
21,Stay in Barcelona,"First-rate new installations.
Excellent service. Very good breakfast. Ideal for both business and holiday travel as it has a good pool and spa area. The Peruvian restaurant on the rooftop is an idea to enjoy a good dining experience overlooking the city.",5,2024,06,29
21,Luxury within reach in the center of Barcelona.,It was a great and uplifting experience to be able to enjoy a weekend at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona. A high-end establishment with renovated and very luxurious facilities. A great success!,5,2024,06,18
21,Are we kidding!?,"It is unacceptable in a 5 star hotel to have to wait 30 minutes to check in. Neither the television nor the telephone in the room were working. We reported the fault at 7pm and at 11pm we were offered a room change. For an entire afternoon the elevators were out of order forcing us to use the service ones. Furthermore, at check out, showing disappointment at the once again exhausting wait, we were rudely told ""leave the key here"". Should this be the service offered by a Grand Hyatt?",1,2024,06,16
21,"Good hotel, Bad experience","Vacation with my pregnant wife and my 1-year-old daughter. We arrived around 10:00 p.m. so we left our things in the room and went down to eat. Everything looked good, modern and clean. 

Around 11:00 p.m. we went up to shower and go to sleep. We organized our things, and around 11:30 p.m. I went to the shower. Within 10 seconds of turning it on, it began to fill and flood the bathroom. I called immediately to request a room change and they answered yes and that they would quickly upload the keys to me. Unfortunately, it took almost 15 minutes for the doorman to come to the room to ask me if I had problems. I asked him again for the change, which took him another 10 minutes to return and just after 00:30 my family could rest.

Although it may be an isolated incident, the housekeeping supervision is clearly very bad, because for a shower to be clogged in 10 seconds of showering makes one think that it had not been cleaned in a long time. 

The rest of the stay was fine. I recommend the PREMIUM room category because it has a better distribution of the same m2 as the other categories. The tapas bar in the lobby was good, and the Peruvian restaurant on the rooftop is EXCELLENT.",3,2024,06,14

21,A good option for a city trip!,"In my opinion, this hotel is the perfect location for business overnight stays, VIP football fans and those seeking sporty peace and quiet.

A fun fact: the elevators are second to none. Here, only individual floors are accessed using a tablet, so you only have to wait a few seconds for the elevator. Magic!

Unfortunately, there are also 1-2 shortcomings:

- the service at the outstanding rooftop bar/restaurant is catastrophic. This urgently needs to be changed

- we unfortunately had problems with the charges because we extended our stay by one night and were charged twice.

Nevertheless, the hotel is a good option for a trip to this beautiful city.",4,2024,05,10
21,The Grand Hyatt Barcelona leaves nothing to be desired,"From the very warm welcome at reception to the room service, everything was top notch.

21,Highly recommended,"We spent one night at the hotel with my partner.

Highly recommended experience.

Feeling of tranquility, it didn't seem like there were so many people staying at the hotel.

Good rest in a discreet and exclusive atmosphere.

21,Exceeded expectations,"I am a Hyayy member, but if I weren't, I would still say that this hotel does what it proposes in every way. And when reality is better than what is proposed, then the objective is achieved. It is not in the center, yes, but in some points it is much better than others of similar quality/price.",5,2023,11,24
21,Best hotel I've been to.,"I think it is one of the most beautiful and well-kept hotels I have ever been to.

The room was super clean and spacious. Very quiet and comfortable.

The quality of the restaurant is very good and the breakfast is spectacular. Lots of variety and quality.

The staff were very attentive, friendly, helpful and willing to help if they noticed that you needed something.

Very very very good. And the home automation details in the room are very cool.",5,2023,11,13
21,Short vacation with family,"The hotel is in a quiet location, with excellent connections to the subway, buses and trams, or to the airport. You can retreat from the pulsating city, but are still close to the sights thanks to the good transport links. The hotel staff are very accommodating. There are restaurants and cafes in the immediate vicinity.",4,2023,11,13

21,Almost flawless!,"Very nice, stylish hotel, a bit further away from the city center. But you can get where you want to go quickly by taxi, Uber or metro. 
The hotel is beautifully designed, my highlight in the room was the shower. Huge and simply beautiful. Unfortunately, you can see in some corners of the bathroom that great design doesn't always last long, e.g. fittings. It just doesn't fit with the rest. The roof top bar is brilliant, as is the view. The bar downstairs also has a decent selection, even if the prices are a bit high in some places. 70 EUR for a Macallan Rare Cask is a statement. The pool is nice, although rather small. The breakfast room is very nice, especially as there are plenty of seats outside. The breakfast itself leaves absolutely nothing to be desired: from Egg Benedict, Ensamada to Pata Negra, everything is there and the cappuccino comes from the portafilter and is brought to the table... The service otherwise is also good. Actually almost better than Casa Fuster, if it weren't for the location and the building doesn't look impressive from above.",5,2023,10,13
21,Very pleasant stay,"The place is very nice and luxurious, it has all the amenities, it is well located, the service is very good and the place is very clean. My trip was for business but I would definitely stay there again.",5,2023,10,02
21,Disappointment,Dirty rooms. Floor not clean and hair in the bathroom sink. Checkin very slow and with absurd things. At checkout they don't give me the receipt because 'the system doesn't work'. I request the receipt via email two days later and no one responds. I organized an event there with over 300 managers. We'll never do it there again.,1,2023,09,24

21,"Perfect stay, marred by a manager you don't expect to find in a 5-star hotel","Very clean rooms and incredible pool staff, always looking out for us at all times. Unfortunately, on the penultimate day of the stay (which coincided with our anniversary) we had to cancel the reserved massages because the therapist was not available. Although we are aware that this can happen, the management in this regard was terrible. We received a call that we didn't have time to answer and no email (when one was supposed to have been sent to us).

At around 3:00 in the afternoon we found a note in the room telling us what had happened (two hours after the first massage).
We went down to the spa to talk to the receptionist and as compensation for the inconvenience caused, she told us that she would give us access to the spa for free.

When they did not offer us any other type of solution (since when you reserve a massage, access to the spa area is free) I asked to speak to a manager. Seeing that the manager was late, the receptionist told me that I could wait for him at the pool (where I was at that time).

After an hour of waiting I decided to go back down to talk to her and this time wait for the manager in person. A few minutes later Erika (the manager) arrived with a totally defensive attitude, saying that they had tried to contact us in every possible way, which is a lie because we had only one missed call, no email and no other type of contact and It's good that she couldn't do more because these were things that happened and that's it. I explained to her that it was my anniversary and that it was a really important day to which she responded that it was good that there were no other options since they did not have another therapist available. I explained to him that it had been handled very poorly because they had notified us very late. We had a massage at five and another at seven so our entire afternoon was already closed to do this and even if we decided to go somewhere else, we wouldn't have time to get changed again and then go to dinner for our anniversary dinner which seemed like give it the same. I asked her why she hadn't gone down to the pool, taking into account that I had been waiting for her for an hour, to which she replied that no one had called her. We both looked at the receptionist who remained silent and it was quite clear that I had never told her so I was waiting at the pool for nothing. Instead of saying something to the receptionist or apologizing to me, she decided to turn to me and tell me that it was good that they had called her now and that she was here now, so that was what counted. She became very defensive when I asked her name and said that she didn't understand why when she was there she tried to give me all the possible solutions, when in reality she had not offered any valid solution, she even told me that if we wanted, she would offer us some. drinks for our ''birthday'' which was even worse, because it was very clear that he was not listening to anything he said

21,Ein Desaster Eric der Supervisor ist eine Katastrophe,"Ich habe ein upgrade in der App gekauft und dies wurde mir am Check In verwehrt. Mir wurde offensichtlich vor der Nase mein Zimmer unter den Rezeptionisten weggenommen.
Dann habe ich ein Upgrade Angebot auf eine nächst höhere Kategorie gekauft. Es stellte sich heraus, dass das Zimmer im System seit mehreren Tagen mit einem defekt des Heißwassersystems hinterlegt ist.
Trotzdessen wurde mor das Zimmer zugewiesen.
Eric der Supervisor im Dienst wollte einfach nicht den Manager on Duty rufen und hat sich als Chef over All ausgegeben.
Es gab von ihm am nächsten Morgen nicht einmal ein guten Morgen.
Stattdessen Attitude en mass!!!
Das Frühstück ist ein desaster mit dem unfreundlichsten Mitarbeitern auf Erden!!!!
Bitte Eric kündigen!!!!",1,2023,06,25
21,Trampa para turistas,"El hotel tiene unas instalaciones muy bonitas, pero eso es todo. El personal es muy poco profesional, se equivoca con las categorías de las habitaciones (reservé una Junior Suite y me dieron una inferior), te dicen que tiene cargadores para el coche eléctrico pero luego no funciona ninguno y te dicen que ya se han quejado varios clientes pero nadie hace nada para arreglarlo, te confirman el early checking pero cuando llegas la habitación no está lista y te la acaban dando pasada la hora normal de acceso, etc. La verdad, creo que solo sobreviven porque Barcelona está llena de turistas que aguantan lo que les den. Dudo que ningún profesional que se quede repita la experiencia. Muy poco profesionales y a años luz del servicio habitual de un 5 estrellas.",1,2023,06,20
21,Top hotel,"Das Sofia Hotel ist ein absolutes Juwel unter den Hotels! Von Anfang bis Ende war mein Aufenthalt dort fantastisch. Das Hotel hat eine wunderbare Lage inmitten der Stadt und ist leicht zu erreichen. Der Empfang war herzlich und das Personal äußerst freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Zimmer, in dem ich übernachtet habe, war geräumig, sauber und komfortabel. Die Einrichtung war stilvoll und modern, und ich fühlte mich sofort wie zu Hause.

Das Highlight war definitiv das Essen. Das hoteleigene Restaurant bot eine breite Auswahl an köstlichen Gerichten, die frisch zubereitet wurden. Jede Mahlzeit war ein wahrer Gaumenschmaus. Das Frühstücksbuffet war reichhaltig und vielfältig, mit frischem Obst, Backwaren, Eierspeisen und vielem mehr. Es war ein perfekter Start in den Tag.

Die Servicequalität im Sofia Hotel war ausgezeichnet. Das Personal war stets hilfsbereit und gab wertvolle Empfehlungen für Sehenswürdigkeiten und Aktivitäten in der Umgebung. Sie sorgten dafür, dass mein Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich war.

Die Annehmlichkeiten des Hotels waren ebenfalls bemerkenswert. Es gab einen Fitnessraum, in dem ich trainieren konnte, sowie ein Spa, in dem ich mich entspannen konnte. Das WLAN funktionierte einwandfrei.

Ich kann das Sofia Hotel uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen. Es ist ein perfektes Ziel für Geschäfts- und Freizeitreisende gleichermaßen. Die Kombination aus exzellentem Service, komfortablen Zimmern und erstklassiger Küche macht es zu einer erstklassigen Wahl. Ich freue mich bereits auf meinen nächsten Aufenthalt dort.",5,2023,06,12
21,Insgesamt sehr zufrieden,"Top Lage, sehr schönes Zimmer, alles picobello sauber. Meiner Meinung nach könnten die Angestellten zuvorkommender sein.

21,Il peggior 5* provato in tutta la vita!,"È un vero peccato che l’albergo sia gestito tanto male, perché la struttura di per sé sarebbe bella, ma ha bisogno di rivedere totalmente il personale. Iniziamo dal check-in: al bancone ragazza giovanissima, probabilmente stagista, che dopo circa mezz’ora di smanettamenti sul pc finalmente mi consegna la chiave. Arrivo in camera e la chiave non funziona. Quindi torno giù al check in, aspetto altra mezz’ora e finalmente riesco ad entrare in camera. La pulizia avrebbe bisogno di una grossa revisione: vedrete dalle foto che la console è piena di ditate, i bicchieri  sono sporchissimi. Entro in doccia e i contenitori sono senza sapone. La camera è molto buia e soprattutto estremamente  rumorosa: sembra di dormire sulla strada nonostante sia un piano alto. I canali tv si vedono solo parzialmente e il Wi-Fi non funziona. Mandano un tecnico che mi tratta pure male e non risolve nulla. Mancano cuffia per capelli, spazzolino, insomma tutto ciò che in genere è presente in un 5 stelle.
La mattina dopo la colazione e’ l’altra nota dolente: lo spazio è molto bello, ma alla stazione del caldo c’è solo una persona. Dopo 20 minuti in fila, come alla mensa, ottengo il mio uovo benedicte, che con le mani la signora sposta dalla piastra (quindi uovo fritto) su dell’insalata. Insomma, passata la voglia di mangiarlo. 
Per finire non fatevi ingannare dalla foto della spa: anche i clienti dell’hotel devono pagare 30 euro per entrare.",1,2023,01,03
21,Precioso lugar,"Después de la reforma y cambio de imagen , es totalmente necesario que hagan lo mismo con el
personal y también la parte gastronómica . Recomiendo ir a cualquiera de los restaurantes que están por los alrededores ",3,2022,12,30
21,Un hotel al que volvería,"Hotel muy bonito y moderno, desayuno muy completo y variado, habitaciones amplias y cómodas. Muy limpio, el gimnasio con maquinaria actual y el spa increíble igual que los tratamientos.
Muy buena ubicación cerca del tranvía, bus y metro.  2 Centros comerciales y El corte ingles a unos 15 min andando y a 5 min del Camp Nou.
El personal muy atento y muy educado.
Volvería a repetir sin duda.
Negativo:
Las almohadas un poco finas y la ventana de la habitación muy sucia por la parte exterior del cristal.
Hacer obras en el spa en horario al público.",4,2022,12,26

El concierge súper amable nos ayudó en todo. Check in y check out un poco lentos. El servicio de housekeeping muy bueno en limpieza pero el día que nos íbamos vinieron a tocar la puerta y nos despertaron cuando era día de check out! El SPA no me pareció gran cosa, pagar 30 euros para entrar en octubre cuando las piletas están cerradas no vale mucho la pena. Encima con horario reducido de 15 a 21h. El jacuzzi está medio mal diseñado ya que las camas para disfrutar de las burbujas están mal diseñadas y el motor hace un ruido bárbaro. El sauna hamman es un peligro, con cables a la vista, el aire caliente se va para arriba caen gotas de condensación que te queman y las piernas y pies se te enfrían! 
La ubicación del hotel es buena tenes tramways y subtes cerca para moverte y al centro son 10 min

Tuvo que dejar el hospital para ir a solicitar la devolución y respuesta del hotel...aquí somos muchos y la persona que les atendió ayer hoy no está!!!!

Die eigene Parkgarage ist nur leider sehr überteuert (35€) aber es gibt auch reichlich Parkmöglichkeiten auf der Straße oder auch in 500m günstigere Parkgaragen. Frühstück ist auch sehr teuer aber in 100m gibt es eine Bäckerei (Santa Gloria) hier kann man reichlich Preisangenehm Essen. Das Pool ist leider sehr klein für das Hotel und leider immer überfüllt.

21,Ensaimada de Mallorca,"Como mallorquín que soy me he sentido dolido por un cartel en el buffet del desayuno que rezaba ENSAIMADA CATALÁN SUGAR PASTRY… el cartel lo dice todo, pero deben rectificarlo porque no es CATALÁN NI ES AZÚCAR Y TAMPOCO ES UNA PASTA O PASTEL.  Cuando la butifarra con secas sea madrileña y el Rioja Catalán los mallorquines nos plantearemos si la ENSAIMADA PUEDA SER CATALANA",3,2022,06,10

21,La cabina de la ducha SIN luz,"La reforma completa del hotel se ha hecho sin contemplar luz en la cabina de la ducha. Parece insólito pero es real, además de absurdo. Las habitaciones superiores son pequeñas y tienen otras carencias pero la principal es que tienes que adivinar cuál es el gel o champú, o colocarlos previamente de una manera especial para no errar. Increíble!!!",1,2022,04,17
21,"Tolles Zimmer, schlechte Fenster","Insgesamt war mein Aufenthalt leider nur mittelmäßig. Das tolle Zimmer und das sehr freundliche Personal oder die Dachterrasse konnten nicht über ein entscheidenen Schwachpunkt hinwegsehen lassen: Mein Zimmer in Richtung zur vielbefahrenen ""Diagonal"".

Penso che un servizzio 5 stelle non puo permettersi un modus operandi da hotel all inclusive con uova occhio di bue già precotte.",4,2019,09,10
21,Con encanto,"Estuve alojada con mi pareja un par de días, a la llegada los botones nos atendieron enseguida nos acompañaron a la recepción y nos ofrecieron agua. El personal muy atento y amable, sobretodo con educación. La habitación moderna, limpia y con muchos detalles como por ejemplo el alumbrado. Muy confortable. Estupenda ubicación. La comida de la piscina muy correcta. Como negativo diría que hay pocas hamacas en la piscina, el servicio de philosofia muy escaso y había una parte del hotel (spa) y restaurante que estaban cerrados por vacaciones y reformas. A mí parecer no está bien que un hotel 5 estrellas gran lujo tenga todos estos servicios indisponibles. Por lo demás todo genial. Volveremos seguro en invierno! ",5,2019,09,08
21,Me esperaba más,"La verdad es que me esperaba mucho más: las personas de seguridad de la puerta de entrada no parecieron muy amables, me tocó una habitación que aunque con una decoración preciosa era minúscula y con muy poco espacio para trabajar (y había avisado con anterioridad de que iba a ello, a escribir mi próximo libro) además de que se pusieron de obras en el piso de arriba durante un par de horas y todos los espacios del hotel estaban con el aire acondicionado a tope y hacía un frío terrible todo el día. La atención al cliente estuvo muy bien aunque no me explicaron cómo funcionaba el moderno ascensor ni dónde era el desayuno ni los diferentes espacios que tiene el hotel. Tampoco de que el spa estaba medio cerrado. No lo sentí nada acogedor de espacio (la room assistance fue genial si) y un hotel así no se puede permitir tener una política medioambiental en la que aún tengan botellas de plástico pequeñas en las habitaciones, el spa y el gimnasio.",3,2019,08,31
21,Ottimo hotel di lusso,"Ottimo hotel di lusso con splendida piscina e spa e personale molto attento al cliente. Sicuramente una delle migliori strutture in città, completamente rinnovata con gusto ed opulenza. Comodo servizio valet parking. ",5,2019,08,24
21,Hochklassiges 5 Sterne Hotel,"Sehr stylische Zimmer mit sehr modernen Bedienkonzept der Lichtanlage, Verdunkelung und  des großenSmart Tv.Zimmergröße ausreichend.
Endlich mal ein Zimmer mit einfacher Bedienung der Beleuchtung. Wunderbar ist der nachts indirekt beleuchte Weg zur Toilette.
Dusche sehr groß, aber nicht blickdicht (wen es stört....).Modernster, riesiger Smart TV. Lautlose zugfreie und effektive Klimaanlage. Wir hatten selten so ein perfekt ausgestattetes Zimmer mit so einem herausragenden Funktionalität.
Schöne kleine und grüne Poolanlage mit Liegen und Louge Aeras, wo man eigentlich immer ein Plätzchen findet. Direkt an der Via Diagonal, heißt ,Bus ,Taxi und Metro alles nah bei.
Das Personal ist, wie man es eigentlich in so einem Haus erwarten darf, äußerst zuvorkommend und freundlich.
Wir haben uns in dem Sofia äußerst wohlgefühlt, war aufgrund der vielen stylischen und technischen Aspekte mal was ganz Besonderes für uns.",5,2019,08,10
21,Luxus und Ruhe,"Positiv aufgefallen ist: 
Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend und bemüht. Schon beim Ankommen kümmerte man sich sofort um uns, brachte unser Gepäck aufs Zimmer, servierte Wasser und bot uns einen Stadtplan an. Auch während des restlichen Aufenthalts waren die Mitarbeiter immer da wenn man etwas brauchte und trotzdem kaum zu bemerken. 
Das Zimmer war groß, sehr schön eingerichtet und das Bett war unglaublich weich und kuschelig. Angefangen von den großen Kissen über die exklusive Bettwäsche und die große weiche Matratze. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Hotels fühlte sich das Bett überhaupt nicht kalt sondern sehr einladend an. Es gab einen guten Föhn, einen großen Fernseher und eine automatische Beleuchtung am Boden wenn man nachts raus musste um auf die Toilette zu gehen.
Der Pool war klein aber fein. Es war ruhig und es gab mehrere Plätzchen wo man etwas für sich sein konnte. Die Cocktails dort waren mit 12€ eher teuer aber dafür auch ausgesprochen gut.
Das Frühstück ist sehr exklusiv. Es gibt frisch aufgeschnittene Wurst-, Schinken- und Käsesorten, Rührei, Baked Beans, guten Kaffee, frisch aufgeschnittenes Obst, Müsli, Joghurt, frisch gepresste Säfte, ... Das Personal bringt Kaffee/Tee/Saft sogar zum Tisch und kümmert sich von selbst um Nachschub wenn die Gläser leer sind. Außerdem waren im Frühstücksraum kaum andere Gäste und es war daher sehr schön ruhig.

Einziger (kleiner) Kritikpunkt:
In diesem Hotel wich die Praktikabilität um dem luxuriösen Design Platz zu machen. Es war zwar alles sehr exklusiv schön aber auch teils unpraktisch. So gab es zum Beispiel wenige Handtuchhalter und kaum Ablageflächen im Badezimmer. Die offene Dusche erlaubte nicht nur den Gästen bequemes Duschen, sondern auch dem Wasser sich im ganzen Raum zu verteilen. 

Fazit: sehr exklusiv und ruhig, genau das richtige zum Entspannen, man fühlte sich dort sehr willkommen und gut umsorgt.",5,2019,08,08

El servicio y atención de todo el personal sumado a la calidad de las instalaciones, los cuartos y la relación precio/valor, hacen del Hotel Sofia una súper opción para llegar a Barcelona y ser atendido de forma especial.

21,Nuevo Sofia más excelente aún,"Perfecto el servicio y las instalaciones. Era un hotel muy agradable pero, ahora, en la nueva etapa, ha sumado modernidad y nivel Hyatt conservando sus esencias. La ubicación es ideal y la calidad de los acabados le hacen muy acogedor. Del precio no puedo opinar por ser los días del MWC, pero, las tarifas normales parecen muy razonables.",5,2019,03,03

21,Gran hotel,"Recomiendo totalmente este hotel, estuve allí con mi familia y estuvimos en la planta 17 la verdad q todo fenomenal.

21,Bar Besuch ,"Das Hotel wurde wundervoll renoviert 
Die Bar ist optisch ein Traum 
Mein Signatur Cocktail war allerdings enttäuschend primitiv, ein Sektglas mit zwei Schnäpsen und Sekt aufgefüllt, darin noch zwei Amarena-Kirschen 😱geschmacklich katastrophal
Personal freundlich. ",4,2019,02,04
21,Viaje de negocios,"Muy buena atención por parte de los empleados del hotel atentos e implicados en cualquier petición Limpieza y comodidad de las habitaciones. Quizás escasos en productos de limpieza (cepillo/pasta de dientes, afeitado...) que aunque disponibles, había que solicitarlosRecordad que al estar cerca del campo del Barcelona, se generan muchos atascos en los momentos de entrada y salida de los partidosValoración general: para repetir",5,2019,02,03
21,Convención de trabajo,"Hotel de lujo con un Spa muy bonito, agradable y maravillosos masajes. Desayuno fantástico y buen bar de copas. La habitación era muy cómoda. Almohadas estupendas y amenities de primera. A la altura de lo que se espera de él. ",5,2019,02,02
21,Muy buen servicio,"Habitaciones muy confortables, por poner una pega entre los amenities eché de menos kit dental y de afeitado, la atención de todo el personal fue excelente, el buffet del desayuno muy bueno con servicio de cocina. El spa está muy bien ",5,2019,02,02
21,Decepción,"Soy cliente habitual de este hotel, incluso antes de la nueva dirección. En mi última visita me decepcionaron dos aspectos que son intolerables, en mi opinión, en un establecimiento de 5 estrellas que cobra 300 € por noche. Anuncian unos canales de televisión con deportes, futbol (movistar plus) de libre acceso al cliente. Avisados de que no funcionaban no fueron capaces de solucionarlo ni de ofrecer una alternativa.
El segundo incidente es con el restaurante. Personado para la cena me dicen que como era un día que había partido de futbol en el Nou Camp solo tenían un menú buffet y que si quería un servicio a la carta debía acudir al room service. En el restaurante solo había una mesa y 10 personas, entre cocina y sala, cruzados de brazos. Increible!!!. En todo caso deberían avisar de esta anomalía al hacer la reserva. Lo dicho, algo inaudito en un hotel que pretende ser de lujo. No sé si volveré. Espero, como mínimo unas disculpas de la dirección.",3,2019,01,16

21,Máxima seguridad ,"Nada más llegar al Hotel Mari Claire me atendió perfectamente. El Hotel es de lujo, la habitación muy amplia y el baño con todo tipo de servicios. El desayuno de Emilio me atendió de maravilla, Hay diferentes arias para cada tipo de alimentación o bebidas, todo de primera calidad. El gimnasio es moderno amplio y luminoso, la lástima es que no pude disfrutar del spa.
Miguel me mostró alguna de las estancias de las últimas plantas, dignas de ver y más aún de disfrutar. Toda una experiencia que hay que vivir en el Hotel Sofía de Barcelona
Coincidiendo con mi estancia llegaron el presidente del gobierno y de l Generalitat y el Hotel estaba acordonado por policía.

21,Un 5 estrellas bien merecido,"Decir que este hotel es espectacular se queda corto. Nuestra visita a Barcelona se vio coronada con una de las mejores experiencias que hemos vivido, y todo gracias a la estancia en este fantástico hotel, cuya atención a los detalles, en el más amplio sentido, fue más que sobresaliente. Las modernas habitaciones están diseñadas con un gusto exquisito y cuentan con un sistema domótico que permite tener un control prácticamente total desde casi cualquier punto. No tuvimos oportunidad de conocer el spa ni los restaurantes, así como tampoco la piscina, pero en una siguiente ocasión seguro lo haremos. Nuestro especial agradecimiento a Christian Brasero, el concierge que nos recibió y estuvo pendiente de nosotros de principio a fin, su excelente trato y disposición fue siempre de mucha ayuda.

21,Extraordinario con un matiz,"Excelente hotel. Tras la reforma ha quedado sensacional. El spa es pequeño, pero acogedor y cómodo. El personal, de primera.

La misma noche del día que deje la habitación, me llegó un cargo de 1 botella de champagne y 1 redbull que no había tomado, tuve que llamar a preguntar a qué se debía ese cargo ya que simplemente te lo cobran y no te dicen nada.

A las horas después de llamar por teléfono me devolvieron el dinero pero me parece un error MUY GRAVE cobrarte por algo que no es tuyo y si lo haces llamar antes de hacer el cargo y no al revés.

El hotel estaba bien si no fuera por eso.",2,2018,07,23
21,Soggiorno gradevole,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo lussuoso hotel ubicato in una bella zona nei pressi del mitico stadio del Barcellona raggiungibile a piedi. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, stanze ampie e confortevoli, pulizia e gentilezza del personale. Abbiamo fruito anche della piscina coperta e di quella all’aperto con idromassaggio. Il centro è comodamente raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici (fermate nelle adiacenze) oppure in taxi (prezzi onesti e medio-bassi). Ottima colazione in grado di soddisfare tutte le esigenze. Non abbiamo usufruito del ristorante avendo optato per i tanti locali presenti in centro.",4,2018,07,21

Da wir wussten das wir vorab über das Hotel einen Fahrer gebucht welcher uns freundlich und pünktlich erwartete. Auch haben wir vorab schon einmal unseren roomservice bestellt welcher excaxt 5min nach unserer Anreise von einem freundlichen Kellner serviert wurde.
Mein absolutes Highlight jedoch war das Frühstück. Wir als gesund Essende Personen hatten so eine tolle Auswahl von smoothies über a la Carte eierspeisen. Durch Emilio unseren Kellner wurde das nur noch abgerundet.  Wir arbeiten selber seid vielen Jahren in der Hotellerie und werden gerne noch einmal ins Sofia kommen als Kollegen und Gäste.",5,2018,07,14

21,Gutes Business Hotel,"Waren für eine Woche dienstlich in diesem Hotel. Service und Personal waren sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. 
Nur drei Punkte/Sterne aus folgenden Gründen:  Bei unserer Ankunft (nach 17 Uhr) waren einige Zimmer noch nicht vorbereitet. Das Essen war akzeptabel ohne hervorzustechen. Bin deshalb kritischer, da dieses Hotel eher hochpreisig ist und da bin ich auch anspruchsvoller, was Service und Ablauf betrifft. Ich möchte aber nochmals die Freundlichkeit des Personals hervorheben. Ich komme gerne wieder. ",3,2018,06,06
21,Excelente hotel en Barcelona,"No suelo dormir en hoteles en Bcn ya que vivo allí, aunque de forma temporal estoy viviendo fuera. Teníamos una cena en bcn y busqué un hotel para pasar la noche. Me llamó la atención la reforma del princesa Sofía y eché una ojeada a su web. Su modernidad y lo que vi que ofrecía me hizo decidirme a pesar que no es céntrico. Está bien comunicado por eso. 

Llegamos con coche directamente al parking. De allí puedes entrar directamente al hall y tiene punto de carga para vehículos eléctricos. Yo aproveché para cargar mi coche.

Nos ofrecieron un free upgrade, pero como nos gustó más el diseño de la sphere nos quedamos con ella, pero todo un detalle. Además nos dieron una botella de cava como cortesía.

En recepción muy amables y te hacen sentir muy cuidado. He estado en muchos hoteles por trabajo y este trato es de los mejores que recuerdo. Nos mostraron las dos habitaciones, nos explicaron todos los detalles de la habitación (súper modernas).

Comimos en el restaurante impar, calidad precio muy bien. Es donde dan el desayuno, excelente también.

Visitamos el spa y el gym, muy buenos y con buena atención del personal.

A media tarde pasan para arreglar la habitación para la noche y te reponen todo lo que has gastado.

Me han dado ganas de buscar otra excusa para volver, no sé si el be so, zuu o un masaje en el spa, pero espero volver otro día.

Agradecer a todo el personal la gran estancia que hemos tenido.

21,Muy bien,"Excelente ubicacion, fantastico trato por parte del personal sobre todo un saludo a recepcion muy amable y servicial. Habitaciones muy lujosas, ultra modernas con sistema de iluminacion muy sencillo de utilizar. Por el lado negativo fuimos mal atendidos en el bar filosofia por una chica que parecia de lo mas despistada. y una bolsa de patatilla que valga 8 euros en el minibar tambien me parece un poco abusivo. Por lo demas todo limpio excelente comida en los restaurantes y volveremos seguro pronto!",4,2018,05,09
21,Excelente!!!,"Todo está bien con este hotel 5 estrellas que en la avenida diagonal, está cerca a la estación María Cristina y a cinco minutos caminando del Camp Nou...

21,"Exzellent, besser gehts nicht!","Hotel ist in Summe echt toll, großzügige Lobby, stets genügend und kompetentes Personal, umfangreiches und vielfältiges Frühstücksbuffett mit super Qualität, noble high Tech Zimmer mit super Dusche u fancy zurückhaltender Beleuchtung unterhalb des Nachtkästchens und im WC für nächtliche Toilettengang, sobald die Füße aus dem Bett gestreckt werden.

Doch bemerkenswert und ganz außergewöhnlich war die besonders engagierte besorgte Hilfe der beiden diensthabenden Conciergen CRISTIAN und LUIS, da mein Koffer fast 3 Tage später als ich ankam. Regelmäßiges Nachfragen bei Groundforce und Fluglinie, Herausfinden des Prozederes einer Beschwerde bzw einer finanziellen Abgeltung, laufende Updates und Info an mich, als das Gepäck ankam. Die beiden waren so bemüht, stets geduldig, super freundlich und professionell, als wäre es deren eigener Koffer gewesen.
Ich habe mich mit jedem Anliegen perfekt aufgehoben gefühlt.

acogedors.

El espectáculo no te deja indiferente, el personal superatento y la comida riquísima!

21,Experiencia 100% recomendable en ZUU Barcelona!,"Gran espectáculo con grandes artistas. Gastronomía original y de calidad con un servicio excelente. La decoración está cuidada al detalle en cada rincón. Si estás buscando una noche diferente con buena música y espectáculo, este es tu sitio!",5,2018,03,17
21,Rundherum gut,"Zur brandneuen Überarbeitung dieses Hotels kann man nur gratulieren. Die Räume im 18. Stock (der sog. ""Wish"" Etage) sind atemberaubend und riesig - egal ob Great Wish oder Best Wish. So lässt sich auch ein längerer Barcelona-Aufenthalt auf das Beste aushalten. Das Design ist modern, aber sehr zweckmäßig; man kann sich wirklich wohlfühlen - das trifft insbesondere für die herrlich komfortablen Betten zu. Das Personal war superfreundlich und ausgesprochen bemüht, die noch verbliebenen Kinderkrankheiten auszumerzen. (Die smarten Schalter am Bett funktionierten nicht und die Klimaanlage wollte ihren eigenen Willen durchsetzen, statt die eingegebenen Temperaturen einzuregeln.) Das Frühstücksbüffet war vielfältig und alles war ausgesprochen lecker. Auf alle Fälle eine sehr gute Wahl für einen Besuch in Barcelona, auch weil die nahegelegene Metro-Station leichte Exkursionen in die Stadt erlaubt.",5,2018,02,08
21,Noche mágica en ZUU,"Quedamos con unos amigos para disfrutar de una noche espectacular en el ZUU!!!
Comenzando por el Restaurante como espacio, gratamente nos ha sorprendido un espacio meticulosamente cuidado en los detalles de interiorismo.
Las pantallas que hay, te transportan a otra galaxia.
El trato es muy cuidado y de nivel.
La comida está muy buena y muy bien servida.
El show es muy divertido y entretenido: combina cabaret con café concert.... Te sientes en Paris o en Londres en años pasados.
Los baños son alucinantes!!! 
Todo es una super experiencia que no hay que dejar de vivirla, hay que verlo y comer todo!!!

Muy recomendado!!!!!!!!!!",5,2018,01,13

Nos sorprendió a todos. Hicimos un menú degustación exquisito, acompañado de un gran espectáculo de música y baile. Recomendable 100%. Buen lugar para ir con amigos y cenas de empresa. Los camareros muy agradables y atentos. Casi nunca doy la opinión de un restaurante o hotel si no me ha dejado impresionado. Hasta pronto...seguro que volveremos!",5,2018,01,09
21,Perfekte Adresse für Designliebhaber,"Das frisch renovierte Sofia kann ich jedem wärmstens empfehlen. Das Personal ist an jeder einzelnen Stelle überaus freundlich, herzlich und motiviert, auf eine natürliche Art und Weise. Design und Materialqualität sind über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Wir haben - aus beruflichem Interesse - 4 weitere Hotels der gleichen Kategorie besichtigt. Mein Fazit: Wir haben die beste Wahl getroffen. Restaurant, Rezeption, Café Filosofia, Spaa, Bar, alles hervorragend. Ein grosses Lob an den Designer, der die Räume gestaltete. (Empfehle den Besuch seines Konzeptstores mit Café in der Stadt.) Nicht zuletzt möchte ich das hervorragende Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis erwähnen.  Im Vorfeld hatten wir uns Gedanken gemacht, ob wir durch den laufenden Umbau gestört würden. Hiervon haben wir absolut nichts mitbekommen.",5,2018,01,03

Ahora, totalmente renovado hasta en el nombre, Sofía, nos encontramos que sin perder su buen espíritu, es un modernísimo hotel con todas las comodidades que los adelantos tecnológicos puede ofrecer.  El personal tanto de Recepción como del Restaurante están siempre dispuestos a complacerte.

21,Noche especial en pareja,"Como algo especial quisimos darnos un capricho mi marido y yo. Pasamos una tarde noche fabulosa. Primero hicimos check in, tots muy amables. Fuimos a la habitación y inmeditamente nos subieron unas amenitties de chocolote y frutos rojos. Fuimos a tomas una copa con unas pequeñas tapas (un tartar buenísimo) en el bar del Sofia, estuvimos muy relajados en un ambiente exclusivo. Seguidamente cenamos en el IMPAR, un ambiente alegre y distendido, unas tapas estupendas.
Pasamos la noche en el SOFIA, la habitación en la planta 10 estupenda, el colchón comodísimo, unas almohadas super esponjosas. Las amenitties del baño de una marca que me encanta, Natura Bisse... por la mañana en vez de elegir el desayuno Buffet elegimos desayunar algo rápido en el Philosophia... calidez y calidad. Fue solo una noche, pero seguro volveremos.",5,2017,11,07
21,Trato e instalaciones espectaculares,"Nos hospedamos en este hotel en un viaje de negocios. Nuestro grupo constaba de aproximadamente 25 personas. Todos hemos salido encantados con la reforma del hotel. El diseño es precioso, el trato del personal excelente. Las habitaciones tienen un diseño muy vanguardista. El desayuno buffet es impresionante. El cuidado del personal encargado de las habitaciones, a la cabeza de Patricia Jimenez, es sencillamente exquisito. Desde luego voy a repetir, pero esta vez, con mi familia. 
Merece totalmente la pena probar tanto el restaurante IMPAR, a cargo del Chef Víctor, como la cafetería Philosofia.",5,2017,10,06
21,"Restaurantes, bar y cafetería","El antiguo princesa sofía había sido nuestro punto de reunión después de las jornadas laborales, especialmente en la antigua terraza alemana que, a mi parecer, en la reforma, este espacio ha perdido el encanto que tenía, ahora estar en la terraza no es para nada atractivo.

Por un lado, tenemos el Philosophia como cafetería que está muy bien pero por el horario que tenemos nos va mejor el bar que a no ser que haya huéspedes extranjeros bebiendo como verdaderos alcohólicos y gritando (sí, es increíble la transformación de algunos british cuando pisan suelo Español...), es un lugar muy tranquilo con camareros muy amables y atentos. Mención especial: echamos de menos algunos de los camareros que trabajaban antes en el antiguo bar, el piano también ha desaparecido y las tardes de jazz :'( y los San Francisco se preparan modernos, sabemos que todo cambia, pero ¡es que había un camarero que preparaba los mejores San Francisco de Barcelona! Perdimos, todo sea dicho, la oportunidad de probar el ""Catalunya Misteriosa"" de la antigua carta, ¡ya nunca sabremos a qué sabía! Sin embargo, hemos podido probar varios cócteles y bebidas de la nueva carta, así como postres y muy bien. 

Tenemos pendiente la cena en Be So, habrá que esperar a algún evento que se lo haga valer.

El IMPAR es muy buen lugar para comer o cenar, la verdad es que el espacio ha mejorado muchísimo y la decoración transmite tranquilidad. El primer día que fuimos el personal iba un poco lento y despistado, suponemos que porque hacía muy poco que habían inaugurado.

Tenía pendiente esta reseña desde hace dos meses y, la verdad, vale la pena el nuevo espacio. Es verdad que se han perdido cosas, pero también se han ganado muchas. Y en la zona hacía falta un restaurante como el IMPAR.

Lo que menos me ha gustado del hotel: no soy partidaria del servilismo y esto de que hayan puesto unas puertas en las que una persona tiene que abrírtela (como en las tiendas de lujo de Paseo de Gracia) no me gusta... Supongo que tendrán funciones de seguridad, pero es excesivo. Otra cosa que me incomoda, aunque también entiendo que es por seguridad, es que el personal de la recepción en seguida te pregunta a dónde vas, sé que se hace con actitud de orientar pero a veces lo encuentro demasiado abrumador.",5,2017,10,06
21,Modernes Ambiente ,"Das noch in Renovierung befindliche Hotel wirkte - in der bereits renovierten Fläche -  sehr modern und angenehm hell. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das (renovierte) Zimmer war sauber und ansprechend, mir persönlich (bin ggf etwas empfindlich) war aber zu viel Straßenlärm wahrzunehmen. Dabei soll dies noch eines der ruhigeren Zimmer gewesen sein. Das Frühstück war gut. Das Mittagessen im hoteleigenen Restaurant fand ich zu teuer, für das was geboten wurde. Die Gegend, in der das Hotel liegt, lädt nicht zum Flanieren sein.
