16,Perfect Stay,"I recently stayed at this hotel with my family, and everything went smoothly. The location was perfect, and the staff were very attentive.

Delicious breakfast buffet  and efficient service staff in all restaurant and bars . Although the rooms are slightly small, the overall experience met our expectations in terms of quality service. 

The timing of the music in the mornings around the pool area should be reconsidered, as it may be disruptive to the guests in their rooms.",5,2024,10,10
16,super nice stay and excellent services,"Thanks for the super nice stay, the room was very nice. The restaurant / bar was great. I would recommend definitely the menu at the restaurant. The service and the team 
 were excellent and super professional. A big thank you to Daniela who made our stay comfortable and took care of us from the beginning till the end and always with a smile :)",5,2024,01,21
16,Everything fabulous,"We loved our entire stay. Clean facilities, lovely staff. Very nice atmosphere at the bar. Loved the music. Most amazing breakfast, our waitress Sol is a lovely lady, always attentive and made it extra beautiful of us üôèüèæ. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2024,10,07
16,Thank you for the wonderful service,"Apart from the comfortable hotel with great facilities, comfy bed, delish breakfast, cool rooftop, a few steps away from the broad walk - I decided to write this review to thank Hanan who has made me feel so welcome every morning at breakfast. Her service is second to none, always attentive without being overwhelming, just perfect. She cares and it shows - it‚Äôs people like her who truly make a difference to somebody‚Äôs experience.",5,2024,10,03
16,Mostly excellent I would definitely come again.,"Wow the beds, the staff, the pool and the location - we love the Arts hotel next door and this exceeded in quality and experience. Our room with the sea view was beautiful, the gym is well equipped and air conditioned, dinner at Tendiez was exceptional and the breakfast buffet is fabulous. 

A couple of downers - on our 3rd day we paid for our drinks by the pool and discovered the wine we had ordered at Eur37 was now being charged at Eur45 - apparently they had had a price change that was not reflected on the menu - they refunded it and promised to align both - but it was very odd!.
On our last morning at breakfast I ordered Avocado on toast - (on the first morning it arrived within 10 minutes was beautifully prepared, heaped in avocado, baby tomatoes and baby leaf and was delicious) - on the last day the waitress clearly forgot and 30 mins later I asked where it was to which a vague 'Ooooh' a look back at her book and no comment, then she wrote on her pad, tore it off and left it on the side while she cleared a table. I then watched as she surreptitiously picked up the paper and walked out the back of the restaurant to the kitchen and the order appeared about 3 minutes later with a tiny amount of avocado on toast that had been waved at a heater with 2 half tomatoes on top - it was clearly rushed. Had she apologised and asked if i was willing to wait another 10 minutes while it was done properly i would have at least had a choice but this way was an awful reflection of the rest of our experience.",5,2024,10,01
16,"Great location, good food, cool rooftop pool and bar","We stayed in the balcony room with sea view: this provided views to the fish art work on the harbour, pool view and sea view. Really enjoyed having the balcony for early morning coffees or afternoon relaxation

Rooms were exactly as in the picture: chairs on the balcony, good bed, coffee and team making facilities and good bathroom with a nice shower.
Not a lot of space if you would travel with 2 big suitcases like us, coming over to Europe for the summer.

Breakfast was a good buffet including churros with inside and outside seating.
We did have small dinner in the restaurant one night and that was really good: very good quality dishes, Spanish with a twist. Lovely service. Would have come back for the gazpacho if we had the time

Rooftop pool was very nice with views over the sea, nice cocktails. Busy but towards the end of the day there was always a seat opening up

Really enjoyed our stay, fab location along the boulevard with an easy walk into the old city along the waterfront",4,2024,09,23
16,Good experience,"Very comfortable , clean and warm bed room . Plenty of electric sockets to charge my devices and work with my laptop. Great TV and really excellent hot shower, so easy to use. Friendly staff and fantastic breakfast really delicious, rich and well organised, very good service specially Hanan.and Meriam .. absolutely will return back ..",5,2024,09,19
16,High Quality Hotel,"The hotel was very central for the marina and beach, and also for boarding a ""hop on hop off"" bus.
The bedroom was luxuriously decorated and the large pillows were the most comfortable I've ever experienced! I'm now trying to find the same ones to purchase. My head just touched the pillow and I instantly fell asleep!
We loved the rooftop terrace with bar and swimming pool, very relaxing.  We ate in the restaurant on the first night and I recommend the paella.  The staff were very friendly.
 There was a lot of choice for breakfast and it was very relaxing to sit outside in the garden. We hope to return sometime.",5,2024,09,08
16,Wonderful stay at Sofitel Skipper Barcelona,We had a wonderful stay at the Sofitel Skipper Barcelona. All the staff were warm and friendly. Housekeeping was excellent and the concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Hanan in the restaurant made our breakfast experience each morning extra special with wonderful service and the best smile. She always got our coffee order as we like it.,5,2024,09,07
16,Not worth the cost benefit.,"There was a fly in the room. Chromecast didn‚Äôt work. Even with my gold status at ALL they didn‚Äôt offered a room upgrade or even a late check out. To stay until 3 p.m. they wanted to charge me in EUR 60. For the ALL welcoming drink only wine, beer and soft drinks were available, while at another Accor hotel around the world you can use it for cocktails. Pool is good but always crowded. A private event closed the other pool and I can‚Äôt use it.",2,2024,08,26
16,Lovely experience üòä,"The experience was lovely - The hotel is very clean, the staff are friendly and helpful (the ones at the reception, Hanan in the breakfast area)‚Ä¶ 
Its location is good - close to the main venues.
(placa de Catalu√±a‚Ä¶the Marina)
Highly recommended !!",5,2024,08,24
16,Best place to stay in Barcelona!,"Hanen was amazing!!! So attentive and the food was great! This is a wonderful hotel. Modern, trendy and luxurious! Two pools (including one on the rooftop with wonderful views of the beach and city). The location was in a short walking distance of the restaurants and club area. Staff has been amazing over all.",5,2024,08,18
16,Amazing restaurant and staff- HANEN is the best!!,Hanen was the absolute best server!! She is so attentive and kind.  The food was outstanding and their bar is top shelf.  Hanen and the rest of the team at the pool restaurant‚Äôs service help to make this hotel the top tier hotel that it is.  Can‚Äôt wait to return and I‚Äôll definitely ask for Hanen!,5,2024,08,18
16,A wonderful experience,"The view was beautiful and the people working there are so sweet. 
Certainly Sibel, with her excellent skills in making cocktails, really made our night by providing some smart cocktail insights, lovely presence and overall kindness üòäüòäüòä",5,2024,08,18
16,Very good,"Very nice stay in Sofitel Barcelona. The staff is very kind and helpful especially Hanane in the restaurant during the breakfast. She is very clean very professional and very helpful.
The location is very good near the Barcelona beach and the pool in the rooftop is very nice with a super view on the sea",5,2024,08,16

The staff were friendly and kind.The breakfast was good and thank you so much Hanan she was very friendly and welcoming. I really enjoyed my stay and I will definitely come back to the hotel .",5,2024,08,13
16,Awesome hotel near the beach,This is an awesome hotel near the beach in Barcelona. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The beds were extremely comfortable and the hotel is close to many of the attractions and restaurants. The rooftop pool and bar were amazing. The staff really went out of their way to make sure that everyone was comfortable.,5,2024,08,12
16,Exceptional service. Super friendly and helpful staff.,"We had the most amazing stay at the hotel recently. We stayed at a number of top rated hotels during our European tour and this was the best of them all. 

Everything about the establishment is amazing, very clean and smells great. It has everything guests need to enjoy the hotel without a needing to go anywhere else. 

The entire hotel staff is well trained; professional, and makes  you feel valued as a guest. They help without complaining. 
Hanen and Axel were particularly exceptional.",5,2024,08,09
16,Lights went out and they couldn't fix it,"we went with friends and first two nights were okay but the 3rd night the lights went out for the entire hotel and it only came back accept on 3rd floor where we were. We were not informed when its coming back or anything until we checked on them. I had to ask them to move us as I had a litte toddler, My husband couldn't even go to his friends birthday party and the next day again we were not told if we staying in the room they moved or going back. The night manager was much more helpful than the morning one. In the end,  I did ask for compensation but I did not get an apology from the manager who was their in the morning. Also as a five star hotel you would think electricity should be fixed but it wasn't fixed until we left. ",3,2024,08,08
16,Wonderful,Our families morning started off with a wonderful breakfast that was cared for by the entire staff... I had the pleasure of being served by Hanen + Juan Pablo + August which was a perfect  start for the day! Later in the day we had our bartender Paul (from Tennessee) that made my family different smoothies to satisfy their cravings ;),5,2024,08,02
16,Barca on the beach,"Really nice almost waterfront hotel at the end of the Barceloneta. Clearly up scale. Great pools- one roof top w beautiful Balearic Sea views. Nice oasis to return to after day of touring around. Only down side is it‚Äôs out of the way. Requires taxi to more central location for decent restaurants for dinner. Hotel dining one night was excellent. Breakfast wonderful. Pricey but worth it. Great service, security all over. I would return.",5,2024,07,31
16,Ratings for hanan,The hotel was incredible everything was good and we met one of the staff members hanan from the restaurant she was so kind and sweet and understood everything we said she was really calm with us and she took our order very fast and got our order was correctly,5,2024,07,30
16,Great hotel and location,"The hotel provided everything you would expect for a five star hotel.  The room was very comfortable and we had a sea view.   
Breakfasts were outstanding and the staff very attentive.   In fact all the staff were very helpful and pleasant. 
The parking at Euros30 is a bit expensive but the car park is secure.  
The town centre is within easy reach [a 15 minute walk].  The location provides all that is needed for restaurants etc as Barceloneta is an easy walk along the beach. 
We had mentioned that we were celebrating a 'big' birthday and they gave  us a birthday cake which was really appreciated.
When we go to Barcelona again we will definitely stay there again.",5,2024,07,30
16,"Definitely don‚Äôt recommend, not a true 5 star hotel. Really disappointed from our stay","We just came back from Spain and we stayed the first 3 nights at the Sofitel Barcelona Skipper and had an incredibly disappointing experience. 

Here are the issues we faced:

Delayed Check-In: 
We arrived at noon after a long trip, only to find that none of our rooms were ready. After waiting for more than an hour, only one room was ready, I had initially booked the deluxe city view room and apparently they changed us to a lower room because I had requested 2 connecting rooms because of the children without even acknowledging it, it doesn't end there.

Room conditions:
 Upon entering our room, with the first shower use it got clogged, causing the room to flood with water. Despite calling twice for assistance, no one came to fix the issue. I had to personally go to the reception and ask for help. Shockingly, the front desk suggested we use the gym shower, which was unacceptable given that we had two kids with us. Eventually, someone was sent to fix the shower.

The air conditioning in our room was not working properly, making the room extremely humid with no ventilation. The rooms we were given had no windows, making the situation even worse. (see pictures below) 

I was fed up at this point and requested to change rooms, the reception staff was unhelpful and indifferent to our issues. When I complained about the flooded room and AC problems, I was told there were no other rooms available. and he wasnt even able to give us the second room, we didn't get our second room until 8:00 pm that day. 
The second day, I went to the reception and a gentleman at the concierge was at least apologetic but still unable to offer a solution. only offered us 2 separate rooms with the city view (that I had initially booked) but were separate and not connecting, which wouldn't really work with young children.

Breakfast:
The breakfast options were very limited, and no variety. not a 5 star hotel breakfast, wouldt recommend paying extra for it.

Pool:
While the rooftop pool was nice, it was very deep (starting at 1.50 meters and going up to 1.80 meters), making it unsuitable for children.

The only positive aspect of our stay was the rooftop pool, despite its depth issues. and the hotel location. Thank God we were only there for three nights. I would never recommend this hotel.",1,2024,07,29
16,Rooms Too hot!  They look nice but 26.5C at 9p is too hot.,"Worst experience ever. Nothing like having to downgrade room from a suite that you paid for to 2 rooms because its 80 degrees in the room and the AC doesn't work/ or cant keep up. They knew this when they put us in the room, the bellman making recommendations on how to keep it cool. The building has full glass sides facing mid day sun, with inferior AC. Brilliant! Be careful if you stay here!

16,"SofitelHotel and Rooftop bar experience was amazing. Really friendly staff, great music and sea views. Will come again..","We stayed in this hotel for three days. Really nice hotel and staff. Rooftop bar was amazing, great ambient and music. There was also amazing view on the beach from the bar. Our bartender Carlos was super friendly and made our experience better. Food was delicious‚Ä¶",5,2024,07,27
16,Great vacation spot,"The hotel was very nice with a very nice personnel ( at breakfast, Hanane help us a lot). The food was very good and the location is near the city center as well as the beach. The overall ambiance was very wholesome and cozy We would for sure recommend staying here.",5,2024,07,23
16,Absolutely delightful,"Lovely breakfast, Helen in the breakfast place remembered my drink and Carlos in the bar in the pool top has very good service. Don‚Äôt worry about extra charges because it‚Äôs worth it. The whole hospitality team deserves more tips and a pay rise. :)",5,2024,07,23
16,An ncredible swimming pool roof top with Med view.,"By far mypreferred Hotel location in Barcelona super conveniently located.
Close to the harbor, beaches and still at walking distance from Las Ramblas,
An incredible swimming pool roof top with Med view.

Rooms are splendid, and very practicle, personnel is highly efficient and helpfull.",5,2024,07,22
16,Lovely place ,"Amazing place!! We came with a friend and the attention is 10/10, staff very friendly!  Beautiful views, food was delicious. We recommend the carpaccio. Also we wanted some fruity drinks and the bartender made a special drink out of the menu for us! üòç We are definitely coming back! ",5,2024,07,21
16,Great stay,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, great food, the service was top notch. The room was very comfortable and big. They were really on top of things here. We had the paella at the hotel restaurant which was great. The pools were pretty. The hotel was actually quiet",5,2024,07,16
16,Amazing service,"I like the breakfast and serves specially Miriam she is amazing and Hanan she is nice very nice stuff super service professional team in the restaurant and concierge, however the reception team was very bad and not professional at all, the problem she was a supervisor hhhhhhh but really it was a bad experience she gave me different room not matching with my reservation she never smiled and talked in rough way.",5,2024,07,10
16,Amazing Hotel,"We visited this hotel for 3 days and it was superb. Beautful place and the people were really helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, a real credit to the company. Check in was a breeze, room was fantastic, pools and bars were amazing. Made our trip to Barcelona so much more special.",5,2024,07,08
16,"Stay away, not a five star resort","I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my stay at Sofitel Barcelona. From the moment I arrived, the service was nowhere near what you'd expect from a five-star hotel.

First, no one helped with my bags at the door. I was denied early check-in and the front desk staff were unaccommodating and indifferent. At the pool, I had to track down towels and set up my own daybed because no one offered any help.

There was no turndown service or late-night cleaning. Even today, one of my last days here, I still haven‚Äôt received any room service. The maids just don‚Äôt come, and there's no accountability.

The room didn‚Äôt even have a proper desk, which is essential. The air conditioner doesn‚Äôt get cold, and other reviews mention the same issue. The bathrooms resemble those of a dorm and smell horrible. The AC, TV, and Wi-Fi didn‚Äôt work at all.

The whole place is falling apart, and no one seems to care. The pool decks and fixtures looks aged, and the entire hotel needs refurbishing. None of the employees seem to care‚Äîthey're all indifferent. I‚Äôve never been to a hotel with this many issues.",1,2024,07,07
16,Fantastic!!,"This hotel is fantastic. The room is lovely, very convenient, great location, staff is fantastic, friendly and helpful, breakfast was delicious. This hotel has two pools  - one on ground floor and a very nice rooftop pool .  great views of ocean!  Room service 24 hour and food delicious. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,07
16,Best Experience ever,I just hav the absolute best experience in a roof top in my life !‚Ä¶ the lobster  cannelloni and penne rigatte pescatore .. the wine and the highlight of the night ! The crew is magnificent ! And Carlos The Venezuelan is depinga.. the wine ! And the absolute view made the best experience in my life in Barcelona .. Love Love Love Sofitel,5,2024,07,07
16,Not what I was expecting from this property,"a good location and near the beach which was a plus, however there were several aspects of the hotel that was a disappointment especially for a five star hotel and the sofitel brand.
There was a damp bad water smell is my first room I was moved to another room however the small was there too not as strong.
The towels in the bathroom were hard-not white and fluffy! 
The pool deck did not open at 9am as stated the day I went the door opened at 9-25 and towels didnt arrive on both days until past 10am.
Breakfast was OK but lacked that farm to table freshness.All the Hot items were cold including the coffee that I sent back twice.
Drinks in the hotel were very expensive.",3,2024,07,07
16,Not up to 5 star standards,"We have mixed feelings about the Sofitel Barcelona.  Is the hotel beautiful, yes it is. Is the service for the rooms 5 star, it is not. 
We checked in with no issues, and our junior suite is beautiful. We are unable to get the room cool enough though for our liking, and the a/c shuts off in the middle of the night so we wake up halfway through very hot trying to get the room cooler.
The Sofitel offers turn down service (all 5 star properties do), but this is non existent. We asked for it twice the first night, they never came. The second night we asked for it before we left for dinner, came back to see it wasn‚Äôt done, went downstairs to talk to reception. Olga who is at reception is a shining light! She was persistent to get someone to get our room attended to. We gave up on our third night requesting it, and weren‚Äôt surprised to come back to our hotel that night to find it wasn‚Äôt done.
We have also been comparing this stay to our stay at the Sofitel London and found that the London Sofitel went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing stay, while this hotel falls short. In London, little notes and small biscuits or chocolates were left in our room daily and there isn‚Äôt anything like that here.
I think a big issue is that all inquiries are made by calling reception. They then relay messages to whomever it needs to go. We have called about 5 times about receiving some ice and ice bucket to our room, and have only received ice twice. There seems to be no accountability to the areas delivering the actual service, if that makes sense.
The hotel is beautiful and the breakfast is lovely everyday, but the hotel faulters in the service to rooms, which is important to us.",3,2024,07,05
16,El cielo rooftop,"Excellent view, the pool is great, the drinks and service were top notch. There was a DJ playing good music. The general ambiance was super nice and friendly. We spent few hours with my husband before going out for dinner and will do it again for sure.  I really recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a nice time on a rooftop .",5,2024,07,01
16,Welcoming experience,I had the pleasure last month to be at the Sofitel Hotel. The service was very good and the staff was so friendly. I got a very detailed explanation about the cocktails I order. So definitely ask after Sibel if you want to know what you are drinking or what you should be drinking base on your taste of course.,5,2024,06,30
16,Amazing service!,"We had an anmazing experience! 
Got a very detailed explanation of the cocktail by our amazing bartender Sibel! 
She was super nice and knew exactly what she talking about! 
Definitely going to go back here to drink her amazing cocktails. 10/10!!!",5,2024,06,30

16,Exceptional staff,"The breakfast was phenomenal. Everything was super fresh and the quality of the fruit is amazing. Not to mention the staff is very warm and friendly.

16,Best experience,"I spent 4 days at Sofitel Skipper Barcelona with my family and we have an awesome experience.
Top location by the beach, beautiful and large rooms, outstanding pool on roof top, amazing breakfast/ great food quality, very good level of service. I strongly recommend this hotel",5,2024,06,23
16,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"What an amazing stay at the Sofitel  Skipper and the perfect way to end our month long trip  .   The hotel is in a perfect location - right at marina and walking distance to the Gothic area. We enjoyed relaxing at the rooftop pool - lovely area to chill and unwind.  The rooms are amazing , clean, spacious with all the amenities. The beds and pillows  are some of the most comfortable I have been on.   Do not miss out on the breakfast buffet - one of the best I have seen  anywhere with the absolute best service.  All personnel went above and beyond during out stay and we cannot recommend this hotel enough.  We Will definitely check back next time we are in Barcelona",5,2024,06,21
16,Thanks to great service,Special and great thanks to Hanane from the restaurant for the great hospitality and nice service. Nice welcome and nice smile with accountability and sens of customer care. Looking forward to visit you soon in this nice area and nice city Barcelona,5,2024,06,21
16,Beautiful Stay in Barcelona,"We loved everything about the hotel. The sheets and mattress were amazing for a wonderful night‚Äôs sleep. The food in the hotel restaurant was great. The breakfast buffet had everything you could ever want, and the hotel was beautiful and clean. We especially enjoyed the rooftop pool with the lively music and attentive servers. But most of all, the friendly staff was truly amazing. They really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. We consider some of them new friends! Highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,06,20
16,A new standard that we will measure every other hotel against,"My husband and I have just returned from 5¬Ω weeks in Europe and one of the highlights of the entire trip was our stay at this beautiful hotel.
Our room was fabulous, but it was the personal service of the staff that made our stay so special. 

I arrived 12 hours before my husband and the staff were particularly helpful and friendly. eg: Carrying my bags to my room. Ensuring I had everything I needed (blanket not doona), ensuring I knew where in the hotel I could get a great meal (it was late).

From the way I was greeted at reception, to the bar staff, to the wonderful guest relations manager (who organised my manicure, printing of travel documents, restaurant tips etc) every single team member went out of their way to provide a standard of personal service that I will never forget. When it came time to leave the hotel and board our cruise I seriously would have preferred to just stay where I was for 14 days!

Sofitel Barcelona Skipper is now the hotel that we will measure every hotel against. Thank you and Congratulations. We will return!",5,2024,06,17
16,A must stay if your looking for somewhere nice near the beach.,"The hotel was well placed, the facilities were vert good and the staff very friendly and happy.
We really did think the staff were very good, nothing was any trouble for them and treated us very well.
The room was very well presented and clean with all the extras you can expect.
The restaurant served very good food and breakfast was also very good.
We would certainly use this hotel if we return to Barcelona.
Thank you for a great few days.",5,2024,06,16
16,Best hotel and staff!,"Excellent service from all staff. (Restaurant, bar, housekeeping, concierge) 

The room was gorgeous and had great amenities. The food was amazing and room was so comfortable. We also enjoyed the fitness center. 

We will return! Highly recommend to other travelers.",5,2024,06,10
16,Not up to expectations.,"I booked the hotel for 4 nights. I booked 2 connecting rooms as we are 2 adults and 2 children. One of the rooms had a balcony, the other not. We arrived around 11am an one of the rooms was immediately given to us, the other one later in the afternoon. The rooms are not large, just ok. The connecting doors can not be kept open, and so it is a burden to move from one room to another. I am really wondering how such design flaws can be made.... . The room without balcony had only a tiny and dirty window. The hotel has 2 pools : one on the ground floor : it is not heated and therefor people do not swim here. There was also no service at that pool. The second one on the roof : this pool is heated and everyone wants to come here. Downside is the number of sunbeams is very limited and we never found space. Why are not the 2 pools heated? Towels you need to get at the reception!!! Why not at the pool??? Things could be so easy. Breakfast was good. However the washrooms in the area really need service. All the paper rolls were broken. On 2 consecutive days there was no soap filled to wash hands, so one can imagine how people go to the buffet... . Dinner in the restaurant was very good and the service as well. Overall there where a lot of small things that did not work, where broken and therefore this place for me is not what I expected.",3,2024,05,31
16,Exceptional service,Rooms and common areas very nice.  Only negative is rooms could use a little more storage space.  Location is great if you are looking for the beach/club scene.  Staff was outstanding and service levels were exceptional.  A bit of a hike to get to Gothic or Born area but walkable.  Those walks were a good way to digest the large Catalonian meals we enjoyed.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2024,05,29
16,Spectacular rooftop ,This review is specifically for the rooftop bar/restaurant. We had a spectacular birthday celebration here. Amazing service! Cheers to Carlos and Martin who really took care of us! Fantastic view and vibe with really good food and drink options. We've experienced many rooftops in Barcelona and this is definitely one of the best.,5,2024,05,20
16,Great staff and beautiful property,"Fantastic staff and property.  We have been blown away by the staff at the Sofitel Barcelona.   We had a large group and they accommodated an early check in and the rooms were amazing!  Elodie and Carlos at the rooftop bar couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.   Great food, drinks and atmosphere!",5,2024,05,20
16,Our first choice hotel,"Chose this hotel  for location, near beach restaurants & bars. Room had everything one would need. Excellent bar & breakfast. Staff are so friendly & helpful. Definitely recommend this hotel. We are going again in November for 1 night before boarding a ship for a cruise.",5,2024,05,20
16,Mark made our experience memorable,Mark was brilliant. The restaurant was full but he was able to have us seated despite this fact. He checked on us and even treated us to a special cocktail at the end of the evening. We never felt rushed as a family and enjoyed our time in the restaurant.,5,2024,05,18
16,Excellent hotel and location ,"I stayed here for one night, a lovely hotel very close to the beach and walking distance to the old town. The breakfast was superb, our waitress was so attentive - would stay here again. Rooms were spacious, shower powerful, beds super comfy, had a great night's sleep. The pool and outside areas were 5*",5,2024,05,12
16,Not Five Stars,"Our experience was not five stars. While the rooms are stylish they are not practical for storing enough clothing and shoes. Our sound bar under the TV  turned on remotely somehow super loud in the middle of the night two times interrupting our sleep. Apparently a bluetooth issue. Our phone kept flashing without reason. Our meal at Tendiez was expensive but very average. The fish was non descriptive without flavor, just plonked onto the plate with three tiny mussels . While the pork shank was tender it lacked any flavor and the glaze was too minimal and  without any pizazz. Service was just ok.  The overly loud thumping house music from 10:00 am onward at the roof top pool which was the only ‚Äúopen‚Äù pool was horrendous. This is not a Zen experience. Perhaps at night with a bar crowd but not at 10am. Know your demographic! A couple of pluses are the downstairs bar in Tendiez, the cocktails were really delicious and well done. Service was wonderful. Breakfast was also nice with good service and staff at reception were polite. Now for the most positive experience which was above and beyond five stars: our luggage was left behind at Stansted airport with Ryan Air due to an electric failure of the luggage carry belt.  The Ryan Air help desk was anything but helpful saying that our luggage would be delivered sometime late like 1:00 or 2:00 am. and that we would be called. When that didn‚Äôt happen we tried calling the number provided when we filled out our claim form. The next morning Misha, who at one time worked at the airport, phoned a former colleague for any information. He was told our bags had arrived and would be delivered during the day. Misha phoned us to tell us this information as we were on a tour. He then phoned us again at 12:30 to say our bags were at the hotel. MISHA gets ten stars for thinking outside the box and going above and beyond for us.",3,2024,05,06
16,Let down by service and housekeeping ,"As a Diamond ALL member, having visited Sofitels all over the world, I was underwhelmed vs the price paid (which as 5* hotels go is on the high end of the spectrum). The letdown being service and housekeeping.

Pros: We had a great check in, and a very early access to the room granted, free coffee while we wait, ALL upgrade granted etc. The doorman was always friendly every time we passed by in the lobby. The restaurant is excellent, breakfast is heavenly (including the new haute croissanterie), the ALL welcome drink covers the whole cocktail menu. 

Cons:
- Room service scattered each day with various items not being replaced. Had to call every day. Running out of shower gel mid shower from their wall dispenser.
- Shower drain smells awful, have to keep door closed at all times.
- Being disturbed on do-not-disturb via phone and door knocks for non urgent things, multiple times
-  Diamond welcome gift not delivered. We did have DND on a period but then it didn't come on the second day, third day, asking multiple times we got it the evening before checkout.
- Took 50 minutes and 3 calls to get champagne bucket of ice, and then we got brought just ice no bucket.
- Concierge not that friendly or offering greetings when walking past
- Many other cons on service and housekeeping make this far from a true 5* experience ",3,2024,04,29
16,An Early Birthday Treat to Remember at Sofitel Barcelona,"Booking our stay at the Sofitel Barcelona via email was a breeze, thanks to Im√®ne and Melyne who secured a fantastic rate for us. Upon arrival, we were delighted to receive an upgraded room with a balcony offering a stunning view of the beach, making for a perfect pre-birthday celebration complete with a complimentary cake and champagne. The service at the hotel was impeccable. The concierge was particularly helpful, recommending a spectacular flamenco show and assisting with transportation needs like taxis.

Although we opted out of the breakfast deal, we had a wonderful time at the Tendiez Bar, where a friendly bartender made excellent cocktail recommendations. We regret not catching the names of the exceptional staff. Additionally, the Rooftop Bar was a highlight, providing an opportunity to enjoy delicious cocktails while taking in breathtaking city views.

The hotel's location is ideal, just a short walk to the beach and mere seconds from two bus stops, making it extremely convenient to explore Barcelona. My experience at Sofitel Barcelona was nothing short of amazing, and I would definitely love to stay here again on my next visit.",5,2024,04,22

The bar and restaurant (Tendiez) were both really good, we ate in both and were very happy with both the quality and service.
What made the hotel really stand out for us was the staff. Juan and his colleagues in the bar were great as were the reception staff (didn‚Äôt get his name but the tall, quietly spoken man with glasses was really helpful). Also, Geuis who met us when we arrived and went out of his way to make sure everything was good for us throughout our entire stay. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,02,27

16,A Delightful Stay at a Luxurious Hotel,"This hotel is just stunning, with its spacious rooms that make you feel like royalty. And let's talk about those beds and pillows ‚Äì they're like sleeping on clouds! Plus, they've got all these fancy amenities that make you feel pampered.
The decorations around the hotel and in the rooms are so classy and elegant ‚Äì it's like walking into a magazine spread.

It is very well priced for a luxury hotel and in a great location next to the beach and restaurants. Easy drive from the airport. Highly recommend",5,2024,02,06
16,Wonderful Experience,"First of all, even though I had some difficulties during the reservation process, I would like to thank the guest services manager Miss Fatima for her efforts, effective communication skills and professionalism in turning this review from being full of complaints into a wonderful accommodation experience . 

If you are in Barcelona for entertainment or business purposes, the facility I would recommend to you without hesitation would be Sofitel Barcelona Skipper. The comfort of your room will be as good as the comfort of your home, and the attention of the hotel staff will leave you with nothing to think about other than your work or entertainment. The gorgeous rooftop terrace and heated pool were very inviting. 

As a Muslim Turk, I must say that I found the hotel breakfast adequate, but perhaps it could have been better. The ""sweet dreams"" note and a cup of tea that greeted me in my bed every evening made me feel that I was truly thought of. There were bidets and bidet showers in the sinks for Muslim visitors. Room service was very fast. 

Due to its location, the hotel did not cause any difficulties for those who like to explore the city on foot during their travels, it was close to the central points. 

My only negative comment was that there was no Turkish coffee in the hotel, of course it would be nice if there was but thats the fun complaining this actually :) 

Based on my own experience, I would definitely recommend Sofitel Barcelona Skipper to you for a five-star accommodation in every sense.",5,2024,02,01
16,Incredible Staff,"The rooms are beautiful, the staff are extremely attentive and make every guest feel like they are a VIP. They also have incredible items available twenty four hours on  their room service list. The rooftop pool was closed for the season but the deck and view of the ocean was spectacular.",5,2024,01,24
16,Superb hotel combining great accommodation and very efficient staff,"Great service and all staff were a credit to the hotel. The standard of room and its fittings were first class.
Best stay of our many visits to Accor Hotels.
From the time of our arrival until our departure 6 days later we experienced a great stay and enjoyed the best Customer Service from every department.
Am very keen to spread the word to my many traveller friends recommending that they stay when next in Barcelona.",5,2024,01,17
16,Very nice Hotel in Barcelona,"Last week I stayed at the Sofitel Barcelona resort, me and my family,the experience was the ¬†best i ever had.

16,Great service for a family with 2 young kids,"Sofitel Barcelona Skipper is excellent. I have stayed there as a couple with 2 young kids and it went pretty smoothly. Rooms are very well served with an extremely confortable bed, had a good basinet for my baby and had often some good surprise when back from a day of sightseeing. I should mention the amenities are a plus. Breakfast and room service were great. Ben, Giovana and other folks provided a great experience, specially while dealing with small kids.",5,2023,12,19
16,Amazing. See above!,The service at Sofitel Barcelona was simply amazing! The service and hospitality provided by Miss Pauline at the breakfast area was superb. All other staff members like Myriam and Ben were second to none. We‚Äôll definitely be back and will tell all our friends about our experience. Thanks !,5,2023,12,18
16,Not quite top of the range,Lovely hotel albeit the rooms were a little bit cramped (we had 2 suites and it felt that there was more furniture than space). Bathrooms are stunning. Breakfast was excellent. Front of house staff very helpful. ,4,2023,12,18
16,A great luxury hotel and awesome restaurant,Such a great hotel and restaurant. This brand new hotel is so well located by the sea and very close to the city center. We had a great experience with a wonderful Christmas lunch: a selection of local dishes and wines. The service mainly done by Carla was awesome. I strongly recommend this hotel and the restaurant. One of the best Sofitel in Europe!,5,2023,12,14
16,We enjoyed our stay.,"We found the location of the hotel perfect, away from the rush and noise yet only a short walk from  the busy areas. 
The staff, with no exceptions, were very attentive. On arrival we unsure of what to include in our itinerary so  the reception staff gave us a number of great suggestions.
The breakfast staff were friendly and made our coffees in the specific way in which we had asked.
We had a pleasant dinning experience at the hotels' restaurant. The DJ, waiter and bar staff were all very nice.
We enjoyed making use of the gym which has all the latest equipment and is rarely in use. 
When the time came to depart, the porter offered to arrange our airport transfer and held our luggage  for us so that we could check out and make the most of our final day in Barcelona.",5,2023,12,12
16,A Memorable Stay at a Luxurious French-Decor Hotel in Barcelona,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel, the service was exceptional. Genis and his team welcomed us with a cheerful demeanor and a great sense of humor, setting a positive tone for our stay. The amenities added a touch of luxury, especially the Diptyque shower gel, which made us feel truly pampered.

The hotel itself was adorned with exquisite French decor, creating a luxurious and elegant atmosphere that enhanced our experience. However, as an Asian traveler who had been touring Europe for nearly two weeks, I started to long for a taste of home. The hotel‚Äôs daily European-style breakfast was delightful, but after 4 days, I craved something different.

Understanding our needs, Pauline, one of the staff members, kindly arranged for the kitchen to prepare a comforting bowl of noodles with broth on our last day in Barcelona. This thoughtful gesture was deeply appreciated and showcased the staff‚Äôs willingness to go above and beyond.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to express my gratitude to Jovanna. She noticed my traveling partner wasn‚Äôt feeling well and offered fresh mint leaves, ginger slices, and lemon to help her recover. This level of attentive and personalized care truly made our stay memorable.

In summary, this hotel not only impresses with its stunning decor and luxurious amenities but also shines through its exceptional service and attention to guests‚Äô needs. Highly recommended for a splendid stay in Barcelona!",5,2023,12,08
16,Luxury in Barcelona ,Highly recommend. Close to the metro and not far from the main attractions and old town! Friendly staff. Feels like a five star hotel. Amenities and bathroom are definite upgrades from the standard hotel. ,5,2023,11,29
16,Perfect stay,"What a great hospitality in Sofitel Skipper-Barcelona 
Service is outstanding, staff very helpful, respectful and professional 
Special thanks to Brendan in the reception for his professionalism and fast service and of course the right person for the door and concierge Axcell rose for helping me to discover Barcelona through his recommendations 
Definitely will recommend the hotel to my friends in Dubai if they ever come to Barcelona ",5,2023,11,29
16,One of the Best Hotela,"We booked Sofitel for a few nights while traveling in Europe.  Sofitel Skipper is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  I am a retired hotel General Manager.  The staff were ultra trained and paid attention to every detail.  Well located on the waterfront.  The amenities were top notch. 
They take ‚ÄúLadies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen‚Äù to a new level.  This quote is a 90s tag line from another hotel company and is not meant to be gender biased.  If you have never stayed in a Sofitel‚Ä¶Do it.  You will not be disappointed",5,2023,11,23
16,"Friendly staff, great service and amazing room ","From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the service was excellent. The staff were very helpful when we requested to change rooms, and found us a new one right away. The rooms themselves are really luxurious, particularly the bathrooms with his and hers sinks and yacht-like fittings. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud (not literally), so soft and comfortable. The barmen were very helpful and even gave us a round of coffees on the house one of the days which I thought was a really nice touch. Overall a terrific experience and would definitely return.  ",5,2023,11,16
16,Perfect stay,"Great experience at the hotel. It was my second stay. The first time, not long after the opening, there were some glitches for which I had complained a little bit, and now that we came back they really took care of us to ensure everything went perfectly. Rooms are very nice, most importantly service was absolutely perfect.
Location is also great. I was afraid it would be a bit far from center for a touristic stay, but actually it's perfect. On the beach and still within walking distance of many sights / shopping and restaurant areas. And to go further away in Barcelona, metro station is just 5 minutes walk. Definitely hope to be back soon.",5,2023,11,14
16,Perfect holidays,"It was a perfect Short-Trip for our family.
Our daughter (8 years old) were heartily welcome from the stuff. She got a book as a present when we arrived. Every member of the stuff were so friendly. The service was perfect at the reception, during breakfast, at the bar - the chambermaids - everywhere. The location couldn't be better: directly at the beach - everything reachable by bus or subway.",5,2023,11,13
16,Outstanding ,"We loved the hotel and location.  But more importantly the staff from the front desk to the restaurants, bar and front door were exceptional. They made our stay the delight that is was. We look forward to retuning to Barcelona and the Sofitel Barcelona Skipper will of course be our hotel of choice. Thank you to all who made our stay a wonderful experience. ",5,2023,11,13
16,Top Hotel - Best Consierge ever!,"Excellent sevice - Hugo, the concierge provided a true ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù feel. An exeptional character

The hotel is clise to the beach and the city is reached quickly by cab. 

Rooms are lovely and funtional.

The only thing that could be looked at with a negative touch, was the eur 65.- fee for ironing 2 shirts and a pair of pants",5,2023,11,03
16,Lovely place to stay but not for business,"Stayed here for 3 nights end of September as was on a work trip. The hotel and associated rooms were modern in deco, spacious, comfortable and clean. The bed was big and the duvet/pillows were dreamy. Breakfast had a wide variety, nice vegetarian options too.
They have two pools, one lower down and then a rooftop pool. Both were clean and inviting with good bars/food.
Only issue was I needed to work whilst there and the room was not equipped with a desk and chair. They had a comfortable sofa chair with a low coffee table but this is not comfortable if you need to sit on a laptop and churn emails. Instead I decided to go to the rooftop to work from there instead as well as have lunch with colleagues. Food was good but they definitely weren't able to handle a group lunch for 8 people as they got our bill wrong multiple times. Despite telling them at least 7-8 times what we each ordered, we gave up as it was taking too long and we needed to catch flights. Outside of this, lovely experience!",4,2023,10,28
16,Excellent stay,"Great location, and our room was quiet, clean and bright.  The bed was really comfortable. Staff are all great,  whether for cleaning,  reception, breakfast,  dinner  ... special mention for Bernadette in the bar!  Would definitely come back. ",5,2023,10,23
16,Lovely hotel unhygienic bathroom floors. ,"The hotel is of a very high standard.It  is set back from the beach , but it‚Äôs only a 10 minute walk. It‚Äôs a short taxi ride to the city centre and ‚Äúhop on hop off ‚Äú bus stop is located near by. 
We stayed in a suite 326 which had a small terrace. Our booking was for a 2 night stay. The hotel is quite new so the furnishings are fresh and of a high standard. We couldn‚Äôt hear any external noises whist in the suite. 
The staff were attentive courteous and polite. 
We had breakfast in the dining room and the choice from the buffet was impressive. I have a gluten intolerance and it catered very well for my needs. Separate toaster and wide range of items. 
Everything for a great short city break. 

So you must be asking why only 2 stars.However failure to address a matter I brought to their attention I found unacceptable. 
The bathroom was large and beautifully equipped with a good lay out. However there is no other way to say it the floor was filthy disgustingly so. When I pointed it out to reception, and showed them the photo I‚Äôd taken, they assured me most of the rooms were like this and had been since the hotel was built. I could believe it as the tile is the issue. It has an uneven surface and if it‚Äôs just wet mopped when it dries lots of the dust , dirt and anything else that‚Äôs landed on there is left once the water evaporates. I suggested they try a steam cleaner. I asked that the hotel manager check the room but they replied  they‚Äôd send house keeping. I expected a clean floor on our return however it was no different . We would have checked out but it was late and we only were the that night. We had pre paid so just checked out  the following morning .I have emailed the hotel manager with my concerns  but have received no response. I have given  them every opportunity to address the issue both at the time and retroactively , before submitting this review. 

I‚Äôm sure if I can clean the two tiles in the photo with toilet roll and hand soap some solution can be found. It isn‚Äôt acceptable  that a customer  be paying hundreds of euros a night to walk over other people‚Äôs filth.   Providing slippers isn‚Äôt the answer.

",2,2023,10,21
16,Amazing,"Viktor was our waiter and gave us a perfect service, he is a very polite gentleman. Ask for Viktor. Will come here more often. The Hotel is also fabulous! Good food, polite and professional staff and I believe they finally sorted out their card machines. Sad the rooftop bar is closing soon. Great atmosphere. ",5,2023,10,14
16,Fantastic. You will not be dissapointed.,Solid hotel. Rooms are fully stocked. Beds are so comfy. Like the shower bathroom setup. The pool bar on top is great. Super relaxing. Victor and Paul made some excellent cocktails. The Porn star cocktail was delicious. They even have a really nice gym in the basement.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2023,10,14
16,5/5,"Astonishing views, great pool area, excellent service and breakfast. Thank you Victor up at the El Cielo for that extra nice service.

Rooms are of a decent size with high standards, cleaning service meets the expectations and I especially love the upgraded sound system in each room. This was not my first stay and it has even improved since the first time I was around.

Well done.",5,2023,10,14
16,Beach Hotel,"Great rooms and location. Close to the beach, walk able distance. Loved the roof top swimming pool. Close to the airport too. Rooms are well furnished. Food is amazing with a good spread for buffet, especially breakfast.",4,2023,10,12
16,Very good hotel. Not sure if room ok for business travellers though,"Late last week, spent 3 nights at the hotel as part of a delegation attending a conference in Barcelona.  Used to stay at this same property under the previous brand (Pullman) and must say that right now hotel has improved significantly. Newly renovated rooms, upgraded common areas, nice bar, restaurant and poolside lounge. 

Room is very clean, spacious, comfortable, well equipped and with all what you need for a nice stay. Hotel is very well located, just 5 mins taxi from the conference center and a few mins walk from the beach.

Said that, 2 things which let the hotel a bit down:

No desk in the room - I was on business trip, needed to work, spent hours working on emails and presentations but room has no desk nor chair. Just  a low table with 2 small sofas. Very nice, and trendy decor, but definitely very bad for someone who needs to work. I wonder why this is the case, being the hotel so close to the conference centre and hence assume that visited by lots of business travellers.  3 weeks ago stayed at the Sofitel in Paris, and on my review made exactly the same comment. Seems that is a characteristic of the newly renovated Sofitel properties.  As said, after 3 hours seated in such an uncomfortable setting, needed to go out for a walk because my back was hurting.

Stayed in room 234 and there was a very intense and not nice smell coming from the pipes in the toilet.  Because was all day at a conference, didn't bother to ask for a room change, but in some moments smell was really intense. I suggest management to check and remediate.

Leaving this 2 comments aside, all in all, a very good experience",4,2023,10,01
16,Beachside Presence,"The Sofitel Barcelona Skipper is centrally located close to the beach, port and approximately 15 mins walk to La Rambla. 
There‚Äôs lots to do around the hotel; restaurants and bars line the beach promenade. 
The hotel is clean, well appointed and designed. The team are friendly, engaged and welcoming. 
The porters, security and team on the floor at breakfast were incredible.
There are certainly some areas for improvement and opportunities for change for the team on reception (which we‚Äôd not experienced before) as reception are often the pillar and bring other team members within the hotel together.",4,2023,09,30
16,Magnificent Barcelona hotel,"I was in Barcelona for a business conference at a nearby hotel. From check in to the Sofitel, to  checkout I cannot say enough good things about the wonderful staff who went out of their way to help and were always kind, courteous and with a big smile. The concierge, Hallar, gave excellent recommendations. Wonderful team and a flawless stay. Well done!",5,2023,09,22

Breakfast was leisurely, never felt rushed even if going in towards the end of service. Food always replenished with wide variety of choice. Fresh and excellent quality. 
Shout out to Diogo (our waiter) who always had a smile on his face. Always polite, efficient and helpful.
Highly recommended. If we were to return to Barcelona we would not hesitate to also return to the Sofitel Barcelona Skipper.

16,It‚Äôs not a hotel but nightclub.,"Came with my family to have nice 3 nights summer chill. Unfortunately all 3 nights were terribly disturbed by techno dance parties organized on the rooftop. we were staying on the 2. floor - so can imagine the parties were heard in all the rooms localised with the pool/ seaview. i complained about that to the service while party was running but service ‚Äûcouldn‚Äôt do nothing‚Äù about that obviously, as parties were all ‚Äûprivate‚Äù, ‚Äûexclusive‚Äù and paid. 

so i don‚Äôt recommend you go there if you are looking for quiet place for relax and rest. don‚Äôt go there with a babies, unless they have really strong sleep -  same as you, cause you won‚Äôt sleep there. dissapointing, obviously will not come back ever again.",1,2023,07,28

16,Sofitel  disappointed me.  Sofitel Barcelona skipper me decepcion√≥,"The rooms that face to the street  have extrange  tiny small windows near the floor and near the roof, a lot of noise from the street Floor 2.  On the other hand rooms in the 6th floor have noise all night from a pool terrace. I asked for non feeders linens and once I was in the room they send someone to make the arrangements in the bed. Poor layout. The value given doesn¬¥t go in accordance to the price",1,2023,07,24

16,Lovely stay at the Sofitel,"Hotel is nicely renovated and very clean!! My room was spacious and the bed is very comfy.

Reception - everyone is welcoming and attentive to the guests needs. 

I like that there is security at the front  and the floors can only be accessed with your room card. - as a solo traveller this makes me feel for comfortable and safe. 

The restaurant downstairs - 
The food is delicious and the cocktails are even better! 
Raph is fantastic at what he does!! He made me cocktails on the menu and off the menu based on what I liked. Definitely look for him!

The bar manager, Carlos was also lovely and gave me a list of recommendations for Barcelona! Thank you!!

Rooftop terrace - 
Josh was my server both days I spent there, he was very attentive and quick to help me with anything I needed/wanted.
Mamadou was the bartender both days as well and he also makes killer cocktails!

I worked in hospitality for many years and all of these individuals went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable! Thank you for the great experience!",5,2023,07,18
16,Sofitel Barcelona Skipper,Excellent resort at on of the best locations in Barcelona. The hotel was totally upgraded a few months ago. From the moment you arrive you are pampered until you leave.

16,"Worst reception ever, and in case of broken glass cleaning staff should be more attentive","The check in was not the best I ever had. Not the most pleasant people working at the reception.
Didn‚Äôt get the usual upgrade that I get at other hotels thanks to my membership, although rooms were available since I booked the rooms less than an hour before checking in.
The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are great, big, loved the style. The location is not bad in a safe area. The evening went to take a shower and got my foot cut by broken glass on the shower floor. Waked back to the bedroom to change and go to the reception to ask for my room to be changed and stepped on another small peace of glass, thanks to the carpet didn‚Äôt get cut. When I got to the reception, both receptionists weren‚Äôt very glad for me asking a room change. At the end they did change it, the other room had a smell in it but it was already around 1 am so I went for a shower and sleep. I didn‚Äôt even get a ‚ÄúSORRY‚Äù from these two. Only the third receptionist apologized. 
The breakfast was good.
Value for money is good for a Sofitel.",3,2023,07,15
16,Sofitel,"Very nice hotel. The staff is really friendly, and the bar is amazing. Delicious and very special cocktails.

The hotel pools.. ahhh summer is to be spent there, with a cocktail in one hand and your feet on the water.

It's definitely the place to be in Barcelona! Kudos to the team üëè",5,2023,07,11

16,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the hotel Sofitel in Barcelona. This place and staff were amazing! We stayed in a superior room with a very comfortable queen bed. The room was immaculate, extremely clean, comes with full bar, fridge, hair dryer, iron, etc. there was even a doorbell for our hotel room!  

The property as soon as you step in the hotel is beautiful, gorgeous lobby, great restaurant and bar, gym in basement, two fabulous swimming pools (one on roof top which is geared more towards adults and is deeper and the second larger pool more for families with a giant deck, both have plenty of cushioned lounge chair seating and shade options).

The staff was very professional and always ready to help open the door for you, call a taxi, carry your luggage, exceptional room service. Everyone was so nice and helpful. 

We had the breakfast buffet included in our stay which was the best breakfast buffet I ever had! Delicious food and drinks, fresh fruit, pastries, cappuccino, and staff ready to clean and and bring in refills. 

I loved this hotel! The only downside was that we didn‚Äôt have a good view. It was a view of the building next door, but with a hotel so close to the beech I didn‚Äôt waste my time looking out the window.",5,2023,07,11
16,Amazing hotel!,"Fabulous hotel with fantastic service. The roof top bar team are so attentive. Big thanks to Julia and josh for keeping us cool with drinks and smiles. 

Hotel is by the beach, very modern and from reception and concierge to waiting staff you will be looked after! 

Thank you all!",5,2023,07,10
16,Amazing Hotel with Amazing staff,"We have stayed in Barcelona a few times, and was having a weekend to attend my Graduation and relax. I looked at all the high end hotels and narrowed it down to ones near the beach.
I chose this one on two points location and real reviews.
From the second we walked up to the hotel from the taxi we knew we had made the best choice. We were met at the taxi and cases taken inside to reception.
At reception we were met by a very charming lady, who again excelled at customer service, although we was way earlier than check in time due to available flights, the lady found us a room straight away.
After we unpacked we took the lift to the roof top pool and bar area, what can I say but it‚Äôs a wonderful chill out area, staff again first class, very clean and lovely pool, we actually stay up there longer than we planned because it was so relaxing.
The public areas of this hotel are impeccable and Al staff amazing.
After visiting the beach we came back to our room, which was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the pool with a sea view, ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù.
The bed was large and comfortable with high quality bedding.
The room and bathroom were perfect, and the maid who cleaned our room was second to none.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough, thank you to all the staff for making our stay wonderful.",5,2023,07,09
16,Joan Pares!,I arrived hungry and tired and was met with a great big smile by server Joan Pares. He made some amazing local recommendations. I left feeling extremely satisfied and refreshed. Food is delicious! Joan Pares provided amazing service!,5,2023,07,09
16,Overall rather enjoyable,"Great hotel, excellent room, superb service. One gripe - breakfast is way too expensive (20 Euro per person per day if you pay in advance, eye-watering 32 Euro per person per day if you pay on the day). Service on the top terrace could have been a little more freindly and prompt. Very close to the beach, but be aware of the street robbers who target the guests!!!",4,2023,07,09
16,So good!,"Had such a nice time here, one of the best rooftops in Barcelona üòá the pool is amazing, the vibe is clean and polished, the staff are great! Attentive and so nice! The food was great aswell, and the drinks were really good.

16,Sofitel Barcelona Skipper ‚Äì Not a Sofitel and certainly not worth the money!,"Sofitel Barcelona Skipper ‚Äì Not a Sofitel and certainly not worth the money!

We stayed in Sofitel Barcelona Skipper four nights in June 2023. The overall experience was somewhat disappointing. And certainly not worth the price or the brand ‚ÄúSofitel‚Äù. Although the complex is recently renovated and in that respect very chic and functioning perfectly the atmosphere and the lack of service made it quite uncomfortable stay.

First of all our ALL Gold-status was not recognized in any real way. We got the welcome drink voucher but so does everyone on and above Silver-status. There was no priority welcome, no welcome amenity, no room category upgrade, no late check-out‚Ä¶ and yes, we did ask for these. All room categories above our Luxury room with balcony and seaview were available thru our stay in both ALL app and ALL website. The late check-out was given for half an hour after a quite hard demand from our side. Yes, 30 minutes!

The second problem was with a gentleman at the reception arguing with me about the slippers the first night. They have two sizes, but according to him only one. I had to get different sizes from our room to prove him. We needed two pairs of the bigger ones and got them in the morning. I just wonder what he is going to to say to a lady with slightly bigger feet‚Ä¶

Then the breakfast selection was very limited and partly not in good quality. If comparing for example to excellent breakfast in Sofitel Roma Villa Borghese were we stayed in April. Only a handful of vegetables, cold cuts and bakery products. Coffee was actually bad, obviously from some automate with powdered coffee and milk. The staff wondered three out of four of our mornings why we did not want any. On one morning they did not have any orange juice at all.

Finally the top pool and bar. It was full of beautiful people sipping their drinks and taking selfies. We are only wondering why we did not see any of these people anywhere else in this hotel, not in the lobby, not in the restaurants, not in the bar, not in the breakfast, not on the corridors even‚Ä¶ Well there was another pool in the shadows downstairs with plenty of room for us.

Something positive too: The room was really nice and new and the bathroom very well designed and functioning. Also a Special Thanks to the personnel in Tendiez Restaurant and Bar ‚Äì You all were superb! The late night room service was excellent! And Thanks to the Porters as well!

Never the less it is quite impossible to imagine to stay in Sofitel Barcelona Skipper again and pay over 500‚Ç¨ a night.",1,2023,07,05
16,Don‚Äôt miss the floral arrangements in the lobby. ,"The location to the beach and city is fabulous. The front desk, bar staff and breakfast staff were the best.

16,"Wonderful hotel, ok service ","Hotel looks wonderful, rooms are great, good facilities and the location is good if you want to be near the beach. Couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel at all really.

The only reason for not giving 5 stars is down to the service. I expect more from this hotel. Little things but they make a difference. Had to keep chasing for my luggage as I was being told different things from staff, I eventually tracked them down myself. The roof top is wonderful but the staff ignore you or are very slow to fulfil your order. 

Apart from that I would stay again. ",4,2023,06,28

The hotel has a great location, has all the amenities you can expect from a Sofitel but what makes this place stand out is some of the staff .

16,I stayed in Spain in March and hands down better experience this time around.,Very attentive. Wonderful service and breakfast provided on the patio overlooking the garden. The staff did not hesitate to make accommodations for any need small or big. Judith was wonderful every morning I came down to breakfast and made me feel at home. ,5,2023,05,21
16,Can't recommend this hotel highly enough!,"Everything about our stay here was perfect.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Special shout out to the barman Lukas, but everyone couldn't do more to help.

The rooftop bar, Il Cielo, is a great place to have a drink and a few nibbles while you relax on a chair or a sun lounger next to the heated pool. 

The room itself, a superior room, was absolutely fantastic. Huge room, immaculately clean and with a hugely comfortable bed. I must mention the air conditioning, which kept the room at a perfect temperature and was whisper quiet. Two bottles of water were placed in the room each day which is always a welcome touch.

The location is great, as you're right next to the beach and only a 25 minute walk into the city. I would definitely return to this hotel, and really look forward to coming back soon.",5,2023,05,18
16,Best rooftop Bar in BCN,"Amazing rooftop Bar - best views in Barcelona! Perfect service and real good food. Just relax and enjoy. Could really Recommend!!!!! Good athmosphere, chilly! Coming back to BCN, only one choice! Back to rooftop bar in Sofitel!!! Sommelier Pauline is the best!",5,2023,05,18
16,Will definitely return ,"Stayed for one night pre cruise and glad we did. Check-in was very welcoming and our room (sea view with balcony) was beautiful.  Rooftop bar was excellent with great food and service üëå.  Due to the weather and being very tired we decided to order dinner with room service, which was also excellent, and have an early night.  The bed was one of the most comfortable we've slept in. So much so we nearly missed breakfast!  Absolutely loved this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it, will definitely stay longer next time. ",5,2023,05,18
16,Tandiez Restaurant and Bar is absolutely worth a try,"An incredibly beautiful space, whether you sit inside or outside, the Tandiez restaurant and bar at the Sofitel was a great find.

Having seen it on a list of places to eat, we were a little unsure about the authenticity of a chain hotel‚Äôs restaurant. But we could not have been more wrong.

We were not staying at the hotel this restaurant is located in, but walked in and were instantly welcomed by the great staff. You can find the restaurant easily on the ground floor of the hotel.

In addition to being a stunning restaurant, it has incredibly tasty Spanish food, including the tapas. A highlight with the beef tartar but it was all delicious. It also had  some splendid wine, and the service from Maria Louisa made this a great Barcelona experience.

One of the food and service experience highlights in the area, it‚Äôs definitely a place to stop by and sample some delicious food if you are nearby - regardless of whether you are staying in the hotel itself.",5,2023,05,18
16,STUNNING !!,"Everything about this hotel was even better than expected. The room itself was nice - with many smart tech features - more than my tech skill level.

Check in and check out was smooth and all the staff members were friendly and efficient - especially the always smiling Axel.

The location was perfect near the Olympic port with a view of the Fish by noted architect Frank Gehry. The  beach walkway heading towards Barceloneta in a fun way to explore towards the sites.

Lastly - the breakfast was outstanding with outdoor patio seating - great way to start your day!

Luxury indeed !!",5,2023,05,10
16,Everything has been Perfect!,"Our experience at Sofitel Skipper Barcelona has been amazing. Nothing could have been better! Every detail has been taken care of accurately: the check in was smooth, the rooms amazing and perfecrly furnished and clean, the breakfast fresh and with a lot of choice, pool area breathtaking. The personnel of the hotel, extremely nice, available and always present to help us! ",5,2023,05,09
16,Fantastic hotel in a great position,The hotel is newly renovated and in a great location near the beachfront and also close to the city centre and metro station. The staff were universally friendly and helpful and made our 3 year old son feel very welcome. The room was great (Diptyque toiletaries great too). We loved the pool on the roof terrace. A great stay. Will definitely go back.,5,2023,05,04
16,Fantastic Place in Barcelona.  ,"We came here for a week at the start of April and it was fantastic.  We will stay here again.  The rooms are 5 star, the staff was superb and the location, for us, was ideal.  This hotel is near the beach and within walking distance or a short taxi ride away from the sights.  The rooftop pool was amazing (opens in April) and the food was excellent.  Can‚Äôt complain about anything.  ",5,2023,05,04

16,Paradise,"From the moment you walk into this hotel you feel like your at home by the very attentive staff, especially Jaun who served our drinks and lunch by the ground floor pool, this man is a true gentleman polite and very courteous.
We stayed in a second floor opera suite which was palacios and very large with fantastic amenities, if you want a sea view you need to be on floor four or higher for a truly spectacular view.
This hotel has a rooftop poll with a bar and serves light meals and a fantastic view at night.
Breakfast and lunch where fantastic with lots of attentive staff on hand to assist, this hotel is set 100yards from the beach in a fantastic part of Barcelona and all the main attractions can be reached on foot or by taxi, will definitely recommend and return to this hotel",5,2023,04,15
16,One of the Best Sofitel I have ever stayed in!!,"From the facade made out of a beautiful green wall to the lobby with warm colors finishing inside the cosy rooms, where every detail has been thought along with an incredible sense of luxury.
Furthermore, staff members make truly a difference at Sofitel Barcelona Skipper. We have been warmly welcomed by Andres, followed precious advices of Michail at the concierge and the friendliness of one of the porter (do not remember his name- sorry).
We felt at home and we hope to come back very soon, gracias!

16,Hospitality and Luxury at its finest!,Staying at this Sofitel was fantastic. Location was perfect.  Hospitality and service was top notch. Rooms super spacious and elegant. The most comfortable beds and bedding.  Staff was so accommodating to ensure we had the most perfect experience. Breakfast was  excellent. The restaurant was exceptional. Shout out to the most amazing concierge staff - Tiago Tavares and his Colleague. 100 percent amazing and knowledgable. Couldn't do enough for us to ensure we had the most pleasant stay at the hotel and where to visit in and around Barcelona. The front desk staff was also super amazing to ensure our experience was top notch.,5,2023,03,23

Close to the beach and  short walk to the city , we only had a superior room but absolutely fine looking to return later in the year. ",5,2023,02,22
16,Good place to stay,Nice renewed hotel. Breakfast was great. The location is perfect specially for the summer. 5 min to metro station.  Nice staff. The room was big enough. The gym was good equipped. We didn‚Äôt try the restaurant or bar. The only problem was that the room was really warm even if the heater was off. We asked 2-3 times per day to shutdown centrally the heater/air-conditioner. Because at some points came out cold weather.,5,2023,02,19
16,Worst service ever and also from the superior manager,"Worst service ever and also from the superior manager. We booked 2 Rooms they gave us in the begning the Keys to a wrong room then they wanted us to move one of the rooms, even though they Said you Can use the other room because we are sorry the housekeeping service forgot to clean your room, early in the morning the manager we ringing at the door and wanted us to pay for an ekstra room. We Said it wasnt our Fault and tried to let her understand what we spoke with the manager about the Day before as it was there fault. The manager janira was so rude and where not Welling to listen to what happend, and Said you need to pay for 3 Rooms or leave us.

16,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed a few nights with friends and I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. Everything was great. Everything! Amazing staff, incredible service, great rooms, and overall the best hotel vibe I have experienced in a very long time. Bartenders at Tendiez lobby bar stand out as winners, but everyone gets a medal. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2023,01,30
16,Outstanding experience at recently renovated hotel - a true gem,"I recently had the pleasure of organizing an event for our company's top managers at Sofitel Barcelona Skipper, and it was nothing short of perfect. 

The hotel has recently undergone renovations to the highest standards, and the rooms are truly outstanding - the design, materials used, and setup are all top-notch, and the beds are incredibly comfortable. 

The meeting rooms were also top-notch, and the food was fantastic. 

But what truly stood out was the staff - they were incredibly kind, warm, professional, and friendly. I would give this hotel a 6 star rating if I could - it was truly an outstanding experience.",5,2023,01,29
16,Always warm welcome here since used to be Pullman.,"I would like to give my opinion with score from 0 to 10.

Situation: 9/10 because is pretty closed to the beach, metro and commercial area by walking.

Rooms: 9/10 we had a room 433. The room is all renovated with Sofitel French touch style, design is all perfect and feel brand new accept the table and sofa near the balcony is not well situation to access to the balcony.

Cleanliness: 10/10 well because Sofitel just re-open since this October 2022 so everything still looks new and smells new. 

Staffs & service: 10/10 started from the front door, reception, restaurant, bar & rooftop staffs at Sofitel are very friendly and make you feel comfortable. Thanks to all of Sofitel Barcelona Skipper teams.

Food & beverages: 10/10 We had cocktails & dinner here (the Bar & restaurant behind or near the reception area). Cocktails is excellence, food is good and service is super professional. Thanks to all of staffs here to make us having a great night.

Breakfast: 8/10 varieties of foods is fine but the light on the roof is too much light and tables are too close to another table.

Amenities/Wifi: 9/10 I didn't try the rooftop pool & gym (so I can't give my opinion) but wifi and amenities in the room are excellence.

Overall: 10/10 would recommend to stay here and of course we are feeling good to be back here again.",5,2022,12,24
16,"Nice hotel, nice staff, enjoyable and successful  stay",Very nice hotel with excellent facitlities. Well done rooms and a very friendly and attentative staff make it a remarkable stay.

16,Excellent ,"Really nice hotel, staff helpful, nice room, supper comfortable bed, nice shower and bathroom. Good breakfast. Food was excellent. Really good stay.  One negative is sea view is perhaps not as scenic as some sea views but no big deal. Enjoyed our stau",5,2022,12,11
16,It's a Sofitel,"Great staff, beautiful decor, rooms are elegant with simple colors (i loved the white & blue carpet), main restaurant is nice with buffet breakfast (can add more of hot items), housekeeping service is perfect. Thanks to concierge guys they were so helpful with taxi arrangement during peak time. Thanks to Fatima (Guest Experience Manager) for warm welcome.",5,2022,12,07
16,Perfect hotel and location that lives up to its 5 star rating,"Excellent hotel in a perfect location right next to the beach. We were lucky to be the first ones through the door after their complete refurbishment and I must say it was very clean, quirky and modern. From the moment you walk into the hotel it oozes that 5 star feel. The rooms and suites were all kitted out with all the mod cons and were very spacious and quiet. We were lucky again that the Champions League match between Barcelona vs Bayern Munich was being played a couple of days after our arrival so we had the whole Bayern Munich team stay at our hotel for 2 days and we met a lot of players. Hotel staff were the most friendly I have seen and always willing to go that extra mile to make sure our group of 9 had everything we needed, 5 kids from 2-12 years olds and 4 adults. The bars and restaurant are excellent. The roof top bar is the icing on the cake and has magnificent views. I am glad I chose this hotel as there isn‚Äôt many other 5 stars around this area. Lots of shops, bars, restaurants in walking distance of a few minutes. Really enjoyed this trip and i recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in luxury.",5,2022,12,05
16,Amazing Hotel for a business trip,"I had an amazing stay during my visit to the IBTM in Barcelona, in which I chose to stay in the newly renovated Sofitel Barcelona Skipper.

It all started with the arrival having such an attentive doorman. After which the check-in was smooth and was greatly helped by Sofia and all her staff members. 

The room was amazing and the bed slept great. All in all a fantastic experience and I recommend this hotel to others.",5,2022,12,05
16,Newly Renovated and perfect,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days upon our initial arrival in Barcelona. We were a little hesitant because of the lack of recent reviews (found out it was because it recently went through a renovation and was closed) but it was amazing! So happy with our choice. The rooms, the service the food and the location were all top notch. We would absolutely stay here again. The attention to detail and service alone was fantastic, highly recommend.",5,2022,12,04
16,on a par with the best of the brand,"After renovation, the former Pullman is now an excellent Sofitel. The rooms are very tastefully decorated. The breakfast leaves nothing to be desired. The gym is spacious. The rooftop pool is (still) clearly too cold. The excellent staff deserve a special mention - reservedly friendly and competent. This Sofitel is on a par with the best of the brand, Frankfurt Opera and London St James.",5,2022,11,30
16,Best place to stay in Barcelona!,The hotel looks fabulous and the staff is super friendly and helpful. The bartender Juan is very kind and really made me feel welcome! I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who will travel to Barcelona. Thank you for the tour and the wonderful experience! ,5,2022,11,24
16,Best hotel in Barcelona,"I was with my parents last week and we really liked the decoration of the room, we usually stayed in sophitel for the quality. Very attentive staff, we met a boy named Jaime who behaved impeccable and provided us with some requests we had. Thank you very much and congratulations!",5,2022,11,22
16,A very chic stay in Barcelona,"For my first trip to Barcelona I chose the Sofitel Skipper hotel to stay in a truly refined setting just a stone‚Äôs throw from the Barceloneta sea. 

The hotel has been recently renovated and all the rooms are elegant, comfortable and meticulously cared for. I loved my room: equipped with every comfort and with really delicate wooden details. The bathroom was a real surprise, huge and super stylish, with everything I needed and more. In general, you will feel a chic atmosphere in all the rooms of the hotel. 

I had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant of the hotel, with a wide choice of Spanish tapas, and with a Mediterranean - and not only - cuisine, really tasty. 

Last but not least, a special mention to the people. All the staff of the hotel is really nice and helpful, and they made the stay even more welcoming.

I can‚Äôt wait to come back this summer to enjoy the outdoor spaces, the pools and the amazing roof terrace.",5,2022,11,18
16,Hell on earth...literally,"We arrived at the Sofitel to find the bathroom totally disgusting covered in some hair and yellow liquid. The reception was informed of the matter. When we returned 6 hours later the hair was cleared out but the yellow peeshish looking liquid stayed. The manager on duty was called at 11pm and as it turns out the soap was leaking and creating this mess...why was this not solved before is beyond me...The next day we came back to the hotel in the evening to shower and get ready for dinner and the room temperature was at 31.5 degrees. No need to take a shower, really. Anyhow, 5 hours later we come back to the same hell on earth along with a handwritten apology and some apples to go with it. I hope the apples are capable of battleling the heat, coz at that point that's all I wished for. Reception could not be reached so I had to leave my child sleeping in that hell and go downstairs only to be lied to about the situation. Apparently only ""a few rooms were affected and it wasn't the hotel's fault"". So in the middle of the night I had to drag my child and my belongings to a room upstairs and on the way, surprise surprise, met 6 more people with the same problem! Great job dear Sofitel, truly an amazing stay. The apples stated in the hellish room btw, so you can have them baked for breakfast.

The hotel with nice facilities from minute one I felt at home. I was also organized my stay by Miss Concierge who was very friendly.",5,2024,09,18
16,Excellent Birthday Party in El Cielo,"We celebrated my wife's birthday at the El Cielo terrace. The truth is all ten. From the preparation of the event with Joaquin and then as we were attended by mother Pauline and waiter Dany, who did an excellent job. He took care of us wonderfully. All perfect. Thank you.",5,2024,09,16
16,"Great staff, old hotel","Pro:
- super friendly and courteous staff
- very good and sufficient breakfast buffet
- is very close to the beach
- Metro and S-Bahn only a few 100m away
- (expensive) garage is available
- 2 charging possibilities in the garage (unfortunately only the lame 230V) , but almost always occupied:-(

Cons:
- Rooms should be renovated. Hotel is at most good ""Novotel"" standard, but no Sofitel!
- More charging options for EAutops and also faster than 230V
- Pool MUST be urgently renovated! Many broken tiles and very sharp-edged
- unpleasant smell in the sanitary area from the open drains",3,2024,08,24
16,A Business day hotel among flowers,We had some business meetings and were impressed by the hotel as well as the image care and floral decoration. I saw the flower assembly equipment and couldn't help but introduce myself. Pure art and design and taste in floral art. Thanks for making my business day a day between flowers that have given me light.,5,2024,07,25
16,Right...,"We went to the rooftop to celebrate my friend's birthday, the view with the pool is great, the prices are correct (165‚Ç¨ a good appetizer for 5/6 people), however the service was super slow and we wanted to order food again but the waiter was sitting at the next table talking to women. To order I had to get up myself... and the waitress apologized...",3,2024,07,21

16,TOP Location in Barcelona,"Excellent location, close to the sea and with the old town within walking distance with a pleasant walk. The hotel facilities are Top! We had a room with balcony overlooking the pool, a show!! The rooms are super quiet and spacious. Rich breakfast both sweet and savory, the 2 pools are very nice although the one on the roof really stole our hearts .. on the roof you can also eat or just have a drink. The staff is very attentive. Insomma tutto davvero perfetto! We will return üíì",5,2024,07,07
16,Experience with a friend,"We went on the terrace of the hotel, the place is super nice and very welcoming. 
I went with a friend and we had a cocktail üçπ super good recommend it 100% above all the love and professionalism of the beard Sibel who made me a super good cocktail without alcohol because I am pregnant. 
I recommend 100%",5,2024,06,29

16,The best hotel in Barcelona.,"Although I came for work, I wanted to entertain myself a little with everything this hotel offers, pool, bar, restaurant, and other incredible services. I loved Mamadou's cocktails and the delicious cuisine of the great chef David Andr√©s. In any case, I am very grateful to each of the workers for this experience.",5,2024,03,25
16,Modern luxury,"Modern, luxurious hotel of the best, obviously built for Sofitel, because the emblem of this hotel brand is even milled into a marble slab in the bathroom. The wonderful view of the sea is bought by the fact that it is located on the outskirts of the metropolis near the former Olympic site and the casino, an area where Barcelona is buzzing with leisure activities when the weather is nice. The metro station is practically on the doorstep and bus lines still ensure quick routes into the city center. Our junior suite was actually a real suite with separate rooms and an additional toilet in the entrance area, double washbasin in the bathroom, separate rain shower and free-standing bathtub of course, everything very spacious, homely and yet not overloaded. Small disadvantages: The hotel has no right of way, you are dropped off at the curb despite heavy traffic. The ""Tendiez"" bar, sometimes with live music, and the restaurant merge seamlessly into one another -- you don't really want to eat there. And you should check the bill -- mine was significantly different from the reservation through Accor.",4,2024,03,12
16,MWC event,"We have held events during the MWC including halls and rooms. Excellent service, close treatment of the staff both during the preparation and during the operation of the event.
Everything worked perfectly and the event was a success.",5,2024,03,05
16,The place to definitely return,"Absolutely everything from the beginning has been phenomenal in terms of service and facilities.
Which is a very important distinction since it is a common name neither in Spain nor in Europe in general. All the staff are very good in kindness and attention. Congratulations",5,2024,02,23
16,"Great beach location, excellent service","The hotel impresses with its location on the beach and in the city. It is 4 stops by train to the city. Taxis are in front of the house. You can get to the sea in a minute. 

The staff are all friendly and speak many languages. Even German is spoken by the intern Ben, for example. Everyone is committed and polite. 

The rooms are harmoniously furnished, the bathrooms are beautiful and equipped with everything you need. 

The high floors have the best view. 

There is a beautifully landscaped pool area and a rooftop with a bar. 

The modern restaurant and bar Tendiez are also recommended. The breakfast buffet (31‚Ç¨) as well. Great service there too.",5,2024,01,08
16,Great hotel,"Fantastic time, great service, great rooms, great breakfast! Located right on the beach you have both, beach feeling and still close to the city. Great service, especially from Giovanna and Ben at breakfast! The Tendiez restaurant in the hotel was also great. Overall, a full five stars!",5,2024,01,07
16,Nice and modern hotel. Great stay. Highly recommended,"It was a wonderful stay. The hotel and the rooms are very nice and modern. There was nothing to complain about. The staff were all very friendly, courteous and attentive, best wishes to the waiter Ben, who is currently doing his internship there. We felt very well looked after and comfortable. Pool areas on the ground floor and rooftop are beautifully designed. Unfortunately no Club Millesmie available.",5,2023,12,29
16,Excellent getaway to an unbeatable hotel,"Excellent getaway to this hotel with unbeatable service and excellent cuisine. New hotel with elegant, sophisticated and luxurious decoration. We will return for sure. The room has a magnificent design and a very comfortable bed, with duvets and pillows that we will buy at Sofitel Boutique.",5,2023,12,14
16,Excellent place,"Very good service, delicious food, we had a happy time as a family and Mary's attention was friendly and helpful. We will surely return another time. We loved the atmosphere and the spectacular decoration of the restaurant.",5,2023,12,05
16,Good attention,"The dinner was great, the atmosphere was great and the attention was 10. Highlight the good treatment of Marc and the entire Tendiez team.
All dishes have a very careful and elaborate presentation, as well as an excellent product.",5,2023,11,09
16,We will repeat without a doubt,"An incredible experience! The receptionist Jihane was a sweetheart, she helped us throughout the stay and made my anniversary with my partner as pleasant as possible by helping us with absolutely everything. She was super attentive and pleasant. We will definitely return to this hotel because of its wonderful staff on our next adventure through Barcelona!‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2023,10,12
16,Conditionally recommended,"A Sofitel hotel is always a good address. And that's why we chose the Sofitel Skipper Barcelona. As an Accor Platinum member, we get a room upgrade. Subject to availability, of course. But we didn't get one here, and we found the statement a bit far-fetched. The hotel was not fully booked. The room we booked was nice, but small. That's not the standard for a Sofitel. The photos on the internet are very embellished. There is a pool on the roof by the bar. And also one on the ground floor next to the restaurant. We were lucky every afternoon and found a place. The breakfast buffet is actually very extensive, but there was only orange juice on the first morning. On all the other days, they said that no oranges were delivered. I find that a bit strange. The hotel bar is very well stocked, and they serve very fine drinks. We also visited the restaurant. But we can't recommend it. The prices are very high and the portions are correspondingly small. And not really good either. The service wasn't exactly great either.",3,2023,10,11
16,My favorite place in Barcelona ‚ò∫Ô∏è I fell in love.,"It is my third time coming here and the sky is the most beautiful terrace in all of Barcelona. I loved everything here, the pool, the sofas, the view and the drinks - wow!!! I was left speechless about this site. I went to visit him on a Wednesday between 12-3pm with a friend in the month of October. This place brings me a lot of tranquility and the weather now seems like it's still summer. It is my favorite place in Barcelona. Many thanks to the service too, especially to Mamadou. He attended to us and was very attentive and super friendly.",5,2023,10,11
16,TO REPEAT,"A respite, a paradise of tranquility and good food.
Meritxell and Marc's attention is fantastic, exquisite, leaving space and respecting time.
The flavors of the fine and charming dishes, the treatment of the product and the presentation of 10.
Unbeatable quality-price ratio.
Thank you very much for everything‚ô•Ô∏è",5,2023,09,28
16,"Great Hotel, excellent restaurant, unbeatable service","I had lost a little confidence in the Accor group hotels, but I must admit that the Sofitel Skipper Barcelona has managed to meet each and every one of my expectations. Extremely friendly professional staff. Fantastic restaurant, pleasant rooms in perfect condition.
If the hotels and workers of the Accor group were half as friendly and professional as they are in this hotel... frankly BRAVO to the entire Skypper team",5,2023,08,30
16,room service,"Incredible attention from all the service and even more so from the rooms, very friendly and gentle, especially Roser. We spent some very comfortable days. The truth is, we would repeat this incredible experience again.",5,2023,08,20
16,Beautiful elegant hotel,"The Sofitel Skipper in Barcelona is an elegant hotel not far from the sea. You can get to the city center in just a few minutes by taxi. 

The staff is friendly and attentive, and looks after the well-being of the guests. The furniture is modern and elegant, and you feel comfortable there. 

There is a smaller pool on the roof terrace, as well as one on the ground floor. Depending on the time of day, you have to make sure you get a place to lie down. 

The breakfast area is very large and the buffet is extensive. The bar is also well stocked and they make extremely good cocktails.

What we didn't like was that the rooms were very small compared to hotels in this chain in other places in the world. We also had dinner there, and the food was overpriced and not particularly tasty. We will go to other restaurants in the future. That's why we're giving it a lower rating.",4,2023,08,07

16,Ein Traum!,"Nagelneues Haus der Sofitel-Marke und endlich auch in Spanien!
Nach dem Umbau vom Pullman zum Sofitel und drei Jahren Wartezeit konnten wir es endlich ausprobieren. 
Toll!
Check-in/Aufenthalt/Service alles 5* w√ºrdig.
Best Team ever!
Unsere Juniorsuite war bestens Ausgestattet. 
Edle Materialien, ger√§umig und ein Traum von Badezimmer.
Sofitel-Betten herrlich!
Der Turndown-Service wurde auf Anfrage durchgef√ºhrt.
Hier vielleicht etwas mehr Detailliebe.
Gastronomie ist top. Selten so ein tolles Restaurant/Bar-Erlebnis gehabt. Unverkrampft entspannt 
Preise auch hier v√∂llig angemessen. 
Fr√ºhst√ºck,  naja, einfach top.
War in der Zimmerrate enthalten. 
Die beiden Pools waren f√ºr uns zu frisch Ende M√§rz 
Sch√∂n gestaltet und Roof Top mit toller Aussicht.
Am Strand gelegen und sch√∂n zum laufen.
Als Paar hat uns das Hotel voll √ºberzeugt.
Unsere Anspr√ºche √ºbertroffen!
